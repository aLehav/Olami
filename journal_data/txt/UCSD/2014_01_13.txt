UCSD announced 
this week that it has 
officially appointed 
Steve Gamer as the 
new vice chancellor-
advancement. Gamer, a 
long-time development 
director at UCLA, will 
be responsible for over -
seeing campus fund -
raisers and maintaining 
relations with UCSD 
alumni starting Jan. 13. 
“We are pleased to 
welcome Steve Gamer as 
the newest member of our campus 
leadership team. Steve will bring expe -
rience and insight into the impor -tance of private support for public 
universities ,”  Chancellor Pradeep 
K. Khosla said in a Jan. 6 
UCSD News Center press 
release. “Faced with contin -
ued state and federal budget 
cuts, UC San Diego and our 
sister campuses are becom -
ing increasingly reliant on 
philanthropy to achieve our 
mission. ”  
Gamer comes to UCSD 
after working in the UCLA 
development department 
since 2002. He served as 
the director of develop -
ment and external affairs 
for the International Institute until 
UCSD biologists have optimized a 
way of preventing the human immune 
system from rejecting human embry -

/uni25B6 Arrests Made in San Diego Sex Trafficking 
Scandal: Two North Park gangs were charged 
with sex trafficking, among other crimes, 
on Jan. 8. The gangs have also been indicted 
with murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, 
robbery and drug trafficking charges.
Several agencies, including the FBI, 
arrested the suspects on the morning of Jan. 
8. All were either gang members or associ -
ates. Fourteen members were in San Diego, 
with two others in Arizona and one in New 
Jersey. Police had already apprehended four 
other members, while three remain at large.
The suspects allegedly sold sex in hotel 
rooms across 23 states. Detectives identified 
60 possible female victims with 11 minors as 
young as 15 years old

7, Democratic Senate President  pro Tempore 
Darrell Steinberg presented a $1 billion pro -
posal to support free public preschools in 
California.
The bill would provide free preschooling 
to all California four-year olds. Steinberg said 
universal preschool would lower crime rates, 
increase the number of college students and 
level the playing field among students from various socioeconomic statuses.
According to Reuters, California 
Republicans referred to the proposal as a 
“jobs program for the teachers’ union. ”
Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget proposal includes 
$452 million for K-12 schools, a $39 million 
spending increase from last year. However, the 
governor’s budget does not include a dedicated 
allocation for universal preschools.

residents to encourage the use of reusable bags.
The park stopped offering plastic bags in 
2011 when its Turtle Reef exhibit opened and 
has since discontinued the use of plastic cups, 
plates and utensils.
The announcement comes a week after 
Los Angeles’s plastic bag ban went into effect 
on Jan. 1. Other California cities in the Bay 
Area have already adopted similar bans that 
prohibit the distribution of plastic bags and

2006. He later became the executive 
director for campuswide initiatives 
and individual giving. Gamer was 
also appointed as executive director 
of The UCLA Foundation in 2009, 
spearheading multiple development 
projects. 
Gamer oversaw philanthropic 
efforts on the UCLA campus itself 
and on various establishments like 
the Broad Stem Cell Institute and 
California NanoSystems Institute. 
The news release noted that Gamer 
gave “special focus on donor rela -
tions and stewardship, scholarship 
fundraising, online giving and cham -pioning the conversion of a database 
gift accounting system to a constitu -
ent relationship management sys -
tem. ” 
Under his leadership, UCLA 
received over $400 million from 
donors in the 2011 to 2012 fiscal year, 
as stated in UCLA Today. Gamer 
also worked in the highly successful 
Campaign UCLA, which raised over 
$3 billion 1995
Along with his position as associ -
ate chancellor-advancement, Gamer 
will also serve as president of the 
UCSD Foundation.
“I am excited to join UC San 
Diego to partner with the academ -
ic leadership, alumni, friends and staff as we work together to enhance 
philanthropy at this amazing cam -
pus, ” Gamer said in the UCSD news 
release. “I look forward to helping 
UC San Diego — one of the top 15 
research universities in the world — 
secure the funding needed to contin -
ue its excellence in all areas, from the 
sciences to engineering, international 
relations to the humanities. ”
UCSD was able to raise $150 mil -
lion from private donors in fiscal year 
2012-2013. Gamer says he will strive 
to increase this economic support in 
2014 and beyond.

Associate News Editor  different species; however, in these 
cases, xenograft rejection often 
occurs, as the animal’s own immune 
system may reject the graft.
Xu’s group of scientists then 
looked into improving methods of 
allografting — which is the trans -
plant of tissues between the same 
species — as an alternative. His team 
created a “humanized” mouse; they 
took immune deficient laboratory 
mice and grafted human fetal thymus 
tissues and hepatopoietic stem cells 
from a human fetal liver donor. The 
mice have an immune system similar 
to that of a human’s, which effectively 
simulates allograft rejection.
“We have improved a method 
to protect allografts, which is tra -ditionally achieved through the use 
of immunosuppressants, ” Rong said. 
“The advantage of the local immune 
environment is that it prevents the 
need for lifelong immunosuppres -
sants. ” 
He and his team of researchers 
have developed a local immune envi -
ronment that provides local protec -
tion from the host’s immune respons -
es.
These humanized mouse models 
allow biologists to narrow potential 
immune suppressing molecules down 
to two effective molecules, CTLA4-
lg and PD-L1, which inhibit T-cells 
involved in immune rejection.
“The ultimate goal of this research 
is to benefit human health, and this 
way, we can apply it to humans more 
easily, ” Rong said. By creating a local immune envi -
ronment, it safely protects stem cell 
grafts from the allogeneic immune 
rejection without needing systemic 
immune suppression.
“However, there is a disadvantage 
to this local immune environment, 
which is that it may evade the sur -
veillance of the immune system com -
pletely, ” Rong said. 
Xu said that the disadvantage can 
be rectified by introducing a gene in 
the immune expression cells that kills 
the cells off —  a suicide gene.
“The humanized mouse system is 
really a powerful model with which 
to study human tumor immunity, ” Xu 
said in a UCSD News Center release. Xu and Research Team Developed Local Immune Protection

The Tragic 
Failure of
Democracy:
Partisanship
NIC O  H EMSL EY NAHEMSLEY@ucsd.eduJUSTIC E   IS   S ER VED
The essential qualm I have 
about partisanship is that 
it turns off people’s brains. 
Democracy fails when its citizens 
don’t scrutinize critical issues, and 
that’s exactly what partisanship 
does: It skews our thinking process. 
It’s hard to stay informed about 
every policy, so we subscribe to a 
party and follow its lead. The thing 
is, parties have a motive beyond 
public good. Politicians are looking 
to fundraise, to get reelected and to 
maximize their power. This is where 
the problem lies, because accuracy 
and consistency are sacrificed in 
favor of constructing a fitting argu -
ment. Their followers, however, see 
them as proponents of important 
ethical decisions.
Partisanship is an unnecessary 
construct, and the tribalism associ -
ated with it corrupts our decision-
making. Any particular political 
agenda can be bent to mobilize both 
Republicans and Democrats based 
simply on rhetoric. Geoffrey Cohen, 
a professor of psychology at Stanford, 
found that simple endorsement by a 
party gleaned support from a wide 
variety of undergraduates claiming 
affiliation with that party. It’s said that 
Republicans and Democrats prioritize 
fundamentally incompatible values, 
but in truth, each side of a policy can 
be reconfigured to endorse the inter -
ests of politicians in their respective 
party. Policy differences boil down 
to how an issue is worded and who 
endorses it, rather than its content.
When we believe we’re engaged 
in reasoned policy discussion, we’re 
really engaged in a convoluted effort 
to rationalize our tribal affiliations. 
Psychologists call this “motivated 
reasoning. ” A quick analysis of politi -
cal history will show that Republicans 
and Democrats often hold similar 
ideas, but they frame them differently 
depending on the reaction they want 
to provoke from their supporters. For 
example, the Affordable Care Act was 
designed by the Heritage Foundation, 
an American conservative think tank, 
and in 1993, Republicans actually 
supported the individual mandate. 
Nineteen Republican senators co-
sponsored the bill, while only two 
supported it from the Democratic 
side. Once the ACA was adopted 
by Obama, however, Republicans 
withdrew support, while Democrats 
endorsed it. 
In a Washington Post column, 
Ezra Klein quotes NYU political 
psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s argu -
ment that “Thinking is mostly just 
rationalization, mostly just a search 
for supporting evidence. ” The con -
tention over the individual mandate 
is a perfect example of this process 
at work. We engage party loyalties, 
and our ethical decisions become 
more dependent on who is endors -
ing a position rather than its actual 
content. Politics are reduced to 
tribal fights and intellectual gym -
nastics that feel, to participants, like 
virtuous policy debates. We need 
to utilize democracy’s potential by 
discussing and relaying accurate 
information.
To suggest party system reform 
as a solution would be overly ideal -
istic, but if we’re at least conscious 
of our tribalism and more con -
scious of the rhetoric that’s being 
thrown at us, we can make and 
endorse better political choices.
QU ICK   T A KESTHIS YEAR, THE NC AA IS EXPE CTED TO RE CONSIDER A WIDELY DEBATED POLI CY THAT WOULD ALLOW DIVISIO N-I 
SCHOOLS TO OFFER ADDITIO NAL STIPE NDS TO THEIR STUDE NT-ATHLETES.
Division-I athletes choose an active lifestyle 
oriented towards their sport and are currently 
provided with ample financial compensation; 
these individuals receive free room and board, in 
addition to a cost-free tuition and do not need 
an additional $2000 stipend. Being exempt from 
these expenses is a privilege, not a right, and funds 
should not be abused to accommodate students 
beyond their needs. 
For the last 40 years, D-1 athletes have been at a 
significant financial advantage, enjoying free appar -
el, transportation, meal plans, housing accommoda -
tions, books, medical attention and tuition all free 
of charge. National Collegeiate Athletic Association 
President Mark Emmert’s plan increases the scope 
of these benefits and also imposes stress on uni -
versity budgets. In a September 2013 USA Today 
article, Rutgers athletic director Julie Hermann said, 
“Tuition is going up already $8,000 a year, and now 
you’re adding $400,000 [in stipends], ” expressing 
the irony and insensibility of such a decision.
Under Emmert’s proposal, athletes will be 
endowed with extra funding while the remaining 
student body will continue to struggle with ever 
increasing education costs. Boise State University 
president Robert Kustra urged proposal advocates 
to compare the supposed lack of support for stu -
dent athletes to that for non-athletes “who are mak -
ing minimum wage, collecting tips [and] trying to 
find their way into their next semester. ” 
While D-1 players should undoubtedly be 
rewarded for their efforts, a decision that expands 
the fiscal gap and reinforces double standards is 
both unwarranted and illogical. Current benefits 
are not only adequate, but also generous. Stipend or 
not, athletes should rejoice in the freedom of get -
ting a full scholarship to do what they love.

Staff WriterCollege Athletes Deserve Rewards for 
Balancing Academics and Sports8IaUMV\8TIV=VNIQZTa*MVMÅ\[
Wealthy Sports-Oriented UniversitiesGenerously Compensated Students Do 
Not Need Expensive Additional Stipends
Finances are one of the primary factors student 
athletes consider when choosing which university 
to attend. Adding a stipend to a full-ride scholarship 
would cause student athletes to seek out schools that 
offer the most money in their package. Institutions 
that devote more money to athletics will be able to 
offer higher stipend amounts, creating an unfair 
advantage in attracting their pick of players.
If approved, the policy would have each uni -
versity create a stipend based on the “full” cost of 
attendance and would need to determine how much 
students spend on items like toiletries or gasoline. 
National Collegiate Athletic Association President 
Mark Emmert estimated that the “full cost” amount 
could range up to $6,000. Without a universal 
formula to fairly calculate the “full” cost, wealthier 
schools could manipulating the stipend as an extra 
incentive to attract athletes. 
Finding the money to pay for it also presents 
challenges. Schools have limited funding set aside 
from their budget for sports. Sidney A. McPhee, 
head of the NCAA ’s Student-Athlete Well-Being 
Working Group, noted that the less wealthy Division 
1 colleges would not afford the additional costs 
and major conferences would gain an even greater 
advantage. USA Today found that of the top 100 of 
227 public D-1 schools, only 22 were able to gener -
ate revenue, with the remaining not even being able 
to cover their operating expenses.
Adding an unregulated stipend will cause stu -
dent athletes to attend wealthier D-1 schools, tak -
ing attention away from the less wealthy schools’ 
athletes hoping to take their sports career further. 
Schools without these potential star athletes end up 
not having the media that pays for their athletic pro -
grams, widening the gap between universities that 
make money and those that are losing it.
—  DEREK UNG
Staff WriterCollegiate athletes have an extremely time-
consuming and physically demanding lifestyle. 
An additional stipend is well deserved and would 
reward athletes for the long and strenuous hours 
they put into school and sports.
According to two separate surveys conducted 
by the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
in 2008 and 2011, student athletes consistently 
spend just as much time on their sport as stu -
dents do on their full-time jobs. A large number 
of Division I athletes across multiple sports invest 
over 40 hours per week competing, practicing and 
in the training room. The survey explains that 
this average does not account for coaches’ unof -
ficial demands, which further increases their time 
commitment. 
Y et unlike individuals who work full time, 
these athletes also balance schedules as full-time 
students. Because busy schedules prevent most 
student athletes from getting jobs, the stipend 
would be a valuable tool to help students pay for 
groceries, simple dates and maintain a relatively 
normal college experience. 
Although some D-I athletes leave college 
debt-free due to scholarships, they generate a lot 
of revenue for the NCAA and are entitled to a 
cut. The Pac-12 has made a 12-year, $2.7 billion 
television deal with ESPN and FOX. According to 
ESPN, in 2008 alone, some schools made upwards 
of $123,769,841 from athletics. Y et athletes do 
not see a dime of this money, and under NCAA 
policy, are unable to profit even from their own 
signatures. 
The monetary impact of student athletes is 
not negligible. These athletes spend long hours 
playing for their schools, and it is about time they 
received adequate compensation.

As a college student, grocery shopping is one of the most crucial 
yet hardest chores out there. With almost everything in the 
fruit-juice section labeled as “all-natural” and more in the pro -
cessed food aisle, it is hard to determine what is actually “natural. ”
Despite existing confusion, on Jan. 7 the Grocery Manufacturers 
Association submitted a letter to the Food and Drug Administration 
attempting to allow foods that contain genetically modified organ -
isms be labeled as “natural. ” This is only one example of many lobby -
ing attempts made by the big-name food manufacturing companies. 
Oppositions from consumers have sparked many heated debates due 
to FDA ’s lack of definition of the term “natural. ” Whether this request 
will go through is uncertain; however the FDA has done enough dodg -
ing since 1992 when it comes to food labeling regulations. Clear and

accurate food labeling is essential in 
order for consumers to make educated 
buying decisions. The FDA must take 
a proactive approach to tighten label -
ing guidelines and inform the public 
about what exactly is in their food.
Because the FDA currently lacks 
a specific definition of the term 
“natural, ” companies have taken 
advantage of the ambiguity to lead 
consumers on. PepsiCo, the manu -
facturer of Naked Juice, settled a 
lawsuit last August regarding its 
use of the phrase “all-natural” on 
its fruit juice labels. The company 
argued that the phrase was meant 
to describe the fruits and vegetables 
rather than the vitamin boost 
chemically added to the drink. 
Completely unaware of the added 
chemicals, consumers argued that 
they were led to believe that the 
entire product was organic. Due to 
lax regulations, other companies 
are getting away with telling half 
the truth by hiding crucial infor -
mation from consumers, while the 
FDA continues to do nothing. 
A Jan. 8 Chicago Tribune article 
explained that similar lawsuits 
against General Mills and Campbell 
Soups and Gruma have made no 
progress to the current situation. 
The FDA dodged creating new 
regulations by rejecting action “in 
the context of litigation between 
private parties. ” After years of 
neglecting the issue, the FDA needs 
to take action and conduct research 
to resolve the problem by setting 
strict labeling guidelines.
In order to stop wasteful spend -
ing on both the part of food-
manufacturing companies and con -
sumer, a set of comprehensive and 
mandatory guidelines is needed. 
In 2011 and 2012, more than a 
million Americans petitioned for stricter labeling yet the FDA chose 
to remain silent. After spending 
nearly $30 million on a Washington 
state ballot initiative to mandate 
food labeling, the initiative was 
narrowly defeated and all efforts by 
pro-labeling advocates were wasted. 
In California, a similar initiative, 
Proposition 37 was also defeated by 
merely 2 percent. Due to the lack of 
mandate from the FDA, unneces -
sary money is invested into a prob -
lem that can be simply solved with 
federal support. 
The drive against the food label 
debate is the fear of losing sales 
when negative information is pre -
sented on labels. However, contrary 
to common beliefs, consumers are 
more likely to purchase products 
with additional description about 
the ingredient, even if it is negative 
information. Cornell University 
Professor Harry M. Kaiser points 
out in a press release that “even 
seemingly negative information was 
valued over just the label itself. ” This 
is further proven in a poll conducted 
by the New Y ork Times shows that 
93 percent of consumers favor some 
kind of useful description of the 
ingredients used on the label. The 
FDA should stand by the major -
ity consensus and place consumer 
rights above private businesses. 
Although food-manufacturing 
companies continue lobbying for a 
more lenient definition of the term 
“natural, ” the FDA needs to take 
action to ensure transparency in food 
labeling and protect consumer rights. 
Consumers have every right to know 
what is in their food and what they 
are buying, and the FDA should stand 
by its principles and take a more 
proactive role to ensure the quality of 
consumer products. SOLVE FOR X By Philip Jia

UCSD junior Eric Suen and senior 
Kevin Liang call their creation 
a frame for nature’s art. A com -
pact, two-tiered desktop aquarium, the 
EcoQube runs on aquaponics — an agri -
cultural technique that doesn’t use soil — 
to convert waste from fish into fertilizer 
for plants grown in water. 
Liang believes aquaponics is the 
future of agriculture and that this con -
cept, on a larger scale, can potentially 
solve global challenges, such as food and 
water shortages. According to Liang, one 
billion people lack clean drinking water, 
and food shortages are growing each day. 
With aquaponics, food can grow 50 per -
cent faster using less space and 90 percent 
less water.
With an chilhood interest in aquari -
ums, the EcoQube founders, who met in 
high school, started their venture in 2008 
in a small garage in San Francisco.
“I set up two aquariums in the begin -
ning, but it kept going to three, four, five 
and on, ” Liang said. “ At one point, I had

A  CLEVER  CUBE  OF  
CONSERVATIONTime-lapse, a series of photos compiled 
together to generate a video, is another way 
in which people can share their experi -
ences. Michron — a programmable time-
lapse device created by an MBA student 
from UCSD’s Rady School of Management, 
Gregory Horvath, and Stanford alumnus 
Steven Hibbs — makes it easy for users to 
do just that. All users have to do is con -
nect the portable device — a small black 
box that fits in the palm of a hand — to a 
smartphone, program it, and then attach it 
to a camera.
“People tell their stories on Facebook, 
Twitter and on Instagram through photos 
and videos, ” Horvath said. “We think that 
people are going to start telling their stories 
through time-lapse. It’s just a different way 
to communicate a story. It can capture time 
in a way that cannot be captured with just 
standard photos or videos. ” 
From humble beginnings — what start -
ed out as simple sketches in the backseat 
of a taxi in China — Michron has become 
a reality. 
With their creation, Horvath and Hibbs 
hope to increase the accessibility of time-
lapse at an affordable price, as they feel that 
other time-lapse devices on the market are 
too expensive. 
“In the past, Steve has worked on these 
types of devices: intervalometers [mecha -
nisms that take pictures automatically after 
a set delay time], ” Horvath said. “In January 
2013, I asked him for a recommendation for 
a good basic intervalometer, but he couldn’t 
come up with one that was worth buying. ”
With the lack of affordable, high-quality 
intervalometers on the market, Horvath 
and Hibbs took it upon themselves to cre -
ate a product that was both functional and 
cost effective. Using a 3-D printer, they 
manufactured the prototype of Michron 
and priced the final product at $50 apiece.

18 tanks running. If you’ve ever 
been addicted to anything, whether 
it’s a game, a sport or a TV show, it 
was the same. I couldn’t stop. ”
When Suen and Liang came 
to UCSD, they chose to live off 
campus, so they could bring their 
aquariums with them, moving their 
workspace from a San Francisco 
garage to an apartment closet.
 Eventually, the two were able 
to start their online aquarium store 
called Aqua Design Innovations 
Shop in 2010. The store will carry 
the EcoQube once it’s released to 
the public, which is estimated to be 
this July.
Both Suen and Liang picked 
up various aquarium-related jobs 
throughout their high school and 
undergraduate years at places 
such as the California Academy 
of Sciences and Aquatic Central 
(the largest aquarium store in San 
Francisco). Through the EcoQube, 
they want to apply their acquired 
knowledge of aquariums in order 
to share the concept of aquaponics.
“We need a vehicle to deliver 
this to people, so they can do great 
things with the concept,” Liang 
said. “EcoQube is the vehicle to 
get other people to build compa -
nies using this 3,000-year-old tech -
nology that’s a billion times better 
than Monsanto’s [the world’s largest 
agricultural company] newest and 
greatest [agricultural techniques]. ”
Liang and two other engineer -
ing students from UCSD designed 
various prototypes of the EcoQube 
and after receiving feedback from 
others, developed a final product.
The EcoQube consists of five 
parts: an LED light, an LED UV 
sterilizer, an aquaponics filter, an 
aquarium and a base. The aquari -
um is situated on top of the base. Attached to that is a filter with a 
small space to hold a plant, which 
recycles fish waste in the aquarium 
into fertilizer. The plant is used to 
purify water in the tank. At the very 
top, there’s a UV light that sterilizes 
the water.
Liang noted the difficulties 
of raising funds for this startup. 
They initially had some revenue 
from their two prior businesses sell -
ing aquarium goods and installing 
aquatic ecosystems. They also used 
student loans, and supporters gave 
them discounts on aquarium sup -
plies.
From their Kickstarter cam -
paign, which ran from Nov. 30, 2013 
to Jan. 12, 2014, Suen and Liang 
raised $79,026, nearly double their 
original goal.
The EcoQube has already gained 
recognition in design circles. The 
team placed third in the Zahn Prize 
competition and first in the Pitch 
competition, both entrepreneurship 
competitions that award cash prizes.
Suen and Liang believe that the 
EcoQube will succeed because it’s 
both low maintenance and aestheti -
cally pleasing. They hope that the 
EcoQube will influence people to 
live more environmentally con -
scious lives.
While the EcoQube will be Aqua 
Design Innovations’ first product, 
the team has big plans for future 
projects. One plan they have in 
mind is a home aquaponics system 
that would produce enough food for 
up to two people. It would be the 
first product of its kind to be mass 
marketed.
Suen and Liang have shown that 
hard work, even when starting from 
the smallest space, can grow into 
something great.screens, which means that its user 
interface is conducted remotely, 
through the Michron App on a 
smartphone (available for Android 
and iPhone). 
Users create their own settings 
on the Michron App and can pro -
gram the Michron device itself 
after connecting the device to their 
smartphones with a programming 
cable. Once users upload their set -
tings to the device, they can discon -
nect the device from their phones 
and reconnect it to their cameras. 
“We wanted to have the usabil -
ity of having the interface on the 
phone, but we wanted the complete 
freedom of the phone, ” Horvath 
said. 
The ability to use the phone 
while taking a time-lapse was some -
thing that other available interval -
ometers couldn’t do. They had a 
user interface that was accessible 
by way of smartphone; however, 
when in use, the intervalometers 
would take control of the entire 
smartphone. 
That meant that if a time-lapse 
were set for five hours, the user 
wouldn’t have access to other 
smartphone functions for those five 
hours and would have to wait until 
the time-lapse was complete. 
Michron, on the other hand, 
grants users the freedom to use 
their smartphones while taking 
time-lapses. Michron can create 
time-lapses on its own, either with 
user-specified settings, or by using 
a feature called Auto Time-Lapse.
With Auto Time-Lapse, users 
can choose from a list of pre-made 
settings and shoot time-lapse in 
auto — meaning that the camera 
automatically takes pictures at a 
certain delay time. 
For example, if the user were to 
shoot a time-lapse of clouds over 
a long period of time, Auto Time-Lapse would automatically set the 
camera to take a photo once every 
three minutes, since clouds move 
relatively slow. If the user were to 
choose the “people” option, Auto 
Time-Lapse would set the camera 
to take a photo every two seconds, 
since people move quickly.
“Using Auto Time-Lapse, you 
can do two things: Your camera 
can create all of its own settings, and Michron will work with it. And 
if you want it to, it will create all 
of your settings for taking a time-
lapse itself, ” Horvath said. “ Auto 
Time-Lapse allows people who have 
no experience with photography or 
time-lapse to start creating some -
thing awesome. ”

McCann Heads Attack, Scoring 23 on Friday, 22 on Saturday
Pioneers scoreless in the final five 
minutes. 
The Tritons took advantage of 
their defensive stops, aggressively 
attacking the basket to create free 
throw opportunities, which gave 
them the lead. Up by three points 
with 55 seconds left, senior guard 
James McCann drained a tough 
turnaround jumper to seal the win. 
He finished just shy of a triple-dou -
ble, scoring 23 points, a career-high 
10 rebounds and seven assists.
“They were huge for us, ” McCann 
said when asked about the fan sup -
port. “This is our first game back 
with our students on campus, so we 
got a nice crowd, and we just fed off 
their energy. ”
The Tritons were back in action the following day to take on Cal State 
Monterey Bay. With a career high 
effort from sophomore guard Hunter 
W alker — 25 points and six rebounds 
— the Tritons were able to take a 
12-point lead at the first half. McCann 
also contributed his usual numbers, 
scoring 22 points and dishing out 
seven assists.
“ As a shooter, you need to have 
that confidence, ” Walker said when 
asked about his performance. “Today, 
I just felt good. Once you start mak -
ing shots, you bring more energy to 
the table. ”
The Tritons didn’t look back after 
the half, continuing to play at their 
own tempo, which eventually led to 
the blowout win. 
Olen credited the team’s resil -
iency and persistence for its two 
victories.“ After coming off of last weekend’s 
results, we had a really good week of 
practice, ” Olen said. “We didn’t feel 
sorry for ourselves, we came out, 
played good basketball, and we got 
the results we were looking for. ”
The Tritons will play their next 
two games in enemy territory, as they 
travel to face Sonoma State and San 
Francisco State.         
“This weekend was big for us, ” 
Walker, who made three baskets 
from beyond the arc, said after the 
game. “We let a couple [games] go 
that I think we should have got. 
This is going to be good for our 
confidence moving on to two good 
teams where we have to take care of 
business again. ”/uni25B6 MEN’S BA SKETBALL, from page 12 
Volleyball Slated for Home Opener Saturday against BYU
dle blocker Mathew Schnitzer led 
the UCSD offense Friday night with 
six kills apiece. Schnitzer collected a 
career high five blocks and made his 
first six collegiate kills.
Saturday, UCSD headed to Malibu 
to take on sixth-ranked Pepperdine. 
A four-point run gave the Waves the 
early 6–2 lead in the first set. 
The Tritons never threatened 
Pepperdine’s lead, losing the set 
17–25. After falling behind 10–6 in the second set, the Tritons were tied 
the score at 19–19 on aggressive play 
and solid blocking. But the Waves 
answered by tallying the next six 
points and won the set 25–19. 
From there, the Waves closed 
out their fifth straight victory over 
the Tritons dating back to the 2011 
season.
“Pepperdine sided out very well 
tonight, so we needed to have bet -
ter offensive production, especially 
on our first swing in serve receive, 
to keep us in the games, ” Ring said to the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“Each game, we found a way to string 
together some good plays and close 
the gap in the score but never found 
the means to pull ahead. ”
UCSD continues conference play 
next weekend to face California 
Baptist on the road Thursday, Jan. 
16, before returning to RIMAC for 
their home opener on Saturday, Jan. 
18, against BYU.
Tritons to Play Sonoma State, San Francsico State on the Road
the field. 
“We definitely didn’t play our 
best. We kind of dug ourselves into 
a hole, ” junior guard Stephanie Yano 
said. “We kind of shouldn’t have 
been in that position in the first 
place. ”
In spite of a poor offensive show -
ing, the Tritons salvaged the win 
thanks to the late game heroics 
from Yano and junior center Dana 
Webster.
With barely over a minute left to 
play, Yano hit a clutch three-pointer 
to cut a four-point deficit to one and put the Tritons in a position for a 
comeback.
Soon after, Webster drove 
towards the basket and nailed a 
layup while being fouled with only 
14 seconds remaining. She then 
sunk the free throw to put the 
Tritons up by two points. 
“[The play] was designed for 
me, ” Webster said. “Since I hadn’t 
had a basket that night, it was pretty 
likely they were going to go off to 
[Seto]. ”
On the following and final pos -
session, the Otters’ push to force 
overtime came down to the wire, as 
they missed two layups before the buzzer sounded. 
The Tritons are now 8–4 overall 
and 5–3 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association.
“I think we got all of our ugly 
games out of the way, and we’re just 
ready to kick some butt through the 
rest of conference schedule, ” Y ano said. 
The Tritons will hope to do so 
on Friday, Jan. 17, as they travel to 
play at Sonoma State and will also 
face San Francisco State on the road 
the following day. Both games start 
at 5:30 p.m.

Tritons Win Two 
Straight at Home M EN 'S BAS KETBALL
B Y  Daniel  sung   STAFF  writer     PH OTO  BY  Al wi n  Szeto  
The UCSD men’s basketball team was victorious in its 
weekend home stand, defeating Cal State East Bay 80–70 
on Friday and blowing out Cal State Monterey Bay 93–70 
on Saturday after dropping two in a row the week before. 
The Tritons move up three spots in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association standings, placing them back in the hunt 
for the CCAA playoffs.
The student fans were in full support at the Tritons’ first 
game of the academic quarter against Cal State East Bay. The 
game was close throughout until freshman guard Adam Klie 
hit back-to-back three-pointers to give the Tritons an eight-
point lead. The Alaska native ended the game with 11 points 
and four rebounds. Sophomore center Zach McMillan also 
provided a solid contribution off the bench, scoring 10 points 
and eight rebounds.
“Zach’s improving every day, ” first year head coach Eric 
Olen said.  “He works hard every day in practice. He does a 
great job on the defensive end and on the glass. He was able to 
give us some offense tonight, which was a huge boost for us. ”
However, the Tritons only led by three points at halftime, 
and the game remained tight until the final minute.
The home court advantage proved to be helpful late in the 
game as the Tritons’ energized defense was able to hold the

State East Bay and Cal State Monterey Bay.
The UCSD women’s basketball 
team closed out a five-game home 
stand with a loss on Friday evening to 
Cal State East Bay, followed by a close 
victory on Saturday against Cal State 
Monterey Bay. 
In their first matchup against 
the East Bay Pioneers (8–5 overall), 
junior guard Miranda Seto served 
as the team’s bright spot in an oth -
erwise uninspired 78–58 loss. Seto 
led the Tritons on the attack with 
19 points and finishing 6-for-8 from 
the field. 
“I thought Miranda played with a tremendous amount of energy, ” 
UCSD head coach Heidi VanDerveer 
said. “I thought we played hard all 
night. ”
But the Tritons struggled through -
out the second half to keep the contest 
close in spite of a 39–37 first half score. 
While the Tritons shot 50 percent 
(13–26) from the field in the first half 
and went an impressive 6-for-9 from 
the three-point line, they seemed to 
fall apart after halftime. In the second 
half, UCSD sank a feeble 30 percent 
(7-for-23) of their shots from the field 
and went 1-for-6 from beyond the arc. 
Beyond poor shooting, the Tritons 
also found themselves overwhelmed 
defensively by the Pioneer squad, which finished the game at 56 percent 
(30–53) from the field. 
“I think in the second half we 
missed some shots and then real -
ly didn’t get matched up a couple 
times in transition, ” VanDerveer said. 
“[We] gave up some easy baskets. ” 
However, the Tritons followed this 
loss with a close win against Cal 
State Monterey Bay, barely edging the 
Otters by a score of 40–38. 
The Tritons, who came in as 
clear favorites to win against the 3–6 
overall Otters, finished the game 
with a disappointing 29 percent 
shooting percentage (15–51) from Women’s Basketball Splits at Home  W OMEN 'S  BAS KETBALL

Volleyball opened MPSF conference play, losing 
to USC on Friday and Pepperdine on Saturday.
The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
suffered two tough losses in its sea -
son openers last week. On Friday, 
the Tritons fell to Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation opponent USC in 
straight sets before losing on the road 
to Pepperdine the following day.
“We’ve opened the MPSF sea -
son with two very good teams in 
USC and Pepperdine, ” UCSD head 
coach Kevin Ring said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “For us, it is 
a matter of getting comfortable com -
peting night in and night out and the 
ability to play good, solid volleyball 
from start to finish. Each game we’ve 
played in has had bright spots. As we 
become more consistent, we’ll begin 
to win the close games. ”
Facing off against sixth-ranked USC on the road, the Tritons strug -
gled on their side of the net. UCSD 
tied the opening set at 5–5; a four-
point run soon extended the Trojan 
lead to 15–9. The Tritons were unable 
to get closer than four points over the 
remainder of the frame.
In the second set, the Trojans took 
a 13–6 lead before solid Triton block -
ing gave UCSD its first lead at 23–22. 
But three straight points earned USC 
the set victory. 
“USC got off to a great start 
in game one, and although we hit 
okay, we didn’t do enough to slow 
their offense, ” Ring told the UCSD 
Athletics Department after the game. 
“Game two, we did a much better job 
of pressuring USC with our serve and 
better blocking. ”
