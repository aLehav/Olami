The A.S. Council excused 
six senators from possible impeachment last night, 
including A.S. President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine. 
Although only three weeks 
remain until the 2010-11 student council takes office, A.S. Advocate General Parminder Sandhu sub-mitted six resolutions to impeach councilmembers who have consis-tently missed council or committee meetings.
According to the A.S. con-
stitution, voting members who receive more than three unexcused absences are subject to impeach-ment. During Winter Quarter, the council voted to impeach Biological Sciences Senator John Ehrhart and Sixth College Senator Kevin Nguyen.
The six senators considered 
for impeachment yesterday were Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey, with three absences; Revelle Senator Arvind Satyanarayan, with five absences; Campuswide Senator Adam Kenworthy, with three absences; Campuswide Senator Desiree Prevo, with three absences, Campuswide Senator Ben Hassine, with three-and-a-half absences; and Arts & Humanities Senator Omar Khan, with eight absences.
Because roll is called twice dur-
ing each Wednesday-night meeting, an absence during either call counts as half an absence.
Sandhu said there is still value 
in pursuing impeachments, despite the short amount of time the cur-rent council has left in office.
“I think that, at this point, it’s 
really the principle — a lot of these people who are being impeached, one was impeached before but it failed, so we’re doing it again, ” Sandhu said.
A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 
he believes that excessive unex-cused absences negatively affect the accountability of the governing body.

I-House 
Denies Bias in Selection Procedure
By Kelly Kim
Staff Writer
Having concluded a 10-day investigation into 
the integrity of UCSD’s International House admis-
sions policies, administrators are denying allega-tions that their selection process is racially biased.
Though I-House Director Christi Gilhoi did not 
release any specific details about the investigation, she said that both the UCSD Office of Campus Counsel and an outside statistical analyst were con-tacted to review the admissions procedure.
“The study found no evidence of bias with 
respect to cultural categories, ” Gilhoi said. “Our legal counsel has identified no legal problems with the admissions process. ”
The review was launched on April 10, after the 
system came under fire last month when Gilhoi mistakenly sent a confidential e-mail to everyone on the I-House listserv. 
The e-mail — which was sent to all current 
I-House residents — contained a spreadsheet with the personal information of 148 students who applied to live in I-House during Fall Quarter 2009. Some students who received the information expressed concern over columns on the spread-sheet that identified the “citizenship” and “cultural identity” of applicants.
Gilhoi said that indicating one’s cultural iden-
tity and national origin is an optional component of the application. See IMPEACHMENT page 2
See I-HOUSE page 6For seven years, California students have been fighting for a bill that would provide financial aid to undocumented immigrants. The existing law AB 540 allows long-time California residents 
without official citizenship to pay in-state tuition at public universities, but does not provide that they receive aid. 
Under the California Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors Act, AB 540 students would be able to receive financial aid from the state — which proponents say is a major step toward making a col-lege education accessible to students who have not been granted U.S. citizenship.
Carmina Ocampo, a lawyer for the Asian Pacific 
American Legal Center, said that  — despite the high profile of the bill — there remain misconceptions about it would work and who it would impact. One common assumption is that most students protected by AB 540 are immigrants from Latin America. In fact, almost half are Asian-American. 
“It’s surprising, because there’s a widespread stereo-
type that Asian-Americans are the model minority, ” she said. “They seem privileged in terms of education and finances and are overrepresented in academic institutions  — but they can actually be a vulnerable and marginalized group that come from poor families struggling to pay for

vote and to represent, ” he said. “If they 
are absent, they are not representing. They are not being [senators]. I’m con-cerned that we’re not doing our job to police our own council — to the own rules that we prescribe by. ”
He criticized the senators in ques-
tion for not attempting to excuse their absences.
“It is really easy to be excused from 
meetings, ” Gupta said. “ All you have to do is send an email in to the council explaining why you need to be absent, and you are almost always excused. I can’t make excuses for them anymore. ”
In the discussion proceeding the 
vote, councilmembers pointed out prior mistakes in the absence-counting process.
For example, one of Prevo’s 
absences was from a Sun God com-mittee meeting that she missed on Feb. 5. However, she said that she had cleared her absence prior to the meeting because she had work, and that the excusal had not been properly recorded. 
“This is ridiculous, ” Prevo said. “I 
work really hard, and this is really dis-respectful. I think this just shows how faulty the system is. ”
Ben Hassine agreed that the count-
ing system sometimes does not line up with the amount of effort council-members contribute.
“Keep in mind, I’m going to be here 
next year, ” she said. “I work hard and I usually never miss Senate without missing council, and I always try to excuse myself. ”
Gupta said there was no basis for 
the impeachments being pardoned, and that all members in question were still eligible for impeachment. Sandhu added that he would bring the matter to council again. 
According to Sandhu, once a coun-
cilmember accrues more than three absences, he submits a resolution for impeachment, which is then voted on by the Campus Affairs Committee. If passed, it is submitted to the entire council. Impeachment requires a two-thirds vote to pass.
Sandhu expressed concern that 
those in associate vice president posi-tions — who are paid $3,500 per year — cannot be impeached, even though some of them have accrued as many as 13 absences, because of their non-voting status.
“They have three times as many 
absences as the rest of council, and they are subject to the same attendance code as senators, ” Sandhu said. “Their 
exemption is a double standard. ”
He said the council should imple-
ment an AVP impeachment process.
 “Let’s say the Vice President of 
Finance Peter Benesch doesn’t like one of his AVPs tomorrow — he can just remove them, ” he said. “So, at this point, it’s hard to remove the AVP , because it’s a personal decision. I’m trying to find a way to make it less of a personal decision and more that if you’re not meeting the absence requirement, then you immediately get punished. ”
However, Gupta said AVP absences 
do not affect the council’s operations, since AVPs do not have a vote.

tuition. ”
Ocampo said the center where she 
works often encounters immigrants who come to the U.S. with their families on work or visitor visas, only to have the documents expire without their knowledge. 
“Some students don’t know they’re 
undocumented until they apply for a driver’s license, or to college, ” Ocampo said. “It’s a shock to them, and Asian-Americans are an invis-ible group because they don’t want to expose themselves. ”
Ocampo’s hypothetical paral-
lels the experience of Michelle*, an Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-more and undocumented immi-grant from Singapore who wished to remain anonymous. Michelle said that many students in her situation are unwilling to speak publicly about their immigrant status, which keeps others from understanding how many students the bill would pos-tively affect. 
“I came to the United States with 
my mom under her working visa, and she was fired for economic situ-ations, ” Michelle said. “We suddenly lost our statuses. I haven’t told all my friends yet — it’s something I’m try-ing to find the right time to do. ”
According to Connie Choi, an 
immigration rights lawyer for APLC, the 2000 U.S. census found that there were 2.5 million undocumented stu-dents under 18 living in the coun-try — of these, 40 percent lived in California, and 21 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. 
According to documents released 
by the university in 2010, there were 572 potentially undocumented undergraduate AB 540 students with-in the UC system as of 2008. Of these, 263 were Latino, 263 were Asian, 3 were black, 23 were white and 20 were from an unknown ethnic back-ground. In total, under AB 540, these students paid  $26.9 million less than they would have with out-of-state tuition. Of these, 81 are potentially undocumented undergraduate stu-dents at UCSD.
“ A lot of people have stereotypes, ” 
Michelle said. “[People say] illegal immigrants [are] from across the border, [that] ‘they’re Mexicans’ — that’s just not true. The D.R.E.A.M. Act is something that will affect a lot of people, regardless of background. ”
UC Office of the President 
spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka said the university supports the passage of the D.R.E.A.M. act, though it is too early to speculate on when — or if — the legislation will pass.
Steve*, a Warren College junior 
who wished to remain anonymous, said that although undocumented immigrants currently make up less than three-tenths of the UC student population, their status prevents them from receiving state financial aid and therefore makes it more dif-ficult for them to attend college. As

Tempers flared last night as 
councilmembers, with only two meetings left in term, dis-
cussed impeachments and student-org funding — again.
The meeting began with a presen-
tation by Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue, who stressed that 
one role of the council is to improve campus climate, and announced that the 2010 graduation speaker will be Laren Poole, a Marshall College alumnus. Poole is a co-founder of Invisible Children, a group dedicated to protecting chil-dren in Africa.
Triton Television Station Manager 
Thomas Dadourian announced that 
the station was planning to pair up with individual college stations to share knowledge and ensure that the smaller stations didn’t “die out every four years. ” 
Advocate General Parminder 
Sandhu presented awards to council-
members who had good attendance records or had improved over the past quarter. Recipients included Transfer Senator Adam Powers, President 
Utsav Gupta  and Campuswide 
Senator Tobias Haglund. Haglund 
was not present to receive his award. 
Vice President of Student Life 
Ricsie Hernandez announced that the Sun God Festival store is now open on the second floor of Price Center, near the old post office.
A.S. President-elect Wafa Ben  
Hassine announced that she was working with the Housing, Dining and Hospitality committee on a project that would allow students to exchange dining dollars with other students. 
“Mark Cunningham supports it 
full on, even though they don’t make a profit, ” Ben Hassine said. “I almost feel like there’s something shady going on. ”
During campus affair committee 
presentations, the council passed an amendment that requires the outgoing VP of Student Life to appoint mem-bers to the next year’s campuswide committees by Week Eight, instead of only “when requested to do so. ”
The council then turned to the 
question of wheth-er to impeach oft-absent vot-ing members. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena argued that 
very few people 
eligible for impeachment during Winter Quarter had been impeached. 
“We impeached two people 
though there were 11 eligible, ” he said. “One had like 13 absences and the other, well, I don’t even remember what they look like. ” 
All impeachments were failed.Afterward, councilmembers debat-
ed whether they should fully fund an event put on by Students for Justice for Palestine on April 20. A.S. Council policy determines that it funds only half of all contracts, but, due to a mis-understanding, SJP put on the event expecting to be fully reimbursed. 
The council was concerned about 
being inconsistent, but Campuswide Senator Adam Kenworthy  disregard-
ed these claims. 
“This council has never been con-
sistent, ” Kenworthy said. “If consisten-cy was a batting average, we would be traded. ” The council reimbursed SJP .
The meeting ended with Sandhu 
again bringing up impeachments. 
“I’m like the guy in Green Eggs 
and Ham , ” he said. “I will talk about 
impeachments with you on a boat, on a house, outside a house, on the sea. ”>+:]M,ZWX[*a\W,Q[K][[

Y ou may not be able to afford an 
iPad just yet, but you might want to 
start saving up for the next version, because researchers are develop-ing technology that will transmit viral videos like those on Y ouTube 
at higher speeds and qualities than ever before.
Combining silicon chip technol-
ogy with the latest wireless com-munication tools, researchers at the Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits group are testing the limits of the amount of data that can be transmit-ted wirelessly — at a speed faster than your laptop’s current network connection.
“We’re all sort of pushing to help 
deliver next generation wireless services to smartphones, notebooks, iPads and more, ” electrical-engi-neering professor Lawrence Larson said.
Larson has been teaming up with 
fellow electrical-engineering profes-sors Peter Asbeck, James Buckwalter and Gabriel Rebeiz for the past decade to study the evolving tech-nology of wireless data transfer. 
“We’ve been working on it for 
10 years, and will be working on it for the next 100, I’m sure, ” Larson said. “Communications is kind of an insatiable human need, and that’s not going to be satisfied any time soon. ”
The work of Larson and his 
colleagues is primarily focused on video transmission, which requires sending significantly more data through the air than sound or text alone.
“In order to transmit video to a 
wireless device, you have to be able to transmit lots and lots and lots of bits very, very quickly over the air, ” Larson said. “It’s kind of like a greater order of magnitude than any other application — more than e-mail, more than voice. Video is a dramatic increase. What we have to do is go to higher frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum. ”
While television signals travel 
at about 500 MHz and cell phone signals travel at about 2,000 MHz, Larson and his team are developing chips that can handle signals rang-ing from 20,000 to 60,000 MHz.
“It’s really because video has this 
amazing requirement of data rate bits per second, we have to go [to] these higher frequencies, ” Larson said. 
Larson said the main challenge 
his team faces in their research is developing hardware capable of operating at such high frequencies while still maintaining the precision and accuracy necessary to produce a quality video or transmission.
In order to test the different chip 
prototypes, researchers monitor the quality and speed of each transmis-sion.
“We have test equipment that 
generates the exact type of signals that might be received wirelessly or the types of signals you might want to transmit wirelessly, ” Larson said. “Then we measure our devices and see how well they do against the specifications that are needed in order to work well. It’s the same kind of test equipment that people in industry use to test high-speed wireless equipment. ”
Larson said that, eventually, 
all consumer products will feature wireless communication capabilities.
“The number of devices [that can 
communicate wirelessly] is really kind of limited, ” he said. 
“In the future, I think that the 
theory is that almost every manu-factured object on the planet will have the ability to communicate wirelessly — so books, and packaged food and clothing and appliances and everything on earth that is man-ufactured will be able to wirelessly connect to the Internet. ”
Larson said the continued 
development of wireless technol-ogy — specifically, by firms located in California — will allow the state to maintain a technological edge in the U.S. “We really feel that this kind of work is part of the creativity that will spawn new jobs and new startup companies, and new oppor-tunities for wireless devices, ” Larson said. “Hopefully one of the big implications of our research is that this will help California maintain its high-tech lead in the wireless indus-try on a worldwide basis. ”

Out of 106 votes 7%    I don’t know.19%    
Just when we thought we were 
waking up from the Triton foot-ball dream, A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta has gone and hired an athlet-ics consultant to measure the feasibil-ity of his monumental pet project. The student council is chipping in $7,000 for university athletics expert 
Carl McAloose to evaluate the cost of 
a brand-new football program along with what it would take to move existing UCSD teams to Division-I. 
Despite the fact that A.S. 
President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine has made it clear she plans to trash Gupta’s dream faster than we can say “student fees, ” the hiring of McAloose is not entirely in vain. Not only 
did the money come from the A.S. 
Enterprise income (not direct activ-ity fees) but Gupta persuaded the administration to cover the remain-ing $21,000 of the $28,000 cost — no small feat in the age of the bleeding budget. At town halls and public meetings held this year on the pros-pect of a football team, its estimated cost has fluctuated from $1 million to $16 million. A professional study of what it would take to make it happen is valuable knowledge for everyone involved in the debate. If it’s far too expensive, it will hopefully put the pigskin to rest, or if it turns out more feasible than we thought, a future 
council could continue to negotiate a 
deal with the university.
Though we predict that the final 
estimate won’t be worth all UCLA ’s school spirit and Berkeley’s prestige combined, we’re much more hope-ful that McAloose’s study will bring us one step closer to a D-I athletics upgrade (which Ben Hassine is much more ready to support). 
Understandably, many university 
athletes don’t want to make the move — it would be a bummer to go from being the No. 1 D-II school in the nation to being at the bottom of the top. Should UCSD make the upgrade, Triton athletes would have to wait as long as four years before being able to compete at nationals. But as our teams hit their D-II peak and the upgrade option opens up next fall, it’s time to think long-term. 
Football isn’t the sole reason we’re 
only third best in the UC popular-ity contest; our D-II status is just as much a reason we’ve always lagged in reputation behind Berkeley and 
UCLA. An upgrade would place 
us in the same league as our sister schools and pit us against top-caliber teams across the country — garner-ing more publicity from spectators, current students and prospective students alike. We’ d also be able to offer athletic scholarships; suddenly a 70-degree year-round climate wouldn’t be the only perk we could offer high-school recruits uninterest-ed in attending a nerdy science-only institution. 
Most importantly, the prestige 
and student investment that would come from a D-I ranking could bring in some sizeable donations for 
the Alumni Association for some-
thing other than cancer research. And hey, if a the D-I move works out, maybe a few years down the line, we can talk football. Until then, baby steps.

In a time when almost every business this side of Wal-Mart is posting profit losses, it’s especially hard to be the lit-
tle guy with a niche market. And if anyone knows about failing businesses, it’s us.
UCSD’s student-run co-operatives 
— whose $3 wraps and $2 DVD rentals provide an invaluable alternative to the Price Center mall — have proven to be no exception. From 2005 to 2008 — during an intense period of construction at the old Student Center — the Food Co-op, the General Store Co-op and Groundwork Books all suffered financially from decreased foot traffic. Since then, not one has been able to rebound in full force.
Tomorrow, co-op representatives will 
meet again with Director of University Centers Paul Terzino to negotiate lower rent — and, because they’re paying as much as $1,700 per month while provid-ing valuable student resources, the break 
would be well-deserved. 
Terzino has made it clear that University Centers — which also collects rent from commercial establishments paying far higher rates for prime Price Center real estate — could not to afford to eliminate the co-ops’ rent altogether (as many members have expressed is their ideal). But Terzino did say he would be willing to settle on lower rates, or even establish a pay-as-you-can rent system that would allow the co-ops greater flexibility in making ends meet.
We’re hesitant to buy into Terzino’s 
claim that University Centers — which also collects a $76.50 quarterly fee from every student — couldn’t support itself without the co-ops’ estimated $2,845 monthly contribution. But as strongly as we support the co-ops, we also believe they should be held more accountable in case they’re granted lower rent. 
Unless you’re a Student Center group-
ie, chances are you haven’t set foot in a co-op since you were required to buy an obscure Marxist textbook a few quarters back. And there’s no denying they cater to a minority niche of hip humanities professors and cigarette fiends. As a result, 
there are few efforts outside the Student 
Center to advertise the co-ops’ many 
strong selling points — which more 
than justify a detour from Library 
Walk.You’re Looking  
Pretty Cool in That AIDS T-Shirt
When I heard they’ d built 
a brand new Urban Outfitters in Pacific 
Beach, all that’s trendy in me couldn’t help but swing by for a brief tour. 
Being a self-loathing hipster of 
sorts, I’ll admit I hate myself for get-ting juiced about $30 hair clips and shorts that give me camel toe. My theory is that I’m drawn to the faux-alternative chain because I’ve been hypnotized by genius psychological marketing strategies for so long that there’s no more hope of resisting the establishment’s indie-chic pull.
So I dropped by for a visit. And, 
as I was standing behind some spray-tanned PB rats in line for a fitting room — tapping my foot to the whiny sleeve-pop (yeah, bet you haven’t heard of that one) on the store’s omni-present soundtrack — my eyes wan-dered to a mannequin in a black shirt.
At first glance the shirt seemed 
typical Urban: slim-fitting, covered in colorful images reminiscent of a cooler decade and overpriced as hell. But a closer look revealed the graphic to be three grinning black kids hover-ing above funky block-letter text that read “HAITI. ” 
My first reaction was to get pissed 
at whatever corporate slime decided it was chill to squeeze profit from the decade’s most devastating natural disaster. However, easily distracted by something covered in sequins on the fitting-room return rack, I soon forgot about it entirely. 
But once I’ d officially evacuated 
the store — $100 poorer and high on consumerist thrill — I decided to do some sleuthing on the subject.
Turns out clothing company 
OBEY partnered with Awareness and Artists For Peace and Justice to develop the trendy Haiti attire as a way to raise money for the country in turmoil. Apparently, when somebody buys one of the shirts, all profits go directly to the cause. Hipster gets his outfit, Haiti gets its money. Everybody wins, right?.
Still, the idea that some trend-
mongering kid would buy the T-shirt  — probably because it matched his skinny jeans and made him look compassionate and informed at some Owl City concert — sort of makes me hate humanity.
More and more, companies look-
ing to capitalize on a charity cam-paign are making a big fashionable spectacle out of it. Bono may have intended to heal the world when he started his Product Red campaign in 2006 — sprinkling iPods and Starbucks cups with a sharp red label to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria — but he also developed a way for corporations to profit from bourgie rich folks who want to look like they’re giving back.
The Haiti shirt campaign is no dif-
ferent. No matter how much money 
is donated to the suffering country, it 
doesn’t change the fact that half the people who contributed to the cause didn’t give a shit about it. I guess it’s better than the profits going straight to another trust fund — but it’s still pretty embarrassing that our coun-try’s current most popular form of philanthropy hinges on the American consumer’s bad sense of taste.ALYSSA BEREZNAK

GET YOURS.DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre
Off  the Beaten Path, Smokes and Cheeses Abound 
Dear Editor, 
I love co-operatives. They can be 
extremely successful. I belong to REI, 
which is a co-op, as well as Canada’s Mountain Equipment Co-op, which I think is the best thing since sliced bread. The co-op model is one of the most underappreciated and ignored business models in America — some of the most well-informed people I’ve encountered don’t understand how co-ops work.
Contrary to popular opinion, a 
co-op is not a commune or a collec-tive. It is not ideologically socialist, communist  or capitalist. It is a formal 
organization with owners like any other corporation. The difference with a co-op, though, is that the orga-nization’s owners are the consumers, rather than investors. A co-op exists to serve the people that use it, rather than make money for the people that own it. It is rather like a union, but for consumers — those that use the space get to say how it runs.
With this understood, though, it 
doesn’t seem to be the case that the General Store or the Food Co-op are, in fact, co-ops. It is unclear why the default assumption is that the indi-viduals currently there are those who should be there.
So, a proposal: Given that the 
university student population is con-stantly changing, the A.S. Council and Graduate Student Association should consider deciding yearly to whom it should give the space, based on an application process that preserves the spirit and intent of the co-ops while recognizing that no particular set of students have a right, by heritage, to manage the space. Alternatively, it could mandate a genuinely co-op-style governance structure, in which users of the co-op vote on a board of directors who are then responsible for choosing who manages the space.
Otherwise, it’s just a club with 
cash registers and a guaranteed space.

Needs Reevaluating
The Food Co-op, for its part, sells 
affordable vegan and vegetarian grub 
without the side of MSG from chains like Panda Express. Groundwork Books offers $1 book sales on used reads from fairly popular authors. The Che Cafe hosts shows regularly for under $10. The General Store is the only place on campus to buy cigarettes. 
Making greater efforts to publicize 
events put on by the co-ops wouldn’t hurt either. The occasional fiction and poetry readings might not draw a Loft-sized crowd to the muraled doors of the food co-op, but it wouldn’t hurt to advertise — especially if you con-sider yourself an all-student service. It could even be as simple as hiring a student artist to create promotional signs to hang around campus.
Due to a lack of consistent promo-
tion, most students aren’t even aware of the cheap curry and American Spirits that the co-ops have to offer — and it’s no wonder a small customer base of close friends can’t provide enough profit to make rent.
Despite the fact that longtime 
co-op members such as General Store core member Andrew Rubens insist that student-run co-operatives are not businesses — but rather student organizations providing products in exchange for money — the co-ops still have to assume some level of fis-cal responsibility — which includes recruiting a solid customer base and keeping profit records. Business or not, it’s the purpose of any buy-and-sell system to at least break even.
Because the co-ops have yet to 
present Terzino with any sort of records, it isn’t apparent exactly how large a break they’ d need to stay in the clear. Still, we’re inclined to say rent should be halved — in exchange, of course, for a simple list of buys, sells and promotional efforts. After all, the co-ops’ operation relies on finances, so some form of rent should be maintained at least as a symbol of exchange.
 Of course, instituting these kinds 
of changes may require more orga-nization or helping hands, but if that means pulling the co-ops out of the red — and teaching students how to run a more sustainable operation — then it’s more than worth the effort.

APPLICATIONS AT UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG.  6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  THURSDAY , APRIL 22, 2010  NEWS
“They are used for statistical pur-
poses only, and in room selection, to 
keep with the theme of International House as half U.S. and half interna-tional students, ” Gilhoi said.  “For example, in a four-person apartment, there would be two U.S. students and two international students. ”
Tatjana Lischetzki — who went by 
the name of Elizabeth* in a previ-ous Guardian  article and was denied 
acceptance to I-House last year — met with Gilhoi and ERC Resident Dean Rey Guerrero on April 16 to discuss the content of the leaked e-mail.  
“They used this example that if 
there are already too many people from the UK, and even if a bunch of UK students got higher scores than someone from France or Italy, they will pick from the applicants from France or Italy, ” Lischetzki said. “So even if other people might have higher scores, they can still not get in, because there are too many applicants already accepted from that area. ”
John*, an anonymous student who 
used the e-mail address concerneduc-
sd@yahoo.com  to criticize the admis-
sions system on the I-House listserv, sent Houston an e-mail on April 9 detailing his concerns.  
He received an e-mail response 
from Houston on April 10 acknowl-edging his concern and notifying him of the investigation.  
John said that I-House’s practice 
of accepting 50 percent U.S. students and 50 percent international students should be an illegal quota system. 
“There is just no way that the 
50-percent quota for international stu-dents is constitutional, ” John said.   
He referred to the 1978 Supreme 
Court decision in Regents of the 
University of California v. Bakke , which 
allowed race to be a consideration in admissions policy — in the interest of academic diversity — but held that quotas were illegal. 
Additionally, Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimi-nation on the basis of race, color or national origin for all programs receiv-ing financial assistance from the fed-eral government. 
Lischetzki added that she is skepti-
cal as to why I-House officials are not providing the details of their recent investigation.
“It speaks to the fact that there is 
something that they might not want us to know, ” Litschetzki said.  “They think its better to not show anything. ”
According to Gilhoi, I-House 
reviews applications in two rounds. The first round takes place in February, and is only open to current UCSD stu-dents. The second round, which takes place in June, is open to international students, new transfer students and new graduate students. 
All applications are initially 
reviewed by a selection commit-tee of 24 current I-House students, including both U.S. and international students.  This committee — which Gilhoi said reviews applications “inde-pendently and without discussion” — scores the applicants based strictly on essay responses, a creative submission and letters of recommendation.
This score sheet is sent to a com-
mittee of staff members from both I-House and ERC Resident Life. The committee considers the preliminary rankings — along with “additional cri-teria” such as housing guarantee status, student conduct and gender balance — to choose the initial round of admits.
“We analyze how the applicant 
would play a role in promoting cross-cultural communication and the exchange of global ideas and opinions in the community., ” Gilhoi said. “The committee members evaluate the rea-son for the applicant’s interest in liv-ing in I-House, the activities they are interested in being involved with and how their past experiences and inter-ests would contribute to the I-House community. ” 
Nevertheless, John — along with 
several other students who registered complaints after the March 4 e-mail — said he is doubtful that past experienc-es and additional criteria are the only reasons some applicants were rejected. 
“Obviously they claim to not use 
race, but I think they have already acknowledged racial discrimination, ” John said.
The UCSD Legal Counsel could 
not be reached for comment.

To ﬁnd out how, just go to:  an undocumented immigrant who 
moved to the U.S. from Argentina at age 10, Steve said he considers California his home, and should not be penalized because of circumstanc-es over which he had no control.
“I definitely think of California 
as home, ” he said. “I know Argentina is a big part of my life, but my time for development and education was in California. It is my life; it is my home. ”
Steve said that UCSD’s proximity 
to the Mexican border is frequently a source of stress for undocumented students on campus, because they could easily be deported.
“It’s especially diffi-
cult for San Diego stu-dents because we are so close to the border, and we are in danger of being deported at any time, ” he said. “We want to make sure that fear is taken away for students who just want to go to classes to better them-selves. ”
Steve said he is work-
ing to pressure state leg-islators to take action on the bill, because he feels that receiv-ing residency status is crucial to any-one hoping to seek employment in the U.S. following graduation.
“We have students who may not 
be able to work in their field, ” he said. “Even though we are working so hard for this degree, we may not be able to practice. ”
A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West is currently lobbying for the D.R.E.A.M. Act in conjunction with the United States Student Association and other UC campuses.
“Education is a right for all stu-
dents, and everyone should have access to financial aid… not based on citizenship, ” West said.
She said she has plans to lobby 
political candidates who don’t support the act, such as Republican guberna-torial candidates Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner. Both have declared undocumented students to be a financial burden on the UC system, and said they will not support the act.
“[The office of] External Affairs 
will lobby the legislators who do oppose the D.R.E.A.M act, ” West said. “I know Meg Whitman is run-ning — we’ll try to convince her that prioritizing students’ access and affordability is an issue. We’re going to make sure that we’re being heard. ”
The offices of Meg Whitman and 
Steve Poizner could not be reached for comment.
In addition, West said, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger has been an 
obstacle to the bill’s passage through the state Senate. Schwarzenegger has stated in the past that it is not fis-cally responsible to provide tuition relief to undocu-mented students. 
“It’s been consistently 
voted down by the gov-ernor of California, ” West said. “He’s the only one preventing the California D.R.E.A.M Act from pass-ing. ”
Francisco Castillo, 
Schwarzenegger’s press secretary, said the governor supported the AB 540 bill that allowed undocument-
ed students to pay in-state tuition, but not the D.R.E.A.M. Act, which he vetoed in both 2005 and 2008.
At the time of the veto, 
Schwarzenegger said it would be irre-sponsible to offer further aid to undoc-umented students when the university is already raising student fees just to maintain the quality of education.
Castillo added that, should the act 
be passed, fewer funds would have to be distributed among a larger pool of applicants, which Schwarzenegger sees as penalizing legal students who require assistance.
“[Schwarzenegger] believes [illegal 
immigrants] should no t be penalized 
for the acts of their parents, but the act would penalize students who are here legally by reducing the financial aid available to them, ” Castillo said. 
The UC Board of Regents meet-
ing last month — held at UC San Francisco from March 23 to March 25 — was also the site of protests by 
affirmative-action supporters By Any Means Necessary. They convened to pressure the board to adopt a D.R.E.A.M. scholarship program for immigrant students.
Yvette Felarca, the Northern 
California coordinator for BAMN, said she was disappointed with the lack of D.R.E.A.M. discussion at the meeting. She said there were approxi-mately 50 students present on March 24, coming from nearly all the UC campuses. 
“The main discussion about the 
D.R.E.A.M. scholarship happened on Tuesday, and it was very disturbing what they didn’t say, ” Felarca said. “The regents made it loud and clear that they are not interested in abol-ishing the segregation of UC cam-puses — a segregation that leads to a hostile climate and means that there is no true public higher education. ” 
Vice President of External Affairs-
elect Michael Lam said that although he could not comment on the D.R.E.A.M. Act at this time, he plans to meet with West before determin-ing what actions he should take upon entering office.
Various versions of the bill have 
been proposed since 2001. In 2005, Senator Gilbert Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) proposed a similar bill called SB 60, which Schwarzenegger vetoed. He then authored a different version, SB 1301, which was intro-duced in February 2008. It passed through state Assembly and Senate, where it passed 46 to 29; however, it was then vetoed by Schwarzenegger on Sept. 30. The newest version, SB 1460, was introduced Feb. 19 of this year, and is currently being discussed in a Senate committee. 
If passed, eligible students must 
fulfill the requirements of the AB 540 bill. Students must be currently enrolled at an accredited institution of higher education in California and must file an affidavit stating that they will apply for legal residency as soon as possible.

Every year, Indio, Calif., sees a massive 
spike in population. Tens of thousands 
of concert enthusiasts flood the city for the West Coast’s biggest, baddest musical attraction: the one-and-only Coachella. 
I’ve always managed to dodge 
Coachella due to lack of funds, but this year, a friend of mine found a loophole for all those on a holy-shit-it’s-$300 budget: the volunteer option. In exchange for 18 hours of slavery, volunteers receive free festival entry and complimentary camping. Considering most acts didn’t start their sets until 12 p.m. (and the rave didn’t start until 4 p.m.), it was a pretty sweet deal.
Due to a two-hour delay at volunteer 
check-in, we were fortunate: no Friday shift. If fortunate means having to show up (sober, ideally) at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday.
When 6:30 a.m. rolled around, we 
each took cold showers and brushed our teeth from water bottles — all except one friend. who accidentally grabbed a vodka bottle, a la Ke$ha . This was confirmed 
by a very un-Ke$ha “What the fuck!” At check-in, we were informed that we were on trash duty. Karma, apparently, for all those bottles I tossed and trampled during Passion Pit’s show the night before.
Fortunately, the job was mostly 
monotonous and straightforward. (By the way, if you went to Coachella and are missing a pair of underwear, we found it — along with 10 others.)
I was beginning to resemble Oscar the 
Grouch by the time our supervisors relo-cated us. We were whisked down a dusty road in a golf cart, kicked out and made to hold up “Venue is this way” signs. Suck on this, Vanna White.
One hour before freedom, a guy ran 
up to us in panic. He’ d left his sunscreen bottle on the bus and wanted it back. We informed him that we couldn’t get it, but offered ours instead. Turns out “sun-screen” was code for “well-disguised alco-hol” that he was trying to sneak in. For the next hour, we watched in amusement as he boarded every bus and searched beneath the seats. I can only hope the sce-
nario ended in some whitey trying to pre-vent skin cancer with  a handful of Patron.
On Sunday, we were told we’ d be on 
ticketing duty. I was charged with the task of snapping wristbands onto ticket-holders after they were scanned by Aaron — the Batman to my Robin.
Just when the shift was starting to put 
me to sleep, there was a deafening clang and thud as one wayward rebel tried to jump the fence behind Aaron, and instead ate a face full  of dust. Not to be deterred, 
he peeled himself up and made for the gates amid cries of “Security!” Admirably, he actually made it in for a second — before being tackled and thrown back into the dirt. (This time, on the outside.)
More cautious schemers got creative to 
swindle their way into the festival.  One girl 
came up, bawling that her ticket had been stolen when she’ d been drugged and drunk — only to change her story when she spoke to someone else. One pair arrived 
dressed as a Chinese dragon, announcing 
that they were the Coachella dragon and needed to be let in. After being denied entry — looking as scandalized as a plastic dragon mask can look —  the costume was 
found abandoned next to a pile of trash. 
Of course, there were perks to offset 
the craziness — volunteers were gifted all confiscated items, including beer. We were fed sandwiches, and the staff was pretty 
lenient: I even had the chance to sneak off 
to see MUTEMATH during one of my shifts. Not so bad, considering everyone else who got in free was escorted out by police, sporting a host of battle wounds.Working

It’s a gutsy move to direct 
a play centered on some of the same racial issues 
that rocked the campus last quarter — but freshman Master of Fine Arts stu-dent Larissa Lury just went there. Based on a script by 
junior playwright Ronald 
McCants, “Oyster” follows a black man’s struggle to reconnect with the son he abandoned long ago. Like so, Lury examines the black experience in America through the lens of one father-son relationship. Commenting on every-
thing from poverty and personal loss to the military, child abandonment, aca-demic elitism, racism, affir-mative action and fraternity hazing, it would seem that McCants bit off more than he could chew. But with two of the most talented actors 
in the MFA program to 
carry the script, nearly every piece of its ambitious puzzle falls effortlessly into place.
At the outset, we meet

Muirstock 2010 takes your deleted account centerstage.   By Matthew Pecot
It’s been years since you moved 
on to Facebook, but Sherwood’s still playing puppy-love pop like 
you never got rid of your MySpace.
Considering the band’s third 
album, QU, is dominated by lead 
singer Nate Henry’s sickly croon, it’s surprisingly mellow — only causing truly unbearable nausea when he prods at the choruses. The biggest perk is that lyrics like “Now I’ve been making eyes at you all night/ Trying to decide what’s on your mind” might ease your transition from high school to Tioga Hall.
Hailing from San Luis Obispo, 
the band’s niche lies between mid-Cal chill and Freudian repression. The Sherwood signature consists of plinky soft-rock verses with zero-distortion guitars, strumming so unobtrusively that it’s a shock when tracks like “Y ou Are” break out a choppy rhythm reminiscent of the Jonas Brothers. 
Sherwood does occasionally 
amp it up for a stadium singalong — get ready to put your hands in the air — but they’re mainly mas-ters of the awkward sway.
SHERWOOD
Give Vampire Weekend a beach and a beer, and you’ve got this LA college-rock happy place. 
Every chorus is harmonized, and every guitar’s reverb cranked to 11 — and though the California chill smooths out the best of the VW bounce, the Smiles are still the most danceable dudes here. Forget you’re stuck on campus and slow-spin to a sunny bass.
THE SMILES
 HE IS WEThey might do pretty indie a la She & Him, but unsigned He Is We is more hi-fi studio 
production than pillow talk.
More than a little multi-tracking 
of singer Rachel Taylor’s soft and soaring vocals pluck He Is We far out of the bedroom genre. Y ou’ d think instrumentalist Trevor Kelly was being charged for every note, considering the way he hardly touches his acoustic six-string and piano during a verse — then splurg-es on a soft-strummed chorus. 
However treated, Taylor’s voice 
takes the lead, hopscotching the octave to pump the duo’s broken-hearted lullabies with some star power. Listen for standout head-bobber “ A Mess It Grows. ” It’ll be a welcome romp on the swing set after a traumatic round of midterms.
THE
RICHARDTATERFUNKESTRAFatally hip student band 
Funkestra may or may not be happy to see you, 
but somehow they’ve hidden an entire horn section in their pants — and they’re not afraid to whip it out every Thursday at Porter’s Pub. This goofball outfit plays call-and-response numbers with stanky vocals, but their specialty is losing themselves in freak-out jazz jams. In fact, the only thing that keeps the funksters grounded is cymbal-happy drum god Burleigh Drummond — but still, only Michael J. Fox and your weird aunt could dance naturally to these polyrhythms, so show up adequately addled to float with one seriously lethal form of funk.

Lou Rhodes
One Good Thing
MOTION AUDIO
Former lead singer of 
Manchester-based drum ‘n’ bass band 
Lamb, Lou Rhodes has a set of British pipes that’s both nuanced and easy on the ears — but it’s not nearly enough to set her apart from the Kate Nashes of the world.
After gathering a 
small following with emotionally charged ’90s hit “The Rain” — not to mention a spot on the hit “Moulin Rouge” soundtrack — her third album falls flat, starved of Lamb’s lush sonic tex-tures and blasting further into blandville with every (slightly tweaked) take on moody acoustics.
Rhodes’ whisper does 
burst with sincerity on the titular track, but her emotion is unrealistically directed at a vague end-of-the-world scenario, rendered even more underwhelming by a stock-chord backdrop.
Rhodes bleeds emo 
tree-sap tears on album highlight “Bloom, ” relay-ing her desire to bloom with flowers that lift their heads toward the sun. It begins as the most understated stuff on the album — five strings are plucked on loop — but a more intriguing parade of players slowly enters the room: A tin-kling arpeggio drops at random intervals while swelling strings and sing-ers combine for dramatic crescendo. All the while, Rhodes remains plain and sweet, refusing to either drown out or fall in line with her under-layers. The complex harmony showcases her goods more than any sparse acoustic tune: Rhodes’ voice may be forgettable on its own, but give it a busy enough backdrop and its pure simplicity begins to shine through.

10ALBUMREVIEWS
Coheed & Cambria
Year of the Black Rainbow
COLUMBIA
If you were at the 2008 
Sun God Festival, you may remember those 
guys with the crazy hair who destroyed the main stage after Sean Kingston spent an hour waddling around like an obese apocalypse. Coheed and Cambria were electric then, and have only gotten better — as demonstrated on new LP Year of the  Black Rainbow .
Longtime fans know 
that each of their albums is part of a conceptual story masterminded by lead singer and guitarist Claudio Sanchez; Rainbow  
serves as the prequel. While stepping back in the storyline, the album takes a step outside the band’s former talent bracket — while never losing touch with its roots. 
They’re able to deliver 
their emotive power with more elegance than ever before, taking all the awkwardness out of their signature genre jumps. On lead single “Here We Are Juggernaut, ” the band delves for the first time into industrial prog-rock, clanking drums like pistons and overlaying ground guitars with all the grimy charm of 1800s London. And just when Sanchez’ bombastic pro-duction is about to get overwhelming, drummer Chris Pennie always takes the beat back to basic.
Most of the time, 
though, Sanchez’s grand-stand is appropriate and powerful: “This Shattered Symphony” is the album’s pinnacle, evolving the post-hardcore origins of the band into a modern experiment. Sanchez throws down a punchy guitar riff to accompany an orchestral lead, equally wishy-washy on the mic between a high-pitched croon and vicious growl. 
Halfway through its 
vigorous run, however, Rainbow  does begin to feel 
ponderous and overdone; some tracks are virtual photocopies of the first six. The latter-half exception is the softhearted “Pearl of the Stars, ” on which indus-trial drums grind gently behind a delicate guitar line as Sanchez reflects on a girl he calls his “angel from the west, the pearl of the stars. ” 
Powerful, ambitious 
and melodramatic as ever, Coheed and Cambria won’t win any new fans with Rainbow  — but it’ll 
impress the hell out of the diehards.

Kate Nash
My Best Friend Is You
FICTION
While she never aban-
dons her trademark folk-rock sensibili-
ties from debut Made of Bricks , Kate Nash whips 
out a brand-new cache psychedelic embellish-ments  for sophomore 
effort My Best Friend Is 
You — venturing onto 
refreshingly adult frontiers without compromising her melodic kiddie-pop core.
Nash’s Cockney accent 
is a daring shell for her trained octaves, alternat-ing between sweet, sassy and snarling amid the most impressive range her side of the Atlantic. The further she strides from the safe, label-padded Bricks , the foxier the riot-
ous modern-Motown sound.
Nash has mastered tra-
ditional 1960s pop with a punch and a wink: “Doo-Wah-Doo” overlays 12-bar Buddy Holly blues instru-mentation with a verbal catfight, doing what the Beach Boys could never do by ending on the line, “She’s a bitch!” 
But the album’s rar-
est gems are a handful of slithering, sub-punk numbers on which Nash transforms from podunk beauty queen to snarling, irreverent rock star in the big city. “Mansion Song” is the best of her party in the UK, driven by power-ful jungle drums and a chorus of multi-octaved Nashes chanting “I am a misfit” over a stadium-worthy guitar line. This point of pride, of course, is only realized after one-and-a-half minutes of profane lambasting of “21st-century girls who can get fucked just as well as a man. ” Then there’s the fact that — in a stroke of either genius or cheap identity crisis — that same riot-grrrl rant is underscored by a lo-fi, static-crackled solo from a seasoned opera singer.
Best Friend is sure to 
divide the crowd: More conventional (read: bor-ing) tracks like “Paris” and “Early Christmas Present” will please older fans, but it’ll take a much more open mind to appreciate the outlandish scrapbook of honks and genres she takes up as a side hobby. It’s quite a cliff-jump from Bricks ’ clean folk-rock to 
the heroin grind of “I Just Love Y ou More” — on which Nash emits a series of Banshee screams that would put Y oko Ono to shame in an ear-piercing contest.

TRACKREVIEW
‘The Arrangement’
Beach House
SUB POP
As dream-pop slowly takes over the airwaves, it’s hard to find a group that 
doesn’t overdose on breathy, introspective poetry. But Maryland duo Beach House, though not completely avoiding the plague, does it with humility: 
Somewhere in their wistful vocal pastorale and softly plucked melodies, the genre’s obligatory otherworldliness becomes more existential than extraterrestrial. A heavy B-side off their upcoming Zebra EP, “The Arrangement” sets up duets like “Do you say what you mean?/ Y ou are only sixteen” inside a warm, earthly atmosphere, proving they can lure in any sucker with an ounce of feeling — not just the lovesick indie crowd.                                —Neelaab Nasraty

$650! *Phantom Band” is the story of a 
group of Santa Cruz high-school misfits who meet up once a week 
for band practice — and, of course, to together overcome the challenges of the almighty growing pain. When a mysterious mute violinist joins the group, though, everything gets turned upside down, forcing the kids to re-examine their relationship with the world around them. 
Should make for a winning 
rehash of “The Breakfast Club” and “Glee, ” right? Unfortunately, it’s more a hasty summa-ry of both. The gang’s all here: the brain, the princess, the basket case, the criminal and the leader of the pack: a beautiful overachiever with a stick up her ass. And sophomore Master of Fine Arts playwright Krista Knight’s characters hardly evolve at all over the course of the play, leaving us unsure of what Knight was so afraid of. We only get insight into main character Deto’s past, and — though 
well-acted — even that storyline is far from groundbreak-ing. Sorry, Deter, but John Bender had an alcoholic parent, too.
After all that, 
“Band” peeters out with a disappoint-ing conclusion we 
could see coming from a mile away. In fact, the only part of the play that doesn’t make for complete deja vu is its parting “message” — a tacked-on lesson about the music of life being a combination of the good times and the bad. And even that feels force-fed, for obvious reasons. 
The vast majority of these down-
falls can be attributed to a lackluster script. The actors, on the other hand, are charming, and the set is a work of art: A giant suspended tree branch simulates the forest, and the lighting fluctuates perfectly with the tone of the dialogue. But with a theme this uninspired, the whole presentation is pretty much doomed. Unless you’re game for a particularly snoozeworthy sermon on coming of age in America, skip this unnecessary flashback to the horrors of high school.Anthony (Gabriel Lawrence) — a 15-year-old football hopeful whose only experience is breaking his arm before the first game — and Tony (Bowman Wright), Anthony’s deadbeat dad, who desperately wants to re-enter his son’s life. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of generational bickering; lucky for us, the colossal argument is written in thought-provoking sociological prow-ess, with a healthy side of tongue-in-cheek humor to make the serious shit go down.
With a minimalist set that your three-
year-old sister could assemble — stacked cardboard boxes and stretched white gar-bage bags — Lawrence and Wright must do all the heavy lifting; and you better believe they deliver. Whether getting low to the Jackson 5’s “Shake Y our Body (Down to the Ground), ” heart-to-hearting about drug abuse or combating what Anthony calls “the black predisposition to failure, ” both actors give it all they’ve got.
The ambitious “Oyster” is not without its 
rough patches. One disjointed scene watches a game of beer pong between Anthony and his Dartmouth frat brother Jeff (Mark Christine) turn into a nauseating show of bigotry, as Anthony is forced to perform the Sambo song. It’s certainly relevant, but feels pasted into an otherwise cohesive piece — an obvious cater to the college crowd. Even worse are a handful of pop-culture referenc-es — “awkward turtle, ” Lindsay Lohan, etc. — that stick out like cheap buzzwords in an otherwise intimate father-son conversation.
Hats go off to Christine for playing three 
characters, but he never leaves the shadow of his multifaceted co-stars. As the token white guy with a limited world view, he serves as a foil to the drama. Unfortunately, this also means that it’s his job to rake in the cheap laughs — with every hillbilly scratch of his potbelly. Overall, though, “Oyster” is an introspective escape from ignorance that will no doubt serve as a prompt for intelligent discussion long after the shock value off UCSD’s February show-down has dissipated.

SPORTS THURSDAY , APRIL 22, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 
USC error handed UCSD the set 30-26.
However, USC quickly turned things 
around, raising the intensity by dominating the 
second set 30-21. They continued their beat down into the third, out-hitting the Tritons .484 to .175 and winning the third set 30-23.
In the fourth set, UCSD took an early 11-4 
lead, staving off an attempted USC comeback that did end up narrowing UCSD’s lead to a mere two points. However, The Tritons clinched it 30-26 in the end.
A decisive fifth set typified the back-and-
forth nature of the match overall. A small 8-7 Trojan lead was quickly reversed — courtesy of a 3-1 Triton run — giving UCSD the lead. However, tied again at 16-16, a UCSD attack-ing error gifted USC the set 18-16, along with the match.
 “We were disappointed in the match, ” head 
coach Kevin Ring said. “We weren’t disap-pointed in our level of play, but the result. We worked hard and got off to a pretty good start. We played competitively and we played well in the match. ”
After the close defeat to USC, the Tritons 
returned to face Pepperdine on Saturday at RIMAC Arena for their season-ending Senior Night celebration. For their final match, the Tritons came through to upset No. 3 Pepperdine 28-30, 30-27, 29-30, 30-27 and 15-12.
The first set was closely fought between 
both teams — evidenced by 19 ties in the set. Eventually, though, Pepperdine claimed the set at 30-28.
The Tritons started off the second set trail-
ing 11-6, but fought back for a 14-14 tie. After taking a 20-17 lead, UCSD repelled Pepperdine’s attempts to even the set, holding on for a 30-27 win. The contest was tied at one set per team.
Quick to respond, the Waves took control 
of the third set. They claimed it at a sizable 30-19.
The fourth set was much far more dif-
ficult for both teams, and the lead fluctuated between the two. However, with the score tied at 21  points apiece, UCSD made a strong 9-6 run to take the set at 30-27, forcing a fifth set.
Fritsch played a vital role in the Tritons’ 
eventual victory, sending down five kills in the fifth set. UCSD maintained the lead through-out, and Pepperdine was only ever able to narrow UCSD’s lead to two points. After a kill from Joel Davidson, the Tritons took the set 
15-12 for the match win.
“Winning Game Two was the key, ” Ring 
said. “It can be the decider sometimes in matches. Through the match, we kept fighting and we sent it to Game Five. ”
In addition to being a nice going-away 
present, the victory was also a monumental showcase in terms of individual accomplish-ments for the Triton seniors. Fritsch ended the night with 25 kills on .455 hitting, mak-ing him second on the UCSD career-kills list with 1,403 kills. Spangler added 14 kills in the match and finished with a total of 1,491 career-kills at UCSD — which makes him the school’s all-time career-kills leader.
The Tritons finished with a record of 11-19 
this season, and 6-16 against Mountain Pacific Sports Federation teams. Although they did not reach the MPSF playoffs, Ring said he was encouraged by the improvement the Tritons showed throughout the season.
“ T h e  t e a m  h a s  i m p r o v e d  t h r o u g h o u t  t h e  
season, as well as in my five seasons here, ” Ring said. “For next season, our goal is to try to get to MPSF playoffs. ”

Already holding the school record in the 800-
meter race, Senior Daniel Anderson ran the 400-
meter this week in 48.91 seconds — the seventh best time in Triton history. Senior Leon Baham also dominated the 400-meter hurdles, winning by nearly two seconds.
In the UCSD Triton Invitational on April 23, 
the Tritons will compete against top-notch talent from across the country — including athletes from Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and other UC campuses. The Tritons will also host the CCAA Championships two weeks later on May 6.
“The Triton invite looks to be a really exciting 
meet, just looking at the caliber of athletes that are coming, ” Ahner said. ”We’ve got a week off to get rested up and ready to go, and then we’re at home again — so we really could not ask for a better situation. ”

“We dropped a tough game on Thursday, ” 
junior third baseman Evan Kehoe said. “Tim 
Shibuya threw really well, but our offense didn’t pick him up with any run support. We made some adjustments after that game and ended up winning the next three games. ”
In the second game, the Tritons seemed 
destined for a 0-2 hole in the series, entering the seventh inning four runs down. However, the Triton offense suddenly came alive in the seventh, turning in eight runs throughout the inning — forcing the Golden Eagles to make four pitching changes. 
The first six Tritons up to bat in the inning 
all reached base. Junior outfielder Kyle Saul gave the Tritons the lead with a three-run RBI triple. Senior starting pitcher Matt Rossman also had a solid outing on Friday: He tossed 6.1 innings of three-run ball. UCSD tacked on two more runs in the eighth inning for a 10-4 win. 
On Saturday and Sunday, the Tritons trav-
eled to Reeder Field for the final two games of the series on Saturday and Sunday. Game Three was a spectacle of Triton offensive talent: The team posted six runs in the fifth inning, punctuated by a grand slam from Kehoe — his sixth home run of the season. Junior outfielders Aaron Bauman and Saul also homered in the game.
Senior starting pitcher Kirby St. John 
allowed only three Golden Eagle runs on 14 hits to notch the victory as UCSD went on to win the game at a score of 13-6. 
Trailing 4-1 into the sixth inning of the 
series’ final game, UCSD’s victory hinged on another unlikely comeback. Junior righty Guido Knudson had an uncharacteristic out-ing on Sunday, lasting only four and two-thirds innings and allowing four runs; how-ever, the Tritons jumped back into the ring when senior second baseman Blake Tagmeyer drew a leadoff walk. Senior catcher Kellen Lee followed with a clutch two-run homer to left field, pulling UCSD within one run at 4-3. 
Sophomore outfielder Danny Susdorf 
came off the bench as a pinch hitter, doubled, and then advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by junior infielder Grant Bauer. With a man in scoring position, senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich stepped up to the plate with two outs and knocked in the tying run. Tied 4-4, Saul drove in the game-winning run with a hit up the middle. 
Senior reliever Daniel Simmons also came 
up huge, shutting the Golden Eagles down for two and one-third innings. He allowed just one hit in relief. 
“ All weekend, we found ourselves behind 
late in the games, ” Lee said. “Things weren’t going our way for the most part. Usually teams get caught in the fact that they are los-ing, but we remained calm and didn’t worry about the score during the game. That keeps us focused and able to perform and comeback — that was the key for us this weekend. ” 
With the series win, UCSD improved 
to 37-6 overall and 27-5 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association. The Tritons will now head into a crucial series with No. 10 Cal State Dominguez Hills — who stand at 34-11 overall and 24-8 in CCAA play — start-ing April 25. The series will be a battle for No. 1, as the Toros trail the Tritons by three games in the conference.

BASEBALL — When they dropped 
the first leg of their four-game series 
against Cal State Los Angeles at Triton 
Ballpark on April 15, the No. 3 Tritons 
found themselves in unfamiliar terri-tory. However, the team bounced back on April 16 with a come-from-behind 10-4 win, and proceeded to take the next two at Reeder Field by scores of 13-6 and 5-4 on April 17. By the end of the road trip, they had improved their away record to 13-1.

TRACK & FIELD — With the UCSD Triton 
Invitational slated for next weekend — a meet that attracts an elite, international field of teams — the Triton track-and-field team did some fine-tuning at the Soka Peace Invitational on April 17 to prepare for the season’s home stretch. 
UCSD had a phenomenal week on the track: 
Seven individual athletes recorded times ranking among the 10 best in UCSD history. The Tritons also broke several stadium records, including a run by junior Kelly Fogarty that bested the mark of current U.S. Olympian Carmelita Jeter.
“In the last two or three weeks, I really feel we’ve 
put all the pieces in place to head into our conference championships, ” women’s coach Darcy Ahner said. “On both sides — men and women — we’re really 
ready, and I think the team feels it too. The momen-
tum is there, and it’ll be a lot of fun. ”
Earlier in the week, on April 15, senior Linda 
Rainwater set a new school record in the heptathlon at the Mt. SAC/California Invitational heptathlon.  Rainwater, who is the 2008 Division-II national champion in the event, topped her previous record of 5,303 points with a fifth-place finish of 5,333 points. Junior Stephanie LeFever also competed in the event, tallying a personal best of 5,193 points. Rainwater posted another school record of 5’ 
10.5” in the high jump at the heptathlon. The mark fell just one-fourth of an inch below the per-sonal best of Coach Ahner, who is a former Western Athletic Conference athlete of the year.
“I told her she has six inches to go, since she’s six 
inches taller than me, ” Ahner said. “But I’m just jok-ing about that. She’s just a few points short of my best score in the heptathlon, too, and she’s going to bust right through both of those marks and go right past me. It’s really fun to see that. ”
At the Soka meet, Fogarty and senior Christine 
Merrill blasted past their competition in the 100-meter dash: Fogarty finished first in 11.75 seconds and Merrill took second at 11.94 seconds. Fogarty’s time broke the stadium record set by U.S. Olympian Jeter, the world’s second fastest woman ever in race. The mark made Merrill a NCAA Division-II provi-sional qualifier — meaning she could be qualified 
for as many as seven events at the NCAA Division-II Championships, just over a month away.
Senior Leah Murphy was another Triton head-
liner, comfortably winning the long jump with a mark of 19’ 1.25” . The jump was the third farthest in UCSD history, and a NCAA Provisional Qualifier. Sophomore Caitlin Meagher took her first foray into the Triton record books with a time of 14.79 in the

UCSD closed out a rollercoaster 2010 season with a string of tough home matches last week against steep competition. 
The final run began against the nation-ally top-ranked team Cal Baptist on April 14, then continued versus conference foes University of Southern California and Pepperdine University on April 16 and April 17, respectively. 
Despite a difficult slate of opponents, 
the Tritons managed to send their seniors off on a high note. The match against Cal Baptist ended 25-30, 30-14, 30-28 and 30-26 in the Tritons’ favor, marking UCSD’s first win over the Lancers since 2005 and bumping UCSD’s record against Cal Baptist up to 4-11.
The first set started in favor of UCSD, 
until a late rally by the Lancers gave them the set 30-25.
The Tritons made amends for their first-
set slip-up by dominating in the second. They took a quick 11-3 lead and allowed one attack error throughout the rest of the set, breezing through to a 30-14 victory.
The teams fought equally hard in the 
third set, tying the score six times and taking multiple turns as leaders. The last tie occurred at 28-28, right before Frank Fritsch and Calvin Ross created a set point for the Tritons. Fritsch’s kill sealed the set 30-28 for UCSD.
UCSD grabbed an early lead in the 
fourth set to finish the match quickly and cleanly. However, Cal Baptist retaliated late in the set by narrowing the score to 28-26, though UCSD still clutched the lead. Fortunately for the Tritons, Ross and Carl Eberts collaborated for a block and a kill, respectively, to give the team some leverage. Jason Spangler closed out the set 30-26 with a game-winning kill
Overall, the Tritons bettered the Lancers 
in the match, hitting a .304 average to Cal Baptist’s .218. In the second set alone, UCSD hit at a .706 average.
After a day of rest, the Tritons were back 
in action Friday at RIMAC Arena against USC. It was a close match, but the Trojans outlasted the Tritons in the fifth set for a 26-30, 30-21, 30-23, 26-30 18-16 match victory.
UCSD took the lead in the first set until 
USC came back to tie the set 13-13. There were eight more ties in the set — the last at 23-23 — before the Tritons took the lead on a Fritsch kill. A kill from Spangler and a
