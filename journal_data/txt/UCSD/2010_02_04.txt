The fate of student shuttle and bus services 
is still uncertain, after the A.S. Council post-
poned a decision last night on whether to run the Transportation Referendum on the Spring Quarter election ballot. 
If placed on the ballot and passed by the stu-
dent body, the referendum would instate a fee of $25 per-undergraduate per-quarter to maintain UCSD’s free public-transportation services. 
In the absence of these funds, popular lines like 
the Nobel and Arriba shuttles — along with a hand-ful of MTS routes — would be cut by 50 percent, according to UCSD Parking and Transportation Services Director Brian d’ Autremont. The council’s vote to postpone the issue came 
in light of a resolution by the committee that draft-ed the referendum: Committee members urged the council to reject the fee increase. 
According to Transfer Senator Adam Powers, 
a member of the committee, the reasoning behind the recommendation was that there simply isn’t sufficient need to pass the referendum. 
“It’s not that we disapprove of 
the language, it’s that we’re opposed to the need to run a referendum, ” he said. “We did not feel it was proper for us to be placed with this burden without looking properly into alter-native shuttle funding. ” 
Many members of the A.S. 
Council — including Campuswide Senator Adam Kenworthy — said they believe the Parking and Transportation Department is using scare tactics to win student fees, and that there is little chance of public transit options being shut down.
“I don’t think the buses would actually ever 
stop running, ” Kenworthy said. “I don’t think the chancellor would let that happen, because you can’t have a public university without a convenient means of going to campus. ”
Kenworthy said he also believes the proposal 
is dangerous because it would set a precedent for A.S. Council to raise student fees to help fund any department in need. 
“Transportation is a department on campus, 
and this [would] be the first referendum that does not directly benefit students, and is outside the realm of student affairs, ” he said. 
Powers agreed about the possible disadvan-
tages of passing such a referendum. 
“We’re worried that this could create something 
more — for example, Student Health Services is in the red as well, ” he said. “We don’t want to take the shuttles hostage, but according to our research, there is more that can be done before the students need to reach into their pockets. ”

d’ Autremont said that student referendums are By Ayelet Bitton

Google awarded three researchers 
from the UCSD computer science and engineering department a $100,000 grant on Feb. 2 to fund their work in energy efficient computing.
Professors of computer science and 
engineering Tajana Rosing, Steven Swanson and Amin Vahdat have been working to find ways to reduce the amount of energy large computer systems use.
“Right now, if you look at servers, 
when you turn it on, it consumes a lot of energy, ” Rosing said. “Whether you run a lot of programs on it or you run very little on it, it consumes nearly the same amount of energy. That’s kind of problematic if you’re trying to save money and the amount of electricity being used. ”
In order to reduce the amount of 
energy being used by such computer setups, the team is working to design a system that will take in an amount of energy proportional to the amount required by the system.
“What we’re trying to do, effectively, 
is to create systems that will be much more proportional in terms of how much they run, ” Rosing said. “The more they run, the more things they get done [and] the more energy they consume. ”
The research is targeted toward 
systems such as the massive computers that run Google Search or Google Maps.
“In the long run, if we are successful, 
we will be able to show huge savings in terms of energy costs, and therefore by proxy in terms of reduction in greenhouse emissions, ” Rosing said.
In previous research, the team 
has already found way to reduce the energy used by systems with respect to bandwidth, system cooling and memory.
Vahdat said they hope their 
findings in their field will contribute to sustainability efforts.
“Energy efficiency is important 
across a number of different industries, ” Vahdat said. “It’s being recognized that information technology is an increasing consumer of energy. It’s an exciting time to be working in this space because you can have a real impact on the energy that’s being consumed. ”

Of all the causes students may be asked to fund 
this election season, the Loft  — Price Center East’s 
arts and music venue — is no longer one of them. The A.S. Council voted not to place a $4.47 stu-
dent-fee increase on the Spring Quarter election ballot.
At first vote the referendum 
failed 16-10, then failed again 14-10-1 at revote. 
The council initially voted 
during Week Three to approve a version of the Loft Referendum that instituted a fee of $3.82 per quarter for all students. After the Graduate Student Association voted Jan. 25 not to approve 
the referendum, the council revised the draft to an

While on the hunt for the gene 
responsible for ciliopathies — diseases 
caused by cellular malfunctions in organelles that affect kidney, liver, or nerve functions — UCSD researchers instead discovered a cellular cause of early onset blindness.
This discovery could help in the 
diagnosis and treatment of children who would otherwise begin to lose their vision at an early age.
The search began in Fall 2004, 
when scientists were researching Joubert Syndrome — a ciliopathic brain disorder that affects children. The disease can cause mental retarda-tion, a loss of balance, the growth of extra fingers or toes and, occasionally, retinal blindness. 
To study the causes behind Joubert 
Syndrome, scientists looked to a gene called “ Abelson helper integration site-1, ” or AHI1, that had previously been linked to ciliopathies.
According to graduate student 
Carrie M. Louie, who led the research project, scientists began the study by removing AHI1 in mice to see if its absence would cause problems in brain development resem-bling those caused by Joubert Syndrome.
“We try to link the 
genes in the body to their function, what they’re doing and what kind of diseases they can cause when the function is blocked, ” Joseph Gleeson, associate professor of neuroscience and the project’s faculty supervisor, said.
Louie found that the mice did not 
have the same brain development problems present in those suffering from Joubert Syndrome. However, a closer examination showed that the mice were completely blind. 
Without AHI1, photoreceptors — 
also known as rods and cones — are obstructed by photopigments that build up to toxic levels in the eye and preventing normal vision.
After working with mice, the 
researchers wanted to see whether the absence of the gene was contribut-ing to other diseases where blindness is a symptom.
“We generated a mouse model to 
study the gene functions and we dis-covered that the mouse had severe blindness, ” Louie said. “We studied this further, and we wanted to see whether [the absence of AHI1] causes blindness in human patients with diseases other than Joubert syndrome. ”
They screened a group of 
European patients with cystic kidney disease — a ciliopathy that has prop-
erties similar to Joubert Syndrome 
— and found that 
those lacking 
AHI1 were more 
likely to go blind.
With this 
knowledge, new 
therapies and ways of 
screening early onset blindness are now possible.
This discovery will help develop 
of new drugs and improve tech-niques for diagnosing retinal dis-eases, which affect 5 to 10 percent of the population. Scientists will also be better equipped to tackle other ciliopathies, such as obesity, mental impairment, and liver fibrosis.
“We built the foundation for new 
leads to gene therapy, ” Louie said. “It’s a step toward helping people fig-ure out what your genes are doing. ”

graduate funding. 
According to AVP Academic Affairs 
Jordan Taylor, the biggest change was 
that graduate students would pay gen-eral-entrance fees for Loft events. 
Campuswide Senator Katie Hall 
said both the initial rejection and the motion to reconsider was due to the lack of voting members at the meeting. 
“It’s midterms week, and not every-
one is here who was here before, and I want everyone to have a chance to vote on this issue, ” she said. 
The Loft Referendum has met 
roadblocks before: It went before the council in the 2008-09 academic year, but was rejected. It was proposed again during Fall Quarter 2009, but postponed until Week Three.
The second referendum discussed 
concerned athletic facilities.
According to Don Chadwick, direc-
tor of sports facilities at UCSD, the ref-erendum proposes to both renew the original $12 Canyonview fee — which is set to expire in 2013, —and increase it to $22 to account for inflation. He said the $1.3 million potentially gener-ated by the fees would cover the $1.295 million in operating costs.
Although there are three years until the fee expires, Chadwick said it was important to address the matter early. 
“We’ d like to address it before it 
becomes critical, and before the situ-ation becomes do-or-die, ” he said. “If it fails we need time to take action and continue discussion. ”
The council will discuss two other 
referendums next week: the volun-tary fee to create a subsection of A.S. Council separate from the university, and a proposal to increase student fees to fund Price Center.

dance routines, gospel music, and more! 
General admission is free. Complimentary 
dessert included with purchase of full entree. *

* Lunch prices vary.  Visa and MasterCard accepted.After two important referenda discussions, three impeach-ments on the table, and eight 
hours after the beginning of debate, the A.S. Council left the fourth floor forum in Price Center East at almost 3 a.m. 
During the meeting’s public 
input session, Marshall Chair Tanvir Dhillon  announced the new Marshall 
A.S. senator Junn Paulino, who was a member of council two years ago as AVP Diversity Affairs.
A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta said 
UC President Mark Yudof finally 
answered Gupta’s email regarding bringing the UC Regents meeting to UCSD “two months after the fact, but decided to refer me to someone else. ”
VP Student Life Ricsie Hernandez  
reminded council of the A.S. Meet and Greet free barbeque event on Library Walk next Friday as an opportunity for “you all to meet your constituents. ”
Councilmembers hashed out 
details of specific language of the Loft and transportation referenda for eight hours.
UCAB Chair and AVP Academic 
Affairs Jordan Taylor  presented coun-
cilmembers with the revised draft of the Loft referendum, which the Graduate Student Association rejected on Jan. 25. 
After a long discussion about the 
referendum language, councilmem-bers failed the Loft referendum 16-10.
Taylor kept his cool, but asked 
that everyone who voted no on the language of the referendum speak to him immediately. After a break, Taylor asked the council to reconsider their votes, but was denied by Speaker  
James Lintern. 
A special presentation by Athletic Director Don Chadwick broke some 
of the tension in the room. Chadwick gave a history about the recreational facilities on campus, and the funds generated by them. Chadwick is pro-posing a $22 student fee to maintain the facilities after the funds expire in 2013.
A.S. members of the 
Transportation Committee and Brian 
d’ Autremont , 
Director of Parking and Transportation gave presenta-tions regarding the transportation referendum.
The issue of  MTS student bus 
stickers being subsidized, blue and white UCSD shuttles being eliminated and parking structures were debated.
The council finally agreed to table 
the motion until next week after another revision of the legislation to clear up language.
Advocate General Parminder 
Sandhu  brought back the resolu-
tion of councilmembers’ impeach-ments. After a debate over whether the council can excuse retroactive absences, Biological Sciences senator John Erhardt was impeached from his position with a vote of 12-4. His impeachment will go before the A.S. Judicial Board, which will make the final decision. 
Sixth College Senator Kevin 
Nguyen ’s resolution for impeach-
ment was tabled indefinitely and the Campus Affairs committee excused Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena.
Councilmembers next debated 
over whether to move the motion to reconsider the Loft referendum into New Business. After a 14-10-1 vote, the council did not move to recon-sider the Loft in New Business and the resolution failed.+W]VKQT1UXMIKPM[;MVI\WZ

Businessused to fund transportation at all uni-
versities with large transportation sys-tems, such as UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Francisco  and UC Irvine. 
Despite the arguments 
that other campuses pay fees for the transportation system, Powers said the committee believes other policy changes could bring in more revenue to fund transportation with-out turning to student funds. 
“We don’t want to play 
chicken with the administra-tion and we’re taking them at their word that they have no money, but we have brain-stormed ways that more rev-enue could be raised, ” he said.
One proposal is to use a 
tiered parking-permit system to bring in more revenue. 
The committee suggests that the 
department reorganize parking per-mits with a system that charges lots depending on how proximate they are to campus. For example, the Regents Road East Lot, which requires a shut-tle to get to the university, would be a cheaper price than a parking pass for lots along Gilman Drive. 
Another proposal suggests that 
departmental shuttles — such as the Hillcrest and SIO shuttles — should be paid by the department, and that students using the shuttles pay money for bus passes instead of charging an overall stu-dent fee.        
D’ Autremont said that 
there were factual inaccu-racies in the council’s res-olution. He said that the university is already using a tiered system, in the case of Horton Hospital and Gilman Drive, and that while the tiered system could potentially bring in $50,000 in revenue, it is insufficient to bring in the 
$3 million necessary to maintain the current transportation system. 
The resolution also suggested a 
reallocation of registration fees to bring in more revenue, but d’ Autremont said that his department has never received funding from registration fees, and 
instead receives money from Campus Affairs, the Housing and Dining Department and parking permits. 
D’ Autremont also disagreed with 
the claim that the referendum is a last-minute attempt, and said that he has worked with three successive A.S. councils over the issue of budget, which he says is being stretched to the limit. 
In the past year, the department 
has moved from 52 to 40 buses while hauling an extra 2,000 people per day. 
“We have one of the finest univer-
sity public transportation systems in the world, but the money has to come from somewhere, and it won’t come from wishful thinking, ” he said.
Although d’ Autremont said that 
policy changes would create insuffi-cient revenue, VP Finance & Resources Peter Benesch said the council’s sug-gestion could bring in nearly the same amount of revenue without creating a student fee. 
Gupta will meet with Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox next Tuesday to dis-cuss the referendum, and the council will vote on it next Wednesday.

season again — that time of the 
year when a handful 
of broke organizations 
try their best to throw 
themselves onto the A.S. 
Council’s 
election bal-
lot, in hopes 
the student 
body might 
vote to fund 
them come 
springtime. 
This year, in an attempt 
to subsidize shuttle ser-
vice costs, the Parking and 
Transportation Department 
asked A.S. Council to run a ref-
erendum on its Spring Quarter 
ballot that would require each 
student to pay a $25-per-quarter 
fee. Although A.S. Council put 
off its decision on the issue last 
night (what else is new?), the spe-
cial committee created to review 
the proposal recommended that 
Parking and Transportation look 
elsewhere for a bailout — a gutsy 
move that we didn’t seen coming.
Though councilmembers are definitely brave for standing up to the department — and dodging yet another fiscal demand from above — that doesn’t change the fact that we could potentially have a transportation crisis on our hands next year.
Parking and 
Transportation director Brian d’ Autremont has been very upfront about the cuts he’ll have to make if the department can’t find a way to supplement its expenses.
In October of last year, he 
said that, if the referendum didn’t pass, he’ d be forced to halve shuttle services — elimi-nating Metropolitan Transit System Routes 3, 10, 150 and 921, and reducing the frequency of the Nobel, Arriba, Mesa and Hillcrest shuttle routes.
He’s positive this is the last 
resort, and keeps reminding us that we’re the only UC campus whose Botox Can’t

My usual sail through the 
Interweb was halted yes-terday by a popup image 
whose grotesqueness rivaled that of any Freddy Krueger nightmare: Heidi Montag’s surgically altered face — pulled, pinched, pressed and pinned into place to produce a life-size celebrity Mattel doll look, available in a tanning salon near you. 
Did I mention her boobs are 
now DDD?
Okay, before I start bashing 
Montag for making her surgeon into a butcher, let’s review her short biography.
Montag grew up in Crested 
Butte, Col. (population: 1,500). She lived simply and peacefully amongst the mountain dwellers until transferring to San Francisco’s Academy of Art University. There, she met Lauren Conrad — other-wise known as LC, from then-hit reality show “Laguna Beach” — who ultimately scored Montag a part on her scripted reality sequel “The Hills. ”
Here’s where we stop and try 
to piece together the present-day trainwreck with the eager-eyed “Hills” newbie we saw enter the twisted celebrity funhouse five years ago. 
The shift from one phase of her 
life (frolicking between the igloos of Crested Butte) to the next (walk-ing down Melrose trailed by a herd of paparazzi) is something that, to some degree, we’ve all experienced. A change of environment brings with it an inclination to reinvent oneself. Because, hey — if no one knows who we are, we can look and behave in a drastically different way without raising any eyebrows.
I remember coming to UCSD, 
just having surfaced from my frizzy-maned, headgear-heavy, “I let the water-polo guys cheat off me in Calculus” phase. Destined to be cooler than the old me, I tried (really hard) to look the part of the confident 18-year-old who hadn’t just gone on her first date six months prior, and who certainly hadn’t gone to every one of her high-school formals with a gay guy (though I always did have the pret-tiest corsage of all — God’s way of throwing me a bone, I guess).
At my crossroads, I was willing 
to go to great lengths to rid myself of the self-consciousness that con-sumed me in high school, and I’m 
sure on some level, Montag felt the 
same way. 
Not only was she entering a 
town far ritzier than Crested Butte, but she’ d be filmed opposite LC, whose uncanny resemblance to Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller’s wife, duh) made her the emblem of the naturally flawless high-school prin-cess we all loved to hate. 
If that had been me, I probably 
would’ve asked the show’s produc-ers to cast me as the mysterious character who wears a mask for the duration of the series. That prob-ably would have been less humiliat-  The Surf

See REPORT, page 5God knows we love the Loft. 
But we’re not ready for this kind of commitment.
Last year, one too many A.S. 
Council meetings dragged crank-ily to 2 a.m., until the council finally voted against letting the Price Center music venue the Loft ask stu-dents for $2.67 per quarter. (Or at least against putting it on the spring A.S. ballot. But that’s really the only ballot at UCSD famous enough to drag a mandatory 20 percent of the stu-dent body through a series of TritonLink checkmarks.)
This winter, after 
another few quar-ters of camping and seesawing, it looked like councilmembers had finally agreed the Loft’s fate should go before students on their 2010 ballot. Last week, they approved legislation for a $4.47 Loft item on the spring ballot. However, 
when the graduate student govern-
ment decided it wasn’t on board at the last minute, A.S. councilmem-bers apparently got cold feet.
Enemy lines were drawn at last 
night’s meeting. Fifteen Loft-lovers argued that students should be able to choose the (by now almost dou-bled) $4.47-per-quarter fee — one that would ensure at least 80 percent of all events at the Loft be “pay as you can” for undergraduates — for themselves. However, 10 dissenters came out of the woodwork to shoot down AVP of Academic Affairs Jordan Taylor’s long-toiled legisla-
tion at the last minute.
As hard as it is to 
watch the Loft ref-erendum burn after such a strung-out battle, our enthusiasm for the venue as a student-funded opera-tion has faded. “Pay as you can” is awesome, but more line items on our eBills are not. The 
arts must stay alive 
during the economic 
squeeze, but no one should be obli-gated to pay for them if they have no interest. 
Programming choices at the chic 
ArtPower venue are generally to be commended — we would go to see at least a few Loft artists a quarter even if they weren’t one staircase up 
from our afternoon cheesy tots — 
but the majority do tend to fall in the same vein of pretty indie-rock or “educational” snoozers.
The editorial board prides itself 
on being pretty involved cam-pus citizens — and still, we don’t remember to stop by the Loft more than once a quarter. So when we do, we would feel better paying $10 out of our own pockets (and vis-ible budgets) than demanding $4.47 from every last secluded engineering major on campus.
Not only do we already pay 
for the Loft in registration and University Centers fees — mislead-ing for tuned-out students who will 
only see a new line on their bill 
labeled “Loft, ” and think it a $5 steal — but we’re bound to feel too guilty not to throw a few bills in the pitiful “pay as you can” bucket as well.
It starts adding up, and not 
seeming so free-for-all, in a cliquish environment that only holds 235 students a night (and 
often reaches max 
capacity).
The Loft was 
purposefully built on a model relying on noncontinued funds (aka, administrators expected students to fall in love with the space, then shell out when its cool factor was at risk). We’ve gotten an inside look into the kind of “emergency funds” and “donations” that seem to magically appear when students aren’t such pushovers; it’s the same reason we’ve taken a more conservative stance on the (much more expensive, and impacting) transportation referen-dum.
It’s the right time for the A.S. 
Council to test University Centers’ bluff. Without our extra funds, the Loft won’t lose its space nor its sound system — so dance parties are still a possibility, as are org-sponsored events. 
Plus, the Loft is gaining cred-
ibility around San Diego for being a 
groovy live spot. The university has 
already put so much into its beauti-
ful art baby that there’s no risk of 
it fading away completely —so 
let’s fight the fee, get in 
line and fund our fun 
the old-fashioned 
way.

students don’t pay a transportation 
fee. But that point is moot when you consider that our intercollegiate activity fee is $118 per quarter, while Berkeley’s rough equivalent is $28 per semester. Each campus has its own history of bailouts and buf-fers. It’s not necessarily applicable to point a finger at other campuses and say, “but they’re doing it!”
So now, one of 
two things will hap-pen: 1) Parking and Transportation Services will crawl up to some administrator’s doorstep with one helluva puppy-dog face and guilt them into scrounging up some emergency funds, or 2) shuttle services will, in fact, be cut, and fitting onto over-crowded shuttles next year will be a yearlong lesson in acro-yoga.
The council is right to think an 
administrative bailout is still a pos-sibility, especiall y since encouraging 
sustainable transportation to cam-pus is UCSD’s most crucial bullet point on its list of green bragging rights. And we all know how much Chancellor Marye Anne Fox loves her green bragging rights.
Not to mention, if word gets out 
to prospective students that we’ve got a shitty public-transportation system, it might actually hurt UCSD’s allure. It’s a shame, really — just when the Loft was starting to redeem our infamous “socially dead” suffix.
Oh right, the Loft: There’s an 
example of a university-born busi-ness that claimed it couldn’t go on without our help. Weird — it mirac-ulously survived when A.S. Council refused to place it on the ballot last year. Guess Loft director Martin Wollensen has some extra-pitiful puppy eyes.
In recommending that A.S. 
Council reject the transportation referendum, the committee tasked with writing the document also sent along some suggestions they’ d like to see enacted before Parking and 
Transportation asks it to reconsider. 
Though we appreciate 
many of the commit-tee’s suggestions, they might not be enough to fill the financial gap d’ Autremont’s deal-ing with. He’s already shot down their idea of instituting tiered parking permits, argu-ing that Parking and Transportation already 
(sort of) does that and, besides, it wouldn’t earn him enough to make a difference anyway.
As for asking for funding from 
registration fees, it’s probably a long shot, but we might as well try.  
However, A.S. Council’s recom-
mendation to cut all MTS lines before attacking UCSD shuttles is not only outrageous, but telling of the tiny University Towne Center bubble in which many councilmem-bers live. Cutting off our outer-city lifelines will not only isolate us further from our surrounding com-munity, but also eliminate a valuable service for all those who can’t afford to live on campus or in its expensive condo foregrounds.
In the end, we won’t know until 
next year if the university’s pride — or our own — will sabotage trans-portation at UCSD, but it’s worth it to find out the hard way. In the meantime, d’ Autremont better be practicing his pout.

After constantly being com-
pared to a city’s worth of Sports Illustrated’s next bikini covers, it’s not surprising that Heidi decided to go under the knife. 
And it’s not just Heidi, or me. 
Girls everywhere try to exchange their freckled cuteness for some-thing more glamorous. 
One girl from my freshman 
dorm arrived on the scene as a spectacled, self-proclaimed AP nerd with a cropped haircut and simple style. Naturally adorable, she waited exactly one quarter before throw-ing on pounds of too-dark liquid foundation, instantly perfectly curled hair extensions and buying platform wedges. 
It’s reasonable that we want to 
try to shatter the tired “smart girls are ugly” stereotype (an especially prominent myth in Revelle), but at the same time, girls like my old suitemate and Montag have taken it way too far. 
By swathing themselves in sun-
kissed crap and swapping cardigans for navel ring-baring tube tops, both women look ten times more self-conscious than before.
With the extreme end of the 
spectrum now marked by Montag’s rock-hard face and watermelon boobs, we can all thank heaven that’s not us and learn from her checkstand humiliation that we’re better off as we are. Even the lesser “Clueless” makeover process should be kept in check: It doesn’t matter how thick your lips or glittery your eye makeup, if your personality sucks, you do too.
There’s nothing wrong with tak-
ing pride in your appearance; in fact, I’m sure the Kelsey of yester-year would applaud the 2010 me for ditching the caveman eyebrows and opting for a more sleek hairdo. But if you wake up one morning and your dog doesn’t recognize you, consider the chance that you’ve taken self-betterment too far.

Conductor Steven Schick has a hectic program prepared, beginning with a snapshot of the East Coast by Charles Ives in his best-known work, “Three places in New England.” Next is composer Lou Harrison’s Far East-inspired “Concerto for Pipa & String Orchestra,” and last, Antonin Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9 “From the New World.” Pipa virtuoso Wu Man — for whom Harrison’s concerto was written — is also scheduled to perform.

THIS WEEK ON CAMPUSIf Lil Wayne’s new ode to American 
rock ‘n’ roll is a joke, I’m not laughing.
OK, maybe I’m laughing a little. 
Like when he “listens to his own voice in his black Rolls Royce” on “ American Star. ” (His gals of choice wear cutoffs and blouses; Wayne wears trousers. Aw yeah.) Or the part where he literally 
announces “Bridge!” before delving 
into said shit-rock staple. It’s a projectile vomit of an interlude, Wayne scream-ing “Born and raised in the USA!” until his perma-croak goes so raw his eyes shoot slime. And the inhuman noises raping the guitar cavity can only be explained as Wayne himself gnawing at the strings with his diamond canines — apparently built more for glint.
I guess it’s just hard to laugh when, 
by all appearances, Wayne isn’t. Small moments of earnestness leave all illu-sion of parody half-mast and awkward. This wiry little dude has always been downtrodden, but now he’s stretching into the caverns of an Axl Rose country heart, without a hint of signature wit or gravity bong to make it all a hilarious game. I mean, all I really wanna do is get crunk and do Creed impressions. But my main man sets his Auto Tune on heartfelt and quacks some shit like:
“The sun don’t shine forever, and 
everything that glitter ain’t gold. ”
Or, “It feels like I’m runnin’ , and life 
is the miles. ”
No, really. What a fucking buzz kill. 
The only kind of depressed Weezy I care about is the one horning after girls who’re “down like the economy” and grinding out Martian fantasies on your granny’s bed-rocks. 
Wayne’s made a lot of questionable 
choices — the bindi tattoo, to begin — but Feb. 2’s Rebirth  is a monster UFO-
sized cowpie to potentially outstink the lingering charms of all nerdy hiccups 
past. Ever wonder what Kid Rock would 
sound like with a mouthful of pokey grillpieces and Auto Tune on lock? Lust no longer, for the abominable white-trash blackman has been unleashed.

Just in case “Valentine’s Day” doesn’t look cheesy enough, one of the film’s starlets has debuted a single to match its release. Y ep, 
Taylor Swift’s “Today Was a Fairytale” is your latest Ben & Jerry binge song. As anyone well-versed in Swift knows, she’s good at three things: dropping Grammys, handling Kanye  and croon-
ing about unrequited love. “Fairytale” is no dif-ferent from the pop melodies off 2008’s Fearless , 
except that it lacks the narrative that made “Love Story” a chart-topper. In place of plot, we get sac-charine nothingness — “I wore a dress/ Y ou wore a dark gray T-shirt/ Y ou told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess” — and a lulling elec-tric guitar to boot. Is it just me, or is this whole “White Horse” routine becoming white noise?
— Jenna Brogan 
Hiatus EditorAfter a five-year  absence and being overtaken 
by obscurity (it’s hard to garner publicity when nobody sees a face behind the music), 
Gorillaz is back with “Stylo, ” the first single leaked from Plastic Beach , their upcoming album due out 
March 9. The track revives the Gorillaz’ eclectic curiosity, delivering a dark synth-electro beat that meshes oddly well with distorted background choir. The lead voices, provided by the soulful Bobby Womack and ultra-cool Mos Def, lend a strange emotive power, bearing few similarities to the relaxed, freewheeling style evident on smash hit of yesteryear “Feel Good Inc. ” While not a mas-terpiece, “Stylo” deserves props for eschewing your typical hot-hit formula in pursuit of uncommon — if not quite stunning — combination.
— Imran Manji  
Senior Staff WriterForty years after Hendrix died, his estate is still releasing unfinished tracks like “Valleys of Neptune” — but without catchy hooks or 
trademark solos, “Valleys” doesn’t sound much like the rock god. The closest it gets to a famous guitar freakout is the intro: a schizoid, off-tempo instrumental breakdown that rolls right into the verse. Everything is muzzled behind the vocals, so it’s like a double-speed version of the melan-choly “The Wind Cries Mary. ” After a few listens, though, the track unlocks itself — the heavy, echoed guitar behind Hendrix’s forceful vocals gives the track a rambling energy. If you’re not too stubborn to let go of this guitar god’s glory tracks, “Valleys” will, at the very least, dust off your air-strument.

Podington Bear — a side project of the Hush record label — noticed them on a news feed.
Lucky for Tsui, producer Chad Crouch liked her soft 
little jingles so much, he decided to help her out with some simple backup instrumentation. Thus, the five del-icate tracks of Milk the Moon  were born in August 2009. 
Tsui’s Internet personality is rounded out by a series 
of lifelike, yet slightly unexpected, nature sketches. On her blog, you can scroll past a moose with a pumpkin on its head, followed by a platypus balancing an apple on its snout. Y ou might begin to notice a theme. 
“I really like animals in weird situations, ” Tsui said. “I 
think it’s funny to draw them doing human things. ” 
The cut-and-paste handiwork on the cover of Moon  
doesn’t betray her ultra-indie, cute-over-
load aesthetic. 
“I get inspired by the imagination and 
imagery in kids’ books, ” Tsui said. In fact, 
she said she dreams of being a children’s-book 
illustrator one day. (So it comes as no surprise 
that her toddler-friendly stage name directly 
references Babar .)
One standout on Milk  is the whimsical 
“Face First, Feet First, ” which Tsui claims 
was inspired by a meteor shower that she 
watched with her family. In the clearest

the lullaby cassette your parents played

fact the nostalgic brainchild of a certain Marshall College sophomore. And in case you took Tsui’s self-pigeonholing on MySpace to heart, the peace-ful accoustics and unaffected vocals of EP Milk The 
Moon  don’t actually sound like “whales fighting. ” A 
more accurate comparison might be Iron & Wine, Tristan Prettyman or the Moldy Peaches, a la the “Juno” soundtrack. 
Drooled over as “bedroom recordings”

Senior Staff Writer
Awash in dark, blue-grey 
lighting and set in a clas-sically romantic inter-
national city, “From Paris With Love” doesn’t exactly scream action-packed CIA film. However, in spite of itself, director Pierre Morel manages to give the flick a bit of original edge before it col-lapses into a routine partners-in-crime fighting flick we all know and tolerate.
James Reece (Jonathan Rhys 
Meyers) is a fresh-faced, newly engaged assistant to a U.S. ambas-
sador in France who is about to 
be assigned his first mission as a big-time CIA agent. Partnered with break-the-rules badass Charlie Wax (John Travolta), the two embark on what appears to be a run-of the-mill drug bust. The job quickly transforms into a mad dash to prevent a terrorist attack, with little explanation as 
to how the former mutated into 
the latter. 
Shaved bald enough to make 
Mr. Clean jealous, Wax struts around shooting just about any-thing with a pulse. Tired of the rest of the world talking shit about the US? Wax busts hordes of Chinese, Middle Eastern, and even French drug dealers while peppering the action with one-liner gems like “Wax on, Wax off!” Meanwhile, Reece lumbers along the sidelines, occasionally grumbling about having to drag around a vase full of coke like a pack mule, gun sitting forgotten in his holster. 
The film doesn’t task itself 
with explanations, but rather entangles itself in its own plot complications, tripping itself every time it changes from one Paris locale to another. Somehow the story falls back down the rab-bit hole, reaching a semi-lucid cli-max with the discovery of Reece’s fiance’s (Kasia Smutniak) inten-
tions to bomb the U.S. ambassa-
dor’s meeting. 
Of course, Reece gives that 
manipulative French temptress what she deserves: one gunshot to the face, loaded with bittersweet irony. 
Dashed with ill-placed, slow-mo action sequences and less than impressive combat, “Love” certainly won’t have “Watchmen” shaking in its heavily inked boots. Even so, the thriller’s haphazardly timed deaths add a much-needed shock factor, poking fun at Wax’s Terminator-like efficiency, as Reece dodges a rain of bloody, mangled corpses issuing from the top of a stairwell. The chuckles keep coming, thanks to a well-played performance by Travolta as woman-rider Wax and the she-nanigans of desk-jockey Reece. 
“Love’s” excess of blood, 
explosions and hookers through-
out hint that writer Luc Besson 
has spent far too much time play-ing Grand Theft Auto, resulting in a film sans creative dialogue, heaped with flashy explosions and plenty of gun smoke. Ultimately, it’s the actors and cinematography that pick up the slack. 
But never mind that; this is 
about violence, sex and kick-ass 
American good guys in Paris’ 
grimy streets. Even plot holes go down easier with a fistful of coke and a quart — or in this case, a liter of blood.Ye Olde Radiohead in Renaissance times: that’s 
Midlake’s flute-driven shtick on The Courage of 
Others , its third album 
and most Faire-folky by far. Midlake’s production values have skyrock-eted since the lo-fi psych pop of debut Bamnan 
and Slivercork, and now frontman Tim Smith and company don flow-ing robes and give in to hippie pagan pageantry. Before they were praying to the gods of Flaming Lips and Sgt. Pepper, but now they’ve definitely got Jethro Tull’s serene folk in their reverent, yet morose guitar mantras.And morose mantras 
are exactly how you’ d classify Courage ’s 11 
burn-outs, for they all feature arpeggio acoustic guitars layered en masse, 
Middle-Earthy flute jams and medieval minstrel harmonies. It’s hard not to feel inundated by woodsy vibes frolicking hereto and thereupon each and every track. 
Take opener and lead 
single “ Acts of Man, ” where Smith nobly pro-claims “ And when the acts of man/ Cause the ground to break open/ Oh, let me inside, let me inside, not to wait” like a prophecy on the altar. It’s a portent of what’s to come: 10 more tracks that cry wolf in the same mid-tempo snooze zone. The LP’s procession is careful-ly crafted, to be sure, but a few Neil Y oung-esque rock numbers thrown in the mix would’ve fit perfectly in this super-serious throwback and corrected Courage ’s 
finger-plucked slouch toward boredom.As it stands, the best 
variation of its stoic folk mold is the title track, with a gorgeous flute and acoustic-chord pairing that ascends as Smith recites “He trembles alone” over and over with sputter-ing electric guitars filling silence. Fleet Foxes made it look so easy.

for a year, and this closet log of glam-
fetish feces is all he left us to chew on.
Y es, Wayne singlehandedly revived 
modern hip-hop — by playing X-treme scrabble (sexy edition) all over it — but he also killed it, by mak-ing everyone think all they had to do was fart out the first thing that came to mind, and catch it in a vocoder. But whether or not you like the cash-jingling, “suck my clip, ” fuck-you-and-your-fine-ho-too schtick on which he’s founded new group Y oung Money, you’ve got to admit, shit’s catchy.
Rebirth , on the other hand, makes 
me feel terrible about all music, ever, ruined in one burp by my cherished Weez-bird here, kind of making me hate life in general — without even being able to go ape-shit on the living-room couch.
Though it’s hard to remember a 
time when the world wasn’t wrapped in Wayne’s dread tentacle, turns out it was only two years ago that Tha 
Carter III obliterated frat houses and Pitchfork (richdork) cubicles alike. Maybe this horrific new album is to prove that nothing — not even swal-lowing a sloppy Joe whole and wiping the other end with the star-spangled banner — could de-throne Weezy at this point. But he should be careful: Jay-Z (on his game lately, if mostly still irrelevant) has declared the death of Auto-Tune with a sneer that smells of beef, and Eminem blasts Wayne in dragon’s breath on Rebirth ’s only 
reprieve, “Drop the World. ”
So, I guess I was about to say, 
“fall of Lil Wayne, ” but — fuck no. It takes some agile balls to stoop this low. Damn if it isn’t killing me softly though.▶ NARROW, MYVTWHNL;KZIJJTM3QVO

Keep on sipping that poison, 
Romeo and Juliet, sink-ing with the Titanic, Jack 
and Rose and heading toward that white light, Noah and Allie — there’s a new “greatest love story of all time. ” But this time they’re writing letters. Nicholas Sparks, the golden boy of emo-tastic romance novels, has struck again. And after his box office-exploding successes with novel-turned-films “The Notebook” and “ A W alk to Remember, ” you better hold on to that Kleenex because this one’s going to trigger water works. 
Set in a cliche Southern town, 
boy meets girl. They converse, flirt, look up at the moon and fall in love within the span of “two perfect weeks. ” All cynical eye-rolls aside, this tale of young love is not nearly as nauseatingly cheesy as the trailer — complete with steamy make-out sessions in the rain and acoustic love ballads — would suggest.
Savannah (Amanda Seyfried)  
is spending spring break at her affluent parents’ beach house on the coast of South Carolina when she meets John (Channing Tatum), a bad boy turned reformed army soldier waiting to be deployed. The film wastes no time jumping right into their accelerated relationship, because as we know, after two weeks are up, they’ll be separated. Back to college, back to the war and back to reality.
Commenting not only on the difficulties of long-distance relationships, “Dear John” is also critical of the painfully lonely life of a soldier, living each day with the sole com-fort of letters from loved ones. “ I think [the film] has a little more bite to it, and maybe just because the content matter is very relevant right now, ” Channing Tatum said. “It’s about what’s happening right now, the 9/11 of it all. ”
The acting is surprisingly well 
done, too. We go into the theater expect-ing to see Tatum with the emo-tional range 
of a gorilla (his trademark) and Seyfried bouncing around like a blonde ditz, but come out in awe of their ability to embody the gut-wrenching emotions of their coun-terparts. 
But chemistry is where “Dear 
John” falls short. For a couple that’s supposedly madly in love, we’re not buying it. They walk hand in hand, canoodle and make out, yet some-thing still feels missing. 
We want to believe these char-
acters are truly in love. Take it from Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling, who dated after filming “The Notebook. ” Those two had a full-fledged fire going, whereas Tatum and Seyfried are hopelessly rubbing sticks together. Maybe the fact that both actors have off-screen honey buns pours water on the candle of love, but either way, the film suffers because of it. 
Luckily, Tatum spends enough 
of the film shirtless and surfing for us to care much.

Tomorrow, in a Year
The Knife
RABID RECORDS
Following the experi-
mental electro-pop of 2006’s Silent Shout, the 
Knife take a rather unusual approach with Tomorrow, 
in a Year : The Swedish duo 
write an opera.
That’s right, an opera. The freakiness doesn’t 
end there. Commissioned by Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma in collaboration with Mt. Sims and Planningtorock, the electronic opera is based on Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species. The show premiered in Copenhagen in September, and now anyone can download Karin Dreijer-Andersson and Olof Dreijer’s dramatic wails via the show’s website.
The unlikely kinship is 
as strange in practice as it is in theory. A combina-tion of obscure, animalis-tic images and electronic drones, Tomorrow, in a Year  
doesn’t really say much about Darwin; it uses his theories as a kind of structural foun-dation. Simply put, the music evolves. 
The album begins in 
almost complete silence. “Intro” is laden with discon-certing beeps and ambient noise that — with a bong rip or two — could almost be the soundtrack to the creation of the universe. The next eight tracks are in the same vein: confusing, noisy and slightly terrifying. It takes nearly 43 minutes before anything even resem-bling a song takes form. 
At the start of the second 
disc, things start to look up, particularly with the 11-minute opus, “Colouring Of Pigeons, ” a song that could very well be the band’s crowning achieve-ment. It begins with primal drums and operatic shriek-ing, but soon gives way to Andersson’s melancholic cries. It sounds exactly like what you would expect of an opera by the Knife: a more theatrical version of the omi-nous electronica for which it is so well known. 
But when it comes down 
to it, the album brings a whole new meaning to the word “inaccessible. ” For every “Colouring of Pigeons” there is another 10 minutes of absolute nothingness.

Smoke and Mirrors
Lifehouse
GEFFEN
The last time anyone cared about Lifehouse, they were playing at a high school 
prom, courtesy of a JC Penney contest. Apparently releas-ing a couple of new albums was the next logical step for the Christian rock band from Malibu, Calif.
Judging from the genuine, 
though futile, effort Smoke and 
Mirrors  — their first release in 
almost three years — one can’t help but want to pat the boys on the back just for trying. 
Lifehouse spends the dura-
tion of Mirrors mimicking Nickelback’s manufactured growling. Songs like lead single “Halfway Gone” copy a Kings of Leon vocal melody, but all attempts at mirroring a more popular band, make their music repetitive and meaningless. Even an appearance by Chris Daughtry on “Had Enough, ” can’t save them; the songs are cut and dry, ready for radio — but good for little else. Y ou’ d never guess they spent over a year in the studio producing the record. 
Instead of slow-dance ready 
waltzes like “Y ou and Me” and “Hanging by a Moment, ” we get trite prose: “Cause I’m halfway gone and I’m on my way/ And I’m feeling, feelin’ feelin’ this way. ” While the single plays over drum rhythms and call-and-response vocals, apparently the band members weren’t fee-lin’ much of anything when they wrote the tracks that follow. 
Anti-drunk-driving ballad 
“From Where Y ou Are” starts out thoughtful with “I miss the years that were erased/ I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face” coated over a desolate piano melody, but never manages to pick up. The group attempts to unite rock balladry and spiritual beliefs, but the stale guitar and power chords never amp the songs enough, and after a while it feels like even lead singer Jason Wade has grown tired of singing his forlorn ballads.
The group plows through 
one mess after another, making the added synths and passionate vocals less convincing as time wears on. It’s hard to knock a group that tries so hard to seem meaningful, but 12 tracks that sound like alternate versions of each other — occasionally varied by some drum backbeats and a few pounding guitar chords — can’t save the album.

10ALBUMREVIEWS
Piles of planets on the tip of my shoe/ I could count them forever/ Face first toward space together. ”
Surprisingly thoughtful 
and cryptic lyrics, sung in a voice that’s cool as a glass of water, keep her songs from melting into lukewarm MySpace oblivion. 
“I try not to be too lit-
eral, ” Tsui said. “I think it’s important for the listener to make stories, to try to figure the meaning out themselves. ” 
Tsui said her secret song-
writing spot is the UCSD Food Co-Op, where she plays her guitar alone at night after she finishes working. 
“I’m an introvert when 
it comes to making music, ” she said. 
But not when it comes to 
playing it. Tsui has played a couple of shows at the Che Cafe, and hopes to promote herself around San Diego next year  — once she gets a car. 
“For me, making music 
is more than a hobby. I want people to hear it. ”

foil team, ” Runyan said. “They need to 
learn from this experience, so they can reach their potential. ” 
The men defeated University of 
Detroit, Cleveland State University, Wayne State University and the University of  North Carolina — a win 
Runyan said he was pleasantly sur-prised by . 
UCSD will be back in action on 
Feb. 6 against the California Institute of Technology  and UC Irvine, after 
which they have only to prepare for conference championships.
“The goal is to get as many people 
as we can to nationals, ” Runyan said. “We’re realistically hoping to get two to five fencers there. ” 
Readers can contact Yvonne Chow at 
ychow@ucsd.edu.“ Alex Henley has been swimming 
amazingly all year, pulling out victo-ries pretty much whenever we need them, ” Cunningham said. “Right now it’s really exciting to watch her swim. ”
Also on the women’s side, O’Brien 
won the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:06.29, and senior cap-tain Cunningham took the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:22.64.
“It feels pretty good to win an 
event, even though we didn’t win overall, ” Cunningham said. “I just had my motivations for my swim, and felt good to pull out ahead against a D-I school with D-I swimmers. ”
On the men’s side, senior Daniel 
Perdew won multiple individual events, and also swam for the 400-yard freestyle relay team that came in first. 
Perdew won his prime event — the 
50-yard freestyle — with a lightning -quick flip off the wall, and finished at 21.16 seconds. Following his freestyle performance, Perdew took the 100-yard butterfly in 51.29.
More wins for the men’s team 
included senior Juan Pablo Carrillo in the 100-yard breaststroke (57.38), senior Todd Langland in the 100-yard freestyle (46.58) and freshman John Masehi-Lano in the 200-yard breast-stroke (2:08.22). The  men’s 400-yard 
freestyle relay team of Langland, fresh-man Julius Espiritu, sophomore Blake Langland  and Perdew closed out the 
meet with a win in 3:05.80.
Once the diving teams took to 
the board, senior Danielle Niculescu snagged first in the three-meter and second in the one-meter events for the women. Sophomore Bryan McGrory matched Niculescu for the men, and freshman Tyler Runsten grabbed third in the one-meter.  
In two weeks, the Tritons will now 
travel to Long Beach in two weeks for the Pacific Coast Swimming Conference championship meet. 
The Tritons will try to make the best 
of their strong season by qualifying as many swimmers as they can for the NCAA Division-II Championships, which take place from Mar. 10 to Mar.  13 in Canton, Oh. 
“This is the last chance to qualify 
for nationals, so I think the whole team is going to be focused and swim hard, ” Cunningham said. “We’re just going to be ready to move fast. ”

block in the first set. The Tritons narrowed the 49ers’ lead to three, but LBSU expanded the margin to 21-15 
after another block — prompting the 
Tritons to call their second timeout.
Back on the court, the 49ers 
extended their lead to nine points before closing out the set 30-22.
“It was a rough night for everyone, 
in all phases of the game, ” Ehrman said. “We couldn’t execute any part of the game well. They played a great match, and we couldn’t stop them 
from an offensive standpoint. We 
couldn’t pass well, and couldn’t get our offense going. ”
The Tritons will get a shot a 
redemption on Friday, Feb. 5 when they rematch against No. 6 Cal State Long Beach at 7 p.m. in RIMAC Arena.
“From a team standpoint, this is 
the first time all season we’ve had a 
full week of practice before a match, ” 
Ehrman said. “We’ve been hitting the gym, practicing passing, setting tempo, — and outside hitters have been taking big swings. ”
After the rematch against 
LBSU, the Tritons will meet Hope International on Feb. 6 in Fullerton, Calif.

OUTLAST TRITONSIN DAVIS
FENCING — Nationally acclaimed fencers from 
across the U.S. flew in to duel it out at a two-day event in Evanston, Ill. from Jan. 30 to 31. Hosted by Northwestern University at its Sports and Aquatic Center, the Northwestern Duals is one of the most competitive tournaments in which UCSD fencers participate.
The Duals was an opportunity for the Triton 
fencers to be exposed to the level of competition they expect to face at the regionals in March. 
There were three more women’s teams in the 
compeition than there were men’s, and therefore the women tallied more wins.
Men’s and women’s scores were combined to 
form a composite final score for the duel.  UCSD went 9-5 overall, with all five losses against national superstars Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Princeton University, University of Notre Dame and Duke University.
The women’s team chalked up a number of 
wins, helping the Tritons hold their own against  fierce Division-I opponents like No. 7 Temple, the University of North Carolina and Stanford University.
“We credit the maturity of the women’s team, 
who have a lot of seniors and juniors who were able to perform under pressure, ” assistant coach Josh Runyan said.
Each day featured eight rounds of duels, or 
five to six hours of fencing.
“The tournament was  grueling, ” Runyan said. 
“To fence this many fencers in this tournament is taxing. ”
Despite the heavy workload, UCSD scored 
some notable victories.
On the men’s side, freshman foil  Joseph Schenkel won three bouts, and sophomore foil  
Michael Fong added two against west-coast rival Stanford. 
Schenkel has had an outstanding season thus 
far, with strong tournament records and a third-place finish in the 2009 Collegiate Open. 
Schenkel said that, in the tournament, there 
were some losses that should not have happened, but that the second day was still an improvement from the first.
“There was a lot of team bonding ... the team 
is really supportive of one another, ” Schenkel said.
 Though unable to tally as many victories as 
the women last weekend, the men’s team is keep-ing their hopes high for regionals. 
“We have a very talented, fairly young men’s

SWIMMING — While the majority 
of the campus’ attention was focused on the Jan. 30 Spirit Night basketball games, the UCSD swimming and div-ing teams were fighting their own battle against UC Davis.
The meet signified the last official 
competition before conference cham-pionships, and brings to close a stellar season for the Triton swimmers that saw the men go 5-3 and the women go 8-5 in all competitions.
Despite several stellar performances 
from individual athletes — the Tritons were overcome by their in-state oppo-nents.
Both the men’s and women’s teams 
won seven of 16 events, falling by scores of 174-122 and 155-145, respectively.  
“It’s really hard to lose, ” senior cap-
tain Carianne Cunningham said. “Our goal yesterday was definitely to come out on top, and it was extremely close. The fact that it was so close  is pretty exciting. 
We’ve come a long way. ”
The day began with the women’s 200-
yard medley relay. Junior captain Anju Shimura, sophomore Mercedes O’Brien, junior Jessica Ferguson and freshman Amber Tan fell to the Aggies by a mere second — a race that foreshadowed many close finishes to come.
Shortly following the relay event, 
freshman Beth Dong captured the Tritons’ first win with a dominating fin-ish in the 1,000-yard freestyle, posting a time of 10:34.99.
Sophomore Alex Henley turned in 
the most comprehensive Triton perfor-mance of the day: She turned in first -place finishes for the 200-yard free-style (1:53.61), the 500-yard freestyle (5:06.59) and the 200-yard individual 
medley (2:05.69).
The women swept the podium in the 
500-yard freestyle with freshmen  Megan 
Thomas and Olivia Martens following Henley in second and third, respectively.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL —  On Jan. 27, No. 
12-ranked UCSD men’s volleyball team opened its season at home, squaring off against Princeton University. The Tritons defeated the Tigers in straight sets 30-24, 30-24, 30-25 —bumping their overall record to 3-5. 
UCSD hit at .518, setting a new school high 
for hitting percentage. Last season’s record — .469 — was set against George Mason University. 
The Tritons led 13-11 in the first set, before 
going on a 12-6 run to extend the to 25-17. UCSD claimed the first set when junior middle 
blocker Calvin Ross smashed over the final kill.
In the second set, UCSD grabbed the lead at 
11-9 after two Tiger errors. A subsequent kill by 
senior opposite Frank Fritsch and a Tiger error gave the Tritons a four-point lead; from there,  Princeton never got closer than three, and UCSD closed the set with three straight points.
Junior setter Phil Bannan and senior setter 
Erik Sierks provided passes which freshman middle blocker Cyrus Kiani and Fritsch capital-
ized on for 12 and 11 kills, respectively. Bannan contributed 30 assists in two sets, 
over which the Tritons hit .565 and .577 respec-
tively. Sierks added 17 assists in the final set of the match, where UCSD hit at .441.
Junior outside hitter Will Ehrman — who 
added eight kills in the first two sets — said that despite the win and school record, the Triton performance left room for improvement.
“We won that game and were happy to come 
away with the result, ” Ehrman said. “But we didn’t play very well in that match, and didn’t execute as well as we wanted to. ”
Following its win against Princeton, UCSD 
traveled to Long Beach to face No. 8 Cal State Long Beach. The last time the two teams went head to head, the Tritons and 49ers battled to 
a four-set thriller in which three of four games 
were decided by two points.  
This time, though, UCSD fell to Cal State 
Long Beach in three sets, 30-22, 30-22, 30-21.
After putting on an offensive clinic against 
Princeton, the Tritons were restrained to a .045 hitting percentage, while Cal State Long Beach hit at .387. The Tritons were out-blocked by LBSU 20 to three in the match. 
The loss left UCSD with a 1-4 record in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, while Long Beach State improved to 3-2 in conference play.
LBSU jumped out to a 15-11 lead after a The Tritons hit a school-best 
.518 clip during their route of Princeton University.

Sophomore opposite hitter Shane Veiga rose to block a shot in the Jan. 27 win over Princeton University. The Tritons hit at .51 8 in 
their straight set- victory over the Tigers. The hitting percentage set the record for the highest in school history.See SWIMMING page 11
