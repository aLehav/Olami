“YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND”

After campaigning on a 
platform last year that prom-
ised to bring a football team to UCSD, A.S. President Utsav Gupta is postponing those plans until at least Fall Quarter 2010, and is instead exploring an overhaul of the athletics department.
A meeting between Gupta 
and Director of Athletics Earl Edwards last week led to the conception of three different options for an athletics refer-endum. Because Edwards deter-mined that the options need to be further researched in terms of feasibility, no mention of a football team will appear on the Spring Quarter election ballot.
Gupta said that this postponement 
would put the referendum under the voting power of the 2010-11 council. 
“We’re not pursuing it this quarter, ” 
Gupta said. “Voting will depend on the next student council. And this will probably hap-pen in [the] next year. ”
Instead of solely focusing on the creation 
of a football team, the new options look to upgrade UCSD athletics teams to Division-I. As it stands, all UCSD athletic teams are Division-II except volleyball and water polo, which do not have separate national divi-sions.
The first and original option Gupta has 
proposed for next year’s A.S. Council — which would cost students $20 per quarter — is the creation of a D-II football team.
The second option would upgrade all 
UCSD athletic teams from D-II to D-I, as well as create a D-I football team.
The final option would upgrade all UCSD 
athletic teams from D-II to D-I without the addition of a football team.
According to Edwards, UCSD teams do 
not currently compete against schools of the same academic caliber due to their D-II standing. He said this might contribute to the lack of enthusiasm students exhibit toward athletics.
“Having a [D-II] football team doesn’t 
make sense if we only have one team to play, ” Edwards said. “This plan is not so much about moving to D-I than to compete against schools more like UCSD. We don’t have much in common with the schools we’re playing against right now. ” 
Moving to D-I would involve competing 
against schools such as UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UC Davis.
Gupta is highly in favor of the sec-
ond, most extreme option — which would advance all UCSD athletics to D-I in addition to creating a new D-I football team — and said the current delay in the referendum will be worth it in the long run.
“We’re trying to move all our teams to 
D-I, ” Gupta said. “That’s worth holding off a quarter or two on the question. ”
The A.S. Council and the athletics depart-
ment are hiring a fiscal consultant to evaluate the cost of all options.According to Edwards, the cost would be in the millions. The selec-
tion process for the consultant will begin next 
month.

Specialized tracks within social sci-
ence majors may be reduced, said A.S. Social Sciences Senator Irfan Ahmed, who announced the proposal at the Jan. 13 A.S. Council meeting. 
The proposal is a potential solution for 
offsetting the recent decrease in state funding for the University of California, and was sug-gested by Dean of Social Sciences Jeff Elman.
Currently, majors such as political science 
and international studies allow students to specialize in secondary tracks that are supple-mentary to their core requirements. These tracks make majors interdisciplinary, empha-size subjects such as anthropology, history, communications, linguistics and literature to offer students a more diverse education.
Under Elman’s proposal, these existing 
tracks would be combined to create fewer and broader subjects of focus. 
According to Ahmed, the budgetary defi-
cit is the motive behind the proposal. 
“The department is looking at a 20-per-
cent budget cut from the state: a $60 million

international studies and poli-sci departments to consider changing major requirements. Wildfire doesn’t have shit on the spread of dubstep. The slow, wompy 
darker-sister of the electronic club beat only leaked out the London back-alleys five short years ago; now, propelled by entertainment 
capitalists the planet over — each determined to be the first to expose the underground — dubstep is under death threat of overpopularity.
UK originals are being flown into LA, dangerously visible under the 
Hollywood magnifying glass. Top-40 leeches like Snoop Dogg, Rihanna and Britney Spears are catching wind — kicking sparse Lil Jon jangles for the slugging halts and screeches of dubstep (albeit at its safest and sim-plest). Even Wu-Tang tried to ride the sparks of the exploding scene with a disc of classic verses remixed by “indie” dubstep producers.
I mean, fuck — as of three weeks ago, UCSD has its own dubstep club. 
That’s when you know the hip factor has blown.

At last night’s A.S. Council meeting, a proposal 
to change student-media regulations — which would have mandated administrative supervision of coun-cil-funded publications — was shelved indefinitely 
after representatives from student publications such as the Koala , the 
Muir Quarterly  and the Sixth Sense  
showed up to protest. They argued that the guidelines would impose on free speech and hinder the growth of new media. 
The proposal’s failure did not come 
as a surprise to Campuswide Senator Adam Kenworthy, who helped draft it along with Marshall Senator Brian McEuen, Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey and Associate Vice President of Student Organizations Andrew Ang. At an open forum held Jan. 26, Kenworthy suggested that media representatives focus instead on the more realistic possibility of a media review board.
“I think we’re pretty certain this is going to fail, ” 
Kenworthy said at the forum. “I don’t think we should even be talking about this right now. My favorite part of this legislation is the media review board. ”
Kenworthy and Ang announced their plans to 
begin drafting a new proposal that would eliminate the faculty sponsorship aspect entirely, and priori-tize the creation of a media-specific board to handle funding.
As it stands, all campus organizations — includ-

receive their quarterly funding from the Student Organization Funding Advisory Board. The media review board would consist of A.S. mem-bers, students and representatives from publications who would deter-mine funding for media orgs. The media guidelines weren’t 
the only pieces of legislation to hit a roadblock; a referendum that would have granted the Loft around $810,000 in funds was tabled for later discussion after it was rejected by the Graduate Student Association on Jan. 25 and councilmembers were forced to rewrite the proposal.The GSA was unwilling to ask 
graduate students to vote on a man-datory fee of $3.82 on the Spring Quarter ballot. Councilmembers felt that they needed more time to review the new legislation, since the quarterly fee for undergraduates would now be $4.47 instead of $3.82. 
“I am not one of the privileged 
ones who’ve seen the new lan-guage [of the Loft referendum], ” Vice President of Student Life Ricsie Hernandez said. “I’ d like to at least see what changes were made and offer amendments. ”

hoursa day,
7
days aweekwww.ucsd guardian.or gThings got heated between 
councilmembers at last night’s meeting as they 
argued over legislation and the impeachment of absent council-members.
The forum was crowded with 
members of student media organiza-tions, who vocalized their opposition to the A.S. media guidelines proposal. However, the media guidelines were postponed indefinitely and therefore were not up for discussion at this meeting. 
Campuswide 
senator Bryant Pena, who attended 
the Housing, Dining and Hospitality planning committee meeting, said HDH is looking into raising prices of dorm rooms. 
Warren senator Alyssa Wing  
challenged Muir senators Ryan 
O’Rear and Lynne Swerhone  to a 
Spirit Night bet. Warren College, currently in the lead for Spirit Week points, would wear Muir College clothing if Muir ended up outshow-ing them at the basketball games in RIMAC Arena this Saturday. O’Rear and Swerhone accepted the bet.
Campuswide senator Wafa Ben 
Hassine presented “Discrimination 
in UCSD Press: A Threat to our University’s Integrity, ” in which she showed derogatory images from the Koala that have sparked controversy in recent years. 
Hassine aims to form a committee 
that would work with Student Legal Services to research the legality of the publication of offensive material.
A Sun God Festival pre-party 
is slated for Wednesday of Week Seven, the week of the musical event. Campuswide senator Adam 
Kenworthy  secured the ‘ Atrium’ — an indoor food court area in Price Center East — for a afternoon of games like horseshoes and non-alcoholic beer pong.
 True to his word, Advocate 
General Parminder Sandu, brought a 
resolution of impeachment for Pena, Biological Sciences senator John Erhart and Sixth College senator Kevin Nguyen  to the table.
After one too 
many personal sob stories, coun-cilmembers voted to not impeach the three sena-tors.
The council 
next discussed the California Brown Act, which states that issues of new business may only be presented on the council floor if the council, by a two-thirds vote of members, or a unanimous vote of members present if the two-thirds number isn’t reached, calls for an item to be urgent and of immediate action.
AVP of Academic Affairs Jordan 
Taylor  noted that two-thirds of vot-
ing members weren’t present at the council meeting, and feared that this act would eliminate new business completely.
The council passed a motion to 
table this item until its next meeting.
The Graduate Student 
Association rejected the newly written Loft referendum, whose language was passed by the A.S. Council last week.
President Utsav Gupta  said that 
the council needed to reconsider the referendum’s language, but said he felt uncomfortable discussing it in new business since the language and fee amount had changed.
At the end of the night, council 
voted to discuss the Loft and trans-portation referendums next week. +W]VKQT-`K][M[;MVI\WZ

alter the bacteria’s frequencies to react to environmental changes.

off their work from last year, when Hasty and Tsimring first induced a fluorescent flash in cultured E. coli  
cells by injecting them with a manufactured virus that changed their genetic makeup. 
Next, the scientists stimulat ed the cells using posi-
tive and negative feedback components to design a net-work of synchronized bacteria.
The synchronization of these cells and their flashing 
has helped scientists understand more about the pat-terns of communications between organisms. 
Hasty said that the fluorescent flashes, or oscilla-
tions, may p ossib
ly be used in health care. 
“We use these oscillations as a type of sensor, ” he 
said. “When they are individual and out of sync, we just see noise — but together, they make a signal. ”
According to Hasty, this fluorescent signal could be 
used as a biosensor that can distinguish patterns in an environment and react to them. For example, the bac-teria could be used to indicate  the frequency of drugs 
administered to a patient by sensing the time interval between doses. 
The research could also one day lead to genetic sen-
sors that would provide humans with early warning of potential environmental threats, such as temperature changes or poisons. 
Hasty and Tsimring emphasized that the research 
was highly theoretical and said that they will move on to testing neural connections in mammals and work on finding different ways to apply this discovery to practi-cal pharmaceutical uses.
The project is an extension of the work done at 
UCSD’s new BioCircuits Institute, which opened in Urey Hall last July. The institute focuses on the study of cell networks such as neurons, and how they might be controlled. 
Tsimring said that learning how to control small 
portions of gene circuitry —  such as the synchroniza-
tion of the E. coli cultures — allows researchers to 
understand more about how the cell bodies work as a whole.
The BioCircuits Institute studies the biological net-
works that regulate cell activity, such as fluoresent flash-ing, and organisms’ responses to their environment. 
“We’re bringing together people in neural connectiv-
ity and biological connectivity, and showing that there is a mathematical similarity so they can share ideas, ” Hasty said.

bacteria can synchronize, which could be useful in pharmaceuticals.

By principle of perpetual stu-
dent brokeness, free food goes fast on any college cam-
pus. But much like drugs or alcohol, a complimentary slice of pizza is just as quickly consumed as its ori-gin is forgotten. 
That’s why, when the Grove 
busted open its doors and fed 2,200 hungry students at its grand reopening last week, it needed something more than a free teriyaki chicken sandwich to turn a line full of deal seekers into loyal, coffee-tot-ing Groveheads. It needed branding and professionalism.
Not that serving up $6,000 
worth of free meals — funded by 
A.S. Council in an attempt to pull 
the struggling coffeehouse out of its $140,000 debt — was a poor attempt at forming a fan base. Had the effort been pulled off properly, it might have even charmed stu-dents into visiting the Grove on a regular basis. But unfortunately, the execution of the Grove’s weeklong free-for-all — like its BBQ chicken 
pizzas — was half-baked. 
In business, first impressions make or break you. When there 
are no giant banners or balloons to remind students where they got their free food, they won’t remem-ber. When coupons are printed on cheap printouts rather than glossy, colorful paper, they’ll be crumpled and forgotten in a book bag. When meals are served on flimsy paper plates and customers herded through a line like cattle, 
nothing will stop us from deeming 
the Grove a slow, out-of-the-way cafeteria.
True, part of the Grove’s unsuc-
cessful presentation lies fault to the business’s obscure location and maze-like setup, but we can’t help but wonder why a little bit more thought wasn’t put into the whole thing.
If it’s a matter of money — 
though it hardly is when A.S. Council is your personal sugar daddy — the Grove could’ve cut one day of free food to fund some snazzy decorations. Or it could have saved money by actually tracking who had already received a free meal (rather than allow hungry stu-dents to come back for fourths). 
Even if employees didn’t have 
time to add some supplementary sparkle, they could have at least cleared the old equipment out of the indoor lounge and clearly labeled it as part of the cafe. We’re not asking for trendy Loft-like furnishing, just a clean, professional environment that gives customers some hint at what the Grove’s all about.
All complaints about aesthetics 
aside, it seems the Grove is strug-gling with something much more 
basic: providing quick service and 
tasty meals. A week after the grand opening hubbub, a couple editorial board members returned to observe the coffeehouse in action. Some members were served quickly, but weren’t impressed with the food. Another waited a half-hour for their sandwich and witnessed a slew of order mistakes, one of which result-
ed in a frustrated costumer ask-
ing for his money back and leav-ing with nothing. This all while a Grove employee was indulging in his own sandwich behind the counter.If a staff of four can’t sort out a 
few sandwich orders, it seems this $6,000 grand reopening might have been premature, if not all for noth-ing. 
It’s obvious Grove Student 
Manager Thomas Frank hasn’t thought out an efficient opera-tions system to prepare for the foot traffic he hoped the Grove would gain. And if he can’t shape up on this front, it won’t be long until the Grove has pissed off enough people that it’s right back where it started.
It doesn’t matter how alternative 
a student-run business is; if a hun-gry student has to wait 30 minutes 
for a mediocre sandwich during 
his lunch break, next time he’ll just go to Subway. There’s no doubt that will happen. The real question is: How much more will the A.S. Council shell out to save the Grove next time?

I am navigationally retarded. 
Street signs mean nothing 
to me. I have never success-
fully operated a compass. When 
confronted with a road map, it takes me roughly 45 minutes to figure out where I am, by which point I’m usually somewhere else. While driving home for winter break last month, I missed my freeway exit and ended up in Sacramento — a full 90 miles past my destination. Three weeks later, on my first night in Washington, DC, I went out in search of a 7-Eleven and nearly suc-cumbed to hypothermia after some-how ending up on the east bank of the Potomac River, halfway across town. 
I’m not dumb, I swear. I just hap-
pen to have been born with a sense of direction slightly worse than that of a senile chimpanzee.  It shames me to admit it, but without the aid of my cellphone’s  built-in GPS func-
tion, I probab
ly would have died on 
some dark city street a long time ago, my moonlit corpse surrounded by crumpled MapQuest printouts and an absurd number of taquito wrappers. 
Naturally, the phrase “Where am 
I?” occurs with great frequency in my daily vocabulary. Sometimes I ask strangers. Most of the time, I ask myself. When I’m really desperate I call my dad and ask him — a ques-tion typically met by an elongated description of my latent idiocy, fol-lowed by a brief set of instructions on how to get back to my apartment from the Starbucks around the cor-ner. 
“ Are you stupid, son?”“No, Dad, I’m just navigationally 
retarded. ”
After 22 years of this, I know a 
lot about being lost. I know what it’s like to wonder why they built a big fence around Los Angeles before realizing you’ve driven to the Mexican border. I know the feeling you get after wandering around the international terminal at SFO for half an hour only to learn that a trip to San Diego falls under the cat-
egory o f “
domestic flights. ” I know 
how much it sucks to miss the first half of a movie because you spent 40 minutes running back and forth between Sears and Sbarro in a des-perate attempt to find the theatre, all the while being loudly ridiculed by a group of Hispanic teenag-ers hanging out in front of Pacific 
Sunwear. 
I know what it’ s like to be dis-
oriented, perplexed, hopelessly off 
course. If I was a bird, I’ d be one of those birds that flies into  a window. 
Had I been b o
rn to a 19th century 
American frontier family, I would have been disowned immediately after puberty because I wouldn’t be able to track bison worth shit. 
Though the ability to kill slow-
moving animals doesn’t hold the same kind of weight that it used to, all of this still makes me tre-mendously nervous for the next six months of my life. Y ou see, between now and June I have to figure out );][\IQVIJTM

It’s almost not worth it to keep 
talking about the recently pro-posed changes to the A.S. Media 
Guidelines, drafted last week by four absentminded councilmembers with a penchant to make yet another aspect of student life an administration-tamed bore.
At the embarrassing public forum 
last Tuesday, a host of skeptical coun-cilmembers and angry representatives from student publications turned up 
to mouth off about the restricting nature of the drafted guidelines.
Thing is, everyone 
who took a turn at the podium soon realized they were preaching to the choir. The guidelines 
sucked, and the only person who didn’t think so was one-man-army Associate Vice President Student Organizations Andrew Ang — the “brains” behind the new legislation, and supposed rep-resentative of all student-org interests on campus (even though not a single one expressed inter-est in receiving university sponsorship, as Ang pro-posed).Even his three accomplices in 
writing up the new rules deserted him on the battlefield. At a certain point, it was painful to watch. Campuswide Senator Adam Kenworthy admitted that the proposal to require content guidance by a faculty member — which comprised the entire first half of the draft — didn’t reflect student interests, and was kind of just lame in general. Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey cowered the entire time, and man-aged to escape without saying a word. Then there was Marshall Senator Brian McEuen — oh wait, no there wasn’t. Dude was so scared he didn’t even show up.
Makes you wonder how much 
time the committee spent in conver-sation, when only a single member now stands by its final decisions. (And at this point, even Ang probably

wants to take it all back. But he’s 
probably better off looking like a fascist administrator-loving asshole than admitting he did the whole thing to get rid of the Koala , and 
doesn’t actually care about the vast improve-ment in “quality” that university oversight would allegedly have on student newspapers.)
In the end, there’s 
no denying the glar-ing crappiness of much student media at UCSD. When spell-check is waived, graphics are credited to the “Internet” and Muslims are depicted as monkeys in diapers by right-wing publica-tions with no history of irony, one certainly hopes the Communicatons majors in the pro-duction room aren’t putting this on their resume.
But the mere fact that fellow stu-
dents  — like, presumably halfway-
cool young people — would think it was a good idea to self-importantly make up more rules  that would 
unleash an old person on the cre-
ative process, possibly affecting the hilarious effects (if only hilari-ously bad) on the outcome, makes us wonder whether the council’s really a band of administrators in disguise.
Student newspapers are awe-
some because they don’t come out on time, their offices have more empty beer cans than computers and their editors mostly just want the title to improve their chances of getting laid. Since when did we not fight the man in solidarity? 
Even the second half of the pro-posal, which lays out a new way of reviewing funds for student publi-cations, contains obvious lapses in judgment. The current system — the Student Organization Funding Advisory Board (SOFAB) — already 
suffers from inefficiencies.
Instead of just com-
piling a list of standard printing and publication costs and referring to it when the organization in question happens to pro-duce media, Ang and his committee proposed creat-ing a whole new group of student politicians to com-plicate an inherently ques-tionable process. The new board would also include two representatives from student newspapers on campus, obviously allow-ing for rivalries between 
publications to air themselves in the boardroom, and potentially affect funding.
A.S. President Utsav Gupta may 
have shelved the new media guide-lines indefinitely at the council’s meeting last night, but the council can’t erase this. The A.S. Council reputation sank to its low of the year this week, thanks to the badly thought-out, fun-killing whims of an out-of-touch few. 
When dealing with the his-
toric UCSD free-speech issue and, particularly, the Koala , the AVP 
Student Organizations should know his every move has to be flawless. Instead, Ang’s media guideline changes blatantly proposed content regulation and biased funding, and made any future attempt to sneakily change the guidelines traceable to an initial bias against offensive con-tent (read: the Koala  making fun of 
dead people). Good one, guys.how to be a grown-up. I have to fig-ure out how to fend for myself, how to hold a job, how to shop at Home Depot and read bestselling novels and appear intriguing  to women. 
I have  t
o figure out how to drink 
cocktails and talk about car insur-ance, how to buy drapes and invest in mutual funds and make food without a panini press.
According to my guidance 
counselor, my parents and a lot of other middle-aged people with back problems, I have to plot a course, choose a path, head toward some pre-determined goal. My propensity for wandering unknowingly in the wrong direction for extended peri-ods of time surely isn’t going to help out a whole lot.  It might even land 
me somew
here terrible, like prison, 
or drug rehab or middle manage-
ment. 
Fo
rtunately I get the feeling that 
this is exactly the type of confu-sion about 90 percent of my peers are suffering from at this very moment. We’re all about to set out on our own, to navigate haphazardly through this treacherous 21st-centu-ry landscape. We’re rocking violently back and forth on the brink of total independence, painfully aware of our impending responsibilities but large-ly unwilling to accept the horrifying prospect of full-blown adulthood. 
What’ s worse, most of us aren’t really sure how to get there. After roughly two decades of homework, soccer practice, standardized tests, ready-made dinners and extensive amounts of hand holding, it’s going to be tough to find  our bearings. 
Those of us no t alr
eady committed 
to graduate school — the educa-tional equivalent of breast feeding — will likely wander blindly into the void, our resumes pinned to our coats and a steady stream of snot flowing from our noses.
All I know is I’m going to keep 
my dad on speed dial.

The A.S.Councilreputationsank to its low of the yearthis week, thanks to the badly thought-out, fun-killing whims of an out-of-touch few.By Rebecca Erbe 
Contributing Writer
In an era of filmmaking where any halfwit can 
deduce a movie’s entire plot from a single teaser trailer, it’s a refreshing to learn that “44 Inch 
Chest” is not at all it seems. Especially after its pre-view, an “Ocean’s Eleven” master-plan prototype  with 
a predictable sense of wit, made it out to be a token dark comedy. 
In fact, freshman director Malcolm Venville 
knows exactly what kind of film it is; he just won’t tell us right away. Ray Winstone (“The Departed”) shines as Colin, a man whose life is left in pieces after his wife informs him she’s leaving their 21-year marriage to run away with another man.
While he’s shocked with distraught, Colin’s friends 
whip out a surefire plan: kidnap his wife’s lover so Colin can exact his revenge. 
It’s up to his motley crew — Meredith (Ian 
McShane), the gay, smarmy swindler; Archie (Tom 
Wilkinson), who still lives with his mom; and Peanut (John Hurt), the homophobic old-timer — to do the deed. As a safety net for a cuckolded Colin, the trio gives him an outlet for his grief: a bottle or two of brandy  and one fettered Frenchman. That’s what 
friends are for, right?
Winstone is the gem of the film.  Though he wears 
the hard exterior of a man long burdened by brutish labor, he often collapses with heartwrenching grief, delivering lines like “Love is a garden, and you have to weed it to keep it beautiful” with cheeseless sincer-ity. He earns our sympathy again and again, only to 
toss it aside as Colin’s dark inner turmoil rises to the 
surface, fearlessly warding 
us off with his black and deadened stare.
Venville keeps the 
film — a manifestation of Colin’s rolling emotions — from tipping into one stock genre or another. The main character is too dark to be comedic, his gang too 
cavalierly oddball for the 
serious crime genre and 
the setting too singular for an action flick. “Chest” is the definition of successful anti-formula — surpris-ing us from fade in to fade out, never waxing forced or contrived. Just try to guess what happens next.

But it’s a more natural fit than one might 
think. According to Dubstep at UCSD 
founder and engineering grad student David Gross, the scene’s diehards are dirt-styled twentysomethings loitering on the introspec-tive fringe of dance culture, shying from LED lasers, happy pills and the sweaty rave grind. UCSD introverts, rejoice: Y ou can get out of your molding dorm rooms for a night and still be perfectly antisocial. Because it’s built on a woozy 2step rhythm, moving to dub is a noncontact sport with a hoodie/headphone uniform.  
Gross is optimistic that student interest in 
his cause will snowball until we’ve got our-selves a mini dubstep scene on campus — to a degree that could rival the Che Cafe of yesteryear. And it does seem the base is there: On the same Saturday that Let’s Bounce — UCSD’s most popular deejay event — went down in the Price Center Ballrooms, dubstep “brainfeeder” Nosaj Thing managed to draw a faster and more committed crowd to the Loft next door. The kids apparently got so hyped that one pulled a fire alarm (either that or a fun-killing security guard wanted to flush the hordes from Price Center and do a recount — if you’re the conspiracy-theory type).
The venue’s coordinators, according to 
Gross, didn’t let Nosaj set up the woofers he needed for the maximum bass experience. And, as any true dubhead can tell you, the beat is nothing if not rattling the phlegm from your most neglected alveoli. 
“I’ve been to shows where you literally 
couldn’t breathe, ” Gross said. “Dubstep is definitely not for people with pre-existing heart conditions. ”
Now, thanks to the electronic Dome at 
Coachella, UCSD has a student org devoted to womping on the weekly. It was in the Dome, where they ran the beat run until 4 a.m., that Gross first discovered his love for the dubstep culture. He then spent the summer getting whirlwinded into the LA scene — rivaled only by that in England and New Y ork, Gross said — hopping between word-of-mouth ware-house shows and even systems set up in movie theaters. (In the seated environment, the show can be all about the visuals, he said. And, of course, the vibrations.)
By the end of last quarter, Gross and seven 
of his friends had materialized a plan to rec-reate the dizzying LA dubstep vibe here at UCSD. But as soon as the thousands of fliers for their first show at Porter’s Pub went up in Price Center three weeks ago, Gross said the administration started asking questions, trying to “roadblock” the club by mandating expen-sive university equipment and security guards.
“They charge like $800 for a fog machine 
and a bunch of lights, ” Gross said.
The club relegated all questions to Stephen 
Lawler, owner of the Pub (who’s more used to getting university admin off his back), and set a determined tunnel vision on gathering dee-jays and equipment for that night’s show.
“We were like pushing 200-pound speak-
ers across the school on dollies, ” Gross said. “We didn’t even have a microphone until the very end. ”
And they would rather work that way — 
descending upon the unsuspecting students in a bass explosion, creating a sort of flash audio-mob that can’t be traced nor prepared for. Frustrated with the time-consuming pro-cess of applying for A.S. funds, the club has even bypassed that opportunity for a more spontaneous, you-find-a-needle, I’ll-get-an-emcee approach. The sound system, for instance, is currently being borrowed from a guy named Juan from East County.
“He’s just some guy we met, ” Gross said. 
“Some guy with a ton of speakers. ”
The club’s motto is “Experience Audio 
Thunder. ” Unfortunately, chill as the Pub may be, its rickety plywood frame is no match for that kind of loud. At last Tuesday’s Dub at the Pub show — sadly underattended due to the rain (though I guess that only makes it more underground) — every nail in the place was all but buzzing out of its socket, absorbing all that good, warm worminess before it could find its way into our chest cavities.
That’s why Gross is hoping Mike Gao, a 
graduate student in the music department equally committed to the dubstep cause (he does the visuals and helps recruit guests for the Dub at the Pub shows), could one day convince the UCSD academics to give the stuff a listen. Just imagine, Gross said, all that perfect rhythm allowed to ruminate in a prac-tice room at the Conrad Prebys Music Center.
Before the scientists realize its power and 
it flies the underground forever, get in on this shit. It’s happening this instant, and if you’re not here, you’ll miss it. So find your way to the Pub next Tuesday evening — there’s eight dirt-styled twentysomethings there who want to show you the dub.

A slew of bumbling characters aid in fraud-filled mission, leaving even Lucrezia’s husband, his mother, a priest and a local pimp to reap the benefits of the unlikely union.

‘LETHAL’ COMEBACK
High-Octane Gibson Pardons DUI With Hospital-Gurney Showdown
By Matthew Pecot
Associate Hiatus Editor
After 20 years of DUIs, anti-Semitic rants 
and novels worth of Mayan subtitles, Mel Gibson has finally given us what we 
really wanted: “Lethal Weapon 5. ”
Except it’s called “Edge of Darkness, ” 
and it’s based on a BBC miniseries. But the setup’s so similar to work by sequel-happy “Weapon” director Richard Donner that you could recycle his trailers. Cue creature-from-the-deep announcer guy: “Mel Gibson just lost his family. He’s a cop on the edge. And he’ll break every rule in the book in the name of justice. ” 
And because we’re a hopelessly nostalgic 
society, more of the same is exactly what we crave.
By the 10-minute mark, Emma Craven 
(Bojana Novakovic) has been gunned down — but everyone thinks the bullet was meant for her father, Thomas Craven (Gibson). However, she started puking up blood before getting shot. What gives?
So Thomas starts kicking down doors to 
figure out why someone killed his daughter. An old CIA operative who’s tired of cover-ups (Ray Winstone)  points him in the right 
direction, and the two rack up an impressive body count along the way.  But before we get 
to the action, Thomas spends about 15 min-utes grieving — too bad Mad Max can’t cry. It never reaches George Lucas levels of inept sentimentality, but Gibson’s no better at doing sad than Keanu Reeves. We didn’t pay 10 bucks for a crying Australian; if you’ d wanted that, we’ d have reminded Hugh Jackman that he starred in “X-Men Origins: Wolverine. ”  
“Edge”  is an action thriller, with fast and 
dirty fight scenes as viciously sharp as Gibson’s mullet days (think “Bourne” with-out the Handycam). Get ready for knife fights, shootouts, and even a few holy-shit moments. They might be completely irrel-evant to the plot, but what are we here for if not an adrenaline rush, anyway?
Don’t tell Gibson that. He’s collaborated 
with director Martin Campbell and producer Michael Wearing to make what he thinks is a politically charged thriller that draws on fears of a reactionary-right takeover and the environmentalist Gaia hypothesis.
This may have come across in the six-hour 
BBC miniseries, but if Gibson’s track record is any indication, an exact replication would have bred a pretentious monster of a film. 
Luckily, we’re spared any Steven Segal 
moral-of-the-story monologues, and the script’s dry wit keeps the film snappy when the tension eases up. The only prob-lem is that most characters are Bostonian 
— accents included.Seamless cinematogra-phy is definitely the film’s high point, but we only notice when our eyes can no longer stand the sight of Gibson attempting to appear mournful.
“Darkness” certainly 
isn’t a spectacular film — the detective-thriller bits 
are riddled with plot holes — but at the end of the day, it’s fun. And it feels damn good to toss all judgments aside and thoroughly enjoy a Mel Gibson film again.  
Charlotte Gainsbourg
IRM
ELEKTRA
Her face and name may be packaged right in with her whis-
pery, evocative vocals, but for some reason I’m not convinced that IRM 
is Charlotte Gainsbourg’s album. Does the album’s creative credit belong to this beautiful chanteuse , or 
to Beck — the American alt-legend who actually produced and wrote the entire album? 
It’s hard to believe 
the former, as Beck’s Sea 
Change wail permeates nearly every track. From 
the orchestration of “Le 
Chat Du Café Des Artistes” to the rumbling “Trick Pony, ” most instrumenta-tion sounds right off Beck’s Modern Guilt .
It’ s almost as if 
Gainsbourg is simply play-ing the part of a singer in a film. The acclaimed actress, 
who most recently starred in 
the disturbing “ Antichrist, ” does pull off a memorable performance on the album, but Charlotte isn’t trying to win an Oscar here; she’s supposedly crafting intel-ligent pop.
Instead, she leaves that 
job to a more talented man and contents herself with the responsibility of the muse — something she no doubt picked up from her own parents, Jane Birkin and infamous French pedo-phile Serge Gainsbourg. 
Though allusions to such 
legendary collaborations like her parents are evident — especially in “Heaven Can Wait” , the playful duet between her and Beck — Gainsbourg can’t seem to 
find a sound that’s distinctly 
her own. As a result, IRM  
is essentially a Beck album with female vocals.
But hell, it just might 
be the best Beck album in years — and it’s certainly Gainsbourg’s best yet.

Strong Arm Steady
In Search of Stoney Jackson
BLACKSMITH
California natives Strong Arm Steady combine with Stones Throw prophet 
Madlib for In Search of Stoney 
Jackson . With a super-alliance 
between World Famous Beat Junkie J Rocc, emcee heavy-weights Talib Kweli, Phonte 
and a host of no-names, 
Jackson  shapes up to be a killer 
Cali classic in the press release 
— but the final product is a slightly different story. 
SAS rappers Krondon, Phil da Agony and Mitchy Slick were handed a platter of J Rocc’s 200 finest recipes for their soundtrack, with Madlib in the producer’s seat, and everything starts out promis-ing. “Best of Times” lays down a chunky bass-guitar groove atop a one-two snare ‘n’ bass 
beat — all wrung together with a high-to-low synth progres-sion. The syrupy melody is complemented by Phonte’s expertise: “Got workers losing they jobs and they residence/ And overseas niggaz filin’ out, straight wildin’ out/ Throwin’ they shoes at the President. ”  
“Cheeba Cheeba” starts 
with finger snaps over dull bass and distorted Motown violin, and Krondon whimsically attempts to forecast another Acid Raindrops : “ All my niggaz 
smoke Swishers/ Like old men playing Checkers on a park bench like Bobby Fisher. ”  Y eah, 
that’s exactly  what it feels like. 
Madlib pays service to Dilla 
on “Chittlins & Pepsi, ” a feel-good funk romp painted with trumpet, chopped violin  and a 
breezy harmonized chorus  — 
something that would fit right in on Donuts . This golden-age 
inspiration continues into “Get Started, ” a head-bumping gem of a jam, reminiscent of Jazzy Jeff ’s “Summertime. ” Piano and hi-hat rush through high-speed clashes as Talib Kweli shines over his West Coast counterparts: “We takin’ over back to work like my break is over/ Next up Steady Arms and Hammers like baking soda. ”  
“True Champs” is an old-
school triumph — a rousing, orchestral sample cut into pieces across a timeless stac-cato loop. But it’s butchered by Krondon’s rhyme schemes: “When opportunity knocks I invite him in/ My flow is hard 
to swallow like a vitamin. ” 
Stoney Jackson ’s mediocrity can 
be summed up in “Bark Like a Dog, ” a bass drum-heavy head-ache topped off by an appall-ing chorus and chaotic guitar sample.
There are lots of nice rea-
sons to like Jackson , but that’s 
its problem: It never supersedes that. Beats loosen necks,  but 
never break them, and guest emcees prove more listenable than the SAS crew itself. It should be judged as an ensem-ble piece, even if it is no greater than the sum of its parts.

Mr Hudson
Straight No Chaser
GOOD MUSIC
We all know a Mr 
Hudson: He’s that dorky high-school kid 
who always manages to slip the F-bomb into songs just to show us how cool he is. 
It doesnt work. In fact, 
Straight No Chaser’s  melan-
cholic lyrics make him seem more like a wimpy emo kid. 
Not to write him off 
completely. This skinny Brit may have just dropped the first emo hip-hop album, and it’s not half bad. Straight No 
Chaser is an eclectic mix of beats and genres: He mixes synth-heavy hooks with that classic hip-hop beat. He sings on some tracks, raps on oth-ers and is sensitive on every one.
Y ou won’t find songs about 
nasty-ass bitches and hoes in No Chaser. Instead, you’ll be dragged into Hudson’s world of commercial heartache, each song artificially sad like the careful placement of every hole on those “grungy” jeans that cost you $300.
On first single 
“Supernova, ” Hudson wails about being a lonely bloke who’s bummed that everyone “got all the things I thought I wanted. ” He continues with “White Lies, ” berating himself for self-deception, and even the title track — ostensibly an anthem to how well a cool guy can hold his liquor — turns out to be about drinking alone to drown the pain. 
The constant pity party is 
wearing, but it’s got a finesse that gets us moving nonethe-less. Hudson may have the weepiest lyrics in the game, but add some sticky beats, plaintive vocals and icy synths, and you’ve got genre-defying innovation.
 “Supernova” drones us 
with insistent bass, thudding drums and buzzing electron-ics to turn breakup lament into a midtempo dance gem.
“White Lies” brings us 
pop a la Mika. Here, Hudson’s high-pitched rendition of “lie-e-ai-e-ai” is imposed over complex instrumentation and sprinkled with tinkling piano and whispery vocals to build a grand chorus.
Bottom line: Straight No 
Chaser’s powerful sonic illu-sion helps us forget Hudson never stops whining about this or that. His repetitive beats and alarm-clock beeps even mesmerize us enough to believe — for a very brief moment — that he really is the baddest boy on the block.

Beach House 
Teen Dream
SUB POP
It’s high time Baltimore twosome  Beach House 
earned some props for 
their lilting dream pop, and Teen Dream feels like their breakout LP . While Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally’s self-titled debut and 2008 followup Devotion  rode a 
dependably mellow niche of murmuring melodies and quiet keys, their third album (and first with Sub Pop) is a switch like when TV went Technicolor. 
Their first records’ ever-
present coyness and mys-tique is traded in for ambi-tion and overt balladry this time around, starting right away with the harmonizing “Zebra. ” The track slowly gains momentum with plaintive finger-picked guitar, layering synths as Legrand’s smoky declara-tions ground the Baroque anthem. “ Any way you run, you run before us/ Black and white horse, arching among us, ” she croons, pulling each syllable from her lips like embedded thorns. 
Then the duo shifts into 
“Silver Soul, ” Beach House’s first late-night cruising cut with an accentuated, pop-heavy beat just begging to be remixed. This near-per-fect first half of the album continues with the angelic shoegaze of “Norway, ” the staccato choir coos and a slide guitar jangles, reach-ing a bliss that could infect at gigantic festivals and intimate halls. 
The rest of Teen Dream  
blurs just like the opening trifecta, a series of singles that, at times, evokes Stereolab’s electro-lounge, Sally Shapiro’s minimal disco and oddly jaunty source material in the pre-viously released cut, “Used to Be. ” 
That track’s cheesy 
bounce and theatric indul-gence is definitely the LP’s low point — but then “Lover of Mine” regains its refined tastes in a Feist-like, nearly R&B jam with reverb and smooth beats galore.Beach House’s boy and girl, like friends Grizzly Bear, have honed absurdly tasteful indie styles to absolute effect, and while the results may not be musically ground-breaking, Teen Dream is 
too love-drunk on its own beauty to care.

The Magnetic Fields
Realism
NONESUCH
With the release of their tenth album, the Magnetic Fields dig up synth-pop 
roots to embrace a more earthy theme. Unfortunately, their new hokey folk lacks the tradition to ring true.
Mostly acoustic, the album 
is a thoughtful hodgepodge of various types of country, filled with vocalist Stephen Meritt’s semi-witty musings. Tracks like “We Are Having A Hootenanny” make us wonder whether the album was record-ed on the set of “Oklahoma!” , while the melodic, plucked-key “The Dolls’ Tea Party” reminds us of our favorite (or most-hated) nursery rhyme. 
The collection of slow 
mountain ballads starts out promising, reminiscent of Paul Simon and Conor Oberst, but slowly veer sinto an attempt at intellectual complication — one that’s just plain nonsensical on “Y ou Must Be Out of Y our Mind. ” (“I want you crawl-ing back to me down on your knees, yeah/ Like an appendec-tomy sans anesthesia. ”)
High points are whenever 
twangy country instruments — including specimen like the banjo, accordion and autoharp — make an appearance on the track. Our ears perk at Beach Boy throwback “The Dada Polka, ” one of the record’s few playfully upbeat numbers. But the dapper beach ballad goes sour next to the Fields’ overam-bitious hillbilly experiment.

dollar deficit, Ahmed said. “So they are 
looking at other ways of financing these 
programs. And because we don’t have the money to finance all these different tracks and programs, there is a need to cut in some places. This may be the best way to do it. ” 
Elman said that the budget cuts will 
most likely negatively impact the faculty-to-student ratio in social science courses.
“The current budget crisis is clearly 
a problem and has consequences for structure because we’re going to have fewer faculty teaching the same or more students, ” Elman said.
He said that simplifying major 
requirements gives faculty more flexibility by eliminating a certain track’s course requirement, allowing them to teach a wider variety of subjects.
For instance, instead of being obligated 
to teach a series of classes for the anthropology track, a faculty member can branch out, and choose from a variety of subjects.
“If something new happens, you can 
teach a course and students can take that course, ” Elman said. “I think it allows for more innovation. ”
Though the cuts would affect faculty-
to-student ratios, Elman said that the proposal would also have some positive effects students in the social sciences. 
“One of the consequences of having 60 
required units is it really constrains what the students can do, ” he said. “It locks them in. Now, if you have lots and lots of faculty and can guarantee you are teaching all 
these courses all the time, it may not be so 
bad. ”
However, Ahmed said that decreasing 
the number of course tracks would provide less choices for students. 
“The beauty of college in itself is being 
able to have options, and being able to have options means not having to take certain classes you really don’t enjoy, ” Ahmed said. “ And because you are forced to only take 
certain tracks and these are your only options, 
obviously you don’t have as much diversity. ”Under this proposal, a task force of 
department chairs and administrators would decide specific changes within the various social science departments. Possible departments that will be affected, other than political science and international studies, include cognitive science, anthropology, psychology, sociology, linguistics, ethnic studies and urban planning.
Ahmed announced the proposal to 
A.S. Council because he would students to be represented in the decision-making process.
“We want to make sure our voices are 
heard while these issues are being made, because many times they are not made in the presence of us, ” Ahmed said.
Lauren Lagano, a Muir College 
sophomore and international studies major, is currently studying anthropology and sociology, two of the seven specialized tracks in the international studies program. She said the proposal to reduce the tracks is restrictive to students.  
“I think it’s limiting what I can do well 
here at UCSD, ” Lagano said. “If politics and economics were the only two tracks you could pick, I definitely wouldn’t be that major. I don’t do well in econ, and I really don’t like politics, so I’m looking for more of the anthro and socio-cultural aspects of 
it because that’s what I enjoy. ” 
Changing major requirements is a 
bureaucratic process that can take up to two 
years. It usually takes six to nine months for faculty within a department to review their curriculum and discuss changes before forming a proposal, according to Elman. The Committee on Educational  Policy — a group affiliated with A.S. Council — takes an additional three to five months to 
review the proposal.
Elman said that if the major tracks are 
consolidated, current students studying 
these tracks will still be able to complete their major and the changes would only affect new students.

Honors thesis 2009.For their following match on Friday 
night, the Tritons traveled to Galen 
Center in Los Angeles, home to No. 1 University of Southern California. Unfortunately for the Tritons, they were defeated 30-24, 30-24, 30-21 in three straight sets,. Fritsch led the way with 16 kills, six digs and three blocks. Ross contributed five kills on .308 hit-ting and four blocks. USC hit at .349, while UCSD hit at .190.
The Trojans also bettered the 
Tritons in digs, with 40 to UCSD’s 28.
USC started the first set with a 
quick 4-0 lead that UCSD was unable to close, resulting in USC’s 30-24 first-set win. The Trojans hit at .333 in the initial set, while the Tritons hit at .195. In the second set, the Tritons led 14-11 before their opponents fought back, scoring five consecutive points and then rounding out the set with seven of the last nine points.
In the final set, USC picked up an 
early 3-0 lead and ended the set 30-21, while hitting .417. Junior outside hit-ter Joel Davidson added six kills and Spangler five for UCSD.
“USC is a very good serving team 
with a variety of serves, so that really got us out of sync, ” Ring said.
The Tritons returned to action 
with a win in their first home game of the season against Princeton on Wednesday, Jan. 27 at RIMAC Arena.

The Saints enter the Super Bowl 
with all these intangibles on their side. The story seems as if it’s writ-ten: This game — the last chapter in a 2009 season — will be titled something catchy like “When the Saints Came Marching in” or “ All Saints’ Day” by the witty NFL Films narrators.
Maybe a storyline backed by 
chance and karma doesn’t seem to measure up to things like a superior defense or a more confident quar-terback on the field — upper hands with which the Colts will enter Super Bowl XLIV on Feb. 7. 
Sometimes chemistry mat-
ters, as was showcased when the New England Patriots pulled off their now-famed Super Bowl upset against the more polished and potent St. Louis Rams. Sometimes it’s about a transcendent leader who rallies everyone around him — as was the case when John Elway led the Broncos to a win in Super Bowl XXXII. Other times, the game sim-ply goes to the better team. That’s what happened when the Patriots won their last two championships, 
and when Elway and Co. won their second of two titles against the Falcons.
In terms 
of on-field performance, Indianapolis might not have scored as many points as the Saints, but the team has shown the ability to adjust quickly 
mid game. On special teams, the Colts don’t have an explosive return man like Reggie Bush, but have 
a steadier kicker in Matt Stover. 
Neither team has a great defense, but the Colts have more of a defen-sive identity than the Saints, who need to improve in this department if they are serious about  winning the big game. 
With what has been shown dur-
ing the season and playoffs so far, the Colts should win. That’s why they’re favored. But the Saints have something fantastically intangible in their favor. Their storyline is in need of a climax to play respect to the events that have taken them this far. Football doesn’t matter as much as the city of New Orleans itself, but it helps people take their minds off of more sobering realities. Sometimes everyone needs a distraction from the bigger picture.
Predictions are usually wrong. 
But if you’re going to put yourself out there, no matter how much you think it through, you always got to go with that intangible something — the gut.

Co-captain Stephanie Heinrich 
said she felt the game against San Diego State was a learning experi-ence for the team before heading into the match against Michigan.
“We came out and showed off 
what we worked on, ” Heinrich said. “We saw where we made mis-takes and how to fix them against Michigan. ”
The next day, UCSD fell 6-15 
sixth-ranked San Jose State University. The Spartans took a com-manding lead of 7-1 by the first quar-ter. The Tritons could only muster six goals: three from Heinrich, one from senior attacker Audra Bloom, one from senior utility player Stephanie Bocian and the last from freshman attacker Kim McComas. 
In the final game against No. 3 
UCLA, the Tritons competed even-ly  with the Bruins early on. UCSD took a 2-1 lead in the first quarter and trailed by only one at halftime. However, the Bruins took a firm command in the second half of the game, ultimately emerging with a 10-4 victory. 
Despite the loss to UCLA, 
Kreutzkamp felt the performance was his team’s best of the tourna-
ment, because players were able to familiarize themselves with their contributing roles on the team and gain confidence as a group. 
“Playing against such competitive 
teams, the team responded remark-ably well, ” Kreutzkamp said. “We just need to continue doing our best and continue to set the right tone to reach the championships. ”
The Tritons return to action at the 
two-day Triton Invitational tourna-ment, where they will host a field of 16 teams at the Canyonview Aquatic Center from Feb. 6 to Feb. 7.

TRITONS RIDE WAVES IN MALIBU
MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — On Jan. 20, the 12th-
ranked UCSD men’s volleyball team pulled off a historic feat: The Tritons defeated No. 7 Pepperdine University 33-31, 30-28, 23-30, 30-25 at Firestone Fieldhouse.
This victory was the team’s first over national 
powerhouse Pepperdine, after 37 matches in over 21 years. However, on Jan. 22, the Tritons lost momentum in over three sets against No. 1 University of Southern California. Their overall record now stands at 2-5, 1-3 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
In the first set against Pepperdine, the Tritons 
scored the first three points. Their largest lead came at 24-20; however, Pepperdine fought back with a late push to lead 27-26.
The Waves took two chances at set point, but 
both were met with a UCSD point. The Tritons also had two set point opportunities, and man-aged to convert the second attempt.
Junior outside hitter Will Ehrman’s seventh 
kill in the first set gave UCSD a 32-31 lead, before junior setter Phil Bannan’s kill sealed the team’s 33-31 win.
The second set consisted of a seesaw battle for 
the lead. After the last tie at 14-14, senior opposite hitter Frank Fritsch pushed UCSD to a 15-14 lead. Fritsch’s 11th kill of the match and a Pepperdine error extended UCSD’s lead to 28-24. The oppo-nents came close to completing a comeback, drawing within a point at 29-28 — but Ehrman sealed the set with his ninth kill of the match for a 30-28 victory.
In the third set, the Waves took an early 4-1 
lead, forcing the Tritons to call an early timeout. UCSD recovered to come within two points, at 13-15, thanks to blocks by Ehrman and fresh-man middle blocker Cyrus Kiani, but Pepperdine pushed to extend its lead to 18-13 and ultimately sealed the set 30-23.
The Tritons started off the fourth set with a 
10-5 lead, prompting the Waves to call an early timeout. UCSD then extended its lead to 16-11 from a Fritsch kill and a solo block by junior middle blocker Adrian Gunthals.
Pepperdine fought back hard, making a come-back to squeeze UCSD’s lead to two points at 17-15. It was the Tritons turn to call a timeout.
The Waves cut the Tritons’ lead to a single 
point on multiple occasions throughout the rest of the match, but the Tritons earned consecutive points with a Bannan kill and block by junior middle blocker Calvin Ross, carrying their lead to 27-24.
Punctuated by Ehrman’s 13th kill in the match, 
UCSD went on to score the final three points of the game, ending the set 30-25.
“Overall, we felt that we could run our offense, ” 
head coach Kevin Ring said. “We sided-out well and multiple times, which was key. We did a nice job blocking in the match. ”
Fritsch and Spangler finished the match with 
20 and 19 kills, respectively. Ross added eight kills without an error, along with a team-high six blocks, and had a .667 hitting percentage. Bannan ended the night with 61 assists, six digs and four kills.
SeeVOLLEYBALL page 11By Jessy Jahangir  Staff writerIn postseason football, games go one of two ways. When two teams make the postseason, 
either the favorite team wins, or some crazy fluke lifts the underdog in ways that make Vegas bookies cry, and Rudy smile. It could be a turnover or a coaching error (as is usually the case when Norv Turner is involved), but sometimes, it’s something more. The kind of myste-rious upset that puts ESPN analysts to shame, and cannot be defined in a rulebook.
These are the forces that don’t 
show up in box scores and don’t earn points in fantasy leagues: leadership or chemistry, luck or destiny. The New Orleans Saints didn’t men-tion luck or destiny after their NFC Conference Championship. It was something everyone tip-toed around like a bimbo’s obvious new boob job: they pretended it never even hap-pened.
When the Indianapolis Colts 
handled the New Y ork Jets in the AFC Championship game, people credited their methodical comeback from 11 down. When the Saints won, people talked about how random aberrations kept giving them a fight-ing chance. Not too different from the mysterious forces that brought the Saints back to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina forced them to make a temporary home in San Antonio. These same forces con-spired to get Drew Brees in a Saints uniform, after he was close to sign-ing for Miami. 
During the game, New Orleans 
kept being gifted the ball. Sometimes the Saints made a great play on the ball, like forcing the fumble from Bernard Berrian. Sometimes it was something more inconceivable, like when Favre and Peterson couldn’t make a handoff near the end of the second quarter, and the Vikings lost the chance at a halftime lead.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — UCSD traveled to 
Ann Arbor, Mich., to open competitive play in the 2009-10 water polo season against a series of top-
10 nationally ranked, Division-I opponents at the 
two-day Michigan Invitational tournament, from Jan. 23 to Jan. 24.
Taking on four top programs in two days 
proved a difficult task for the Tritons: They lost their first four games of the season.
Heading into the tournament, the Tritons 
retained senior goalkeeper Markayla Quane, sophomore attacker Jessica Tran and senior utility players Stephanie Heinrich and Stephanie Bocian 
from last year’s team — all of whom were recently 
recognized as pre-season All-Americans by the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches.
According to head coach Brad Kreutzkamp, 
the meet provided the players a chance to see where they stood as a team, and to spot weak-nesses early on.
“The tournament gives a really good indica-
tion to where we need to strive toward because of the good level of competition, ” Kreutzkamp said.
In their first match of the tournament against 
No. 7 San Diego State University, the Tritons lost 8-19. UCSD fell behind early on while the Aztecs scored five goals, closing out the first quarter with a 5-1 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Tritons scored three times, but a 12-save effort from Quane was futile — San Diego State piled on five 
more goals to seal the win.
Tallying points for UCSD was sophomore 
two-meter Kirsten Bates with three goals and 
junior attacker Hanalei Crowell with two.
The Tritons returned to action against 
No. 10 University of Michigan later that day. Their defense showed improvement against the Wolverines, conceding eight goals fewer than against SDSU. On offense, Heinrich scored two goals at the two-meter point, and attacker Tran 
scored from five meters away. Although they ulti-Tritons struggle in
