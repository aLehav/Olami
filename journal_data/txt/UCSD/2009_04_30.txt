The A.S. Council’s decision last 
week to keep the Grove Caffe open 
was voided when the A.S. Judicial Board ruled Tuesday that the ver-dict was reached using incorrect procedure. 
Councilmembers voted against 
discontinuing Grove opera-tions under the assumption that a two-thirds majority was neces-
sary to approve the legislation. A.S. 
President Donna Bean immediately 
contested that only a simple major-ity should have been necessary.
Fifteen councilmembers voted 
in favor of the legislation, while 11 voted against it. A simple-majority voting system would have resulted in the  Grove’s closure.
The board reached its decision 
after reviewing Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised, the council’s primary document of parliamen-tary conduct. According to Judicial Board Chair Stephen Juarez, the vote should have depended only on a simple majority. The board has five days from its decision on Tuesday to release its official state-ment on the matter.
Given the option of reconsider-
ing the legislation at a meeting last night, councilmembers moved to table the revote until May 6 after a 
debate arose over the finality of the 
Judicial Board’s decision.

Although San Diego County 
health officials announced that more confirmed cases of swine flu should be expected within days, UCSD’s Student Health Services has not yet reported any incidences.
“We have been testing students 
who have flu symptoms as well as fever, and all have tested negative, ” SHS Medical Director Gina Fleming said.
On Wednesday, SHS stopped test-
ing students with mild flu symptoms in favor of testing only the seriously ill. Current precautions include put-ting students exhibiting flu symptoms in a separate area in the waiting room and providing them with masks to prevent the spread of germs. 
“The San Diego County Health 
Department has made the recom-mendation that we only test people who have symptoms so severe that we are considering hospitalizing them, ” Fleming said early Wednesday morn-ing.
SHS’s Urgent Care clinic saw an 
average number of student visitors Monday, but an unusually high per-centage reported having sore throats and colds, Fleming said.With five confirmed and 
three suspected cases in San Diego County, California declares a state of emergency.

Page 8:  Live review of Death Cab for Cutie, who played to a sold-out crowd at RIMAC Arena last 
night. The band recently released their fifth EP, The Open Door. Organized by the A.S. Programming 
Department, the concert also featured Cold War Kids and Ra Ra Riot.READON▶ ▶▶ ▶▶▶Don’t hold your breath.
After two years of picking through details, the commit-
tee tasked with updating UCSD’s 28-year-old policy on 
“speech, advocacy and distribution of literature” has once 
again postponed its deadline for completion. 
The committee first pushed the release of its draft from May 1 
to seventh week, due to lingering disagreements about phrasing. Then, earlier this week, vice chancellors Steven W . Relyea and Penny Rue instructed committee chair and Associate Controller Sally Brainerd to hold onto the policy until fall 2009, when a public input period will finally commence. 
Brainerd said the timeline would have dangerously resem-
bled that of a similar scenario in spring 2007. The speech-policy committee at the time, chaired by Sports Facilities Manager Don Chadwick, released a controversial policy proposal during finals week. The changes were sent campuswide in an e-mail titled “Review of PPM 510-1 Section IX. ”
It was met with immediate uproar from students and faculty 
who felt the administration was trying to sneak the restrictions past public review. The American Civil Liberties Union argued in a letter to the university that a whopping 10 aspects of the policy were unconstitutional, including a clause stating that any event or gathering that could “reasonably be expected to attract a crowd of 10 or more people” would require a reservation.
Benjamin Balthaser, Graduate Student Association representative 
on the current committee, was among those who participated in an emergency rally outside former Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph W . Watson’s office. Second-year John Vasquez dedicated www.
ucsdfreespeech.com  to keeping students informed about the policy.
According to Balthaser and committee member and Director of 
Student Policies and Judicial Affairs Tony Valladolid, there has been speculation that the controversial restrictions drafted by the first committee were partly in response to campus disruptions at the time, including antiabortion demonstrations and protests over changes in Thurgood Marshall College’s Dimensions of Culture curriculum.
Brainerd said the former speech-policy committee was given According to the current draft
of the new speech policy, the following zones would only permit electronically ampliﬁ  ed speech between certain times. Otherwise, electronic devices could be used in any area, as long as the the speaker is 150 feet from an occupied building. No on-campus expression would be permitted to exceed 90 decibels.

“It is possible that this has been 
around for a while and that we may 
see more cases just because we’re now looking for it, ” Fleming said. “That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s ‘spread-ing’ , but that we are just ‘seeing’ what’s already been there. ”
There have been five confirmed 
cases in the county. All reports have been mild in nature, and those infect-ed have made full recoveries. 
Three probable cases have also 
been reported. The most recent was a San Diego State University stu-dent, announced late Tuesday night. City officials are awaiting Centers for Disease Control test results to con-firmed the three cases as swine flu.
The previous Tuesday, a 10-year-
old boy was the first to be infected with the virus in San Diego County. Since then, laboratory testing through the CDC has confirmed cases of swine flu in a 54-year-old man and his 16-year-old daughter, a 7-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, and California became the first state to begin performing in-state laboratory testing instead of sending samples to the CDC labora-tory in Atlanta.
Meanwhile, the White House 
requested $1.5 billion from Congress to fight the outbreak by producing more antiviral drugs and working on a vaccine specific to swine flu. 
The virus has hit 11 states and 
eight countries. There are 14 con-firmed and 17 probable cases in California. The swine flu outbreak originat-
ed in Mexico, and the only fatal-ity from swine flu outside of Mexico — a 23-month-old Mexican toddler visiting Texas — was confirmed Wednesday morning.
At the UCSD Medical Center, 
staff members are taking extra pre-cautions to prevent the flu from spreading.
“We prepare all year round for 
these types of emergencies, ” UCSD Medical Center spokeswoman Jackie Carr said. “We drill to make sure we are ready in the event that something like this takes place. … We aren’t wearing masks at the moment, but we are making sure that everyone is washing their hands carefully, espe-cially every single time following a sneeze or cough, wiping down hospi-tal surfaces and screening all patients 
for signs of flu. ”
Infected patients have been treat-
ed with Tamiflu and Relenza, the only medications to which the virus is cur-rently responding.
“Stocks of Tamiflu and other med-
ications are available, and we do have access to the stock when the time is right, ” Carr said. “They will be dis-tributed strategically based on where and when cases evolve. ” 
San Diego County Health and 
Human Services Agency senior med-ical consultant Dr. Nick Yphantides said CDC released 25 percent of the storage units of antiviral medications with first priority to parts of the country where there have been con-firmed cases.

wished to hold the revote at last night’s meeting, others asserted that the council should wait until the board’s official statement on the issue before  voting once more on the legislation.
Others said the vote should be 
taken only after members of the public had been notified that the legislation was being reconsidered.
“How can we go ahead and talk 
on this when there’s no one else here to have this discussion with?” Vice President of Finance and Resources Naasir Lakhani said.
Similarly, Sixth College Senator 
John Cressey said the council should wait until the Grove’s student man-agers were present to vote on the legislation.
“Give them the dignity of seeing 
what happens, in person, to the place they spend all their time, ” Cressey said. 
Cressey, along with several other 
councilmembers, added that the legislation should be reopened for discussion, given the controversy surrounding the voting process. 
However, others on the coun-
cil — among them Associate Vice President of Student Advocacy Frank Carroll and AVP Academic Affairs Lana Blank — said the leg-islation should not be reopened for discussion since the Judicial Board’s decision only nullified the results of the vote, not the deliberation that preceded it.
“They didn’t throw out the dis-
cussion. … What they threw out was the vote, ” Carroll said.
Speaker Jordan Taylor added that 
the vote was not being reopened, but rather that an entirely new vote was coming before the council.
“This isn’t a reopening of the 
vote, ” Taylor said. “It’s as if we 
haven’t had a vote on this. ”

Most of the public input peri-
od at last night’s council meeting was dominated by 
members of Students for Justice in Palestine, who expressed concern that President Donna Bean  and President-
elect Utsav Gupta  were planning on 
attending an annual convention spon-sored by the American Israel Public Affair Committee. 
Several students asked Bean and 
Gupta not to attend, stating that they would be representing the student body and risked dividing the univer-sity community.
Both Gupta 
and Bean defend-ed their right to attend the confer-ence as individu-als who wanted to learn about the issues surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rather than as student representatives. 
“I’m going to educate myself on 
the issues, ” Bean said. “I hope there’s enough trust that I will not be brain-washed. ”
University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino addressed the concern the 
council expressed at its last meeting that University Centers and UCAB would replace the Grove Caffe with a corporate business. 
“We’re careful and concerned 
about the vibe of the Student Center, ” he said. 
Thurgood Marshall senior Kath 
Rogers gave a presentation encourag-
ing the council to pass a resolution that would call for the university to use only cage-free eggs. 
Koala  Editor-in-Chief Kris 
Gregorian  attended the meeting to 
defend his travel-funding request of $400 to attend the Second United Comedy Knowledge Organizational Field Forum (S.U.C.K.O.F.F.), a com-edy conference. In response to the council’s request last week that he provide additional documentation about the conference, he suggested that the council was being biased in its demands. 
“I gave you all the documentation 
there is, ” he said. ”If I give you any more, it’s gonna be made up. ” 
The council voted to allocate the 
funds. 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Frank Carroll  then made 
a special presentation to confront 
allegations made by Academic Integrity  Coordinator  Tricia Bertram-Gallant  that he 
had presented factual errors in a 
March 9 Guardian article. 
Carroll suggested that AIC has 
emboldened professors to pursue cases of academic misconduct that should not be pursued, said that the office failed at being transparent and pointed out that physics professor Michael Anderson  brought forth 82 
of the 466 allegations of student mis-conduct.
“There is something critically 
wrong with this office, ” he said. “It worries me, but it doesn’t worry the administration, which worries me. I’m a very worried person. ”
The Grove Caffe question was 
again tabled since some councilmem-bers believed that the public had not been adequately notified that they would be voting again after last week’s vote was nullified by the A.S. Judicial Board. 
Much new and unfinished busi-
ness was tabled until next week’s meeting so that councilmembers could attend the Death Cab for Cutie concert at RIMAC Arena. ;\]LMV\[+ZQ\QKQbM*MIV/]X\INWZ8TIV[

Friday, May 1
Doors 7:30pm Show 8pmLeethe job of changing the policy simply to update outdated references.
“There was no ulterior motive, ” 
Brainerd said. “It was just — work .”
A team of students including 
Balthaser and the two original under-graduate representatives on the com-mittee — who have since been replaced by A.S.-appointed James Baldwin and Erin Brodwin — composed their ideal policy, then got the thumbs up from the A.S. Council, GSA and the ACLU.
An extended and fiery pub-
lic-review period made it clear the “draconian” policy would have to be canned completely, and administrators put Brainerd at the helm of the new committee. Her team, which retained Associate Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff and UCSD Police Department Lt. Dave Rose from the original committee, planned to assess students’ suggestions and draw up a more popular policy.
Balthaser said arguments over lan-
guage in the student draft made for slow progress during the first year — until Ratcliff presented his own draft.
“I think what was stalling the com-
mittee for a long time is basically the administration didn’t want to flat-out reject the policy, but they didn’t want to endorse it either; so the committee basically just didn’t do anything for a long time, ” Balthaser said. “We actu-ally requested that they write their own draft, because they obviously weren’t responding to ours. So when Gary brought his draft, it was like — of course that’s what they wanted. ”
Committee member and Campus 
Counsel Dan Park said the biggest improvement in the new policy is its larger degree of student input.
“Basically, the current draft has 
been mostly written by the students on the committee, ” he said.
Balthaser, however, said the pre-
amble is almost all that remains of the student version.“[Our draft] got completely dis-
missed, ” he said. “There are some things that are still in it, but mostly just rhetoric. ”
Baldwin said Ratcliff and Park’s 
policy preferences best represent those of the administration.
Both, he explained, have consis-
tently expressed that “daily business of the university is paramount and needs to be maintained at all costs; that stability is more important than anything else. ”
Park said protecting university 
function is equally important to pro-tecting freedom of expression.
At a March meeting, Brodwin told 
the committee that she didn’t think students’ wishes were being considered as heavily as administrators’ .
Balthaser said the most recent delay 
is due to an emergency meeting set for next week which Rose called to discuss a line in the preamble that reads: “… Such restrictions shall be enacted in the least restrictive manner possible. ”
“His argument is that [“least restric-
tive”] is redundant ... He also doesn’t like it because it puts a very high standard on police behavior, ” Balthaser said. “ And I kind of like having a very high standard on police behavior. I think that’s very good. ”
Rose declined an interview.“I imagine several issues will be 
discussed [at the meeting], ” he said in an e-mail. 
Ratcliff said repeatedly that one key 
to ensuring that the policy is enforced consistently will be the line in the preamble specifying it be done in the “least restrictive manner possible. ”
The current draft, which Brainerd 
said is nearly finished, only allows UCSD affiliates to use electronic amplified sound without a reservation during time slots that vary depending on the area. The times were chosen by the administrators who oversee the campus’ various open spaces. 
“We have a very large campus and 
a lot of people have a lot of ownership over their spaces, ” Rue said.
Though the 1981 policy was more 
restrictive in that it included the use of nonelectronic devices in its defini-tion of amplified sound, each zone was assigned the generally lengthier and more uniform time slot of 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on week-ends for all unreserved demonstrations.
Ratcliff, who compiled the varying 
time slots, said that he encouraged administrators to adhere to a more unified schedule.
Valladolid said the new time slots 
would be “extremely difficult” to enforce.
“ All of us are concerned with the 
inconsistent time frame, ” he said.
However, several committee mem-
bers expressed satisfaction with the new 90-decibel limit for amplified sound — the point at which it can injur the human ear — as a concrete way to enforce productive expression. In order to enforce the policy in a consistent and unbiased manner, Valladolid said that police will always ask a demonstrator to consider not interfering with the aca-demic mission of the university before any additional action is taken.
Rue — who oversees the commit-
tee, along with Relyea — read a copy of the draft two weeks ago, and returned it to Brainerd with comments.
“That was to the committee, so 
that’s not public input, ” Rue said.
She added that it’s not the right 
time for her to be “pre-judging” the committee’s work.
Brainerd said she could not com-
ment on the vice chancellor’s input because she had not yet been able to decipher Rue’s handwriting.
“I’m sorry, I couldn’t read it!” she 
said. “I haven’t had the time to go through it with Gary and say, ‘Now, what is that word?’”

The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the opinions of the  UCSD Guardian, the University of California or Associated Students.As UCSD’s own speech-
policy-committee tortoise rounds the final corner in 
its two-year policy-revision quest, this board is left wondering: Just what is the moral of this story?   
The committee’s current draft — 
all but finalized and forwarded to the university powers that be, save for a final emergency meeting next week — largely protects students’ constitutional freedoms. 
But it’s muddied with arbitrary 
limitations and ingrained with inconsistencies that the committee should have been more proactive in overcoming. 
Although nowhere near as 
draconian as the controversial 2007-proposed policy, the current draft’s amplified sound zones rel-egate electrically amplified sound in many campus hubs, usually to a random two-hour window. The rea-soning behind these limits? 
It depends who you ask. 
According to committee members, the amplified-sound windows are an unsolvable mystery; because the areas are governed independently by their respective directors, those officials are allowed to determine the window. 
According to student represen-
tatives Erin Brodwin and James Baldwin, Associate Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff acted as a liaison to these various campus departments and led the commit-tee to believe that these times were etched in stone. 
But the directors — mainly 
college provosts and deans — are equally unsure of how their appar-ently arbitrary windows were cho-sen. Their reasons varied from accommodating campus lunchtime and not disrupting administra-tive meetings to following the way things have always been. 
Except that the recent draft’s 
amplified sound zones have nothing to do with how things have always been — each varies from the policy currently on the books. And that’s hardly the point anyway. 
The committee recognizes how 
random the windows are, and has gone so far as to include a recom-mendation for standardized times along with their policy draft. But their entire draft is a recommenda-tion, one that will be reviewed by campus higher-ups, then students, staff and faculty and revised again before it’s adopted. And the purpose of this committee was to propose a substantial policy revision. 
So why were committee mem-
bers so unwilling to override a handful of area directors? Or even speak with them to get to the bot-tom of these windows and lobby for the standardized time — or no limit at all — that they apparently support? 
It’s admittedly hard to get a hold 
of those people, but it’s also the larg-est unresolved element of a policy the committee’s been working on for two years. 
What’s more concerning is that 
the motivation for these amplified sound zones seems to be saving uni-versity administrators from disrup-tion. But Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s desire for a quiet meeting shouldn’t trump students’ freedom of speech in a neighboring public space. 
Rather than instinctively want-
ing to avoid noise, administrators should embrace campus protest and lively discussion  — listening to students is worth a brief meeting interruption. There’s such a meek campus history of people trying to use amplified sound, carving such dramatic regulations in stone is an overreaction.
Ultimately this is just one mis-
step in an overall less-restrictive policy. But if students can take any-thing from this lengthy tale, it’s that they should keep a watchful eye when this policy finally crosses the public-input finish line.

Since 1996, the Los Angeles Times
has sponsored an annual book festival where authors, publish-
ers and religious nuts hock their wares in endless rows of small, white tarp tents. While representatives from the L.A. Times usually spend the festival basking in Pulitzer-fueled accolades from their fans, this year’s staffers faced increasingly pointed questions about the future of their paper. 
“How long are you guys going to 
stay in business?” “Have you closed your Washington bureau?” “Can an online-only paper make enough money to stay afloat?” 
Smiling a little too widely, L.A. Times
luminaries such as columnist Steve Lopez and blogger Geoff Boucher spoke in reassuring, dulcet tones about online advertising revenue and the paper’s con-tinued commitment to the community. 
Regardless of the L.A. Times’ happy-
go-lucky posturing, newspapers like the L.A. Times and their ilk, sometimes 
referred to as “old media” because they began before the advent of the Internet, are being eclipsed by “new media” tools such as blogs, social networks and upstart news sites.
While no one is disputing the need 
for trained journalists, many would rather get their information about, say, rock climbing, from a rock-climbing blogger than a L.A. Times’  journal-
ist that has researched the topic for a month or so. While the rock climber may have poor grammar, misspellings or even a run-on sentence, their speci-fied knowledge will probably prove more helpful than an article in which the reporter interviewed the climber and then related it, however lyrically, second-hand in the morning’s paper.
While online news sites are often 
perceived as a democratization of infor-mation, one problem with Internet cov-erage is that bloggers almost always begin writing to promote their per-sonal biases. If you are so passion-ate about a particular topic, you are probably not planning on delivering neutral content. In rock climbing, this is fine. When covering politics, how-ever, this can encourage voters to seek out viewpoints similar to theirs instead of hearing the other side’s arguments, leading to an even more extreme par-tisan divide.
But, just because the Web spews 
a stream of constant misinformation, biased diatribes and personal rants, doesn’t mean that it can’t become a legitimate vehicle for timely informa-tion. While some more traditional sources may be, ahem, a little less “fair and balanced” than others, we gener-ally assume that we’re not being fed a pack of lies. Online news sites with no prior brand to build on face the chal-
lenge of trying to be taken as seriously 
as, say, the New York Times .
News sites that practice what has 
been termed “hyperlocal journalism, ” in that they focus exclusively on one geographic location, are gaining hold as a viable replacement model for the print papers that are in severe eco-nomic straits as they attempt to cover global news. But hyperlocal sites will EDITORIALS

Though you may have been wowed by the eucalyptus groves and weird art during 
your first starry-eyed trek across UCSD, dealing with a regular stu-dent’s routine has probably brought two things to your attention: 1) our parking sucks and 2) getting across campus on foot takes way too long — often resulting in tardiness and unattractive armpit stains.
So you’ve probably found ways 
to cope with transportation woes — whether that means catching the shuttle loop on your way to class, cramming into the Regents shuttle or playing car stalker in Gilman Parking Structure — and gotten over it. But after the Transportation Policy Committee met last week to brainstorm new funding solu-tions for campus transit services, our transportation lifelines are now on the chopping block. 
In a month, the committee will 
respond to student input by recom-mending either a $50 user fee, a campuswide $15 student transpor-tation fee or the reduction of cam-pus services. 
In making this decision we must 
resist our inner sloth and think about our priorities: sustainabil-ity, university access and afford-able options. We must safeguard the Arriba and Regents shuttles — lines that benefit commuter students by reducing eco-impact — and cut lux-uries like campus loop. 
Campus loop’s four shuttles cost 
$400,000 annually. Although that 
money might seem like chump 
change in comparison to Parking and Transportation Services’ annual $7 million expenses, it’s the prin-ciple of our transportation spending that’s important. While campus loop may be a convenient service, its limited route and meandering pace hardly offer a time-efficient or eco-friendly way to get around campus. 
Acquainting students with alter-
nate forms of transportation is the first step to weaning us from fossil fuels. That’s why P&TS should drop the gas-guzzling loop and introduce campus bike-rental services.
Transportation directors could 
base a campuswide program on already existing services — like the Why Not Here? Lounge’s bike lend-ing program in Revelle College — to speed up on-campus travel while staying true to its sustainable goals. Not only would vehicle maintenance be cheaper and our air cleaner, but the student body could burn off those Burger King visits with a little 
cardio, too. 
Students who are disabled or 
injured wouldn’t be left out either. Once they sign up for Americans 
with Disabilities Act transport ser-vices, they’re offered weekday van pickups and point-to-point campus cart transport. 
It’s true that while starting up 
a bike lender program might help change student viewpoints about transportation — encouraging stu-dents to bike to school altogether — it won’t fund the university’s grow-ing public transportation expenses. So if push comes to shove and we’re forced to choose between instituting 
a user-based or a campuswide fee, 
students should pick the latter.
By pitching in to ensure our pub-
lic transit accessible and affordable, we’ d be taking responsibility for our environmental impact and encour-aging students to continue com-muting. Keeping public transport fees low is also essential; if students aren’t riding the bus to spare the air, they’re most definitely doing it to save cash.
And who knows, with bikes and 
buses at their fingertips, maybe the auto-hermits will leave their cars at home and try to get their campus-wide fee’s worth.

be seen as just one of the many aspects of a whole new world of ways to read about events.
Proponents of specific business 
models — whether it be citizen jour-nalists, or nonprofits — must recog-nize printed newspapers will not be replaced by another, single model. We saw citizen journalism in play when a plane crash-landed in the Hudson River, which was first reported by a local man on Twitter. While this can’t be a replacement for traditional news-papers, it does provide useful supple-mentary, firsthand information.
An example of the nonprofit broad-
cast model succeeding in the news arena is Voiceofsandiego.org, a non-profit daily news site that began pub-lishing in 2005 with funding from com-munity members. Reporters at the site were recently awarded an important industry recognition award for top-notch investigative journalism, after uncovering widespread financial cor-ruption among two local redevelop-ment agencies. The reporters at this site adhere to a code of journalism that gives readers incentive to take their stories as a balanced view of any issue. Thankfully, the reporting they’ve done on the issues has led to the exposure of financial misdeeds occurring right under our noses.
Do you want someone to monitor 
your politicians? Or, would you rather do it yourself? In choosing a new busi-ness model, you should ask yourself why journalism exists in the first place. Even if you live in Washington D.C., your nine-to-five probably doesn’t come with days off to explore exactly what those guys in the White House are doing. Thanks to journalists, you don’t have to.
The problem with supporters of 
new media models  who say that estab-
lishm
ent papers must go is that with them goes the funding for news bureaus outside of New Y ork. The investigative reporting being done at daily sites like Voiceofsandiego.org is clearly superior, but they will never have an overseas reporter in Baghdad. New models will need to address this area once so capa-bly covered by large media organiza-tions. Newspapers are on their way out, b u t  w e  n e e d  t o  m a k e  s u r e  w e  d o n ’ t  discard journalism along with them.
Fortunately, as Marc Cooper, a pro-
fessor at the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication, remarked at the L.A. 
Times  event, technologies don’t simply 
disappear because people become inter-ested in other, newer inventions. As he aptly put it, fountain pens are no longer used for regular correspondence, but they’re certainly still easy to find. 
While I won’t be flipping through one 
newspaper over breakfast, I will receive news on a periodic basis throughout the day, whether it’s from a political site, blog or Twitter feed. This news is going to need to be reliable and timely.
This way, when a plane crash-lands 
in the Hudson, I won’t be spitting out my coffee in shock the next morning when I read the headline. I’ll know minutes after it occurs, and I’ll be able to add to the conversation if I’m in the area or have first-hand knowledge about the event through the comments section on my news site of choice.
As I listened to a panel discuss 
its innovative news projects from an entertainment Web site compet-ing with the Hollywood Reporter,  to the award-winning site in my college’s hometown, one thing became clear: No one has any idea what the next big model of information distribution is going to be. And these people are the head honchos of the media world. If they aren’t sure what’s next, then we have a long Internet highway ahead of us until we figure it out.?MJ.MML[I5QTM)PMILWV1V\MZVM\

Dear Editor,
UCSD’s e-mail to students sup-
porting Proposition 1A failed to mention that it’s a tax increase. In fact, the word “tax” doesn’t appear in the e-mail at all.
In reality, Proposition 1A is a $16 
billion tax hike that will increase income and sales taxes, nearly double the car tax and raise taxes for parents. Proposition 1A supporters know they can only win by waging a deceptive campaign that hides the fact that vot-ing yes on proposition 1A is voting in favor of $1,100 in additional taxes for the average family of four.
Students attend UCSD to gain an 
education that will lead to a career in the field of their choice. But recent tax increases have made California the nation’s highest-taxed state. A delegation from the state Assembly recently visited Reno, Nev., to learn why our jobs and productive citizens are leaving.
Proposition 1A takes us in the 
wrong direction. The higher taxes will cost us more jobs and further erode our tax base. If regular people have to tighten their belts when they face challenging times, politicians should too. It is time for the politi-cians to end the waste, fraud and abuse that have gone on too long.
Students also attend college to 
learn to think for themselves. Instead of sending an e-mail telling students what to think about Proposition 1A, perhaps it would have been more appropriate to send an e-mail with links to information from both sides so students could consider all points of view and then make up their own minds. The “no” campaign can be found at noproposition1a.com .

FOLLOWING DEATH CAB INTO THE DARK
QUARTET OF CUTIES DREAMS HARDER THAN THE SANDMAN ON NYQUIL
RIMAC is screaming. It’s 9:45 
p.m. and the lights just went black — thousands of students wait, as a blue light pulses, cam-
eras at the ready, eyes on the empty stage filling fast with clouds of purple smoke.
“Hey, what’s going on, ” Ben Gibbard 
says, leaping forward as Death Cab for Cutie slams into place and Nick Harmer pulls a pounding bass buzz into the ring. “405” soars over the freeway but expires at the crowd, shimmering like a heat wave and just as intangible. It’s so easy to start with a SoCal song — Gibbard hits the high notes with angelic clarity — but it’s harder to stop traffic. 
Organ-pounding drumbeats save 
them, bringing it back to the body on “Y our Heart Is An Empty Room. ” Every swooning fangirl knows it (and the guys all hum it under their breath), but the lingering lyric is “possibilities. ” Death Cab’s giving us too much to think about — a too-short guitar solo and Gibbard’s long, flappy locks distracting even as he channels Cobain.
So the mob murmurs. Cameras 
take a back seat as fans wait, nervously, for the moment worth their money and the long-ass ticket line. Then, Gibbard smiles. Like a nervous college kid playing his first gig (complete with the Obama guitar sticker), he starts to shake. Hands fly upward to clutch the mic for “The New Y ear, ” an unexpect-edly epic version that powers Chris Walla’s electric guitar to full-throttle rock. Gibbard’s a nervous bird, and he almost trips over his amp in excite-ment. He pumps the crowd, jump-ing forward and back, fingers a blur from shirt to mic to hair. It’s a move he’ll replicate for the heaviest songs; the heaviest of which (“We Laugh Indoors, ” “Crooked Teeth”) — com-plete with thundering drums and sky-opening riffs — stun many a fan into silence. Who knew Death Cab could rock so hard?
Compared to notoriously sleepy 
albums, it’s almost unbelievable how much energy reverberates on stage. Everywhere you look, Gibbard’s falling off an amp, Walla’s breaking into a solo and Jason McGerr — in show-stealing fashion — is whaling on the drums like they owe him money. The crisp catalog takes tracks from every album, mixing fan favorites (“Photobooth”) with clas-sic spotlights (“I Will Follow Y ou Into the Dark”). And on that last song, the crowd drowns Gibbard out — everyone knows every word, and the air vibrates with a singular crystallized emotion.
“I need you so much closer, ” 
Gibbard trembles on the last encore. It’s his love song to the concertgoers, and they respond, reaching out across the space that separates them from the gleaming, smoking stage.
Death Cab for Cutie
■ The Open Door EP
ATLANTIC
Let’s go back in time — way back, to 1998, when Lewinsky was humping Clinton, the economy was up and a couple kids were strumming chords at a little col-
lege called Western Washington University. Back then, Death Cab for Cutie hailed from rainy-day Bellingham and its first LP , Something About Airplanes , was still firmly rooted in the land 
of sedated indie sparkle-flies. Fast-forward 10 years to a platinum record, a major-label con-tract, multiple world tours — could anyone have guessed they’ d get so far? The quartet’s gone from comatose to powerhouse in a matter of albums; now, they’re headlining a U.S. tour with the scantily-clad EP The Open Door.
Guess all those love songs paid off. The five-
track list of earnest relationship fixer-uppers was cut straight out of the amped-up, atmosphere-swirled Narrow Stairs . And it’s pretty obvious 
why — they’re are all doped-up and giggly, too fun for the muscled-up gold LP . “Little Bribes” is a case in point: a twangy, folky jaunt that hails back to basics (Fleetwood Mac status) and pits Ben Gibbard’s tunes against his world-weary ways. “Y ou said that you were lonely/ And then you kissed like lonely people do” wades a bit too deep for a summer swim. Brownie points, then, to “ A Diamond and a Tether” — Chris Walla’s space-guitars actually fit the star-crossed mood. “I know that you can’t hold out forever, ” Gibbard admits (no doubt to at-home fiancée Zooey Deschanel), and just like that, captures the essence of long-distance love.
Death Cab for Cutie’s come a long way from 
Transatlanticism  (still a top-five indie fave), but 
it’s this effortless spirit that will carry the band 
through all the multiplatinum records to 
come. Even if money’s got them respon-
sibilities (mainly, babies), they’re still 
young — just over 30. And if Paul 
McCartney can… Baby, age ain’t 
nothin’ but a number.CONCERT REVIEW
"9 !,,)% #5%2$/ s ASSOCIATE HIATUS EDITOR
GUARDIAN: What has inspired you lately? What bands, books or artists? 
NICK HARMER: I just finished t his G
 uns N’ Roses biogra-
phy called “Watch Y ou Bleed” … Amazing! That band was 
crazy, and so off the rails! That was actually pretty inspiring to read about rock days of yore. 
G: Do you ever think Death Cab For Cutie would be that kind 
of ba nd 
? 
NH: No, we are definitely not anywhere near the trajectory 
of G u
ns N’ Roses. Not even close. It’s just so radically differ-
ent that I can’t even imagine how people make it through the world sometimes. Our songwriting — and life on the road — is far more, far more nerdy. I think probably the guys in Guns N’ Roses would shake their heads in shame. “I thought you guys were in a rock band, what’s going on?” And we like sitting online and blogging, running on the treadmill and actually, we don’t drink, so there you have it.  
G: You’ve been with DCFC for over a decade now. How have 
your  r
elationships with everyone changed? Or have they since 
the beginning? NH: Y eah, you know, in a lot of ways they haven’t changed at 
all. We ’
re still a group of guys from a small college town. We’re 
just trying to figure out how to make music and follow our dream together. I still see my friends, you know, like the day that we first met. There’s not a lot that has changed on some levels — and then, on other levels, everything has changed. We’re all adults now, some of us have families. It’s an interest-ing thing to grow older and into adulthood and also juggle that with being in a touring rock band. That’s provided its own set of really exciting adventures. 
G: What’s the hardest thing about it? 
NH: The travel. H o
 nestly, that’s the hardest thing about it 
because there are so many great things about being in a band. 
But when you’re away from home, sometimes — when you’re 200 days away from home in a year — that kind of travel schedule puts a real strain on a lot of relationships that are outside of this. Y ou need a real patient group of people waiting for you at home. That’s always the hard thing — you’re away for a lot of stuff. We’re getting better at [it]; we’re learning how to do it. 
G: You keep a blog called “Colony Collapse” in which you post 
amusing  pi
ctures, deep thoughts and guiding principles. What is 
a guiding principle or motto of your life, or of your art? NH: Actually, if there’s ever been a creative motto that I’ve 
ever subs cr
ibed to — like if I could get it tattooed on me or 
something like that, even though I’ d never do it — the motto comes honestly from the Muppets movie. It’s really had this resonance with me, a line in one of the songs right at the end of the movie when they’ve all finally come to Hollywood and they realize their dream and they’re making their movie and it all comes crashing down — because it’s just so big, and there’s just so much love and so much happiness that they can’t control all of it.  
“Life’s like a movie/ Write your own ending/ Keep believ-
ing/ And keep pretending. ” That little line in the song is exactly how I feel daily … And that’s kind of juvenile, I sup-pose, on some levels, but that’s really hard to do when you get older, and you have more responsibilities and a life to juggle. Real world expectations with the dreams you had when you were a little kid. 
G: What’s something that people wouldn’t usually know about 
DCFC?  NH:
 I think our albums are always kind of mellow, kind 
of q uiet, r
eal personal affairs. I think people are always 
surprised when they come see us live, when they see how 
exuberant and energetic we can all be when we’re playing. We enjoy rockin’ out, jumpin’ around and having a good time … It’s all about dancing and having a good time. Our show’s a celebration.INTERVIEW: DEATH CAB BASSIST NICK HARMER

In my junior (and most memorable) year 
of high school, I was lucky enough to find my name on a roster shoehorned with 
seniors who knew their fourth and final year had culminated in Mr. Ojeda’s “The Art of Film. ” Seeing as we spent half of nine months sitting slack-faced in the dark with our eyes pinned to the pull-down screen and the other half chatting about what we had absorbed the day before, the course was undoubtedly popular. Of course, I had been about as fortunate to land a spot in the class as my school had been to pay for it. So, because many students won’t ever get the chance to take a film class, the following is a brief guide to mysterious terms that any serious enthusiast should know:
Art house : Any film found “intriguing” by 
feminists, the petty bourgeoisie, Europeans or Democrats. See: “Last Tango in Paris”
Avant-garde: A French term to describe 
films that value artistic creativity over coherence, revenue, sobriety and the director’s original intent. See: “Treatise on Slime and Eternity. ”
Biopic : A documentary with fictional

MONOTONOUS PERFORMANCE ART SLIPS INTO SNOOZE MODE 
By Hannah Kang
Staff Writer
The play begins the moment you step into 
the theater. Several white-faced soldiers stand eerily still in various corners, hold-
ing props and staring at fixed points. A soldier in a clear glass box directs our attention to the mechanical actions of his daily life: He sorts his peas, he eats his peas, he salutes, he digs, he lifts weights. The black rubber glove attached to the box invites you to touch him, although he will ignore you. As you watch the actor go through the motions while gazing into the void of space in front of him, you can’t help but wonder — what does it all mean?  
Turns out, he doesn’t really know, either. The soldier in the box is Franz Woyzeck 
(Daniel Rubiano), the title character of a slate-gray dreamscape of drudgery. He is the army barber, a poor man whose life consists of cycli-cal toil so that he can earn his two cents for his growing family and beautiful wife Marie (Claire Kaplan). Woyzeck’s diet consists entirely of peas, so that he may earn a little extra money from a nameless mad-scientist-come-doctor (Josh Adams). 
Eventually, Woyzeck’s unbearable circum-
stance drives him to madness — madness that is even madder than all the mad people around him. Trouble is, the play stomps around too symbolically to tie itself down to a clear plot. It teeter-totters on the fine line between perfor-mance art and stony-driven theater. Marie and all the other unnamed actors receive a spotlight parody, complete with proto-gothic carnival music — a desperate, cheap-gag attempt to hold the audience’s attention.
Woyzeck and his compatriot Andres spend 
their idle time mock-marching and needlessly filling buckets of water. Such silent sidetracks only highlight the meaninglessness of their lives — and meaninglessness as central, exis-tential subject matter is just about as interesting as, well, peas. 
Despite these setbacks, “Woyzeck” lives 
and breathes absurdist despair that borders too closely on menial tasks, following the glass-chamber rotation of the young man star-ing out into the theater. The entire regiment of gray soldiers sprint toward the audience at the play’s beginning, only to be halted by something lingering beyond, amid the harsh light; something that makes them turn back to face the concrete walls in fear. Something then moves them (possibly the depressing chamber music recycled from “Danton’s Death” — come on, step up) to continue fleeing the stage and stumbling back, over and over and over. Only the fool, flapping about in his untied straight-jacket, remains oblivious to their attempt at aggression against the cage of routine.
The acting, of course, is remarkably fine 
— maybe even too fine. Rubiano’s beautifully naive portrayal of the pea-popping Woyzeck, in all absurd earnestness, attracts mockery from those who refuse to understand him. This Ewan McGregor impersonation takes on new life the further Woyzeck descends into insanity, until he deteriorates into a tattered shell of the simple, hardworking man he used to be. The cold authority of the doctor  com-
municates an educated, scientific objectivism, contorted with a strange and sensual perver-sion as cold and unfamiliar as your annual  
checkup. 
In another scene, the majority of the regi-
ment transforms into white-masked mario-nettes, and Marie and Woyzeck wander around the stage, enthralled by the dolls. Woyzeck imi-tates and prods one of the marionette soldiers, remarking to his wife, “Look at him go!” 
The two characters mouth the exact 
motions of the audience as we wander through the museum exhibit of soldiers: Y ou are Woyzeck,Woyzeck is you and this is as much our life as it is his.
Doesn’t life suck? 
Woyzeck

Lacuna Coil
■ Shallow Life
CENTURY  MEDIA
What do you do after guesting on a come-
back album with Megadeth, one of the big four of ’80s metal? If you’re Lacuna Coil’s 
Cristina Scabbia, you write an album like a shark — graceful yet predatory. 
Since 2003’s Comalies , the Italian band has 
been on the rise, blending Scabbia’s classical contralto with guitars on max distortion for a burst of melodic power metal (think Linkin Park meets Nightwish). Sneaking up the food chain, Shallow Life  packs six hammering, four-star 
tracks — then shoots blanks with six forget-tables.
Crank the guitars to 11, slice Scabbia’s sand-
paper harmony with baritone Andrea Ferro and the hunt is on. Like the distant smell of chum in the water, “Survive”’s guitars aren’t playing distinct riffs; they circle in the background, creating a wall of sound. The next three tracks slip into pulse-pounding sameness, a heartbeat inside your head. “I Like It” spins Scabbia’s jangling vocals like a harsher version of Pink’s “So What, ” muttering guitars chopping through tense verses while the chorus explodes, Scabbia soars, and Ferro follows in her wake.
But then the shark flounders. The radiant 
chorus of “Spellbound” unchains guitars for a stellar solo, but falls flat in Ferro’s sneering, I-think-this-is-American accent. Pretentiously deep lyrics and plodding piano melodies pollute the waters for an unclimatic, murky conclusion. Fortunately, a stable of radio-ready singles still give Shallow Life  plenty of power to chip your 
teeth on. For genre virgins looking for a first and metalheads who just can’t get into bullish growling, Lacuna Coil is more stealthy with just as much bite.

Asher Roth
■ Asleep in the Bread Aisle
SRC/U NIVERSAL  MOTOWN
Meet Asher Roth: that white kid who spent freshman year polishing off white Russians in his dorm and perfecting his 
rap-battle “skills” at frat parties. In his first major-label release, Asleep In the Bread Aisle , 
Eminem Jr. sets out to prove (again) that a cracker in the hood’s gotta have guts — even if that hood’s an ADT-rigged suburbia with a basketball hoop in every cul-de-sac and a Benz in every garage. Roth can still spit with the best of ’ em, but he’s easily overlooked with flimsier-than-thou material that’s — let’s face it — way less dramatic than a drive-by.
Aside from “I Love College” (unfortunate 
frat party go-to for the next five years) and “ As I Em” (Roth’s soundalike response to Eminem comparisons), Roth only raps about middle-class minutiae. “His Dream” examines his working-class father. “Bad Day” dwells on the time Roth forgot to bring his iPod on a flight from Atlanta to New Y ork. Seriously? 
On “Lion’s Roar, ” Roth switches from a 
fourth-note rhythm to an up-tempo, double-time track. Problemo uno: It features the king of double-time, Busta Rhymes — who rips through the second verse and blows Roth out of the water.
Not that we didn’t expect it. Roth’s steady 
flow and witty one-liners — artfully mixed into serious tracks (“Fallin’ , ” “His Dream”) and bizzaro romps (“Lark On My Go-Kart, ” “Blunt Cruisin’”) — get a gold star for effort. But even if we like Asher Roth (and kind of wish he was our roommate), the supersenior’s due for graduation. For now, take his words with that grain of salt on your tequila glass; after all, “Time isn’t wasted when you’re getting wasted. ”

Associate Hiatus Editor
The portrayal of director Noah Baumbach as an inse-
cure teen with a prick for a father was a strong selling 
point in “The Squid and the Whale. ” The marketers 
at Studio Media are crossing their creatively weary fingers you saw it — and presumably wouldn’t mind watching it again, thus taking a $10 chance on “Lymelife. ” But for your own sake, they also hope you won’t recall the much more honest directing, acting and story-line of “Whale. ” 
In Derick Martini’s underwhelming 
debut, the awkward growing pains of high school are molded, rather stiffly, into a square storyline. Growing up in the winter months of New Y ork suburbs during the late ’70s, Scott Bartlett (an inbred Rory Culkin striving for the shy candor of a soft-spoken, 15-year-old runt) hasn’t fully realized the reality of his working-class household: Dad’s having an affair with his secretary, and Mom’s coping with overprotection issues and a penchant for pot.
But after his brother (real-life big bro Kieran Culkin) 
returns from a sojourn overseas, he is apparently less reluctant to challenge their overbearing father (the paunchy Alec Baldwin), and emotional conflict bubbles over, despite the fact that the film, as a whole, remains numbingly dull. 
Mirroring Baumbach’s own experiences, “Lymelife” 
tells a melodramatic story about spending adolescence trapped in a divided home — only with fewer complex characters, the same worn subplots (think “ American Beauty”) and a tacked-on, sunny-eyed romance.
While Emma Roberts might not boast an impres-
sive resume, she’s more entertaining as Adrianna Bragg than Bartlett, who ends up wallowing in timidity for most of the film. Lively and brazen (and prac-tically transplanted from a Cameron Crowe film, sex appeal notwithstand-ing), she’s the only reason “Lymelife” barely pulls off the romp of a romantic comedy while palming the melodrama 
of a cathartic coming-of-age. 
If his actors had been more convincing, it would have 
been a good call on Martini’s part to rely so heavily on their feeble talent. But with Cynthia Nixon as the peren-nially plastic housewife (in shrill pitch) and Alec Baldwin the dour dad with a knack for delivering lines as mono-tone as Morse code, Martini’s crutch hurts his film more than it helps. Hard as Timothy Hutton tries in vain to redeem “Lymelife” of its weaknesses, the script and acting are too rehearsed to earn our favor.LIGHTWEIGHT ACTING COLLAPSES UNDER TIRED PLOT

FILM REVIEW: “ ANVIL! THE STORY OF ANVIL ”3.5 out of 4 STARS (Note to Webmaster: Movies are out of four stars, not five like music reviews.) 
By Michael Tang
Contributing Writer
Every 14-year-old who gets his 
idle hands on his father’s dust-col-
lecting guitar, couched in darkness of some suburban closet, dreams of becoming a rock star. And in the real-life saga of lead guitarist Steve “Lips” Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner — members of has-been Canadian heavy-metal band “ Anvil” — things aren’t any different, at least on the surface. As the fairytale goes, these two washed-up chefs might not merit more than a sneering glance, but inside, the ’80s punk spirit lives on.  
“I need to realize this while I can, ” 
roars Kudlow in tears as he confronts Reiner. With a receding, ashy hair-line and bags under his puppy eyes, Kudlow’s dreams seem comically unattainable. But it’s that underdog sentimentalism (and earnest indie docu-filming) that woos the hearts of any sympathetic audience. Who knows — it might just pull its self-titled band from the trenches of one-hit wonder obscurity. 
Led on a whirlwind comeback 
tour through Europe by eccentric and long-time fan Tiziani Arrigoni, Anvil faces a string of obstacles that might’ve made any other, less moti-vated, less “destined” band admit self-defeat. Count them off: disgrun-tled Eastern European bar owners, missed trains, strained friendships and burned bridges.
Nostalgic, handheld cinema-ver-
ite style camerawork is probably a direct tribute to 1984 cult mockumen-tary, “This Is Spinal Tap. ” It does the film justice, permitting audiences to explore the world of backstage con-frontations and dressing-room drama. 
It’s only when director Sacha 
Gervasi goes deeper — juxtaposing Kudlow and Reiner’s nine-to-five blue-collar environments with old concert footage and interviews with their respective families — that the impact blurs, with a biting sense of disappointment and frustration.
Ultimately, its Gervasi’s ability to 
excavate the honest, extensive and tumultuous relationship between Kudlow and Reiner that allows “ Anvil” to transcend Laguna Beach reality-show sentimentalism and tug our emotions. “I won’t let you jump off a cliff, I’ll stop you, ” says Reiner, after Kudlow goes on a divisive rant. Then his voice falters, the tears collect and Kudlow approachs with open arms.
It’s at moments like these that 
Gervasi’s  keen eye for heartfelt breakthrough lifts “ Anvil” from sim-ple revelation to solemn reflection — as the audience hangs at the edge of their seat, hoping for a big comeback.
“ Anvil” is by no means your typi-
cal VH1 recap. Instead, its unpre-tentious artistry pays tribute to the music industry’s life-or-death con-flicts — propelling the boys to the edge of stardom and tearing them down just as rapidly.*3(::0-0,+: ;/,<*:+.<(9+0(5 ;/<9:+(@(7903

UCSD held the Otter lineup at bay 
in the second game of the series, win-
ning 4-1. Gaito won her ninth game of the season, giving up only three hits while tossing a complete game.
The first run came during the sec-
ond inning on a RBI bunt single from sophomore catcher Nicole Monroe. Later in the inning, Lesovsky gave UCSD a 4-0 cushion with an RBI single. Lesovsky finished the regular season with 32 RBIs, tied with Habib for the team lead.
The Tritons will face Cal State 
Monterey Bay one more time dur-ing the CCAA Championship Tournament. The Tritons have over-powered Cal State Monterey Bay in  three out of five games this season.
“We are gearing up for this tourney 
and want to end our season with a win, ” Monroe said. “I know we can do it; the past two games we played against Monterey are proof that when we have our A game, we are unstoppable. ”
Readers can contact John Beck at 
jbeck@ucsd.edu.to do and we just managed to fin-ish strong, ” junior utility Stephanie Heinrich said.
On Saturday afternoon, the Tritons 
faced off against Cal State Monterey Bay, which also lost its first-round game. UCSD jumped to a quick lead over the Otters in the first quarter thanks to the strong play of freshman attacker Jessica Tran. Freshman two-meter Kirsten Bates and senior utility Bridgette Bugay also scored in the quarter, giving the Tritons a 4-0 lead. UCSD continued the offensive onslaught with Bates scoring a hat trick in the second quarter alone, while freshman utility Kelsey Schultz also scored, giving UCSD an 8-1 lead at halftime.
After watching her teammates 
stomp the Otters in the first three peri-ods, Gstettenbauer came in to score two goals of her own in the second half as the Tritons cruised to an easy 14-4 victory.
In the first game of the tournament, the Tritons faced the Seawolves, who they played previously this season, squeaking out a 7-6 win.
In the first quarter, Gstettenbauer 
and Heinrich scored one goal apiece, but were matched by Sonoma State to tie the score at two. Junior attack-er Audra Bloom scored first in the second period, but after that, the first half belonged to the Seawolves. Sonoma State scored four unan-swered goals to finish the quarter with a 6-3 halftime lead before the Tritons knew what hit them.
“Things just weren’t working for us 
this time, and they played really well, ” Quayne said.
The Seawolves continued their 
streak by scoring the first goal of the third before Tran answered back with a goal, making it 7-4.
Entering the fourth quarter down 
by three, the Tritons were staring down a big obstacle in their hopes of making it to the NCAA tourna-ment. Desperately needing to get their 
offense back on track and slow down Sonoma State’s tempo in the fourth quarter, the Tritons were unable to manage as the Seawolves scored the first two goals before Gstettenbauer could muster her second goal. At the end of regulation, UCSD found itself on the losing end of a 9-5 game against a team it had already beaten this sea-son.
The Tritons took fifth in the tour-
nament, finishing their season at 12-20. UCSD struggled with losing early on one of the team’s strongest offensive and defensive players in junior utility Stephanie Bocian; the team spent much of the season playing with a shuffled lineup.
“It was hard losing Stephanie to an 
injury during the season, ” Heinrich said. “She’s a good athlete and we struggled trying to find a replacement, but we worked through it. ”

more of a congratulatory event for a season well raced, and a no-pressure chance to slug it out with the big guns. ”
Hosted by the Sacramento State 
Aquatic Center, the Triton men begin at 7 a.m. at Rancho Cordova.
“We have spent all year training 
for this weekend, countless practices on and off the water all leading up to this race, ” senior co-captain Jon Lynch said. “Even with all of our recent success in the past few seasons, it has been 10 years since UCSD has won the varsity eight category at WIRA. We are not satisfied with get-ting second. Our goal is simple: win. We train too hard to go for anything less. ” 
UCSD’s toughest competitor will 
be Gonzaga University — the varsity eight squad’s only loss this year, com-ing by less than one second. 
“We are going to show up with 
the attitude that we are the fastest crew at the championship, with the idea that it is a mental advantage when others perceive us as such, ” Andre said. “I think we all know we have a good chance of winning the varsity category if we execute well despite the fact that we haven’t beaten Gonzaga in recent history. We lost to them in a tight race earlier this year, which we believe we can avenge, so I anticipate a dogfight all the way down the racecourse. We have a tough eight guys in the boat that I think will rise to such an occasion. ”
The women’s team is also looking 
to prove a point on race day. Last season, the varsity eight boat led the Grand Final pack up until the final five meters of the race, ultimately finishing second, just seven-tenths of a second behind winner Seattle Pacific University.
“Last year was quite a heartbreak-
er with SPU taking the lead in the last 10 strokes, ” senior co-captain Kelly 
Hansen said. “The nice thing about it is that we have three of the same girls that were in that boat last year and they are out for revenge. We are so driven to get out there and just attack the race. ”
The women will begin at 8 a.m. at 
Lake Natoma in Folsom. 
“WIRA is a very important 
competition for us, as it is one of the only chances for our team to prove that we are worthy of going to nationals, ” senior co-captian Alissa Kispersky said. “We will go into this race knowing that the boats we are up against are all vying for one spot at the nationals. Only the best will get there. We have an extremely strong eight this year, and I am proud to say that I have a lot of faith in these girls. If nothing else, we are going to bring our determination to this race. ”

WATER POLO — After three ardu-
ous days of play and several hours on the road, the women’s water polo team returned home empty-handed from the Western Water Polo Association championships, closing the door on a difficult season that saw one of its star players suffer a season-ending injury halfway through the year. The Tritons went into this past weekend seeded fourth in conference, but after a tough first-round loss to fifth-seeded Sonoma State University on Friday, UCSD immediately fell into the losers’ bracket and were held to finishing no higher than fifth place. The Tritons did sweep their final two opponents to seal the victory in the consolation champion-ship tournament, but the finish was bit-tersweet for UCSD, which had its hopes set on an NCAA tournament berth.
“It was disappointing, ” senior 
captain Sydney Gstettenbauer said. “We were definitely hoping to do better than we did. I mean, it wasn’t bad, but we would have liked to fin-ish higher. ”
In the consolation championship 
game, the Tritons were pitted against Colorado State University, a team they had beaten just three weeks before by one goal. The Tritons sought to com-pensate for their poor performance on the first day, and were looking to prove themselves capable of stronger oppo-sition. In her last game as a Triton, Gstettenbauer played with emotion and determination, dedicated to fin-ishing her UCSD career with pride. 
In the faceoff with Colorado State, 
Gstettenbauer piled on nine goals in the Tritons’ 14-9 drubbing, bringing her year total to 84 and tying a 1995 school record.
“It was great getting the record, ” 
Gstettenbauer said. “We did some real-ly good things [in the game]. ”
The Rams took a 3-2 lead in the 
first, but the Tritons, with plenty of experience playing from behind, out-scored the Rams 4-1 in the secondpe-riod to take the lead. Instead of letting up in the second half, the Tritons buck-led down and topped their second-quarter performance, outscoring the Rams 5-1 in the third.
“We just kind of came together 
for those last games, ” junior captain and goalkeeper Markayla Quayne said. “We were mad about losing early and we wanted to finish strong. ”
Gstettenbauer turned on the after-
burners in the quarter, scoring seven of her nine goals in the second half, almost willing UCSD to victory at the end of the game. With the score at 11-5 starting the third, victory was all but assured for the Tritons. Both teams exchanged a series of goals, but the six-goal deficit that the Rams had accumulated was too great of a barrier to overcome. The Tritons took their place in the conference championships confident about the finish.
“We were a little emotional in the 
beginning after losing so bad the first d a y ,  b u t  w e  k n e w  w h a t  w e  n e e d e d

CREW — The waters of Northern 
California are set to welcome a flurry of boat races this week-end. Competing in the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta on May 2 and 3, the UCSD men’s and women’s crew teams head out to the state’s capital with victories on their minds and the ambition to prove they belong at nationals. 
Off to an inspiring start, the UCSD 
men’s varsity eight has compiled a record-breaking season. At the San Diego Crew Classic, the team recap-tured the Cal Cup, earning a spot in next year’s Copley Cup. The varsity eight has also held a top-25 rank-ing from the U.S. Rowing Collegiate National Polls every week this sea-son and has a shot at making the Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championships, a feat accomplished by no California schools outside of perennial power-houses Cal and Stanford.
“ Although we’ve shown that we 
know how to win, the important race is this coming weekend, ” senior co-captain Ryan Andre said. “If we can win the varsity category at WIRA I think that would be proof of a really special boat.  To win the big regattas so consistently without a hiccup would be a rare achievement. If we do well at WIRA we can then look into the IRA regatta. Making an appearance there would be a first for UCSD rowing. In my eyes that is CREW HEADS

SOFTBALL —  The regular season 
may be over, but the Tritons know there are still important games left to play. After splitting a four-game series with Cal State Monterey Bay April 24 and 25, the Tritons clinched the No. 3 seed for the 2009 California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship Tournament. The Tritons (27-22,17-14 CCAA) will face No. 2 seed Cal State Monterey Bay (34-25-1, 20-12 CCAA) again tonight at Arnaiz Field in Stockton, Calif., at 7 p.m.
UCSD marched into Monterey Bay 
looking to secure a berth in the cham-pionship tournament, but failed to do so in the first game of the series, losing a tight game to the Otters 4-3.
The Tritons took an early 1-0 lead 
in the first inning of the opening game. Sophomore outfielder Kristyn Lesovsky led off the game with a dou-ble, scoring later in the inning on an error. The game was tied at one after three innings before UCSD regained its one-run lead in the fourth. Senior first baseman Jenni Habib smacked a double and came around to score, tak-ing advantage of another Otter error. Cal State Monterey Bay responded by scoring three runs in the third, putting the Tritons in a 4-2 hole.
UCSD grabbed one more run in the 
sixth when senior outfielder Allison May slapped a single and advanced to second base on a passed ball. May was finally driven home with an RBI dou-ble by sophomore infielder Jennifer DeFazio. That was the last run of the game, but the Tritons were unable to plate the tying run, falling behind Cal State Monterey Bay 4-3.
The Otters continued to outplay 
UCSD, taking the second game of the doubleheader 5-0. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth inning, when Cal State Monterey Bay scored three runs on three hits and one UCSD error. The Otters added two more runs in the bottom of the fifth, capping off the shutout. The Tritons, who tallied six hits in the contest, had opportunities to score but failed to capitalize with runners on base. UCSD loaded the bases in the fourth inning but failed to score any runs. Sophomore outfielder Katrin Gabriel and junior catcher Nicole Saari each had two hits in the loss while the Tritons stranded a total of 12 runners.
UCSD freshman pitcher Camile 
Gaito was tagged with her second loss of the season. Gaito pitched six innings, giving up eight hits and two walks.
After dropping two straight games, 
the Tritons fell from fourth place, heading into the last day of the regular season without a playoff spot. Needing to win its last two games to play in the postseason, UCSD responded to the pressure. Taking the final pair of contests against the Otters, the Tritons 
clinched the No. 3 seed in the CCAA 
Championship Tournament. UCSD dominated the first game 10-4 and took the second game 4-1.
The Triton lineup jumped on the 
Otter starting pitcher early, scoring five runs in the first two innings. Saari drove in Lesovsky with an RBI single to left field in the first to open up the scoring. UCSD continued adding to its lead in the second inning. Habib stroked a two-run double to right field, giving the Tritons a 5-0 advantage. Habib finished the game with three hits and five RBIs.
The Otters answered back in the 
fifth inning, scoring three runs to reduce the Triton lead to 5-3. UCSD went on to extend the lead in the sev-enth inning. May led off with a homer — her first of the season. The Tritons added four more runs in the final inning, giving them a commanding
