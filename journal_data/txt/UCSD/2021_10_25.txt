MEN’S SOCCER.........12VOLUME 55, ISSUE 5   MONDAY , OCTOBER 25, 2021  
On Oct. 13, representatives from UC-AFT, the union that represents contingent teaching 
faculty across the University of California, stood with signs and informational handouts 
to indicate their plans for a strike. UC-AFT has been bargaining since April 2019 with the 
UC Office of the President for more transparent labor relations and concrete contract agreements.
UC-AFT authorized their collective ability to strike at any given moment in June 2021  — 
passing with a 96 percent majority vote.  UC-AFT faculty lecturers are demanding more 
sustainable and equitable employment as job stability and salary continue to decrease each year. 
So far, UCOP and UC-AFT have failed to come to an agreement in their recent bargaining sessions. 
Dr. Megan Strom, an instructor for the Dimensions Of Culture Program and UC-AFT Unit 18 Collective Chair, told The UCSD Guardian that the University needs to find common ground with faculty. 
“If they don’t meet us in bargaining […] and we do not find that the University is meeting the needs that 
we have as lecturers, then we will be forced to strike, ” Strom said. “We don’t want to strike, but it’s up to them. ” DACA Faces Renewed 
Legal Challenges
Photo of the Geisel Protesters taken by Tanya Bharatula for The UCSD GuardianThe Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals policy was recently in the 
headlines due to various new legal 
challenges to strike the policy down. In response, President Joe Biden’s 
administration has announced plans 
to reinforce this policy.
DACA, which was first 
implemented in 2012 as an executive order, provides undocumented individuals with benefits such as 
valid U.S. work authorization, a valid 
Social Security number, the ability to travel within the U.S., and security 
against deportation.
To apply, the program requires 
applicants to have arrived in the United States under the age of 16, 
have resided continuously in the U.S. for five years before June 2012, have 
not been convicted of a felony, and 
have enrolled in or graduated from a high school/GED equivalent or have 
been honorably discharged member 
of the military.
The most recent legal challenge 
that DACA faced was in the July 2021 court case, The State of Texas v. The United States of America. 
Federal Judge Andrew Hanen of the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas blocked the policy, 
claiming it to be illegal, therefore 
preventing any new applicants while thousands in the U.S. still waited to 
apply.
In an interview with The UCSD 
Guardian, Daniel Alfaro, the program 
manager at Undocumented Student Services, said that DACA continues 
to be a contested issue because of 
its nature amid political divides regarding citizenship.
“It comes down to politics and, 
sadly, undocumented families have been a bargaining chip for many 
years, ” Alfaro said. “This is very 
unfortunate for undocumented students, including those with DACA, 
because they have an education 
and the potential to do so much for this country, but that is hampered 
without the option to have a pathway 
to citizenship. ”
In response, a new rule was 
announced by Biden on Sept. 27 that aims to protect DACA and reaffirm its commitment to protecting young 
undocumented individuals or 
“dreamers” from deportation. The rule works to fortify the deferred 
action for those who came to the U.S. 
as young children and to provide a much more detailed and in-depth 
description of DACA and its benefits.
The University of California has 
a history dealing with the legality of DACA. In a 2017 court case 
against the Department of Homeland Security, the UC Board of Regents 
sued the DHS for its decision to 
rescind DACA and how it would not just affect the students, but the 
community as a whole.
“The United States, and 
the University, have benefited enormously from the presence of the 
Dreamers, accomplished young men, and women who are our students, 
and colleagues, and neighbors, ” The 
UC Board of Regents said in their B y JOCEL YN BROSSIA    Associate News EDITORCAMPUS
UC-AFT Faculty Plan Strike Amidst 2.5-year Struggle in 
Demanding Sustainable Labor Contracts from UCOPLEGAL
B y Rodrigo Gutierrez
Contributing Writer
See LEGAL,  page 3 See CAMPUS,  page 3“Our working conditions are your learning conditions, ” UC-AFT faculty lecturers at UC San Diego said. 
“Their flexibility is our instability. ” 
Contract Negotiations
The weteachuc.org website outlines the faculty lecturer’s 
demands and provides a comprehensive timeline of their campaign. 
“Lecturers’ bargaining priorities include consistent review and rehiring processes 
to ensure that the UC retains its best instructors, enforceable workload standards that provide UC students with the best possible education, and fair compensation that reflects 
lecturers’ training, experience, and contributions to the UC, ” the UC-AFT website reads. 
University management has accepted a proposed 1-2-3 year contract agreement, which is similar 
to UC-AFT’s previous suggestions. The idea of this agreement is that a lecturer is granted a one-year contract followed by a performance review, which, if passable, would result then in a two-year 
contract; the performance review for the two-year contract could then garner the three-year contract. 
However, the agreement contains loopholes that the UC-AFT is fighting to change. 
Current exceptions placed forth by management include the proposed ability to set 
appointment lengths to less than the accepted two or three years, which could prevent their 
qualifications for performance reviews. As of now, UCSD lecturers who have yet to reach 
their sixth year of lecturing can only use student CAPE reviews as a metric for performance. 
The opinion-based reviews can be poor measurements of instructional ability because they are reportedly 
often over-saturated with bigoted, ad hominem opinions, according to Dr. Briana Iatarola, a lecturer from the Communications, Environmental Studies, and Warren College Writing Program Departments.
“I have to deal with all of the bloated critiques that come through that are sexist, racist, gendered, 
misogynistic, ” Iatarola said. “Tell me there’s not a better way to assess outcomes of your own lecturers. ”
Inequitable Salaries
At the informational rally on Oct. 13, the printed handouts highlighted how University lectur -
ers often qualify as low-income despite the recent tuition increase from the UC Board of Regents. 
“[University of California] Pres. [Michael] Drake raised your tuition promising to reduce class 
sizes and reinvest in faculty, ” the handout read. “But the lecturers who teach one-third of cred-
it courses at UC qualify as low income in six of nine counties where UC campuses are located. ”
Latarola has been teaching at UC San Diego since 2018. In her experience, she feels that her 
and her colleagues’ teaching abilities are treated as a transactional tool for economic growth. 
“The push for seeing universities as a site of extraction and economic growth — not intellectual develop-
ment, teaching, and learning — has brought forth this very crisis […], ” Iatarola said. “Y ou extract their la -
bor, you see how much you can get out of them, then you churn them, you push them aside, and you bring in the next robust, healthy round of Ph.D. graduates. […] Their job is seen as a supplement to some magi -
cal full-time gig they have outside of UCSD where this is supplemental income. ” UCnet stated in a release on Oct. 12 that the University highly values its lecturing faculty, which is reflected in their working conditions.
“This high regard is reflected in the fact that UC lecturers enjoy some of the best pay, ben-
efits and working conditions in the country, and a level of employment stability that only FALL FASHION

A.S. Council Brief: Student Accessibility , Vaccinations, and Textbook Access
Abb y Lee acl008@ucsd.eduWeek 3
At the A.S. Council’s Week 
3 meeting on Oct. 13, senators 
discussed accessibility to 
on-campus dining options, 
the Office of Students with 
Disabilities (OSD) input committee, and COVID-19. 
Senators also debated their Week 
4 meeting agenda, given that the scheduled special presentation 
on textbook affordability had 
been tabled. 
John Muir College Senator 
Serena Zheng updated everyone on her efforts to work with Housing Dining Hospitality to bring dining food trucks to Camp 
Snoopy, which is located behind 
the Gilman Parking Structure and next to Pepper Canyon Hall. 
She spoke about the necessity 
of such food trucks, citing the sizable student population and 
the lack of accessible on-campus 
dining options for Camp Snoopy residents.
“Camp Snoopy this year houses 
about 296 overflow students from each college […], ” she said .“ Students living there have to walk 
about 15 to 20 minutes to any of 
the dining halls on campus. And that includes Foodworx, which 
used to be close, but [because 
of nearby construction, students have to make a detour [to reach 
Foodworx]. ” 
However, after speaking 
to Ralph Dauphin, Assistant 
Director of Business 
Development Dining, Markets, 
and Culinary Services at HDH, Zheng warns that there may 
be challenges to implementing 
the food trucks immediately. Dauphin had explained that the 
idea was feasible, but HDH is 
currently 40 percent understaffed at the moment and would not be able to provide employees to 
manage the food trucks.  
Zheng explained that if the 
staffing situation is resolved, it 
would be highly likely for food 
trucks to be implemented at 
Camp Snoopy, especially since food trucks were stationed there previously. Currently, she plans to work with other A.S. members 
to resolve HDH’s staffing issues 
to facilitate the food truck implementation. 
Vice President of Campus 
Affairs Isaac Lara also provided updates on the Office of Health and Wellbeing’s collaborative 
efforts with OSD. The Office 
of Health and Wellbeing has connected with OSD Director 
Joanna Boval, and they are 
working to establish a standing committee or advisory board 
to the OSD. This would allow 
students to give input directly to the OSD, as well as allow for a more centralized disability 
advocacy on campus.
Later on in the A.S. meeting, 
Lara also detailed updates from the Student Health and Advisory 
(SHA) Board, where he was reassured by the updates they 
provided on UC San Diego’s high 
vaccination coverage.
“Our vaccination rates are 
doing quite great, ” Lara said.  
“We are at 93 percent complete 
vaccination of our campus population. ”
He explained that UCSD is 
not at a 100 percent vaccination rate due to several factors. First, 
some students are coming from 
areas where the vaccine is not offered and they are currently in 
the process of getting a complete 
vaccination. There are also approximately 600 religious or medical exemptions. He noted, 
however, that some exemptions 
are temporary due to recent infection. It is projected that 2000 
students are not in compliance 
with the mandate. 
Week 4
At the Week 4 meeting on Oct. 
20, the A.S. Council discussed 
a range of issues, including a 
special presentation by Auxiliary 
Services regarding textbook 
affordability.
The presentation was 
sponsored by A.S. President 
Manu Agni, and senators provided their feedback on the 
program. Senators also raised concerns about the feasibility of 
the program, given its early opt-
out deadline.
Thomas Bonetati, Director 
of Auxiliary Services, presented his department’s proposal to alleviate the financial burden 
that purchasing quarterly course 
materials places on students. Auxiliary Services encompass self-supporting services that 
offer non-instructional support 
to individual students, faculty and staff. His proposal, the 
Equitable Access Program, 
allows students to pay a fixed per unit fee and receive access to 
all the required course materials each quarter. 
“Essentially it’s the easy button 
for purchasing textbooks, ” Bonetati said. “ And we don’t 
expect it to be an answer for 
everyone, but we do think that it is for people that don’t have the resources or time to navigate the 
current environment of textbook 
buying. ”
Bonetati continued to explain 
how the program would mitigate the problems students face buying textbooks currently. 
These problems included the 
high cost of course materials, the difficulties students face in sourcing materials from multiple 
sellers, students’ confusion about 
the specific requirements of course materials and financial 
aid delay’s impact on students’ 
ability to purchase textbooks in time for classes. 
Bonetati said that the data that 
Auxiliary Services had gathered support his claims.
“For [the 2019 fall quarter], 
the average cost of materials for every class that had required materials, (was $120).…And 
now as we’re doing the analysis 
(for this fall), we [can probably bring the cost] down to $60 per 
class, ” Bonetati explained. “Our 
plan [eventually] is to have a 
set dollar per unit fee that gets 
paid to the bookstore, and if we charge in excess of that, we plan to sponsor [scholarships for 
students]. ” 
Bonetati brought up the 
example of UC Davis, which had 
implemented the same program 
in 2020 and was able to fund an 
endowment of $2 million. Excess money was able to be channeled 
back to students in the form of 
scholarships.
However, some senators were 
concerned about the relatively short opt-out deadline the program would provide. In the program, students must opt out 
by the second week of classes if 
they choose not to obtain their course materials from UCSD.
Bonetati insisted that this was 
the latest deadline they could negotiate with content providers, 
and that the opt-out deadline 
was already more generous than the one UC Davis offered. At 
UC Davis, students must opt 
out of the program three weeks before the start of classes. In addition, Bonetati explained that 
the UCSD Bookstore is generally 
flexible with opt out deadlines as well. 
“We kind of have this 
unadvertised grace period of the third week… [Extending 
the deadline any further] would 
make it really difficult for us to manage the pricing and the negotiation with publishers. That 
longer opt out date – I don’t 
think is an option. ”
In response, Lara gave feedback 
that the opt-out deadline for the Equitable Access Program could be well-advertised on TritonLink 
as well. Bonetati agreed it would 
help remind students to opt out promptly if they dropped a class. 
A.S. Council meetings take 
place at 6 p.m. every Wednesday and are open to students. Students can participate in these 
meetings by joining their Zoom 
link or tuning in on Facebook Live. N EWS  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDA Y , OCTOBER 25, 2021 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  3

No Clear Guidelines for Reappointment, Continuation of Employment
Strom is in her sixth year of instruction at UCSD. If a lecturer makes it to their sixth year 
of lecturing, then they are put up for an Excellence Review which can result in a three-year 
contract. According to Strom, only 10 percent of lecturers make it to their sixth year of 
instruction; the rest are denied reappointment.
While Strom is grateful to be one of the few who make it to their sixth year of lecturing, she 
wishes her colleagues were not subjected to this system.
“That’s not a place that makes me proud to work, you know, that I survived the gauntlet. We’ve 
lost tremendous talent from this University, ” Strom said. “I would love to be able to feel proud 
of this institution. Right now, I don’t, ” Strom continued. 
Dr. Michael Calderon-Zaks, who has been a lecturer with the Sociology Department since 
2018, has experienced the systemic extent of this university-wide issue: he initially began lecturing at UCSD as a supplementary position to his work at UCLA.  
“Even though I had stellar [evaluations] from the Spring 2020 Quarter [at UCLA], they didn’t 
bring me back, ” Calderon-Zaks said. “That’s just it — I had no right to appeal — there was no due process. […] That hurts students because if you get a professor you like, […] who you feel 
that your friends should experience or […] you want to take that professor for a different course, you should be able to do that. ”
The lack of ability to appeal may vary in its specific terms throughout the University and 
across departments, Calderon-Zaks said. 
“The bureaucratic structures may vary from one department to another, and they may — in 
the same department may even change […], but either way, we have no recourse to keep our jobs, appeal at all — even though we’ve already proven ourselves, ” Calderon-Zaks said.  
Iatarola expressed similar sentiments, saying that the lack of transparency in the current labor 
relations leaves both lecturers and students in the dark about the reappointment process.
“I talk to students, and they go, ‘Oh, [this instructor] did a phenomenal job, they’ll be here 
next year, ’ and I said, ‘ A phenomenal job does not equate to job security even when you’re a 
lecturer, ’” Iatarola said. “Some of the most phenomenal educators are dangerous because they 
use the classroom as a site for critical thinking and revolution […in] chang[ing] the educational structure here. ” 
Calderon-Zaks said that due to internal department issues, his appointment terms in 
anticipation of Winter Quarter 2020 were not fully settled. As a result, he ended up collecting unemployment during that academic term. 
“I thought my [Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act] COBRA benefits would 
kick in, but then because UC changed COBRA vendors in the middle of the pandemic, I ended up losing my health insurance momentarily, ” Calderon-Zaks said.
Options are limited for lecturers too, as tenure-track position openings are dwindling in 
the United States. Iatarola referenced the state of Georgia’s recent decision to weaken tenure protections in public universities as an example. 
“The reality is that, in higher ed. in general, tenure-track jobs are disappearing. [It is] the slow 
dismantling of the tenure system itself, ” Iatarola said. “On my end, I’m asking tenured faculty and tenure-track faculty to pay very close attention to the UC Board of Regent’s eventual moves to dismantle our own tenure system here. ” 
To Calderon-Zaks, the informational rally in front of Geisel Library provided an opportunity 
for students and instructors to exchange anecdotal stories of their plights with one another. He sees parallels between student and instructor struggles, especially as the housing crisis, HDH strikes, record-breaking admission/enrollment, raised tuition, campus expansion, and the 
campus’s Return to Learn compound to impact both parties.
“Basically, the return to campus has been one big mess, ” Calderon-Zaks said. “It’s been 
decided by non-educators at the top of the system who had wanted to raise tuition for some time […]. On top of that, they also added students, but no place to put them, no place to house 
them, or even a plan to feed them. […] They have to deal with UC’s incompetence and we have to deal with UC’s incompetence in similar kinds of ways, albeit different. ”
Strom, who wrote a 2015 dissertation on student-led social movements in Uruguay, has a few 
suggestions for concrete actions that students can take in order to increase collective awareness and support their faculty lecturers. 
Her suggestions for interested students include the following:
• Signing the pledge in favor of UC-AFT’s cause 
• Showing up to UC-AFT actions and demonstrations on campus
• Talking to instructors regarding the cause — lecturers, those on the tenure-track, and tenured professors alike 
• Spreading awareness
“We’re in a really encouraging place, but we’re not done yet, ” Strom said. “There has been 
some movement on the contract, but there are still quite a lot of loopholes that mean that the current system and the current status quo could still exist. ” 
“The power of student activism and student organizing is limitless, ” Strom said.
At this moment in time, whether or not UC-AFT-affiliated faculty will strike is dependent 
upon the outcomes of bargaining sessions with UCOP . The most recent bargaining session was 
held on Oct. 22 over Zoom; an agreement was not reached. 
This is a developing story; The UCSD Guardian will continue to report updates as more information 
becomes available.

lawsuit. “They are Americans, a fact that Defendants’ precipitous decision cannot change. ”
For undocumented students, DACA provides security through its protections and grants them 
the ability to study at institutions of high learning. DACA allows undocumented students to apply to the UC system which as of 2019 had approximately 4,000 enrolled.
In a statement released in 2016, the UC system reaffirmed its commitment to continue admitting 
students regardless of a series of factors such as race, religion, and immigration status.
“The University of California welcomes and supports students without regard to their 
immigration status” , the statement read. In other words, undocumented applicants with or without 
DACA status will be considered for admission on the same basis as any U.S. citizen or other 
applicants. ”
To support their admitted, undocumented students, the UC system offers a variety of different 
services such as immigration legal services, DACA renewals, and free legal assistance are available to both students and their families. 
Since 2013, the UC system has also issued various programs and initiatives targeted at supporting 
students of undocumented status. The Undocumented Student’s Initiative passed in 2013 is an example of steps taken to provide financial and student services that are geared towards the needs of undocumented students. In this case, the initiative provided the UC system with the necessary 
funding and services to support undocumented students in their respective situations.
For UC San Diego students, the campus provides its students with different programs and 
amenities to support the students during their time at the university. The Undocumented Students Services Center provides students with one-on-one consultations as well as immigration legal 
services to discuss questions regarding status.
“Our unit provides students an array of services, programs, and a physical space that supports 
their retention and success, ” Alfaro said. “We are committed to serving students through a holistic approach that encompasses personal guidance, immigration legal services, community building, partnerships, and referrals. Our programs and services are designed to help students overcome 
obstacles that arise from their immigration status and support them through personal and 
academic excellence. ”
Alfaro reaffirms, however, that the office on campus gives adequate attention to each individual 
student and their unique experience navigating the issues that arise.
“We are a small team and rely tremendously on 
our amazing interns to run our operations and 
provide individualized support, ” Alfaro said. “Our 
students do not have cookie-cutter issues and many see us for support with complex situations 
they are experiencing. Every year, every quarter 
I’m surprised by the things we see with our students but we never shy away from doing all we 
can to help our students be in a better place. ”
Students are encouraged to leave a comment 
here to voice their opinions on DACA, which 
is open until Nov. 29. Students can also find a summary of the Undocumented Student Services’ 
Office’s programs here, visit their official website 
here, or visit their office on the fifth floor of the Student Services Center in room 518.a select few universities in the nation offer their lecturers, ” the release said.
According to both Iatarola and Dr. Michael Calderón-Zaks, who has been a lecturer with the Sociol -
ogy Department since 2018, contingent faculty lecturers often take home an average of $20,000 per year. 
Iatarola’s annual pay/appointment cuts outweigh the set yearly 3 percent to 5 percent raises; she 
has been forced to triple her workload since 2018 in order to recoup that payment. The job instability 
also pushed her to accept a San Diego State University instructing position for this academic term.
“The University’s push for constant growth […] means that my class sizes from 2018–
2020 have nearly doubled while my pay has decreased by 17 percent every year, ” Iat -
arola said. “The longer a lecturer is here, technically, if they work with the same de -
partment, teach the same classes, the lower their annual take-home pay will be. ”   
When a lecturer reteaches a course, the University cuts the lecturer’s appointment time by 
17 percent due to the belief that teaching the same course requires less preparation. How-ever, Iatarola has had to remake entire course curriculums to keep her content relevant. “The last time I taught the two courses that I’m teaching right now, specifically New Me -
dia, Y outh, and Democracy [COMM 114D], I taught this course my first quarter as a lec -
turer in March of 2018, ” Iatarola said. “This predated the George Floyd murder, this predated 
Black Lives Matter, revolutionary protests across the globe, so if I were to recycle any material from 2018, I’ d miss an entire social movement […] That’s egregious to the student population. ”
Strom expressed her frustrations with the University’s fail -
ure to live up to their claims of stand-out employee conditions, as well.
“The more time that we have to spend […] working other jobs, worrying about 
whether or not we’re gonna have a job next year, whether or not we’re gonna have enough money to pay our rent — that takes away time that we could be spend -
ing on course development, that we could be spending on mentorship, ” Strom said.

PHOTO VIA REUTERSPHOTO VIA REUTERSThe Filibuster: Destroying American 
Democracy at the Seams
It’s a common legend that after 
the Constitutional Convention 
in the summer of 1787, crowds of people lined the streets celebrating the momentous 
step forward for the new nation 
with the drafting of a new Constitution for the United States. As Benjamin Franklin was walking out of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, an elderly woman asked him, “Tell me doctor, do we have a republic or a monarchy?” Franklin then 
humbly responded, “We have 
a republic as long as we can keep it. ” Fast forward to the present-day, where the Senate is wildly dysfunctional, unable to pass a simple infrastructure bill or raise the debt ceiling to prevent a fiscal disaster. The reason for this: the filibuster. In 
order to deliver on the demands 
and interests of Americans on Main Street, it is vital that the Senate recognizes the pitfalls of the filibuster and oversees its removal from practice.
The filibuster first came 
into existence in 1805 and was meant to serve as a way to end 
debate. For instance, the much 
smaller Senate would debate and once a simple majority — more than 50 percent —voted to end debate, the Senate would then proceed on holding a vote to pass the bill for the President’s approval. However, the Vice President Aaron Burr believed that the Senate should have as much debate as possible because of the significance of their responsibility. The original rule of the simple majority to 
end debate was replaced by 
unlimited debate where the Senate would debate until they couldn’t physically anymore and would hold a vote on the proposed bill; however, this rule existed until World War 1 where the United States was largely neutral and Congress was 
debating the constitutionality 
of giving then-President Woodrow Wilson war powers. Of course, because they debated for so long, Woodrow Wilson was mad and demanded that the Senate return to the old Senate rule: simple majority to hold a vote, simple majority 
to pass a bill. Ultimately, the 
Senate compromised with Wilson by initiating a new rule for the filibuster: two-thirds to agree to hold a vote, and a simple majority to pass. This compromise is the filibuster that strangles the Senate’s ability 
to deliver on the wishes of the 
American people.
With the Democratic Party 
controlling both the House and Senate, progressives have bold plans ranging from tuition-free public universities and colleges, Medicare-for-All, high taxation for high-income individuals, 
and a Green New Deal, all of 
which the American people support with well over a majority as the polls have indicated time and time again. 
With unprecedented income 
inequality since the Great Depression, rising costs of higher education, healthcare, and stagnant median wages, the middle-class and young professionals fresh out of college suffer the consequences from the havoc that the filibuster is 
reaping on the Senate’s ability 
to pass legislation to materially improve the lives of average Americans. President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus plan barely passed the Senate and only because Senate Democrats could use a rule called reconciliation where 
they can bypass the filibuster 
with only a simple majority of 51 votes. 
 If this wasn’t the case, the 
filibuster would have allowed Republicans to block stimulus 
checks and expanded paid leave 
during a global pandemic and economic stagnation as a result. 
In early August, the For The 
People Act was put to a vote in the Senate. The act would expand existing campaign finance laws to reduce the power of big corporate donors, 
expand voting access, ban 
partisan gerrymandering, and strengthen the integrity of our elections against foreign interference. Despite a majority of the Senate voting for the bill, it failed because Republicans voted unanimously against it and the bill didn;t reach the 60 
votes to bypass the filibuster. 
Especially after the 2020 election with the lie that the 
election was illegitimate, we are witnessing the disintegration of our democracy with Republican states passing bills restricting voter access and the endless 
flow of “dark money” into our 
federal elections. As of late, the filibuster has prevented any substantive action against these assaults on the stability of our “democratic” elections and has permitted our economy to exclusively work for the interests of the top 1 percent.
To effectively save democracy, 
young professionals, and the economic backbone of the country — middle-class people, Congress urgently needs to pass higher income taxes with new brackets on the top 1 percent, 
a public health insurance plan, 
expand voting access, protect the integrity of POC votes, and guarantee tuition-free public education for all, which the filibuster has always prevented -- effectively blocking all attempts to safeguard the heart of American democracy. 
Whether college students like 
it or not, our votes are beginning to matter less and less and we are entering a tremendously unequal economy with stagnant wages, extraordinarily high loans as the cost of college keeps increasing every year, and the daunting reality that carbon 
emissions will inflict irreversible 
damage to the climate — a future we will be forced to live in. All legislation that may reverse these trends is either being held up or has failed to pass only because the filibuster exists in the Senate. 
Abolishing the filibuster to 
allow the simple majority in the Senate to pass legislation is by no means a radical solution. In 1890, the House of Representatives got rid of the filibuster because they understood the fundamental flaw with it: if a political minority can block the agenda 
of the majority party that the 
majority of Americans elected into office, are we really a republic or a monarchy ruled by minority interests? By Nicholas Tappin

sexual abuse or exploitation 
from people in positions of  
power. 
An alarming amount of  
individuals have had an 
experience where they were not 
aware that they were a victim 
of  sexual violence until much 
after the occurrence. This is a result of  the blurred lines of  what constitutes sexual assault. 
No matter if  you’re in a pre-
existing relationship, initially gave consent but revoked it, or 
were unable to give consent in 
the first place, assault can still have taken place. 
A study done by the Society 
for the Psychology of  Women found that upwards of  88 
percent of  sexual assault 
incidents go unacknowledged by survivors. Another study 
found that 60 percent of  
female university students have experienced unacknowledged rape. The reason for this 
starking statistic is that many 
individuals do not label their 
sexual assault as so. Instead, 
they use words or phrases such as “miscommunication” or 
“hookup gone wrong.” 
It is essential to highlight that 
every experience with sexual violence and assault is unique 
and no one reacts to or copes with it the same. RAINN 
approximates that nearly 
70 percent of  rape or sexual assault victims experience 
moderate to severe distress, 
a larger percentage than any other violent crime.
While “trauma” and 
“sexual assault” have serious connotations and social 
influence, they can include 
behaviors that are often normalized in society . For 
example, some may say that Content Warning: This article 
talks about sexual assault and 
harassment which may be triggering to some audiences. Reader discretion is advised. 
Sexual assault isn’t something 
typically discussed on a daily basis. For some, it may be 
uncomfortable to bring up, 
and for others, it may feel as though the conversation is 
too sensitive. While this taboo 
subject definitely has delicate elements that need to be taken 
into account, it is important, 
especially as college students, to address the normalized culture, 
attitudes, and behaviors that allow someone to fall victim to 
sexual assault every 68 seconds. 
In other words, we need to start 
talking about it. 
Between rape culture, the 
existence of  prevailing social attitudes that normalize or trivialize sexual assault and 
abuse within society , and overall 
misinformation about sexual assault, the deep-rooted issues 
that make talking about sexual 
assault taboo can be hard to address, let alone start to 
remedy . In order to take the first 
step, rape culture within our society needs to be addressed 
and denormalized, and we need 
to acknowledge that sexual assault takes on many forms.
According to the Rape, Abuse 
& Incest National Network, the 
term “sexual violence” is an all-
encompassing, non-legal term 
that refers to crimes like sexual 
assault, rape, and sexual abuse. 
Sexual violence can take on many forms, anywhere from sexual harassment at work to grabbing someone’s butt is a harmless, common behavior 
and “nothing close to rape.”
A sense of  guilt, shame, and 
self-blame plague the victims. It 
is important to understand that, 
although it may be considered 
the most serious, rape is not the only type of  sexual assault. 
Instances of  rape culture have 
become too normalized in our 
day-to-day lives. From “boys will 
be boys” to straight-up victim-blaming, society has somehow 
enabled toxic and detrimental 
behaviors to prevail. Rape culture treats rape as a problem 
that potential rape victims 
need to fix on their end rather than eliminating the risks of  
potential rapists altogether. By 
excusing problematic behaviors, such as the normalized over-
sexualization of  women and 
telling them to dress a certain way , not only highlights the 
misogyny ingrained in society 
but also fails to address the root of  the issue.
Additionally , another aspect 
of  rape culture ignores the possibility that men can be 
victims of  sexual assault as well. 
From a young age, boys are exposed to toxic masculinity 
and learn that they’re supposed to be tough, strong, and sexually 
dominant. As a result, men 
often do not recognize when they’re been assaulted and 
do not express any emotions 
from sexually traumatizing experiences. 
About one in four men has 
experienced some kind of  sexual violence within their lifetime. 
Additionally , LGBTQ men are 
at greater risk than heterosexual men. More than 40 percent 
of  gay men and 47 percent of  bisexual men say they have been sexually victimized, compared to 21 percent of  straight men.
Rape culture also remains 
such a prevalent part of  Greek 
life, even at UC San Diego, 
which has had multiple cases of  sexual assault occur within 
its fraternities. In 2019, UCSD 
Sigma Chi was suspended as 
they were invested for multiple 
allegations of  sexual assault. 
More recently , the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta, also known 
as Fiji, has been called into 
question as a social media post was spread throughout the 
student body alleging a case of  
sexual misconduct within the fraternity . 
This is merely a fraction of  
the incidents at UCSD’s Greek life. Rape culture and toxic 
masculinity continue to be a 
plague and these allegations should not be taken lightly , 
especially when multiple alleged 
assaults continue to occur from fraternities on-campus. As 
college students, the first step in 
denormalizing such destructive 
behaviors is never to excuse them 
and hold these organizations and the individuals that belong to them to higher standards.  Especially as college students, 
we are constantly reminded of  sex everywhere we turn. 
From movies to social media, 
our perception of  what healthy sexual interactions look like is skewed. 
It seems as though we need 
a reminder of  what actual consent looks like. 
Someone unconscious 
cannot give consent. Someone intoxicated cannot give 
consent. Someone who is being 
pressured cannot give consent. Consent only comes through 
the enthusiastic confirmation of  
everything at all times. Consent is clear, coherent, willing, and 
ongoing. 
Although this discussion may 
seem uncomfortable to start, it is crucial to normalize the 
conversation and make sure the victims of  sexual assault are 
comfortable enough to get the 
appropriate physical, mental, and emotional help that they 
may need.
Sexual assault is one of  the 
worst traumas anyone could 
ever experience. Let’s work to make it so no one has to. Normalize the conversation on 
denormalizing sexual assault

On a chilly October morning of 2020, I found myself 
nose-deep into piles of vintage clothing at Kobey’s Swap 
Meet. Wandering around with my coffee in hand and 
a curious nature, I gravitated towards a vendor that 
displayed a vintage Britney Spears T-shirt. As I continued to look around, I found myself grabbing slip dresses, 
mini skirts, and a black sheer Halloween-esque dress 
—(that I still have yet to wear). As I grabbed a beautiful black mesh dress with red accents and floral detailing, I decided it was time to have a little self-control, so I  and 
headed towards the vendor to pay. Finishing up a small 
conversation with the seller, I took my items and said one last thank you. As I finally walked away, I realized I didn’t 
catch her shop name.; Tturning my head back I caught 
a glimpse of her shop name on a small poster board: Revival Era Vintage.
Little did I know that my shopping addiction would 
get the best of me and I would become a frequenter at Kobey’s Sswap Mmeet. Always finding myself at the Revival Era Vintage booth, I would strike up a 
conversation with the seller and ultimately became 
fascinated with her involvement with the world of vintage clothing, reselling, and the sustainable fashion 
community of the city.
With fashion at her fingertips, meet Heidi Cantrell, 
the creator of Revival Era and San Diego’s own vintage clothing reseller. Taking inspiration from old movies, 
TV shows, and eccentric musicians, Cantrell has been influenced by the style of the 20th century. 
“I’ d say my style comes from the 90s and 70s looks 
with some western flair, influenced by my home town. Combining eras is extra fun and creates such a unique look. Some of my style inspiration comes from my 
favorite 90s shows like Dawson’s Creek, Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer, 90210, That’s 70s Show, Charmed, and Dazed and Confused. One of my favorite artists that I believe has the best 70s and 90s looks is Mazzy Star. A lot of my other inspiration comes from other vintage sellers 
in San Diego who focus on different eras, like pieces from 
the ’40s and ’50s. ”
Coming from a small town in California, she didn’t 
start to explore her sense of style until starting college. Feeling lost in the world of academia (as does every college student), she decided to go with the path that felt true to herself.
“I was a full-time student working two restaurant jobs 
and switching my major every other semester. I was lost and unsatisfied with my direction in life. Shortly after, I quit my job and stumbled upon an estate sale by my 
house. I stopped trying so hard to find something to do 
with my life and just did what came naturally to me. ”
With her adventurous nature and desire to start 
investing time into the world of vintage clothing, she 
began to explore the world of reselling and what it had 
to offer to her.
“Shortly after I quit my day jobs I stumbled upon 
an estate sale by my house. I always felt relaxed when thrifting and found so much joy in curation. I spent all of my money on an old lady’s closet and dedicated a 
few months to listing on Depop to make rent and bills. 
After my Depop took off, I started expanding my style by modeling outfits for my shop. At the time, Y2k was just becoming a term within the vintage community 
and many people rejected that it should even be a thing. 
With consistency and drive, anyone can start their shop- quitting your day job also helps! The fast fashion industry 
pushes a style agenda onto the masses and I fell hard into 
their trap for years. They also use unethical practices for labor and cheap fabric made of chemicals- meant to 
break down quickly. Vintage clothing lasts forever, lets 
you choose your style, promotes sustainability and small businesses- what’s better than that?!”
Striving to grow her small business, Cantrell has 
started to expand her networking past small pop-up events, and into store clothing racks. By Priscilla Anne Puno, Lifestyle Co-EditorSwap Meet Royalty: A Look into San Diego’s own Vintage

Lifestyle WriterMy Favorite Fashion T rends This Fall
My favorite part of the fall season has always been 
boots. As someone whose spring and summer wear 
tends to be on the cuter side, fall boots are a welcoming 
transition to something a little bit tougher. And this year, 
nothing is as tough as these mid-calf Chelsea boots. The 
way the sleeve of the boot hugs the calf is reminiscent of a 
comic book superhero. Wearing these with darker, tighter 
silhouettes will give the impression you are ready to kick a-- anytime, anyplace. These platforms are especially nice 
if you want to lean into their intimidating nature. 
However, if you are looking for something a bit more 
low-key, these boots can still work for you! Getting ones 
with a little bit more room on the calf can make them look more like chunky rain boots, without the squeaky rubber. Paired with some looser, brighter-colored clothing, the Chelsea boots take on a new persona that lends itself 
more towards an oversized streetwear look. Additionally, 
you can buy these boots in white, resulting in a fresher, 
70s-inspired vintage look — think Go-Go boots. 
If you are looking for some new boots this season, these 
are the ones to buy! Not only are they cool now, but they 
also have a decent amount of staying power, making them less of a trend and more of a staple in the fashion world. Fall is here, and you know what that means … fall fashion! Now that the heat is —— 
hopefully— — disappearing, it’s time to bring out some warmer wear to match the autumn chill. 
To celebrate, here is a list of my top five favorite fall fashion trends of 2021!
Number Five: Leather Mid-Calf Chelsea 
BootsNumber F our: Straight Leg Utility Pants Number Three: Rugby Polos
Looking at another great piece from a similar aesthetic, 
utility pants are here now, and boy am I excited. If you’re 
like me and have worn the same medium wash Levis for 
the past five days, these are the pants for you. They are just 
simple enough to match with anything, but have enough 
personality for someone to stop you on the street and say, 
“Hey! Cute pants!”
The draw of these pants is in the name: utility. They 
make me feel like I am on my way to scale a building, learn how to metalwork, or smash a car with a sledgehammer, 
even if what I am really doing is sitting in the Geisel Library 
typing an essay on my laptop. They radiate power in such a 
way that I feel more confident when wearing them. 
I personally prefer these utility pants in black or tan. 
I find that these colors blend into my wardrobe the best, and are the easiest to match with pieces such as a vintage 
t-shirt. I also like matching them with simple tank tops 
or oversized long sleeves. However, for those of you who 
prefer something a little bit flashier, I recommend these 
pants in a bright red, perhaps with white stitching on the 
edges. Regardless of whichever color you choose, you better 
believe that you’ll look great. Out of everything on this list, the oversized rugby 
polo took the longest time for me to come around to. It sort of felt like both a retread of past trends and 
something silly that probably wouldn’t stay around for 
long. But after walking around campus for a bit and 
seeing them everywhere, I must admit I was wrong. 
I think the biggest reason I have come to admit 
that the rugby polo is a worthy piece of fashion is due to its stripes. After a spring and summer filled with 
florals, florals, and more florals, a more modest, classic 
stripe was well overdue. The rugby polo delivers, with 
its thick blocks running across the soft, light fabric. 
I have also come around to the whitecollar, which I 
contribute to the revival of Gossip Girl and its preppy costume design. 
A majority of the rugby polos I have seen were 
in navy blue, red, forest green, or white — or some 
combination of the four. These colors fit in extremely 
well with the fall color scheme, especially for those 
who, like me, have curated a wardrobe that essentially 
copies the style of Season 2 of “Stranger Things. ” This shirt makes me want to curl up in an armchair and sip 
hot cocoa as it rains outside. So even though it took me 
a while to understand you, rugby polo, I will admit you 
are a great part of  fall 2021 fashion. For rest of article, visit UCSDGuardian.org

Dark academia, here we come!
In all honesty, the dark academia aesthetic has never been for me. It has always been something that I enjoyed from afar, blazers and button-
downs staying on the Pinterest board instead of my closet. But believe me when I say that these shoes are probably the piece that I have been most excited to see become popular. 
Since loafers have been a part of fashion for decades and decades, I could never find them in a casual context because they were something 
my dad always wore to work, or my friends wore when they went to church. That is why it’s so interesting to see a modified version of this classic 
shoe everywhere. By adding a heel or platform and sometimes a fun adornment on the tongue, the loafer seems to be completely reinvented!
My personal favorite version of this shoe has to be the Doc Marten 1461 Platforms in smooth leather. They are durable and match everything 
I wear. Not to mention, Doc Martens are known to last forever. However, for someone who isn’t as into the tall platform, I also like the ones with a short loafer heel. They give off slightly dressier vibes, which is fun for those who like to dress a bit fancier. Both of these shoes pair well with 
the recent spring and summer trend of lettuce-edged socks: the pair of them really selling the 
academia vibe. Number T wo: Platform Loafers

NELSON  ESPINAL 
 
On October 13th and 14th, 
there was a small, buzzing circle of  
individuals with information pickets 
near Geisel Library . They were eager to talk and converse with each 
other or passersby , but all of  them 
were not students.
Rather, many of  the individuals 
wre non-Senate faculty , or lecturers. Though many students also came to show their support, the spotlight was 
on the lecturers that represented the 
University of  California.
On both days, there were also 
rallies around noon. A strange 
upheaval of  campus rhythm played 
out as one could see the lecturers — individuals who students trust 
and even happily flock to during 
office hours — call for their own needs: greater acknowledgement 
and payment for the work they’ve 
been employed to do. Ultimately , the lecturer churning process, knowledge of  a quarter of  lecturers 
not returning annually , and other 
information brought forth by CalMatters reports propelled this. 
Their purpose is different from 
tenured professors. Lecturers focus solely on instruction and 
mainly lower-division courses 
along with office hours; usually , they don’t teach solely large classes 
like permanent faculty in lower-
division do, but rather a mix of  larger and smaller classes. There are also more lecturers now than 
in previous years, something that 
might make sense when considering the increasing influx of  students and 
rising tuition costs. After all, UC 
President Michael Drake is in favor of  enrolling 20,000 more students in 
the university systemwide by 2030. 
This coincides with the increasing number of  lecturers being hired — individuals who are not on a tenure 
track that guarantees job security .
Lecturers’ goal of  receiving more 
acknowledgement is a simplification of  what is beneath the surface. 
They are fighting for fair workload standards, fair compensation, and 
a transparent, consistent rehiring 
process. 
The lecturers believe they are not 
receiving that job stability in return 
for their time. Instead, they seem to 
be positioned on a flimsy tightrope that never lets them know if  they’re 
wearing a safety harness until they 
fall from it.
This is because lecturers do not 
receive the stability that tenured professors get; they can be cut or “churned out” in various times of  
their employment like the first few 
years, a process that leaves them scrambling to reapply for their job every year or quarter or simply 
seeking employment elsewhere. 
Professor Michael Calderón-Zaks 
comes to the UC San Diego campus 
from Los Angeles and he compares 
himself  to the utility player in 
baseball who plays several different positions just to stay in the lineup. 
He has taught at UCSD since 
January 2018 and, amidst some scheduling conflicts for a couple of  
quarters, he’s approaching three 
years of  his service time as a lecturer. 
This quarter, he is teaching a class 
on immigration, race and ethnicity , and one on social movement and social protests, but he’s also taught classes on methods, theory , and 
more.Lecturers Aren’t Lecturing When They Say 
Their Win is Everyone’s Win 
“Why hire a tenure-track-
professor when you can get two or three lecturers who you don’t 
even have to keep?”’ Calderón-Zaks told The UCSD Guardian. 
“It’s more than just the cost-
cutting. It’s a big part of  it. But it’s also flexibility . Their flexibility is our instability .”
For lecturers, specifically , 
Calderón-Zaks said that there are no housing benefits like the 
home-buying programs tenured 
professors can receive. The loopholes of  some seemingly 
attractive contracts take him out 
of  the picture because he works on a quarterly contract and some only apply to those working yearly 
or multiyear ones. 
UCSD is located in the 
affluent suburb of  La Jolla. This summer was notable for 
the impacted housing crisis in San Diego, which affected many 
students’ living situations. The 
increasing enrollment of  students has affected their spaces and 
the in-person modality that is 
slowly becoming more and more present is only making this situation more visible.La Jolla’s 
cost of  living is also higher than 
other cities; according to move.org, the monthly cost of  living 
is $2,390, which ranks seventh out of  seventy four of  the most 
populous cities. 
Calderón-Zak said that public 
education and other services 
have increasingly been more 
corporate, with non-educators 
behind the scenes. Many who got 
jaded with this job
 insecurity or housing issues, 
eventually walked off  the job or quit en masse. Calderón-Zak asserted that people are not going to accept wages that continuously 
put them in poverty . 
The lecturers’ lack of  stability 
affects students’ instruction as well. The UC system depends 
on thousands of  lecturers to provide education to one-third of  the instruction undergraduate 
students receive. A strike 
occurring would also affect students’ instruction. 
Even seemingly small things By Eunice Kim
Staff Writerlike being able to write letters of  recommendation are curbed by the 
lecturers’ potential of  being cut. 
This points, too, to a deeper issue. Students’ chances to better acquaint 
themselves with their professors are 
potentially minimized along with 
professors worrying over applying or reapplying or earning wages. 
Interestingly enough, UC stated 
in a June proposal that at the start of  the Summer 2022, there would be a transition from a salary scale to 
a salary range, which means salary 
increases for those bargaining. Further, UC pledged that as one of  
two universities in this nation they 
will offer continuing appointments after six years as well as enhanced 
paid medical leave and more. For 
COVID-19, UC gave a contract provision that notified lecturers of  their rights and responsibilities 
should an emergency be declared; 
further, they expressed that amidst Fall 2020 pandemic issues, they 
did provide university paid medical 
leave and childcare needs. 
In response to them “turning 
over” lecturers, UC didn’t outright reject the claim, but they presented other reasons as to why lecturers would leave the university . Thus, if  
lecturers work six years in the same department, there is more stability 
and priority , though this does not 
count summer sessions unless there are certain circumstances.
The University Council-
American Federation of  Teachers (UC-AFT) that represents these 
lecturers responded by saying these 
amends aren’t enough to close the gap due to increasing living costs 
in California. The terminology is 
also tricky: less than ten percent of  lecturers get here. There is the potential of  being cut or changing 
to another department and not 
having that count towards the six years.
Dr. Megan Strom, another 
lecturer at UCSD, teaches two lectures within Dimensions of  Culture 1 about diversity this 
quarter. She has taught since 
Fall 2015 and is currently going through her excellence review. 
Strom is also the chapter chair for 
UC-AFT .Strom calls herself  a “unicorn” 
in this matter as she approaches her sixth  year at UCSD next quarter. After all, she recognizes that the churning process is a lived reality .
There is no review process 
for lecturers. And without that evaluation process, lecturers don’t 
get to know why they’re booted. 
There doesn’t need to be an explanation even if  evaluations are 
incredible. 
“ As long as there’s no evaluation 
process, they’ll just churn us out 
— which is what they’ve been 
doing,” Calderón-Zaks said.“What 
we want is to put an end to that practice so that we can focus on 
teaching. Sometimes I apply to 
other jobs because what if  they decide to change their mind about 
me?” 
Strom and others have proposed 
that there should be a one-year appointment of  lecturer status, 
then a standardized review. If  all is well, then the lecturer should be given the chance to be rehired 
for two years with another review 
and so forth. The third year would allow one to be up for an excellence 
review. 
This allows opportunity for 
growth and revision of  class 
materials, but it also offers lecturers some ease of  mind. 
Currently , at the halfway point 
of  the six years, the lecturers just attend a meeting to get feedback. 
What the lecturers seek is 
anything but feeling like their position working for UC is a side gig. They have credentials similar 
to tenured professors — many of  
them even have PhDs.
“We just want our work and 
our labor to be valued,” Strom 
said. “If  the University cares 
about education as they claim to, then they should care about 
the working conditions of  the 
people teaching the classes and the experience of  students in 
those classes.”
Perhaps the sense of  stability 
would also give lecturers a sense of  understanding how to instruct 
as best they can. 
“When they hire us, they don’t 
put us through orientation at all,” Calderon-Zaks said. “That would 
make the experience better for 
both us and students. They just hire us and put us through work.”
Both Calderon-Zaks and Strom 
acknowledged that their respective departments were kind and guiding. They said that others don’t 
get so lucky . Some leave, jaded and 
unwilling to have to fight for their job. Some end up finding better 
jobs at other universities.A strike 
may or may not take place in late 
May 2022. Calderón-Zaks, along 
with others, made up 96 percent 
of  those who voted in a strike authorization vote for late May . 
“That means our negotiators 
can call a strike whenever they want,” Calderon-Zaks said. “We still have to go through a legal 
process [too] in order to be able to 
do it. That includes mediation. For the most part, UCOP is dragging 
its feet. There’s been movement 
simply because there’s been pressure on them coming from us, 
coming from students, coming from 
tenured track faculty allies, coming from community members. They do not want to give us job security . 
They really don’t want to give us 
multiyear contracts.”
Rallying may get the ball rolling 
and the in-person quality may attract more individuals to attend, but if  the strike of  2003 was able 
to bring benefits like the six-year-
continuation for professors, perhaps it’s the next ideal approach.
For now, if  a student wishes to 
stand with UC teaching faculty , they may do so by signing a pledge on the weteachuc.org site, 
which has received almost 2,000 
signatures as of  now. Tweeting at President Drake or just talking to 
others can also help. 
Strom expressed how liberating 
it was to talk about the issue.
“I love teaching at the college. 
But I’m not willing to sacrifice 
my well-being to do this job. And 
we shouldn’t have to make that 
decision,” Strom added. “We have been told and taught that our 
position is shameful.  Part of  that 
is wrapped up in the way [the UC institution] treats us. I know my 
training. I know that I’m qualified 
to be in this position.”
Last year, all the organizing and 
rallying was held on Zoom. The 
platform’s ability to bring more 
individuals in a convenient, rapid manner together was beneficial, 
but reaching students in-person 
feels different and irreplaceable. 
COVID-19 launched financial 
losses for both the university and lecturers, but there is an invigoration among individuals on 
campus. There might be plans for 
a teach-in and discussions about how lecturers’ situations overlap with students.
 Because these events will 
increasingly be in person, it might be easier to connect others to the 
cause and bring other issues to the 
table, like the current housing crisis. 
It was how many students heard 
about the issue and perhaps, that connection will always be linked. Students need lecturers, and lecturers need students. But the 
university needs both groups as 
well to stay afloat. 
“Our struggles are linked. 
Our working conditions are your learning conditions,” Calderón-Zaks said.

In their first meeting with the 
UC Irvine Anteaters since 1995, 
UC San Diego men’s soccer team conceded 2 first-half goals to the Anteaters and couldn’t answer with one of their own, losing at Irvine 2–0 on Oct. 20. The loss is the UCSD Tritons’ fifth in a row, dropping them to 4–10 overall and 1–6 in their conference, as they continue to struggle in their first season in the Big West.
The UCSD squad came to 
Irvine looking to post their first-ever away victory in the Big West, with their sole conference victory this season coming at home, 3–1, against California State University, Fullerton, on Oct. 2. In the match against Irvine, they started off on the wrong foot as the Anteaters employed a high press to keep the ball in the Tritons’ half, placing enough pressure on the UCSD defenders to keep attacks from opening up in the first few minutes of action. But as the first half developed, the Tritons were able to get downfield more regularly.
UCSD’s first real chance came 
in the 9th minute, as a throw-in developed into a fastbreak for the Tritons. Junior midfielder Alessandro Allen crossed the ball into the box and found the chest of senior forward Nick Cirrito, who redirected it to freshman forward Max Carvalho near the goal line. But Carvalho didn’t have much space to operate in, and he pulled his left-footed shot across the face of goal and out the back for a goal kick. It was the same story in the 20th minute, as senior midfielder Mason Haubrich whipped an excellent cross to Allen at the left post; Allen got a foot on it but couldn’t put enough power into the first touch, as the ball bounced to the Irvine goalkeeper, Gordon Botterill, although Cirrito lurked dangerously nearby.
Allen was once again involved 
with the Tritons’ best chance yet of the night in the 23rd minute, as he took a through ball from Carvalho to the left corner, cut inwards, and uncorked a right-footed ground shot that forced a great one-armed save from Botterill.
But just as it seemed like 
momentum was swinging towards UCSD, the Anteaters got on the board first in the 25th minute. An incisive through ball from Irvine’s Beto Alvarenga cut through the box, past players from both teams, to the feet of midfielder Ashish Chattha, who fired the ball into the bottom left corner past a diving effort from UCSD’s junior goalkeeper Nick Shor to put the Anteaters ahead.
The margin got worse for the 
Tritons in the 41st minute, as Chattha got the ball inside to a well-positioned Ryan Khedoo, whose shot forced an excellent kick save from Shor. But the rebound from Shor’s save was directed back in front of goal by Irvine, and Anteater forward Kelvin Neumetzler was right in position to tap the ball into the open net, making it 2–0 in favor of UC Irvine.
This was the first time the 
Tritons had trailed by multiple goals this season, in addition to the first time they had given up multiple first-half goals. UCSD went into the half having been outshot 9–3 in the period and struggling to find consistent answers to the Anteaters’ aggressive defensive play.
UC Irvine almost made it 3 
goals in the 48th minute, as poor placement and failed clearance from the Triton defense allowed a cross into good position in the box, but senior Triton defender Noah Sonenstein made a key block on the first shot attempt, and nothing came of the chance.
In the 57th minute, Haubrich 
made a nice play by himself, dispossessing the Anteaters at the halfline after a lazy pass and breaking downfield; Haubrich took a powerful strike with his right foot, but it knuckled towards the Irvine keeper, who fell on the ball. Less than a minute later, Cerrito made a similar play at the left side of the box, as he made a big steal and got the ball inside to a streaking Allen. But Allen’s shot just sailed over the crossbar, and the Tritons remained scoreless.
Another great chance for UCSD came in the 66th minute, when Carvalho made a cross from the right side of the box to wide-open senior defender Jonah Bryan. Bryan perfectly executed his header towards goal, where Botterill made a great right-handed save to once again deny the Tritons.
UCSD’s night got even worse 
in the 81st minute, as Sonenstein drew a yellow card for a hard forearm shove on an attacking UC Irvine player; Sonenstein was visibly incensed with the call and let the official know how he felt — apparently in no uncertain terms, as the referee responded with a red card and an ejection. Down 1 man and 2 goals, the Tritons didn’t pose much of a threat for the remaining ten minutes, and a clutch last-second tackle from Bryan in the UCSD penalty box was required to possibly keep the deficit from rising to 3.
The 2–0 loss was the first defeat 
of the season for UCSD by a multiple-goal margin, and the 8th time the Tritons have been kept scoreless. That wasn’t for lack of trying, as UCSD equaled Irvine with 6 shots on goal each, but the Anteaters’ attempts found the back of the net where the Tritons’ didn’t.
“We put forth a valiant effort 
tonight, and the score didn’t reflect the way the game went,” said 13-year UCSD head coach Jon Pascale. Pascale hasn’t had a losing season since 2009, but such are the downsides of a move to Division I.
UCSD will finish out their first 
Division I and Big West season on Saturday, Oct. 30, as they travel to UC Riverside looking to end their year on a high note.
UCSD Men’s Soccer Falls 2–0 to Anteaters

UC San Diego’s women’s 
volleyball team (7–13, 4–5 Big 
West) came into its road match 
against California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo 
expecting a competitive battle, 
and they certainly were up to the challenge. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo(9–11, 7–2) took the 
match in five sets, with each team 
seeming to settle in more and more throughout the match. In a 
match characterized by big runs, 
UCSD came up one short and lost the match three sets to two. 
In a slow set one, UCSD 
had a tough time with the fundamentals that have helped them stay competitive throughout 
their inaugural season of Big 
West competition. UCSD was down 13–21 before a set from 
senior setter Isabela Dobra gave 
sophomore opposite Grace 
Cannon her third kill of the night. 
The first set was mostly quiet with 
UCSD having a hard time getting 
in their system off of Cal Poly attacks. The first set ended in Cal 
Poly’s favor by a tally of 25–15. 
However, UCSD came out 
with more fire to start the second set. Freshman outside hitter 
Zaria Henderson nailed a sweet cross kill to put the Tritons up 
8–3. The Tritons looked like a 
completely different squad to start, in sync and formidable up front. Highlighted by impressive 
digs from senior libero Susanna 
Limb, UCSD climbed to a 13–5 lead. Before UCSD could get 
comfortable, though, Cal Poly had 
a run of their own, but UCSD held strong with a strong block to put 
the Tritons back up 15–10. Steady 
play allowed Henderson to get a great kill to go up 23–16, and a kill from freshman middle blocker 
Juliette Bokor ended the set 25–18. 
UCSD took the momentum after a lackluster first set, but Cal Poly 
would not go down so easily.
In a crucial set three, the teams 
both looked more at ease. UCSD 
took the advantage with a great 
set from Dobra to put the Tritons 
up 5–3. Cal Poly would then break off a huge run to force a UCSD 
timeout, with the Tritons now 
facing an 11–7 deficit. Sophomore outside hitter Ava McInnes, 
heating up at the beginning of 
a great all-around performance (19 kills, 12 digs, 4 blocks), was huge for UCSD in the comeback attempt, and her block would cut the lead down to two as the set 
neared its end with UCSD down 
22–20. Despite strong efforts, UCSD lost the set to a prepared Cal Poly, 25–21.
The first rally in set four fell 
for UCSD, and the Tritons would start out strong again. A block 
from Bokor put the advantage for 
the Tritons at 8–4. UCSD was dominant to start this set, and the 
momentum obviously shifted with 
one of sophomore libero Natalie Repetti’s three aces in the match that put the Tritons up 17–8. 
But Cal Poly came roaring back 
with a 7-point run, and UCSD needed a spark to survive the rally. 
Henderson again came through and stymied the Mustangs to put the lead at 19–16. Another 
impressive Bokor block put UCSD in the driver’s seat at 22–18, and a 
Cal Poly error awarded the set to 
the Tritons at 25–19. Now with a short 15-point fifth set to come, getting on a lengthy run would be 
even more important in deciding 
this match.The teams started neck and neck, with each team visibly 
having fun and showing great determination. With the score at 7–7, the weight of each point was becoming obvious to each team. 
The back and forth continued, and the match was still up for 
the taking as the Tritons took an 
11–10 lead on a kill from McInnes. But it would be Cal Poly that had the last run of this match in their 
pocket, as they uncorked a timely 
5–1 run to take the set 15–12, and with it the match. An emotional 
loss for the Tritons was the result, but one can’t help but see a bright future for this young squad.
Though the match result 
was not the win that was both 
desired and attainable based on 
the performance, Coach Ricci 
Luyties should be impressed with the performance of these young Tritons under duress in a hostile 
environment. Next, the Tritons 
will be the hosts at RIMAC arena against California State University, 
Northridge on Friday, Oct. 29 at 7 p.m.
