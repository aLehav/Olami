A eucalyptus tree crashed into 
the side of Thurgood Marshall 
Apartments Building C around 4 p.m. Monday, shattering a window and puncturing the wall. Police and fire officials responded shortly after and evacuated the building. 
Although tree branches broke 
a woman’s bedroom window, Thurgood Marshall Resident Dean Y olanda Trevino said no bodily injury occurred as a result of the accident. 
“We were fortunate that we did not have any injuries as well as [only] minor damage, ” Trevino said. “If [the tree] had leaned more and the trunk had fallen on the building, it would have taken out all the apartments because of the weight. ”
According to Steve Thompson, 
associate director of maintenance, housing and dining, the tree branches hit a length of piping on the ou tside 
of the building, damaging a fire sprin-kler system that serves two bedrooms and punching a hole through the wall. 
Assistant Director of Facilities 
Management Charles Morgan said the damage was a result of internal decay mostly at the base of the tree and most likely caused by a fungus.
“With the right circumstances 
 — the right wind, right weight on the tree — it could happen to any tree anywhere in San Diego County, ” Morgan said. “There’s almost no real signs. We could never know until it falls down and we look inside. ”
Trevino said the three residents 
whose rooms were damaged have been temporarily relocated to other open spaces in Thurgood Marshall 
College and are expected to return to their rooms by Friday.

The UC Board of Regents appoint-
ed two new chancellors last week at 
UC San Francisco and UC Davis.
UCSF Chancellor-designate Susan 
Desmond-Hellmann and UC Davis Chancellor-designate Linda Katehi — both appointed based on UC President Mark G. Yudof ’s recom-mendation — will take their posi-tions Aug. 3 and Aug. 17, respectively, after a year-long search for qualified candidates. 
They will replace UCSF’s J. 
Michael Bishop, who has served as chancellor since 1998, and UC Davis Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, who has presided since 1994.
“Both [Desmond-Hellmann and 
Katehi] are considered trophy chan-cellors, ” UC Office of the President spokesman Peter King said. “They’re a blend of academic leadership and managerial skills, and they’re bona fide scientists. ”
Desmond-Hellmann — who 
ranked 87th on Forbes magazine’s“100 Most Powerful Women in the World” last year — is the first woman to be named UCSF chancellor and will receive a $450,000 annual salary, 
up from Bishop’s $402,200 salary.
The 51-year-old chancellor-desig-
nate earned  her medical degree at the 
University of Nevada, Reno before No injuries reported 
after 90-foot-tall eucalyptus breaks through undergrad’s window.

The freshly seated A.S. Council has 
its sights set on an A.S. student store, 
which it hopes to unveil in Spring Quarter 2010 before the Sun God Festival rush. 
The store would carry A.S.- and 
Greek-related merchandise to pro-mote council events like Bear Gardens, and give fraternities and sororities a convenient location to buy letters. 
“Students like to identify with 
icons that are a part of their student life and we are working to capital-ize on that, ” A.S. Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch said. “With the proposed steady flow of income from Greek apparel, it is a very responsible way to lower student fees by capitalizing on student needs. ”
According to Benesch, the bear 
mascots created by the A.S. Graphic Studio are wildly popular, and he said he believes apparel with the images would sell.
“When we put up the bear post-
ers on campus, they would be stolen in a couple hours, ” he said. “People thought they were so cute. That is also a consistent trend with the baby Sun 
Gods. ”
In addition to improving A.S. 
Council visibility and promoting cam-
pus community, A.S. President Utsav Gupta said the enterprise would yield a profit for the council, reducing its dependence on the quarterly $47.82 activity fee that students pay.Although the council has discussed 
an A.S. store for years, the idea gained momentum when councilmembers realized the Price Center expansion would provide space for the venture. Gupta said there is currently no busi-ness model for such an enterprise.
“The business plan needs to be 
tackled, and made sure that it is prof-itable both fiscally and economically, ” Gupta said.
Benesch said he will draft this plan 
over the summer and begin talks with 
University Centers — which oversees 
Price Center’s retail space — at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2009. He estimated that the issue would not reach the council floor for discussion until three or four weeks into the quarter. University Centers Advisory Board 
President Lana Blank said the best retail spot to support the Greek com-munity is the location of the A.S. Programming Office’s current Sun God mini-store, between the box office and Jamba Juice.
“It would make sense to have the 
A.S. store there because lots of Greek activity happens in the center of cam-pus, but it is also an expensive place [in terms of rent] compared to most, ” Blank said.
The council will use retail statis-
tics from the Sun God mini-store to 
determine which merchandise would 
sell best in the permanent enterprise, Benesch said.

completing her residency at UCSF. 
She also served as an assistant profes-sor of hematology and oncology at UCSF for two years. 
“The most 
important thing to me throughout my entire career … has been to work on things that truly matter for patients, and this new role has the potential to make an even larger impact on patients through all aspects of UCSF’s mis-sion, ” Desmond-Hellmann said in a statement.
She joined Genentech, a leading 
biotechnology corporation,  as a clini-
cal scientist in 1995, and was named executive vice president of develop-ment and product operations in 1999. Her annual salary at Genentech was $725,666, not including $1.3 million she earned in bonuses.
“[Desmond-Hellmann] took a big 
pay cut to come back to a place that changed her life, ” King said.
UCSF is currently finalizing plans 
for the construction of a new hospital in Mission Bay to serve children, women and cancer patients.
“Susan has the 
credentials to help ensure that the uni-versity [is a] major player in reshaping the nation’s health-care environment, ” Yudof said in a statement. “ And she has the know-how and leadership skills to make sure the Mission Bay hospital is a suc-cess. ” 
UC Davis Chancellor-designate 
Katehi, 55, is the current provost and vice chancellor of academic affairs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
Prior to joining UIUC, Katehi was 
the John A. Edwardson dean of engi-neering at Purdue University, and the associate dean for academic affairs at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. “She is a brilliant academic with 
experience at three Big-10 universi-ties, ” Yudof said. “She understands the mission and aspirations of a mul-tidisciplinary, land-grant institution … and she comes from the UC fam-ily. ”
Katehi will earn $400,000 annu-
ally as the UC Davis chancellor, a 12.4 percent increase from the current $356,00 she makes at UIUC and an 
$85,000 increase from her predeces-sor’s salary.
Katehi earned a bachelor’s degree 
in electrical engineering from the National Technical University in Athens, Greece, and received both her master’s degree and doctorate 
from UCLA ’s electrical engineering department.
She has received 16 U.S. pat-
ents, and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. Katehi was also selected by former President George W . Bush to chair the National Medal of Science com-mittee.
Both Katehi and Desmond-
Hellmann will receive university-pro-vided housing and an $8,916 annual automobile allowance. In addition, Katehi will be given a $100,000 relo-cation allowance.

The newly elected A.S 
Council’s inagural meet-ing was a welcoming and 
instructional affair.
Shanna Dayan  of the Student 
Health Advocates presented the “Sun God Says” campaign, and brought a box full of T-shirts as a gift to incoming councilmembers. The T-shirts, designed by the A.S. Graphic Studio, bear catchy phrases including “Who you gonna call ... A.S. Safe Rides. ”
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny 
Rue greeted the 
new council and offered a presen-tation chock full of wise words for the new council.
“My aspira-
tion for every student is that you have a niche, that you have a group of people you bond with — your peeps if you will, ” Rue said. “It’ d be great if A.S. can be a bonding group for you, but it’s also to reach out to create new alliances, to create part-nerships where partnerships didn’t exist before. ”
For the council’s benefit, 
Associate Vice President of Student Advocacy Frank Carroll handed out 
plastic water bottles that listed the “Top 5 things you should know if you are questioned/arrested at Sun God” before he played a 15-minute instructional DVD on knowing your rights as an individual and how to deal with police. 
The information and bottles 
come at a welcome time, given that a council resolution passed earlier this year decrying the use of disposable water bottles prompted a decision by A.S. Concerts and Events not to  distribute free water bottles at this year’s festival.A.S. Speaker Jordan Taylor 
added the appointment of his suc-cessor to new business and proceed-ed to pander his current position by listing his various duties.
Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund and former Revelle College Council Chair James Lintern both 
graciously accepted their nomina-tions for the job. Then each made his case to be voted on by the council. 
Haglund cited his experience 
in helping to construct the by-laws within Pi Kappa Alpha and 
his involvement with Judicial Affairs on the InterFraternity Council. He explained that he would increase  council efficiency 
by cutting down on the side chatter in the A.S. Forum.
Lintern listed his own experi-
ences — serving on Revelle College Council, serving on the Standing Rules committee and the Gaza Resolution Committee, and the two times he stepped in for an absent Taylor. Since he is not a member of the council, he would not have a vote if there were a tie.
“College chairs are very used to 
not choosing sides, ” Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Lana 
Blank  pointed out in the discussion 
that followed each nominee’s pre-sentation.
After the council’s brief delibera-
tion, Lintern re-entered the forum to the news and appropriate applause that he had been elected to the posi-tion.
During open forum Campuswide 
Senator Alex Vu encouraged every-
one to prepare for the ninth week budget meeting and to stay informed via the e-mail listserv.

this merchandising is for Sun God and build off that success, ” he said. “With an A.S. store, we could see what’s working well and what’s in our busi-ness interest for the future. ”
Benesch said he envisions keep-
ing the enterprise student run, since paying for a professional managerial position would pose a huge financial burden.
Gupta added that if students 
remain in charge of business opera-tions, there will be financial incentives for student customers to support the shop.
“It’s a student-run enterprise, 
meaning that any profits generat-ed by the store would go back to the student body in some way or form, ” he said. “It’s different from the Bookstore because the profit gener-ated there isn’t seeing a return to the student body. ”
Benesch said the council’s initial 
investment in shelving units, sig-nage, merchandise and advertising for the store would cost roughly $150,000.

Dear Editor,
I am a junior at UCSD, currently 
studying abroad in Padova, Italy.
A decision was recently made 
to close the Education Abroad 
Program study center in Padova at the end of June. I, along with the other UC students studying in Padova and the ladies who work in the study center, are very upset about this decision, and I feel it is news that should be presented to the UCSD community. 
For starters, despite numerous 
suggestions made by the study cen-ter’s employees (including cutting their hours and two of the four staff members) the UC system has decided that the most “economically feasible” option is to close the center altogether.
This decision was announced 
only after students had made depos-
its and arrangements to come to 
Padova next fall. Next fall, only one employee will work in the study center, and she will be entirely responsible for the work that four employees took on this year. 
The students going to Padova in 
the fall have been deceived. They will pay the same amount that I am paying right now, but will receive 
almost none of the support or ben-
efits of having a fully operational study center.
The study center is an integral 
part of the study-abroad experience. The ladies there help students with mundane tasks (such as telling us where we can find a hair straight-ener, or what a certain medicine might be called in Italian), to real-ly important issues (psychological issues, transferring units and classes from the University of Padova to our home campuses and many more things).
One lady told us that a few 
years ago, a student was robbed on Christmas, and she drove an hour to pick her up and take her back to her house, give her some money and help her through that tough experience.
These ladies really care about us, 
and they make us feel more at home in a foreign country. It’s a good feel-ing to know that even though you are on your own in a foreign coun-try, there is still someone looking out for you.
It is impossible for one woman to 
do all of this (plus organize accom-modations, help with class sched-ules, explain the Italian university system, etc.) for 30 students.
There is more than just finances 
going into this decision. 
The office space that the Padova 
study center uses is rent-free, as the office is owned by the University of Padova. Therefore, the University of California is only paying for four salaries (three of which are part-time).
Padova must be one of the more 
economically viable EAP programs as there is clearly no lack of interest 
in the program. Many UC students are coming to Padova in the fall, 
with Italian students going to UC campuses in their place.
If you have any questions, please 
don’t hesitate to e-mail me, or check out the Save the EAP Padova Center Facebook group.

Dear Editor,
Delivering pizzas to the One 
Miramar Street graduate student housing complex is always a frus-trating experience. I have yet to find the desired address within one drive down the street. It often takes a back-and-forth flashing of the brights on a couple of startled grads to locate the four wooden numbers. 
Dim yellow lights in cheap bul-
bous spheres leak a thin sheet of comfort on the apartments. The shrubs, grassy knolls, gravelly driveways and cracked concrete walkways weave in and out of the splotchy luminance.
Walking across the lawn, I real-
ized two things. One: the grass had recently been watered (damn my 
hole-ridden work shoes). Two: this 
would be a good place to rape some-body. 
Where there is darkness, there is 
a greater likelihood of illicit activ-ity. The grad student housing is dark, dingy and damp. When a five-minute pizza drop off gets me look-ing behind my back (no matter how neurotic I might be by nature), I take that as a sign there is a definite problem to be addressed.  
Grad students aren’t the only 
ones in danger, either.
A lot of undergraduate students 
walk from the east and Regents parking lots to their homes around University Town Center, and that entire edge of campus is a poorly lit catwalk of young collegians. Take your pick, creepy hat-wearing guy from the campus alert drawings,  it’s a smorgasbord of potential victims!   
So now I’ll put forth a solution: 
Install some fluorescent bulbs near that street and around the grad stu-dent housing!
To protect the safety and com-
fort of our own (namely the women who live here), I’m sure the univer-sity will agree that we can spare no expense.

*LU[LY:OV\SK:[H`6WLUThe Sun God Festival is tomor-row! This year’s bash comes in the wake of a festival over-
haul, the likes of which students were largely unhappy with. But the A.S. Concerts and Events Office has made some much-needed tweaks — like getting rid of that damned be-there-by-7-p.m. requirement and replacing it with all-day in-and-out privileg-es. And booking a lineup that takes a grand step toward the pages of Sun God lore, with an all-around increase in entertainment and, acts that students can get excited about. Not only did Concerts and Events prepare what will surely be the best dance party RIMAC Field has seen in far too long, the office lovingly — or perhaps just fearing riots — has transformed the weeks leading up to this Friday into a snowballing count-down party.
By calling upon the new A.S. 
Graphic Studio and social-network-ing Web site Twitter to bring momen-tum to the baby Sun God campaign, and planning a week of Price Center nooner shows, Concerts and Events has crafted an unprecedented pref-estival buzz. And its promise is one that the office looks to follow through on, collaborating with the Loft for fixtures like a cupcake tree, film tent and free photobooth, and with the Music Saves Lives group to set up a Motion City Soundtrack meet-and-greet in exchange for Wednesday’s blood drive. Concerts and Events has also embraced the student-fostered tradition of wearing a costume to campus the day of Sun God; there will be a “secret spotter” scanning the crowd, and those with the best outfit will be invited to dance on stage with Girl Talk.
But the changes could also mean 
some kinks. Festival wristbands (which will be made of fabric and ooze with hipstery slick-designed hipness) will be passed out all day at the tennis courts on Ridge Walk. And while Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Garrett Berg is confident that the 24-lane setup will be prepped to handle any line with robotic efficiency, students can believe it when they see it. With a capacity of about 20,000, the field admittedly isn’t big enough for every-one and guest tickets sold out on Tuesday. So students who have their heart set on seeing N.E.R.D and Girl Talk should hit up the wristband sta-tion early, just in case. 
The Coachella-esque Bring Y our 
Own Bottle campaign could pose another problem for parched con-certgoers. Berg’s office is making a noble effort to go green and stay in line with the council’s recent plastic-bottle-banning resolution, but this will demand that students do their part. 
Plan ahead and bring your own 
bottle — an empty one, yeah security will be checking — for free fill-ups, or be ready to pay $2 for some bottled hydration. But don’t worry; as a last resort the festival’s medical tents will have plenty of free water to go around if you find yourself feeling faint and without a canteen. 
While you’re planning ahead, 
keep in mind that the smartest kind of debauchery is best. So stay hydrat-ed, and if you’re stopped by a cop be cooperative and calm — remember that once you’ve adequately identified yourself, you have the right to remain silent. When the clock strikes mid-night and it comes time to relocate to the afterparty, shuttles will be run-ning until 1 a.m. and A.S. Safe Ride is always an option.
Ultimately though, the Sun God 
Festival is about campus commu-nity and collegiate camaraderie, not what’s planned for RIMAC Field. The Student Center will be just as bump-ing if not more so, with a block party centered around KSDT Radio’s Shun God. I-House is just waiting to become a stretch of Euro-dance-fueled mini parties. And the Koala ’s 
annual Sun God Lawn Slip-N-Slide (plus a soap-foamed Price Center fountain, if administrators don’t put the kibosh on that tradition like they did last year) are reason enough to incorporate bathing gear into your dance costume. 
Get ready — it’s going to be epic.

Last week, a newly minted U.S. Senate subcommittee con-vened to hear expert testimony 
regarding a worrisome matter. No, it wasn’t about the economic crisis, swine flu or the war in Iraq, but on something in which many would argue our government should have no say: the future of journalism. 
The fledgling Communications, 
Technology and the Internet subcom-mittee heard evidence from journalis-tic entities such as David Simon (for-mer Baltimore Sun  reporter and pro-
ducer of “The Wire”), David Moroney (publisher and chief executive offi-cer of the Dallas Morning News ) and 
Arianna Huffington (co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington 
Post) concerning the recent wholesale 
slaughter of newspaper staffers due to a dearth of advertising dollars, both online and in print.
At the moment, a central issue 
with journalism — which, by the way, arrived long before the glob-al economy took a dive  — is that 
newspapers, w
hich once offered very 
lucrative advertising spaces, are now at the bottom of the list. As people turn to the Internet for information, the amount of available advertising money spreads more thinly by the day. 
Unfortunately, now that the 
Internet provides ways for advertis-ers to push their product cheaply and effectively, there simply isn’t enough money supporting large news sites. 
This makes it difficult for previ-
ously profitable outlets to continue reporting at the level that was once possible. As reporters are handed pink slips and international bureaus fade silently away, we are in danger of existing without access to reliable information about the world around us.
I continue to read the reports of 
severe declines in advertising rev-enue in the New York Times itself — 
because I trust its ethics, the quality of the writing, and because a news-paper with such a stellar reputation should not have to bow down before the advertising gods as they sell their souls to snag an editorial mention. 
While the Times continues to 
report that it is losing money, readers are waiting for the paper to realize that this isn’t going to change. The rose-colored glasses need to come off — even when the economy turns around, advertisers still won’t be flinging dollar bills their way just because of the popular name. 
With sites about every topic on 
(and off) the planet, advertisers are no longer required to shell out the big bucks to put their name on a site 
— like the Times — simply because 
of its large readership. Instead of get-
ting thousands of views because of an expensive front-page ad, a company who wants you to buy skateboards can instead pay a number of home-grown sites a pittance to display its ads.
The Internet doesn’t devalue the 
traditional brands, it just — in true EDITORIAL

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro
democratic fashion — lends cre-
dentials to every 14-year-old with dreams of designing her own boards by allowing her to set up a snazzy-looking site for consumers to stumble across.
The important aspect isn’t that 
anybody and their pet cat can put up a Web site; the digital Holy Grail occurs when such a site develops a substan-tial, devoted following and is snapped up by a recognizable brand name because of its content and readers. 
Take Jane Everywoman’s expert 
blog on do-it-yourself home renova-tion, add it to a recognizable Web site run by an established brand such as Time Inc. ’s Real Simple magazine, and you’re on your way to attracting that specific customer for whom ad executives are searching. 
But what does all this online mar-
keting blather have to do with hard-hitting journalism? The answer lies in the hybrid model of news distribu-tion that Huffington described dur-ing the Senate hearing. Sites like the Huffington Post  make use of bloggers, 
celebrities and household names to increase site traffic. 
But editors and reporters are 
absolutely essential to maintaining accurate journalism, and as fun as the Huffington Post ’s Hollywood updates 
may be, someone still needs to report the hard-hitting facts.
While  Times  journalist Nicholas 
D. Kristof is known best for his unique global columns, he also holds an annual contest through the Times  
Web site where he selects an applicant to travel with him as he investigates his next piece. People didn’t apply for this contest because they think the Times corporation is the be-all and 
end-all of existence. They applied because they’re gung-ho about learn-ing from such a knowledgeable fel-low.
While it will be tougher for news 
writers to develop the same kind of following because of the necessarily objective nature of their chosen for-mat, you bet that a reporter blogging from Afghanistan is going to get a serious number of people interested in his perspective. 
I’m not advocating the overthrow 
of the reporter by the masses of blog-gers. Quite the opposite. As news organizations are finally forced — as I believe they should be — to loosen their grip on information gathering and distribution, they will have to recognize that alongside investiga-tive journalists, other information can be distributed by talented writers through their sites without a compro-mise in quality. 
Don’t lose the journalists; just 
m a k e  s u r e  t o  a l s o  t a k e  a d v a n t a g e  of other talent out there and use it to enhance the experience of visit-ing a top-notch news site. Keep (or hire back) talented editors to ensure that content remains at the highest level while the online destination is customized to keep consumers both informed and interested. 
As Huffington stated during 
the hearing, it’s not about making newspapers work again. It’s about maintaining journalistic standards of integrity and accuracy, while still accepting the fact that information, and the power that comes with it, is no longer held solely in the fist of the publishing pooh-bahs of yesteryear. 
Unsurprisingly, the Senate meet-
ing concluded without any firm deci-sions. Even so, the multitude of pos-sible models left a feeling that while newspapers may be going, journalism — in all its iterations — is undoubt-edly here to stay, even as it explores novel ways to connect with news consumers like you and me.

Iron & Wine
By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer
&.E.R.D was on everyone’s Sun God 
radar through Fall and Winter Quarters — and this spring, for once, the rumors manned up and hit the 
lineup. That’s right: This time tomorrow, we’ll be froth-ing and mothing toward a proud RIMAC spotlight on the great Pharrell Williams, international guru of making cute things cuter by cartooni-fying them (A.S. ’s baby Sun Gods, pictured on the right, fall creepily in line) and origi-nal imagineer of making space for white-hot pace in the club beat. 
Less anticipated 
— to say the least — was this year’s choice for principal non-hip-hop act. Samuel Beam, grandfatherly singer-songwriter behind stage-name Iron and Wine, has lingered in the lower, slower tips of the nation ever since his South Carolina childhood — and it shows.
He’s like an escaped wisp of cirrus cloud, sort of 
curious to see about love but still bored, stopping for a second to look pee-colored in the California sunset but not really caring. In fact, it’ d be a sturdy bet to wager he’s never been excited enough to make his beard move (aside from an emotional tickle in that moment when those notorious freckles aligned).
UNCAGE YOURSELF
By Edwin Gonzalez
Associate Hiatus Editor
!n case you can do with-out the swarms of punch-drunk classmates amassing 
at RIMAC Field, KSDT is offering a fiercely independent alternative. 
“zOMG it’s SHUN GOD” — the 
station’s first annual Sun God Festival supplement — is being hosted by the scene-savvy folks at UCSD’s own radio station from 11:45 a.m. until 6 p.m. Just south of the Sun God statue itself, the grassy knoll outside the KSDT studio (right next to Hi Thai) will be bustling with live bands, face-painting, skinny jeans, temporary tattoos and an all-day dance floor. 
 Think of it as Sun God’s backyard block party. “We wanted to present students with an alternative to Sun God 
that’s got different genres, ” KSDT Programming Director Anna Huang said. “ And [gives] more exposure [to] independent artists. ”
While most were elated upon recognizing the big names pep-
pering this year’s official lineup, the organizers behind Shun God are ditching the hip-hop and mainstream rock monopoly for unsigned garage bands and local artists, ea ch of whom will fill out a 
30-minute set. As a result, the performers won’t be seeing any pay-checks from A.S. Concerts and Events. KSDT can rely on cost-free 
experimentals like Zsa Zsa Gabor and M&M Blues — and grad stu-dents like the simply named Dylan — 
to win them a musical diversity badge. 
Caxton, the most Billboard-
friendly of the nine-piece line up, is a Palm Springs quartet that throws quite the Rilo Kiley silhouette. The band, which performed for the station’s last Fierce Friday Studio Session, will take the Shun God stage at 3:15 p.m. with a full, porcelain bawl more akin to Deborah Harry than Jenny Lewis. 
If a one-girl, three-guy indie act is 
still too same-old, then ATOMS might ring your bell. Performing at 5:30 p.m., the group’s got a Hot Snakes sound spliced with low-fi thrash and roots-rock beneath their lead’s scruffy squawk. 
Of course, if you want to take cover completely, the KSDT 
studio is doubling as a dance cabin. With deejays stacked for six one-hour shifts inside, Shun God’s willing to vie with any white tent Girl Talk can throw at them. (Situated in the Student Center, the folks at KSDT are well aware of Porter’s Pub’s key alcohol-dispensing proximity. As a result, the staff on site will also be acting as security at the door.)
“With the old Student Center being so separated from Sun God 
and the whole RIMAC-ification of the party, we’re just trying to bring some change, ” Huang said. 
The Che Cafe will also be hosting an $8 lineup of live bands 
after the Shun God event, at 7 p.m.What’s Sun God When

,hings are getting awfully hip around here.
The A.S. Sun God T-shirts are superim-
posed onto pantless American Apparrel models 
(props for the pantlessness, flops for pulling a Clean Slate). Lady Dottie and the Diamonds just climbed from their Gaslamp dugout to come play Price Center. We, come Sun God, are going to be able to climb into art trees on RIMAC Field and attach munchie orders onto ziplines made to deliver our every craving to some philanthropic chef on the 
other end, who’s apparently taken up the cause of feeding 
fucked-up college kids.
Gary Ratcliff and Penny Rue have Facebook.
But somehow, amid all this aw esomess, I have still found 
a reason to complain. Have you ever noticed how much things suck when they’re dry? The only element of Sun God that the administration is really resisting this year is water — god forbid we, and their precious lawns, get too wet. Garrett Berg and the team have given us Girl Talk, but the rest is up to you. Break out the super soakers. Find a loose screw in the fire hydrant. And a way into that goddamn fountain.
Even though the RIMAC assholes don’t want their 
muddy weed patch to get (gasp!) more muddy, and have not allowed for any sort of water sport in the main cage, there are hundreds of faucets on this campus. Just have faith, and follow the Sun God. I’ll see you there.SIMONE  ELECTRA  WILSON

navan's noise, like their 
name, falls just short of sounding the same for-
ward and backward.
In fact, it’s is even better in reverse, 
jumbling all those painfully obnoxious love-note lyrics written specially for the band by a tortured fifth grader or brooding middle-school dropout.Despite the scratchy, desperate 
screeches of lead vocalist and drummer Aaron Buckly (which his bandmates mimic on their instruments), Anavan does have one trick: keyboardist Molly Williams. When she takes the mic, they’re transformed from spazzcore leftovers to hard-candy pop — an unlikely relief. "The Perfect Sound," though far from perfect, is Anavan at their apex, so geniously built for doing 
the robot that any other form of dance 
doesn't even have room to occur. 
Anavan should normally be avoid-
ed, but this is Sun God, so join me under the bottle and next to the stage, dancing the meanest robot ever.By Sonia Minden

omposed of pool-party crasher Pigeon John and his good pal Flynn, Rootbeer’s 
unhinged goofiness is caught some-where between old-school Black Eyed Peas and cheap-shot hooks (when Fergie climbed on board). The duo’s 2009 Pink Limousine EP is 20 minutes 
of straight whiplash, and its title track is predictably over the top with a repeti-tive chorus turned whoopfest — less funk and more frolic. Likewise, the beat tries for unfussy and ends up toddlers with silverware, albeit nice and ’80s.
“So Good” finds Pigeon doing what 
he does best — speak-rapping school-boy worship for a lady friend (“She’s the sunshine/ I’m the moonlight/ We need each other like a blanket on a cold night”). But then, a strangling hook squelches all the groove in one deflating grip: “Feels so good/ Feels so great/ Feels so wonderful to be with you. ” Over and over again. Y eah — not feeling it.
Girl
Talk

Senior Staff Writer
ragments of songs run 
rampant through a maze of looped guitar solos and displaced 
lyrics. Some are razor-thin, mutilated beyond recognition and gone before you know it. Others are long, drawn-out and slow — like fat drops of sweat creeping down a hyphy club rat’s face, taking her makeup with it. A little Zeppelin here, a touch of Beyonce there, then “BOOTY , BOOTY , BOOTY” as Bubba Sparxxx kicks down the door and belts misogynistic come-ons to all the ladies in the house.
It’s directionless. It’s unexpected. 
It’s a little bit wrong. But goddamn if it doesn’t sound like pure magic. And that writhing orgy of provocative sound bytes, subtly mismatched bass lines and fleeting slivers of catchy-ass shit you swear you’ve heard before will envelop an isolated corner of campus this Friday when Girl Talk stages a manic coup d’ etat  on the 2009 Sun God 
Festival.
When listening to Girl Talk (aka 
Greg Gillis, biomedical engineering student turned dancehall messiah), it’s easy to forget that what you’re hearing is a mash-up. His tracks are unbe-lievably fluid at times: Big-hair rock ballads frolic symbiotically with soul-ful, gospel-inspired caterwauling, and the Pixies’ ethereal guitar riffs become a distorted car-stereo soundtrack for your midafternoon Compton drive-by. At other moments, it’s like listening to a scratched Huey Lewis vinyl played way too loudly over a broken barroom jukebox that skips unpredictably every few seconds, jumping violently from blues to hip-hop to grunge.
His creations are chaotic and defiant 
of any form, yet inexplicably melodi-ous. There’s little time to stop and think about all the pieces — the subtle piano chords, the garbled moans, the rapid-fire succession of signature Michael Jackson shrieks. With Girl Talk, there is only the sum of the parts, derived from hours of careful sampling, splicing and mixing, backed by a dual apprecia-tion for sickeningly overplayed pop and little-known indie fare.
DJ Funk’s “Pump that Shit” melts 
seamlessly into the Cranberries’ “Dreams. ” Elton John walks hand-in-hand with the Notorious B.I.G. to the tune of “Tiny Dancer. ” Then, without a trace of irony, Rick Springfield wails his love for “Jessie’s Girl” as Three 6 Mafia 
discuss a partiality toward oral sex. 
Girl Talk gives life to an army of 
fucked-up patchwork ragdolls, exposes 
them to a pile of radioactive bargain-bin cassette tapes and then turns them loose in a bizarre, brightly lit city popu-lated by washed-up one-hit wonders and chart-topping glam-rap superstars. It’s not quite rock, not quite rap and never quite coherent, but inarguably 
danceable as fuck. Just don’t call him

!magine a dreary sonic storm descending on RIMAC Field, a cascade 
of eerie, thumping beats drenched in static. Behold Nosaj Thing, a producer from L.A. specializing in experimental electronica supposedly fused with hip-hop — although the latter’s influence is all but buried beneath the rough, untamed exterior of computer-generat-ed chaos. “1685 Bach” cloaks the faint-est vestige of a danceable tune with a digital avalanche of ideas.
A veteran of L.A. ’s underground 
deejay scene, Thing’s MySpace resume is heavy on the accolades and short 
on substance: His only commercially 
distributed comp is a five-song EP more than two years old, titled Views/Octopus (the full-length version is slated for June). He’s the polar flip of dance-tent headliner GirlTalk, for-saking any pretentions at pleasing the crowd in favor of showcasing mysti-cal home cooking. Try to perk up for “ Aquarium, ” which revels in a skillful 
— if unfriendly — sample of whispered 
mutterings.

part from his overtouted spot in the now defunct Jurassic 5, there isn’t a lot 
of buzz on this bearded  cat. Nu-Mark 
began spinning in L.A. as a teenager for small-time house parties, but it wasn’t until he hit Boston venue the Good Life  
that he met the Rebels of Rhythm and Unity Committee, along with crowd-favorite Cut Chemist — thus birthing the West Coast’s beloved J5.
Nu-Mark went on two solo for-
ays in 2004: one collab with SoCal beatsmith Pomo, and one placid mix tape rife with smooth guitar, piano and Oriental woodwind — a tribute to the days of cozy vinyl that solidified him as the mild man’s alternative to Cut Chemist’s quirks. All we know since J5 went AWOL in 2007 is that Nu-Mark has a full-fledged solo in the works — with savvy guests and a  booming 
commercial release — and that you’ d be apt to brush up on your J5 trivia by Friday to impress that mellow hip-hop head nodding sleepily to Nu-Mark’s set.

,he weather is perfect, con-
cession attendants are set-ting out the kettle corn and 
Kuncocshun staffers are yelling into their walkie-talkies as the Theory of Funkativity drives across the field. Two beat-up compacts and an SUV roll right over the power cords before com-ing to a stop, and Theory’s four mem-
bers step out to face a beefy, belligerent 
and bald technician with a rock star’s nonchalance.
Student vocalist Pat Cleary, guitar-
ist Michael Perl, bassist Kyle Burkle and drummer Sean Brust aim beyond stardom: They sat down and told me they want everyone to “start listening to good music again. ” No more machine, 
they said, cranking out hits you’ll forget 
a month later. 
Apparently, Theory’s up-tempo 
funk-rock is the good music that’s going By Sonia Minden

!f you think about it, Motion City Soundtrack and UCSD are a lot alike. There’s a 
sense that Soundtrack could someday see the fame of playground pop-punk-ers Blink-182 or Fall Out Boy, if only they stretched a little bit further and wrote that perfect song with the just the right balance of moog and cool to burn up the Billboard. Instead — like UCSD, in a third-place jog behind the beefier northern UCs — the quintet remains just out of MTV’s monolithic reach, despite a handful of near hits and an impressive Japanese fan base.
OK, that’s not exactly true.

,he Midwest has been doing us right. From the classic Common to superegoed 
Kanye to geeky Lupe, the red states have grown some of the freshest devel-opments in contemporary hip-hop.
After quickly catching fire from the 
Chicago celebration candles, the Cool Kids have mainstream heads doing a double take. Born from an online MySpace marriage inspired by golden-age hip-hop, ruler-sharp Mikey Rocks of Chicago and super-funky Chuck Inglish of Detroit have been pumping 
out swag since 2005. They’ve written a 
small but solid catalogue based entirely on the sorely missed hip-hop blueprint of yore — their debut EP , Totally Flossed  
Out, makes no attempt to hide it. Slyly Motion City
Soundtrack

Staff Writer
$ong before the whimsical 
chords of “Boston” came to score Y ouTube how-to vid-
eos everywhere, Augustana debuted Midwest Skies and Sleepless Mondays.
Haven’t heard of it? No pressure: 
It plunked into obscurity without so much as a shaky wail from Dan Layus’s overplayed voice. 
So how did they end up wooing 
Epic? By moving to San Diego, of course, to soak up chillaxed rock like starved Midwestern loofahs and turn out All the Stars and Boulevards .
Augustana doesn’t look like a SoCal 
band: Their black pea coats over oxford button-ups reflect an autumn that San Diego never feels, let alone under-stands. Moreover, the band tie-dyes their tunes with Americana appropri-ate to their sprung-from-Springfield history: When Layus isn’t crying “Y ou don’t know me, you don’t even care” in a boozy Orpheus voice, he’s mimicking Bob Dylan’s creepy old-man twang.
But googly eyed and love-riddled 
California tunes roll back in as conspic-uously as tidal waves, and Augustana 
don’t hesitate to shake their new beach 
hair to the tick of the metronome.  
Don’t expect mosh pits to break out 
on the muddy RIMAC Field during Augustana’s warbly “Sweet and Low. ” Instead, lay your dizzy head down and let their consuming piano-rock lull you to sleep. Y ou’re probably going to need the nap for N.E.R.D, and who knows? Augustana (with the help of some 
obligatory additives) just might make 
for some unbeatable dreams.By Allie Cuerdo

%idterms got you down? Sneezing up a storm in Geisel? It’s time to scan iTunes and choose the best possible cure. Y eah — let’s talk chick-rock. When all you need is a heavy dose of sunny sarcasm, fiery feminism, wedding-cake wishes and a taste of teen angst, look no further than Sara Bareilles — a sweet little brunette with an optimistic case of the love bug.
Born in Eureka, Calif. (just two 
hairs down from Oregon), the 29-year-old UCLA grad got her start in a capel-la groups and open mics. Soon, the coffeehouses got bigger and she was opening for Aqualung, Mika and her besties Maroon 5. Bareilles then signed with Epic for Little Voice , a solid 12 pack with five even-better live tracks. With diamonds like “Many the Miles” — a folksy soul treasure that hits notes like liquid sunshine — and the vintage AA confessional “Love On the Rocks, ” it’s easy to see what the label saw. 
Launching from a long tradition of 
independent women (Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, Alanis Morissette, Fiona Apple, Ingrid Michaelson and, um, Beyonce), Bareille’s “Love Song” quickly spiked No. 1 on the U.S. Pop 100 and stole two Grammy nods. Now, like a swine-flu antidote, she’s spread-ing to San Diego. Watch out — happy happens.

Party
By Allie Cuerdo
Associate Hiatus Editor
ll hail GOP! No, not the Republicans — experi-mental punk trio Grand 
Ole Party is way too hip for starched shirts and elephant ties. Instead, expect a liberal riot of urban plaid and anar-chist activism. (Like we didn’t see that coming.) Stereotypes abound on the college circuit, especially when every-thing indie looks and sounds eerily alike. Take this strange fruit: A little-known GOP scored a spot on the cur-rent Y eah Y eah Y eahs tour. Awesome, except — one girl with pale skin, red lips, bowl-cut black hair and a Karen O wail, two backing male mates on guitar and bass — notice a pattern? They’re an exact copy of YYY , only less endowed with, you know, fans.
GOP’s only hope lies in Kirstin 
Gundred. The mini-Karen’s simulta-neous singing/drumming is a show stealer for sore eyes: Timekeepers everywhere will be high-fiving percus-sion’s return to center stage. Though she can’t swing the mic like it’s an acrobatic lover or dive into a sweaty pit on the guitar solo, Gundred’s ceaseless shout thrashes with the best of them. “Love, lust, nasty/ Habits make us who we are/ Love, lust nasty/ Habits take us very far/ Underground” trembles like a silkier, insane Gwen Stefani — circa No Doubt, of course.

ENTRANCE TUNNEL
ILLUSTRATIONS  BY CHRISTINA  AUSHANA /GUARDIANWait — I think there’s a name 
for this strange kind of human. Oh, 
right. A fucking downer. 
And a thousands-strong herd of 
horny nerds who’ve been cooped up in a dark room with lab chemi-cals and laptops since September (FML) aren’t exactly equipped with the patience it takes to tolerate a downer. Each of the three whop-ping studio albums and two rarity/B-side/live snores that Beam’s got under his country buckle is piss full of happy-sad baby birdies too busy contemplating the sky to fly away.
“She says if I leave before you 
darling/ Don't you waste me in the ground/ I lay smiling like our sleep-ing children/ One of us will die inside these arms, ” he schmoozes o n  “ N a k e d  a s  W e  C a m e , ”  w h o s e  title seems Sun God-worthy enough until you realize it’s about tender, missionary love-making (need I quote 50 Cent here?).
We know the “real world” will 
suck, OK? Please, now, before my boner puddles into my party boots.
Indeed, all will be forgotten by 
nightfall. It’s actually creepy how cut out Williams and N.E.R.D-mates Chad Hugo and Shay Haley are for this job. Their clean chords and boy-next-door doodles aren’t much on paper, but helium into an exer-cise in energy when put to the amp. All that, and with a Neanderthalic minimalism that scratches all our evolutionary hard-to-reach spots.
Williams is a serial lady killer, 
one side of a hipster grin raised under elevator eyes, somehow never making the girls feel violated even when comparing their asses to ride-able spaceships — come on, he’s just here to please. Case in point, “Tape Y ou, ” from their dynamite debut: “I just want to see you come, ” “Nah, baby, don’t worry about your make-up, ” “Now go kiss her boobs, and you kiss her boobs too. ” Well put.
Hilarious fact: Turns out the 
N.E.R.D baby-face is more than a year older than grandfather willow in the 3 p.m. slot. Hmm ... must be something in the cartoon ice cream.
In any case, they’ve both got 
more grunt than Sean Kingston, who was somehow expected to bring 20,000 best-day-of-the-year hopefuls to climax on one (pretty hot) single alone. And, like T.I. the year before him (with “What Y ou Know”) he didn’t even bother to fin-ish singing the only song we knew. :<5.6+ ;/,<*:+. <(9+0(5 ;/<9:+(@ 4(@

From small family gatherings to large festivites, Pat & Oscar’s
offers customized event solutions perfect for every celebration. sampling the masterpieces of legendary 
duo Eric B. and Rakim, “Pump Up the Volume” cleverly cuts the latter’s famed lyric on “I Know Y ou Got Soul, ” and “What It Iz” injects a vibrant drum mea-sure with an eight-count beat from Eric B. ’ s “I Ain’t No Joke. ”
Sure, they’re up to their necks in fixies 
and sunglasses and everything hip, but they’ve got the swag to back it up: Beats as impeccably sparse as the Neptunes’ , and with better raps to boot. Plus, the duo just released mix tape Gone Fishing  (a 
collab with superproducer Don Cannon) as a free-and-easy download on their Web site, putting a modern spin on those block-party handouts back in the good old days. Best don your Tribe Called Quest tee, neon fitted cap and spit-shined dunks — then bump that dome to the best-baked rhythms on the block. RIDING BY THE OLD-SCHOOL RULEBOOK

BEGINNING 9 A.M.Kills Me landed the critics, finally gar-
nering Soundtrack some much-needed props. Singles like the bass-powered “This Is for Real” blew the same wind-in-hair bliss you get from driving your first car down the highway; “Fell in Love Without Y ou” mimics the pert spirit of 2003’s “The Future Freaks Me Out” but thankfully steers from the for-mer’s high-pitched bent while keeping squeaky-clean synth choruses intact. Though drawing from a history of worry-free bounce, the album reflected a more nuanced, versatile group — debted both to their newly grown-up sensibilities and a crowded guest list.
I asked bassist Matthew Taylor if 
there were any brawls in the Kills Me studio.“ Adam’s more of a pop guy, and Eli’s 
into the whole D.C. punk scene … so there was definitely an interesting mix of ideas, ” Taylor said carefully. “But Ric didn’t want to do anything to [our sound]. ‘Even If It Kills Me’ used to be a 15-second little ditty, and Ric extended it, put in a bridge and made it into a full-length track. So, yeah, it was a good experience all around. ”
Now that they’ve re-tailored their 
skinny jeans to account for the years, the Minnesota natives are recruiting Blink-182’s Mark H oppus for the stu-
dio, looking for a fresh release to propel them — once and for all — into the bedrooms of squealing preteens across the globe.
“It’s cool to work with a producer 
who’s been in your shoes, ” Taylor said. “He’s like a big brother who has really good advice … He keeps it light in the studio. Sometimes you can take your-self too seriously. ”
But it’s hard to imagine that 
Soundtrack ever take anything too seri-ously — even tongue-in-cheek lyrics on self-medication and pill popping are delivered with giddy enthusiasm on “Everything Is Alright. ” Taylor insists that the dark irony is intentional.
“We’re just happy dudes … with 
some not-so-happy moments, ” he said. 
Slowly but surely, the boys are 
breaking from short-lived commercial cameos and finding their place in the limelight. Nonetheless — like any one of us, procrastinating between seventh-week breakdowns — they know how to have a good fucking time doing it.

 to save the world. As technicians sound-
check with No Doubt’s “Hella Good, ” a funk revolution sounds pretty good. 
Confidence isn’t an issue for Theory 
— equipment is. When they arrived to 
Koncocshun, they were told there were no drum mics, no extension cords and that they would need to move their equipment off the stage afterward so the student orgs could dance.
With his right hand hidden from 
the bearer of bad news, drummer Sean Brust pulls the wanker.
They’ve got good reason to be con-
fident: Their self-titled release is a bona fide groove, with choruses aspiring to the freshness of idols the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Hip-swinging joints “Something to Say” and “Clean Cut” have plenty of attitude, and could eas-ily be local-radio staples. Pulling out blistering solos whenever the rest of the band unchains him, Perl makes good on the band’s promise to follow in the footsteps of Jimi Hendrix.
Live, though, that confidence is a vice. Perl thrashes and tweaks like Scooby-Doo on meth instead of snacks, unloading so much energy through the speakers that the groove is easily lost. For his part, Cleary refuses to leave the spotlight, and spends the solos leaning on Perl’s shoulder like Axl and Slash.But they have their moments: At 
Kuncocshun, their cover of the Peppers’ “Give It Away” drew everyone on the field, and when Cleary held the mic out to the crowd for the chorus, they yelled just as loud as if for the Peppers themselves.

Senior Staff Writer 
On Tuesday afternoon, 12 
Tritons were honored in an on-campus ceremony as part 
of National Student-Athlete Day. Two athletes were selected from each of the six colleges to receive recognition for their academic accomplishments while taking part in the often rigorous sched-ule demanded by UCSD athletics.
“I’m always trying to figure out 
how they can do all these things in a 24-hour period, ” said Director of Athletics Earl Edwards, who deliv-ered the keynote comments at the event. “Y ou look at practice sched-ules, you look at studying, you look at community service and many of them have jobs as well. They’re not only doing it, but they’re doing it extremely well. That’s the most impressive thing; that they’re suc-cessful at such a high level, manag-ing a lot of different things. ”
The honorees were accompanied 
by coaches and faculty members who made an impact on their respective careers. Each student athlete received a plaque for their accomplishments.
“I was very honored, ” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior Anne Schnecker said. Schnecker, a member  
of the fencing team, maintained a  3.9 
GPA while also helping the women’s fencing team to a conference champi-onship in 2009. 
“It wasn’t an award I was trying to 
win or anything, but I always try hard at anything I undertake, ” Schnecker said. “It meant a lot to me to get rec-ognized. ”
Sixth College junior Linda 
Rainwater, the current UCSD record-holder and California Collegiate Athletic Association champion in the heptathlon and high jump, was also honored.
“It’s hard to balance having long 
practices during the day, and then you’re tired when you get home, but you still have to do homework, ” Rainwater said. “It’s nice to get rec-ognized for your efforts, especially at UCSD where we have so many good student athletes. ”
In addition to Rainwater and 
Schnecker, honorees included Earl Warren College senior Kelvin Kim (men’s basketball); Warren College sophomore Jessica Ferguson (women’s swimming and diving); Thurgood Marshall College senior Leah Murphy (women’s track and field); Marshall College junior Vincent Nguyen (men’s tennis); John Muir College junior Nicole Saari (softball); Muir College junior Karam Badran (men’s crew); Revelle College senior Jessica McGovern (women’s soccer); Revelle College junior Tony Choi (men’s soc-
cer); Eleanor Roosevelt College junior Ian Bausback (men’s water polo) and Sixth College senior Bryan Dieffenbach (men’s track and field).
“What I’ d like all the students, 
faculty and staff to recognize is the commitment that the student athletes make, ” Edwards said. “It’s a commit-ment to the athletic program, it’s a commitment to the university and it’s a commitment to themselves, being the best that they can be. Those are the types of individuals that we all want to go on and contribute to society as a whole. ”

also convenes for an unofficial team bike ride — a 40-mile cycle through Encinitas and Rancho Santa Fe. 
With three sports to master, the 
focus of practices varies from one exercise to working on a combina-tion of the three. Team members can often be seen swimming laps at Canyonview Pool or doing a track workout. 
During races, however, there is no 
time for rest between sports. First-time triathletes are often shocked at how hard it is to transition from biking to running, or how weak their muscles feel as they begin to run. The team pre-pares for this with “bricks, ” a workout where athletes use stationary bikes and alternate between biking and running. 
“Our success really comes from the 
passion behind it, ” Kotturi said. “That passion leads to dedication and hard work, and that’s really key for us. ”
Several of the members, including 
Uyeda, emphasized that the team is not just for elite athletes. The triath-lon club is open to all UCSD students and does not make any cuts.
“The nice thing about being a club 
is that people can come in and put in as much time and effort as they want to, ” he said. “If someone is just starting out, we can’t kill them with several workouts a week. They need to build a good base first. ”
Brown echoed the sentiment that 
the sport is open to anyone who is willing to work for it. 
“The team welcomes every stu-
dent with open arms, regardless of athletic ability, ” Brown said. “We encourage everyone to come out, and the only thing we expect is to show up on time and give 100 percent. ” 
Many athletes compete in their 
first triathlon while on the team, including some top finishers. Most triathletes have a more extensive background in one of the sports; during that section of the race, they make up for time lost in other sec-tions. 
Sophomore Reina Kawazoe, a 
first-year team member, joined the team looking for a new challenge 
after swimming competitively for 10 years.
“I was so burnt from swimming, I 
needed something new and fresh, ” she said. “Tri gave me a chance to explore how far my body was willing to go. ”
Some of the team members com-
peted in other sports on the col-legiate level. Unlike NCAA sports, there is no limit on years of eli-gibility and, as a result, the team has several athletes that previously competed for the Tritons in swim-ming and track. The triathlon club provides a way for them to keep competing for UCSD while continu-ing their education.
While the team holds back-to-
back national champion titles on the women’s side, its members represent a vast range of skill and experience levels. Receiving little, if any, recog-nition, the triathlon club is quietly progressing as one of UCSD’s most prominent teams.

PLAYOFF PREVIEW
It’s a now or never  race. For the final regat-
ta before the NCAA Division-II National 
Championships, the Tritons will head 
to Sacramento for the Pacific Coast Rowing Championships with their season on the line.
“It’s our last chance to prove to the com-
mittee that we deserve to go [to nationals] for the fifth year in a row, ” senior co-captain Kelly Hansen said. “There is no more important of a race than this one. There are a lot of teams gunning for us since we’ve dominated in the past, but the end of the season is when we shine. That being said, the amount of pressure is definitely up there. But during a race, you can’t analyze your placement or look into the future. While we know we must perform well, stressing about it is only going to hinder our performance. We just have to go out there and row hard without thinking. ”
Coming off a slightly disappointing third-
place finish at the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship, women’s crew remains dedicated to its  task at hand, 
approaching the regatta with confidence.
“WIRA didn’t go as we had hoped, but 
the past is the past, ” senior co-captain Alissa Kispersky said. “We have since evaluated and changed our race strategy. Our team has to race a significantly faster time than we have done in the past … I know our team is entirely capable of racing at this level. We have done so in practice all year. All we have to do is apply that to a race scenario. ”
The conference finals will take place at 
Lake Natoma at 8 a.m., and the Tritons are eagerly awaiting the occasion.
“I think each and every one of us has our 
own particular strength that we bring to the boat, and it’s definitely going to come out this weekend, ” Hansen said. “The seniors especially will be bringing our determination, which includes our refusal to give up what we’ve built over the last four years. It’s going to be a regatta in which we truly see everyone’s heart and strength that this whole year has given us. I can’t wait. ”

Many UCSD students played a sport in high school, often trying a hand at two or three. Now imagine compet-
ing in three sports at one time, each with its own nuances and techniques. Scattered among us are several UCSD triathletes who are not only capable of swimming, biking and run-ning long distances without taking any rest in between — but who are also among the top collegiate triathletes in the country. 
The origins of the sport lie only a few miles 
south of campus: Mission Bay. With calm water, 14 miles of running paths and San Diego’s ever-sunny weather, it’s a favorite destination for endurance athletes nationwide. The pristine location gave these athletes a new trial ground. On Sept. 25, 1974, 46 participants competed in a 600-yard swim, five-mile run and five-mile bike in an event organized by the San Diego Track Club. 
Several students interested in bringing the 
sport to the university founded the triathlon club team in 1998. Born from San Diego’s cycling, swimming and running com-munities, the sport has found a  home at UCSD. 
“People are learning we 
have a team on campus, and we welcome anyone to the team, ” sophomore captain Sante Kotturi said. “We all really love tri and we want as many people as possible to share in that. ” 
The sport has expanded tre-
mendously since its start, debuting in the 2000 Olympic Games. UCSD’s team benefited from this exposure; it now has over 60 members, almost doubling in size over the last two years. 
UCSD competes in the West Coast 
Collegiate Triathlon Conference, which oper-ates under USA Triathlon, the sport’s national governing body. Despite its popularity, tri-athlon is not a NCAA-sanctioned sport, and very few colleges around the country fund their teams. Nevertheless, about 100 universi-ties compete nationwide; many teams support themselves by organizing their own triathlon 
annually. UCSD holds an event called the 
Tritonman, which takes place at the same loca-tion of the historic first triathlon in Mission Bay. 
“We get much, much less fund-
ing than NCAA teams do, ” vice presi-dent of the triathlon club Frank Uyeda said. “Typically, people put on triathlons both as a fundraiser and also as a competition. ”  Head coach Mac Brown emphasized the 
importance of student leadership on the team.
“I give the student athletes their workouts 
and basically act as a mentor, ” he said. “I’m always available to help the athletes with their 
training, but most of the administrative stuff and organizing for races is done by the stu-dents. ”
The collegiate triathlon season culminates 
in the USA Triathlon Collegiate National Championships, which were held in Lubbock, Texas, this year. The race is a standard Olympic distance triathlon, consisting of a 1.5 kilome-ter swim, 40 kilometer bike and 10 kilometer run. 
At this year’s event on April 18, the UCSD 
women placed four athletes in the top 25 to win a second consecutive national champion-ship. The Tritons were led by graduate student Darlene Hunt, who placed fourth with a time of 02:20:49.00, and senior Lauren Chiodini, who had the fastest split on the race’s bike section. The men’s team placed seventh overall, led by graduate student Tim Ray’s 22nd place finish. 
At nationals, UCSD scored 191 points, fin-
ishing fifth in the country out of 95 teams that com-peted. 
During the Tritons’ short 
history, they have raised the competition, battling with the nation’s best squads every year. UCSD athletes have also accomplished great feats individually, with top charges qualifying for the prestigious Ironman World Championship in Hawaii. The Ironman is the 
triathlon to the extreme — athletes complete a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and run a mara-thon. The race can take up to 24 hours.  
Of course, results never come without hard 
work and practice, and triathletes do plenty of both. Despite being a club sport, the team trains and competes as much as any of UCSD’s sports teams. 
“The top tier of athletes who compete for us 
are working out at least once a day, sometimes 
twice a day, ” Uyeda said. 
Brown, a local pro triathlete, was the sixth-
fastest American at Ironman Hawaii in 2007. 
This is his first year as head coach of the team; assistant coach Marcus Catano leads strength training for the athletes. 
“Our coach does everything he can to 
train us for our individual goals, ” Kotturi said. “He reminds us to train smarter, not harder, in that more workouts are not always the best 
thing. ”
The team meets for official practice Sunday 
through Thursday; the location varies accord-
ing to the activity. On Saturdays, the squad 
´We all really love tri 
and we want as many 
people as possible to 
share in that. ”

Following a walk-off victory over 
Sonoma State University in the con-ference championships last week, the 
Tritons look to carry momentum into the NCAA West Regional this weekend.
After claiming its second California 
Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament title, UCSD rose to No. 2 in the Division II national rankings and earned the No. 1 seed for regionals. Today, the Tritons (36-12) will go up against fourth-seeded Cal State Dominguez Hills (34-21) in Keizer, Ore. 
“We can expect [Cal State Dominguez 
Hills] to come out ready to play, ” junior short-stop Vance Albitz said. “They’ve seen us, and we’ve seen them. It’s going to be a great battle. ”
The Tritons and Toros have become famil-
iar foes after facing off several times in the past month, most recently in the CCAA Tournament. In mid-April, the teams split a four-game set before the first round of postseason play. UCSD held CSUDH to a single run, winning 2-1 to start the Tritons’ championship drive.
UCSD is looking to end the offen-
sive struggles suffered during its past few Thursday games.
“Offensively, we’re going to focus on our 
approach and stick with it, ” Albitz said. “If we can do that, we’ll be successful this weekend. ”
This year’s West Regional consists 
of CCAA rivals Sonoma State (32-14) and CSUDH, as well as Western Oregon University (33-12).
UCSD faced Sonoma State twice last 
weekend, crushing the Seawolves 16-1 in the first game and coming back to win an 8-7 thriller in the championship. The two teams split six matchups this season, but UCSD won the last three.
The Tritons played Western Oregon in 
February, dropping three out of four games.
