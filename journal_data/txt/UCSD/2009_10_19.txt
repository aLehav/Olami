Open since Fall Quarter 2008, the Loft — Price 
Center’s music, culture and art space — is still without a permanent source of fund-
ing. Administrators are hoping that a new University Centers programming fee will provide the venue with the revenue necessary to continuing operation.
The referendum, which would redefine the 
University Centers charter to allow use of the depart-ment’s funding for events programming, is currently 
being considered by the University Events Advisory Board and will be discussed by the A.S. Council. 
If approved by the council, the stu-
dent body would vote for or against funding the Loft in a referendum later this year.
University Events Office Director 
Marty Wollesen and university spokes-man Paul Terzino said that without a permanent funding source, the Loft may 
have to lay off student employees, host fewer events and begin charging students for concerts at the door.
A.S. President Utsav Gupta said that under the 
proposed programming fee initiative, University Centers would continue to be in charge of the Loft. Gupta said the proposal is still in its early stages of discussion, and he has not yet formed a stance on the initiative.
Currently, the Loft is running on funds from mul-
tiple sources, including the University Events Office, Venue administrators hope to 
raise student fees in an effort to attain stable funding source.4WN\:M^Q^M[

Participants in Ellen DeGeneres’ 
Twitter Challenge looted Price 
Center on Oct. 15 for a chance to win tickets to DeGeneres’ “12 Days of Giveaways” show.
The challenge, which was a sca-

Another former employ-
ee of the UCSD Parking and 
Transportation department has claimed that UCSD utilizes an illegal quota system by requir-ing officers to issue a minimum amount of parking tickets per day. 
Carole Rains, former assis-
tant director of Medical Transportation and Parking at the UCSD Medical Center in Hillcrest, said that in July 2006 she was instructed by Director of Parking and Transportation Brian D’ Autremont to double and triple the number of cita-tions her staff of three officers were giving out.
She said the department 
would print out sheets compar-ing the number of tickets each officer had given out and dis-tribute the comparisons to the officers pressuring them to issue more citations.
D’ Autremont admitted to 
posting these numbers, but denied setting a quota.
“It’s a real simple equation, ” 
he said. “Y ou go out and write 
citations for what’s illegal ... I 
don’t even want to get involved in it. I check in once every month. ”
Raines said that the system 
encouraged officers to write fab-ricated tickets.
“It depends on a myriad of factors that change every day, ” she said. “It’s impossible to set an arbitrary number. At least one officer was saying ‘I’m going to write however many tickets they tell me to write — I don’t care if they’re good or bad. ’ Once the officer gives the ticket, he’s done. He doesn’t have to deal with appeals. It’s a major ethics issue. ” 
Raines, who worked for the 
department for 28 years and consistently received outstand-ing evaluations, left her posi-

This caused students to steal from 
several Price Center restaurants.
The challenge was announced at 
8:33 a.m. on Oct. 15 with a Tweet from DeGeneres that read: “If you know what UCSD stands for, then you should probably be looking out for my tweets… ”
The challenge officially began 
when Degeneres tweeted that the first person to bring any type of corn product to Aaron Pinkston, DeGeneres’s field producer, would be in the running to win a prize.
“There was a giant crowd out-
side at [Price Center], ” ERC College sophomore Gilbert Tercerro said. “Then someone said something on stage, and then people just started rushing inside and going every-where. It was crazy. ”
Some participants resorted 
to stealing corn products such as Pirate’s Booty from Price Center locations, including Jamba Juice and the Sunshine Market.
“People were running in and 
stealing things on, apparently, a scavenger hunt for this show, and running out without paying, ” UCSD Police Officer G. Williams said. “On top of that there are people stripping down to their underwear in the food court where people are eating. OK? We’re at a point where this is beyond acceptable and it is disrupting the university. ”
The looting also 
caused other discour-aged students to leave the event.
“When people start-
ed stealing, I just left, because you can’t com-pete with that — and I just thought it was lame, ” Revelle College sopho-more Amber Frauhiger said.
The winners of the 
corn challenge were brought to the second floor of Price Center, where they were instructed to take a picture of themselves wearing only a red towel and posing with someone in a uniform — all in under 15 minutes.
“ As the second round began, 
we bolted away, and I overheard 
someone say that UCSD catering had red towels, ” Warren College senior Michael Kirkpatrick, a winner from the event, said. “I ran to catering and found a very nice man-ager who directed me to a red tablecloth. I was then able to take a photo with someone from Jamba Juice to qualify as a person in uniform. ”
Students who 
expected DeGeneres at the event were disap-pointed.
“I went to the event 
because I wanted to see Ellen DeGeneres, ” 
Frauhiger said. “I’m not going to lie. She’s hilarious. At that point [when I found out Ellen wasn’t going to be 
there], I didn’t really care anymore. I was like ‘If she’s not here I don’t want to be here. ’”
Other contestants enjoyed play-
ing the game despite DeGeneres’ absence.
“For me it was a very exciting 
event, ” Kirkpatrick said. “It was a blast running around Price Center and seeing the enthusiasm of the other students. I spoke to Ellen’s film crew and had the advantage of knowing that she was not attend-ing. But not knowing wouldn’t have changed my decision to attend the event. ”
Five finalists, including 
Kirkpatrick, were awarded with tick-ets to Degeneres’ show and a trip to Los Angeles.
“It was incredible to see the 
amount of people in Price Center with their enthusiasm, ” Kirkpatrick said. 
The competition is slated to air 
Monday at 3 p.m on KNSD.

It’s official — UCSD is one of the 
country’s 26 greenest universities. 
The College Sustainability 
Report Card, an organization that rates college sustainability levels annually, recently gave UCSD an ‘ A-’ — the highest grade awarded in the nation — on its Oct. 8 “Green Report Card. ”
Of the five UC campuses sur-
veyed — UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UCLA, UC Merced and UCSD — UCSD received the highest overall grade.
The goal of the Green Report 
Card project is to showcase uni-versities that excel in sustainability, according to the organization’s Web site, www.greenreportcard.org. 
The site ranked each school in nine 
categories — such as transportation and recycling — with a letter grade, adding up to an overall averaged score. 
This is the second year UCSD 
has been evaluated by Green Report Card. Last year, the campus received a ‘B+. ’ UCSD bumped its score up to an ‘ A-’ by raising its Food and Recycling sub-grade from a ‘B’ to an ‘ A. ’
The dining hall's use of fair trade 
products — items purchased at a price fair to exporters in developing countries — and organic foods  fac-
tored into the grade increase. UCSD 
Housing and Hospitality purchases fair trade coffee, chocolate, sugar and tea.
“We have been planning with 
the administration to get our uni-versity to be the second college in the nation to receive fair trade certification, ” Sixth College senior Fran Avendano said. 
Avendano is a co-
founder of the Student Sustainabilty Collective.
UCSD will open a 
Sustainability Resource Center next month, funded by $150,000 in student fees allocated by  an Associated Students referendum that passed last year. 
“We're a coalition of 
student groups on cam-pus working on these issues such as compost, transportation and fair trade, ” Avendano said. “It's a new trend of sus-tainability on campus. Before our efforts were very disunified, but now our efforts are centralizing and we have this center that will really accelerate sus-tainability efforts from now on. ”
Other areas in which the campus 
excelled included Climate Change and Energy, Administration and Transportation. 
UCSD is striving to achieve a zero 
carbon footprint by 2020 by focus-ing on projects aimed at reducing energy consumption and increas-ing energy efficiency. UCSD also utilizes hybrid vehicles throughout campus and encourages carpooling.
Categories where the cam-
pus scored lower include Green Building, Endowment Transparency and Investment Priorities, which 
received a ‘B, ’ ‘B’ and ‘C, ’ respectively.
While UCSD does 
employ certain green practices in its buildings — such as utilizing low-flow sinks, toilets and showerheads throughout the campus — it only has two buildings that hold up to the standards of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, an organization established by the U.S. Green Building Council to set standards for green buildings.
“I certainly think 
that for us to truly work towards reversing and finding solutions to cli-mate change we need to work on everything, ” 
Campus Sustainability Coordinator Maggie Souder said. “That being said, I think we're definitely doing better with green buildings now and I think we're going to keep improv-ing. The university is working on becoming more transparent with the investments as well. ”
Readers can contact Ayelet Bitton at 
arbitton@ucsd.edu.Fair trade and organic 
produce help raise UCSD’s sustainability rating from ‘B+’ to ‘ A-. ’

tion in 2006 due to health issues. She said 
the department began putting increased pressure on officers to give out more citations after D’ Autremont became director in 2006. 
An e-mail that D’ Autremont 
sent to Raines on Dec. 16, 2005 suggested that a particular offi-cer was not giving out enough tickets and stated the average number of tickets given out by an officer per day. The e-mail instructed Raines to never call the system a quota. 
“There were snarky com-
ments that put subtle, yet overt, pressure on these people, ” Raines said. “Things like ‘Y our numbers are looking low’ or ‘Y ou better watch out… ’ . These guys have families to support. They will do anything to please the boss, to keep their jobs. ”
Raine’s claims follow similar allegations made earlier this month by former parking enforcement officer Kenneth Brennan.
Brennan said he was asked 
by his supervisor, Marty Greenawalt, to raise the num-ber of tickets he was giving out under an unofficial quota system. 
He said that parking 
enforcement officers were forced to give out citations for parking infractions that they would usually only issue warn-ings for. 
Both Raines and Brennan 
said that current employees are too afraid of losing their jobs to confirm or deny these allegations.
Three UCSD parking enforce-
ment officers contacted for this story refused to comment.

Part One:  If God does not exist, you should not believe in Him.  
But if He does, you would be foolish not to, because you would 
not be living your life with a frame of reference that corresponds to 
Reality.  There is certainly a battle, rather, a full-scale war, against 
God, particularly in secular universities, but also in the media and 
entertainment industries, books, music, and in the courthouses across America.  
The bottom line issue in America’s Cultural War is not about politics or economics or moral preferences – these are just symptomatic battlefields of the real war which is this:  Shall We Believe in God?
Underlying the natural, social, and political sciences being taught in our public 
secondary schools and universities today is the unproven assumption that there is no God.  The scientific methodology examines the natural world to discover and cooperate with its laws, hopefully for the improvement of life on the earth.  There is nothing inherent in the methods of science that requires an antitheist (against God) philosophical bias.  Both theists (those who believe in God) and antitheists can and do use the same methodology.  The theist sees the hand of God in creating and sustaining the universe, the antitheist does not.  Fine.  But what is not fine is the biased philosophy of naturalism that presupposes without evidence that there is no God.  The evidence for Intelligent Design, and thus an Intelligent Designer, is overwhelming, far more convincing that the antitheist Darwinian philosophy taught as fact in our university classrooms.  And yet, will the Theory of Intelligent Design get a fair hearing?
Likewise, there is nothing inherent in the methodologies of anthropology that 
should require one to be antitheist.  One can be committed to objectivity as one studies the worldviews, values, mores, and religions of various cultures, whether the researchers believe in God or not.  Yet many absolutize the methodology and become cultural relativists, and therefore antitheists.  The bias against God is enormous.  Antitheism is one of the most central facets of political correctness, and woe to the ambitious professor or student that does not bow the knee and pay homage.
What is behind this aggressive antitheism?  Why such a war against God?  
Antitheist bias is certainly not required by the evidence.   So what gives?  Perhaps the antitheist writer Aldous Huxley (1894-1963), author of Brave New World, has the best answer.  In his book Ends and Means, he writes:
“I had motives for not wanting the world to have a meaning; consequently I 
assumed that it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption.  Most ignorance is vincible ignorance.  We don’t know because we don’t want to know.  It is our will that decides how and upon what subjects we shall use our intelligence.  Those who detect no meaning in the world generally do so because for one reason or another, it suits their books that the world should be meaningless. ” (p. 270, italics mine).
Later in the same book Huxley is more specific in revealing the reasons behind 
his antitheist and amoral bias.
“For myself, as, no doubt, for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of 
meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liber ation.  The liberation we 
desired was simultaneously liberation from a certain political and economic system and liberation from a certain system of morality.  We objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom; we objected to the political and economic system because it was unjust”  (p.223, italics mine).
Huxley’s admission should be embarrassing to those academicians and 
students today who find themselves opting for antitheist and amoral philosophies, not because the evidence calls for it, but because of their own sexual and political biases.  So much for intellectual and moral integrity.

the Student Affairs Cluster and the Registration 
Fee Committee. Although these departments have been supportive so far, they won’t be able to fund the venue permanently, according to Wollesen.
The Registration Fee Committee has pro-
vided enough funding to support two staff positions and to purchase lighting and audio equipment. However, these funds are not enough to pay for the Loft’s events. 
Additionally, Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue granted the Loft one-time funding that will last for three quarters, but can’t provide on-going support. 
Receiving funding from student fees would 
be the most reliable ongoing source of support for the Loft, said Wollesen.
“ A proposal to establish a modest student 
fee would be the most reliable source of the needed [funds] to bring quality performers to the Loft several nights a week with no admis-sion charge to students, ” Wollesen said. 
Ideally, Wollesen would like to see Loft 
events sponsored by a combination of funds from University Centers — totalling $30,000 a year — and student fees. Additional funds would be derived from a restaurant that Wollesen plans to open at the venue. 
Last year, the Loft’s financial troubles led 
Wollesen to ask the A.S. Council to put a $2.62-per-quarter Loft fee referendum on the spring ballot for students to vote on. However, due to concerns about student oversight, the council refused to put the issue before the student body.
The fee referendum that is currently under consideration is similar, except the money would go directly to the Loft instead of being channeled through the A.S. Council. 
Former A.S. President Donna Bean had 
described the Loft’s business methods as “fis-cally irresponsible. ” When asked about Bean’s comment, Gupta said her concern could have stemmed from the fact that the Loft’s numer-ous funding sources make it unclear as to what higher body the Loft should report. 
However, Wollensen sees benefits in the 
Loft’s business model, describing it as “… very sound [because it] … relies not just on one source of support, but multiple sources. ” 
Though the Loft could technically run an 
independent referendum, it is unlikely that it would pass, Gupta said. 
Traditionally, most student fee referenda 
are introduced through the A.S. Council.  According to Gupta, if a proposal has to go through the administration, there are more points at which it could fail because of all the different levels of bureaucracy. Students are more likely to vote on referenda supported by the A.S. council, Gupta said. 
However, in the most recent report from 
the Registration Fee Advisory Committee, the committee listed the Loft as one of the highest funding priorities. 
According to the report, which offers fund-
ing recommendations for the 2009-2010 fiscal year, an item of “highest priority” means that it “ … should be insulated from any budget reductions. ”

Usually, when midterm week 
hits, I’m one of the many Perks lurkers burrowed 
into a chair with a hot cup of cof-fee, earphones and a pile of books. Occasionally, I even find myself a part of the unshaven chain-smoker contin-gent lining Geisel’s walkway.
But this year seems to be my year 
of change. I finally quit smoking ,and I’ve even made an effort to eat right (for the most part).
Good food is, after all, fundamen-
tal to good mental health — but when midterms roll around, it’s also impor-tant to indulge a little.
So, with that in mind, I decided 
to skip the late-night BK run and try my hand at baking: one dish to sustain me for a few meals during the week, and another for a sweet post-cram reward. The objective: a baked pasta casserole and a batch of red-velvet cupcakes. Estimated cook-ing time: about an hour total, each dish requiring 15 to 20 minutes of preparation.
Baked casserole seemed easy 
enough, considering I was already a seasoned veteran in the art of water-boiling. First, I added a pinch of salt and threw some whole-wheat pasta shells in the pan (one hopes, by his second year of off-campus living, he knows how to make pasta). Beyond that, all I had to do was chop up a yel-low onion, two garlic cloves and four cups of spinach, zest two lemons and saute everything together in olive oil. 
With an irrational  sense of control 
over the kitchen, I reached for my sauteed onions — and was painfully humbled by a burn to the forearm as I absentmindedly brushed against the cooking pot. In retrospect, the pain was negligible and short-lived, but it was more a blow to my confidence, as I’ d somehow managed to sustain an injury before zesting my first lemon. 
Fortunately, it 
was my only culi-nary injury of the day. From there, I mixed my sauteed produce with the pasta, added the lemon zest (finally), sliced almonds for 
extra zing and crunch, and slowly poured the mixture into a baking pan — afterward adding a layer of moz-zarella on top. 
Once I had sat through 30 minutes 
of baking time at 375 degrees, part one of my baking mission was complete.
In all honesty, the crunchy fruits 
of my labor weren’t so great at first — though adding alfredo sauce and 
bacon the next day made the casserole 
infinitely tastier.  
I can confidently say, however, 
that part two of my mission — baking the red-velvet cupcakes — was one of the most rewarding endeavors I have taken on in my short life. It’s entirely possible that the fulfillment I got out of baking these cupcakes will blos-som into a full-fledged love affair with 
homemade deserts. It was so easy, and 
so worth it.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —  The UC Board of Regents 
recently proposed a fee hike separate from the 32-percent one that 
everyone’s so up in arms over — and this time, they’re not reaching into everyone’s pockets at once.
A $900 tuition hike for upper-division engineering and business 
students is being discussed as yet another way to close the budget shortfall. Though the proposal was shelved for further study last week, university officials said the plan could still very likely resur-face. And with student fees already set to rise an appalling $2,514 next year, the additional increases would amount to more than the average student can bear. 
Tying tuition rates to majors is a novel concept for us UC kids, 
but about half of all public universities across the country charge more for certain academic programs.  In 2007, for instance, the

The University of California is in its deepest crisis in half a century and every mem-
ber of the UC community feels the blow.Y ou, the students, are espe-cially affected, as you will see your tuition rise, your classes grow, wait lists expand, courses disappear, the 
quality of your education suffer and 
the prestige of your UC diploma slip. 
But everyone is affected, from 
staff and faculty to the administra-tion. We are in this together. 
What went wrong? Is it that the 
UC system failed and now needs shock therapy to mend its ways? Hardly. The UC system is not per-
fect, but it has been a spectacular 
success — an engine of economic growth and social equality. The UC system is considered among the best universities in the world and just this year, two of its current fac-ulty and three of its alumni received Nobel Prizes. 
Is it that the UC system is like 
a carriage-maker whose product is excellent, but in low demand because barely anyone travels by horse and buggy? President Yudof suggested as much in a recent inter-view, arguing that as our country grows older there is less demand for higher education. This may be true elsewhere, but not in California. Our state is not expecting a signifi-cant drop in college-age students anytime soon. 
Moreover, in 
California only one in four young people go to four-year colleges and universities compared 
to one in two Indiana or 
Massachusetts. In fact, only two states do more poorly than us. 
So why is the legislature tak-
ing away money from something that works and is in high demand? Where has our money gone? One part of it has gone to healthcare where costs are running amok. If 
you want to save the UC system, fight for healthcare reform. Another 
part of our money has gone to the prison system. In 1977 there were 20,000 prisoners in California. Today, thanks to the war on drugs, mandatory sentencing and three-strikes laws, that number has sky-rocketed to 173,000. Even though prison conditions are appalling, the state spends five times more on an inmate than it does on your 
education, and the aver-age prison guard in California makes twice as much as a guard in Texas.
What can be done? 
There are three options. 
The first is priva-
tization. That would 
shift most of the cost 
of higher education to you, the students. In a fully privatized model, tuition would have to rise to $27,000 to return UC funding to normal levels. We can reduce this enormous increase by drawing on other private 
revenue sources, but each has its price and they would not bring in enough money to spare you from a still-large fee increase. 
The second option is a 30-per-
cent cut in enrollment. The cut would make up for how much less money the UC system is currently getting from Sacramento. 
This would be a disaster. 
California’s already abysmal college-going rate would fall even further, depriving 15,000 students each year of a UC education. Either solution will have a devastating effect on access and diversity. If we do noth-ing, some combination of these two options is going to happen. 
The third solution is to fight 
for maintaining the UC system as a public institution (how it was envisioned by the California Master Plan, which is still the law of our state). This fight cannot be fought for the UC system only, otherwise any extra dollar for the UC system will have to be taken from else-where. Taking from other vulnera-ble institutions would pit us against the California State University sys-
tem, K-12 education, healthcare for 
poor children and other constituen-cies, each with its own legitimate set of needs. We would be divided and conquered. 
The only hope of success is to 
fight for sweeping political change. Think big, act politically. There has to be a healthcare reform and a complete overhaul of the criminal 
justice system. Most importantly,

▶ RONA-TAS, MYVTWHNLTHE NEW ROBOT By Alec Zachreson
Dear Editor,
I want to commend you on the 
thoughtful summary your editorial 
board made in regard to the meeting with UC President Yudof and the cur-rent economic crisis of the UC system. With the misinformation and political gesturing surrounding the California budget and public universities, it is important for students to understand the rock-and-a-hard-place spot that we are all in right now.
UCSD is at a tipping point in its 
history as one of the finest research institutions in the country and, argu-ably, the world. How do we maintain the highest quality of education without the budget to back it? In the past, when money and resources were available, we were able to attract top faculty, staff and administration to the campus. The resulting excellence of information coming from UCSD does more than collect accolades; it actually increases the value of your degree. 
Each student who comes to 
UCSD chooses to come here in order to best set themselves up for their future. They want to graduate with this university’s name on their degree and resume because they believe the opportunities here will translate to a high paycheck down the road. It’s a simple business return: The greater the reputation of your university, the greater the return you will get on your investment in your education.
For whatever misconceptions are 
out there about how much money UC campuses do or don’t have, or how it is or isn’t spent, the reality is this: The amount of money you pay for your education barely dents the amount of what it costs to bring you to this campus, in a building, with a desk and a teacher before you. The state of California pitches in some money (but 50 percent less than it did 20 years ago), and the rest has to come from creative funding. How? The Student Foundation has your answer: Day Tuition Ends will be featured on Library Walk during the Chancellor’s 5K Challenge on Oct. 23, and will tell you exactly how far your dollar is stretched in your education. Trust me, it’s not as far as you think.
With the proposed fee increases, 
you are being asked to invest more in your education than ever before. Maintain the value of your investment by taking the Chancellor’s Challenge and becoming an I-Pledge donor to give directly to student scholar-ships. Or put your mouth where your money is and let California know exactly how you have been impacted by budget cuts with three simple clicks at advocacy.ucsd.edu . 
As an alumnus and UCSD staff 
member, I sympathize with students facing financial hardship from the proposed fee increases. Due to budget cuts, I’ve seen top-of-the-field faculty recruitments pulled off the table, my pay decrease by nearly 18 percent and colleagues laid off. But I believe access to higher education is the future for a successful California, and I will keep pushing until every student who wants to be here gets the resources they need to succeed. Come join the fight.

Book your trip for Spring Break!Loans, Credit Scores, Stocks & more!Business CenterThe recipe — a brainchild of the 
Food Network’s Paula Deen — was 
incredibly simple, and my aunt’s handy electronic beater helped get the job done quick. 
By mixing a few cups of vegetable 
oil, buttermilk, all-purpose flower and sugar with two eggs — along with a few teaspoons of cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, vinegar, red food color-ing and vanilla extract — I created a doughy cupcake foundation, then poured the mixture into individual cupcake racks and placed them in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.
I’ll admit it: Making the cream-
cheese frosting should have made me feel like a terrible person. There has to be something wrong with mixing one pound of cream cheese with four cups of sugar and two sticks of butter — but any hint of moral guilt was lost on me as I burrowed into the happy place of my inner child and licked the frosting off of each individual beater.
After the cupcakes had risen per-
fectly in their slots, I slabbed on the frosting and garnished them with red sprinkles for some extra presenta-tion points. Considering the univer-sally heart-warming aroma of freshly baked cake that was wafting through-out my townhouse, I wasted no more time in guiltlessly indulging in a warm, fresh cupcake. Inner child was in full force by the time I’ d stuffed the rest into my mouth. No more Geisel smoking breaks for me — I could get used to this whole baking gig.

began charging an extra $500 for undergraduates pursuing a degree in business administration. Likewise, students in engineering and nursing at Arizona State University pay $300 and $750 more, respectively, per semester. 
Supporters of differential tuition 
costs love to tout the higher median salaries of professors in certain fields. Last year’s National Faculty Survey found that professors in engineering and business management earn, on average, $112,347 and $108,230 a year, respectively. By contrast, the average English literature professor rakes in a comparatively paltry $79,854.
The rationale is simple: Higher 
operating costs demand that students pay a higher price.  
Those supporting the fee increase 
also claim that its increased annual revenue — projected to be around $10 million, after factoring in $5 million for financial aid — would help retain top-notch faculty and preserve the high standards for which these pro-grams are known.
But against the backdrop of 
unprecedented lows in state fund-ing and steep student fees, selective tuition increases would do more harm than good. With each passing fee hike, a UC education limits its appeal to prospective students. While the uni-versity may need to cut enrollment, admits shouldn’t be tempted to trash admission letters on their own.
Paying an additional $900 a year 
to major in engineering or business (or, on our campus, only the former, as we lack a business program) could even prevent some students interested in these fields from pursuing them, despite the renown and prestige of specialized programs in these disci-plines offered at UC campuses. 
It’s true that a degree in mechani-
cal engineering is more advantageous in today’s job market than one in, say, history. But the proposal bypasses other majors that will arguably turn out equally successful graduates. For instance, a degree in the biological and physical sciences — both fields that attract a high volume of students and require a hefty investment of resources to support their curricula — is just as likely to get a student a well-paying job as an engineering or business degree.
The regents’ singling out of engi-
neering and business majors based on generalized assumptions of their potential for post-graduate success is shortsighted, especially given the cur-rent recession. 
Should this proposal eventually 
pass, it would also likely cause resent-ment not only among those students who will be forced to pay more, but those who won’t, too. Because in pass-ing the proposal, the regents would 
essentially be placing a greater value upon engineering and business pro-grams than the rest. 
Engineering programs are espe-
cially notorious for the endless list of courses they require students to take before graduation. Because of larger class sizes and fewer course offerings, students are often hard-pressed to complete their degrees within four years, and many stay even longer. With these new fee increases in place, engineering students — who represent about 14 percent of UCSD’s student body — will have a much more expensive way out of college than the rest of us, especially given the com-mon necessity of a fifth year. 
Perhaps an additional $900 won’t 
bring tuition to private-school lev-els, but it will nevertheless decrease access to the university. Engineering students can’t just tap into the full bank accounts they’re expected to hold in the distant future; they, like their Chaucer-studying peers, are still struggling students when the tuition bills are due. 
So while it may seem an easy step 
out of the deficit, banking on a select group of students to pay more than the rest isn’t the answer — especially given the fact that, in this economy, success isn’t guaranteed for anyone anymore.

VONS, PACIFIC BEACH
Traversing the cliffs and 
craters of Iceland — tiny nation, monster volcanic hotspot — has long been compared to stepping foot on another planet.
Or at least the moon: In 1965 and 
1967, a group of 25 American astronauts semi-secretly rehearsed what would be the first lunar landing in the Icelandic outback.
Indeed, Greenland’s slightly balmier 
neighbor is out of this world. Iceland is essentially a floating slab of volcanic rock — dark, jagged, rolling rock — pushed up from the bottom of the ocean, stud-ded by geysers, gurgling mud pots and sky-blue pockets of steaming water. In its capitol of Reykjavik, which contains two-thirds of the country’s population — a mere 200,000 people — the stench of sulfur tumbles from every faucet, and underground pipes of hot-spring water run beneath each doorstep to melt the snow that falls there. In summer, the sun sets for barely four hours; in winter, the sky sleeps in an almost eternal night.
But Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography geochemist David Hilton finds Iceland to be anything but other-worldly. According to Hilton, the island is formed by an up-rush of underwater lava — what he calls a “geothermic plume, ” shot from the Earth’s deep man-tle layer — making it the closest thing we have to a piece of primordial Earth.
Ever since he based his doctoral thesis 
on Icelandic findings in the early ’80s, Hilton has returned over a dozen times to the remote island to collect additional samples of its ancient gasses. Still, he said, the Icelandic landscape never fails to amaze him.
“It’s rugged; it’s mountainous; you 
have these fantastic glaciers, ” he said. “Y ou have deserts — vast plains where there’s very little vegetation, just rocks. Y ou have other parts of Iceland where there’s massive rivers coming from the glaciers; so it’s varied, it’s rugged. ”
Hilton and a team of graduate stu-
dents — including Scripps superstars Evelyn Füri and Peter Barry — made their three most recent trips to Iceland in 2006, 2007 and 2008, running on two $200,000 grants from the National Science Foundation. Despite the eco-nomic downturn, Hilton said he’s actu-ally seen a boost in funding for research projects like his own.
“When Obama came in, he had the 
stimulus package, so actually a lot more money went into the National Science Foundation, ” Hilton said. “So, [the eco-nomic crisis] has had the opposite effect there actually … There’s more funds out there to go and get, to do science. ”
With the help of local land experts, 
the team collected as much as 200 pounds in samples per trip. They extracted water from fumaroles — gassy holes in the Earth’s surface — and hammered off pieces of rock and glass from the island’s crust, which would

BOOKREVIEW
MANTLE PIECE
of the BY SIMONE WILSON  SENIOR STAFF WRITEREileen Myles, Ne w  Yor k  
grunge poet (for lack of better label/in defiance of applying “lesbi-an” or “punk”) and head of the UCSD writing department up until two tragic years past, has a new geographical obsession. And though her obsessive tendencies are volcano-years from the nitrogen extraction lines of Scripps noble-gas wizard David Hilton, the two professors share a perplexed awe for the semi-depressing mid-Atlantic lava lump that is everyone’s favorite Iceland.
Obsessed as she was, or may still 
be, it seems Myles couldn’t, in the end, stretch her stream of conscious-ness on Iceland any longer than 38 pages, including back-translated Icelandic poem and black-and-white waterfall print. (Must be hard out there for a barebones poet who’s used to maxing pages at 20 words and a sea of thinky white space.) But she was right in thinking her excellent title and its accompanying glacier graphic, and all the Iceland that fills our heads between the two, would serve as a hell of a rock for the stack of leafy art writings that follow. 
Though it may be illusion, all her 
unrelated ramblings do seem to tie back to Iceland. Every long-ish word seems to spell Iceland backward and all cliquey name-drops seem only a few degrees from an unknown ancestor — and wait is Walden Pond in Iceland? — who makes his or her home on a crusty chip of geothermal plumage, way out you-know-where.
What with all the Bjork/Sigur 
Ros/sheepherder hype, Iceland is bordering on too trendy for Myles, a swaggering lesbian (shit, I said it) who’s always been two steps ahead of cool, but never too Cool for Y ou. She loudly (smartly) acknowledges this obviousness early on. Even gets a little possessive, as artists do when something they love is popular for the wrong reasons. Like, come on, everyone just knows it in terms of not being Greenland. Or goes there on a cheap pit stop to greater Europe.
Myles even goes so far as to sneak 
a latter-page vignette on the nauseat-ingly hip yet actually awesome Bjork — “baby tyrant, very formal” — and her following of actually hip hipsters — “full of very good clothes” — and it’s a good and loving feeling, she keeps telling us, but we’re just not part of it. We just keep squeezing Iceland to death with our love, but it’s only ever going to belong to those who made their home on the rock, who lost their sheep to the lava, who drank themselves silly through days which are nights. For us, it’s just a place to be lonely. And a poet does love to be lonely.
THE IMPORTANCE
OF BEING ICELAND 
EILEEN MYLES
BRIDGE BETWEEN TWO CONTINENTSA Formed from a plume of volcanic activity,
ICELAND  offers Scripps researchers a
chance to get their hands on
FOUR THINGS  YOU NEVER KNEW YOU DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT ICELAND
See ICELAND, page 10There were no roads — we had to take a 
boat to get to the bay where we started 
hiking. And then here was this huge river, and we 
had to cross this river to get to all the hot springs and fumaroles on the other side. So we all took our socks and shoes off, and our trousers off, so we were just in our underpants — in the middle of nowhere, so nobody sees you, you know? And then we walked 
across this river. It was the most painful experience of 
my life. This water was incredibly cold. It was coming 
straight off a glacier, you know? And then your legs go numb, and you have 
pins and needles, and you’re walking like you’re on stilts. And you think, ‘Oh my god, if I fall over now’ — because the water was up to there — ‘I’m gonna die.’ And then you get to the other side, and oh, you’re in agony.
“But then you get to the hot springs, and all the steam is there, so you warm 
up, quickly, you know? And then you’re OK, and you can collect a sample.
“But then you have to get back to the other side. I remember there was an 
old guy, a farmer, an Icelandic guy, and he saw the distress I was in. And on the 
way back, he was looking at me, and I was looking at him, and I was looking for somewhere very easy to cross. And then he turned around, and he went like this — [pats back] — and immediately, I was on his back, and he gave me a piggyback across the river, thank god for that! I later found out how old he was: He was 79, and at the time I was 29, so he was 50 years older than me, and he carried me across the river. It was incredible.”
On one of his first trips to Iceland, while trekking to a remote glacier,
Hilton said he faced one of the biggest physical challenges of his life.
More than active volcanoes or scalding hot springs, Hilton said he isapprehensive of transport to foreign sampling sites.
Probably the worst thing [about field research] is the traffic. You’re in a 
new country — like in Turkey, for example, or in Indonesia, in particular 
— and you’re driving around the whole country, usually with a local driver. The only time I’m really scared is like — the traffic. Some of these guys are crazy drivers, you know? And I’m like, oh my god, I’m going to die! So it’s actually nice to get to the volcano. You feel safe. You got a little bit of control there.”Hilton is currently teaching the geographic portion of uber-popular un-
dergraduate course SIO 30  — or “The Oceans” — for non-science majors. He said the class emphasizes what we can learn from studying the Earth’s oceans, such as trends in climate change.
One of the big current debates is obviously CO2 in the atmosphere,” 
Hilton said. “CO2 is an acid gas, so what it means is, the pH [level] of the 
oceans will start to go down the more CO2 you have in the atmosphere. And that has major implications for what can live in the oceans, and what can grow in the oceans … Living here in San Diego, maybe that’s important.”PHOTOS  COURTESY  OF DAVID  HILTON
For eight months, beginning in 1783, an eruption of the Laki fissure in southern Iceland killed 50 percent of the 
country’s livestock population. A subsequent 25 percent of the Icelandic human population died in the resulting 
famine. Additionally, the deadly haze of sulfur dioxide released in the eruption killed 
thousands throughout Europe and threw off the entire planet’s weather patterns.
Icelandic is so closely related to the medieval language of Old Norse that Icelandic 
children can most often read ancient Scandinavian documents. Don’t feel small yet? 
The Icelandic university system is free of cost for students, and the nation boasts a 
100-percent literacy rate.
The Icelandic word for computer is tölva, which comes from völva, or oracle — essentially named on the notion that 
computers can see the future. (Hey, there aren’t many Old Nordic options for scary-smart box of beeps and wires.) 
You can buy Icelandic lamb in Whole Foods, and — according to UCSD graduate student Berglind Maria Tómasdót-
tir — it’s much fresher and more “wild-tasting” than the New Zealand alternative.

BY ANGELA CHEN  STAFF WRITER
ERIK JEPSEN /GUARDIANRunning away with the circus 
is a glamorous childhood dream — one that most of us 
abandoned once we found out about all the manure duty and realized clowns were, um, scary. But here to rekindle our earliest ambitions is Muir College sophomore Elizabeth 
Sibert : circus aerialist extraordi-
naire. 
You may have noticed her jug-
gling clubs on Sun God lawn. Or maybe you’ve seen her atop that unicycle, breezing past a sluggish student body on her way to classes. Either way, make sure to step aside.
“It makes for a lot of funny looks, 
and then people become roadblocks because they’re staring, ” said Sibert.
There aren’t many places to walk 
a tightrope on campus, but accord-ing to Sibert, she can do that too. And rumor has it the girl swings a mean trapeze.
Her obsession began in 5th grade 
during a Club Med family reunion to Mexico. Sibert said, the kids were shipped off to circus lessons to occupy their time. And it’s been occupying her time for a while now.
“I tried the flying trapeze there 
and loved it, ” Sibert said. “I fell in love with the circus, and was doing all these crazy stunts that gave my mother heart failure. ” 
The very next spring, she joined 
a circus camp to reconnect with her newfound affinity for acrobat-ics — and has been an aerial stunt girl ever since. What’s more, for the past three summers, Sibert worked at Tito Gaona’s Flying Trapeze Academy and Flying Fantasy Circus, in Massachusetts, inspiring would-be aerialists as young as six years old to do as she did.
Sibert said she specializes in 
eliciting shock and glee from her audiences. As an aerial specialist, she performs everything from flying trapeze to the aerial hoop — cart-wheeling at upward of 20 to 25 feet off the ground.
“The circus is about crazy tricks 
and looking for ways to make the audience gasp, then laugh, ” Sibert said. “It’s a fine line between horri-fying, amazing, death-defying skills and comic relief. ” 
Every skill requires a different 
set. Unicycle took Sibert over a month of daily practice to master, and the three-ball juggle a month on top of that. Now, she can juggle five balls or three clubs —  seven, 
if passing to a partner — and is an enthused member of the Muir College Juggling Club. 
As for the more complicated 
tricks, Sibert said she has never been afraid of learning new aerial maneu-vers — even when she’s dangling upside down, 25 feet above solid ground (no net, no mat), suspended by nothing but silk ribbons and con-fidence in her own talents. 
Sibert said she has never been 
injured while doing any of the stunts.
“There’s definitely times when I 
think that what I’m doing is crazy, but with the right mentality, anyone can do it, ” she said. “I’ve learned how to trust myself, and know what’s safe and what isn’t. ”
Shock value isn’t the only upside 
of the circus for Sibert; she said she also digs the close-knit dynamic of the circus community — her second family.
“The circus is one of the few 
places where every single human being is accepted as the core of who he or she is, ” Sibert said. “There’s no need to put on a face. Y ou’re accepted point-blank with no strings attached. Y ou support each other. ” 
Despite her apparent passion 
for the circus, Sibert said her aerial aspirations almost fizzled out com-pletely when she first arrived to UCSD. 
“There was the Muir Juggling 
Club, but I couldn’t find anything with aerials, so I was just going to focus on school. I thought, ‘I’m done for now. ’”
Turned out she was wrong.“I happened across someone who 
needed an aerial partner through another person in the Muir Juggling Club, ” Sibert said. “Within a quarter I was heavily involved. ”
Now, Sibert trains and coaches 
with what she describes as “a group of people who have found each other over the years” — a new circus family.
What does the future hold for 
this one-wheeled campus won-der? Sibert said though she does have aspirations to pursue marine biology at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, she is heavily con-sidering taking a gap year before 
graduate school to travel with a pro-fessional circus. 
“Circus isn’t something that can 
wait until after I obtain my PhD. The tricks are rough on the body, ” Sibert said. “It’s in my blood, in my life. ”

10,000 issues.later release trapped gasses when 
crushed in the lab.
According to Hilton, when hot 
lava hits seawater, it freezes almost instantly inside a shell of glass. Because the particular volcanoes that formed Iceland erupted beneath glaciers, their magma froze espe-cially quickly — creating ideal glass samples for tests such as Hilton’s, packed tight with gasses frozen in their original states. Compared to more common, superficial “sub-duction” volcanoes, which end up recycling their own elements as one plate of land slides under the other, Iceland’s 130-plus volcanoes are spewing material from up to 2,900 kilometers down.
In this way, Hilton said Iceland’s 
trapped volcanic gasses could teach us about the conditions of early Earth. When compared to meteorite samples, they could reveal similari-ties between our planet’s deep man-tle and the primordial composition of the solar system. Or, when com-pared to modern volcanic material, they could demonstrate the changes Earth’s atmosphere has undergone since then.
“If you adopt a holistic approach, 
you want everything, ” he said. “Y ou want the deep stuff in Iceland, and you want the shallow stuff in the subduction zones. And in fact, that’s what I do. Any kind of volcano, I’m interested in. ”
Indeed, Hilton seems to have 
a soft spot for all things volcanic. Originally from England, the Scripps researcher and professor is the friendly library type, with British teeth and the kind of voice that could score him a gig in Discovery Channel narration; the kind of soothing, all-knowing forefather voice that makes even the most eye-crossing geographical jargon a thing of fascination. In Hilton’s travel pho-tos — sticking a tube into a pile of mud or grinning his windbreaker off in front of a volcano — he radiates 
the simple glamour of a man and his science.
“What 
tourists do is go out and about to see the scenery, which is what we’re doing anyway — but with a pur-pose, ” he said.
On last 
year’s final trip north, Hilton round-ed up one particularly pure Icelandic sample: 
Sæmundur Halldórsson, a University of Iceland graduate student.
“[Halldórsson] has been out and 
about in Iceland so much, that he virtually knows every hill, and every valley, and every lava flow, ” Hilton said. “ And he can tell you the differ-ence between this lava flow and that lava flow — it’s fantastic. ”
Halldórsson, a classically rosy-
cheeked, towheaded islander, fol-lowed the famed geochemist back to Scripps with wife and music student Berglind Maria Tómasdóttir in tow — who likewise transferred her stud-ies to the UCSD music department. They are new parents to a two-month-old baby girl named Anna Signy, and plan to see their doctor-ates through for four or five years before returning to Iceland.
Tómasdóttir, who is a contem-
porary flutist, described Iceland’s intimate, “vibrant” music scene as “basically a group of people that play in all the different bands. ”In describing the folks back 
home, both Icelanders agreed that the island’s natural environment has a lot to do with the way the popula-tion is shaped.
“Geographically, there’s a lot of 
energy, ” Tómasdóttir said. “ And they believe they can do almost every-thing. ”
“But it’s like a balloon of air, ” 
Halldórsson said.
“Not really, ” continued 
Tómasdóttir. “But sometimes it would be better to be a little more organized. But the energy is there. ”
Kind of ironic, Halldórsson 
admitted, leaving behind studies in geography at the University of Iceland (under the wing of professor Karl Gronvold, who Hilton first met back in 1983, and who participated in the team’s recent field work) to coop himself up in the Scripps lab with small pieces of his home coun-try. But Halldórsson said Hilton has also encouraged him to work with samples from other volcanic areas around the world.
“Hilton really wants me to think 
about something other than Iceland, ” he said.
The graduate student won’t 
run out of material anytime soon; Hilton takes a dizzying amount of fieldtrips to keep the sample sup-ply on overflow. His most recent expedition was to Eastern Turkey — where he collected samples from a fault similar to the San Andreas Fault here in California — but he’s also been to Africa, Japan, China, Indonesia, Hawaii and sites all over Latin America in the last few years alone.
Halldórsson noted that he would 
never have ended up at Scripps if it hadn’t been for his hotspot home-town.

I’m interested in earth science is because I grew up in Iceland. ”
Much has changed in Iceland 
since Hilton’s wide-eyed expedi-tion in 1983, when he said he was surprised to find the country had no pubs — a.k.a. no beer — and no TV on Thursdays. However, Halldórsson said he’s seen a definite Western shift in what was once a more quiet, iso-lated lifestyle.
“Iceland is fairly Americanized, 
actually, ” Halldórsson said. “So we have all these fast-food chains and rubbish all around us. ”
But there have also been many 
advances in research equipment over the last couple decades, including the technology needed to measure the isotope ratio in nitrogen — a large motivating factor for the most recent leg of the Iceland project. In order to extract the nitrogen from the Iceland samples, graduate student Barry first had to learn how to construct a nitrogen extraction line.
Thing is, the only other place on 
Earth where anyone was interested in such a contraption was the University of Tokyo. So Barry flew overseas for a crash course, then brought that knowledge back to Scripps, where it took him a year to re-create the line, at which point — much to the delight of his partners in noble-gas geochem-istry — the nitrogen isotopes were finally ready to be measured by the mass spectrometer.
“We’re chained to our mass spec-
trometers, ” Halldórsson said. 
After working with Hilton for 
over five years in the field of noble-gas geochemistry, graduate student Füri has released the first draft of her doctoral dissertation: four separate reports on research she’s done in Monterey Bay, Costa Rica, the Central Indian Ridge and — of course — Iceland.
“What’s striking when you get 
there, is there are almost no trees, ” Füri said. “ And of course, for a geol-
ogist, that’s amazing, because it’s all 
lava — all rock. ”
She said that gas samples from 
subaerial Iceland were more dif-ficult to analyze than those from the other three underwater loca-tions included in her dissertation, because much of the lava ended up being de-gassed, or contaminated by air.
“We don’t want [the samples] to 
be weathered or eroded — we want 
them to be quite fresh — but they can still be several million years old, ” Füri said.
In the end, however, the team 
collected and tested enough original deep-mantle material to confirm and advance previous, 
more piecemeal research showing 
that volcanic material in Iceland is indeed very similar to the Earth’s primordial composition, and that its gasses can even be compared to solar wind.
“I mean, it’s kind of the question 
of, why do we care?” Füri said. “But Earth is so unique. I just think it’s important that we know more about 
the planet we live on. ”

took off on an 8-1 run, marked by clutch kills from Schmidt and a solid defense. 
While much of the Tritons’  suc-
cess this season has been generated by the team’s offense, defensive play-ers proved just as decisive this time around: Most of the Coyotes’ hits were handled and passed on target. 
The Coyotes could not muster 
much offensive strength as UCSD cruised to a 25-16 victory in the second set.
“The girls did what they trained 
to do, ” head coach Tom Black said. “They kept doing what they needed to do. There’s no magic involved. ”
Though the second set left the 
Coyotes looking defeated and the Tritons poised to sweep the con-ference leaders, Cal State San Bernardino turned in a solid third-game performance to claw back into the game. 
A Triton offense that had been 
stellar for the first two sets could not penetrate the Coyote block, and Cal State San Bernardino won its first set 25-13.
The Coyotes started strong in 
the fourth set, jumping out to an early lead. As San Bernardino pow-ered through the UCSD defense, the Triton bench — fueled by the cheer-ing crowd — expressed their disap-proval of a referee’s call, resulting in a yellow card for the UCSD bench. 
The penalty only served to cata-lyze the Triton players, and UCSD surged past the Coyotes to grab a 21-19 lead.
After a pair of San Bernardino 
time outs — and with a 23-19 lead — the Tritons finished the match with a resounding block to secure the win and seek revenge against the only team to have beaten them this season.
“The best part is that 
we beat them, ” Schmidt said. “We had a great crowd tonight, and they’re kind of a rival for us. ”
The night before tak-
ing on the Coyotes, UCSD went up against the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos, a team the Tritons had already defeated early in the season. In the first set of the night, sopho-more outside hitter Katie Condon quickly put down eight kills in the set. 
UCSD jumped out to an early 
lead, with Chen leading the charge by setting tight balls on the net and ringing up multiple assists. 
The Tritons’ offense was relent-
less, and Schmidt continued the powerful swings. Redshirt freshman middle blocker Julia Freidenberg provided crucial blocks on potential Bronco kills, as the Tritons cruised to a 25-18 victory. 
“Elaine’s setting was awesome, ” 
Condon said. “We wanted to start strong, and that’s what we did. ”
In the second set, UCSD took 
advantage of several key Bronco mis-takes. The Tritons easily overpow-
ered Pomona and raced to a 25-11 victory with more solid hitting and a game-winning kill from Condon.
“We were really 
focused, ” Black said. “We didn’t make many errors in the set, and were able to win. ”
Looking to avoid a 
three-set sweep, Cal Poly Pomona came out tough in the third set. The Broncos played resilient-ly, and the Tritons were 
unable to pull away. 
Cal Poly Pomona 
battled the Tritons evenly throughout the set and pulled within two scores 
to 18-16 — before UCSD went on another solid run to finish off the game with a final score of 25-21.
The Tritons begin their second 
half of conference play on Oct. 21, when they travel to Cal State Dominguez Hills to play a night match, before returning home on Oct. 23 to play Cal State Los Angeles.

chances in the game’s final two and one-half minutes, but two untimely turnovers cost the Tritons a chance at victory.  
 After taking a 2-0 lead early in 
the game, both teams traded goals one-for-one on 15 consecutive scores — a testament to evenly matched and gritty performances from both teams. Donohoe, Gresham and junior driver Ryan Allred each picked up two goals for the Tritons, who have lost two out of their past three nail-bitting matches. 
The ability to stay close to some 
of the nation’s top-ranked teams gives UCSD the poise and confi-dence to battle through their current skid, failing to get above .500 all season long.
“Right now it’s just about a lot of 
guys getting their confidence back and getting back in their groove, and playing like we were during the offseason, ” Morton said. “Since I’ve been in his program, I’ve noticed that our team progressively gets better throughout the course of the season. It’s a matter of putting all the right pieces together and getting our com-posure back. ”
The Tritons hit the road again for 
a five-game trip through Southern California from Oct. 23 to Oct. 31. 
The trip starts with a match against UC Irvine in a rematch of Oct. 11’s game which saw the Tritons drop a 8-7 match. The Southern California tour and three-game home stand that follows will be UCSD’s final prepa-ration for the Western Water Polo Association Championships, begin-ning Nov. 20.
Readers can contact Jake Blanc at  
jblanc@ucsd.edu.▶ WATER POLO, MYVTWHNLFriday, allowing a season-high three 
scores. Outshooting UCSD 7-1 in the first half, the Toros scored on a header off the cross for a 1-0 lead. 
UCSD didn’t get on the board 
until the Toros netted their third and final goal in the 79th minute. Senior midfielder Kyle Parton broke away from the defense for his first career goal, cutting CSUDH’s lead to 3-1 in the 85th minute. 
Parton earned an assist on junior 
midfielder David Bakal’s goal in the 89th, which brought the Tritons  within one score. However, UCSD’s early deficit proved too deep to over-come when they fell 3-2.
“Our approach was to put 
pressure on [Dominguez Hills] and not let them get in a rhythm. Dominguez Hills never felt com-fortable, but they were able to capi-talize on our mistakes, ” Pascale said. “We were able to get a few goals late and definitely made it interesting, and our guys showed a lot of charac-ter, sticking with the game plan the whole time. ”
The fourth-place Tritons now 
return home to face Cal State San Bernardino, sitting in third place, and fifth-place Cal Poly Pomona in the California Collegiate Athletic Association South Division. The last time they faced those two squads this season, the Tritons lost to the Coyotes 1-0 and beat the Broncos by the same score.
“ At this point, we’ve seen every-
body once this season, and we don’t feel like there’s anybody we can’t beat. ”

TENNIS — After defeating a doubles 
team from Sonoma State on Oct. 3 and earning the title of Intercollegiate Tennis Association West Region Doubles Champions, junior Armaun Emami and redshirt freshman Austin West advanced to the ITA National Small College Championship in Mobile, Ala. from Oct. 15 to Oct. 18.
The Triton duo emerged from the 
competition in fourth place after a strong showing on Oct. 15, but two losses the following day ended their run at an ITA national title.
In the championship’s open-ing match, Emami and West faced Midwestern State University’s Vjekoslav Stipanic and Bo Ziputovic in the quarterfinals. Stipanic and Ziputovic entered the match with a 10-1 record.
Undaunted by their opponent’s 
impressive record, Emami and West beat Stipanic and Ziputovic 7-6, 6-2 in a tough battle. After winning a gruelling first set with an 8-5 tie-breaker, the pair pulled away in the second set for an easy victory.
“It was a battle for that first set, ” 
UCSD assistant coach Timmer Willing said. “ After the tiebreaker win, they relaxed and settled in. We made a few adjustments to our strat-egy, and it took the other team out of their rhythm. ”
West, in his first competitive sea-
son as a Triton, said he was happy with the dynamic between him and teammate Emami.
“It was the first time we’ve com-peted together in doubles, but I think our playing styles match up well, ” West said. “We certainly complement each other. ”
Emami finished No. 2 in the 2009 
spring season with a 4-1 record. For most of the previous doubles season, he was paired with sophomore Chapman Chan, who is currently paired with redshirt junior Alex Placek.
On the tournament’s sec-
ond day, Emami and West faced Francis Marion University’s Oshada Wijemanne and Dilshod Sharifi, the No. 2 seeded team in the champion-ship. The opponent had trounced a team from Southern Indiana  the 
previous day. 
The game did not end well for 
Emami and West either, losing in straight sets 6-0, 6-0.
Following the difficult loss, Emami 
and West had the chance to salvage one last win at the ITA National Small College Championship with a match 
against Bloomsburg University’s Fernando Perez and Ricky Dove in the battle for third place. 
However, 6-2 and 6-3 falls guar-
anteed the Triton duo a fourth-place finish at the championship.
“We’ll try to learn from our mis-
takes today, ” West said. “It was a battle out there, and we need to figure out how to beat the better teams. ”
UCSD’s last appearance at the  
ITA Championship  was in 2007, 
when seniors Eric Rubens and Blake Meister clinched the doubles event.
The Tritons will participate 
in their next competition at the Southern California Intercollegiates in Los Angeles from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8. The five-day event will be the final competition of the Triton’s fall season before they take a break from com-petitive play until February.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — 
Motivated by the thunderous applause from the homecoming weekend crowd, the UCSD women’s volleyball team defeated No. 2 Cal 
State San Bernardino in four games, handing the Coyotes their first loss of the season. 
The hype surrounding UCSD’s homecoming weekend was a boost for the Tritons in their most impor-tant match of the season — filling the stands with former alumni and family, along with throngs of spirited students. 
The women avenged their only 
loss of the season, a Sept. 11 fall to the same San Bernardino squad. The Tritons are now tied for first place with the Coyotes in the California Collegiate Athletic Conference and now sport a 20-1 overall record, 12-1 in-conference.
“It feels amazing to get the win, ” 
senior captain setter Elaine Chen said. “I’m proud of the team for what we’ve accomplished. ”In the first set of the night, San 
Bernardino came out strong with a powerful offensive attack, but the Tritons adjusted and regained momentum early in the set.
“They had powerful hitters, ” 
senior captain outside hitter Sylvia Schmidt — who finished the night with a team-leading 18 kills — said. “We just focused and played well and passed well. ”
UCSD demonstrated a calm 
demeanor early on, putting the Coyotes  down 25-19 in the first set 
of the match, with Schmidt deliver-ing the game-winning kill.
In the second set, the Tritons 
capitalized on key Coyote errors, but a slew of their own mistakes early on kept UCSD from grabbing con-trol. With the score tied 6-6, UCSD ,MRI>]¸

MEN’S WATER POLO — In a 
repeat of the 2009 season opener, UCSD hosted the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos in a non-conference match on Oct. 16 at the Coggan Family Aquatic Complex. 
Much like their first game nearly 
two months ago, the Tritons bat-tled to stay close with the Gauchos throughout the match, but saw a late rally fall short as they were defeated 9-7. 
The loss drops UCSD’s record to 
9-10 on the season, and the Gauchos improve to 9-6. 
Despite the tough loss, sopho-
more goalkeeper David Morton said he had high hopes for the regular season’s eight remaining games.
“I expect our team to improve; I’m 
not too worried about our record, ” Morton said. “It is a losing record, but we’ve played a lot of competitive games and lost a lot of close games. I don’t think our record really reflects how we’re doing to a certain extent, because the majority of our games have been against top-10 opponents. ”
UCSB took control early in the 
game, scoring two goals in the first three minutes to open the first period. Senior two-meter defender Steven Donohoe cut the Gaucho lead in half by converting on a penalty shot to put UCSD on the board. He added another goal two minutes later, and the first period ended with a 4-2 UCSB advantage. 
Both teams exchanged goals 
evenly during the second and third periods, as the Gauchos clung to their two-score lead heading into the game’s final frame. 
Senior two-meter defender Peter 
Gresham led a fourth-period Triton attack that nearly resulted in a come-from-behind victory. Just 38 seconds into the final period, Gresham scored to pull within one of the Gauchos, but UCSB rebounded with a goal of its own 30 seconds later.
After two more possessions, 
the Tritons scored off a shot from Gresham to once again pull within one goal of their opponents — but, as was the pattern in the game, UCSB immediately scored to regain its two-

MEN’S SOCCER — Coming off a 
two-game sweep of conference cel-
lar dwellers Cal State East Bay, the Tritons faced off against teams at the top of their division last weekend. UCSD was unable to pull out an upset in either match, losing two con-secutive one-goal road games. 
After falling behind 3-0 on Oct. 
16, the Tritons mounted a comeback in the final minutes against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, but failed to erase 
the deficit.
Playing against Cal State Los Angeles on Oct. 18, UCSD was again unable to get on the board, taking the 1-0 defeat.
Following the series, UCSD’s con-
ference record drops to 4-5-3 enter-ing a game this Friday against Cal State San Bernardino.
Though UCSD’s defense played 
consistently well throughout Saturday’s match, the Triton offense struggled to create scoring opportu-nities on Sunday against the Toros.
In the first half, UCSD did not 
attempt a single shot on goal. On the other side of the ball, senior goal-keeper Peter Akman sent away all 14 of CSULA ’s shots. 
Starting the second half scoreless, 
the Golden Eagles wasted no time getting on the board, netting a goal in the 48th minute. The Tritons man-aged five shots in the second half, but 
none of them got through CSULA ’s 
defense. “I think that Cal State Los Angeles 
did a great job making it hard [for us] to get in a rhythm, ” head coach John Pascale said. “They put a lot of pressure on the ball making life dif-
ficult for us. It was a combination of 
them being really good and us being a little off. ”
Akman recorded a career-high 11 
saves in the game, but UCSD’s offense was unable to support its goalkeeper in the Tritons’ fifth shutout of the season. 
“Peter is an experienced goalkeep-
er, and he did for us what he’s been 
doing all year, ” Pascale said. “His 
saves were excellent, but were well within his capabilities. He reads the game well and is very good techni-cally. ”
