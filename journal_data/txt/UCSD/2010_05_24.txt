Fee Policy 
Raises NewQuestions

The UC Board of Regents’ approval to 
revisions to the mandatory system reg-istration fees has raised concern that 
the money will be used for educational funding rather than servings its original purpose of fur-thering student life. 
The registration fee — officially renamed 
the Student Services Fee, as of May 19 — exists within the UC Student Fee Policy, which also includes the sys-temwide educational fee. The $300-per-quarter fee has traditionally funded student resources such as counseling and psychologi-cal services, as well as some social activities.
The Student Fee Policy 
was last revised on Nov. 19, 2009, when the regents voted to raise both the reg-istration and educational fee by a total of 32 percent — leading to widespread student outcry, several protests and the March 4 Day of Action, during which students across the nation rallied in support of public education. 
According to graduate student and 
Registration Fee Advisory Committee Chair Erik Van Esselstyn, the new guidelines for the Student Services Fee allow the money to be put toward non-service resources, such as funding enroll-

Existing within a system that weath-
ered an $813 million drop in state 
funding last year — and facing 
another direct $7 million cut next year — the academic departments of UCSD rely on a delicately budgeted balance between uni-versity money and grants toward research in the sciences and arts. 
Control of departmental funding begins 
in the UC Office of the President, then trick-les down to the UCSD office of Academic Affairs, individual division heads and then department heads themselves. 
According to Chief Financial Officer 
for Academic Affairs Debbie McGraw, her office divides the university’s pool of funds — consisting of student fees, state funds and grants — between five recipients: arts and humanities, physical sciences, biologi-cal sciences, engineering and social sci-ences.  The divisions each house individ-ual departments — for example, arts and 
humanities is composed of the philosophy, 
literature, music, theatre and dance, visual arts, and history departments.
The size of each share varies by division 
and is reallocated every fiscal year. This year, Academic Affairs allocated approxi-mately $36.4 billion among the divisions. Of this amount, about $6.1 million was allocated to the arts and humanities divi-sion, $7.4 million to social sciences, $10.2 million to engineering, $7.7 million to physical sciences and $5 million to biologi-cal sciences. 
“Every department has a permanent 
support budget, ” McGraw said. “That means that there is a certain amount of dollars that — unless someone comes to actively cut or add to it — they can count 
Final budget based on how 
much money each academicdivision — such as humanities and biological sciences — receives from outside sources.Registration fee committee, Office of the President disagree on the effect of revised $900 student fee.

KEVIN  WU/GUARDIANThe last Non-Sexist Dance of 
the year, hosted by UCSD LGBTQIA, 
abandoned its traditional Porter’s Pub venue in favor of the roomier Price Center Plaza. Over 600 people showed up for the event on Friday night, which — unlike all Non-Sexist Dances this year — did not reach capacity. 
Because a Non-Sexist Dance was 
cancelled in February due to the “Compton Cookout,” controversy, there were more funds available for this one-time splurge on a larger, pricier venue.
However, event organizer James 
Small said the change is not perma-nent. 
“We love Porter’s,” he said. “We 
have zero reason to want to leave.”
Next Fall Quarter, though, the dance 
will return to its usual home in Porter’s. Small added that the last dance of the year will likely continue to take place in its new location — hopefully allowing more students to participate in the bi-quarterly, queer-friendly bash.

www.ucsdguardian.orgon it every year. This is a budget that 
is specifically set for staff and for other support needs — telephones, supplies, supporting the class labs. ”
McGraw said Academic Affairs 
bases its allocations on factors such as the number of faculty members in each division, the number of stu-dents enrolled in each division and the amount of outside grant support the divisions receive. 
Of all the undergraduates on 
campus, only 9 percent have not declared a major. Thirty-six percent, on the other hand, have chosen the social-science division — the largest of the divisions, home to 342 faculty members. The arts-and-humanities division contains 276 faculty and 8 percent of undergraduates, whereas engineering has 226 faculty mem-bers and 18 percent of undergradu-ates.  The physical-science division has 255 faculty members and 9 percent of undergraduates, whereas biological science has only 88 fac-ulty members but 20 percent of the undergraduates.
Divisional funding is also heavily impacted by grant activity, since the science 
divisions are much more likely to bring in non-state funds.
Unlike the funds allocated by 
the university, grant money is gifted to individual faculty members or research groups who seek funding from outside sources.
Last year, as illustrated in the 
graph on page one, the grant activ-ity total was only $360,000 for arts and humanities and $2.9 million for social sciences, whereas engineer-ing received $46.1 million in grants, physical sciences received $28.5 mil-lion and biological sciences received $22.7 million. 
McGraw said that another factor 
Academic Affairs takes into account is need — for example, the engineer-ing department receives the most outside funding, but it also receives the most divisional funding because of the high cost of computers, soft-ware and other equipment that the arts and humanities department might not need. 
“Special fac-
tors that we look at include the sci-ences, which have lab courses that drive certain costs, and the arts, which have performances that drive certain costs, ” McGraw said. “We try to compare one against another when we figure out how much money to give or cut. ”
If grants are 
taken into account, the amount a divi-sion receives from Academic Affairs is often an inaccurate estimation of the overall money that departments are receiving. 
“ Arts and humanities has the 
three humanities departments — lit-erature, history and philosophy — and they have three art departments: theater, visual arts and music, ” McGraw said. “They have very com-plicated staffing needs to support 
their productions. So if you look at humanities versus arts, there’s not the same funding across the board. The humanities do have less. And they don’t have contracts and grants to manage. They don’t have costly laboratories. ”
According to McGraw, once all 
these factors are taken into account, each division receives a fair amount of funding every year. 
Once funds are allocated to the divisions, the dean of each division then evalu-
ates similar factors — like the num-
ber of faculty members, the number of students enrolled in that divi-sion and the amount of outside grants provided — within his or her area to decide how to allo-cate money to individual departments. 
“The departments go 
through a similar pro-cess: They look at work-load, what needs are, how many enrollments and how many majors, ” McGraw said. “They try to blend it together. ”
According to 
Associate Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education Barbara 
Sawrey, the Office of Academic Affairs sets aside money for each department’s faculty and teaching-assistant salaries, but otherwise does not control how the divisions allo-cate the remaining funds. 
“ Academic Affairs provides fund-
ing to the departments, but it is the departments that determine how to set their own spending priorities, ” Sawrey said. “We do not manage the expenditures. ”
Arts and Humanities Assistant 
Dean Heath Fox said department allocations are very rigid, as there are certain pools of money that must be used for certain purposes, such as office supplies. To allocate the remaining money, the dean consid-ers factors such as enrollment levels and varying numbers and requests of faculty members in each depart-ment.
Although Academic Affairs sets 
money aside for salaries, teaching assistants and supplies, the deans take care of more curriculum-related expenses — like paying for servic-es such as temporary lecturers. He added that deans gauge the “need” for certain services as requested by faculty. 
“We are guided by the faculty 
in the department and what they articulate as the need, ” Fox said. “That’s the biggest factor: what sup-port requirements the departments have. And the second biggest factor is going to be the total amount of money that’s available in different funding categories. Those are basi-cally the two things that will guide all the funding decisions. ”
McGraw said she is unsure of how 
academic divisions will be funded in the 2010–11 fiscal year, considering the budget cut of $7 million she said will be implemented next year.
“We’re trying to figure out how 
to allocate a budget cut of about $7 million dollars, ” McGraw said. “Seven million is a big number, and we’re kind of looking at three years in the future. Whatever number each division gets cut, we’re going to give them time to achieve it. Still, it’s going to be a cut they’re all going to have to take. ”

God Festival — as we all grasped to fading memo-
ries of freedom — came a buzz kill for the books: The UCSD Native American Student Alliance released a statement condemning those who had decorated themselves with face paint, feathers and headdresses on the day of the festival.
According to NASA, the students’ faux-tribal 
attire — aside from degrading Native-American tradition — contributed to negative cultural ste-reotypes on campus.
“ As students at UCSD we should not have to 
see our cultures mocked and ridiculed during a student sponsored event taking place at our uni-versity, ” the alliance said in an online statement.
It’s no doubt that, after Winter Quarter’s 
“Compton Cookout” fiasco, the UCSD student population could use a lesson or two in cultural sensitivity. The frat-planned party that mocked a disadvantaged California community — followed by a string of other racist events — warranted immediate response from the Black Student Union, and demonstrated a dire need for educa-tional and outreach efforts. 
The case of the Sun God headdress, however, 
is a different story. First off, as a Sun God celebra-tor who peppered her hair with gold feathers the day of, I’ d argue many costumed students never intended to emulate traditional American-Indian dress, but rather the aesthetic of the statue itself.
The festival’s winged inspiration, after all, was 
created by artist Nikki St. Phalle’s indigenous handbrush. Even with all artistic classification aside, it’s still a bird splashed in primary colors — perfectly crowned with a row of gold feathers.
Maybe there were a handful of Sun God 
enthusiasts who, after downing a few shots on the

Y our abysmal coverage of Justice in 
Palestine Week and the Horowitz fias-co reeks of Hearstian and Horowitzian journalism.
While you sought to clarify my 
answer in your May 20 article entitled “Students Clash Anew Over Israeli-Palestinian Conflicts, ” you chose not to qualify it with my position. I will do you a favor and quote it from my statement directly. “My opinion of Hamas is not as simple as condemn or condone, for it or against it. I firmly believe that the killing of civilians, even as collateral damage regardless of creed, politics, sexuality, nationality or ethnicity is one of the highest crimes in the eyes of God and is morally rep-rehensible and abhorrent. ”
Secondly, Hezbollah is not a 
Palestinian faction — it is Lebanese. Hamas (regardless of its designa-tion as a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S.) is neither geno-cidal nor Holocaust-denying. This 
is simply evident in Y ale University’s 
copy of Article 20 of the Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement, which analogizes Israel’s treatment of Palestinians to Nazi treatment of Jews, and Article Six, which calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state where people of all religions can coex-ist in peace. Y our fact-checking should at least consist of Googling either 
organization’s name.
Y oung Americans for Freedom 
chairwoman Gabriella Hoffman is 
quoted saying that she feels hurt that I would want to kill her and other Jews. Barzilay claims that the apartheid wall makes her feel “alienated” and demands that I apologize. These indi-viduals have no right to speak of hurt, alienation or apology whatsoever. It was Hoffman, acting as chair of Y oung Americans for Freedom, who invited and introduced David Horowitz. It was Barzilay’s organization, Tritons for Israel, which initially tri-sponsored the event and had many of its members in attendance. Those students were not threatened or preoccupied by my sup-posed “racist” sentiments. When I left, one member followed me out, brushed aside my attempts at clarification and admitted that she knew I had misspo-ken, given Horowitz’s reputation.
Horowitz was not invited to pres-
ent any argument or engage in con-structive dialogue — rather, he was brought because of his reputation for racism and hatemongering against Arabs and Muslims. If anyone can claim alienation or marginalization, it’s me. For the university to allow him to set foot on my campus using my 
student fees is a slap in my face and a slap in the face of all other non-Jewish minorities on this campus. Need more proof? Google this article: “Guns Don’t Kill Black People, Other Blacks Do. ” Tell me: Who needs to apologize now?
As far as the sense of “alienation” 
that the apartheid wall heralds: The 
panels and speakers criticized the 
Israeli government, not the Jewish people. Professors and lecturers at this university urge us to examine our own 
government. Why should the universi-ty or A.S. Council entertain the notion that the Israeli government is holier than our own and beyond reproach?
The voices of the Palestinian peo-
ple have been silenced by the main-
stream media for too long, and I refuse 
to silence my own voice to appease the twisted politics of the pro-Israel com-munities on and off campus.

Dear Editor,
It disgusts and saddens me that a 
Palestinian student at UCSD has to defend herself against the wordplay of Horowitz and is being blamed for supporting genocide, while her own people are suffering from acts of racial violence on the scale of genocide on a daily basis. Only at UCSD could such a backward discussion be made into headline news. The entire situation was instigated by Tritons For Israel, who purposely invited a hateful, anti-Palestinian figure to speak at UCSD during Justice in Palestine Week. What’s next, KKK speakers during Black History Month? One of the first lessons in critical race theory is that counterattack — blaming the victim — is a common strategy for avoiding 
blame, and it’s used by people commit-
ting acts of racism just as it is used by perpetrators of domestic violence.
As an alumnus of UCSD who is 
now a lecturer here, I want to make my support for Palestine clear. When students ask how much money is spent on Justice in Palestine Week, even though they may not understand its importance, I have to ask how 
much money is spent on support for 
Israel on this campus. How much money goes to developing nuclear weapons, and how much money goes to animal testing? There are a whole host of things on this campus that I don’t agree with, but the purpose of a university is to provide a space for intellectual inquiry, and to open stu-dents’ minds to the injustice of their own society. Spending a few thousand dollars bringing to light the crimes of the No. 1 recipient of military aid from the U.S. is an excellent way to spend money, in my view.
That the article “Students Clash 
Anew Over Israeli-Palestinian Conflict” called into question the qual-ity of the speakers is a further insult. Angela Davis, a world-renowned scholar, activist and alumna of UCSD, was only one of the brilliantly chosen speakers who the Muslim Student Association — in all its hard work — brought to our campus.
To quote the Mexican-American-
studies department of the Tucson Unified School District, our goal here should be to “work toward the invok-ing of a critical consciousness within each and every student” and “promote and advocate for social and education-al transformation. ” Justice in Palestine Week is one of the most important events our campus holds annually, and it should get more funding instead of less, in light of the growing racial intol-erance this campus is supporting.

Biased Against Palestine
Justice for Palestine Week 
Should Receive More FundsSince my only-child upbringing 
exhausted any need for attention a decade ago, I’m not usually one 
to ask for cheap pity. In the hope that I might spare others such a harrowing fate, though, I’ll share my story: Last weekend, I sustained an injury. A seri-ous one. The kind that makes you beg mercy from whatever cruel, senseless higher power has left you with insom-nia and a burning red rash (on the shoulder, sicko). 
Though I am no doctor, I’m 
reasonably sure I know where the problem started. After spending a rare Saturday in a tank top under the sun, I later awoke with a sore shoulder. Having been born — as some cultur-ally insensitive individuals call my kind — a “ginger, ” I’m no stranger to the phenomenon of the sunburn. But I was also certain my pus-covered shoulder was no mere sunburn. Sunburns don’t keep you up all night, and they definitely don’t ooze deadly fluids. 
Twenty minutes of WebMD.com 
research later, I arrived at an alarming self-diagnosis that did little to alleviate my fears. Apparently, if one remains under the sun for an extended period of time without any protection, he becomes subject to something called “sun poisoning” — a term I still do not entirely understand, but nevertheless frightened me into making good on the site’s suggestion to consult a doctor. 
In what must have been a personal 
record, I arrived at Student Health a full 10 minutes before it opened. There I stood in line behind an assembly of snifflers and wheezers. God, I thought, 
What a luxury to have such a treatable, obvious condition as a common cold .
Once the doors opened, it was a 
mad dash to the urgent-care recep-tionist, but I managed to fill out the requisite form with lightning precision. “Severe rash on shoulder, ” I reported, “Since Saturday. ” I resisted the urge to underline for dramatic effect. The statement spoke for itself. 
Upon rehashing the salient details 
of my story to the doctor — overexpo-sure to the sun; insomnia; enormous, pus-filled welts — I was asked to kindly remove my shirt so that “we” could have a better look. 
After a thorough 10-second 
examination, the good doctor had arrived at his diagnosis: It was, in strict medical terminology, a ... sun-burn. Or, more specifically, a blister-ing sunburn — which would account for the menacing pockets of air lining my shoulder. 
We sat in awkward silence as the 
doctor tried his best not to make light of my hysteria, typing up a two-page 
treatment plan with such eye-opening 
recommendations as “wear longer shirts, use hats and apply sunscreen. ”
When — in a final attempt at 
proving my sensibility — I asserted that I’ d never suffered such a pain-ful reaction to the sun, the doctor mentioned that such inexperience was probably symptomatic of a larger, graver life circumstance: “generally 
good parenting. ”
Thank you, Mom and Dad, for 
slathering me in sunscreen every day 
of elementary school. Maybe next time, though, I’ll wait another day or two before braving the doctor’s office. I’ d hate for my next diagnosis to be hypochondria. <PMZM¼[6W

THE RIVETER By Ronnie Steinitz
For More Than a Chancellor’s Nod, Choose Your Battles
eve of the festival, thought it’ d be fun 
to throw on their old “Pocahontas” costumes, but most of us were paying respect to the festival’s namesake. If our beloved party God also happens to remind a small group of students of their cultural heritage, cool — the more, the merrier.
But even if we’re talking about 
those who did aim to sport some Sioux-inspired gear because they thought it looked cool, it’s unclear why that would be classified as mock-ery. If students had decked themselves in moccasins and paint and skipped around howling a sarcastic war cry, I’ d say we had another Cookout on our hands. But, seeing as they were simply borrowing from the culture’s style because they think it’s awesome, it seems like more of a case of flattery in the form of imitation. America is a melting pot of heritage and tradi-tion; many a white boy has donned a kurta to demonstrate respect for the Indian culture, or a toga for the Greeks. While American-Indians have faced especially violent hard-ship in the U.S. — which shouldn’t be downplayed — that doesn’t take away a collective right to appreciate their art and culture.
NASA argued that these acts “are 
a product of the ever-diminishing Native American presence on UCSD, ” and demanded administrators up edu-cation and outreach in response. 
While there are indeed pressing 
reasons to boost the American-Indian presence on campus, NASA is hurt-ing its case by singling out these arbitrary incidents. Isolating students — who, in their decision to plaster 
their bodies with paint and feathers, were not acting out of ignorance, but celebration — will only alienate those who are otherwise on NASA ’s side. Unfortunately, as was the case with last quarter’s Cookout controversy, unless a minority group can communicate its reasons for upset clearly to the rest of the clued-out campus, its message will sound like nothing more than a whine to those who need to hear it most. 
So pick your battles, and we’ll stick 
with you when they’re worth fighting. But if you keep crying “Cookout” at every turn, all you’ll ever get is a string of e-mails from Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s PR slaves detailing the importance of cultural sensitivity until we’re completely desensitized.

After winning the Miss USA 
pageant on May 16, Lebanese 
immigrant Rima Fakih has since expe-rienced a flood of backlash from critics who say that because she’s Muslim, she doesn’t accurately represent America — and that her ties with a terrorist nation make her title undeserved.
In particular, Fakih has received 
conservative backlash over her name — which a few Hezbollah officials allegedly share. Radical pundits like columnist Debbie Schlussel have fueled an absurd rumor that Fakih is a terrorist, which birthed the unoriginal nickname “Miss Hezbollah. ” 
The suspicion that Fakih has 
anything to do with Hezbollah is embarrassing to our collective national intelligence. Claiming that her last name ties her to a militant group is on par with the assumption during World War II that every Japanese citizen was an enemy.
Fakih’s story — which helped 
to make this year’ s string of candi-dates more representative of modern America than that of the blond-haired, blue-eyed, Stepford-in-training run-ner-up — offers a refreshing perspec-tive on what it means to be American. She was not chosen, as critics have alleged, based on affirmative action, but on the competition’s true prerequi-sites — however shallow they may be. 
In the end, Fakih wowed the judges 
with a stock interview and bikini bod. That’s not to say bestowing national honors based on superficial attributes is a good thing, but — by design — the Miss USA pageant is one instance where politics and religion should take a backseat to stunning evening dresses — and, of course, legs for days.
—Margaret Y au
Contributing WriterAlthough this year’s Miss USA winner is the first Muslim or 
Lebanese-American to boast the crown — which may help shift per-ceptions of what the girl next door should like in the U.S — that victory means nothing inside a tradition as rigged and biased as a national pageant.
In Fakih’s defense, her resume is 
a far cry fr
om last year’s Miss USA 
winner, Kristen Dalton — a blue-
eyed blo
nde with nothing more than 
a North Carolina high-school diplo-ma to her name. Fakih, on the other hand, graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in eco-
nomics and business management, and has plans to attend law school in the future. 
But while 
Miss USA 2010 may be a more well-rounded baton-twirler than her predeces-sors, Fakih’s newfound 
fame still exists inside a superficial industry that emphasizes — above all else — the importance of light skin, meticulous hair and an anorexic bikini bod. 
Though her victory may have 
taken a small step toward reshaping the cookie-cutter ideal of American beauty, it only means so much on such firmly-planted pillars of sexism.

cial aid administration and campus libraries. 
However, a 2002 document from 
the UC Council on Student Fees — which consists of the chairs of the Council of Student Fees at each of the campuses — listed all these areas as inappropriate recipients of registration-fee funds. 
Van Esselstyn said the 
fee’s new flexibility is det-rimental to student life. 
“The registration fee 
is not supposed to be used for libraries or state-funded programs, ” Van Esselstyn said. “They’re separate from education fees for a reason, and stu-dents pay these fees so that it can come back to them in the form of ser-vices. ”
However, according to 
UC spokesperson Peter King, the reclassification of the fee will increase accountability for stu-dent-fee allocation as a whole. 
“It’s essentially a name change, 
but the change was motivated by a desire to remove any doubt about where the students’ registration fees were being spent, ” King said. “There had been some concern expressed by students and others that the monies generated were being applied to other purposes beyond student services. This clarifies they are not. ”
A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
agreed with King that the revision is a positive one. 
“From what I’ve heard, from 
UCSA and all sources, they say it’s j u s t  a  n a m e  c h a n g e  t o  m ak e  i t  m o r e  transparent, ” Ben Hassine said. “I would not support this if it paid for libraries or administrative services. ” 
The Student  Services Fee pol-
icy now requires each campus to maintain a website providing details on how registration fees are spent.  Additionally, chancellors for individual campuses are now required to annually solicit and consider stu-dent opinion on the amount of the fee; these recommendations will then be considered by the Council on Student Fees. 
“It’s a really good change, ” Ben 
Hassine said. “It increases transpar-ency as to where the student ser-vice fees are going, since students had been suspecting that it was used for other things. Also, changing the name to student service fee makes it more specific. ”
However, Van Esselstyn has main-
tained that the recent change allows administrators to expand the scope of the Student Services Fee, which  would contradict the purpose of hav-ing two separate fees — one for edu-cation and one for student services.
“Distinguishing these two fees 
has a purpose, ” Van Esselstyn said. “These fees were designed so that in these circumstances, when budget cuts occur, we still retain these stu-dent resources on campus. Because college isn’t just about education — it’s about the experience as well. This is blurring the distinction and taking out of two pockets instead of one. ” 
Van Esselstyn said an alternative 
to redirecting student-service funds would be to raise the education fee and lower the Student Services Fee so 
that the total amount would remain 
the same. 
Because the Student Services Fee 
can be considered a “new” fee, he said it is possible that previous documents ensuring the oversight of the registra-tion fee will now be ignored. 
“One of the tactical advantages 
of defining the fee with a new name is that the history of the fee under 
the old name becomes more difficult 
to associate with its current usage, ” Esselstyn said. 
Former Marshall College Council 
Senator and Registration Fee Advisory Committee member Brian McEuen said the new policy unfairly allows the university to funnel money away from the fee’s intended recipi-ents. 
The UCSD admin-
istration already has a history of drawing from the registration-fee fund for academic purposes. In an October 20, 2009 article, graduate student Garo Bournoutian said that over $1 million in student registration fees had been reallocated from student services to compensate for a lack of adequate academic funding. 
“Before, [the fee] 
couldn’t be used for curricular things, and anything to do with the educational mission, ” McEuen said. “It’s very shady that this is hap-pening, and it shouldn’t be happening. ”
The new Student Services Fee 
policy will go into effect beginning Fall Quarter 2010.

FIGHT CLUB
Demolishing $2,000 worth of electronic equipment 
isn’t normally a cause for celebration. But for the 25 students on UCSD’s Triton Robotix team — lead by Warren College sophomore Daniel Y an and Sixth college senior Allen Jiang, it’s all in a hard day’s work. 
After competing on the television show “Battle Bots” last 
April, Y ang and Jiang, a fourth year from Sixth College, hit the road with 12 other members of Robotix, a 120-pound robot and two three-pound mini robots. They drove to San Mateo, Calif., to compete in this year’s Robogames competition — an annual weekend showdown between robots from Canada, Puerto Rico and Brazil. At the end of the three-day battle, Robotix emerged fifth out of 21 competitors.
“We’re really excited to have been in the top 20 percent 
internationally, ” Jiang said.  
The club was started two years back as an outlet for stu-
dent engineers who wanted practical training at a university that, according to Y ang, is predominantly hands-off in its teaching methods.
“We have very few opportunities to try things, ” Y ang said. 
“We just study. This gives you a chance to experiment with things you learn; although a majority of it is that we like to engineer things, and we like to engineer things that destroy other things. ”
And on the destroying front, Kraken — Triton Robotix’s 
middle-weight-class robot — has been pretty successful. Between 10 club members, The metal droid took six to eight months to plan and build, spread over 12 in six-hour build sessions. 
“We started off with raw material and just built it up, ” Y ang 
said. “But not the electrical part, because we’re not electrical engineers. We buy the electrical components, but everything still had to be connected together. ”
According to Jiang, a surprisingly large chunk of the $2,000 
it took to build Kraken went to spare parts, which the team needs on hand in case of a malfunction. 
“The materials have to be strong and robust, ” Jiang said. 
“We have to buy extra motors and batteries in case they fail. ”
Going into the competition, Kraken’s battle strategy was 
to ram other robots into submission and immobilize them. Equipped with four-wheel drive and a linear actuator — a motor that controls the robot’s front shield, which is made out of abrasion-resistant steel — Kraken would be able to lower the shield under its opponents and then lift and immobilize them by running them into a wall.
“If you think of a game of rock, paper, scissors — we’re a 
rock robot; we’re built really solid, ” Y ang said. “We’re really tough and hard to destroy. Our goal is to ram them, break their weapon — then lift them and immobilize them. ”
The blueprint stages for Kraken began Week Three of Fall 
Quarter 2009. As the final model was completed a mere day before the April 22 competition, the team had only enough time for a few trial runs before Kraken’s first battle.
“Last year, we tested it at the competition, ” Y ang laughed. 
“We’re already doing better than last year. ”
Though they finished in the nick of time this year, the 
team still encountered a roadblock before the competition. For 
every four players traveling to the arena to participate, there 
needed to be one robot — or each additional person would

SHOWDOWN  IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, 
UCSD TRITON ROBOTIX IS GEARING UP 
FOR NEXT YEAR’S CAGE MATCH.FOCUS MONDAY , MAY 24, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 
UCSD alumna and Surf eCo founder Torrey Trust 
never planned to get rich quick. In fact, after graduat-ing with a major in visual arts and media from UCSD 
three years ago, Trust has yet to pursue a job within in her field of study. Instead, she has dedicated her time to saving the rainforest acre by acre and serving as the go-to girl for all of UCSD’s most surf-stupid students.
“Sometimes it’s not necessarily what you learn in the 
classroom that can make a difference in your future,” Trust said. 
While studying at UCSD, Trust worked as the recreation 
department’s first-ever female surf instructor. During that time, when the surf program was still in its infantile stages, she helped develop both an eight-week lesson plan and the all-female “Wahine” class that still exists today. 
Combining her experience at UCSD Recreation with a 
passion for sustainability, Trust founded Surf eCo in 2007. Based in Encinitas, the school integrates beach clean-ups and environmental lectures into its traditional surf lessons. Most of Trust’s classes outline how students can learn to be more aware of their carbon footprint while going about their daily lives. 
At the end of a session, participants receive goodie bags 
with biodegradable wax, reusable towels made from bamboo and green-tea sunscreen. 
“Starting Surf eCo was just my way of raising money and 
awareness about deforestation,” Trust said. “People can’t imagine that the things they do — like eating a hamburger or throwing away a plastic bag — can have such a negative effect on the environment.” 
Trust has taken it upon herself to ensure that eco-friendly 
practices are incorporated into all aspects of her business. She uses green surfboards, made from bio-foam planks wrapped in a thin layer of squishy, boogie-board-esque foam. She said her own Earth-friendly creativity has inspired her students to be aware of their environmental impact as well. 
“After the first week of lessons, everyone showed up with 
reusable water bottles and Trader Joe’s bags for wetsuits,” Trust said, laughing. “A year later, a mom told me that her son still bugged her to reuse plastic bags.” 
Trust credits her father — a fellow surfer and environ-
mental-science teacher for high schoolers — for instilling in her the urgent attention to sustainability. Recently, she said, he managed to raise $10,000 with his class toward prevent-ing tropical deforestation. However, it wasn’t until her own honeymoon in Costa Rica that Trust said she saw for herself what arboreal destruction really looked like. “Half of the trees had been cut down on over 50 acres [of 
the Osa Peninsula],” she said.
When she returned to California, inspired by her travels, 
Trust founded Surf eCo. In its first year, the company was so successful that Trust was able to pay back her startup costs and save approximately 75 acres through donations to the Nature Conservancy (a leading nonprofit organization that protects “ecologically important lands and waters”). According to Trust, most large-sum donors to the Nature Conservancy are over 65 years old — something she has been working to change.
Though it started with quite a bang in 2007, Surf eCo 
soon met several setbacks. According to Trust, a handful of members from the tight-knit Encinitas surf community have responded negatively to her surf lessons, believing that she intended to teach them at the popular surf break known as Swamis. In actuality, she said, the lessons ran further down the beach, where she has “never seen anyone surf — ever.” 
Then, in 2008, without any say from local surf schools, 
the Encinitas City Council made it illegal for surf lessons to run on the weekends. Within a few weeks, the most profit-able surf schools — the same ones who helped fund upkeep with beach-use fees — were the only companies allowed to continue holding weekend lessons. Surf eCo couldn’t com-pete. 
“I believe Surf eCo could have been an example to other 
surf companies of an environmentally friendly business model that was very successful,” Trust said. 
Trust said she still hopes to find an opportunity to teach 
larger surf companies how to be both profitable and eco-conscious. Even though she can no longer teach lessons in Encinitas, Trust has developed the first online surf school. For a small donation to the Nature Conservancy through her website, clients can view in-depth lesson plans and watch instructional videos. 
“I make sure to cover all the little things that most surf 
classes leave out,” Trust said. “Like rip currents or arching your back as you paddle.” 
Sitting in front of your laptop, it may seem like a strange 
way to learn to surf, but considering there are YouTube instructional videos on everything from hula-hoop dancing to pogo-hopping, Trust said she thinks there might just be a niche.

Every Friday night in Warren College, the bub-
bly voice of the ukulele can be heard drifting from the conference room of the Computer 
and Science Engineering Building — all thanks to a freshmen seminar taught by computer-science and engineering department chair Keith Marzullo.
MUS 87: Beginning Ukulele brought about 20 
students together for one day a week for a school-ing in the basics of the peaceful Hawaiian instru-ment. After Revelle College sophomore Vashisht Madabhushi took the seminar last year, he decided to create the UCSD Ukulele Club. Marzullo then helped Madabhushi connect with ot her ukulele enthusiasts 
on campus, and the group of about six students start-ed an official student organization last quarter
“The ukulele has been treated as more of a toy in 
the past, ” Marshall College sophomore David Chan said. “People are now seeing it as an instrument with a lot of original charm to it. ” 
The Ukulele Club meets Friday nights from 4 p.m. 
to 7 p.m. The first hour serves as an instruction ses-sion for new members and beginners, and the last two hours opens up for advanced players to jam together.
All beginners must first master “This Land Is Y our 
Land” before taking on Jason Mraz’ “I’m Y ours, ” John Mayer’s “Daughters” and Jay Sean’s “Down. ” 
At meetings, faculty and staff often play alongside 
the undergraduates. Chan said the club is open to anyone who likes playing ukulele or who wants to learn how to play. 
“The only requirement is that you are teachable 
and want to learn, ” Chan said.
He added that owning a ukulele is not required, 
although it is preferred: Currently, Marzullo — who serves as the club’s advisor — lends out a total of 5 ukuleles. According to Chan, a used ukulele costs anywhere from $50 to $500. Madabhushi, in charge of administrative duties for the club, said he is trying to get a hold of more additional models so that more new members can participate during meetings. 
Although there are no more performances 
planned, this year the Ukulele Club did perform for prospective students and their parents on Admit Day.
 “There is an organic growth to the club, ” Chan 
said. “I didn’t want this club to have a meeting agen-da. The Ukulele Club spends time relaxing by getting together, playing and teaching ukulele. ”

have to pay $35. Out of time and money, team members quickly scrapped together two three-pound mini-bots in three weeks. One of them, unfortunately, never made it to the competition, as it was still unfinished on competition day. The other was called Mini Triton. 
“It didn’t do too well in competition, 
but the fact that it drove was something, ” Yang  s ai d.
Taking inspiration from UCSD’s 
marine surroundings, Robotix decided to name all their fighting robots after sea creatures. Last year’s robot took on the moniker of Greek sea god Triton, and this year’s Kraken paid tribute to a large sea monster.
“We’re starting a theme of sea-creature 
named robots to honor UCSD, because we’re like — the ocean, or something, ” Yang  s ai d.
The weekend began and finished with 
bloodshed — specifically Y ang’s, as he cut himself twice trying to turn Kraken on and off.  The most exciting battle team Robotix fought in was against Dark Cyde — a robot that had a flipper.
After checking to make sure all were 
safe, and the arena doors were shut securely, the referee began a countdown. Kraken charged at the Dark Cyde, as the latter launched their weapon, missing twice. Robotix’s agile robot prevailed, managing to get underneath the oppos-ing robot to ram them repeatedly into the arena walls, damaging a battery and their frame weapon. 
“We would get around them get 
behind them and throw them into a wall, its really like ramming someone into a solid wall. ” Jiang said. 
Kraken emerged victorious in two out 
of the four frays it competed in. There were two ways for a robot to win at the Robogames —the first is to completely destroy your opponent’s machine, and the second is to immobilize it. If neither robot is incapacitated after three minutes, a panel of three judges named the winner. 
“We won normally by the judges’ deci-sion, ” Y ang said. “One judge was [from ‘Mythbusters’] —Grant Imahara — so 
that was pretty cool. ”
Between rounds, competitors are 
allowed to repair their robots. Fortunately for Robotix, Kraken’s damage remained fairly minimal: isolated to tears on its tires and a sizable dent in its shield from plow-ing opponents. 
“We were lucky we didn’t sustain 
much damage, ” Y ang said. “Some robots are other robots’ kryptonite. ”
Y ang said the team hoped that Kraken 
would be the Achilles heel for UCLA ’s robot. One month before the competition, Robotix challenged the UCLA team to a grudge match before the competition. 
“Daniel even drew a little UCLA robot 
on the top of our robot, and it was on fire, ” Jiang said. “We had designed it to withstand UCLA ’s robot, and it never hap-pened. UCLA didn’t bring their robot — it wasn’t finished yet. ”
As the last few weeks of Spring 
Quarter trickle away, the Robotix co-captains are already devising another ferocious robot to smash next year’s com-petition — this time, with weaponry. Jiang has even pitched a name for the improved bot: Crysomallon Squamiferum, a type of iron-armored sea snail. He said he expects the new machinery to cost more, but that he isn’t worried about finding spon-sors thanks to a mix of generous donors, including Expro, SolidWorks, Eplastics, Mutant Robots and Hiveports.com.
“ A lot of people are interested in 
having a very fast, hardcore spinning weapon, ” Jiang said. “I’m all for new ideas. Should be exciting. Each year we’re getting better at getting people and sponsors, so we can afford to take the [offensive]. ”
Y ang said he anticipated a similar 
upgrade to the Robotix representative in 2011.
“Next year, we’re going to build some-
thing really scary and destructive, ” Y ang said. “ At least, that’s my plan. ”

College students have been going to T ommy’ s since 1946 for the 
greatest burger in L.A., possibily the world. If  you haven’t been 
to Original T ommy’ s World Famous Hamburgers you’ re missing 
a big part of  the college experience.
7415 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. www.originaltommys.comGive Us the Old College Try . WORLD FAMOUS HAMBURGERS
If Plaza Cafe’s frightening excuse for beef gives 
you a food-poisoning hangover the size of Milwaukee, head to the corner of Prospect 
Street and Girard Avenue to satisfy your cow cravings. There’s a new burger joint in town: It’s called Smashburger and it’s the latest in a long line of Smashburgers known for their customizable options, cold beers and designer selection of savory meat.
With a minimalist aesthetic — as the shop is too 
cramped to be decorated — Smashburger’s ambi-ence screams high class In-N-Out. If it weren’t for the “smash” and “sizzle” boldly painted red on its nondescript walls, we would almost be dining in a dimly lit Abercrombie and Fitch.  
Smashburger’s clientele, however, quickly pulls 
us from the delusions of VIP dining. A Mecca for La Jolla families, the shop’s red polyester booths are usually crawling with whiney high-schoolers or 
snotty five-year-olds.
First impressions and 
callow clientele aside, Smashburger’s juicy patties never fail to hit the spot. By slamming and 
smashing the beef patties onto the grill, chefs keep all savory flavor locked inside, await release at first bite. The fact that it’s Angus Beef makes the experience even more divine — if only because of its reputation for off-the-charts fat con-tent.
When ordering, 
customers can either design their own burger or try one of Smashburger’s spe-cialties. If you need a fiery kick, try the 
Spicy Baja, topped with chipotle mayo and fresh, thick slices of jalapeno. Another top option is the San Diego Smashburger: a pile of fresh avocados and veggies, covered in pepper jack and slathered in sour cream. 
The Smashchicken is a healthier (yet still deli-
cious) choice, in which the chicken is literally smashed into a quarter-inch thick slice — making the flavor as concentrated as can be. Although side dishes are fairly pricey— an extra $2 to $3 with the purchase of a sandwich — most are hard to resist. The Smashfries, seasoned with olive oil, rosemary and garlic, taste exactly like Mom’s oven-roasted potatoes on Thanksgiving. But skip the haystack onions and fried pickles: Though the creamy dip-ping sauces that come with these sides are delicious, they do little to overpower an over-whelming salti-ness. And unless you like  your asparagus, carrots 
and green beans drenched in a shower of oil, pass on the veggie fries.
At the end of the day Smashburger is best known 
for its milkshakes, made from real Haagen-Dazs and served in tall ice cream glasses with whipped cream on top. The post-meal staple lets us fee like all we need on a Friday night is a jukebox and a maraschino cherry — a little taste of simpler times in a land of lavish modernities.

Se Habla Españolnationals for the 400-meter hurdles — 
this time, as the sixth seed with a time of 52.18 seconds.
After an exceptional season in 
which he won nearly every race he entered — including the CCAA title in the 110 and 400 hurdles — Baham said he is more than ready to compete at nationals. 
“I’m in the best shape of my life, I’m 
hurdling the best I ever have and I’m faster than I ever have been, ” Baham said. “I’ve taken care of myself, and we’ll just see what happens with my competitors when we get on the track. I like my odds though. ”
The returning national champion in 
the javelin throw — Felipe Ortiz of the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez — will not compete this year, which leaves the event wide open. UCSD sophomore Nick Howe is currently ranked third, and will look to capitalize on Ortiz’s absence after finishing seventh at the 2009 championship meet.
After battling injuries earlier this 
year, senior Daniel Anderson emerged to have a breakout season. He is ranked eigth for 800-meter race, but the top runners ten are all seperated by less than two seconds.
An experienced squad, eight of the 
thirteen Tritons travelling to Charlotte have competed in the national meet before.
“The level is quite high at the top 
end of Division-II, with athletes that have been on national teams and even Olympic teams, ” Salerno said. “Having been to the meet gives people a lot more confidence — and that they don’t just belong there, but they deserve to win. ”

ucsd.edu.is commonly called, is often so 
unpredictable that even the most competent football pundits hesitate to provide any firm predictions. While Group G earns the ominous distinction in this year’s tournament — featuring Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire and Portugal — Group D, which could be called the Mini Group of Death, features the venerable World Cup stalwarts Germany, a talent-packed Serbia, an exceed-ingly athletic Ghana (drawn into a difficult group for the second straight tournament) and a well-balanced Australia. With all four teams ranked in the world’s top 32, this group is the tournament’s most evenly balanced from top to bottom.
Germany
No. 6 Germany is the intuitive 
pick for the group’s winner, but its 
standing as favorite is tenuous. As evidenced by previous World Cup successes — and the litany of elite players now honing their trade at the European club level — Germany is a premier hotbed of footballing talent capable of producing iconic, tournament-defining players. However, German captain Michael Ballack’s devastating ankle injury — sustained while playing in the English Cup final on May 15 for London team Chelsea Football Club — has deprived the team of their talisman, and deprived the world of one of football’s most well-known and respected players.
Ballack’s injury is even more 
damning to a team whose chances of victory are balanced largely on the presence of strong veterans. While this year’s German selection does include a smattering of older players — defenders Philipp Lahm (age 26), Arne Freidrich (age 31) and striker Miroslav Klose (age 32) — at the core of the team are younger players with little expe-rience playing for the German national team, much less on a stage as grand as the World Cup. Manager Joachim Low will bank on the experience of the team’s few seasoned leaders to stabilize and harness the talent of unproven youngsters like midfielder Mesut Ozil and forwards Stefan Kiessling and Thomas Muller. However, while the absence of Ballack’s leadership will hurt, Germany still has a more talented roster than any other team in the group — giving the team a good chance not just to win Group D, but perhaps the entire tourna-ment. A deep run to the semifinals and beyond is well within question.
Serbia
While there is a substantial 
drop-off in quality between No. 16 
Serbia’s first team and its reserve players, it still fields a starting 11 perfectly capable of beating any opposition. They proved their com-petence during a surprisingly easy European qualification campaign, finishing ahead of group members France and Romania and boasting top-class talent in every depart-ment.
On defense, Nemanja Vidic and 
Branislav Ivanovic — two hard-hitting, dogged defenders who have garnered international acclaim for their exploits on English-league powerhouses Manchester United and Chelsea FC, respectively — form arguably one of the best defensive pairings in the world.
In the midfield, team captain 
Dejan Stankovic and Milos Krasic excel. The former, who just lifted the European Champions League Cup with club side Inter Milan on May 22, combines combative, ball-winning abilities with a wide passing range and a venomous shot from afar. Krasic, who flies under the international radar playing in the frozen tundra of Russia’s first division for CSKA Moscow, is a deadly hybrid of skill and speed. 
So, with an imposing defense 
and dynamic midfield, the Serbs obviously have what it takes to maintain form throughout the tour-nament. Four years ago, however, stocked with comparable talent, the team (competing as Serbia-Montenegro) lacked organization and team chemistry, making head-lines with the 6–0 annihilation it suffered at the hands of a merciless Argentina.
If the Serbians are to improve 
upon that performance, they must avoid injury. Unlike the Germans, — who will likely replace Ballack with little impact to their on-field ability — the Serbians don’t have the luxury of an endless roster of talent. Should they fall at all short of their potential, they will have major problems with the likes of No. 20 Australia and No. 32 Ghana — whose African support base will likely make every stadium a living hell for any Black Star opposition. 
Ghana
The Black Stars of Ghana, 
despite an inferior pre-tournament 
ranking, are not to be taken lightly. Inter Milan’s Sulley Muntari and Chelsea FC’s Michael Essien are two of the finest central midfielders in the world. Their lethal combina-tion of power, skill, speed, stamina and mental fortitude is unrivaled, and both play pivotal roles on their respective club teams.
Big names aside, when the 
Ghanaians made their improbable march into the round of 16 from a similarly difficult group four years ago, their play was not dependant on their superstars; rather, on a physically imposing, energetic, up-tempo style of football with which opposition teams struggled to cope. Because the intensity of this already overwhelming style will be enhanced by a raucous African crowd in the stands, not only could Ghana propel into the knockout rounds, but they could very well claim top group honors.
Australia
Lastly, the Socceroos — the fans 
affectionate name for the team — are 
no slouches. The team may not boast any international superstars, but its complexion is very similar to that of the U.S.: The team features a smat-tering of European-based players, headlined by standout forward Tim Cahill and defender Lucas Neill. 
In 2006, the Socceroos advanced 
past the group phase to battle eventual champion Italy in a 0-0 stalemate over 90 minutes. It stands as of one of the most controversial moments of the last World Cup: A questionable call inside the penalty area with mere seconds left doomed the Aussies to a heartbreaking extra-time loss. With many players from that team returning this year, the Socceroos will have retribution on their mind entering group play. However, given the equally powerful motivations and superior ability of their group opponents, the Aussies will most likely impact the group as a spoiler rather than a group leader.
The Verdict
Ultimately, the Germans have 
too much World Cup pedigree and 
raw talent not to advance out of the group. Maybe. However, the team that joins them in the knockout rounds will be determined by the winner of Serbia vs. Ghana on June 13 — a matchup that promises to be one of the best of the group phase. Maybe.
The only thing I can really pre-
dict with any great is that there’s only way to make watching Group D any better than it already prom-ises to be: Watch it with a beer in hand.

TRACK & FIELD — The best athletes — the UCSD track and field 
team has to offer know the stakes for their final meet of the season. 
With one quality race, throw or jump, any one of them could return to campus a national champion, and be immortalized in the Triton history books forever.  
From May 27 to May 29, UCSD will be represented by 13 athletes 
— nine women and four men — at the 2010 NCAA Division-II Track and Field Championships held at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, N.C. One of the top programs in the nation, UCSD have several athletes poised to take national titles, including two with the top ranking in their respective events.
“What I like about this group is that most of them are ranked in the 
top 10 in their event, ” head coach Tony Salerno said. “ At this level, any-body who is ranked in the top five or so is right there — so that leaves us pretty excited. ” 
Fresh off her second consecutive Athlete of the Meet award at the 
CCAA championships last week, senior Christine Merrill will compete in four events in Charlotte. Along with defending her national title in the 400-meter hurdles, Merrill will run the 100-meter hurdles and both the 4x100 and 4x400 relays. This will be Merrill’s fourth straight trip to the D-II national championships. 
Junior Kelly Fogarty — who will join Merrill on the relay teams — is 
similarly slated to compete in four events for the Tritons. Fogarty will enter the championships ranked ninth in both the 100- and 200-meter races, having set school records of 11.74 seconds and 23.97 seconds in the events, respictively, earlier this season. 
 Senior Linda Rainwater was scratched from the heptathlon lineup due to injury, but is still scheduled to compete as the top seed in the high jump. Rainwater worked through the pain of a fractured back to  win conference in the high jump last week. Though she is the defending national champion in the event, Rainwater’s medical clearance will not be certain until just before she leaves for Charlotte. 
“If we knew at the time, we would have pulled her; and by the end 
of the event she needed help off the mat after each jump, ” Salerno said. “But she was able to get up and wind it up again, and she got the jump she needed to win. Y ou hear about tough athletes — this was really impressive. ”
Even in Rainwater’s absence, UCSD will not be short on talent in 
the heptathlon. Junior Stephanie LeFever won the conference title in the event. LeFever is also entered in the long jump and 4x400 meter relay, part of her impressive nine-event schedule in Charlotte.  
Sophomore Jacqueline Rose and freshman Kathleen Hitchens will 
join Merrill and Fogarty on the 4x100 team; Rose will also run on the 4x400 team. The squads are ranked ninth and sixth, respectively. 
Junior Theresa Richards and senior Marie Archer will represent 
UCSD in the throwing events, with Richards ranked seventh in the jav-elin throw and Archer ranked 15th in the hammer throw. Senior Donna LeFever will arrive ranked No. 10 in the pole vault. 
On the men’s side, senior Casey Ryan leads the team as UCSD’s other 
top-ranked athlete. Already the school record holder in the event, Ryan holds the national lead by nearly three inches; at 7’3.25” .
Fellow senior Leon Baham is making his second straight trip to It’s no secret, really: The magic, drama and intrigue of the FIFA World Cup is at its pinnacle 
during the tournament’s two-week, high-octane knockout round. Having weathered their respective groups, the remaining 16 nations go to battle 
in emotionally charged, single-elimi-
nation fixtures — until one (and only one) nation immortalizes itself in the pages of history. And, of course, in the hearts and minds of adoring (or bitterly resentful) fans.
When the field of 32 competing 
nations is drawn, lottery-style, into eight groups for the two-week group phase of the monthlong tourna-ment, two frontrunners can usually be inferred. Certain countries have proven themselves time and time again throughout the tournament’s history to be worthy contenders in the final fortnight. Even the most soccer-apathetic of individuals are familiar with World Cup usuals Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy and France. These squads  are all safe bets for deep runs into the tournament’s latter stages, and can be penned in as the winners of their respective groups before a ball is even kicked.
However, at each quadren-
nial competition, the lottery draw arbitrarily warps the fortunes of a few nations — randomly casting four quality teams into a group and effectively creating the World Cup equivalent of a four-way heavyweight free-for-all. As only two of these four juggernauts are allowed to advance to the legend-defining knockout rounds, the group is typically full of tense, evenly fought tussles — an emotional rollercoaster for fans of the participating teams, and a mouth-watering spectacle for neutral bystanders.

CREW FINISHES STRONG AT GOLD RIVER
By Liam Rose
Associate Sports Editor
WOMEN’S CREW — They may have been up 
against top competition in their final race on 
Saturday — with little chance of earning a place in the National Division-II rowing champion-ships  —   but the UCSD women’s crew team still managed to turn in its fastest performance of the year.
At the Pacific Coast Rowing Championships 
on May 15, the Tritons faced an elite lineup of teams, but still came home with 26 medals among 24 members of the varsity and novice squads. 
The varsity eight-boat came in at 7:22.8, 
recording its best time of the season. Competitors included Western Washington University, the five-time defending NCAA D-II National Champions. Though WWU broke to the front at the start of the race, the Tritons trailed close behind and showed good finishing speed in the last 500 of the 2000 meters.
“They had a terrific race and finished the 
season beautifully, ” head coach Patti Pinkerton said. “I think we got all the speed we could get and executed our race very well. Maybe it sounds trite, but when it comes together like that, it’s just magical. ” 
The varsity eight has dropped its time more 
than 20 seconds since the start of the year. 
On Saturday, the boat was led by captains 
senior Jesi Bennett and junior Denise Kleckner and powered by seniors Lynn Nguyen, Wanda Chin, Summer Austin and Jaime Bigwood, as well as junior Megan Simmons and freshman Courtney Escajeda. Junior Katrina Paz served as coxswain.
The varsity four-boat also held its own at 
the season-ending tournament, coming in third behind two boats from WWU. The varsity light-
weight four took home one of two Triton golds 
that day, topping University of Oregon by several boat lengths. Senior Brianna Patterson rowed in the stroke position for both boats, wrapping up her Triton career with two medal-winning per-formances.  
The novice four earned a third-place medal 
in the race, coming in behind D-I competitors UCLA and St. Mary’s University. 
Austin finished her senior year by winning the 
Collegiate Single Skull — a single-person race — followed by sophomore teammate Carolyn Belak.    
For a squad that lacked experience at the 
beginning of the season, Pinkerton said the 
Tritons quickly learned to gel as team. 
“We have a lot of young rowers, so we’ve 
been working hard to get everyone on the same 
page, ” Pinkerton said. “Y ou will always have some athletes that are better than others, but as long as everyone works as hard as they can, it’s going to come together — and we really did that. ”
Because most of the team will be returning 
next year, Pinkerton said she is optimistic that the Tritons will continue to improve next season.
“In order to get back to the national champi-
onships, we will need to drop another 20 seconds next season, and get down to about seven min-utes, ” Pinkerton said. “Before, it was just theoreti-cal; but now, the team believes that it’s possible. ”
