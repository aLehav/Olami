Event planners are limited by 
security concerns, as discussed at the festival’s first open forum of the year.Council Racks Up Fall Quarter Absences
By Megha Ram
Contributing Writer
Several members of A.S. Council 
may face impeachment, if their atten-
dance records at Wednesday-night council meetings do not improve.   According to the organization’s atten-dance policy, each member is allowed up to three absences per year. 
If a member 
accrues more than three absences, he or she is eligible to be nominated for impeachment. This policy is usually enforced by the A.S. advocate general, a position which was vacant during Fall Quarter 2009. 
However, new 
A.S. Advocate General Parminder Sandhu — appointed by the A.S. Council the first meeting of Winter Quarter — said he will begin the impeachment pro-cess for any mem-bers currently over the allowable limit if they receive addi-tional absences. 
The impeach-
ment process begins when the advocate general submits an article of impeach-ment to congress. If two-thirds of the council votes to pass 
the article, it will be filed with the A.S. Judicial Board, which will then make the ruling. 
“I feel the number of absences has 
been an impediment, ” said Sandhu. “If you’re not at meetings, it’s hard to do business. ”
Seven voting members on the 
council have three or more absences, and will face impeachment if they receive any more. These members include Biological Sciences Senator John Ehrhart (7.5 absences), Sixth College Senator John Condello (5.5 absences) and Thurgood Marshall College Senator Brian McEuen (4.5 absences).
Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund and Muir College Senator Ryan O’Rear have all accrued 3.5 absences, and Campuswide Senator Carli Thomas has three. 
One-half of an absence indicates 
that the councilmember stayed for only part of the meeting.

At the first Sun God forum of the year, councilmem-
bers complained that they were limited by security regula-tions. Two years after the administration pressured A.S. Concerts and Events into instituting a complete makeover of the annual Sun God Festival — tightening security and confining the festival to RIMAC Field — councilmembers are still trying to live up to A.S. President Utsav Gupta’s famous campaign promise to “uncage Sun God” . 
Core members of A.S. Concerts and Events met with 
interested students at the first Sun God Festival 2010 Open Forum, held on Jan. 15, to discuss plans for this year’s concert format.
The majority of the two-hour town-hall meeting 
focused on the inefficient entrance policy and the dimin-ished role of student organizations at the 2009 festival — as well as the possible inclusion of a Bear Garden in 2010.

ON?All Revelle College junior Thomas Dadourian needs for his new show — “Will It Chop” — is a 
samurai sword. 
But Student-Run Television, 
which is scheduled to resume programming on Channel 18 this week, will need more than that to overcome a tumultu-
ous history and regain campus recognition. 
Dadourian 
and Warren College senior Ali Hadian are the station’s new general manag-ers — installed 
by the A.S. Council last quarter to launch a rebranded version of SRTV , after controversial content brought UCSD national media attention in 2005.
In February of that year, for-
mer Koala  Editor in Chief Steve 
Y ork broadcast a homemade video of himself having sex with an adult-film actress. Following a debate that weighed the pres-ervation of freedom of student speech alongside concerns over tarnishing the image of UCSD, A.S. councilmembers caved under administrative pressure to regulate SRTV’s material. The council passed a bill to ban pornographic images, the broadcasting of “Koala TV” and Y ork from the station.
On Nov. 3, 2005, after pro-
grammers aired an interview featuring Y ork, the A.S. Council voted to shut down SRTV . Four days later, then-acting Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff refused a request to reactivate the sta-tion’s signal. 
The student body attempted 
to vote against the prohibition of sexual content in a January 2006 campuswide special elec-tion, but administrators ignored the vote and were still able to

Despite a 2.3-percent 
increase in applicants, UCSD 
will enroll fewer applicants for Fall Quarter 2010. 
Overall, a record 134,029 
students applied for admission to one of the 10 UC undergrad-uate campuses — a 5.8-percent increase from last year’s 126,701. Freshman applicants increased 2.4 percent, from 98,002 to 100, 320. In addition, transfer stu-dent applications rose to 33,389 from last year’s 28,699 — a 17.5-percent increase. 
UCSD saw growth in its 
applicant pool as well. The number of freshman applicants increased 2.3 percent — from 47,708 to this year’s 48,073 — while transfer applications shot up from 11,428 to 14,286 this year, a substantial 27.9-percent jump.
The racial breakdown-sof applicants also shifted. American-Indian applicants increased 25.1 percent from 257 to 324, while the number of black applicants increased by 20.6 percent from 1,612 to 1,968. Mexican-American appli-cations increased 5.8 percent, from 7,754 to 8.269. 
According to UC Director of 
Admissions and Ethnic Media Communications Ricardo Vazquez, applicant growth in the UC system was the main goal of new eligibility require-ments approved by the Board of UC Regents last year, which will go into effect Fall Quarter 2012. These requirements — proposed in Fall 2008 and approved Feb. 5, 2009 — expand the requisites to be considered for freshman admission. All California stu-dents who complete 11, instead of the original 15, of the univer-sity’s required college-prepara-tion courses, may be considered. The minimum unweighted GPA has been lowered from 3.0 to 2.8, and the SAT II is no longer a requirement for eligibility. 
In contrast to the passing  of 
the relaxed applicant process, the regents agreed upon a plan last January to reduce freshman enrollment by 2,000 overall, due to state budgetary cuts. 
According to Vazquez, the 
UC system reduced its typical incoming class by 2,300 fresh-men last year. However, an addi-tional 500 community-college transfers were enrolled when compared to the 2007-08 sta-tistics. 
Vazquez said the university 
has recently focused on enroll-ing more transfers.  
“UC is really about the busi-
ness of opportunity, ” Vazquez said. “Transfer is a cost-effective option for many students, and UCOP and the regents think it’s important to keep the door open for them. ” 
He added that the university 
was still able to offer a place for every eligible student last year, but that enrollment may again decrease for the upcoming year.  
Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Admissions Mae Brown said no enrollment target has been finalized.
“We are in the process of 
finalizing the Fall [Quarter] 2010 undergraduate enrollment targets, ” Brown said. “However, I think that we will continue to see a decrease in the number of freshmen and a slight increase in the number of transfer stu-dents. ”
Brown expects the admit 
rate for Fall Quarter 2010 to decrease.  
“We recognize that due 
to the reduction in freshman enrollment, we will disappoint many well-qualified students, ” Brown said.

AVP Concerts and Events Alex 
Bramwell said he is reevaluating the 
entrance policy — the issue that received the most attention at the forum. At last year’s festival, 19,000 students waited in line for up to four hours on the day of the event to receive their wristbands, due to unstrategic buildup of frantic students.
“Last year, there were about 1,000 
student wristbands that we didn’t give out, ” Bramwell said. “If people came at 1 p.m. in the afternoon, they got their wristbands immediately. But some people waited for two hours because they were afraid we would run out. ”
Campus Events Manager Alex 
Kushner said an ideal entry policy would be where students could go straight from class to the festival with-out waiting in long lines. In 2008, stu-dents could pick up wristbands in the week leading up to Sun God, but A.S.  Council ran out before the concert.
“T h e  b i g g e s t  f e a r  w e  h a v e  i s  t h a t  
we give out wristbands during the week, and then people don’t show up for the event, ” Kushner said.
One student at the forum sug-
gested that A.S. Council set up a wristband tracker on Facebook, so that people could log on the day of the festival and see how many tickets were still available.
In addition to entrance logistics, 
forum attendees discussed the declin-ing role of student organizations ever since the festival was first confined to RIMAC Field in 2008. Last year, only four student orgs set up booths.
Bramwell said that A.S. Concerts 
and Events is looking into making the booths — which were moved to the west end of RIMAC Field last year — free for student orgs as an incentive.
Kushner noted that, as evidenced by 
last year’s festival, it is difficult for stu-dent orgs to generate competitive  inter-est with the festival’s large-scale activi-ties, like an inflatable obstacle course, a rock climbing wall and a dance tent.
“For the past 28 years, student 
organizations have been able to come up with something cool to attract stu-dents, ” Kushner said. “But when there are 10,000 people heading over to the dance tent, it’s hard to compete. ”
However, according to Gupta, this 
year’s Sun God will incorporate stu-dent organizations by allowing the setup of booths outside of RIMAC Field, on Library Walk.
Last year’s event marked the second 
Sun God Festival enclosed entirely by RIMAC Field. According to Bramwell, 
the A.S. Council is open to fielding events such as a Bear Garden in other locations on campus, but pressure from the administration to maximize security makes these activities unre-alistic — despite campaign promises from Gupta to “uncage” the festival.
“Not having the feeling of Sun God 
on campus has been the No. 1 com-plaint, ” Bramwell said. “But having people wandering around in a free-for-all is what we’re trying to avoid. ”
According to Gupta, this year’s Sun 
God will actually be more of a campus-wide event, with student orgs and col-lege councils adding their own events.
“We’re not going to be able to 
bring back the smaller daytime con-certs [in Price Center], ” Gupta said. “But  in terms of the rest of it, like booths on Library Walk, we’re bring-ing those back. ”
Kushner expressed doubts about 
the ability to of orgs to handle the large crowds that turn out for the festival.
“We’re not in the business of pre-
venting people from doing what they want, ” he said. “But ... can student orgs weather the storm of [a Sun God-sized] onslaught?”

According to A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta, the A.S. Constitution does not allow for associate vice presidents to be impeached. He said they can only be removed by a resolution calling for an AVP’s removal.
Sandhu said he begin the impeach-

endless-summer perk of which only the ballsiest take advantage: the right to bare arms, legs and paper-white backsides down at Black’s Beach. 
Stashing your inhibitions (and 
underwear) behind one of the more distant boulders along the shore is an important first step toward ulti-mate seaside liberation. From there, whether the end goal is to rid your-self of farmer’s tan or merely feel nature’s breath graze your lower half, there are certain practical measures even the most free-spirited among us would do well to follow. 
First: Even if you think you’re 
confident enough to shed your shorts solo, no nude beach novice should tread the pube-littered shore alone.
The grandpas in ponytails who 
frequent Black’s may well be harm-less, but you’ll attract a few less uncomfortable lingering gazes with the safety of a friend’s hand in your own. And on the off-chance that a lab partner or other unfortunate acquaintance happens to be strolling the beach fully-clothed during your inaugural free-for-all, seeing that you’re not alone might minimize the shock (or joy) of learning that your curtains do, in fact, match the drapes.
Sunglasses might seem an unnec-
essary addition, given your other-wise accessory-free ensemble, but don’t undervalue the importance of shielding your eyes from UV rays (and flirty widowers alike). The darker the lens, the smaller the like-lihood of provoking bedroom eyes from lonely granddaddies.
The shades, however, should be 
your sole accessory. No matter how unkind the combined forces of gravi-tational pull and the coastal breeze on your exposed winter flesh, the chief objective is to let loose. Though a number of casual beach-strollers bear sports bras or metal cock rings to combat the inevitable flopping factor, such precautions counter the carefree mentality implicit to nudist cardio.
Heading down to the beach just 
before dusk should spare you the sight of toasty sixtysomethings tan-ning face down and leathery back-side up. It’s also ideal if you’re look-ing to save a little sunscreen; going at high noon will require expending a little extra SPF on a few usually con-cealed  crevices. 
If there’s one thing the Guru has 
learned outside this spiritless higher-education bubble, it’s that  with all 
the restrictive vestiges of the morn-
ing’s outfit left carelessly behind, 
there’s no pleasure quite like skip-ping lecture to watch an explosive sunset along the shore — just make 
sure you track down your pants before nightfall. The trek back up to the parking lot is bleak enough already.

ON CAMPUS —  After a year of nothing but 
static — interrupted by five lonely installments of 
“Koala TV” from the Joose-scattered Student-Run 
Television office — a team of film enthusiasts are 
forging their way back onto the airwaves this week. They may be momentarily buzzed on the grand-reopening vibes and one long winter break’s worth of pipe dreams, but the SRTV crew will need a ballsier, more diverse staff to become the campus powerhouse it has the potential to be. 
Prior to this week’s relaunch, the A.S. Council — 
which funds SRTV like a student organization, with student fees —  decided that the SRTV production 
staff should be held accountable for the past year of crackly screen snowstorms. A.S. President Utsav Gupta and a small board of fellow councilmembers re-opened the managerial positions at SRTV . They interviewed standing general managers Ali Hadian and Thomas Dadourian — yes, the same winning duo under whom SRTV has stagnated all this time — and a handful of new applicants.
In the end, they decided to rehire Hadian and 
Dadourian. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the channel is destined to fail. Three years after moving to a different filming area and receiving double its budget from A.S. Council, SRTV finally has the high quality equipment necessary to offer more than the occasional hour of “Koala TV . ”
Beginning next week, the A.S. service is set to air 
“Will It Chop?” — based on thrash-happy Internet sensation “Will It Blend?” — and “Cooking with Dr. D,” a show on cooking to de-stress. While that’s a good (if ridiculously dorky) start, SRTV must strive to be a realistic reflection of the college demographic and their entertainment desires.
Even if they’re not filming it themselves, the 
managers’ goal should be to air material that draws in as many student viewers and contributors as pos-sible — and not everyone wants to see if a keyboard can be hacked in half with a Japanese sword. Or at least not more than three times: Lord knows our campus channels have a tendency to loop.
It takes more than some awkward Price Center 
flyers to recruit the kind of talent necessary to boost the station’s output in quantity and quality. (With only 11 members listed on its Web site, the staff isn’t

No matter who is responsible for funding yet another public-awareness tobacco-kills 
campaign, both should be aware they’ll have to get damn crafty to earn a second glance. 
Although tobacco giants have been convicted 
of hiding the dangers of their product for decades, the days of workplace ashtrays and high-school smoke pits are well behind us, and it’s not much of a secret anymore that smoking kills. The token foreboding image of an old woman sliding a ciga-rette into the circular cut-out in her throat has lost most of its shock value, and there’ve been enough viral campaigns and prohibitive state laws to ensure no one’s in the dark. 
Targeting young, impressionable children and 
adolescents through television advertisements and public school programs may well still be worth the effort. But at the end of the day, a campaign’s only as good as its audience is receptive — and the con-tinued popularity of cigarettes suggests we’re not as open-eared as the government might like. 
— Trevor Cox 
Opinion Editor<WJIKKW1VL][\Za4I_[]Q\
A 2006 District of Columbia court case ruled that cigarette companies were guilty of hid-
ing their product’s dangers, and that they had to publicize those effects in the media. The industry is now appealing the decision. 
But several courts have upheld the original rul-
ing, and there’s a slim chance the Supreme Court will rule differently. 
Lawyers representing the tobacco industry 
are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Their choices? Either settle in court and report the dan-gers of their clients’ deadly products or continue fighting the government, take their case to the Supreme Court and possibly lose billions. Industry lawyers have hinted they may stop fighting.
Good call. Everyone’s most hated suits would be devas-
tated if they lost the case and had to shell out $200 billion to the government — but that wouldn’t necessarily make anyone more aware of the dan-gers of tobacco. 
Cigarette companies are among the most vili-
fied of businesses, but they’re still an industry (almost) like any other; they provide invaluable jobs and livelihoods. Cigarette corporations should certainly own up to past failures, but for the industry today to take such a huge blow for mistakes made half a century ago would be unfairly damaging to all those who now rely on our tobacco addiction to make a living.

Industries that cheat consumers out of their money 
are common — we do live in America, after all. 
But those which have historically swindled millions of buyers out of their lives shouldn’t get off the hook without appropriate financial retribution. 
Despite the fact that tobacco companies have been 
supplying people with jobs, the history of false adver-tisements on which the entire industry thrives justifies a government-catalyzed setback. 
The economy may be in shambles, but we should 
still hang onto some scrap of human dignity, and realize that tobacco breadwinners are about as inno-cent and deserving of their profits as a crack-dealing neighbor who sells to anyone and everyone. It’s about time these fat cats hung their heads, reached into their pockets and humbly funded a government-sponsored anti-smoking campaign. And they better like it.

Senior Staff WriterOPINION TUESDAY , JANUARY 19, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 
Dear Editor,
As reported in the Jan. 14 
article “Haitian Capital Hit Hard 
by Quake, ” a resolution proposing a $5,000 donation by the A.S. Council to fund relief efforts in poverty-stricken and devastated Haiti failed to pass. This was not because the A.S. Council did not have the money, but because the majority of the governing body thought it would create a dangerous prece-dence that would overturn standing rules on giving student fees and funds to a country so desperately in need of such aid. 
The council debated the issue 
for a little over an hour, quib-bling about whether giving such an amount of money was within the council’s rules. What appalled me the most was that my fellow councilmembers, educated and knowledgeable representatives who decide on and know the student body’s best interests, could sit there and argue over giving immedi-ate aid to alleviate the suffering of their brothers and sisters in Haiti. Imagine if members of Congress quibbled over the legality of giving federal money to fund relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, only to issue a press release stating that they stand in solidarity with the victims of the hurricane. 
If members of the council were 
keen on actually representing the student body’s best interests, they would have approved the resolution without hesitation, as opposed to merely standing in solidarity with the victims of the earthquake. Quite simply, my fellow councilmembers failed to take into account the brev-ity of the situation in Haiti. With over 50,000 people dead in a coun-try essentially forsaken by most developed countries, my fellow councilmembers failed to take into account the human factor. They had the power to amend such standing rules, but they felt that violating the rules was a much more serious and pressing issue than sending the best form of aid available to a country reeling from the aftershocks of the earthquake and extreme poverty. 
It begs the question, where are 
the council’s priorities? Certainly not in alleviating the suffering of Haiti’s denizens. Such a disconnect from the tragedy and horrors of a natural disaster only reveals the council’s callousness and lack of concern for anything that is per-ceived as not germane to student affairs at UCSD. 
I understand that rules and laws 
must be followed in order to estab-lish precedence and prevent chaos from reigning. But such man-made laws must be disobeyed in order to adhere to the higher law command-ing us to be our brother’s keeper, to be responsible for securing the gen-eral welfare of all — especially those in dire need. Never have I seen such a casual disregard for the welfare of one’s fellow human. It seems that Haiti has already been forsaken and forgotten by the Associated Students of UCSD.
— Victor Lin
A.S. Physical Sciences Senatorlarge enough now  to take on much 
more than a weekly cooking show and destruction-fest — and those too may slip from priority).
SRTV could create an internship 
program to recruit visual-arts  and 
film students to join its crew. In such a competitive job market, no one can have too much experience; an internship program (the less paid, the better!) could attract a slew of applicants. 
Another first step SRTV must 
take is to streamline its Web site. With links to a two-year-old forum, a schedule with no listings and a mem-ber roster from early 2008, it’s far 
from user-friendly. SRTV could take some tips from UC Berkeley’s CalTV Web site, which features both a weekly updated schedule and instant access to the station’s latest videos.
Once SRTV debuts, posting its 
shows to the Internet would  allow 
students t o
 tune in more often, con-
sidering its current low profile.
CalTV also covers daily investiga-
tive news, sports, comedy and music. Even better, UCLA airs Dorm Life, a massively popular channel that covers everything from hyperactive RAs to the weird theater kids down the hall.
No one’s expecting SRTV to leap 
such great telecasting strides over-night, but inspiring outside student involvement could be the key to the creative floodgates. SRTV could also take some lessons from our own individual colleges’ TV channels: Marshall’s TMTV , Eleanor Roosevelt College’s ERCTV and Revelle’s 
RCTV  are making themselves vis-
ible by postin
g on Y ouTube, vetting 
Facebook groups  and updating a 
Twitter feed.
It may be tempting to write off 
the latest Channel 18 relaunch as superficial after the A.S. Council rehired the same guys who couldn’t manage to air a thing for a year and half. But let’s make this for the stu-dents, by the students — not just a few kids with expensive cameras.

broadcast signal because the university owns 
the Triton Cable Network, which transmits SRTV programming.
Ratcliff and then-Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W . Watson wanted to employ a review board to evaluate content before it aired, and wanted the station’s charter to ban “graphic depictions of sexual nudity. ” 
When the A.S. Council did not include 
Ratcliff and Watson’s demands in their charter, the university released its own “acceptable use policy” in October 2006.
Prior to that, SRTV had been allowed to 
come back on air in June 2006 under certain restrictions: The station could only broadcast between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. That’s when Hadian joined the SRTV crew. 
“The station itself was very outdated, ” he 
said. “ As far as SRTV itself went, there wasn’t much going on. It was pretty defunct. ”
Hadian moved into a managing position 
after SRTV set up shop in a new Student Center studio and upgraded to new equipment. 
“We got a brand-new space, but we had a lot 
of problems, ” he said. “For the first two years of managing, there were a lot of obstacles in set-ting up the station and getting operational. ”
Since then, the station has been shuffling 
along with the help of the Koala , whose mem-
bers helped set up the studio and provided the station’s only content last year — in the form of a late-night talk show, on which hosts often got drunk and removed items of clothing while answering calls from around campus.
“They were filming their own shows, which 
did push [the] envelope as far as acceptable content [goes], ” said Hadian, now in his sec-ond year as manager. “That upset [the A.S. Council], because we felt we were going in a backwards manner … SRTV is not supposed to show that in the first place. ”In October 2009, Gupta decided to moti-
vate the production process by exercising effective regulation, and put SRTV under the council’s control. In the past, SRTV acted as a student organization funded by student fees; now, it is considered an A.S. Council service.  Gupta said that a new policy will ensure all content be under council jurisdiction, and will require all programming to be filtered through principal members of SRTV .
So Gupta opened the application process to 
hire new leadership, and held a series of inter-views with aspiring station managers.
In the past, outgoing SRTV staff members 
made recommendations to the A.S. Council on who they wanted to be general manager.
According to AVP Student Services 
Meredith Madnick, the council also met with prospective applicants face to face, outside of the formal interview, and made their expecta-tions of the station’s management clear. 
“We’re now making SRTV not simply a 
venue where students can produce content, but it is actually an entity that is responsible for creating content, ” VP Finance Peter Benesch said. “It’s actually not just a place where people who are bored and want to make a show go, it’s a place where you go if you want to become part of SRTV and be responsible for producing content … It’s a pretty big shift from what it [was] before. ”
According to Madnick, council members 
made these managerial changes because they wanted to prevent possible injury to the sta-tion’s facilities and reputation, and reinstate SRTV’s previous recognition around campus.
Out of the five applicants, Hadian was 
chosen as a manager because of his familiar-ity with SRTV , and Dadourian because of his background in professional production.
“ Ali is a very good station manager because 
of all the specialized knowledge he had in terms of what it literally takes to put on pro-grams and how to run a station, ” Benesch said. 
Dadourian has worked as an actor, a 
production assistant and an office intern for Oscar-winning film producer Scott Rudin. Dadourian was also enrolled in a summer seminar at the USC School of Cinematic Arts and is a member of the Screen Actors Guild.
Though he was also a principal member of 
SRTV last year, Dadourian said he felt hesitant to become more involved.
“ As a member, I didn’t really know that 
much about SRTV , and was just hesitant to get involved [because] stuff was poorly organized. It wasn’t an inspiring place to be involved, ” said Dadourian. “Most of the members were from the Koala , and I didn’t like how they do film 
productions. ”
So when Gupta opened up the managing 
position again last quarter — under the pre-tense that the station would be more heavily regulated by the A.S. Council — Dadourian was quick to apply.
“That’s when I kind of decided that I’m not 
going to sit around and be a follower, ” he said. “I really wanted to help people to get things going and bring a more professional side to SRTV . ”
In his new position, Dadourian said that he 
feels a greater power to push things along.
“ As general manager, I feel like I have the 
responsibility now to make sure that stuff hap-pens. I really enjoy being able to get things going because when I was a member, I took a more observational role and wasn’t able to organize stuff. ”
Madnick said she and the two managers 
will regularly keep in touch, and content-approval forms will be used to regulate the shows before they air.
Warren College senior Shane Grant, who 
has been working as an SRTV technical direc-tor for three years, thinks the two-pronged management system (Hadian and Dadourian) is better than having one manager.“It’s a bit better actually. If you only have one 
person in charge and you can’t get in touch with that one person, then things get stalled, ” he said. “But with two people in charge, you can split the responsibility. I guess it can get a little bit more hectic, but I think we’re pretty organized. ”
However, current members of radical 
humor newspaper the Koala  — a student 
organization that has been airing its content on SRTV since the ’80s — have expressed disap-pointment with the new system.
“I don’t really agree with the whole co-
manager position that they’ve assigned. I think it creates a dichotomy [where] they can’t do as well as they could, but they’re making a good effort and they’re making good plans, ” associate Koala  editor Wes Field said. “I don’t agree with 
the ideas of going ‘Hollywood’ and getting paid and getting advertisement — but I don’t know if that’s the whole purpose of SRTV . I think it’s about entertainment. ”
Dadourian said he plans on establishing 
SRTV as a respected media outlet for all facets of student life, from academics to social activi-ties around campus.
“I want to take away the prejudice about 
how ‘socially dead’ the campus is and bring the campus together, ” he said.
Though Channel 18 is still no more than 
static, station managers and A.S. council mem-bers seem confident that several shows will launch later this week.
“Thanks to our new managers at SRTV , 
we’ve actually exponentially increased the amount of programming that it covers, ” said Gupta. “The amount of stuff that’s going to hit the network is amazing. The station came from being nearly dormant last year to being very active in filming different events across campus. ”

Complete with go-go dancers and L.E.D. lights 
from Daft Punk paradise, Voyeur transform
 itself every evening into a goth-glam den. Lest any Gaslamp District newbies 
get the wrong impression, let’s get the disclaimer out of the way: 
Voyeur is a nightclub. As such, expect the staples of any fine downtown-SD estab-lishment: weak, expensive drinks; rude, aloof bouncers and $20 no-list cover on a normal night ($40 for well-known talent, a la the MstrKrft and LA Riots show).
Despite its predictable club swag, 
Voyeur is a smart destination for Restaurant Week — an annual event dur-ing which over 180 San Diego restaurants offer three-course pre-set menus for $20, $30 or $40. Make a dinner reservation for later in the evening and stay for the club: Y ou’ll get three dishes for 20 bucks, and you won’t have to pay for cover. Choose from most of the options on its 
tapas-style menu — including the duck-confit tamales, lamb pops and banana fritters — then dance all the calories off.
As a relatively new venue, Voyeur 
has yet to develop a pigeonholed set of patrons (despite bumping electro and house music on regular rotation, and donning uber-hip goth-inspired decor). The crowd is hit-or-miss depending on who you are and who you’re looking for: On any given evening, you might find yourself getting crept on by Ed Hardy douche bags, stepped on by pompa-doured sisters in low-cut minidresses and out-danced by arm-flailing hipsters with dilated pupils.
If you’re going dilated, take some 
time to trip out on the impressive L.E.D. wall — including go-go dancers gyrating inside of it on prime nights. San Diego Restaurant Week only lasts from Jan. 17 to Jan. 22, but Voyeur’s 3-for-$20 deal will be available through the end of the month.

INFOCUS WINTER GAME FEST 2010
This weekend, video gamers from across 
SoCal and the darkest corners of our six-college sprawl gathered at the 
sixth annual Winter Game Fest: a video-game tournament chocked with 48 consoles, 72 television screens and 12 projectors; from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday through Sunday.
At this year’s event, the tournament added 
new  games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee, Madden 2010 and Call of Duty 4 to its menu of competitions, while staples from last year — including Guitar Hero, Starcraft and Halo 3 — stuck around. 
Aside from getting in on tournament action 
— which included separate competitions for each video game — participants also played on older consoles like Nintendo and Sega Genesis, basking in game-inspired art adorning the walls of the Price Center Ballrooms. 
With approximately $5,000 in cash prizes, this 
year’s fest attracted over 1,000 sets of the fastest fingers on the West Coast.

In the aftermath of the 7.0 quake that 
has already claimed an estimated 200,000 lives in Haiti, a new coali-
tion of UCSD students is focusing on how it can help those still alive. 
On Wednesday, Jan. 13 — while 
the fault lines running under Port-au Prince trembled in aftershock — Muir College senior Kenny Pettersen cre-ated a Facebook event for a glowstick vigil (to be held the following eve-ning) and planned to fundraise from a booth on Library Walk for the rest of the week. 
“I got tired of watching things on 
the news, and realized that there are a lot of resources here at UCSD, and a lot of students that have different gifts, ” Pettersen said.
By Thursday night, Pettersen had 
accumulated 1,400 Facebook follow-ers and raised over $3,000.
“It’s been amazing how well the 
school’s responded to everything, ” said Pettersen. 
For now, the network is mainly 
operating as a Facebook group (with 568 members as of Monday night), but Pettersen said this Tuesday’s meeting will possibly decide the group’s future (as an official student organization) as well as facilitate new fundraising ideas.
“There’s going to be help needed 
for many, many years to come, ” Pettersen said. “ At least for the rest of the school year, we’re going to be doing as much as possible to get stu-dents involved. ”
Though the nearly $5,500 the net-
work has collected so far will be going to the American Red Cross, many members are eager to discuss other options for long-term development in the country — not just emergency relief. The destruction that stretched out from the earthquake’s epicenter has decimated much of the country’s infrastructure; collapsing countless homes, hospitals, businesses and gov-ernment buildings.
“From my experience, Haiti has 
needed a lot of long-term develop-ment even before the earthquake, ” Pettersen said. “ And now with the earthquake, it has created so many more issues. ”
This past July, Pettersen took his 
seventh medical trip to Haiti. Though he plans to attend medical school in the fall, he said hopes that the stu-dent group can continue to help the Caribbean country under new leader-ship.
The UCSD Haiti Earthquake 
Response Network will hold its first meeting at 7 p.m. on Jan. 19 in Conference Room 513 of the Student Services Center.

CLUBHOPPING
JOHN  HANACEK /GUARDIANand making a music video for Lady Gaga’s “Teeth. ” 
The psychology-based cooking 
show “Cooking with Dr. D. ” aims to release academic anxieties: The show features a clinical psychologist from Los Angeles who discusses stress-management strategies by cooking. 
“Triton Vision Recap” — in its 
pre-programming stages, according to Dadourian — will feature sports updates, and “Will It Chop?” will be compromised of one-minute videos that feature a katana (Japanese sword) chopping household items like key-boards and phones.
“It’s a good illustration of how we 
can have TV shows that are more pro-fessional and serious, and that we can also have shows that people just shoot in their backyard, ” Dadourdian said.
Another proposed show aims to 
interview UCSD professors about where they came from and what opportunities they have for students.
“It’s introducing the diverse profes-
sors we have at UCSD to the student body; it’s a way for students to get involved, ” Dadourian said.
So far, the station managers have 
spoken to John Moore, a linguistics professor who dropped out of college to pursue flamenco dancing in Spain.
SRTV will also feature a weekly 
address by Gupta — giving updates on A.S. Council and Office of the President operations — along with sports games, student-org events and on-campus concerts. 
“What we’re witnessing now is the 
rebirth of SRTV as something more mainstream in campus life, ” he said.
Koala members have made it clear 
they plan on staying involved with SRTV by providing comedic content and focusing on student-life coun-terculture. According to Field, the Koala  will still be hosting a talk show 
(similar to last year’s) where students can call in and discuss the “topic of the day. ” 
“Now that SRTV is back, we’ve been waiting the whole quarter to get started. We think it’s going to be something that people can be excited about, ” Field said. “We want to do a lot more with pre-recorded stuff. ”
So far, he said they have written a 
comedy sketch on a self-defense class with Tiger Woods. “We’ll show you how to defend yourself if you’re a 120-pound blonde girl, ” Field said.
They also plan to film parties 
and host recreational activities like “Fraternity Olympics” .
Following Federal Communication 
Commission guidelines, the Koala  will 
be broadcasting their shows after 10 p.m., as they will be expected to air “indecent” material.
“The only thing that they’re regu-
lating is porn, because that’s what we did in the past. So we won’t be airing any porn … [not] immediately, any-way, ” Field said. “But other than that, we still generally follow the guidelines. We’re going to air out the tent, so we really won’t be doing anything that anyone can really get upset about. ”
Film-crew members who contrib-
ute to show production will be able to earn money in a work-study program that Gupta implemented in SRTV’s new charter.
I think it’s going to be successful; 
it’s going to lead SRTV to be much more productive and really record a lot more of student life, ” Gupta said. “They’ve been going around and recording student-organization events, helping me record my podcast and addresses. They’ve been really proac-tive in recording events that students want to have recorded, and maybe want to watch later on if they can’t make it to these events. ”
Now that SRTV is considered an 
A.S. service, it will receive additional funds — a result of the activity-fee ref-erendum last year. In the current A.S. budget, SRTV has $11,000 to spend this year on operating expenses and the work-study program.
With that money, the station has 
already bought two new high-defini-
tion video cameras and has converted from an all-analog to an all-digital station, so content can be uploaded directly from cameras and computers.
“We have state-of-the art, cutting-
edge technology as far as broadcasting and filming equipment goes, ” Hadian said. “Before, we were basically run-ning off VHS tapes. We had an entire back room full of them, so it was real-ly hard to find the content we needed. ”
To increase viewership, Gupta said 
SRTV is in the process of making con-tent available online so that students living off campus can tune in.
“What we’re trying to do is gain 
more of an off-campus presence than we have before, to reach the other half of the student community that doesn’t have access to the on-campus cable, ” said Gupta. “We’re doing this by try-ing to get our feeds online, so you can watch SRTV right in the convenience of your own computer. ”
But there is still much to be done. 
Grant said the because the studio floor is made of tile instead of car-pet, unwanted sounds become more noticeable — like ATM transactions, drunken conversation from Porter’s Pub and blaring beats from the Deejay Vinylphiles Club next door.
The A.S. Council and SRTV’s new 
management seem the most optimis-tic about the station’s new changes.
“I really want to see SRTV shine, ” 
Dadourian said. “I’ve been here while SRTV’s kind of been in the dumps, and I really want to see it do well. I really think it has the potential to do well and be successful. ”
Five years from now, Hadian said 
he sees SRTV as a grounded, profes-sional television station.
“If we don’t run into any more 
outrageous content, like porn being aired again, we’re going to be pretty robust on campus, ” he said. “SRTV will be a popular go-to station for the on-campus population. ”

B“Everyone swam really well today, 
and there were a lot of touch-outs 
where we won in the very last sec-ond, ” Shimura said. “It was really exciting, but nerve-wracking at the same time. ”
In the 200-yard freestyle, Henley 
won by two-hundredths of a second, O’Brien lost the 100-yard breaststroke by two-tenths of a second, freshman Amber Tan dropped the 50-yard free-style by three-hundredths of a second and Shimura won the 100-yard free-style by half a second. It was an incred-ibly close day, but the Tritons overcame their injuries to claim victory in more close races than not.
The best race for UCSD was the 
200-yard butterfly: The Tritons took all three top spots, led by senior Karla Holman’s time of 2:09.70. In their last race, the 400-yard freestyle relay — Shimura, Tan, Tse and Ferguson — won with a time of 3:30.65.
“There is definitely more prepara-
tion going into the meet against an in-city rival, ” Shimura said. “Before the meet we had a motivational speech from [head coach] Scott [McGihon], and that pumped us up. ”
The Tritons are back in action 
next weekend at Canyonview Pool for their last home meet of the year, which will be against California Baptist University.
It will be senior day — the last 
chance for many Triton swimmers to swim at their home pool before the final championship races.
“I want to have fun with it next 
week, ” Cunningham said. “I just want to enjoy my last meet at home and be with the team. But season-best times would be great. ”
Readers can contact Tyler Nelson at 
tcnelson@ucsd.edu.forced several turnovers that let them back into the game. UCSD took its first lead with 11:22 left in the first half, after Carlisle received a kick-out pass from senior guard Leilani Martin and knocked down a three — despite being fouled in the process. She then converted the free throw into a four-point play. 
The give-and-take of the first half 
was reflected in the score: The teams went into halftime tied at 32. 
“Every team is going 
to have their best game against us, and they are going to be emotion-ally high, ” junior forward Tiffany Hunter said. 
This was the first time 
in four games that the Tritons did not have the lead at halftime. But head coach Charity Elliot said she refused to panic. 
“Our mentality every 
game is to remain poised and calm, ” Elliot said. “So even when teams come out and jump out to a lead, we talk about being steady and just doing what we need to do. ” 
The Tritons came out 
of the locker room with new found intensity and took the lead with an Erin Noonan bucket at the 17:54 mark — a lead they would not relinquish. San Francisco State, howev-er, tried to stay in the game with tough work on the glass, out-rebounding the Tritons 38-32 and creating nine sec-ond-chance points in the second half.
The Gators cut the lead to nine after 
a three-pointer by Andrea Ohlssen with 5:09 remaining. Ilg answered back with a three of her own, and the Tritons kept a double-digit lead for the remainder of the contest. The game against CSUSF capped 
off a four-game home stand in which the Tritons defeated their opposition by an average of 16 points. The win improved the Triton season record to 14 unbeaten, 9-0 in conference play, right on the heels of a close 68-63 win over Cal State Monterey Bay on Thursday Jan 14. 
The Tritons survived a furious sec-
ond-half comeback against the Otters. UCSD took a seemingly comfort-
able 35-20 lead into half-time, but a feisty CSUMB refused to go away. The Otters poured in seven second-half three-point-ers and shot 45 percent from the field, cutting the lead to one point with 2:15 remaining. However, UCSD never surrendered the lead, making all their free throws down the stretch for the win.
The Tritons were paced 
by sophomore Chelsea Carlisle, who scored a game-high 20 points — including nine of the team’s final 11 points. 
The close game against 
CSUMB followed two rou-tine victories. Head coach Elliott said she was able to see the positives of with-
standing the comeback.
“I remind the team daily: It’s a 
process. And right now, we are still not as good as we need to be, ” she said. “It reminds us that we have a lot of work to do. ”
The Tritons will take a two-game 
road trip this week, with a matchup on Thursday at Humboldt State, followed by a game on Saturday at Sonoma State.

Athletes and administrators 
joined forces last Friday, Jan. 15 in 
the Green Room at RIMAC Arena to donate their blood at the UC San Diego Athletic Department’s 10th annual blood drive.
The event, hosted in conjunc-
tion with the American Red Cross, was organized by the Triton Athletes Council — a forum of student-ath-lete representatives from UCSD’s 23 sports teams — as a part of its com-munity service initiatives.
Senior Associate Athletic Director 
Ken Grosse collaborated with the TAC. He  said the event demonstrates the athletics department’s commit-ment to excellence on and off the field. 
“We’re completely focused on suc-
cessfully competing on the court and in the field, ” Grosse said. “However, equally important to us is success in the community. ”
According to Grosse, the blood 
drive is the largest on campus, and has also been named the No. 1 Southern California University donator by the Red Cross for three consecutive years. This year’s drive yielded 128 usable units — a 13-unit improvement over last year’s.
According to Grosse, approxi-
mately two-thirds of donations gen-erally come from student-athletes. Over the course of the afternoon, different teams came in together to make their contributions.
Though nervous about giving 
blood for the first time, Robert Sedin, a senior center fielder on the UCSD baseball team, said he was happy to contribute to an important cause.
“Every one of us makes a differ-
ence” Sedin said. “People everywhere need blood, and when all the athletes get together, it’s really special. ”
However, Sedin said he was appre-
hensive about the procedure.
“I have personally never given 
blood, and am a little scared, ” he said. “The thought of losing blood is creepy — I hope I don’t pass out. ”
The blood drive, which was open 
to the general public, attracted many faculty members and alumni.
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue, one of the faculty blood benefactors, spoke nostalgically about her first time at a blood drive.
“The first time I gave blood was as 
a freshmen in college, because there was an on-campus blood drive, ” Rue said. “I have been donating blood ever since” .
Rue stressed that giving blood 
now will help Red Cross in its earth-quake relief efforts in Haiti.
“Right now is especially impor-
tant for the Red Cross, ” she said. “This is a great opportunity for the Athletics Department to foster com-petition between athletes towards a greater goal. ”
Juanita Lake, team supervisor for 
the Red Cross, shared enthusiasm for the event.
“What a lot of people don’t know 
is that one in three people is in need of donated blood, ” Lake said. “In San Diego, only 3 percent of the popu-lation donates blood, so UCSD is definitely doing their part in trying to raise awareness. ”

every game is to remain poised and calm. So even when teams come out and jump out to a lead, we talk about being steady and just doing what we 
need to do.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL — After a disappoint-
ing 62-66 loss against Cal State Monterey Bay 
on Thursday night, the UCSD men’s basket-ball team looked to redeem itself against San Francisco State on Saturday. After 50 minutes of gut-wrenching battle, the Tritons pulled off a double-overtime victory against the Gators.
With six seconds left in the first over-
time, junior guard Casey Ryan nailed a clutch three-pointer, carrying the Tritons into double overtime. UCSD then carried his momentum to seal the victory 91-86.
Four Tritons scored in the double-digits,  
senior guard Jordan Lawley leading the way with a season-best 31 points. Sophomore center Christian Hatch bested her previous career high, scoring 16 points and sinking eight of nine shots from the floor. Ryan scored 12 points — including the last-second three — and senior guard Tyler Acevedo hit three triples in the game, finishing with 10 points. 
“Our competition level was there all 
[throughout the] game, ” head coach Chris Carlson said. “The payoff was there — because w e  w o r k e d  s o  h a r d  t o  g e t  t o  t h a t  p o i n t  a n d  compete at such a high level — and to have the win top it off was good. We improved tonight, and that’s a huge thing for us right now. ”
After jumping out the gates to a 22-11 
start, the Tritons slowed a bit and let the Gators go for a 13-3 run. And at 49-47, with nine minutes left in the second half, the game was still up for grabs.
The Gators gained momentum after taking 
a 51-49 lead, but Acevedo quickly answered back by netting a shot from outside the arc to put the Tritons back on top. 
Lawley hit a crucial three-pointer to give 
the Tritons a 62-60 advantage with three minutes left in play. With 10 seconds to go, the Gators — who were down 65-68 — called a timeout. Soon after, San Francisco State tied the game 65-65, forcing an overtime period. 
“We talked yesterday about pulling togeth-
er a 40-minute game and the guys really did that, ” said Lawley. “We all busted our butts out there and came out and proved that we wanted it. ”
The Gators carried their late momentum 
into overtime, taking the lead by as much as 76-70. Sophomore guard Jay Wey was the game’s unsung hero. He netted two critical three-pointers with one minute on the clock. Down 76-73 with six seconds left, Ryan seized the moment with a timely three-pointer to tie the game and force it into double overtime.
“Every single one of us on the court has 
the capability of making that shot, ” Lawley said. “Casey didn’t really have a look, but he threw it up and the prayer went in, so you just have to be thankful for it — and we capital-ized on it. ”
The Tritons took the late momentum and 
never looked back. Lawley nailed some criti-cal free throws down the stretch to give the Tritons a hard-fought 91-86 win. 
“It shows what type of competitive high we 
can reach, ” Carlson said. “If we do the things we’ve talked about on a consistent basis, we can be a tough out. There are still a lot of things we can improve on, and that’s really the biggest thing we’re trying to do: maintain an atmosphere where everyone can improve individually and collectively. ”
The win over the Gators followed a devas-
tating loss at RIMAC Arena against Cal State Monterey Bay last Thursday, Jan. 14. Trailing by as many as 12 points, UCSD came back to take a 55-53 lead with five minutes left to play. However, the men were unable to complete their comeback bid, and lost 62-66. 
UCSD is back on the road next week to 
take on the Humboldt State Lumberjacks on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.

SWIMMING & DIVING —  After 
competing in two meets last week-
end, the UCSD women’s swim team defeated Division-I crosstown rival University of San Diego for the ninth time in a row on Saturday, Jan. 16. The Tritons took 11 of the 16 events in close calls and touch-out wins.
In the end, the Tritons defeated 
the Toreros 168.5-130.5 at Canyonview Pool this past weekend. Senior captain Cari Cunningham looks forward to improving times before the conference championship meet next February.
“The girls were really pumped 
before the meet, ” Cunningham said. “We had eight straight victories, and we really wanted to make it nine. I really wanted to finish undefeated against them in my senior year. Y ou could see it in our swimming — we just wanted it. ”
In light of the dive meet results 
from Thursday, Jan. 14, Junior captain Anju Shimura stressed the importance of a strong start.
“We came into the meet 26 points 
behind after the dive meet Thursday, ” Shimura said. “We definitely caught up quickly with all the relays in the first event. ”
The day began with a half-second 
win for the UCSD 200-yard medley relay team — Shimura, sophomore Mercedes O’Brien, junior Jessica Ferguson and freshman Katherine Tse — with a time of 1:48.11.
Sophomore Alex Henley led the 
Tritons by winning the 200-yard free-style (1:52.89), the 200-yard back-stroke (2:04.45) and the 200-yard individual medley (2:09.13).
Shimura (100-yard freestyle, 100-
yard backstroke) and freshman Beth Dong (500-yard freestyle, 1,000-yard freestyle) both won two events for the Tritons. 
“We started off the meet really 
strong, ” Cunningham said. “It was defi-nitely what we needed to get going. ”
Both teams fought bitterly for 
advantage in a close race, with winners edging ahead by mere hundredths of seconds on several occasions.MEN TOP SF STATE IN DOUBLE OVERTIME=;,/1>-;
