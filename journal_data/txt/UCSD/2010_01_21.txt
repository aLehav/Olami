The earthquake that hit the 
Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince 
on Jan. 12 — claiming an estimated 200,000 lives, according to the Pan American Health Organization — also took the life of 24-year-old UCSD gradu-ate and Arizona native Daniel Ryan Kloos.
Ryan, who 
went by his mid-dle name, was in Haiti visiting his sister Erin Kloos, age 27. She was one of four Americans volunteering at Friends of the Orphans, a subset of the children’s charity Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos.
At the time of his death, Ryan was 
at the Father Wasson Center, a chil-dren’s hospital where his sister worked. When the 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit, five of the hospital’s seven sto-ries collapsed, killing both Ryan and another volunteer, Molly Hightower, age 22.  
Ryan graduated from Muir 
College in 2008 with a double major in Sociology and Biochemistry/ General Biology, and had just been accepted to two schools of osteopath-ic medicine, according to close friend and classmate Liz Costa.

On Jan. 11, the California State 
Assembly Committee passed a bill aimed at allocating more funds to higher education with five affirma-tive votes and two negative votes. Bill AB 656, authored by Assemblyman Alberto Torrico (D–Fremont), will impose an excise tax on oil com-panies that extract oil and natural gas from the state’s land and water sources.
If passed by the California State 
Legislature, the bill would create the California Higher Education Endowment Corporation. The cor-poration would be run by represen-
tatives from the California State University system, the University of California and community col-leges and would be responsible for allocating the money each year.
Earlier this 
month, the bill was amended to incur a 12.5-per-cent severance tax, as opposed to 
the previously proposed 9.9-percent tax. According to an analysis by the Assembly Committee on Revenue and Taxation, the tax will now be expected to raise $1.8 billion in 2010 and $2 billion in 2011. 
Prior to recent amendments, 
the bill would have sent 60 per-cent of revenue to the CSU sys-tem, 30 percent to the UC system and just 10 percent to community colleges. After the  urging of the 
Faculty Association of California Community Colleges, however, the bill was rewritten and now directs 50 percent of its revenue to the CSU 
system, 25 percent to the UC sys-tem and 25 percent to community colleges.
“We have allowed oil companies 
in California to extract oil from our ground and we have failed to charge

After the grand opening of the Sustainability Resource Center last November, members of the Student Sustainability Collective and Campus 
Sustainability administrators have not yet come to an agreement over how to share the space. 
According to SSC student director Rishi 
Ghosh, the center was conceived two years ago when students approached university adminis-trators with hopes to begin the project. When student activity fees were raised last Spring Quarter — providing the SSC with an addi-tional $2.34 per-student per-quarter for proj-ects and staff — SSC members were under the impression their new efforts would be housed by the collaborative space.
Since then, however, university staff and 
student leaders have disagreed on the role of students in the center — leaving the SSC with-out the opportunity to utilize the SRC on a consistent basis.“The spirit of the referendum, the way we 
advertised it, was that the funding was for students working right in the new SRC, ” A.S. President Utsav Gupta said. “That was the con-text in which we had all these discussions with 
the administration — until it totally flipped. It was a bait-and-switch. ”
According to the SRC’s Web 
site, its original intention was 
to “house UCSD’s sustainability staff and the student-funded and -run SSC. ”
As no form has yet been signed indicating 
an understanding of the two groups’ control of the center, however, only the CSS currently has full access the space.
In the months following the student-fee 
referendum, plans for the center were arranged verbally between students and staff. University 
UCSD graduate Daniel 
Ryan Kloos was killed while volunteering for a children’s hospital.)4=56=;

After more than six hours of debate, the A.S. 
Council voted 20-7-1 late Wednesday night to 
place the Loft referendum on the Spring Quarter election ballot. If approved by the student body, the proposal would raise student fees by $3.82 per 
student per quarter. The money would go toward 
art and music programming at the Loft.
The referendum requires that at least 29 per-
cent of the fees go to financial aid, that at least 80 percent of all events at the Loft be “pay as you can” for UCSD students and that undergraduates rep-resent at least 60 percent of the venue’s hiring staff. During yesterday’s meeting, the council dis-
cussed two models of the referendum — one sponsored by A.S. Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs and chair of the University Centers Advisory Board Jordan Taylor, and one sponsored by A.S. President Utsav Gupta. 
The primary difference between the two 
proposals was the intensity of A.S. Council oversight. 
Under Gupta’s proposal, the A.S. Council 
would create a student-majority Loft Governance Board to regulate the venue’s budget allocation.  This board would include various members of Oil Tax

Researchers from UCSD have developed a 
“baby robot” to simulate the growth and develop-
ment of a one-year-old child.
Named Diego-San, the robot is used to conduct 
research on the brain development of children. It is part of the Machine Perception Laboratory — part of UCSD’s division of Calit2 and the Institute for Neural Computation at UCSD — whose mission is to create a robot that can learn and develop senso-ry-motor and communicative skills of infants. 
Dr. Javier Movellan, principal investigator and 
founder of MPL, created Diego-San in order to study how babies acquire problem-solving skills that are, traditionally, difficult to reproduce with robots. 
“The idea came from the fact that many prob-
lems in robotics and artificial intelligence have been very difficult to solve with classic A.I. approaches, ” Movellan said. “Y et babies solve, within one year of life, the most complicated problems effortlessly. ”
Movellan said he created the project to under-
stand the complex brain development of a baby when it learns the motor and social skills necessary to survive.
The four-foot, 66-pound humanoid robot is 
equipped with a head that houses 20 moving parts that make facial expressions without speaking, two high-definition cameras for eyes, an audio speaker for a mouth and a six-axis accelerometer for ears, to detect orientation and movement. 
The robot also has five-fingered hands that can 
hold objects like water bottles. It has sensors that detect the pressure points placed on different joints in its body, and can stand up from a chair.
The main goal, according to Movellan, is for the 
robot to carry out all these functions independently by integrating motor control functions in social interactions with only the help of its sensors and activators. 
MPL is currently in its second phase of the proj-
ect — which includes developing the control elec-tronics and software — and is trying to replicate the way babies learn motor movements.
Specifically, the researchers want the robot to 
be able to recognize facial expressions, learn and recognize the appearance of its caregivers, reach objects on its own without human aid and use ges-tures like pointing, reaching and grasping for items. 
 To do so, researchers are currently working 
on an algorithm that integrates a multidisciplinary approach of bringing together the fields of physics, electronics and psychology.
 “The robot really is an instrument for research 
and our goal is to push the limits of robot control, ” Movellan said. We want it to have similar proper-ties to that of a human being and the level of com-plexity similar to that of a human being. ”
The robot has already been publicized in a 
newsletter published by Kokoro, a company in the Sanrio Group that specializes in animated robots and automated machinery. It has also been featured in several tech blogs, such as www.gizmodo.com, to mostly negative responses on the baby’s appearance. 
Of the responses from blogs, Movellan said, 
“One of my students told me about this. I was sur-prised that this made it through the Internet. ”  
He said did not expect the newsletter to reach 
the Internet. But now, he said he sees the feed-back as an opportunity to improve the robot’s design. For example, he plans to change the aesthetics of the face by working with Hanson Robotics, who collaborated with MPL on the Einstein robot.
Movellan responded to some of the blogs, clari-
fying that researchers were still in the initial phase of developing the robot’s body (which was con-structed by Kokoro, along with the head).
After the developmental phase, MPL is planning 
to train the robot.
“It’s been great [because it’s] such a challenging 
project that tests you in so many different ways, ” Movellan said. “What I expect from the project is a better understanding of the nature of human intel-ligence. ”
The research began in September 2008. Diego-
San is part of Project One, funded by the National Science Foundation.
As far as a projected date for completion, 
Movellan said that — though the funding will be cut off in 2013 — work on Diego-San is likely to continue much longer.
“The project is part of an ongoing effort to 
understand the development of intelligence in infants from a computational point of view, ” Movellan said. “The effort is likely to continue for as long as I am alive. ”

Calit2 engineers created Diego-San to mimic the learning patterns 
of a baby, including face recognition.NEWS THURSDAY , JANUARY 21, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 
Centers designated a space for it in 
Price Center. 
The administration agreed to 
fund renovations to the space while students and staff negotiated the terms of how the space was to be shared between advocates. The agreement was to be authenticated with the signing of a Memorium of Understanding by the SSC and CSS, to establish the presence of each group in the space. 
According to Ghosh, SSC mem-
bers hoped to have the MOU signed prior to the center’s opening last November. 
“We were of the opinion all the 
hard work was done, ” Ghosh said. “We just needed to sign the MOU. ”
However, the SCC has failed to come to an agreement with Campus Sustainability Coordinator Margaret Souder since then; as a conse-quence, Souder has not allowed stu-dents to use the space freely.
According to Souder, the two 
groups have been unable to reach a final agreement because represen-tatives from the SSC continue to change their stance on the details of the MOU. 
“We’ve had several meetings and 
were all in agreement, ” Souder said. “But then the SSC would have come back with new ideas and wouldn’t agree anymore. ” 
New changes were proposed 
over multiple meetings, according to Souder. 
“In the details is where it falls 
through, ” Souder said. “We come up with an agreement and everyone is happy. Then, a few people want changes, and we begin discussions again and come to a new agreement. In the last few meetings, though, an agreement hasn’t been reached. ” 
Members of the SSC have 
expressed frustration with the dis-cussions. Ghosh said that Souder has recently retracted promises she outlined verbally in original discus-sions of the MOU. 
“It actually was worked out ear-
lier, ” Ghosh said. “It’s just that it was worked out verbally. We were made specific promises. [Souder] had consistently told us her supervisors were on board. It was not as if we just stormed in. We had gone through

Awet Wednesday night and 
a leaking fourth-floor forum didn’t hinder the A.S. 
Council from finally deciding the fate of the Loft Referendum. 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue first addressed 
the council. She discussed planning for the next fiscal year, and warned councilmembers that Student Affairs programs will be cut further due to the grow-ing state deficit.
But Rue’s pre-
sentation wasn’t entirely filled with depressing statistics — she spoke of UCSD’s coming 50th anniversary during the 2010-11 academic year, and the festivities and flair surround-ing the anticipated yearlong celebra-tion. 
About two of the six total hours 
the council dedicated to the Loft dis-cussion consisted of debate between two different proposals for Loft oversight. The council discussed President Utsav Gupta ’s suggestion 
to create a Loft Governance Board, as well as University Center Advisory Board Chair Jordan Taylor ’s recom-
mendation that the existing commit-tee continue regulating the Loft. 
The council voted 16-11 in favor 
of Taylor’s proposal over Gupta’s. Once the governing body proposal was finalized, the council amended the referendum line by line.
Once the language of the Loft 
Referendum was passed a few hours later, the council took to debate over whether or not the referendum should appear on the Spring 2010 ballot.
Strong arguments were heard 
from both sides. 
“The Loft is a part of student life, ” Taylor said. “We saw 1,500 student signatures in support, and if that’s not enough to convince you that this needs to go to a student vote, then I don’t know what is. ”
AVP Enterprise Operations Rishi 
Ghosh was a vocal opponent against the referendum. 
“When educa-
tion funds have gone down dra-matically, why are we entertaining the idea of fund-ing entertain-ment?” Ghosh said. “It’s frivolous 
to what I think is our core function as a governing body. ”
Muir College Senator Lynne 
Swerhone summed up the arguments 
nicely: “I feel like no one’s going to read this proposal, ” she said, and the room filled with snaps in agreement.
After three more hours of debate 
and a 20-7-1 vote, the council decided that the Loft referendum will appear on the Spring Quarter 2010 ballot. A round of applause followed — the decision was made just past 1 a.m.
During question time, Sixth 
College Senator Kevin Nguyen 
and Warren College Senator Alyssa 
Wing  appeared before the council, 
armed with a colorful poster that read, “ Associated Students, will you go to Spirit Night with me?” Nguyen and Wing, in a continuation of their senator project, insisted on A.S. Council support at the Jan. 30 bas-ketball game against Cal State San Bernardino.
After a long eight hours, the 
council retired for the night, and Marshall Chair Tanvir Dhillon gra-
ciously offered a ride so fellow coun-cilmembers wouldn’t have to walk home in the rain.)\4WVO4I[\\PM,ZI_VW]\
4WN\;IOI+WUM[\WI+TW[Mthem an extraction fee,  as every 
other state in the country currently does, ” Torrico said. “ AB 656 will address that problem directly. ” 
According to CEO of the 
California Independent Petroleum Association Rock Zierman, one common objection to this bill is that it would cause an increase in gas prices — something Californians in today’s economic crisis can ill afford.
Torrico, however, said that AB 
656 wouldn’t allow for such a price jump.
“The bill specifically prohibits oil 
companies from passing along the severance fee to consumers at the pump, ” Torrico said.
The text of AB 656 states that 
not only are gas companies forbid-den from “using the tax as a pretext to materially raise the price of oil, ” but also that the State Board of Equalization is licensed to investi-gate any producers that they sus-pect of doing so. However, Zierman doubts  the bill’s ability to realisti-
cally restrain gas prices, despite its strong wording. 
“[Torrico’s claim] is true and it’s 
not true, ” Zierman said. “The only companies that [the investigation] would affect are the fully integrated companies that extract crude oil from the ground and take it all the way to their gas stations. What this bill can’t stop is an increase in gas prices. Y ou can’t completely prohibit an increase in the price of gas — that’s a global market. ”
The bill is backed by the 
California Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union and the UC Student Association. 
“I think 656 will provide us with 
an important alternative source of revenue to allow education to be prioritized in this state, ” UCSA President Victor Sanchez said. “It’s 
the solution that’s out there, the one that’s the most tangible and it’s the one that has the most backing and is moving forward. We’re waiting to see what’s going to happen. ” 
While Sanchez is uncertain about 
the fiscal effects that the bill would have on oil companies and oil-dependent industries, he stressed the need for additional funding for universities and colleges.
“We don’t know what the impli-
cations would be [for consumers], but we do know what it would mean for higher education in California, ” Sanchez said.
Having passed out of commit-
tee, the bill must now face both houses of the legislature. Since AB 656 pertains to revenue and budget-ary issues, it requires a two-thirds majority from the state senate and assembly.

THIS
WEEK?Flops to John Freshwater, an eighth-grade teacher in 
Ohio, for burning a cross onto two students’ arms in an 
attempt to force his religious beliefs onto them.Props to President Obama for asking lawmakers to 
approve an additional $1.3 billion education initiative intended to spur innovation in schools.
Attendance doesn’t usually 
count in college. Y our biol-ogy professor won’t notice if 
you don’t show up to your 300-person lecture, and there’s little consequence to ditching a dorm meeting besides missing out on a free slice of pizza. 
But when you’re an A.S. coun-
cilmember who earned the student body’s vote on enthusiastic promises of change and visibility, the very least you can do is make an appearance at your own weekly meeting. 
Showing up is a minimum 
requirement that — according to A.S. Advocate General Parminder Sandhu — many A.S. councilmem-bers have been struggling to meet. 
Four members are one absence away 
from the council’s three-absence maximum, and six have surpassed it. Sandhu now plans to nominate them for impeachment at the A.S. Council meeting during Week Four. 
And rightfully so. In a perfect 
world, the councilmembers we elect-ed last year would gauge their peers’ perspectives, then vote accordingly at 
meetings. But if members aren’t even 
showing up for meetings, it’s likely they’re not surveying the general pub-lic. And if they’re not surveying the general public, they’re probably not doing much else.
True, a handful of councilmem-
bers have still been productive out-side of weekly meetings. But their absence also slows the council’s prog-ress on collaborative initiatives by necessitating repeat information.
We understand that discussing 
referenda language for six hours isn’t the most stimulating way to spend a Wednesday night, but there’s more to being a student representative than making posters and designing bear paraphernalia. All A.S. councilmem-bers knew what they were signing up for when they ran for election, and if they aren’t honoring their commit-ment, they don’t deserve to buffer their resume with some official-sounding position any longer. 
According to Sandhu, excus-
ing an absence prior to a meet-ing is as simple as saying “I have a class. ” Y ou’ d think the impeachable councilmembers 
would at least care enough to lie 
about why they’re ditching. 
Problem is, the council 
threatens to impeach no-shows almost every year, but never does. In 2008-09, Campuswide Senator Henry David Ritcherson missed the vast majority of meetings, but no one 
noticed. By the time 
his absences finally came up in Spring Quarter, there was so little time left that no one wanted to impeach him.
Maybe this year it’ll be differ-
ent, but — despite the fact that A.S. President Utsav Gupta’s supports Sondhu’s impeachment nomina-tions — the A.S. General Advocate still needs two-thirds of council’s approval to move the process along. Considering a majority of members don’t want to upset their cushy, non-committal community or endanger their own right to ditch out, it’s unlikely anyone will be voted off the island. Furthermore, even the nonvoting 
members — who have accumulated a good amount of absences themselves — have submitted an amendment to the council’s Standing Rules that would eliminate their obligation to come to meetings altogether.
What can we say that’s not pains-
takingly obvious? Don’t run for office if you’re not planning on showing up to meetings. Make the impeachment of voting councilmembers who’ve exceeded the limit a more execu-
tive decision. Maybe then they 
might show enough commit-
ment to lie and say they’re 
having car troubles. It’s 
the least our representa-
tives can do to show one 
of their only obligations 
some scrap of respect.

At the risk of being branded a 
crazed cat lady, I’ll confess: Anything involving those 
lethargic lumps of fluff I’ve called pets all my life is of great fascination to me. 
So when I came across this online 
scandal starring an especially press-worthy kitty, I was all ears. Turns out a couple from Boston thought it’ d be funny to include their furry “son” on a census, identifying the animal as Sal Esposito. 
Though the pair explicitly stated 
Sal’s status as a non- Homo sapien  
(read: cat), that minor detail still slid under the rug of the Suffolk court-house, and the feline was summoned to jury duty. Then, when the Espositos attempted to disqualify the feline, the jury commissioner decided the house-cat still had to show.
Without trying to stereotype, 
I’ll be frank: Anyone who fills out a census and includes the names of his or her pets is a freak. One can safely assume that Mrs. E knew the pet police wouldn’t come pounding on her door had she not included little Sal — but she had to list the smallest family member anyway.
As a cat enthusiast who’s owned 
a geriatric, obese Siamese monster for 14 years, I nonetheless must dis-tance myself from the likes of Mrs. E. Prematurely aging your cat by naming him after an old Italian dude is one thing (Sal, please pass the prunes), but bringing the troublemaker to the courthouse, as if he’ d otherwise get arrested? Listen, Lady — I know you love Sal, but he is not your son. Nor does he give a crap about human justice.
Admittedly, my family isn’t much 
better. I’ve witnessed human-feline interaction evolve from a simple pet-and-purr exchange to my mom asking my sister if she wouldn’t mind sleeping on the couch because Spanky was used to taking her bed. See, Mom didn’t want the change of environs to excite poor Spank into a heart attack.
Now our bedrooms are hand-me-
down lounges for the exclusive breed-ing of fleas. Cool. Thanks, Mom.
Cat lovers everywhere cater to 
their companions like children, but kicking your firstborn onto the couch for a kitty’s sake? Too much. There’s a reason that Garfield and Jon Arbuckle could never talk shit on Odie to each other: There’s a respected division between species.
My mom and Mrs. E have crossed 
the line. And they’re not alone. Take a walk in your neighborhood on a breezy Sunday, and you can bet your bottom dollar that at least one visored Betty will be walking a sweater-cozied bulldog named Horace, with whom she will be having a full-fledged con-versation.
I can only hope that womankind 
will revert back to the good days, 
when best-friend cats were distanced 
to the appropriate middle ground: beloved playthings, but clear-cut inferiors (sorry, PETA). But as Mrs. E has demonstrated, America is only becoming more pet obsessed. Any attempt to undo Paris Hilton damage on pet relations would be futile.  It’s 2010, baby, and what Fluffy wants, Fluffy gets.  The Surf

The UCSD Guardian  is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2010. Views expressed herein represent the majority 
vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily 
those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 
the members of the Guardian  staff. 
Despite decades of evidence to the contrary, 
there’s always something we want to trust in the goobery handshakes of student-life 
administrators, spectacles a-sparkle, promising us the world.
Two years ago, the promise was a space for the sole 
purpose of streamlining sustainability efforts on campus: 
a snazzy center where both the Student Sustainability 
Collective and university officials could combine their scat-
tered, homeless initiatives under one roof; a lean, green, tree-hugging machine.
The Sustainability Resource Center — now 
located next door to Price Center Theater, in what used to be the EDNA info booth — was originally a brainchild of the SSC. The organiza-tion offered to pay for it through student activ-ity fees, allotted quarterly by the A.S. Council.
That’s when university officials kindly stepped in, offering 
to pay all construction and rent costs, so that A.S. funds — which now abound, since student activity fees were inflated last year, with a special line for the SSC — could go 100 percent toward the projects themselves.
Surely student leaders must have felt, for a moment, that 
they might just be on the same team as the Man, all money and power aside — especially for the sake of something so blatantly common-good as slowing the gassy death of our dear planet Earth.
The center’s Web site is still taglined with its startup mis-
sion: to “house” both university staff and SSC representatives in a “collaborative space” to realize “common goals. ”
Despite this noble goal, now that construction rubble has 
cleared and recycled-material furniture been pushed into its right place, the SSC can hardly call the center a home. Simple initiatives like a campuswide bike-rental program and electronic-waste bins are having trouble getting off the ground, as they have no central place to exist: Campus Sustainability Coordinator Maggie Souder won’t allow students to set up any additional fixtures inside the SRC.
In fact, according to SSC student director Rishi Ghosh, they 
aren’t even allowed to put anything on the shelves or the walls. Students can only use the meeting space by appointment — and even those can be overridden by administrative agenda.

They don’t hold keys to the building.
Souder blames the student shutout 
on their own inability to present her 
with an agreeable right-to-use form, which would lay out the guidelines for their presence in the center. But ultimately, it’s up to Souder’s discre-tion whether students should be able come and go in the interim. The space “rules” she’s set up are clearly arbitrary hurdles, serving to shut the strewn backpacks and collegiate commotion out of her pristine new office as long as possible.
Meanwhile, the student vision of 
a bustling community lounge has lost the good fight to UCSD’s token taste for anal feng shui. Seems administra-tors will never stop trying to convince us we like Ikea ottomans and white space as much as they do. Green, chilly and spotless, the SRC looks and feels not unlike music/art venue the Loft a few chain restaurants down — nice-looking and new-smelling, but not us. Not college. So from here on out, let’s at least get our promises in writing.
(Granted, the Loft wasn’t created 
under the same pretense that students were going to get some say in its goings-on. We weren’t even asked to pay — not directly, at least. Although now that the Loft is going on the A.S. referendum as a potential student cost, what do you say we bulldoze that UFO lamp and graffiti over the olive-puke wall paint?) The entire SRC lobby area is dedi-
cated to bragging about the center’s uber-progressive building materials — vintage wood flooring; translucent window panes and Polygal walls to maximize daylight (even though the ceiling is riddled with light fixtures); furniture shaped so sustainably your body enters a state of absolute space-age efficiency. 
It reeks of public relations, not 
progress. And all the while, the SSC is sitting on a budget the size of the ozone hole. Not to be dramatic, but trees are dying. Glaciers are melting. Polar-bear cubs are crying. It’s the kind of sadness that warrants a clut-tered bulletin board and the sacrifice of personal desk space.

Dear Editor,
I wish to bring more coverage to 
the clicker technology being used in classrooms. Y ou might already be familiar with it; however, I did notice that only a handful of classes at UCSD use this system, so I’ll provide a short background from my perspective.
Certain classes require each stu-
dent to buy a wireless clicker device that works as a remote control. Each student’s clicker communicates with a wireless hub that the professor brings to class, and this serves as a wireless voting system. 
Professor of molecular biology 
Susan Golden uses this system for BILD 1 to track students’ participa-tion, and can thus objectively award points toward their final grades. She generally asks a multiple-choice ques-tion and opens up the poll for those of us in class to choose an answer. She then discusses the right answer and has real-time results of the poll to see how the entire class is doing in under-standing the subject matter that she just taught. 
This has several advantages — it 
allows students an opportunity to think critically during lectures, and it allows the professor to gauge students’ understanding of the material in real-time. It also allows the entire class to participate without feeling bad about selecting an incorrect answer. I think it’s fair, useful and I like the system.However, I would like to bring 
serious attention to two facts: First, the clicker device is extremely expen-sive! In addition to requiring a $180 textbook for the class, students are now required to spend upward of $40 for a clicker. Secondly, it appears that there are three to four different clicker devices from different manufacturers that are all incompatible with each other, and some professors use one system and others use the other. 
This is a serious oversight on the 
part of the professors and the univer-sity to not have one system so that students do not incur multiple costs for different systems that provide the same service. Not to mention, students have to carry multiple bulky clickers around (although this, in principle, is insignificant to the larger issue). 
My hope is that students will stand 
up against what seems like a broken system which only burdens them with higher costs.

The anthem of vola-
tile youth, Kubrick’s adaptation of 
Anthony Burgess’ dark, violent novel is equally offbeat and haunt-ing. Set in futuristic London, the film cen-ters on Alex (Malcolm McDowell), A psycho-pathic gang leader who settles down for a nice glass of milk and some Beethoven after rip-ping open young girls’ throats.
When Alex is arrest-
ed for rape and murder, he undergoes behavior therapy to purge his violent tendencies — only the therapy itself is brutal and sadistic. It can be quite a sobering surprise if you go in unaware, but “Orange” remains a horrific favorite for its exhila-rating pace, perversity and harsh honesty. So if you and the droogs can’t make up your ras-soodocks about what do to for the evening, head to Kensington for the bets kind of violence. Jeff Bridges is the Dude — a bathrobe wearing, White 
Russian-drinking bowler who keeps to himself. That is, until two porn-industry gangsters invade his home in a case of mis-taken identity, and soil one very important rug that really tied his living room together. Seeking retribution for his prized carpet, el 
Duderino  locates the 
perpetrator: Lebowski. During their meeting, Lebowski commissions the Dude to rescue his kidnapped trophy wife. Throw in ultra-feminist daughter Maude, a Vietnam vet with anger issues, a handful of nihilists and a very wet ferret, and you’ve got “The Big Lebowski” — it never disappoints. The Dude always draws a large slippered crowd, mostly belligerent, so grab a Russian, pour it in a discrete thermos and get there early.With the tagline “Man is the warmest place to 
hide, ” how could this film go wrong? “The Thing” details the story of a research team in the Antarctic that dis-covers a parasitic alien presence. 
Aside from being 
the biggest sausage fest in the known universe (even the dog is male), “Thing” is an excel-lent horror movie that exploits the classic thriller theme of mys-terious rabid disease. Though you might have seen it done since in “The Invasion” and “The Faculty, ” the idea originated from this fresh take on claustro-phobic paranoia. It’s an enjoyably tense ride on which no one and nowhere is safe. Though most of us can’t remember the 1982 release of 
this cutesy alien flick, only the unborn have never heard E.T’s heart-wrenching request to “phone home. ” What childhood would be complete without the story of Elliot (Henry Thomas) and Gertie (Drew Barrymore), two siblings who discover a pint-sized alien in their backyard? They teach their wrinkly visitor everything about Earth culture, from basic language to Halloween dressup. In return, E.T. eats all of their candy and establishes a psychic connection with Elliot that makes everyone think he’s psy-chotic. Before Spielberg developed a bad habit of throwing money into terrible Shia Labeouf films, he invented the warm, fuzzy feeling with golden-age “E.T. ” This classic made QT’ s last name a verb (Tarantino: 
to upset a film’s time sequence so severely that all heads in the audience cock to one side in confusion and awe). If you’re unfa-miliar with Tarantino’s particular blend of blood and verbal lyri-cism, this is the perfect introduction. In 1994, he had just enough popularity to garner a decent budget, but not so much that it clouded his judg-ment (see “Kill Bill, Part Douche”). Three seemingly unrelated stories cross each other unexpectedly in this masterly woven tale of a mob boss and his heroin-addicted wife, the boxer he paid to throw a match and two very Travolta and Jackson hitmen. What happens when Jim Henson aban-
dons his Muppet fam-ily to team up with David Bowie for an ’80s fantasy film about a Goblin King? 
Pure magic. In a 
style characteristic of the time (think “Gremlins, ” “Big Trouble in Little China” and “Legend”), a caterpillar-eye-browed Jennifer Connelly has to tra-verse a magical laby-rinth to retrieve her baby brother from the clutches of Jareth the Goblin King — com-plete with fairy dust and an embarrassingly large codpiece. Y ou’ll love this film (if you don’t already) for its unabashed camp and knee-slapping puppet-ry. After all, Henson isn’t happy unless his hand is up the skirt of one character or another. ,KP[VYZ¸7HWPSSPVU¹

Just a little less than two weeks until the premiere of “Lost”’s final season, and I’m getting 
antsy. Think about all the questions we need answered: Is John Locke really dead, and is that mysterious Man in Black possessing him? What caused the statue of Tawaret to be destroyed, leaving only a foot behind? What happened when the hydrogen bomb exploded and everything went white — did Oceanic 815 land in Los Angeles? 
Judging by the newly confirmed 
title of season six’s first episode, “LA X, ” it’s still up for debate. The “X” in the acronym is deliberately separated from “LA ” by a space, conjuring up images of Los Angeles International but also hinting that “X” is a variable. 
As Faraday clearly explains in season 
five’s “The Variable”: “Whatever hap-pened, happened. All right? But then I finally realized ... I had been spending so much time focused on the con-stants, I forgot about the variables. Do you know what the variables in these equations are, Jack?”
In essence, Faraday is saying that 
Jack, Kate and company have the power to mess with time and the universe if they use big enough tools — the hydrogen bomb being the boulder in the proverbial river. So it’s clear they can change the course of history, but that doesn’t answer anything. We’re left waiting for the last episodes like crack connoisseurs who’ve invested lots of time, money and energy in their crack hobby — which is why I’ve decided to provide my own all-encompassing theory that explains every single answer to LOST …wait for it: lizards. Seven-foot-tall, bloodthirsty, shape-shifting lizards.
In truth, these past few weeks 
I’ve been reading conspiracy theo-ries on the Interwebs — you know, the Bilderberg Group, the 9/11 Conspiracy, mind control, etc.— and I stumbled on the Godfather of them all: David Icke. His dense New Age book “The Biggest Secret” spends over 500 pages weaving trans-lated ancient texts and secondhand accounts of lizard man sightings all to conclude that the world’s elite are really a disguised alien race called the Annunaki planning global domina-tion. So in honor of Mr. Icke, I’m going to transpose his fairly insane yet compelling theories onto the world of “Lost” speculation.
Here we go:Jacob and the Man in Black are 
both highly evolved reptilians; one embraces humans and leads them to the island’s secrets, and the other has no faith in humanity. They have existed on Earth since ancient times, at least dating back to the Egyptians, but have never reached out openly to humans until the fateful day that Jacob calls the Black Rock (a 19th century slave ship) to the Island. 
One of the passengers on this ship 
is the mysterious Richard Alpert, still unfamiliar with the Island’s magic, but Jacob takes him under his wing and teaches him about eternal life. Richard becomes Jacob’s pri-Warning:

Do you enjoy blasts of 
white noise? How about harnessed feed-
back anarchy, when instru-ments turn incoherent? 
At first, HEALTH 
might not seem like your sonic bag. The LA four-some culls power-tronics and abrasive beats from bashing experimentalists like Liars and manage to cram in post-punk, hard-core and techno sheen. But get this: no screaming. Just Jake Duzsik’s ghost-in-the-machine monotone sylla-bles, a lulling counterpoint to the madness behind him. 
Not as immediately 
tasty as last week’s Vampire Weekend expose, but you need bands like HEALTH to yank your mind in dis-parate directions with gui-tar stabs and tempo shifts.
Dip your toes into the 
great, murky pool that is HEALTH’s alienation with new single “Die Slow, ” and watch the morphing chords and ’90s rap-speed beat grab you. Intrigued? Wade further with “We Are Water, ” a hardcore drill sergeant wrapped in dance gauze, to keep the head nodding and tease at some-thing more visceral. 
Finally, to prepare your 
body for the show this Saturday, try “Triceratops” off their self-titled debut. A feedback swirl and crash cymbals lead into a robo-strobe beat, riding in like a freak train, barely waiting for you to hop on before devolving into A.D.D. squalor. The last third of the track reaches ambient trem-olo bliss as BJ Miller slams the shit out of his toms until they fade to paced drums. HEALTH proves rock can still shock — it hasn’t all been done before.

are your heads at right now in your 
vision of HEALTH for this year? JF: Well, yes actually, because 
our next release is DISCO2, the 
sequel to our remix album, which is naturally dancey. But for future HEALTH projects, yes with an ‘and, ’ and if with a ‘but, ’ not gonna make an album of dance beats, but defi-nitely want to keep streamlining the “groove” aspect and produce things in a way that is more electronic bassy. G: How do you engage the audi-
ence in spaces that might not be as conducive to your frantic live show? The Loft is a fairly upscale bar and lounge, for example. What’s your mentality when getting ready to play at a space like that? JF: We just do it. We’ve really con-
ditioned ourselves from years of playing; We can do it anywhere. Also for college shows, it’s par for the course. G: What band is inspiring you guys 
most right now in what you’re doing with your own music, and why? Any new bands from LA you want to shout out? JF: No one really, and I’m not being 
a dick. We do keep taking influence from other music, but it’s mostly just song concepts or musical tricks. At the moment we’re listen-ing to Top-40 radio … really dying for a good new record to listen to at the moment. There’s a new band in LA called TEARIST, which I think is pretty cool. Also, I’ d love to shout out Pictureplane from Denver — his 2009 album Dark Rift  
is amazing. G: After the SD show, you guys are 
going to quickly tour Canada and then it’s off to New Zealand and Australia. What was it like getting that tour booked? JF: Well, there’s never really much 
of an adventure of getting a tour booked, its just some e-mails, and you cross your fingers.G: Do you have any vacation plans 
while you’re there, aside from play-ing music? JF: Totally. We’ve never been, so 
we’re taking days off to hang (which we rarely do on most tours). Hoping to hit up the black sand beaches and see some countryside. G: What’s HEALTH’s dream collabo-
ration? If you could do a song with any artist working now, who would you pick and why? JF: We’ve always wanted to do a song 
with Johnny Jewel of Glass Candy.  G: P .S. My funny HEALTH fact: 
Way back when, there was a post on Craigslist wanting a vocalist for a band based in LA, listing influ-ences like Liars and the Locust ... it was you dudes. My hometown 
is Thousand Oaks, a suburb about 
45 minutes north of Los Angeles, but I answered the post because I was looking to join a new band and I loved all the influences you had put down. At the time, it bummed me out that I couldn’t join (I think I was still in high school). Just thought I’ d share that, take it easy guys. 
JF (laughing): I forgot about that. We 
never used anyone from the ad by 
the way. ALBUMREVIEWS

FILMREVIEW▶ HEALTH, MYVTWHNL‘We Can Do It
Anywhere’
The newest album from 
Brit-rockers Editors should serve as a poster child for 
the grim side of taking a risk, when ambition goes awry and experiments turn ugly. Perhaps seeking to deviate from their formulaic yet wildly successful UK chart-topping imitation of similarly dark alt-rock groups like Interpol and U2, In This Light and On This Evening  
jettisons glitzy guitar riffs for monotonous synthesizers scrubbed of the edgy pizzazz that characterized their earlier work. 
Lead singer Tom Smith’s 
lyrics, delivered in a crystal-clear drone that only heightens its banality, achieves torturous levels of incoherence on nearly all nine interminable tracks. Long stretches of bland synth-bass noodles underline both the poor editing and conspicu-ous underuse of guitars that made Editors’ previous two albums a pleasurable, if rather predictable, listen. The soar-ing emotional power present in bygone Editors classics like “Smokers Outside The  Hospital 
Doors” and “Munich” is lack-ing in wannabe anthems like “Y ou Don’t Know Love” — a static and mechanical cut that personifies everything subpar about Evening . There are a 
handful of bright spots, like “Papillon” — Smith’s stand-and-deliver hook paired with slickly up-tempo drums and synthesizers to make it a stand-out track — but these flashes of brilliance are obscured under the rest of the album’s sludge. Editors tried to change the game with Evening , but all they 
come up with is 45 minutes of depressing gunk.

UK Synth-perimentGo Awry
Ringo Starr
Y Not

Ringo Starr is too damn busy to 
write you an autograph.
He’s got too much on his 
plate — peace and love, folks. He’s busy singing indie-soft over a col-lection of wannabe chart-toppers. Stuffed with disco synths and sweet, meaningless nothings, it’s hard to tell whether  Y Not is a revitalizing sound 
for the 70-year-old former Beatle or a delayed midlife crisis.
Take duet “Walk With Y ou. ” It’s 
an airy love song with fellow Beatle Paul shoved ignominiously into the background, muddling through predictable rhymes and gimme-an-Emmy sentimentality. After that, we’re in for a barrage of tracks like “Everyone Wins” — peacenick anthems, bizarrely set to Alanis Morissette melodies. 
If you can stomach that sug-
ary stupidity, though, Ringo comes through with ZZ Top blues like “The Other Side of Liverpool. ” This streetwise track is vintage blues-rock, matching down-on-your-luck lyrics with a wobbly guitar with a wailing organ. It’s a refreshing change, and you can hear Ringo’s smile as he lays down some catchy blues. The ridicu-lously named “Who’s Y our Daddy” is a tongue-in-cheek throwback to “R.E.S.P .E.C.T., ” with soul singer Joss Stone guest-starring as the had-enough liberated woman kicking a deadbeat Starr to the curb.
There are only four blues num-
bers, though, and  Y Not sinks with 
Ringo’s attempt at the fame game. The clock’s ticking for the septua-genarian, and unless he cranks out more like “The Other Side, ” he’ d have been better off sticking with Thomas the Tank Engine.

It seemed like the Minneapolis 
boys of Motion City Soundtrack were finally on the verge of some 
serious radio play: They moved to a fancy label, snagged a veteran pow-er-chord virtuoso Mark Hoppus as co-producer and cranked their Moog synthesizer to a nearly unbearable blast. 
Unfortunately, the bubblegum 
pop on My Dinosaur Life  is little 
more than an overproduced rehash of the band’s limited repertoire: fast-paced, hyper-lyrical storytelling, climaxing in butter-smooth cries of self-loathing and forced irony. With a hotshot producer on board, you’ d think they’ d ease up on the high-school poetry (“There’s a buzz/ There’s a buzz/ There’s a buzzing of bugs”) and indulge in the kind of melodic simplicity that made their first efforts — “Feels Like Rain, ” “The Future Freaks Me Out” — so freewheeling. Instead, we get a haggard Justin 
Pierre bitching about pharmaceutical evils, something about a tourniquet, dinosaurs and dreams. Notable exceptions to their nonsensical bab-bling are “Skin and Bones, ” which employs jumpy repetition to rival Fall Out Boy, and “Stand Too Close, ” paring down every song’s obnoxious synth layers and cutting to recall a bit of their original simplicity. 
By far the stupidest track is 
“@!#?@!” (Did I get that right? Am I missing an octothorpe?), which is apparently what Pierre was thinking of when he described the album as “edgy”: “Y ou all need to go away, you motherfuckers/ Y ou all need to leave me and my homeboys alone. ” Really. And the rest is so forgettable that it’s better left as background music to the next episode of “Gossip Girl. ”

This Florida band’s name might sound like a late-
night B-movie, but the debut album from Surfer Blood is just as velvet-soft and vox-dominated 
as anything by the Shins or the Smiths. These indie-rockers are so new, they don’t even have a Wikipedia page (I admit it, I looked), but they’re already knee-deep in dust — covered in such a film that five min-utes after you turn off your iPod, you’ve forgotten everything but a five-second lick.
Linchpin of their sudden popularity “Swim” 
starts off with a catchy hook and Benatar-esque power chords, but the riffs start rambling halfway through, and the track drowns in distortion. The vocals echo so long, it’s like bad karaoke: The chorus is the only time we can make out the words.
Astro Coast  does serve up a few clean cuts, 
especially “Neighbour Riffs, ” an instrumental with ringing guitars much like Eric Johnson’s “Cliffs of Dover. ” Other than that, though, the only bright sides are “Take It Easy” and closer “Catholic Pagans. ” We can hear the lyrics, but they still don’t make much sense: “Please don’t padlock/ Y our parents’ bomb shelter/” It’s ridiculous, but “Easy”’s tropical toe-tapping groove mesmerizes us into not caring about even the most terrible lyrics.
“Easy” and “Pagans” might get the fuzz-meter 
right, but they can’t save Coast. Surfer Blood did 
record the album in a dorm room, so a little pro-fessional mixing might make all the difference. For now, if we want to spend almost an hour wonder-ing what’s going on, we’ d be better off in the last row of o-chem.

If I wanted to listen to generically crappy indie alt-rock, I’ d cue up Hoobastank. But Spoon is a group we expect a little more out of. Or a lot more. From the same men who 
brought us the awesomely catchy and peculiar Ga Ga Ga Ga 
Ga in 2007, seventh studio record Transference  should have 
been, at the very least, a rung above mediocre.
But Transference  doesn’t transcend anything. It’s like Spoon 
went into the indie-rock handbook and followed a step-by-step formula on how to write a semi-hit. Each cut has an unwaver-ing, steady pace, plodding along without any variety before coming to an abrupt end.
But this isn’t as bothersome as the fact that they all run at 
least a minute too long. This is the A.D.D. Twitter generation;  
how do you expect us to pay attention for an extra minute of bass drum and guitar strums when we get impatient waiting for a Web page to load? 
In its journey to experiment with new genre trends, Spoon 
dabbles with odd echoic Auto-Tune on “Is Love Forever?” and “Who Makes Y our Money. ” As a result, the album’s overall aes-thetic is awfully inconsistent, jumping abruptly from fast-paced feel-good melody “The Mystery Zone” to “Written in Reverse, ”  
a chugging number with somber piano plunks and raw, aggro vocals. 
The LP’s saving grace is “I Saw the  Light, ” which weaves 
smooth vocals and blown-out riffs with calmer ones, and an 
epic buildup  with some “Fuck yeah!” strumming that com-
pletely shifts gears mid-song, keeping our attention spans in check.
For the most part, Spoon plays a crappy version of their 
garage-rock facade, resulting in 11  run-of-the-mill tunes that 
aren’t terrible, but definitely aren’t anything we’ll put on repeat. Guess it’s time to switch to sporks.

to follow a man later identified as Harold Fullmer (Frank Wood) on a train from Chicago to Los Angeles.
Like the average college kid, 
Rosow survives on alcohol and cof-fee, minimal sleep and grudgingly does what he is told. So naturally, he embarks on the cross-county jour-ney without question. On the way, he uncovers Fullmer’s identity as a missing person; one of the thou-sands presumed dead after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 
Tempted by a $500,000 reward, 
he must decide whether or not to bring the missing guy back to his wife in New Y ork City against his will. 
The discovery prompts Rosow to 
explore his own painful memories of the 9/11 tragedy — a dramatic 
tale of love, loss and moral ambigu-
ity — with the help of his assistant and love interest (Amy Ryan), a process that allows him to better understand the reason for Fullmer’s purposefully long absence.
Imbued with black silhouettes 
against a cityscape, a score chock full of jazz and a whole heap of cigarette smoke, Buschel’s work 
is sure to receive more than a few 
accolades for its triumph in cinema-tography, despite its lack in script development. Shannon’s pained and effortlessly cool performance succeeds in earning a few nods and smoothing out the film’s occasional plot fallacies.
The awkwardly sewn together 
9/11 reference is diced with a rather sluggish and anti-climactic plot, leaving Buschel’s creation with a distinct Frankenstein-esque feel: lumbering through with occasion-ally charming characters before fad-ing into smoky, ashen darkness.
While it thankfully strays from 
the normal decorum of a 9/11 script, witty dialogue regarding Chinese food and misunderstood jokes only creates an awkward dichotomy — a film that is unsure about its identity and moral convic-tion.
Buschel’s repeated hurrahs to 
New Y ork locals, while humorous, begs the impression that the direc-tor will, at any moment, burst on to the screen and scream “Where my homeboys at?” Likewise, half-hearted attempts at comedy like Segway riding cops only provide brief moments of relief in an other-wise dull film. 
Buschel’s script is hopelessly 
tame, lacking the action and bone-
chilling mystery we have come to 
expect from a neo-noir film of the last decade.
Nonetheless, “The Missing 
Person” makes a tremendous effort to walk the perilous line between old and new, making it an interest-ing — if largely unsuccessful —addition to the long list of noir that 
precedes it.

mary messenger and assistant for the 
human world, taking leadership of the others (the rest of the people on the ship) and overseeing them as they adapt to the island.
More than a century later, Jack, 
Locke, Kate and all the rest of the important players receive a special visit by Jacob, who pushes them in the direction of the island, ensur-ing their fate on the Oceanic flight. It’s unclear what Jacob intends for these humans — perhaps they have 
more potential than the rest of human-ity, or maybe they’re part lizard and they don’t even real-ize it — but he guides them to the event-chain plane crash that begins “Lost. ”
Going with 
the lizard motif, what if Jack and John’s fathers 
were also part of this reptilian blood-line, hiding out as civilians in human disguises and having children with human females? It would explain a lot about the fathers’ self-destructive, manipulative behavior and why both Christian Shephard and Anthony Cooper (Locke’s dad) can never seem to relate to their children (heck, Anthony even does malicious things like steal Locke’s kidney and push him out of a window). It would also answer why Christian and Anthony both appear on the island as if out of thin air, and why Christian guides Locke to push the underground 
wheel that stops all the wacky time 
travel.
Ultimately, the “Lost” writers have 
an absurd undertaking here. Trying to wrap up all these loose ends and plot holes, they just might need an ancient lizard conspiracy. Y es, it sounds so crazy that I’m not sure I even believe it. But come May, I might be having the last laugh.        ▶ STEEZ, MYVTWHNL<PMWZa"*TIUM

the correct avenues. We are well aware of how 
to work with the administration. ” 
As it stands, only Souder and Campus 
Sustainability Analyst Kristin Hansen hold a permanent office in the center. Students and community members alike are permitted to schedule meetings or events in the center, but are not allowed occupy the space as joint directors.
“I would love to make sure there is really 
good access for anyone that doesn’t exclude everybody, ” Souder said. “We want a space where anyone and everyone feels welcome. Ultimately, we’re running it by my bosses; I want to make sure they’re comfortable. The administration has committed a lot of money and effort, and I want to make sure the uni-versity is happy. ” 
While SSC members are able to reserve the 
SRC for weekly meetings, they are unable to use the center as a main office.
“We have no functional office space or 
meeting place, ” Ghosh said. “There is no pub-lic space where we can display our projects. We can’t put anything on the shelves [in the SRC]. We can’t put anything on the walls. We can only be there at certain hours. We’re forced to run our programs with no central locations. ”
Various programs the SSC is attempting 
to house in the SRC include an extension of the TritonBikes rental program, along with an e-waste drop-off center that would properly dispose of broken electronics. 
“We want to set up an e-waste center, ” 
Ghosh said. “We can’t do that project right now, though, since we have no space to pub-licize to students. We aren’t even allowed to enter the space. ”
Ghosh said that the SSC feels there is even 
difficulty setting up meetings under the cur-rent arrangements. 
“We don’t get preference in the scheduling 
process, ” Ghosh said. “[Souder] can schedule over us if she finds out when our meetings are. She’s treating us as a non-involved third party who she just lets use the space. ” 
Souder holds that the center has been very 
productive and useful during the time it has been open, despite the SSC’s lack of a role in managing the center. “It’s already proven to be great, ” Souder 
said. “The space is already being well-utilized by many, including students, faculty and staff. ” 
The SSC is currently working with the A.S. 
Council to expedite the process to reach an MOU.
“We’ve decided we need to stop negotiat-
ing with [Souder] directly, ” Ghosh said. “Our talks weren’t productive. We were going back-wards. She kept rescinding promises. Now we’re working through A.S. and various vice chancellors, who are her supervisors. They can make it clear an anti-student activity will 
not be tolerated at UCSD. If things don’t go well, we won’t hesitate to meet with the chan-cellor herself. ” 
Gupta said he 
supports the SSC’s efforts to attain a physical place in the SRC.
“The SRC is part 
of A.S., ” Ghosh said. “The students in the SSC are employees of A.S., which is a department of the university. We’re 
going to make sure they’re treated with respect — the same respect any administrator would receive. It should be two departments working together. ” 
Gupta said he intends to re-open discus-
sions between the SSC and CSS, bringing in higher administrators including Souder’s supervisor Assistant Vice Chancellor Russell Thackston. Gupta said he also plans on meet-ing with the University Centers Advisory Board to discuss the current state of the SRC, along with its intended purpose.
“We had met with the University Centers 
Advisory Board, ” Gupta said. “They reviewed the space agreement with the intent that stu-dents were to share in the space. I’ve spoken with the UCAB chair. We’ll be presenting to them sometime in the next few weeks. ”

Ryan was a member of the UCSD swim team 
and swam breaststroke for four years, despite recurring knee injuries. 
“He fought through a lot of injuries while 
he swam, but he never once thought about not swimming, ” Costa said. “The team really meant the world to him, and I think it’s been really hard for a lot of the alumni that swam with him for years. ”  
 In addition to his involvement with the 
swim team, Ryan was also a writer for the Muir 
Quarterly , a satirical newspaper that, according 
to Costa, allowed him to showcase his sense of humor. 
“He had this sarcastic humor that was really 
quick — really witty, ” Costa said. “When we were freshmen, he and a few of the other swim guys used to sneak into our apartment while we were at dinner and invert all of our furniture. This happened a few times before we actually figured out who it was. ” 
The Kloos family has asked that any dona-
tions in Ryan’s memory be made to Friends of the Orphans at 1-888-201-8880 or www.friendsoft-
heorphans.org, in honor of Erin and Ryan Kloos.
“Ryan just showed a lot of love to everyone 
around him, ” Costa said. “He loved his family, he loved his school, he loved his chosen career path and he showed that every day; it’s kind of that feel for life that we’re all hanging on to. ” 
Ryan’s family is currently at a Miami hospital 
with his sister Erin, who was also injured in the quake. She is now in stable condition.
“Knowing my son, Ryan, for only 24 years is 
so much better than never having known him at all, ” John Kloos said. “No son has ever made his family prouder. ”

the council — including VP Student Life, VP 
Finance and AVP Concerts and Events — as well as the Graduate Student Association president and UCAB chair. 
In contrast, Taylor’s version allowed for the 
current UCAB governing board — composed of members of the six college councils, as well as administrators and alumni — to review the funds appropriated to the Loft. 
Gupta said he was pushing for the maximum 
amount of student oversight, especially because UCAB is known for being under the administra-tive thumb.
“When you’re deciding where to place hun-
dreds of thousands of student fees collected every quarter every year, you better put it in a place that can perform effective and real over-sight, ” he said. “I do not feel comfortable in placing these fees with the University Centers Advisory Board.” 
Taylor said that UCAB was capable of reg-
ulating the Loft’s finances because members had experience dealing with student fees — as opposed to the as-of-yet nonexistent Loft Governance Board. 
“UCAB is a fully functioning board, not a 
committee, ” he said. “We control a $10 million budget, most of it in student fees. ”
The UCAB model of the referendum passed 
by a vote of 16-11-3, due to concerns that the oversight provided by Gupta’s model was excessive. 
Loft Director Martin Wollesen said the night’s 
debate was valuable, and praised the council’s deci-sion to place the referendum on the ballot. 
“There was comparable evidence — from 
attendance records to signatures to A.S. ’s own surveys — that the students want to be able to vote, ” Wollesen said. “I would have been disap-pointed if A.S. didn’t listen to the student voice. ”
If passed, the fee would go into effect Fall 
Quarter 2010 and be charged every quarter until Spring Quarter 2014 — at which point it would terminate unless renewed by a majority A.S. Council vote.

firm hold on proceedings, especially 
early on, as evidenced by the 33 ties in the match — eight of which occurred in the first set. The Tritons trailed behind 3-0, but quickly turned things around to take the lead 8-7 with a kill from Kiani. UCSD and UCSB went back and forth until the Tritons ultimately claimed the first set 27-23, due to a Gaucho error. Junior middle blocker Adrian Guthals’ kill sealed the set at 30-26.
In the second set, the Gauchos 
jumped out to an 11-6 lead, until the Tritons fought back to 12-10. However, UCSB was able to stave off the comeback attampt, and ultimately claimed the second set with a 30-24 victory.
The Tritons started out on top in 
the third set with a 10-6 lead, thanks to a block from Fritsch and junior middle blocker Calvin Ross. UCSB fought back to tie the set at 18-18 until UCSD scored four straight points topped off with an ace from Ross to lead 22-18.
But the Gauchos fought 
on, and tied the set at 27-27. Fortunately for the Tritons, two errors from UCSB and a Ross kill were enough to hand them the set at 27-30.
In the fourth set, UCSB 
broke the 11-11 tie to take a 20-15 lead. The Tritons worked to bring the score to 25-24, minimizing the Gaucho’s lead to only one point. Despite the Tritons’ best efforts, they lost the set 30-27.
In the fifth and final set, the Tritons started off with a 9-8 lead, but could not improve on their .095 
attack percentage as the Gauchos hit at a .316 clip. UCSB eventually sealed a 15-13 win, ending the match in its favor.
“In the match [against 
UCSB], we were better at passing, ” head coach Kevin Ring said. “Due to that, we played better offensively and [kept] a more balanced attack. ”
The loss against 
UCSB followed UCSD’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation sea-son opener at No. 2 Cal State Northridge 
on Wednesday, Jan. 13. There, the Tritons were defeated 30-24, 30-26 and 30-28 at the hands of the Matadors, extending their win-less streak against Northridge to 35 matches.
The Tritons were outhit by the 
Matadors .320 to .174. Fritsch led the way for the Tritons with 16 kills on .33 hitting. Spangler had seven kills. Bannan offered 29 assists, five digs and four kills in the game. Guthals led the team with six blocks and five kills on .625 hitting. Freshman libero Chase Frishman had a team-high eight digs in the game.
Fritsch tied the first set at 16-16 
with a kill. However, Cal State Northridge won the first set with a score of 30-24.
The Tritons scored the first three 
points of the second set. With the score tied 14-14, both teams battled until the Matadors topped the Tritons and won the set 30-26.
In the closely fought third set, 
Bannan sent a kill to tie the set at 23-23. After the Matadors cruised to a two-point lead, the Tritons retied the set at 26-26 through an ace from Spangler. Moments later, Fritsch sent down a kill to again tie the set at 28-28. At the end of the dramatic set, Cal State Northridge claimed the set victory at 30-28 with a kill and block.
“For the next match, we need 
to continue passing well, ” Ring said. “In order for us to be competitive, we need to sideout with more con-sistency. ”
The Tritons will return to action on 
Jan. 20 against Pepperdine University before heading to Los Angeles to play University of Southern California on Jan. 22.

Evans is shining for a Kings team 
that is, as Charles Barkley would say, “turrible” beyond belief. If there is any truth to the Sacramento Kings move to San Jose rumors, Evans might be play-ing in my hometown sometime soon.
Honorable Mention: the Warrior’s 
Stephen Curry.
Monta Ellis said it couldn’t be 
done, but he and Stephen Curry have been tearing up the backcourt for the Warriors lately — even if the rest of the team is struggling to bring Golden State out from the cellar. But seriously, what were the Warriors thinking, let-ting Ellis answer questions about Curry without prepping him first? Have you heard the man talk? He can run faster than most of the league, but put him in front of a mic and he’s slower than Bengie Molina rounding first base.
 Still, Monta came around once 
Stephen Curry got in the rhythm of things. On Monday against the Bulls, Curry had 26 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. And his outside shot that brought him to stardom in college is starting to show up in the pros — Curry hit five tres against the Bulls.
I just realized I got through this 
whole NBA column without men-tioning everyone’s favorite star: Kobe Bryant.

In last year’s historic season, the 
Tritons posted a 27-9 overall record, 
including a perfect 16-0 record at home during conference play. The stretch included a four-game sweep of then-No. 1 Cal State Stanislaus.
UCSD claimed its second 
California Collegiate Athletic Association championship and won the CCAA tournament, defeating Sonoma State University. The victo-ries vaulted the team to No. 2 in the country in Division-II.  
After advancing past the NCAA 
West Regional, the Tritons reached the D-II College World Series in Cary, North Carolina for the first time ever, where they won two games before bowing out in the National Semifinal against Emporia State University.
After playing an underdog role 
for much of last season, being on top of the the preseason rankings this year gives the Tritons a new perspective.
“We like to say that our oppo-
nents are nameless and faceless, ” Rossman said. “We’re not worried about who we’re playing or what they’re ranked.  Everyone is going to be gunning for us this year. ”
Hoisting a target on their back, 
UCSD is looking to replace key cogs from last year’s squad. The Tritons lost the program’s all-time hits leader Garrett Imeson, all-time home-runs leader Matt Cantele and all-time wins leader Trevor Decker to graduation.
The team will also have to replace 
now assistant coach Josh Tanner, a .419 career hitter.An influx of younger players and 
transfers will fill the voids, leaving it up to the returnees to keep the fresh faces grounded despite the hype.
“There will be times that we 
will have to deal with adversity and how we respond will be big, ” senior shortstop and preseason All-America Vance Albitz said. “Losses will definitely happen, and how we deal with them will come down to how the older guys act. We have been around a couple years and have seen it. ”
Junior pitcher and All-American 
Tim Shibuya believes that the pre-season accolades will help the team.
“Psychological warfare: It’s an 
honor that I don’t take lightly, ” he said. We can use it against other teams. When teams come to play us, we have an advantage. ”
According to Shibuya, success in 
the new season won’t be so much about talent and fundamentals, but will depend more on the players’ ability to gel as a team and conquer the often overlooked mental aspects of baseball.
“Last year we came together so 
much as a team that we were playing as a unit, ” Shibuya said. “Every team hits and pitches; mental things are going to separate us. ”
UCSD will open the season with 
18-straight home games at Triton Field, where the team lost only three times last season. The stretch includes a pair of preseason ranked opponents: No. 18 Western Oregon in non-conference play, and No. 22 Chico State to open up the CCAA.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The No. 
11-ranked UCSD men’s volleyball 
team traveled to UC Santa Barbara on Saturday, Jan. 16, to play its second match this season in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation campaign. The Tritons were unsuccessful in securing their first victory in a very close seesaw match against the No. 14-ranked Gauchos. UCSD lost with a final score of 26-30, 30-24, 27-30, 30-27 and 15-13.
This was the fourth consecutive 
meeting between the two teams where the winner was decided in five sets. However, it was the first time that the Gauchos were victorious in the matches. The loss dropped the Tritons to 0-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and 1-4 overall.
Leading the way for UCSD was 
senior outside hitter Jason Spangler, who registered 15 kills and seven digs. Freshman middle blocker Cyrus Kiani also contributed with 12 kills on .625 hitting. Junior setter Phil Bannan had a double-double with 52 assists and 10 digs. Senior opposite hitter Frank Fritsch slammed 11 kills and junior outside hitter Joel Davidson added nine kills. 
UCSB was led by outside hitter Jeff 
Menzel who finished with 25 kills, and opposite hitter Cullen Irons with 14 kills. <PM;KWWX"

It’s mid-January, and even San 
Diego has shown some signs of “winter, ” leaving its residents 
comically unprepared for the rain. So it’s time to talk football, right? Well, I’ve never been one to follow trends — heck, I’ve been a Warriors fan since before their “We Believe” days — and I refused to jump on the Chargers’ bandwagon this year. Let’s face it, after Nate Kaeding’s glorious suck-fest on Sunday, the last thing you want to hear is predictions for an AFC Championship game to which the Chargers so brilliantly botched their ticket.
So instead, here are a few of my 
midseason NBA awards. We’ll see if they have any relevance by the time summer rolls around.
Guy that screwed over his team the 
most: the Wizard’s Gilbert Arenas 
To be fair, Agent Zero’s biggest 
crime was being too serious a practi-cal joker. In fact, we should applaud how committed he is to punking his teammates. I’m talking, of course, about bringing unloaded guns into the locker room and, alongside Javaris Crittenton, pointing them at each other. Maybe bringing in the guns and then joking about it later (Arenas and his teammates drew more attention to the scandal by making guns out of their hands on the sidelines) wasn’t as hilarious as they thought.
One thing I’ve learned from all 
of this: If I ever see a professional athlete out on the streets, I’m gonna make sure to be extra careful about what I say. Arenas was by no means packing light — accompanying his .50 caliber gold-plated semiautomatic was a .500 magnum revolver, a .45 mm semiautomatic and a 9 mm. Who knows what would happen if he went all Plaxico Burress on us and loaded all his guns into his sweatpants? Four shots in the leg and indefinite sus-pension wouldn’t have been the only thing that ruined his season.
Surprise Team of the (Mid) Y ear: 
Oklahoma City Thunder
Loyal readers know that I dedi-
cated my last column to picking apart the Sonicsgate fiasco from a couple of years ago that sent the Sonics to Oklahoma City. But the Thunder has really stepped up its game, thanks to third-year forward Kevin Durant. The former Rookie of the Y ear has led the team to 23 wins this season in half the time it took all its players combined last year. Durant has exceeded already high expectations for the year, aver-aging 29.1 points per game and 7.1 rebounds. Second-year point guard Russell Westbrook isn’t too shabby either, putting up 16.1 points and 7.5 assists per game.
The Thunder is definitely not 
perfect — the team ranks in the top five in turnovers. But considering the nucleus of young players, they should start handling the ball better soon — hopefully in time to make a push for 
the playoffs this season.
Rookie of the (Mid) Y ear: the King’s 
Tyreke Evans.
It’s a close tie with Brandon 
Jennings’ ghetto ass, but Evans has 
been playing well of late and looks to be getting even better. The 20-year-old is averaging 20.8 points per game for the Kings, and has all the qualities of a =+;,.ITT[

BIG CLEATS TO FILLBy Yvonne Chow
Staff Writer
FENCING — The best fencers on the western North American coast — from Canada to San Diego — gathered in San Jose from Jan. 15 to Jan. 18 to compete for continental supremacy in the 
North American Cup.
The tournament featured over 260 competitors, 
and presented a wide range of competition for the UCSD fencers.
“This tournament really served to challenge and 
expose our athletes with world-class level fencing, ” head coach Heidi Runyan said.
However, Runyan felt the timing of the tourna-
ment was not favorable for the team, since it’s prox-imity to the recent BladeRunner tournament didn’t give the team enough time to recover or adjust their techniques. 
“We would have preferred if it came longer after 
the Christmas break, ” Runyan said.
The tournament — structured in knock-out 
format — pitted players into groups of six or seven. Then, the competitors faced each other for top spots in the group. The group’s highest scorers were then placed into direct elimination rounds.
Despite the tournament’s inopportune timing and 
stiff competition, the UCSD fencers performed well.
Triton sophomore  Michael Fong continued to 
find success in only his second year fencing, and placed 22nd out of 195 participants  in the junior 
men’s foil. Fong has already placed second at the UC Irvine Collegiate Open and 5th at the BladeRunner Tournament this year. His finish marks a 22-spot improvement over his performance at last year’s NAC, where he placed 44th  out of 188. 
Fong said that fencers come from all over North 
America to compete at NACs and the quality of the field is incredible.
“The competition is always fierce at NAC, ” he 
said.  “It’s typical to fence against Olympians and world team members.  
UCSD now looks ahead to the Northwestern 
Duals that will take place in Evanston from Jan. 30 to Jan. 31.

BASEBALL — The UCSD baseball team is entering 
the upcoming 2009-10 season ranked as the No. 1 team in the nation in Division-II by Ping!Baseball, and No. 3 by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper.
The team also boasts three Division-II preseason 
All-Americans — designations given to the best players in the country in their respective positions — as voted by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association.
All this, on the heels of a record-breaking 2008-

tions, however, the team is taking a workman’s atti-tude to the upcoming season.
“Last season was arguably one of the best seasons
