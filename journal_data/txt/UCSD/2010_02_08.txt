State Senator Proposes 10-Percent Cap on Fee Hikes
By Angela Chen
News Editor
In light of the highly protested November 
student-fee fee increase, state Sen. Jeff Denham 
(R-Merced) introduced new legislation Jan. 29 aimed at preserving accessibility to public high-er education. 
The Student Protection Act SB 917 would 
cap any future student-fee hikes at 10 percent, as well as require University of California and California State University officials to provide an 180-day waiting period between the approval of tuition increases and the date on which stu-dents begin to pay the hike. 
There is no such waiting period at this time; 
the 32-percent fee increase approved by the UC Board of Regents last November went into effect at the beginning of Winter Quarter. According to Denham’s press secretary, Jan 
Taber, the senator introduced similar legislature in 2004, but it was not passed by the state senate. 
Denham was inspired to reintro-duce the legislature in November after he heard the regents were planning to raise student fees by 32 percent. 
“He thought it was ridiculous, ” 
Taber said. “He decided to intro-
duce legislation because he feels strongly that students and parents should have time to plan if there’s a fee increase and avoid large, unexpected increases midway through school. ”
Tabor said Denham 
believes the recent increases are keeping stu-dents from graduating, or at least from graduating on time. 
According to Leslie 
Sepuka, media special-ist at the University of California Office of the President, UCOP is con-cerned that a student-fee cap could negatively impact the quality of a UC education. 
“In the past, [the UC 
system] has been con-cerned that student-fee caps could threaten [the UC system’s] ability to preserve the quality of the institution, ” Sepuka said. 
For example, if the state were to cut the 
UC budget by another 20 percent — but the university was unable to raise fees by more than 10 percent — enrollment and courses may have to be reduced even more than they already have been. 
Sepuka added that the timing of the state 
budget’s release would make it difficult for the university to provide a 180-day waiting period between a tuition increase and its implementa-tion. 
“We have regularly notified parents and 
students about the state budget situation and the likelihood of fee increases, ” she said. “However, the timing of a state budget and funding deci-sions could prevent [the UC system] from keep-ing by a six-month deadline. ”
In place of raising student fees, Denham 
suggested in his proposal that the UC system sell its off-campus properties;  most notably, the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research

After encountering difficulties over con-
tract negotiations, students and staff are final-
ly making headway in the fight for joint own-ership of the Sustainability Resource Center.
Members of the Student Sustainability 
Collective and administrators from the Campus Sustainability Staff met with Assistant Vice Chancellor Russell Thackston on Feb. 3, with students hoping to draw up a contract that would give both groups equal access to the center.
Students approached administrators two 
years ago about creating a space like the SRC to consolidate sustainability efforts around campus. 
The university provided funding for the 
center through the Green Initiative Fund, and SRC opened its doors last November. 
However, the SSC and CSS have been pro-
hibited by Campus Sustainability Coordinator Maggie Souder from using the space. Souder has continually pushed back the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, which is a legal document used to outline the SRC’s terms of use. 
In the interim, students have not been 
allowed shared ownership of the space.
The Feb. 3 meeting cleared lines of com-
munication between the two parties, whose discussions had come to a standstill after numerous disputes over the terms of the MOU.
Thackston will mediate negotiations 
between the two parties by comparing both 
their MOU proposals and finding a suitable 
compromise.
“[The SSC] has agreed to share with 
me  [their] preferred version of the MOU, ” Thackston said in a statement. “I’ll com-Org heads and admin. expect 
to settle the space-sharingconflict by Week 10.<*)<+.,;*90:0:65,3,.0:3(;69(+=6*(;,:(--69+()030;@

UCSD researchers have found a 
way to keep brain tumors from com-
ing back after remission.
Scientists discovered that a 
gene called KLHDC8 — or SΔE-1 — inhibits the therapeutic drugs designed to halt the growth of a deadly, rapidly developing form of brain tumor known as a glioma. 
After this gene is removed, brain-
tumor patients have less chance of relapse. The discovery could help in the prevention and treatment of can-cer by allowing doctors to target the tumors on a genetic level.
Under the current protocol of 
attacking cancerous tumors, doctors are forced to increase treatments — such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy — because their effectiveness decreases over time. However, these treatments can be toxic at high lev-els, and have adverse effects on the patients.Researchers began investigating 
why patients would respond to drugs and then relapse. They removed the known fuel for cancer growth, a pro-tein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in experiments on mice.
“When you’re looking 
at cancer and you want to target the cancer with a therapeutic [drug], you really need to know if the molecule that you’re targeting is required by the tumor to con-tinue to grow, ” said Frank Furnari, asso-ciate adjunct professor at the UCSD School of Medicine.
By removing EGFR, scientists 
found it to be one of the main factors in starting, developing and maintain-ing gliomas. However, they discov-ered that — though the tumor would stop at first, and the mice would appear to recover — the cancer con-tinued growing without the help of EGFR. There had to be something else causing tumor growth, they con-cluded. 
The second factor was found to 
be KLHDC8 — present in high 
volumes in gliomas when 
EGFR was gone. The 
gene was deactivat-
ing the drugs that 
were trying to 
prevent tumor 
growth. 
Glioma treat-
ment would thus 
need to target both EGFR 
and KLHDC8 in order to curb the growth of cancer. 
“If you could treat with an EGFR 
receptor inhibitor, and you can treat with something that prevented the relapse, you might have a lon-ger response [to tumor growth], ” Webster Cavenee, professor of medicine at the UCSD School of 
Medicine, said.
If it can be proved that other 
types of cancer use KLHDC8 as a replacement for the EGFR removed by current cancer treatments, then Cavenee and Furnari’s discovery can be used to study other tumors. 
Currently, the research lab is 
looking to see how KLHDC8 is working with other genes to cause tumor growth without the help of EGFR, and how these other genes are individually contributing to tumor growth. They will also be looking at possible chemical compounds that can tackle these genes.
“What we found really leaves 
the groundwork for new ways to approach therapy, and to get around this problem of resistance to targeted drugs and brain tumors, ” said Jill Wykosky, a postdoctoral fellow who worked on the experiment along with Akitake Mukasa.

JEFF DENHAM
California state senator, R-Merced
STATE NEWS —  On Jan. 29, state 
Sen. Jeff Denham (R-Merced) 
announced a bill to cap UC tuition hikes at 10 percent, annually. Although Denham claims his bill will alleviate our financial burden, it’s only a thinly veiled plan to expand the government’s power over UC operations. 
The Student Protection Act SB 
917 proposes restrictions on the 1960 Donahoe Higher Education Act SB 33 — which grants the regents the power to make any changes they feel will help the university. 
The Donahoe act also granted 
state-college systems full indepen-dence from political influences. Restricting these existing provi-sions would force the UC Board of Trustees to wait 180 days before implementing a fee hike, and cap the hike at 10 percent — giving the state go
vernment more control over 
the UC system, always a dangerous inlet for outside political interests. However well intentioned, the bill lacks specifics fo
r implementation, 
and does not offer any sustaining solutions to our budget problems.  
Capping fee increases is a great 
idea, theoretically. States such as New Jersey and Arizona have capped annual tuition hikes at 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, while Maryland has implemented a full tuition freeze on state colleges. But there’s one giant reason that California is different: Each of those state-college systems supports no more than 10 public universities; California supports 33. With respon-sibility for so many more students and drastically fewer state funds, the fee cap is a one-size-fits-all solution that doesn’t account for California’s more intricate maze of higher-educa-tion pathways and the varying ways in which they are financed.
Alongside steady decreases in 
state funding, tuition caps could severely damage the university’s abil-ity to operate efficiently and offer a reputable education to all its stu-dents. Recent budget cuts have forced UC campuses to cut enrollment, administer layoffs, increase class sizes and slash student services. It doesn’t matter if the bill makes tuition more affordable for students — if there’s no 
funding from the state, and no fund-
ing from the students, our university will dwindle to nothing.
In response to such concerns, 
Denham proposed that the UC sys-tem become more “fiscally respon-sible” and sell off its “vacation villas” in Hawaii and Tahiti. Should these island-fantasy resorts actually exist, one would think a mass student 
protest would have already erupted 
outside UC President Mark Yudof ’s office. However, upon further inquiry, it seems that the UC land in Hawaii and Tahiti is being used for research purposes (for example, UC Berkeley’s Gump station for terres-trial and marine life is located on the Tahiti patch. Not exactly a locale for beachside Mai Tai-sipping.)
Why Denham would mislead 
the public into believing that the UC system is secretly maintaining tropical island vacation villas isn’t entirely clear. Perhaps it’s easier to make it seem that Yudof and the regents have been hiding a big, expensive secret from all of us than it is to find a way to provide the UC with state funding. 
Denham also suggested selling 
off the UC Institute for Mexico and the United States, a research center for foreign policy. Though it would be nice to see university higher-ups sacrifice their precious research institutes for undergraduate afford-ability once in a while, Denham has no inside experience with particular aspects of the UC research universe, and is obviously just name-dropping the one that seems most random to 
him as an instant fix-it.
The senator’s uninformed sug-
gesting are further evidence that he’s 
less interested in protecting students than he is in pushing his frustration at the situation toward the regents, meanwhile giving a charitable sheen to his reputation. 
It’s easy to forget that the univer-
sity’s research sites provide all UC students a more valuable degree, along with the opportunity to intern. And on a larger, humanitarian level, research-lab discoveries are crucial in moving our nation and planet respectably and sustainably into the 21st century.
We are, as Yudof often reminds 
us, a well-established research 
institution. Denham’s half-baked proposal to sell off UC properties — nowhere has he even floated rough estimates as to how much revenue their sale would 
generate — is 
much more an emotional reaction to fee hikes than a helping hand to institutional success.
 Denham and his fellow state 
legislators must understand that the 
rising cost of tuition is only half of 
public higher education’s problem. Degree options are being slashed, lecture halls overfilled, library hours shortened and student services eliminated. The real root of our 
downfall lies in the lack of adequate voter support and legislative priority — which Denham’s bill does noth-ing to correct. 
The only effective “Student 
Protection Act” would be one guar-anteeing continual state funding for higher education — the only way 
the UC and CS
U systems will be 
able to sustain themselves without resorting to tuition hikes. 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in 
fact, has already proposed restoring $305 million to the university’s bud-get for next ye
ar. In addition, in his 
latest State of the State address, he proposed amending the California Constitution to ensure that public universities will receive no less than 10 percent of the total state gen-eral fund. And while both of those proposals may wind up being little more than pipe dreams, they’re far more productive than taking away 
the regents’ rights to sucks us dry.
Denham’s proposal doesn’t pro-
vide feasible solutions to ensure the 
quality of our education; it’s more a transparent ploy to make the govern-ment look like the good guy — and, if our failed state economy is much of an indicator, we’re not necessar-ily in better hands with the state of California advising our finances.

Between my debaucherous New 
Y ear’s Eve and the caffeine-induced haze of midterms, I’ve 
come to an eye-opening conclusion: There’s no use in venturing to com-mit to any kind of grand, life-chang-ing New Y ear’s resolution anymore. At least not for me.
This year’s empty promise — to 
get to the gym more often — seemed doable enough. But try though I might to manage the two-minute walk to RIMAC from my apartment, I’m perpetually exhausted. It’s a bone-chilling 65 degrees out, and the five-pound box of Nutter Butters gracing my living room (love you, Grandma) looks a whole lot more tempting than whatever sweat-drenched treadmill may or may not even be open at the gym.
But — and I say this with all the 
seriousness of a vindictive nun — despite the fact that it’s Week Six and I still haven’t made it to the weight room, I’m not a lost cause, and nei-ther are you. There’s another oppor-tunity for self-improvement creeping around the corner next Wednesday: a little 40-day vacation from self-indulgence called Lent.
Before provoking any evangelist 
accusations, bear in mind that not only am I not actually Catholic, it’s only a matter of years until I get gay-married before a gathering of pro-choice, Bible-rejecting heathens like myself. (God and the U.S. Supreme Court willing, preferably on Maui. To Anderson Cooper. But we can save that one for another Monday.)
See, amid all the bro-induced mis-
ery of my Catholic-school past, one shining, notably less shitty memory stands out. One of our many high-school traditions (along with the ritualized heckling of disabled kids and the choir) was monthly mass in the gym — a universally dreaded occasion that brought us together in shirt-and-tie solidarity, if not any closer to God. 
Whether it was the visiting Bishop 
Wang (a source of wonder not only for his surname, but also his praise of the “whore-y spirit”) or another preacher who imparted the message a few years back, I can’t be sure. But what I do remember is this: For once, the bishop’s words on Lenten sacrifice (i.e., giving up masturbation or video games, or any other teenage vice, for six weeks) compelled me to focus on something other than the pack of mint Milanos I’ d be devouring within the hour. 
Bishop Wang didn’t want us to 
shelve our PS2 controllers or resist peeking at our dads’ Playboy  collec-
tions for Lent — oh, no. He urged us to go one holy step farther and take up a new habit. Preferably something 
charitable, like feeding the poor or 
leaving the choir boys to sing without shouting “GAY!” mid-chorus. Lent, he insisted, should be seen as an opportunity to bring some positivity into the world — not just to do away with the negative. 
The season of self-improvement 
doesn’t have to be all about getting a  At Wit’s

six-pack, either. There are plenty of 
things most of us don’t do — recycle pizza boxes, eat vegetables, use den-tal dams — and there’s no time like the present for a trial run.
Despite four years of religion 
classes (another memorable teach-ing: that “safe sex” is, in fact, a media-propagated myth), that win-ter morning’s lesson was the only one that really stuck. Think about it: What better instrument for self-betterment could there possibly be than one that gives you an easy out after a few new-and-improved weeks? Why resolve to work out for an entire year — and then feel vaguely guilty for passing the gym on the way for a pint of Ben & Jerry’s — when I can give it a few 
weeks and call it quits, just in time for a proper Easter din-ner? 
Of 
course, I’ve got noth-ing against positivity and charity and saving the children. But what 
I’ve found, after countless failed attempts at this elusive concept called self-improvement, is that not only am I cripplingly lazy, I can’t very well motivate myself to fix any-thing if I’m too overwhelmed by the prospect of getting out of bed before 10 a.m. in the first place. 
That’s why it’s so important to 
start small. Sure, I may not be able to get my ass out of bed before the end of the “The View, ” but I can cer-tainly manage to spend 20 minutes on the elliptical after class through the end of the quarter. Just as long as Beyonce propels me to the exhausting end of mile two, there’s still the promise of return to my comfy sofa (a perfect arm’s length away from that prized cookie box) when Easter finally rolls around.

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana
<PIVS/WLNWZI;MKWVL4Iba/WI\;MTN1UXZW^MUMV\Dear Editor,
It is deplorable that the Guardian  
— which so often follows the stories of environmentally conscious student groups — would take a less-than-green approach to their own organi-zation.
While enjoying my lunch one 
afternoon I noticed a student distrib-uting a new issue of the Guardian. He took the monstrous pile of leftover papers, balanced it atop a trash can and walked to the next stand. I sat there wondering if he would come back, fully expecting him, as a repre-sentative of this paper, to recycle the papers. To my dismay he did return, only to chuck the leftovers into the trash can without hesitation.
I am not a math major or any-
thing but a colossal amount of papers are being wasted every year if this is the normal behavior for your dis-tributors. The each issue is about 12 pages long, and the discarded stack must have numbered 50 papers. Multiply that by all the newspaper stands littering the campus and take into mind that the Guardian  distrib-
utes two times a week — countless thousands of Guardian  issues must 
be rotting in San Diego landfills instead of being recycled.
As a paper that reports on the 
campus’ green initiatives and as members of a society that is increas-ingly promoting environmental awareness, these actions are unac-ceptable. Please look into incorpo-rating recycling practices for your distributors, if not for the student committees you cover or the planet we all live in, then for your integrity as a paper.

ing missionaries who snatched some 33 Haitian preschoolers 
in an effort to herd them to the Dominican Republic, these grown-ups should have wisened to the one basic religious principle: “Thou shalt not traffick children. ” 
It’s a shame that the U.S., which has deployed 20,000 troops to 
aid the earthquake-ravaged nation and raised $555 million in relief funds, is now being slapped on the wrist with a ruler and forced to wear the global dunce cap because of these misguided idiots. We already have a shaky enough international reputation, so this hic-cup by 10 individuals should certainly not be taken as a reflection on our nation as a whole, or on — everyone’s favorite scapegoat — President Barack Obama. 
The accused individuals have argued that a Haitian pastor 
authorized their removal of the ch ildren, signifying that religious 
duty trumps actual law, in their world. But in separating children from their living relatives — the alleged kidnappers failed to real-ize that some of the kids weren’t actually without family. So let it rain on these airheads’ parade — but leave the U.S. government alone, because for once, we’re not the bad guys.
— Kelsey Marrujo   
Senior Staff WriterThe New York Times, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC all have 
one thing in common — they’ve each published over two 
dozen articles on the 10 American Baptists. And while the inci-dent was indeed newsworthy, the degree to which the press has focused in on this issue is detracting from the larger problem at hand: Haiti is in a crisis.
The country’s death toll has risen to 212,000, and those who 
survived last month’s earthquake face grave conditions. By giv-ing so much attention to the 10 Americans that may or may not have abducted a group of Haitian children, the press is drawing our eyes away from what truly matters: aiding the country in its relief efforts.
Instead of reporting on whether or not the 10 Americans 
will be able to make bail, the greater focus must be on helping repair the hundreds of thousands of lives that have been devas-tated by the natural disaster. Pushing ourselves into the interna-tional spotlight in the face of foreign tragedy isn’t only absurdly self-centered; it’s unfair to the nation whose recovery will be a long and grueling process yet.
— Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor  Ten Americans who tried to take 33 Haitian children across the border to the Dominican Republic have been charged 
with abduction and criminal association — and while they’re clearly in the wrong, it should be obvious they were acting out of naive idealism, not calculated evil.
The detainees, most of whom are Baptist missionaries from 
Idaho, claim they wanted to take the children to what they described as an orphanage. But Haitian officials say the group lacked the proper documents to transport the children out of the country.
All 10 of the detainees were so ridiculously unaware that 
they were doing something unlawful that they said they were surprised when they were detained by Haitian Laura Silsby, the group’s leader, and even asked that they be released and allowed to continue their work in Haiti.
Y et there seems to be a deeper story to all this.Maybe no one had malicious intentions. But while nine of 
the group’s members did not know that official paperwork was needed to cross the border, Silsby was, in fact, warned that she could be charged with trafficking if she tried to take children out of Haiti without documentation.
Why did she go through with it, and how was she able to 
convince the rest of the group to go along with her? The only reasonable answer: a starry-eyed dream of bringing abandoned children to safety. Except that not all of them were actually abandoned. Sure, the groups actions were irresponsible, but it looks like Silsby’s prior knowledge of Haitian regulations might get the rest of the group off the hook.

pare it to the [students’] proposed 
MOU, and follow up with another meeting with the SSC representa-tives. ”
The students’ appeal to 
Thackston was not their first attempt to negotiate a space agree-ment with administrators. SSC members have previously met with Associated Students Advisor Lauren Weiner, University Centers Director Paul Terzino and Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary Ratcliff for guidance on how to approach the situation. 
“We sought advice from high-er level administration on how to proceed with the situation, ” SSC Student Director Rishi Ghosh said. “They were very helpful and made sure not to side with anyone, but just offer advice. ”
Both parties also met with the 
University Centers Advisory Board on Jan. 25 to air their concerns regarding the MOU.
UCAB encouraged the two 
groups to resolve the matter by Week 10.
“The consensus was that if there 
was still dispute after 10th week, they would be more strict with the lease and apply more pressure, ” Ghosh said.According to Ghosh, members 
of the SRC say the organization is incorrectly leased under the depart-ment of External and Business Affairs and is more appropriate-ly categorized under the depart-ment of Resource Management and Planning. 
The organization plans to peti-
tion to change the lease to be under Vice Chancellor of Resource Management and Planning Gary Matthews, who oversees the same department Thrackston works for. 
As an incentive to move discus-
sions along, UCAB members said they will not transfer the lease until the dispute is entirely resolved.
Both parties agreed that 
Thackston’s new role in MOU nego-tiations has accelerated and facili-tated the process.
“We’re moving forward at a much 
faster rate now, ” Ghosh said.
Thackston was also optimistic.“I’m confident that with more dis-
cussion — and willingness on every-one’s part to be flexible in achieving our common vision — we will be able to develop an MOU that provides the framework for a long-term pro-ductive and symbiotic partnership, ” Thackston said.

“It was a chance to help out in 
a nation that was already in poor 
conditions, ” Sloane said. “The sever-ity of the natural disaster called for a worldwide effort. “
Sloane and his colleagues treated 
thousands of patients in partially destroyed hospitals and tents, per-forming intensive surgeries and ampu-tations and treating other injuries.
The influx of patients in the imme-
diate aftermath of the earthquake overwhelmed the available medical care and equipment, much of which had been damaged by the quake. 
According to Sloane, the destruc-
tion soon revealed itself to be worse than anything anyone had predicted. At the Haiti University Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Sloane and his col-leagues were forced to treat patients without the help of resources such as running water, electricity, oxygen, an ICU unit and basic sanitation supplies.
“There was limited medical care, 
limited food and water, ” Sloane said.According to Sloane, even though 
the UCSD Medical Center donated many essential medical sup-plies and pharmaceuticals to the relief effort, these resources were quickly exhausted.
“The situation there was 
really rough, ” Sloane said. “There was so much pain and suffering. [It was hard to see] young people dying from medical illnesses. ”
In the first few days of 
their stay there, the doctors treated almost 200 patients a day. Many patients were treated for wounds that were days old. Fractures and 
infections developed into cases of gangrene and teta-nus, requiring amputation.
Sloane said that patient 
access to medical care might have been hindered due to political strife between local administrations and foreign aid organizations.
 “It was a politically hot topic, ” 
Sloane said. “The administrator in the hospital wanted to be in control, but was ineffective in administering the 
hospital. It took five to six days of negotiating to allow NGOs to help work in the hospital. ”
The power struggle 
prevented critically ill patients from receiving immediate treatment. According to Sloane, the tensions settled over time and outside doctors were allowed in.
Initially, foreign orga-
nizations assumed lead-ership roles and worked alongside Haitian pro-fessionals. As the relief teams trickled out though, Haitian doctors were re-integrated into the system and began assuming their 
original positions. 
“The Haitians were very apprecia-
tive of the help the world gave, ” Sloane said. “They understood the intensity of the situation, and were grateful for the support. ”
Buono, whose five-year-old patient 
Monley Elize drew international media attention when he was rescued after spending eight days under rubble, said she is impressed with the way the Haitian people are handling the situ-ation.
“These people are wonderful peo-
ple — they are willing to help them-selves — but we want to just give them that little bit of boost, because they’ve really been knocked back 10 steps by this earthquake, ” Buono said.
Sloane agreed.“Even with the pain and suffering, 
the Haitian people came across as very strong, ” Sloane said. 
Now, Haiti’s need has switched 
from emergency medical care to reconstruction. Many buildings were destroyed in the quake, leaving hun-dreds of thousands homeless.
Though Sloane has no immediate 
plans to return to Haiti, he said that the International Relief Team will be send-ing more teams to Haiti in the future.

Denham also suggested the 
University of California shut down the UC Institute for Mexico and the United States — or UC Mexus, a Riverside-based organization dedi-cated to doing studies on Mexico. 
“They need to be serving the stu-
dents in California first, ” Taber said. 
Sepuka said it is unlikely that 
either UC Mexus or the Gump Foundation would be closed down, 
as they are integral parts of the University of California. She said the Gump property is a large donation from businessman Richard Gump, who intended that the land be used for scientific research. 
“[The foundation] is probably the 
best value per buck in the UC sys-tem, considering that almost all of the operating budget comes from user fees and external grants, ” Sepuka said.“Plus, the station has brought in millions of dollars for research, including grants from the National Science Foundation and the Moore

INFOCUS DIVAS IN DENIAL XV
Last Saturday, UCSD’s proudest cross-dressing divas and divos 
put their alter-ego stashes of sequin dresses and baggy jeans to good use in the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender 
Queer Intersexual Association’s 15th annual Divas in Denial catwalk extravaganza.
Participating kings and queens shook, sashayed and otherwise 
got low to a packed Price Center West Ballroom. 
Divas in Denial staple Swedish Sapphire (sometimes known as 
Muir College senior Daniel McDonald) passed out tampons and Mardi Gras beads — “But don’t show me your tits,”  he warned, “I don’t want to see them!” — during his Lady Gaga mashup/striptease. 
Comedian Carlos Mencia even made a guest appearance, 
performing standup (word is still out on whether the material was stolen), as did the Little Mermaid, who sang “Wish I could have... a vagina”  to the tune of  “Part of Your World.”
Daughters of Triton — an all-female student singing group 
— was also on hand to belt out acapella renditions of drag-show standards such as Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive,” as w ell as new 
classics like Beyonce’s “Halo.”
The show climaxed with a fashion show that included all the 
performers and any audience members dressed in drag — a fierce finale to close out two hours of good old-fashioned gender-bending.

14-episode campaign to expose 
Jones’ “radical” history.
 Along with being accused of 
signing a petition suggesting that 9/11 was planned by the Bush administration, Jones was cornered about his membership in Socialist International — an umbrella orga-nization of smaller political parties — in the early ’90s. To make mat-ters worse, he was recorded calling Republicans — as well as himself — “assholes” at a UC Berkeley lecture. 
Needless to say, conservative 
assholes were royally pissed — Glenn Beck included. 
While it probably wasn’t the first 
time the party’s members had been called a mean name, the latter com-ment sealed Jones’ resignation on Sept. 6 last year. 
Lucky for us, Jones has since 
gone back to lecturing. 
Peeling off the bestselling suc-
cess of his book The Green Collar Economy, published in 2008, Jones will be joining a long list of speak-ers — including Toni Morrison, Noam Chomsky and Carlos Fuentes — who’ve participated in the Helen Edison Lecture Series, UCSD Extension’s free quarterly talks on humanitarian topics. A nongovernmental organization entrepreneur (he’s started two) and seasoned advocate of whatever your cause, Jones will be speaking on the potential growth of green jobs within the U.S. economy. 
Jones’ talk comes at an appro-
priate time, since the president has made it clear the country is gunning to carve a global niche of green technology in coming years.

improving products to predicting our 
search behavior. He’s known as chief economist at Google, but you might recognize his name from a New York 
Times  business column or your ECON 
100A and 113 textbooks — yeah, he wrote them. Now, Varian will be hold-ing court on campus as part of UCSD’s Economics Roundtable Lecture Series. 
Varian’s lecture — “Predicting the 
Present With Google Trends” — will likely be based on a paper he penned in April 2009 with Hyunyoung Choi, a colleague at Google. In the paper, the two argue that Google searches can often serve as a reliable indicator of current economic activity. 
Y our Varian textbooks will tell you 
that many economic indicators are subject to time lags; for example, a report on this month’s car sales won’t be published until next month. And unemployment rates are based on sur-vey data from past months. 
Google Trends, a section of the 
site, allows you to track keyword searches over time. Varian and Choi believe that if there is a surge in “Prius” searches, for instance, that might indicate a similar surge in Prius sales. Or, if the volume of searches for “unemployment benefits” is decreas-ing, that might indicate a similar decrease in unemployment. 
Y ou won’t know for sure until 
sales reports are published or the joblessness surveys are compiled and analyzed in a study — but, as Varian will likely argue on Feb. 18, analyzing Google searches can help make short-term predictions more accurate when coupled with existing forecast models. This is useful for those who want to get ahead of the market — like inves-tors, or social scientists looking to make their research more precise.
Varian’s lecture, like his paper, will 
probably be full of technical lingo and fancy econometrics — chart- and graph-heavy PowerPoints included. Jargon aside, though, it isn’t too dif-ficult to comprehend his hand in the monopolistic success of Google. During his stint at the company, Varian has overseen a drastic transi-tion in the way Google does business. Instead of selling ad space “Mad Men” style, companies bid for the coveted spots in an electronic auc-tion. The winner is determined by mathematical formulas that also take into account how well the ad matches up with our search terms. This way, when we Google “happy hour,” links to buy Viagra won’t show up in our search results — no matter how much the pharmaceutical companies bid. You can thank Varian for that.

CLUBHOPPING
Ayear after Model United 
Nations at UCSD came togeth-er in 2006, the organization 
was hosting a competition in Eleanor Roosevelt College for over 170 high-school students with a passion for international relations.
When Rebecca Saar — current sec-
retary general, a diplomatic moniker for president — and Vijaya Surampudi joined their freshman year, they decided to head a Home Conference Committee. The team was responsible for hosting the Model United Nations competition for high-school students. 
“We had nothing in common 
— I was in Warren, she was in ERC — except for the fact that we were both really passionate about MUN, ” Surampudi said.
In four short years, MUN at UCSD 
has become a solid leg of the organiza-tion at large, partnering with Eleanor Roosevelt College and hosting its own simulated United Nations debate competition — even earning the title of “best organization” at Eleanor Roosevelt College’s 2007-08 end-of-the-year awards ceremony. 
“When we approached [former] 
Provost [Ann] Craig, she was really excited, ” said Surampudi. “I think she liked that we were showing prospec-tive students how great of a school UCSD was — especially ERC and the political-science department. ”
The two-day conference — com-
plete with guest speakers, a trained staff, complimentary breakfast, an all-day snack bar and a dance to follow the first day’s debate — drew over 200 student participants this year. 
“It’s the fact that we’re trying to 
build UCSD’s reputation as a political-science school — everyone knows it as a science, engineering and tech school, but there’s also a good political-science department that we can represent through MUN, ” said Saar. 
And Home Conference is just 
a small part of the club’s activities. When members aren’t busy hosting competitions, they’re attending similar functions at other universities, drafting resolutions and competing for delega-tion awards (based on a point system measuring each ambassador’s ability to diplomatically cooperate with other member states). This year, MUN at UCSD was invited to Harvard’s annual five-day competition.
“Getting invited to a prestigious 
competition like Harvard’s is amaz-ing — I mean, it’s filled with people who are passionate about international politics, and will be the ones eventu-ally making international policy, ” said Surampudi.

and how it interacted with the reader, the author and the author’s words. 
He shifted from word to action 
by the end of the decade, when he transitioned into performance and video art, continuing his exploration of space through bodily pieces that challenged object-subject relations and public-private distinctions. 
His most famous — and most 
controversial — work, Seedbed (1972), involved Acconci lying under the floor of a gallery, masturbating and speaking his fantasies into a microphone, while the people walk-ing above listened through loud-speakers.
Acconci turned to structural 
design and construction in the 1980s — action to architecture. His instal-lations still relied on audience par-ticipation: In one piece, viewers rode a bicycle to activate machinery that erected the walls of a house. 
In Acconci’s current work, the 
focus on movement within space remains. The architecture and instal-lations of Acconci Studio, founded in 1988, are fluid, organic structures designed for activity and mobility. One of the studio’s most well-known works is an artificial shell-shaped island of glass, steel and blue light floating atop the Mur River in Graz, Austria. It houses a cafe, playground and amphitheater, and is connected to both banks by suspended walkways.
Although his career has evolved 
over various mediums, Acconci’s work can’t hide its literary beginnings. In a winter 2006 interview with writer Shelley Jackson, he described his architecture as a sort of language.
“The rest of the sentence of the 
world still exists, but we make this parenthesis within it. Then maybe sometimes you start the parenthe-sis, but you forget to end it, and the clause instills itself into the real world. ”
Readers can contact Aprille Muscara at 
amuscara@ucsd.edu.Trained as a mathematician, 
Badiou’s philosophical career has largely been a protest against the post-modern craze infatuating wide-eyed students the world over. Refusing to label the current era distinctly “post-modern” like most contemporaries, he’s made more enemies than any intellectual could hope for. 
Badiou’s ideas, some might say, can 
be a bit dense — blending the anti-modernism of Slavoj Zizek (who’s eas-ily more colorful) with contemporary politics while meting out math (and conceptual diagrams) throughout; it’s easy to see how dry seems a fitting adjective — but at least it’s illustrated. 
Though his lectures are usually 
delivered in a wooden, three-word rhythm — punctuated with nodding glances and pages under his palm — it does help us keep up with the momen-tum of his ideas.

SITESEEN
Cigars are pretty 
badass. Gangsters smoke them after 
killing people, billion-aires put them out with wads of money and Bill Clinton uses their tubes to pleasure his interns. Best part is, you too, young college student, can feel the same power and sexual prowess our idols derive from a burn-ing brown stick — all it takes is a short trip to Churchill Cigar Lounge in Old Town.
Though you’ll have to 
stomach Old Town’s faux cowboy decor to get to the dim-lit corner store, its vast inventory of dif-ferent smokes — from strawberry blends to $65 boss-man picks — make it worth the neighbor-hood’s tortilla-plastered streets. 
Even better, if you haven’t spent half your student 
loans developing a palate for spiced tobacco, a gruffy staff member whose throat has endured years of cigar indulgence will help you find what you’re look-ing for.
Beginners should try the Griffin’s natural robusto 
— a mild, mellow, five-inch smoke that’s fun to puff and only costs $12. Once you’ve picked your cigar, a Churchill employee will cut its tip, hand you some matches and suggest a drink that complements its flavor.
(Technically, you have to be 21 to even enter the 
cigar shop, but if you’re just looking to buy and go, they might let it slide. Plus, if you want to show off your cool new habit, your purchase is best smoked out in public or at a party, anyway.)
Once you have your 
drink in hand, either join the usual gathering of grumbly old clientele at the bar or hide away on the patio. All sex appeal and power aside, watch-ing smoke roll out your mouth and into the air is a simple and unappreciated form of relaxation. It might even be enough to make you forget the lame Wild West statues and rose vendors creeping from behind.

Pink Zone game to support the fight against breast cancer, sporting pink jerseys in honor of the occasion. 
After a slow start, the Tritons 
took over the game, led by 19 points from Carlisle. Junior forward Tiffany Hunter, the reigning California Collegiate Athletic Association player of the week, added 11 points and six rebounds for the Tritons. 
The team struggled from the floor 
in the first half — shooting only 34 percent on nine-of-26 shooting — but was jump-started in the final minute by three-pointers from Ilg and Carlisle.
The Tritons led 29-19 at halftime.That momentum pushed the team 
throughout the second half, putting the game out of reach with a thun-dering 28-0 run. UCSD never let up its defense, and the Eagles were unable to score for over 10 minutes of regulation. 
Despite the resounding conference 
victory, Ilg said the Tritons should focus on their postseason goals.
“We realize that we have goals that 
are beyond just the game at hand. We need to be able to play 40 minutes of intense basketball, ” she said. “The postseason is almost here, and we need to be ready to compete with the best teams in the nation. ”
The wins moved UCSD to 19-1 
overall and 14-1 in conference play.
UCSD will play a pair of road 
games this week: They stop by Cal State Stanislaus on Friday, followed Chico State on Saturday.

Dorsey missed them both, and Lawley held 
his nerve to sink two free throws — taking the score to 81-75. The Tritons held on for a six-point win. 
Senior guard Tyler Acevedo connected 
on three shots from beyond the arc for the Tritons to finish with 13 points, and team-mate Casey Ryan put together his third double-double of the season with 12 points and 11 boards.
The Golden Eagles shot at 46 percent as a 
team from the field, and were led in scoring by senior guard Chris Fields, who finished with 22 points. He hit seven of 15 shots from the field and added five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Dwayne Jones finished with 19 points, while Chris Robinson added 16 and Leland Jones chipped in with 15. 
Both teams hit six triples in the game, 
and each finished with 17 points off turn-overs.
With the win, UCSD is now 5-13 overall 
and 4-11 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play. The loss dropped CSULA to 12-9 overall, and 8-8 in league action.
The Triton win came on the heels of a 
closely contested 58-68 home defeat against Cal State Dominguez Hills on Thursday, Feb. 4.
The Tritons lost the game despite solid 
efforts from Lawley and Ryan, who com-bined for 43 of the Triton’s 58 points.
Lawley posted a game-high 24 points on 
seven-of-ten shooting, with three triples and 
seven rebounds. Ryan was nearly perfect 
from the floor, connecting on nine of his 10 field goal attempts to finish with a career-high 19 points, and also pulled down eight rebounds.
Ultimately, Dominguez Hills won the 
physical battle on the glass, outrebounding the Tritons 39-30. They were able to translate this advantage into 13 second-chance points.
UCSD played a key role in its own 
demise with woeful shooting from the free-throw line. The team went 13-for-25 from the charity stripe.
The Tritons are back in action next week, 
traveling to Cal State Stanislaus on Feb. 12 and Chico State on Feb. 13.

Sophomore center Christian Hatch posted a career-high 23 points — adding 11 rebounds for his third double-double of the season — in 
a home game against CSULA on Feb. 6. Hatch has averaged 12.3 points and 9 rebounds in his last three games.tournament.
“I’m very disappointed with how 
I performed, ” Okasaki said.  “I have been struggling lately with a couple of shots that I rely on. It’s my irons and a little knock down that controls the trajectory and distance. ”
Without his usual control, 
Okasaki said he had trouble consis-tently finding greens to give himself an opportunity to go lower.
Senior Richard Morris and soph-
omore Justin Gabbert had their own troubles firing their highest scores this season. However, Okasaki said he is optimisitc the team’s perfor-mance will improve after a good week of practice.
“We had a practice round that 
went well on Wednesday and a pro-ductive practice Friday, ” he said. “If we can start playing better individu-ally, we will play better as a team.  One guy playing well can motivate the rest of team to play better. ”
Next up for UCSD is the Cal 
State San Marcos Invitational on Feb. 8 and Feb. 9. Last season, the Tritons finished in eighth place at the competiton.
And at 6,750 yards, there is an 
excellent opportunity for the team to go low, Okasaki said.
“[It is realistic that] we can shoot 
around par on this course, ” he said.  “In our practice round there last week, I shot 67, so it’s definitely doable. Weather permitting, the course isn’t too difficult, but the recent rain will make it tougher, as the course doesn’t drain well and will play sloppy. ”

MEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD was 
eager to get back on track this week-
end after losing five games in a row.
They did just that on Saturday, Feb. 6, beating Cal State Los Angeles 83-77 at RIMAC Arena. 
Senior guard Jordan Lawley, the 
conference’s leading scorer, shoul-dered the scoring load as usual for 
the Tritons, posting a game-high 29 
points. Lawley shot nine-for-18 from the field, and scored 19 of his points in the second half.
Sophomore center Christian 
Hatch also stepped up for the strug-gling Tritons, delivering a career-high 23 points. He broke his personal best of 16 while tallying 11 rebounds for his third double-double of the season.
UCSD got off to a hot start, sink-
ing 10 of its first 15 shots. Hatch and Lawley combined to score 15 points in the game’s first 10 minutes, helping the Tritons build a 25-14 lead.
The Golden Eagles closed to with-
in four at 30-26 on a layup with 5:12 left in the period, but UCSD closed the half on an 11-4 run to take a 41-30 lead into the locker room. 
After the break, UCSD saw its 
lead pushed back up to 12 following a pair of Acevedo three-pointers, but the Golden Eagles came roaring back, closing to within five at 79-74 with 1:38 left to play.
After both teams failed to 
score, Los Angeles senior guard Dwayne Jones got a steal in the UCSD backcourt, resulting in 
a trip to the line for junior 
forward Mark Dorsey, where he could have cut the deficit to two with 36 seconds remaining. 
Fortunately for the Tritons, 
UCSD snapped a five-
game losing streak against Cal StateLos Angeles.

MEN’S GOLF — The Tritons opened 
their 2010 season on Feb. 2 with a third-place finish at the San Diego Intercollegiate. The team shot a two-round total of 629, finishing 
38 strokes behind winner Univeristy of San Diego and host Point Loma Nazarene.
UCSD finished 
ten strokes ahead of San Diego State’s B squad, and 28 strokes in front of Cal State San Marcos.
Although USD is 
ranked an impressive No. 42 in Division-I — according to Golfweek — Triton senior captain Keith Okasaki said that fact doesn’t excuse his team’s disappointing performance.
“We really just 
didn’t play that well, ” he said. “It had been a long time since we played in a team for-mat and had a rough 
tournament. I just tell the guys to keep their heads up, and don’t worry about it. ”
Senior Raj Samra led the Tritons 
with rounds of 78-76 for a 10-over-par 154, and a ninth-place finish overall. 
Freshman Anubhav Rastogi came 
in three strokes behind Samra in his first tournament as a Triton. The frehsman matched Samra’s low score in the first round for UCSD.  
Okasaki finished in a tie for 16th 
after a pair of 80s. UCSD’s No. 1 golfer said he had expected more of himself, and was hoping to start the spring season strong after finishes of T-8 and T-26 closed out the fall schedule.
In the first tournament of the new 
year, the rust from the long layoff was apparent to Okasaki, who admitted to having some trouble with his iron-play. Despite practicing throughout the winter break in his hometown, he said his swing and rhythm just weren’t there during the San Diego A POINTED SWEEP

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — 
Coming into the final stretch of the season, the Tritons are firing on all cylinders.
The eighth-ranked women’s 
basketball team was victorious against Cal State Dominguez Hills on Feb. 4 and Cal State Los Angeles on Feb. 6, winning both games by a combined 52 points. UCSD beat Cal State Dominguez Hills 83-57 and rolled past Cal State Los Angeles 75-43 for the team’s 18th and 19th wins of the sea-son.
“We are finally 
all on the same page on both defense and offense, ” senior guard Annette Ilg said. “We are able to run our sets very effectively now, and the chemistry on the team just seemed to click this week. ”
Playing against Dominguez 
Hills on Thursday, sopho-more guard Daisy Feder had a career-high 19 points, while fel-low sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle scored 17 points. Ilg contributed 14 points and three steals to the Triton effort. The Tritons had a tough 
night at the free-throw line, shooting only 47 percent in the first half, which allowed Dominguez Hills to stay close.
However, defensive pressure 
forced the Toros into first-half 
turnovers that the Tritons converted into 19 points — with 10 points coming on the fast break.
The Toros found 
themselves in even deeper trouble when Neka Mixon, their leading scorer and rebounder, picked up three early fouls — confined to the bench for most of the first half. The Tritons took full advantage of this weak spot, holding a formidable 17-point lead at halftime. 
UCSD continued dominat-
ing after the break, extending its lead by as much as 32 points. Triton bench players contrib-uted a season-high 42 points.
