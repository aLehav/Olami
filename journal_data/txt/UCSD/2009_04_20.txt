One of the newest trademarks 
of John Muir College closed shop 
during spring break, moving from UCSD premises to Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach.
Since opening in August 2005, 
Muir Surf and Skate thrived in its location across from El Mercado and Redwood Lounge. Because of its close proximity to the renowned Black’s Beach, it was a first stop for surfers and skaters alike in meeting all equipment needs. 
However, when UCSD Recreation 
Outback Adventures announced it would be opening its surf shop on campus April 24, Muir Surf and Skate manager Scott Lembach said he was compelled to relocate.
“It wasn’t our initial intent to 
move, ” Lembach said. “But we can-not compete against a large organi-zation such as Outback Adventures. ”
Though Outback Adventures 
has been providing gear for outdoor sporting adventures since 1978, its interests never conflicted with the smaller surf and skate shop until the creation of Outback Adventures Surf Shop.
Set in the more central Price 
Center, Outback Adventures Surf Shop is expected to attract a lot more attention and customers than Muir Surf and Skate did in its iso-lated location. 
“Moving to Pacific Beach opened 
a realm of new changes, ” Lembach said. “The new location is signifi-cantly bigger, has more merchan-dise, and for the first time, is in the

Though he tasted success with the 
unanimous passage of his preliminary 
student-organization funding legisla-tion on April 8, Vice President of Finance and Resources Naasir Lakhani looked anything but triumphant at last Wednesday’s A.S. Council meeting, when the second half of his proposal sparked debate between councilmem-bers before eventually being dismissed as “unfinished business. ”
Lakhani called for the establish-
ment of a student-organization fund-ing advisory board, comprised of 11 students who would oversee all fund-ing requests. These students would ultimately be appointed by a com-mittee made up of the associ-ate vice presi-dent of student organizations, vice president of finance and resources and four A.S. sena-tors.
At the sug-
gestion of Revelle College Senator Katie Hall, a sub-committee was formed to dis-cuss which stu-dents should be appointed to the advisory board. According to Lakhani, who is serving on the committee, they decided yesterday to rec-ommend that the funding board be headed by the AVP of student orga-nizations and composed of seven A.S. senators.
Lakhani had originally intended 
for the board to be composed of stu-dent appointees. However, this pro-posal drew opposition from Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Lana Blank, who argued that it is unrealistic to place students on the advisory board and expect them to understand the council’s funding pro-

The San Diego Police Department 
released a statement last week warn-ing the public about a string of simi-lar crimes in which a man grabbed women and exposed himself in the University Towne Center area.
A total of 10 incidents have been 
reported since May 2008 involving a male suspect approaching a woman, touching her buttocks or crotch area and/or exposing himself, then fleeing the scene. Six of the cases occurred within the last month.
The suspect is described as a 
clean-shaven Latino or Middle Eastern male between the age of 20 and 25, standing at 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 10 inches with a thin build, short, dark hair and a medium to dark complexion. He is usually seen wearing dark pants and a hooded sweatshirt.
In light of these incidents, SDPD 
advises members of the public to walk and exercise in groups, park in well-lit areas, avoid cell-phone use on the way to their cars and report individuals who loiter around areas for no apparent purpose.
Anyone with information regard-
ing these or other attacks is asked to contact either the SDPD Northern Division at (858) 552-1700 or Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477 or sdcrimestoppers.com.

There’s a lot about the 
Grove Caffe that wor-ries the A.S. Council.
Most concerning is 
the roughly $126,000 
of debt that hovers over the cafe, roughly $80,000 of which has accu-mulated over the last two years alone.
Accordingly, the few council-
members aware of the Grove’s pre-dicament are pushing to shut down the longtime campus landmark once and for all, cutting their losses and paying off the debt with funds generated by other A.S. enterprises.
The council’s final vote on the 
fate of the Grove is set to take place this Wednesday. 
Last year the council decided to review the Grove’s financial perfor-mance, using this year as an evalu-ation period. After witnessing con-tinued losses throughout the last two quarters, A.S. President Donna Bean is about ready to jump ship.
“We’re pouring student fees into 
the Grove right now, ” Bean said. “It’s over $120,000 in debt. If we continue to run the Grove then we’re basically subsidizing it. ”
Y et others still see hope for the 
beleaguered enterprise. The Grove’s employees, led by student managers

NaomiÊ Sweo,Ê AnitaÊ Vergis,Ê DanielleÊ WarrenThomas Frank and Autumn Hays, are 
in the process of devising a new busi -
ness model for the Grove, which they intend to present before the council at this Wednesday’s meeting. They want to sell fewer espresso drinks and more food, escaping the now-saturated campus coffee market and attempting to carve out a new niche by offering a variety of hot sand -
wiches and pizza.
They also said they want the 
Grove to stay open for a shorter period throughout the year, closing in the summer and over campus breaks when fewer customers are around.
Additionally, Frank and Hays said 
that manager Cleveland Thomas — hired by the council in the summer of 2007 in an effort to revive the fail-ing business — informed them that he wouldn’t be returning next year. Thomas’ departure would mean the removal of his $50,000 annual salary from the Grove’s expenses. 
But it might not be enough.
“I’m torn because while it’s 
a great place and it serves a lot 
of students, we can’t just fall further and further into debt, ” Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations Chelsea Maxwell said. “Ideally I would love to do something where it could stay open, but I just don’t know if A.S. has the means. ”
Since September 2008, the Grove’s 
profits have been marginal at best, fluctuating month-to-month. Most recently, the cafe reported a profit of just under $200 for the month of February. 
It then lost over $7,000 in March.According to Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Naasir Lakhani, these inconsistencies are explained by a simple formula: The Grove loses money when students go on vacation and makes money when students are around. This past summer, the cafe remained open and lost over $14,000; in December and January, when students left cam -
pus for winter break, it lost nearly $11,000.
November and March, which saw 
losses of $6,000 and $7,000 respec -
tively, remain something of an anom -
aly, Lakhani said.
The Grove’s financial troubles extend far into its long history at UCSD.
When it opened in the mid-1980s, 
the Grove existed as a part of the Crafts Center. The wood patio that still surrounds the cafe was con -
structed by Crafts Center Director Ron Carlson, who also planted the trees and shrubbery that adorn the Grove’s planked walkways.
Carlson ran the Grove for sev -
eral years, gradually ceding the reigns of management to the cafe’s student employees. Things didn’t always go smoothly. Every few years, busi -
ness went sour and profits dipped into the red, prompting Carlson to step in and lend his exper -
tise to the students in charge.
But in 2007, 
Carlson decided to cut loose from the failing business — at the time over $25,000 in debt — and sold his 50 percent share of the cafe to the A.S. Council, rendering the Grove a fully student-run enter -
prise.
Another year of sinking profits 
forced the council to take action. After rejecting the idea of a Grove partnership with the Rady School of Management, and considering shutting the Grove down completely, the council hired Thomas, who had previously managed campus eater -
ies, with hopes he would bring more stable leadership to the cafe.
Now, a year and a half later, things have only gotten worse. Employees initially 
blamed the Grove’s continued accu-mulation of debt on construction work in the Student Center, which made the cafe virtually inaccessible to students for much of Fall Quarter 2007. Others attribute these failures to the high cost of maintaining a nonstudent manager.
“There’s been revenue, but not the 
kind of revenue to sustain that type of salary, ” Lakhani said.
Bean acknowl-
edged that when councilmembers hired Thomas, they were aware that revenue would dip with the expense of the new position. However,  she said they never anticipated that the cafe’s debt would reach the excessive 
level that it has.
“[The debt] was supposed to hit 
maybe eighty or ninety thousand, then peak and turn around, ” Bean said. “But it hasn’t done that. It’s just gone deeper into debt. ”
Some former employees have 
been critical of Thomas’ performance as manager.
“I didn’t know what Cleveland’s 
role was, ” said a former employee of the cafe who was let go earlier this quarter and who wished to remain annonymous. “I saw him there, but I didn’t know what he was really there f o r.”
Though Bean, Frank and Hays 
are unwilling to lay the blame on the new manager, they acknowledge that Thomas has taken a largely hands-off approach to managing the cafe over the last several months.
“He did pretty much leave a stu -
dent in charge a lot of the time, ” Bean said.
However, Frank and Hays — who 
have been responsible for running most of the Grove’s day-to-day opera -
tions, including the hiring and firing of employees — say that Thomas has simply been preparing them to take over once he leaves in June.
“Cleveland is the guy who is 
always on our backs going ‘no, no, no, you’ve got to do it like this, ’ and mak -
ing sure all the employees are work-ing and things like that, ” Hays said. “Mainly, though, his biggest thing has been making sure he gets really good management in there and really good employees and training them to take over. ”
Thomas has also been criticized 
by a number of former Grove employ -
ees and customers for his allegedly abrupt workplace demeanor.
“I think there were a lot of fac -
tors working against him, ” Bean said. “But I know some workers person -
ally and there are a lot of students and customers who have had bad experiences with him. On a personal level I don’t think he was the best of managers. ”
Thomas declined to comment.
In general, all involved in the Grove’s dilemma agree that its poor performance is mostly a 
result of the lack of foot traffic in the area. 
In its glory days, the Grove was 
the only coffee shop at UCSD, and was afforded plenty in the way of cus -
tomers — until the Student Center began losing much of its business to new campus hub Price Center in 1993.
In addition, there are over 10 cof -
fee shops spread throughout campus, with more are on the way. Espresso kiosks seem to spring up overnight in ever more convenient locations.
“Twenty-four years ago you 
couldn’t get coffee every two steps on campus, ” Hays said. “We were the 
coffee place, and it was still kind of an exotic thing to go and get a cup of coffee. But now, every two steps there’s a coffee cart. They’re all over the place. ”
As a result, profits simply aren’t 
what they used to be.
“There’s a focus away from the

Senior Staff WriterStudent Center to the Price Center expansion and there’s an oversatura-tion of coffee on our campus right now, ” Bean said.
Nevertheless, the cafe’s employ-
ees have fought to draw more atten-tion to the former campus hub. The Grove has run an extended guerilla marketing campaign over the last two quarters, distributing coupons on Library Walk and talking up a newly revised menu including sand-wich wraps and breakfast burritos. Thomas set up a grill in front of the cafe shortly after he was hired, serv-ing barbequed items like burgers, ribs and pork sandwiches in an effort to attract more lunchtime business.
“The fact of the matter is that we 
don’t have foot traffic, ” Frank said. “So what we’ve been working on for the last quarter is finding new ways of getting that foot traffic. It’s our job to physically pull students into our shop. ”
Despite these efforts, the Grove 
has continued to flounder. The the-ory that the cafe is still capable of turning a profit while students are in session — also shared by Maxwell — appears defeated by November’s sig-nificant loss. According to Lakhani, March’s $7,000 loss is also surprising, despite the fact that finals week and spring break fell within that period.
“Before seeing the March num-
bers, I was really wondering, ‘Why would we want to shut this place down after looking at January and February and seeing positive numbers there?’” Lakhani said. “But then, after seeing March and seeing it lose $7,000, that was kind of a big shock to me. ”
Grove employees think the council might be able to offer additional assistance rather 
than shut the cafe down completely. 
Frank and Hays have suggested 
moving the popular A.S. Bear Garden to the grassy hill near the Student Center once a month, and would like the Grove to cater the event rather than see the council offer the lucrative task to an outside vendor like Subway.
“If we catered the Bear Garden, 
[the council] would be paying an A.S. enterprise, ” Frank said. “They would be paying themselves. ” 
According to Associate Vice 
President of Programming Garrett Berg, however, the likelihood of cre-ating a Grove-centric Bear Garden is extremely slim.
“We looked into the Grove doing 
the food and they just don’t have the capability to make enough food for a thousand people, ” Berg said. 
“In addition, there’s literally not an 
ounce of flat land on the [grassy hill], so we wouldn’t be able to do any of the things we do [at Bear Gardens], like booths, tables, games — any of it. It’s also just not big enough for a thousand people, whereas Matthews Quad is. ”
After Thomas’ entrance as man-
ager, the council formed the Grove Advisory Committee. Consisting of Maxwell, Lakhani, Bean, Thomas and Student Center officials, the body is designed to oversee the cafe’s finances and provide the council with greater insight into its operations. 
However, the committee has met 
only a handful of times, and has kept any interaction with Grove manage-ment at an informal level. 
“It’s just really informal, ” Maxwell 
said. “It’s not like ‘this is our agenda, ’ and stuff. It’s just to keep the lines of communication open. ”
Frank and Hays just met with 
members of the committee for the first time earlier this month. It was at that meeting that they found out the council would be voting on whether to shut the cafe down during week five.
Last week, the legislation to close 
the Grove was moved up to this Wednesday; neither Frank nor Hays were notified of the change in sched-ule.
“I only recently even knew the 
advisory committee existed, ” Hays said. “That’s one thing we’re going to bring before A.S. We want to have more communication with them. Until recently, we didn’t even know we were supposed to have that kind of back-and-forth communication with them. We would actually really like that, in fact. ”
Frank believes some funding from 
the council would go a long way toward helping the Grove.
“We never get any funding from 
them, ” Frank said. “We’re $0 on their budget. So even if we just had $5,000 a year, I wouldn’t be using a 1968 freezer that gets us marked off on our health inspection every time. ”
However, Bean is unwilling to 
put student fees toward the ailing business. The council currently has enough funds saved up from profits generated by A.S. Soft Reserves and Lecture Notes to pay off the debt accumulated by the Grove if it is closed this Wednesday. 
Whether the Grove shuts its doors 
for good will depend largely on how well its student employees are able to convince councilmembers that the cafe still has a shot at making a come-back. They’ll be presenting their new business model before the council on Wednesday, following a public forum on the matter.

cess. She suggested appointing sena-
tors to the board instead.
Although Lakhani feels that 
appointing students to the advisory board would would better incorporate student involvement and give  sena-tors time to focus on their yearly proj-ects, he said that the committee ulti-mately felt that senators would make more responsible decisions since they could be better held accountable for their actions.
AVP Athletic Relations and 2009-
10 VP Finance-elect Peter Benesch — who worked with Lakhani on developing the new funding process — believes that for now, the council’s skepticism over student capabilities will predominate.
“Basically, it’s just going have to 
turn into a senator-based commit-tee, ” Benesch said. “What we can do is …  let [the committee] establish 
itself, and [later] outside individu-als can be incorporated into the process. ”

independent spirit of Muir College, which was known for being one of the only campuses in the country to boast its own surf shop.
Owen said that when he attended 
admit day as a prospective student, he received a good deal from Muir Surf and Skate on a wetsuit. Though it wasn’t his primary motivation to attend UCSD, he said that it factored into his decision and got him excited for college.
“[I thought], I want to go there, 
there’s even a surf shop near the dorms, ” Owen said.
Though the shop is no longer on 
campus, it still provides the same 
services at its new location. UCSD students receive the same 15 percent discount on wetsuits, Rainbow san-dals and other select items.
“We still support UCSD, ” 
Lembach said. “We really enjoyed working with students, and love surfing and skating. We love doing what we do. Everything we have done in the past is the same, and we have not changed. ”

Sorry, I can’t help myself, I have 
to brag: I was lucky enough to see the Beatles play at 
Coachella last Friday. OK, maybe it was technically  just an aged Paul 
McCartney, but if you closed your eyes, opened your mind to a land-scape compilation of everything you’ve ever read about the Fab Four and sank into the field of cheering fans the likes of black-and-white Beatlemania film rolls, I swear it was magic. 
Stay with me — this is going 
somewhere. So after the show, as I stumbled dreamily toward my friends at the yellow-tarped star-shaped bamboo edifice that was probably only erected for the express purpose of finding the friends you were separated from in a music-and-heat-fueled delirium, I passed a middle-aged McCartney fan remarking loudly to her festival mate. 
Apparently she just couldn’t 
believe that there were so many young people at the show — how could we even know those songs, s h e  w o n d e r e d  a l o u d ,  a s  t h e y  w e r e  written decades before any of us were born!
This reminded me of the same 
mystified inquires I usually get from my mom when she hears me listen-ing to Cat Stevens, or the bewil-dered face my uncle makes when I recommend a Bob Dylan album to his daughters. It’s as if the idea that one could enjoy anything that came before herself is totally foreign, and almost threatening.
But the Beatles, Cat Stevens and 
Bob Dylan are all pretty big names — I would be surprised to find any-one living in America who hadn’t at least heard of them.
Plus, thanks to the Internet — 
a little piece of technology most of our parents still haven’t totally mastered — kids who grew up in the ’80s and ’90s have a way more extensive knowledge of music than any previous generation. 
It’s a pretty big claim, I know. 
But if you don’t believe me, scroll through your iPod. Right now I’ve got a range that includes the afore-mentioned trio, the Jackson 5, the Fiery Furnaces, Frank Sinatra, the Hold Steady, Beyoncé, Green Day, the Pointer Sisters, Fela Kuti and Cloud Cult. My mom’s CD rota-tion? The Eagles, James Taylor and U2 — only.
And anyway, by the this-hap-
pened-before-you-were-born logic, people of our parents’ generation would only be eating food cooked in microwaves, seeing as the oven clearly predates their births; no one would read books; most people wouldn’t be vaccinated against dis-eases like polio; and sex and beer would be unfortunately absent from our lives.
So next time your dad implies 
you’re a poser because that Ramones album you’re jamming to definitely predates your conception, just tell him those shoes he’s wearing are so  
prehistoric.

STUDENT LIFE —  It’s inevitable: If 
you’ve ever lived on campus, you too have visited a barren dining hall on Saturday and dreamed of a world in which you could break free from your meal-plan shackles and swipe your student ID for a Subway footlong. 
Each year, on-campus residents 
must cough-up either $2,100 or $2,750 (depending on whether they live in a dorm or an apartment) for a dining plan — quite a commitment when tastier options await students’ mal-nourished fingertips in Price Center. Especially when the cost of fresh meals is too much for dining halls to maintain on week-ends, when fewer customers make for an array of premade dishes basking idly under the glow of a heat lamp. 
It’s past time 
dining dollars were given some much-needed legroom. If they could be used at all on-campus restaurants, students would see fresher options and current dining facilities wouldn’t be stretched to stay open when operational limita-tions don’t allow.
On Jan. 23, Associate Director of Housing, Dining and Hospitality Steve Casad responded to student din-ing complaints by proposing to add extra dollars to residents’ prepaid din-
ing plans so they would have money to spend at other restaurants on cam-pus. However, his idea was rejected by a 10-student advisory committee comprised of mem-bers from the A.S. Council, the Inter-College Residents’ Association and all six colleges. Casad’s 
proposal was denied because it ulti-mately missed the point. The majority of committee members saw no point in forcing students to buy extra dining dollars when they could ultimately use TritonPlus,  a voluntary  card-swiping program with a similar function. 
Casad’s original proposal may have 
been shot down, but that doesn’t mean negotiations should stop. The advisory committee could gauge student inter-est in adding Price Center eateries to their dining-dollar options and pro-ceed accordingly. There’s no harm in surveying students — especially when the alternative leaves dining halls in a financial rut and diners without per-fectly viable variety.
Instead of forcing students to pay 
more up front, as Casad suggested, the Housing and Dining Department could allot a certain number of din-ing dollars to cover weekend meal expenses, then reimburse those busi-nesses accordingly.

A.S. COUNCIL —  Sure, it was pretty 
shocking that the A.S. Council moved to keep the Grove Caffe open in 2007, even after the enterprise had slipped significantly into the red and then-co-owner Ron Carlson jumped ship, leaving students in the vulnerable position to bear the debt alone.
It was pretty shocking that in less 
than a year, the new council-hired professional manager Cleveland Thomas threw logic and reasonable business practices to the wind, alien-ated the majority of Grove enthusiasts and quintupled the decades-acquired debt he was hired to fix.
It was pretty shocking that even as 
councilmembers ran a referendum to increase student fees this winter and campaigned on platforms of fiscal transparency and council account-ability a quarter later, none were con-cerned with their $126,000-in-debt enterprise.
And it’s pretty shocking that Grove 
employees’ only response to all of this — and to the cafe’s possible closure — is to sell cheap T-shirts, hand out candy on Library Walk and rally for more funding.
But nothing looks shocking about 
this Wednesday’s A.S. meeting, at which councilmembers will discuss and decide the Grove’s fate in eerily 2007-esque fashion. The meeting will be preceded by an A.S. Forum — proven, of course, to be the most effective way of judging student opin-ion and informing complex finan-cial decisions, based on its ability to draw neutral input from all types of students, rather than, you know, just attracting the handful of people who are personally invested in keeping their jobs at the cafe. 
Although this big choice is just 
two days away, councilmembers remain uninformed about the Grove’s current state of affairs. Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations Chelsea Maxwell, who has been responsible for overseeing Grove suc-cess and acting as a council-enterprise liaison for the last two years, doesn’t know what’s been going on at the cafe and has no recommendations for the council. Vice President of Finance and Resources Naasir Lakhani, who is responsible for council finances, is <PQ[<QUM1\¼[;MZQW][6W:MITTa

 dining dollars 
were given some 
much-needed 
legroom.one of the Grove’s fiercest supporters 
despite its persistent monetary losses. And cafe employees, who will plead their case at the council meeting and still haven’t come up with a concrete business plan, are plowing blindly ahead on a whine and a prayer.
By all accounts, Thomas — sail-
ing on salary until his contract ends in June — has checked out, giving student managers Thomas Frank and Autumn Hays free reign over the place (which, according to current and former student employees, has only added to the cafe’s inefficiency). The pair will now present their “busi-ness plan” — a random and largely unfeasible wishlist that lacks any sem-blance of fiscal analysis or historical perspective — to the council.
The plan includes a move away 
from coffee drinks toward lunch food, even though much of the current debt was accrued when Thomas updated coffee and espresso-machine equip-ment. Frank and Hays said they plan to stay with the same food vendors, but haven’t researched the expenses involved with an increase in food or if customers are even interested.
Moreover, they want to purchase a 
conveyor oven (the several-thousand-dollar cost of which they have no plan to fund) to mimic the dining commons’ pizza and sandwich ser-vice, trading one campus surplus for another. 
The pair also proposes that the 
council relocate Bear Gardens to the Grove and pay the cafe to cater those events. Forget for a moment that this would likely increase event costs for a worse product, and would mean throwing even more student money at the failing cafe — it simply isn’t feasible. According to Associate Vice President of Programming Garrett Berg, whose office plans Bear Gardens, the Grove lacks the neces-sary space and resources. 
Most outrageously, Frank and Hays 
have suggested that the council fund the enterprise as if it were a student org (and as if absorbing a $126,000 debt wasn’t enough). This illustrates one of the fundamental problems with the Grove: No one seems to recognize it’s a business that should be mak-ing money for the council, not the other way around. The purpose of an enterprise is to bring the Associated Students revenue so the council’s bud-get won’t be so desperately dependent 
KIM CYPRIAN /GUARDIANon student fees. 
The cafe’s future looks bleak: 
Grove managers and employees remain completely out of touch, and councilmembers (particularly those specifically charged with overseeing the enterprise) remain unconcerned and even disinterested. But despite all the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, some councilmembers are stubbornly attached to the floun-dering cafe. Students can only hope that this year’s council really has the institutional memory it brags about, finally bringing an end to this bal-looning debt — rather than meeting the Grove’s give-us-one-more-chance presentation with 2007’s leave-it-to-the-next-council mentality.

are closing their dining facilities on the weekends 
due to a declining customer base and lost profit, according to Casad. At UCSD, approximately 40 percent of every dining dollar goes toward work-ers’ salaries, making it expensive to keep facilities open on weekends while simultaneously provid-ing enough fresh options for students. Dining hall revenue also drops a staggering 60 percent on weekends, according to Casad. Saturday and Sunday Price Center dollars, paired with shut-ting down or reducing service at the dining halls, would help alleviate this revenue loss. 
At San Diego State University, students’ dining 
dollars can be redeemed at on-campus cafeterias and 16 local restaurants or markets — includ-ing Starbucks, Rubio’s and an Aztec market and convenience store — eliminating the need to scrounge for change or swipe another credit card. 
Closing dining halls on the weekend has been 
discussed briefly within the advisory commit-tee, but trial runs must be made before any new policies are adopted, Casad said. Because Sierra Summit will be closed during the 2009-10 aca-demic year for renovations, Casad wants to use  
this period  as a test run to evaluate how a closed 
dining facility im pac
ts students.
In the end, though — be it through campus-
wide surveying or, perhaps, a series of town-hall style meetings in the dining halls — the decision of the advisory committee will only reflect the wants and needs of students once they’ve had a chance to have their say. Because, after all, these are changes that would affect everybody, not just the 10-member committee holding the sway. 
In such a large and limited community, resi-
dents should be presented with every possible opportunity to tailor their lifestyle. A change as 
positive and as pragmatic as this one must be aggressively pursued — otherwise, both students 
and the dining halls will continue suffering.

In the college student-infested complexes near campus, peace 
and quiet comes with a pricetag. For a slightly higher rent, Regents Court offers a fully gated apartment setting with an 
emphasis on community — one can generally count on a muted atmosphere when trying to get some work done. On the flip side, due to the number of resident families, a party is not the required minimum for being slammed with a noise complaint. Management and maintenance staff are quick to respond to tenants, and facilities are attractive and well-maintained. But practice precision parking before tackling the multilevel garage, or risk damaging your car while maneuvering in and out of cramped spaces.
— Emily Ku
Senior Staff WriterLa Jolla/UTCHousing Guide
As one of the older complexes nearby, La Jolla International Gardens is in dire need of remodeling. But if you can overlook the 
inevitable aging-appliance breakdowns — and the time it takes for the leasing office to fix them — the complex offers decently sized living quarters at a cheaper price and convenient access to two campus shuttle lines. When choosing your location, pay attention to its relation to the laundry room, as washers and dryers are not interior features. Also be prepared to pay up for a mandatory carpet cleaning when you move out, although you’ll notice it was far from spotless to begin with.
— Emily Ku
Senior Staff WriterConvenience is the key word when describ-ing why a person would choose to live in Costa Verde Village Apartments. Its 
proximity to campus and the fact that the complex is surrounded on all sides by shuttling options are huge factors in why so many students opt to live there. 
The units are spacious enough. And having a 
washer and dryer inside the apartment radically reduces the risk of finding your wet laundry sim-pering in a pathetic pile on top of the machine or countertop. Paying the water bill, not so attractive, but it’s a small price to pay to ensure that articles of clothing aren’t lost.
Of course there are downsides to living in 
Costa Verde Apartments. The office staffers aren’t very friendly — some are downright snob-bish — and are easily peeved by simple ques-tions such as where to pick up your FedEx and UPS packages. Furthermore, the appliances are a touch too breakable, and one of the elevators in my building breaks down at least once every two weeks. It is notoriously unreliable around the time a new quarter starts — the mass influx of students returning to their apartments after a long weekend or break with friends and family is apparently too much for that poor complex to handle.
Thankfully, maintenance service is fairly good 
at and quick to repair the various complications in the apartments. Friendly, too.
The overall experience of living in Costa 
Verde is alright. Rent is on the pricier side — about $2,025 for two bedrooms and a loft, and that’s a bargain. Nevertheless, living so close to the Arriba shuttle line’s first stop is a perk simply too coveted to pass on, particularly as class rolls around at 9 a.m.
— Connie Shieh
Senior Staff WriterAfter living at the Verano condominium complex for two years, you come to realize a few things about the place. The most concerning is that Verano boasts quite possibly one of the most hardcore parking-lot 
security forces in all of UTC.
It’s hard to complain about the abundance of parking for residents, though.
What’s more, the place is actually fairly serene. Four vibrant shades of brown adorn the stucco walls and the Mormon temple’s soaring ivory towers make the place look like Narnia after several years of rapid suburban development. 
And while devoid of any local nightlife — save for that one guy who plays 
shitty renditions of John Mayer songs in front of Tapioca Express some evenings — the neighborhood is conveniently close to campus. Best of all, the nearby shopping center offers fairly excellent double-wrapped burritos until 2 a.m. I recommend the Cali Monster with extra avocado.

Hillcrest has a lot more going for it than just the Gay Pride Parade. Although, the parade 
is reason enough to shack up in one of the most fabulous neighborhoods San Diego has to offer. 
With some of the city’s best dining, 
from Crest Cafe on Robinson Avenue to Bronx Pizza on Washington Street, a bite to eat is never so delicious or easy to come by as it is in Hillcrest. Ethnic eateries are also nearly impossible to avoid and Whole Foods, Rite Aid and Ralphs are almost too close for comfort — as are dozens of over-priced over-trendy thrift shops. 
A night out is never far and no 
matter your preference, there’s a bar or club to suit. Universal overloads in the late evening hours and Numbers (just south of University Avenue on Park Boulevard) sports shirtless bartenders and a crowd straight from LIPS, while Alibi’s the seediest biker-style dive bar near the city center. Even campus is more accessible than anywhere but the worst La Jolla has to offer. A hop, skip or bike ride to La Jolla Medical Center will put you at the Campus-Hillcrest shuttle. Fabulous indeed.

Senior Staff Writer
HillcrestLodged in a suburban side street just 15 minutes walking dis-tance to the Regents shuttle, Playmor is like any other La Jolla housing unit: a peaceful neighborhood with bad parking. If 
you’re charmed by ’70s decor, you’ll go wild for each apartment’s glass-shingled chandelier and metal-rod staircase. But beware: Playmor’s vintage interior comes at the price of janky house fix-tures, and since each apartment has its own landlord, decorating leeway and general maintenance will vary. The complex’s perks include an unpopulated pool, hot tub and nearby canyon trail, but if you can’t handle a fixer-upper take your rent money elsewhere.

If you want excitement, Clairemont is not exactly the place to be. The quiet neighborhood east of Pacific Beach is comprised mostly of young families and retired veterans, with a spattering of college students living in th eir midst. With front-yard McCain-Palin signs 
outnumbering Obama-Biden  ones from  November’s election, the atmosphere could hardly 
be described as liberal or college friendly. Beyond walking distance to any bars and gener-ally a few miles from most UCSD house parties, going without a car would put an end to your social life in this neighborhood.
But, assuming you have reliable transportation, Clairemont is only five minutes away 
from P .B. and just a 10-minute drive from downtown and Ocean Beach — close to all the action, but just far enough to avoid the noise and traffic. Driving to school never takes more than 15 minutes when using local streets, and the 41 bus takes you right to campus, helping you avoid UCSD parking and its inordinate fees. With Ralphs, Vons, Henry’s and dozens of restaurants a short walk from most of the neighborhood’s housing, food is easily accessible. And if all else fails, Cotixan is always good for large servings of 24-hour Mexican food. Decently sized bedrooms in single-family homes can easily be found from $450 to $650. 
Not the flashiest neighborhood that San Diego has to offer, Clairemont still has its 
quirks. It’s home to a handful of thrift shops, vegan restaurants and more comic-book stores than anyone would need to visit in their lifetime. Conveniently located and reasonably priced, the neighborhood is a nice option — if you don’t mind driving to the party.

A FREE online directory of rental and

Go toThere are three things you need to know about liv-
ing in Pacific Beach: location, location, location. Although right-off-Garnet complexes are a plenty in 
this three-college town, the extra effort it takes to find a sick residential rental will come back tenfold when you aren’t confronted with constant beach-and-bar buzz or awakened at 3 a.m. to liquor-fueled lawn arguments each night. Plus, landlords are likely to be much more chill when the whole block isn’t flooded with irresponsible college types.
Y ou can walk just about anywhere in P .B., so prox-
imity to beach versus freeway is really just a matter of preference. If you’re willing to throw down a few extra Benjamins a year to live beachside, be ready for a longer trek to campus. By car it only takes about 15 minutes to get to school, but double that during rush hour — when P .B. ’s lone on-ramp backs up as a mass of students and res-idents head out — and triple it when you opt for cheaper, but wait-intensive public transportation.
P .B. has everything a college student could ask for: 
thrifting at Goodwill-style segundos and indie-fabulous boutiques a la Buffalo Exchange; trendy, hipster or just plain expensive clothes stores; and nighttime hot spots ranging from gloriously shady dives to “The Real World: San Diego”’s bar of choice. Add to that a festival of sushi, pizza, burgers, Slurpees and ’berto’s 24-hour Mexican food. And it’s the county’s epicenter for tattoo parlors and record, sex and smoke shops — perfect to satiate any college-rebellion dreams you’ve been harboring.

Roberto’s becomes a seafood taco shack called El Zarape and Happy Hour at Rock Bottom becomes $1 drink night at Cheers. What’s even better is that almost everything you need is within walking or biking distance from your quaint little neighborhood — saving you gas and allowing for more neighborly interaction. 
Only problem is living in University Heights is your social life. Y ou’ll 
either have to recruit a good group of buddies to move with you or learn to rub shoulders with the locals — it takes some serious cajoling to con-vince your La Jolla friend contingent to make the 20-minute drive down to your ’hood. The daily campus commute is a bitch too; you either have to bike down to Hillcrest Medical Center and catch a 30-minute shuttle or make a daily drive up I-5. Either way, being stuck in the area isn’t too bad: Hillcrest, North Park and downtown are at your side to help you cope with the loneliness.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOKFOCUS 
BY ASHLEY LEE
STAFF WRITER
When members of the Guardian  see palettes of 
untouched newspapers discarded behind the 
Dumpsters at the Student Center, we die a lit-
tle inside. When Revelle College sophomore Samantha Sanchez comes across these unread mounds, she sees endless fashion potential.
On April 24 at the Loft, closing out UCSD’s traditional 
Earth Week lineup, Project Trashion will merge trash with fashion, giving students a creative outlet to show their love for Mother Earth. The eco-friendly fashion show will bring local merchants and student designers together to send their green garments and accessories down the run-way. The Trashion show will be preceded by VidFest — a student short film contest with an emphasis on spreading awareness of environmental issues — and wrap up with a DJ dance party at the Loft.
“ At UCSD, a lot of the efforts for sustainability are 
more at the operations level — the building level, with our solar panels and other energy efficient technology. There’s a creative aspect to sustainability that’s not as evident, ” Earl Warren college senior and Project Trashion coordinator Ashley Ferrer said. “We wanted to reach out to students who are creative, and we wanted to put on something that was a bit more social and creative at the same time. ”
The show will open with designs from Joy Fabiano, 
Simply Defined, O’Neill, Billabong, Maitri, Niksters Bikinis, Sela Wear, The Verde Bag and Flashback Recycled Fashions.
Simply Defined, founded earlier this year by profes-
sional designer Angela Du — who herself will don an outfit made of aluminum cans — will be debuting a line of green dresses fashioned out of everything from brown paper bags to plastic water bottles and newspapers.
“I hope that people see that recycling and being all 
about the green can be sexy, ” Du said. “I feel like there’s a certain stereotype on people who are eco-friendly, and I don’t think they have to be people who are activists. It can be anybody … every little bit helps. ” 
Seventeen student designers have expressed interest 
in entering the show. With the addition of professional designers, the runway will feature about 30 sustainable outfits and accessories. 
Ferrer said the student entries do not have to be as pol-
ished as those of the professional designers, and that judg-ing will not be based on complexity or intricacy of design. Garments and accessories will be judged by Sustainability Coordinator Maggie Souder, Sustainability Analyst at the Sustainability Solutions Institute Kristin Blackler and one other judge, who is yet to be determined. 
Those who rock the categories of best use of recyclable 
materials, best use of sustainable materials and best use of household materials will take home complementary passes to the San Diego Natural History Museum.
“We’re not rewarding a first place or second place 
and we’re not here to say who can come up with the best design, ” Ferrer said. “Some people are professionals and that’s great. I’m completely challenged and wouldn’t be able to hem a hole in my clothes, but I can probably throw something together … If someone wants to make a bottle-cap necklace, that’s awesome, trendy, and reasonable. ”
Although she has undertaken a few design projects 
before, Sixth College junior Jacqueline Tran admits that the thought of sewing plastic grocery bags together made her reluctant to enter the show. The top of her dress will be made of scrunched plastic grocery bags to create ruching, and the bottom will be made of tulle from an old Halloween costume and crushed soda cans cinched together with string and ribbon instead of thread.
“I liked the whole ‘taking things out of the recycling bin’

her final Trashion design. Below:  Design house Joy Fabiano will show their handbags at Trashion.Though illegal under federal law, 13 states — including California — per-mit the use of marijuana for medical 
purposes. 
During former President George W . 
Bush’s tenure, the federal government set a precedent of overriding state laws and raiding legal medical marijauna dispensa-ries. On March 18, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, on behalf of President Barack Obama, assured the nation that federal laws banning medical marijuana will not interfere with individual state regulations; however, Drug Enforcement Administration raids on California dis-pensaries in recent months have proved-notherwise.
Dispensaries have sprouted ubiqui-
tously to meet growing demand, due largely to the affordability of the drug compared to standard pharmaceuticals, seeing as at least 45 million Americans under the age of 65 don’t have access to affordable health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
On April 14, 2009, Americans for Safe 
Access, a national advocacy organization with more than 30,000 members in 40 states, challenged the validity of the longstand-ing federal assertion that “marijuana has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. ” ASA called the statement — issued by the Department of Health and Human Services under the Bush administra-tion — outdated and reactionary. 
ASA claims marijuana to be an effective pain 
reliever for various ailments, including muscu-lar dystrophy and glaucoma. Additionally, stud-ies conducted within the California Medical Marijuana Research Program, established by the University of California, have demonstrat-ed that the drug restores the appetites of nause-ated patients with AIDS and cancer.
However, several federal regulations and 
restrictions on not only distribution, but also research grants and access to approved research-grade crops, prevent large-scale stud-ies from being conducted effectively.
“The federal government is in a position 
where they have a double standard on medical cannabis, ” said Kris Hermes, a public relations representative for ASA. “They refuse to admit there is medical value to the plant itself, but even officials who work for National Institute on Drug Abuse claim that its components have medical value. ”
Last year, Mark Wallace, professor of anes-
thesiology at the UCSD School of Medicine, studied the pain-relieving quality of tetra-hydrocannabinol (THC), a potent chemical found in the marijuana plant, by injecting patients with the pain-producer capsaicin — a pepper extract — after they had inhaled the drug. He concluded that a balance must be reached for marijuana to effectively decrease pain, and that too much can actually increase pain. Currently, Wallace is studying the effects of marijuana on patients with diabetes.
“With the center for medicinal marijuana 
research, we’re coming out with some good studies, but it’s only the beginning, and the prob-lem is that they’re single-site studies, ” Wallace said. “In order to get really good evidence, you need multicenter, blinded, randomized studies with lots of patients. If you’re doing multicenter studies from different states, then you have to deal with different state laws, so it makes it very challenging. Until the federal government lifts their restrictions, it’s going to be extremely dif-ficult to study. ”

NEW  DEAL
California’s medical-marijuana 
community hopes a newhands-off promise from the federal government holdswater — and doesn’t goup in smoke.

The federal government has placed 
heavy restrictions on medical marijua-
na research, including a provision lim-iting the cultivation of research-grade marijuana to only ElSohly Laboratories, Incorporated — a private government-sponsored company in Mississippi. 
Wallace said this grants complete 
regulatory power to the government regarding the approval of any study, a process that stalled his own research for more than two years. 
Five years ago, ASA filed charges 
against the Department of Health and Human Services for distributing false information to the public regarding the medicinal value of marijuana. 
Because no action was taken, the 
organization filed suit again in 2007, arguing that the federal government was guilty of breaking its own Data Quality Act, a law “ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by federal agencies. ” 
The lawsuit was rejected later that 
year by the U.S. District Court. 
Despite research supporting the 
use of marijuana as a pain reliv-er, gleaned through studies like Wallace’s, the federal government has been slow to reverse its longstand-ing classification of marijuana as a Schedule 1 substance, for which there is no accepted medical use.
“The health sciences have indi-
cated that marijuana can be a useful pain reliever for some people who do not respond to other medications, ” said political science professor David Mares, who specializes in interna-tional drug trafficking, politics and policy. “If science were the basis of our marijuana laws, its classifica-tion in our Schedule of Controlled Substances would have to be altered to permit medicinal use. Of course, if science were the basis of our drug laws, tobacco would be a Schedule 1 substance: highly addictive, no cur-
rently accepted medical use in the U.S. and no safe way to use it under medical supervision. ”
Lawyers for the organization sat 
before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 14 to appeal the lower court’s 2007 decision, claiming it was based on conservative values and politics rather than tangible scientific evidence. They also said that disregarding abundant scientific studies contradicts the new administration’s promise.
“What amazes me is that mar-
ijuana is illegal for medicinal use in this country, yet there are other drugs that are much more risky and have much more abuse potential than marijuana: narcotics, opiates, mor-phine-like drugs … and yet those are legal for medicinal uses, ” Wallace said. “There’s no known lethal dosage of marijuana, but there’s a clear lethal dose of the opiates. ”

as opposed to using hemp [to make the garment] because I’m not very good at just sewing — I would rather just put something together, ” Tran said. “[Project Trashion] kind of reminded me of ‘Derelicte’ from Zoolander so I took inspiration from that. ”
Sanchez, who sews as a hobby and 
has her own crafting blog, feels more comfortable with her newspaper dress design than Tran and even plans to incorporate plastic grocery bags. She has also been experimenting with gro-cery bags and heat, ironing sheets of plastic together to create thicker mate-rial. Sanchez hopes the show will alert guests to the ways they can conserve.
“There will be a lot of cool stuff 
there to look at, but realistically, you can’t wear a newspaper dress every day. But you can go to thrift stores and learn how to sew and be cre-ative, ” Sanchez said. “If not, I hope that people know that the companies that they do shop at are starting to have sustainable options and they can shift their buying practices to that. ”
Project Trashion will showcase its 
philanthropic side through a silent auc-tion to raise money for Sacred Heart Secondary School in Uganda through the organization Schools for Schools, a subset of Invisible Children, which has a chapter at UCSD. The event is free to attend, but students can purchase raffle tickets for a chance to win sustainable products donated by the show’s profes-sional designers. This swag includes a gift card to Flashbacks Recycled 
Fashions; a Verde Bag starter kit (one shopping bag, one medium produce bag, one small gift wrapping cloth); a gift bag of sustainable products from the UCSD Bookstore; T-shirts and bags from Nikster Bikinis and body products from L ’Occitane and the Body Shop.
All proceeds will help renovate 
Sacred Heart’s facilities; buy textbooks, art and sports materials; promote clean water and sanitation and purchase classroom technology.
 “We wanted to put something on 
that could accomplish the two goals of environmentalism and social justice, ” Ferrer said. “It’s really an engaging and interactive conclusion to Earth Week. ”

SITESEENRALPHS
CANDY AISLE
I am standing between two solid walls of candy. My fingers twitch slightly. Three chubby preteens 
eagerly stuff gummy bears and malted milk balls into their gaping maws. They stop when they see me staring. I nod in approval and they quickly resume their gluttonous ritual.  
With bloodshot eyes, I hungrily 
scan my surroundings. Two bong loads ago I was unsure whether I would find the Ralph’s candy aisle to be as tanta-lizing as my colleagues had described it. I have visited many a candy shop in my life, after all. How could a mere supermarket contain any bounty more impressive than the chocolate peddlers of London or the delectable display I witnessed at the Jelly Belly factory as a child? 
Now, thoroughly blazed and strick-
en by the weed-induced hunger I’ve come to know and love so well, I real-ize I was wrong to have ever doubted this place. 
I make my way over to a bin full 
of Swedish fish and carefully lift the plastic lid. Paranoid, I quickly glance up and down the aisle before shoving a small handful of the rubbery morsels into my mouth. Bliss.
I have found few things in this 
world that taste better than free candy. My rotund candy-aisle com-patriots seem to agree. They have far outpaced me in this race. I scramble to catch up, diving headlong into bin after bin of chocolate-covered gummy bears, sour watermelons, sugar-coated worms and those little deer-shit drops of minty chocolate that the elderly seem to like so much.
“Where the fuck are the Swedish 
fish?” one of them ponders aloud. 
I point him in the right direction. 
His vulgarity is understandable in this setting — hoarding candy is some serious fucking business. There is little room for niceties when buckets of crystalized sugar are at stake.
Four licorice ropes, a fistful of sour 
bears and 16 gumballs later, I dis-cover something called pebbles. Just pebbles. No further description neces-sary. They look like rocks and they are fucking delicious. 
If you do nothing else on this holi-
est of stoner days, pack a bowl of your stickiest stash (I went with a delightful little strain called Purple Nice) and head over to Ralphs. Look out for lurk-ing red polos and don’t forget to try the pebbles.5MLQKIT5IZQR]IVI;\]LQM[0QVLMZMLJa.MLMZIT4I_

Based on Naomi Klein’s book, Shock Doctrine, and John Perkins’ book, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, Criscenzo reveals how the IMF, World Bank, and US Federal Reserve have been complicit in using crisis and creat-ing crisis to funnel the majority of the world’s wealth to the privileged few.  5 pm in Biology Rm 1103 – Muir College.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — No. 10 UCSD 
completed its historic season this weekend at 
RIMAC Arena, edged by No. 8 Long Beach State University in four sets and sweeping Grand Canyon University in the season finale. Clinging  to playoff hopes, the Tritons fell short in the last two sets against Long Beach State. The game ended in a score of 28-30, 30-26, 31-29, 30-28, closing the book on conference play. On Saturday, the Tritons played their final game of the season in an emotional sweep of Grand Canyon.
The Tritons came into Friday night clinging to 
the hope that they could somehow squeak into the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoffs. In order for the dominoes to fall in place, UCSD had to beat Long Beach State and get some help from other MPSF teams playing contests last weekend. 
Unfortunately, the Tritons could not hold 
their end of the bargain against the 49ers.
UCSD brought its A-game into RIMAC 
Friday night, but the 49ers came in with an inten-sity fueled by their previous loss to the Tritons. With the playoffs in sight for both teams, an all-out battle ensued.
The first set was a telling preview, as it includ-
ed 13 ties and six lead changes. The 49ers jumped ahead 20-15 before the Tritons came storming back to tie it up at 24. Later, with the score tied at 27, senior middle blocker Gerald Houseman sent down a kill and Ross followed with one of his own, forcing a set point. Junior opposite Frank Fritsch then sealed set one with a kill at 30-28 for the Tritons.
The second set saw Long Beach State outhit 
the Tritons .323 to .167, allowing the 49ers to take the momentum in the game after a 30-26 win.
The third set was another war, featuring 15 ties 
and seven lead changes. Down 28-27, Houseman sent down back-to-back kills to give UCSD a 29-28 advantage. But, the 49ers took advantage of a UCSD error and won the set on an ace.
The fourth set saw 15 ties and eight lead 
changes, as the Tritons refused to go down with-out a fight in their home court with the playoffs on the line. Tied at 28, a 49er kill and UCSD error became the torpedos that sank the Triton ship.
“I definitely think we fought pretty hard, ” 
Houseman said. “We had a few lapses but Long Beach played really well. We were satisfied with our performance, just not the result. ”
In the Tritons’ final conference game, Fritsch 
sent down 20 kills, Houseman had 13 kills and Spangler added 12 kills. Ross posted nine kills and seven blocks while sophomore setter Phil Bannan added 54 assists, 10 digs and seven blocks.
The final games highlighted UCSD men’s vol-
leyball senior weekend, as libero Eric Leserman, opposite Aaron Hedland and Houseman were honored in a pregame ceremony.
In the season finale versus Grand Canyon, 
the seniors translated their final game nostal-gia into intensity. Led by Leserman, Hedland and Houseman, the Tritons swept the Antelopes 30-12, 30-20, 30-20.
UCSD came storming out of the gates in the 
first set, scoring the first eight points behind a service run from Spangler. UCSD led 19-5 on Hedland and Ross kills. Houseman sent down the match point for the win at 30-12.
In the second set, Grand Canyon opened to 
a 5-3 lead before the Tritons strung together a run. With the score tied at 10, the Tritons scored nine of the next 10 points to take command. Houseman stepped up again and closed the door on set two 30-12. 
The Tritons carried the early momentum 
into the third set, looking for a sweep. UCSD put together another impressive run, scoring nine straight points on a service run from junior oppo-site hitter Peter Johnson to break the set wide open. Houseman then ended what he started, putting the set away for the sweep at 30-20.The game was fittingly led by the seniors 
as Hedland sent down a match-high 16 kills, Houseman added nine kills on .667 hitting and Leserman laid out for six digs. As a team, UCSD hit at .451 and held Grand Canyon to an embarassing .025 hitting percentage.
The Tritons end their 2009 campaign with 
a school record 13 wins (13-15). Turning heads all year long, UCSD upset multiple MPSF teams, 
establishing itself as a true conferece contender.
“It’s definitely nice that we’ve been improving 
our record every year, but it obviously would have been impressive to make the playoffs, ” Houseman said. “It would have been nice especially in my senior year to go out like that. ”

MEN’S GOLF — Walking out of 
the coaches’ meeting the day before the California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship, men’s golf head coach Mike Wydra was shocked and dismayed.
His team, which arrived at Paso 
Robles, Calif., thinking it had already qualified for next month’s NCAA Division-II Super Regionals, was thrown a curve ball yesterday afternoon: The Tritons lost their automatic berth.
The top 10 
teams in the region qualify for the NCAA Division-II Super Regionals. Rankings had originally been deter-mined by a team’s head-to-head play against other teams in the region. At the meeting, Wydra was informed that 
the selection committee is now con-
sidering how a team performs against other ranked teams in its region. 
“We were on a conference call and 
the gentleman informed us of the changes, ” Wydra said. “He ran down the list of teams that had qualified and we weren’t on it anymore. We should’ve known about these changes 
beforehand. ”
The change in qualification moved 
the Tritons from a guaranteed spot in 
the Super Regionals to a win-or-go-home situation. UCSD must now win the conference tournament to qualify as a team for the Super Regionals, although two individuals have already done so. Wydra believes junior Raj Samra and sophomore Keith Okasaki’s scores should earn them a spot in the Super Regionals with senior Billy Olsen on the outside looking in. However, nothing is set in stone.
“We won’t know anything for sure 
until the conference call on Thursday, ” 
he said.
Despite the 
new develop-ments, Wydra and the Tritons are not increasing prac-tice time, though their mindset has 
changed.
A shaky spring season may be 
one reason these changes affected the Tritons so greatly. UCSD has finished middle-of-the-pack in each tourna-ment with its top finish, a sixth place, coming in Texas at the St. Edwards Invitational.
But seemingly mediocre finishes 
are skewed by the fact that UCSD plays in arguably the best conference in the nation, Wydra said.
“So many of the teams in our con-
ference and region are highly ranked, ” he said. “If we were somewhere else, we would be kicking butt right now. But the tougher conference works to our advantage as it raises our level of play. We’ve made a lot of progress [this spring] and we expect to play well this week. ”
The tough conference is now the 
Tritons’ Achilles heel. This week’s CCAA Championship will include the No. 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 ranked teams in the Western Region, all of which the Tritons must beat to avoid missing postseason as a team for the second straight year.
“The top teams have five players to 
count on while we’re still looking for a fourth and fifth, ” he said. “But we’re every bit as good as those top teams. ”
The Tritons have experi-
ence on their side in the CCAA Championships, returning to the same Hunter Ranch Golf Course that many players have seen before. Seniors Olsen and Ryan Bailey will be making their third trip to the course; Okasaki will be making his second. 
“This course doesn’t require a lot 
of length off the tee, ” Bailey said. “It’s about course management: knowing where to place the ball off the tee and on the green to avoid big numbers. Being here before is a big help. ”
But the loss of senior Nathan Phan, 
who could not devote the time needed to compete on the team this year, has created a big hole in the Triton lineup. Phan was the low scorer for UCSD the 
past two seasons at this event, finishing 
ninth
 last year and 13th the year before.
“[Nathan] would’ve been our fifth 
man, ” Wydra said, referring to this season’s lineup. “Playing golf at a high level requires a large time commit-ment and he just didn’t have time. There’s no way to replace his kind of skill and character. ”
Despite Phan’s exit, the Tritons still 
have a solid trio at the top to lead the way. Samra has played quality golf all season and is expected to play well 
on the Hunter Ranch course. Okasaki 
and Olsen will round out the top three for the Tritons. 
Wydra expects freshman Justin 
Gabbert, who played his way into the lineup, to surprise some people this week. Team captain Bailey will round out the roster for the championships, and is helping Gabbert acclimate to the overwhelming championship 
atmosphere.
“I talked to Justin last night and 
told him to not put any additional 
pressure on himself trying to justify why he is here and not other, more experienced players, ” Bailey said. “I told him that he is here for a reason and we already trust him. I expect Justin to be a dark horse in this tour-nament. ” 
Bailey added that the law of aver-
ages says that both he and Samra should play well this week since they have both been off their game the past 
few tournaments.
The Hunter Ranch Golf Course 
will play close to 7,000 yards, con-
sidered a medium-length course for college players today. The course fea-tures four par fives, three of which are reachable in two and one of the keys to playing well, according to Wydra.
UCSD tees off this morning at 
7:30 a.m. in the first of two Monday 
rounds. They will play the final round 
on April 21.
