After a year of protesting outside UC 
Board of Regents meetings and firing 
insults at UC President Mark Yudof, stu-dent activists have turned their atten-tion — and well-honed flyering skills  — toward Sacramento, with a ballot initiative called the California Democracy Act.
The initiative, drafted by UC Berkeley 
linguistics professor George Lakoff, would reduce the two-thirds legislative majority required to make any budgetary decision to a simple majority.
According to Lakoff, if budget and rev-
enue proposals require support from only 50 percent of legislators in the assembly and senate, much of the budget gridlock would be alleviated, and the government would be able to increase statewide rev-enue more easily. 
Lakoff said he hopes that some of 
that extra revenue would make its way to the UC system. Chris Ah San, Student Organizing Director of the California Democracy Act Coalition, agreed.
“There’s a systemic problem with the 
way budgets are made that leads to the fact that we can’t get any funding for educa-tion, ” Ah San said. “Basically, the way we understand it, none of the problems that students are facing right now can be fixed without fixing this first. ”

The Coalition of University 
Employees — representing 14,000 
UC-wide clerical employees — filed an unfair labor practice claim to the Public Employment Relations Board last September, after the UC Office of the President announced it would be implementing temporary layoffs. 
While waiting for a ruling, CUE 
and UCOP temporarily agreed on the terms of the layoffs last month. Under the plan, CUE employees who otherwise would have been laid off this year will instead receive a 4-to-6 percent pay cut. These pay cuts will be expressed in the form of tempo-rary layoffs, or mandated off-work without pay. 
CUE chose to exclude its approxi-
mate 14,000 employees from the faculty furlough plan, approved by the UC Board of Regents last July. Effective Aug. 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, the furlough plan requires 18 days off-days per academic year 
and is projected to save $184 million. 
Although the faculty furlough 
plan was meant to represent all 
employees, unionized employees could negotiate implementation through collective bargaining.
The main perk of the CUE-
UCOP agreement, effective Feb. 2, is paycheck consistency. Instead of a direct pay cut being employed at once or during the period of off-days, the plan allows employees to dis-perse this cut throughout the year by receiving consistent monthly salary reductions despite the reduced work schedule. 
The university is projected to save 
$13 million over a 12-month period. 
Although CUE’s bargaining team 
is attempting to fight the temporary layoffs as a whole, they still negoti-ated the terms of a temporary layoff program to help benefit their mem-bers as much as possible. 
Temporary layoffs have been a 
topic of discussion since all faculty furlough negotiations began last July. UCOP Associate Director of Labor Relations Peter Chester worked with CUE’s bargaining team to negotiate the agreement. 
“In some form or another, this 
has been going on since July, ” Chester said. “We started out by negotiat-ing over the furloughs, and those 
negotiations went on for months. But when it became clear we weren’t 
going to find an agreement on that, we began bargaining over the impact of the temporary layoffs. And those negotiations were completed within a matter of weeks. ”
The plan also encourages sched-
uling of off-days  on the same dates as regular university closure days, in order to minimize disturbance of university operations. 
“In the absence of having them 
coincide, the employees would have to use vacation days [or] compensa-tory time off, if they want to be paid for the time, or use leave without pay, ” Chester said. 
The Dec. 10 agreement marked 
the immediate implementation of the plan for Cue employees; according-ly, the majority of these layoff dates occurred during the winter holiday closure. The rest of the days off will fall on other closure dates scattered throughout the remainder of the year, and ordinary working days where necessary.
“If an employee who is taking a

 After a long seven months under 
construction, the Student Center’s best-loved saloon is dusting the dirt off its swankier, second skin.
One week from this Thursday on Jan. 14, 
Porters’s Pub will be hosting a grand-opening bash to debut their recently renovated kitchen and bar. In dutiful compliance with its lease agreement, the pub has revamped its historic digs with shiny new sports-bar semblances. 
Since indoor facilities went under the knife 
last May, the pub has kept up appearances on its open-air patio, with a fully functional bar opposite the stage and servers to keep business running smoothly during development. Now that renovations are finally complete, owner Stephen Lawler and his team are expecting to attract a lager amount of students looking to grab a bite to eat or kick back after classes.

A delegation of nine scientists and 
graduate students from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography brought a scientific eye to the political United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen last month, where various solutions to global warming were under examination.         International delegates and politi-cal leaders attended the conference to negotiate policy  regarding the global impact of climate change. The con-vention aimed to create a worldwide emissions agreement that would serve as the successor to the 1998 Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. However, that goal was not reached.         The Scripps delegation was sent to the meeting, held from Dec. 7 to Dec.18, by the UC Revelle Program on Climate Science and Policy. The scientists and students hoped to accurately represent the scientific background of global warming, cre-ate public awareness about scientific issues and show that researchers are concerned with the political aspects involved in their field.      The scientists participated in press conferences, panel discussions, pre-sentations and side events, discuss-ing topics from ocean acidification and black carbon to rising sea levels caused by greenhouse gas emissions. 
 At the event, the delegation set 
up an exhibit explaining how excess carbon dioxide causes the ocean to acidify, endangering the habitat of marine organisms. Professor of bio-logical oceanography Victoria Fabry and professor of marine chemistry Andrew Dickson also spoke on this topic during a panel discussion.          Afterward, the team made its mark at the U.S. State Department Pavilion, where President Obama and his cabinet members were in attendance. Distinguished professor of climate and atmospheric sciences Veerabhadran Ramanathan presented his findings on the negative climate effects of black carbon, created by burning diesel and wood in wood-burning stoves. Ramanathan also highlighted the benefits of using cleaner, more efficient technologies and fuels.        Scripps director Tony Haymet and distinguished professor of geochemis-try Ray Weiss spoke at a press confer-ence and proposed a way to bridge the gap between actual and reported greenhouse gas emissions. Weiss sug-gested using independent emission verifications, in which reports do not vary by region or country but instead are globally standardized.            Approximately 40,000 people from 192 countries attended the event, rep-resenting governments, businesses, special-interest organizations and 
universities.       “To have students there who are scientists to be able to explain the science is very important, ” Tamara Beitzel, a doctoral candidate for phys-ical oceanography at Scripps, said. “We are the future leaders. [Political leaders] need to be able to interact with us and pass on their knowledge to us. ”      Weiss stressed the importance of incorporating scientific finding into political and business operations.       “In some cases, it’s the environ-mentalists against the businesses, but in a lot of cases, that isn’t true, ” Weiss said. “There are a lot of businesses who want to do the right thing, and they need information that they can trust. In that sense, it’s been a great success because the word is getting out. ”

Though our time spent away 
at college is supposed to con-stitute the golden years, the 
mystical forces of res-life offices and Craigslist ads have been known to put a damper on your fun: They’re the ones responsible for your god-awful roommate. 
To avoid the hassle of moving 
into new digs, though, it’s preferable to fight back, treating your in-house potbellied nudist with the same unsa-vory medicine you’ve been force-fed until he can’t take it anymore.
Here, How-to Guru examines the 
careful art of roommate evacuation. 
The first obvious investment for 
any hopeful evictor: a bumpin’ sound system. It’s important to first deter-mine what kind of music will most irritate your roommate, as it would be an utter waste to spend half an hour blasting System of a Down only to learn that the Dungeons & Dragons fanatic with whom you share a toilet is actually into them. Once you’ve finally hit a nerve, milk Mariah Carey’s falsetto for all it’s worth; there’s no time quite like 7 a.m. for a croaky “Fantasy” sing-along. 
 Of course, just you and Mariah 
won’t suffice. If a new roommate’s invading your territory, capitalize on the fact that this is your  home, 
and that your toenail clippings won’t be leaving the living-room carpet anytime soon. A few stray toilet-seat pubic hairs might be kind of gross; an outright refusal to shut the bathroom door during business time, however, is the stuff of eviction champions. 
On that note, outrageous dis-
plays of disregard for cleanliness are generally safe bets — but only those capable of testing your roommate’s kindness. Don’t refrain from bathing unless you can commit until a colony of flies encircle your head like an insectan halo. Instead, consider giv-ing up on dishwashing; the higher the stack of Pizza Pocket-encrusted plates left to haunt your roommate’s dreams, the better. 
The separate but comparably effec-
tive tactic of uncomfortable flirtation also works wonders. Come home drunk — or, for optimum creepiness, completely sober — and feign attrac-tion to this roommate or his/her sig-nificant other, even if he/she possesses all the sexual allure of roadkill. 
 Don’t attempt such a daring 
play unless you’ve got serious acting chops. Bursting into giggles mid-come-on will only make you into the dick, which will only prompt revenge. The objective, after all, is not to wreck your roommate rela-tionship; it’s to end it definitively, with no turning back — not even for those stale Twinkies he left in your side of the pantry.
Most importantly, though, don’t 
be deterred by initial feelings of embarrassment at your newfound inconsideration. Y ou may not be roll-ing out the welcome mat, but by the time your humble abode no longer reeks of nudist musk, you’ll be too relieved to worry about guilt.

STATE NEWS —  Mere weeks after the UC  
Board of Regents approved a 32-percent fee 
hike, a group of UC students and faculty have stashed away their “Lay off Yudof ” picket signs and shifted their sights to higher ground: the California congressional floor. 
Authored by UC Berkeley professor of 
linguistics George Lakoff, the California Democracy Act would allow legislative decisions regarding government spending to be passed by a simple majority, rather than the current two-thirds super majority. A simple 14-word change to the California constitution might not be a permanent solution to the UC budget crisis, but the bill would be a giant leap forward for our dysfunctional legislative system. 
In 1978, Proposition 13 amended the California Constitution to require a two-thirds majority vote on every finance-related bill. But 32 years later, California finds itself in an eco-nomic gridlock. With the deciding vote thrust into the hands of a one-third legislative minor-ity, the budget isn’t often passed on time, and public services have been  cut as a result. 
When the California Master Plan for Higher 
Education  was designed in 1960, its goal was 
to make public higher education free to all California residents. Since then, however, UC student fees have ballooned from $147 a year to above $10,000 for the 2010-11 academic year — largely due to dwindling state funds. Legislative measures to financially support higher educa-tion seldom meet two-thirds approval.
Instead of placing the power in the hands of the majority, the current system signs power away into the hands of a few dissenting legisla-tors. With only a simple majority needed, state legislators would be able to pass the budget a lot sooner — and the sooner the budget is passed, the sooner public institutions (the UC system included) get their handouts. 
As it stands, California has the only state 
constitution that requires the two-thirds majority. And while there’s no guarantee that this reform would be a reliable boost to public education, there’s evidence it might help. Before Proposition 13, our schools consistently ranked in the top three in the country; today, according to UCLA researchers, we’ve fallen to 48th.

The near Christmas tragedy this year has resulted in even tighter airport measures, as promised by 
President Obama in the past week.  
But travelers already undergo scrupulous safety 
measures, ranging from the removal of shoes in security lines to the prohibition of  electronics dur-ing specified durations of the flight. Y et these security measures have yet to save us from another threat. If the bomb’s not wedged inside the toe of a shoe, it’s strapped beneath someone’s boxers. 
Even if the TSA introduces a more extensive body 
search, we’ll still be one step behind the next bomb-
concealing innovation. Travel will never fully be 
secure, but security has to be more aware of subtle,  instinctual signs of bad in tent to trace the mechani-
cally undetectable.

When the U.S. was warned about pos-sible hijackers before 9/11, our gov-
ernment stood by idly — and still it seems that, despite a decade’s worth of pre-flight pat-downs, airport security is a little slow on the uptake.
Like the 9/11 terrorists, Abdulmutallab 
checked in with no bags and paid cash for his plane ticket, something that should have — but didn’t — at least calmly alert airport officials. And, like the 9/11 terror-ists, the U.S. government had been given 
several obvious warnings. 
Thankfully, the final outcome wasn’t 
nearly so disastrous this time around — 
but if the same threat indicators continue to go unchecked, we won’t be nearly so lucky next time around.

Associate Opinion EditorThe failed Christmas-day bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 raises doubts about American 
intelligence abroad.
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab — the Nigerian man 
who made it onto a flight to Detroit with an explosive in his underwear — wasn’t necessarily subtle in his attempt to blow his flight up, yet most hints were overlooked. Abdulmutallab wrote about his fantasy of becoming a Muslim holy warrior in public online posts. Shouldn’t a man whose father altered the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria about the possibility of his son’s violent intentions and whose name was on a coun-terterrorism watch list have at least been stopped at security? Apparently the National Counterterrorism Center, which unites every scrap of evidence on suspects, missed the memo; Abdulmutallab made it aboard the plane scot-free.
President Obama blamed Abdulmutallab’s pres-
ence on the flight to a communication breakdown among intelligence agencies — Abdulmutallab, he said, should have been on a no-fly list. 
No shit.With terrorists constantly employing new attack 
methods — first the shoe bombs, then the water bottles and now the clever explosive-underwear approach — the U.S. Transportation Security Administration is struggling to keep up. The intel-ligence network must act more preemptively at inter-national locations, or it runs the risk of more success-ful terror attacks in the future.

Dear Editor,
It has been over a month since A.S. 
Council issued its vote nullifying the 
chances of having a University Centers Advisory Board Winter Quarter referendum concerning the Loft. As both a Sixth College freshman sena-tor and A.S. Sixth College senator, I have had two years of experience with the bureaucratic labyrinth that is A.S. Council. In this discussion of the cur-rent council’s position on the Loft, my experience with A.S. allows me to testify to its own hypocrisy concerning student involvement on this campus. 
For those of you who haven’t vis-
ited the Loft, it is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to this campus. Students can come to free world-class shows with the Loft’s Pay As Y ou Can (PAYC) method of pay-ment. With the combined Loft staff of students and professional planners, this space offers true real-world pro-duction opportunities for everyone involved. Students at the Loft are paid, but anyone who wants to learn about and support the arts can help through the Loft Street Team. As an all-inclu-sive endeavor, anyone can be a part of the Loft and contribute to making it an even better place. 
The public university system’s real-
ity is its profound lack of funding. The Loft, like so many other organizations on campus, does not have permanent funding and would need a referen-dum by Winter Quarter 2010 to main-tain the same level of programming. The proposed fee of $4.65 per quarter has been calculated to ensure sustain-able programming for the Loft. The normal cost for unsubsidized shows is about $10 per person. By support-ing this referendum, one could pay more or less the same for a year of free shows rather than for just one.  To solve one of A.S. Council’s 
many supposed problems with how the UCAB is supported, a Loft refer-endum proposal was presented, but was marked as having no student oversight. Student oversight is another way of saying A.S. oversight. Those elected to positions within A.S. don’t like the idea of a space on campus, creating student community and cam-pus life, without their involvement. By not allowing the campus to vote on a referendum, A.S. Council is prevent-ing students from actually having a voice before they even have a chance to vote. Delaying the vote to Winter Quarter and thus forcing it to appear on a referendum in the Spring forces the Loft to stop offering what its cam-puswide following has come to expect.
The potential Winter Quarter Loft 
referendum was shot down due to lack of student control, not enough information and a rushed and incom-plete presentation. These reasons for voting it down are incorrect. The Loft staff had been working with UCAB since last year on the referendum and the supposed fair debate and deliber-ating was quickly controlled, censored and decided by A.S. higher-ups before the discussion even began. The voice of the student body — the people who will actually have to pay for the Loft and can vote yes or no of their own accord — are not being heard.

Even if it allowed the UC system 
to get its hands on state funding 
sooner, though, the CDA isn’t a cure-all to the UC budget crisis; it will obviously only benefit the UC system as long as the majority is in favor of our cause. The coalition hopes that once a simple majority has control, it’ll levy taxes, and some of that tax revenue will run off into the UC sys-tem — but that’s far from guaranteed.
In fact, the bill could hurt higher 
education even more. This past June, a proposal to further reduce funding for education failed before the state senate. But without Proposition 13’s two-thirds majority requirement, the 25-14 vote would have been enough to cut funding to even more ridicu-lous lows — and the university would find itself even deeper in the hole. 
On UC campuses across the 
state, students are rallying support for the bill. At UCSD, A.S. campus-wide senator Wafa Ben Hassine, our CDA Coalition chapter coordinator, will be harnessing the support of students and faculty by presenting petitions.
Because the Attorney General 
approved the initiative over winter break, Hassine said, the initiative is just now taking off. Hassine just began collecting signatures last Friday, but she’s already confident they’ll meet their million-signature mark by the April deadline. In addi-tion to public support, Hassine explains that many public officials 
have already given their endorse-ments and support to the act.
While this grassroots effort has a 
less-than-promising 10 to 15 people currently involved on campus, its intentions are in the right place: It is indeed time we quit antagoniz-ing the regents and knock directly on the state capitol’s door. But the efforts can’t stop here; for any kind of lasting change, we’ll need to lobby legislators and voters to prioritize higher education. Their lack of sup-port is, after all, the real root of the UC system’s problems — no matter 
how much red tape we cut to make their jobs easier.

sion stand, ” Lawler said. “But we’re opening it up 
to a full bar and grill to accommodate the student community here. ”
The latest construction is the first major reno-
vation to the space since February 2008, when Lawler and Moses Muñoz took over management of the pub from its original owner and namesake, UCSD alumnus Rob Porter. Their original lease agreement with the university stipulated they must renovate indoor amenities on their own dime while the university would refurbish the roof and add new paneling.
As a student at UCSD in the early ’90s, Porter 
decided he wanted to re-open the Triton Pub  — as it was known during the ’70s and ’80s — after a four-year hiatus. 
When university officials began construction 
of the Price Center in the late ’80s, they decided 
to close the Triton Pub so they could advertise 
the space currently occupied by Round Table 
Pizza as the only on-campus location with an 
alcohol license. 
Consequently, the owners of the Triton Pub 
decided they didn’t want to participate in the bidding war for the new space, and called it quits. 
In 1992, officials rethought the closure, opting 
to re-establish the lease for a pub on the funkier side of campus. Porter, who had been interested in 
creating a student business and was eager to create 
a space for students to hang out, made an offer. 
In June 1992, shortly after graduating, Porter 
received a call from the university informing him that his proposal had been selected. 
“Going to school, I always wanted a cool, little bit 
more of a hangout kind of a place, ” Porter said.
In Porter’s day, the pub was one full, contiguous 
space — without the dividing walls that now define the stage room, kitchen and bathroom areas. 
The university finished making renovations to the 
space in 1993, when Porter officially began managing the pub. At that time, the pub only consisted of the bar and bathroom areas — 1,300 sq. ft. at the front of the building. 
In 1995 however, the university agreed to expand 
the lease, handing off the additional stage and patio areas to Porter’s community vision. 
After over a decade at the Pub’s helm, Porter decid-
ed to move on. In 2008, Lawler and Muñoz officially took the wheel. 
The new management team has hired fewer stu-
dents than Porter, opting for a full-time staff behind the scenes in the kitchen and up front at the bar. 
“The pub used to exclusively employee their stu-
dents, or as in my case, UCSD alumni, ” said Steve Y ork, a former Porter’s Pub employee. 
According to Y ork, the decision to hire less students 
changed the pub’s atmosphere. 
David McClearly, who recently graduated last year 
and still stops by twice a day, also worked at the pub 
from April 2008 to April 2009. According to McClearly, 
the pub’s menu expansion in early 2008 helped bring in a lot of customers despite the price increase on beers. He said he expects the recent renovations will do much of the same.

finished by the end of Fall Quarter, 
many of the bar’s interior amenities have been upgraded. In the kitchen, a newly equipped char broil grill has expanded food options in order to accommodate more students while the new cooling unit (which keeps beers and other stored bev-erages cold) will allow the pub to offer a wider selection of beers. By Jan. 14, the team will be coming out with a new menu. 
“Last week, I had my first carne 
asada burrito at Porter’s Pub — it’s been a long time coming, ” said Porter. “We were making meals without a full kitchen, so we were naturally limited in our menu offer-ings. ”
Though the pub’s foundational 
architecture remains much the same, most doorways have been expanded to accommodate patrons with disabilities. In the main dining area, a spotless gray wall divides the kitchen from patrons, studded with a pick-up window for food orders. 
According to bartender Luis Saenz 
— a nonstudent employee who has worked for the Pub for about a year — a roomier kitchen structure and wider walkways between the kitchen, bar and seating area have made things easier on the staff. Not only that, but the new appliances have also made recipes more manageable for the pub’s cooks.
“Before, the cooks were mak-
ing half that stuff up in their head, ” Saenz joked. 
The pub has also adopted a 
swankier, clean-cut aesthetic. Thanks to its mandatory upgrade, shoddy carpets were replaced with shiny new spill-proof flooring, the walls were painted a dark beige and Lawler threw up three new flat-screen televisions. 
According to Lawler, he also 
hopes to install an additional wine rack for faculty, students and alum-ni who aren’t beer lovers. 
Lawler said he hopes the reno-
vations will provide UCSD students — 21 or not — with more reasons to stop by the pub. The venue will be opening earlier and staying open later, with breakfast avail-able all day. In addition, Lawler said he’s looking to serve entrees inspired by traditional cuisine from the Mediterranean, the American South and other regions. 
“We wanted to change things up 
so we could offer more to the stu-dent community, ” said Lawler. 
Now that the roar of construc-
tion has faded, Lawler and his team have a new concert series in the works, in addition to a winter beer garden (building off the momen-tum of this summer’s Reggae in the Garden). 
“It’s going to be good, ” Saenz 
said. “I can’t wait to get things rol-lin’ and get more people in here. ”

JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK
SITESEEN
After a winter-break won-
derland of plastic trees and manmade explosives, it’s 
the right time you revisited some simple joys of human existence: blue skies, a warm fire and colossal rocks.
Though Joshua Tree National 
Park’s 800,000 acres of desert — scattered with bedrock boulders and Seussical shrubbery — are anything but simple, they provide ideal ground for getting back to basics. 
Each of the site’s nine camp-
grounds offers something different: a spot between some gargantuan stone, a clear view of the desert horizon or close proximity to fields brimming the park’s namesake tree. Enter through Joshua Tree’s south entrance to avoid paying $15 for a vehicle pass, then head north: The coolest campsites are near the center of the park. If it’s just you and couple of friends, try White Tank or Jumbo Rocks. If you’ve got an entire posse in tow, try Indian Cove or Sheep Pass. Or, in the unlikely event that you’re traveling with cattle, they’re allowed at Black Rock and Ryan. 
Camping fees vary depending 
on where you choose to settle, but range from $15 to $40.
There are lots of outdoorsy 
things to do at Joshua Tree besides drink beer at your camp-site. If you’re into rocks that look like human skulls, you can visit Skull Rock (check the creative moniker). If you want to climb regularly shaped rocks, there are about seven different sites at your fingertips. Most of the park’s rec-ommended day hikes are a breeze. It’s three miles roundtrip to a 49-palm oasis and four to a lost horse mine, and you can always hike up Mastodon Peak or Ryan Mountain to work off that holiday fruitcake flab.
If you’ d rather cruise the scen-
ery in your four-wheeler, try the Geology Tour road’s rough path. Beware: The further you drive, the rockier the road. Plan to return around sundown — you won’t want to miss the desert’s flashy pink sunset anymore than you’ d want to get stuck on the trail in complete darkness.
Like any of California’s national 
parks, it’s better to visit Joshua Tree in spring or fall. But it’s not impos-sible to brave the desert sands in the winter; just make sure to bring extra firewood. And blankets. Like, five of them. There’s nothing like a temperature drop to ruin a merry round of campfire kumbaya.

Proposition 13 in 1978. The main pur-pose of Prop. 13 was to reduce the high property taxes that accompanied the real-estate boom of the 1970s, and cap the percentage by which they could be increased each year. 
According to Ah San, the two-thirds 
requirement — intended to inhibit both the raising of taxes and the imposing of new ones — is partially responsible for California’s current economic strife.
“The majority of legislators … want 
to be able to raise the revenue that is necessary to fund higher education, ” Ah San said. “[But] just 34 percent of state legislators in either house in the state legislature, all they have to do is just say “No” until they get a budget that they want. ”
Last year, legislators faced off for 
months – largely along party lines – over whether they should combat California’s economic crisis by rais-ing taxes, resulting in a record-setting 85-day delay in the budget’s release.
Though Lakoff ’s proposal would 
help avoid such setbacks in the future, there is no guarantee that the initia-tive would ensure financial support for public higher education. Instead, the CDAC is appealing to students on the grounds that if new sources of revenue are found, more money will become generally available — and some of that will most likely be devoted to colleges and universities. 
The coalition is working in con-
junction with nonstudent organizers in the larger California Majority Rule campaign, and currently has a chapter at every UC campus except Riverside. Students from schools all over the state — including UC San Diego — have begun the hunt for public support and, more importantly, signatures.
The initiative can be passed by 
voters with no legislative input, but requires 694,354 signatures in the plan-ning stages in order to make it onto the November ballot. Additionally, a verification process — during which many of the signatures can be thrown out — means the coalition must aim for 1.3 million signatures by the April 15 deadline. 
Currently, according to Ah San, 
they have around 3,000. 
“We’re just organizing now, ” Lakoff 
said. “This is a last-minute grassroots effort. It was not planned in advance; there is no big money behind it … It’s just going to take a while. ”
The UCSD chapter of the CDA 
began organizing earlier this week, when a total of 15 members gathered 75 signatures on their first day of col-lecting. Chapter director Wafa Ben-Hassine said the chapter is aiming to contribute 2,000 signatures to the over-all campaign.
Opponents of the act argue that 
removing the two-thirds majority would result in higher taxes amid an economic recession, and would nega-tively impact the growth of industry.
“The two-thirds rule is the thin blue 
line protecting California from ruin-ation, ” Chris Reed, columnist for the San Diego Union-Tribune , said.
Should the campaign gather enough 
signatures by mid-April, the act will await voter approval on the Nov. 2 ballot. 
Ah San said he is optimistic about 
the initiative’s chances of passing.
“People know that it’s time for a 
change, ” Ah San said. “This is the year where we have to pass it. Otherwise we’re just going to be facing a bigger mess in California — as if it can get any worse than it is. ”

4-percent cut — which corresponds to 11 days off —uses up all the closure days at the holiday time and adds to that the days in March and perhaps June, there will be relatively few addi-tional days that would have to be taken off, ” Chester said. 
Despite these terms, CUE represen-
tatives said members are still unhap-py about the pay decrease. Further negotiations will continue later this month, with a mediator between the two groups.
“UC brought to us that salary reduc-
tion and furlough plan, and we did not agree to that, ” CUE bargaining team member Dianna Sahhar said. “They said if we don’t agree to this, we are going to lay you off temporarily instead. And we said, well, that’s illegal — that’s not bargaining, that’s the same choice. So we filed for unfair labor practice, which we have not heard the results of yet. In the meantime, what we did was we bargained the effects of the layoff. ” 
Certain campuses — including 
UCSD, UCSF and UC Davis — have rejected the CUE-UCOP plan, choosing not to implement the temporary layoffs. 
“ At UCSD, Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox is the one who said it’s unfair, ” Sahhar said. “ After break, they might be sending out temporary layoff notices, but they haven’t yet. We’ll see what hap-pens. ” 
While much negotiation still lies 
ahead, Sahhar said that members of CUE are content that, at minimum, some effects of the layoffs have been mitigated. 
“We’re all unhappy with the pay 
cuts, but our members are really happy with what we negotiated for them, ” Sahhar said. “It’s less cuts than what it would have been otherwise, and at least now they get their vacation, and at least we tried for them. Also, we put in that UCOP , and we’ll see how that goes. But if we win, our members will get their money back. ”

Green Bay gave up a whopping 50 
sacks — four times more than the 12 sacks the Indianapolis Colts have under their collective belt. It is a good thing Bret Favre isn’t at the helm in Green Bay; I would hate to see the geriatric break a hip. If the Packers want to make the cheeseh-eads happy and Lambeau-leap their way to a Super Bowl, they are going to have to cut down these lapses of concentration. The Packers’ New Y ear’s resolutions should be to stop with the brain farts, keep the yellow flags in the zebra’s pockets and con-centrate on protecting the precious arm of Aaron Rodgers instead of making his life more miserable. 
Last but not least, the Arizona 
Cardinals need to get to know each other better. It’s not uncommon to see quarterback Kurt Warner launch the ball downfield to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, who regularly comes up with the ball and a touchdown. However, on occasion, Warner has a knack for passing the ball to a player on the wrong team. The Cardinals need to remember that turnovers can transform a successful season into a disappointing playoff exit.  Need proof? We need not look further into their past than last season’s Super Bowl. Arizona, trailing 10-7, was in the Pittsburgh red zone with only 18 seconds until halftime. Then, in a moment of madness, Warner tossed the ball into the end zone, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison came up with the ball and returned it for pick-six. The Steelers took a 17-7 lead on that play, en route to their eventual 27-23 victory. Will the past come back to haunt the Cardinals? As of now, the Cardinals have a negative-five turnover differential, meaning they’ve given up five more turnovers than they’ve forced. In comparison the Packers — the Cardinals’ likely Wild Card opponent - have a turn-over differential of plus-22. That means the Cardinals must resolve to be a little less generous. Come on guys — Christmas is over already.
With that, I conclude the NFL 
team resolution list. Let’s hope they take a word from the wise — it’s the only way they’ll have a legitimate chance at lifting the Lombardi Trophy.the second night in a row.
UCSD trailed 60-58 with 2:24 
left, but Ilg came up with a steal and hit a short jumper to tie the score; Carlisle then sank her third three-pointer of the game to push the Tritons ahead.
UCSD also bagged 13 points from 
Hunter, who led the team with seven rebounds. CSUDH had three scor-ers in double figures, but fell to a 3-7 overall season record with the loss. The game was tight throughout, seeing 13 lead changes and 12 ties before the Trtins emerged victorious.
Carlisle’s clutch weekend was a con-
tinuation of an already outstanding season.   She is currently the leading Triton scorer, averaging 18.5 points per game. The sophomore guard has also been a consistent team leader in steals, assists and playing time.
The Tritons will take a shot at 
extending their record winning streak on Thursday, with a CCAA home opener against Chico State. The game  starts at 5:30 p.m. in RIMAC Arena.

the field and adding 10 of 13 free throws, along with four rebounds and three assists. After just six weeks of season play, he reached double figures in four straight games. Senior guard Tyler Acevedo added eight points to the score, while junior and freshman guards Casey Ryan and Jake Tarabilda collected an additional seven points apiece. 
Chris Fields led the Golden Eagles 
with 18 points — 16 of which were scored in the first half of the game — and five rebounds.
With just 14 minutes left in the sec-
ond half, Lawley sunk two free throws, pulling the Tritons within ten at 38-28. The Eagles responded by pushing their lead to 20 on a three-pointer with eight minutes left on the clock. 
Over the following six minutes, 
the Tritons put together a 10-2 run to reach 45-55. But the late surge was not enough for the Tritons: CSULA held tight for the final two minutes to take the win at 62-53. 
LA shot at 42 percent throughout 
the game, outscoring the Tritons 26-14 on free throws. Though the Eagles also won the battle of the boards — out-rebounding the Tritons 50-24 — UCSD has been the better rebounder among five of six of its last opponents. 
Though the loss was disappointing 
after such a big win, Lawley said he likes what he has seen from his team in the recent weeks.
“Seeing our progress over the past 
few games and practices has made me extremely hopeful for the heart of league play, ” Lawley said. “I look forward to getting ‘W’s in front of our Triton home crowd. ”
The Tritons tried to right their ship 
in CCAA play on a trip to Carson, Calif., where they took on Cal State Dominguez Hills at the Torodome. However, their losing trend continued for a 55-67 fall. The Toros improved to 2-7 overall and 2-2 in CCAA play, while the Tritons fell to 2-6 overall and 1-4 in conference.
The game was knotted up at 39-38 
with 14 minutes left in the second half, at which point Dominguez Hills took the lead and never looked back. 
Lawley, the only Triton to reach 
double figures, sank five of his 13 shots from the field and 11 of 12 from the freethrow line. Christian Hatch added nine points to the cause, while Jake Tarabilda and Dylan Bohanan scored eight points apiece. The Toros out-
scored the Tritons 17-1 on second- chance points, which ultimately proved to be the difference in the game.
The Tritons look to turn their record 
around upon returning home to host Chico State and Cal State Stanislaus in next weekend’s conference games. Before that, UCSD will entertain the Wildcats in its CCAA home opener on Thursday evening at 7:30 p.m.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — After a difficult 0-4 
start to this season, the UCSD men’s basketball picked up its game with two wins over winter break. On Dec. 22, the Tritons took their first league win of the season: a decisive 64-49 vic-tory over San Diego Christian College at RIMAC Arena. However, they were subsequently hum-bled in the new year, falling 52-63 to Cal State Los Angeles on Jan. 2, then again 55-67 to Cal State Dominguez Hills on Jan. 3. UCSD now stands 2-6 overall and 1-4 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play. 
Senior guard Jordan Lawley has anchored the 
Triton offense and tallied 20 points in UCSD’s home opener against San Diego Christian College, connecting on seven of his 14 from the field and five of six from the freethrow line. Sophomore center Christian Hatch lent seven points and seven rebounds, while freshman forward Justin Brue gave the Tritons a much-needed boost once he got off the bench — scoring six points and pulling down 11 rebounds.
UCSD put up a solid defense throughout the 
game, preventing SDCC from sneaking easy bas-kets and forcing them to shoot 31 percent from the field. The Hawks managed only eight field goals and a mere 28 percent of their attempted field goals in the first half. The Tritons took advantage of the Hawks’ slow start by sinking a stellar 40 percent of their shots, or 22 of 55 attempts. 
After SDCC’s first five points, the Tritons went 
on a 12-point tear, taking a seven-point lead with 12 minutes left in the first half. Brue topped off the run with two jumpers, bringing the score to 12-7. The Tritons kept their foot on the pedal, accumulating a 28-13 advantage with less than four minutes left in the half. The team stormed into halftime with a 32-20 lead.
The Tritons started the second half where they 
left off, going on a 14-7 run to reach their greatest lead of the game, at 46-27. Though the Hawks ral-lied back with nine straight points pulling within 10 points of the Tritons — though they were unable to cut into their deficit further, and Lawley sealed the UCSD victory with six straight points.
Brue nailed a jump shot that gave the Tritons 
a 16-point lead, giving way to a a 64-49 victory. 
Despite his team’s 20-point victory, Lawley 
said he felt “The game against SD Christian wasn’t our best performance, but it definitely reassured me that we are taking progressive steps. We did a lot of positive things on the offensive and defensive ends of the court, but I still feel like we need to make our big men more of a presence throughout the game. ”
UCSD hit the road for more conference play 
as they took on Cal State Los Angeles on Jan. 2. Lawley scored 24 points — a team and game 
high — but his personal victory wasn’t enough 
to contain the Golden Eagles, who had won five of their last six games.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — Two wins over the 
weekend placed the 2009-10 women’s basketball team at No. 1 in UCSD’s record books.
Spending their last two days of winter break 
on the road, the Tritons recorded close wins against Cal State Los Angeles and Cal State Dominguez Hills, with a combined two-game victory margin of only nine points. The wins extended the Triton streak to 10 — the first time in university history. 
On Saturday, the Tritons defeated CSULA 
65-61. With only 1:08 remaining in a tied game, sophomore pointguard Chelsea Carlisle capital-ized on an LA turnover and sank a three-pointer, handing UCSD the lead for the rest of the match.
Carlisle and junior forward Tiffany Hunter 
led the team with 15 points a piece, with senior guard Annette Ilg adding 10 points. Despite a poor shooting night, the Tritons held on for the victory: UCSD shot just 38 percent from the field, but made 35 percent from beyond the arc. On the other hand, LA shot over 50 percent from the field and outrebounded the Tritons 40-32, but only took four freethrow shots — compared to 19 from the Tritons.    
The Golden Eagles were led by junior for-
ward Jordan Kuzma, who put in 15 points. Overall, though, fell to 2-7 overall keeping them winless in league play. 
The Tritons continued their streak with a 
69-64 victory over CSU Dominguez Hills on Sunday. Carlisle once again led the way, totaling a 28-point season high — two points short of her career high. Though the Tritons came out slowly, trailing by as many as 11 in the first half and five at halftime, they took advantage of  the Toros’ mistakes to score 20 points off turnovers. Carlisle scored seven of the Tritons’ final nine points, including a go-ahead three-pointer for 6M_AMIZ¼[

With a new year comes new hope for a fresh start. That is, except for the sol-
diers of the gridiron in the National Football League. With Super Bowl XLIV a mere month away, the start of 2010 signals the end for most NFL teams’ runs — with the exception of one very worthy team.
As the playoffs begin, even 
upper-echelon teams need to tighten their game. So, just as any average Joe makes New Y ear’s resolutions at the start of January, I propose the following strategies for NFL teams to kick their bad habits and earn a bid 
at this year’s Super Bowl.
 First on my list are the San 
Diego Chargers, who need to kick 
their procrastination habits. San Diego has had an unnerving habit of not killing off opponents early enough in games, and relying on narrow last-second victories. In a Week One match against the paltry Oakland Raiders, San Diego was lucky to eke past with a touchdown only 18 seconds before the end of the game. In Week Nine, with fewer than 30 seconds on the clock, the Chargers scored the game-winning touchdown to beat the New Y ork Giants by a point, and it took a field goal with only three seconds on the clock to beat the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 14. I could go on forever about the Chargers’ late-game hero-ics, but I’ve got a word count to worry about here. So let’s just say if the Chargers want to pass the ultimate Super Bowl exam, they are going to have to be sharp from the first blow of the whistle to the last. We the students could even learn a thing or two from the Chargers: Waiting until the last second is not worth the risk.
Maybe it’s a combination of the 
jet lag and aging players, but the New England Patriots have had a hard time adapting to away-game environments. Coming into this weekend’s match, the Patriots sport an outstanding 8-0 home record. But, as impressive as they are at home, they are equally disappointing on the road, accumulating a 2-5 record in games outside the Northeast. This season, New England has failed to prove they have what it takes to win abroad — their only road wins came against the lowly Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the mediocre Buffalo Bills. Fortunately for them, they will host one of the Wild Card games. However, should they advance, a road game in the Divisional Round of the 
playoffs against either the Chargers 
or the Indianapolis Colts awaits. The Patriots have to get tougher on the road, or go home for good.
Everyone deserves a chance after 
an honest mistake. But the Green Bay Packers have asked for one too many second chances, and expect automatic forgiveness. Having col-lected a league-leading 114 penal-
ties as the regular season comes to 
a close, the Green Bay Packers are pushing their luck. They also lead the league in another dubious stat they shouldn’t be too proud of: sacks allowed. Heading into this weekend,
