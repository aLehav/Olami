The Associated Students could soon see roughly 
$140,000 in debt accumulated by the Grove Cafe 
reflected on their annual operating budget. Though the Student Affairs Office has absorbed the debt gen-erated by the eatery for the last several years, university officials recently initiated an effort to clear the deficit from their expenses.
According to Student Life Business Director John 
Hughes, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue’s office recently requested that his department identify any long-running deficits within its operating expenses.
Hughes said the debt accrued by the Grove Cafe, as 
well as a similar amount hanging over Cafe Vita — the Graduate Student Association’s own coffee house in east campus — immediately caught his attention.
“When the university examines its budget and 
looks at its negative deficits, things like the Grove Cafe jump off the page, ” Hughes said. 
According to Hughes, Student Life Director of 
Finances Dawn Buttrell asked that he explore ways to remedy the outstanding deficits. Earlier this month, Hughes met with A.S. President Utsav Gupta to dis-cuss transferring the Grove’s debt from the university’s budget to that of the A.S. Council.
Hughes said both the undergraduate council and 
the GSA would be able to absorb the deficits accrued by their coffee shops without difficulty, given the scope of their financial resources.
“ A.S. and GSA are sitting on large reserves, rela-
tively speaking, ” Hughes said. “So the vice chancellor’s office is saying, ‘Why don’t you just move that deficit to your own budget?’”Student Affairs Office looks to cut

turn the fourth slice of “Wedge” lot — 82,000 square feet of open space in Eleanor Roosevelt College — into a sustainable park area.
The site attracted the attention of 
student environmentalists last year when the university proposed to turn the space — located just east of North Torrey Pines Rd. — into a parking lot. Organizations like Greeks Gone KILL

See WEDGE page 7 Students chalked tallies on Ridge Walk last week to demonstrate the impact of the UC Board of Regents’ Nov. 19 fee increase.After a hectic finals week, 
college students can turn from Red Bull and Rockstar to a weekend 
alternative: Energy drinks like Four and Joose are infused with up to 12-percent alcohol, so that reaching the 4 a.m. mark can be a breeze. However, the half-decade old product — a popular and toxic combination — may soon be banned.
The Food and Drug 
Administration requested evi-
dence on Nov. 13 from all compa-nies that produce alcopop energy drinks — which also include 3AM Vodka and Liquid 
Charge — that their products are unharmful to consumers.
The FDA has never deemed 
caffeine safe in any amount when mixed with alcoholic beverages. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, any substance added to food is considered unsafe and unlawful until is has been approved by FDA regulation, and is subject to prior sanction before it can be stamped as Generally Recognized As Safe.
The FDA said in a press 
release that it was unaware of any existing GRAS under which the beverage would be deemed legal. If alcoholic energy-drink drink producers fail to provide evidence of either sanctions, the FDA will deem their beverages illegal and halt all sales.  
However, a task force con-
sisting of 18 attorney generals from states including California and New Y ork — along with the San Francisco city attorney — are encouraging the FDA to inspect the combination further.
“There is a strong emerging 
consensus of scientific opinion 
:03,5*,0:.63+,5By Sarah Smith
Associate News Editorthat the combination of caf-
feine and alcohol … poses a serious public health risk, ” task force members said in a letter to the FDA on Sept. 25.
Members also recognized 
that the drink’s stimulants — which often include taurine, ginsing and guarana in addi-tion to caffeine — can reduce self-awareness of being drunk, which could lead to an increase in driving under the influence, sexual assault and other alco-hol-related crimes.
“Y ou do feel like you’re 
sober when you’ve been drink-ing energy drinks and alcohol — even when you’re drunk, ” Eleanor Roosevelt College sophomore Linda Suh said.
According to the FDA sta-
tistics, U.S. college students tend to combine caffeine and alcohol 26 percent of the times that they choose to drink.

Research conducted by a UCSD 
professor has revealed the presence 
of heart disease in Egyptian mummy remains, disproving the common theory that heart disease is a new occurrence caused by unhealthy modern lifestyles. 
Michael Miyamoto, a doctor at 
the UCSD School of Medicine,  jour-neyed to Cairo, Egypt in February 2009 as part of a team of scientists that analyzed the remains of 22 mummies taken from the Egyptian National Museum of Antiquities. The mummies dated from 1981 B.C. to A.D. 334 and, on average, were age 45 when they died. 
“The mummies were selected 
based on how well preserved they were, carried to trailers around the rear of the museum and then later collected and reviewed [for] infor-mation, ” Miyamoto said. Using computed axial tomogra-
phy scans, the team discovered that 16 of the 22 mummies showed the presence of calcium within the soft tissues deposited in blood vessels. Nine of the 16 had blood vessels containing calcified plaque, which is a indicator of a form of heart disease now known as atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. However, the presence of plaque was not dis-covered within the major coronary arteries such as the aorta. The finding disproved the prior 
notion that heart disease was purely the result of activities such as smok-ing and an unhealthy lifestyle. The discovery of heart disease in ancient remains opens the possibility that humans have a genetic predisposi-tion for heart disease, although Miyamoto said that an unhealthy lifestyle may still have contributed to the atherosclerosis.

The A.S. Council manages a total 
operating budget of over $3.1 mil-
lion each year, the majority of which is derived from a quarterly student activity fee. Additionally, the council possesses a reserve fund of roughly $1 million.
“It’s a pretty logical choice for [the 
university] to ask us to bear the bur-den of our own debt, ” Gupta said. 
The A.S. Council and the GSA 
both operate as university depart-ments. Much of their finances are managed by the university, including payroll for A.S. and GSA staff mem-bers and long-term financial invest-ments, which are carried out by the UC Office of the President.
Their department status also ren-ders all debts accrued by certain A.S. and GSA enterprises the immediate financial responsibility of the univer-sity. Though the Grove Cafe is techni-cally owned and operated by the A.S. Council, the eatery’s sizeable debt is not currently reflected in the council’s budget. Instead, it is reflected in a uni-versity account.
According to Hughes, the univer-
sity is willing to support departmental debts to a certain extent, but these deficits eventually begin to yield nega-tive financial repercussions for the university if they are allowed to grow too large.
This concern arises specifically 
when considering the university’s Short Term Investment Pool — a pro-gram through which UCOP financial managers annually invest departmen-tal revenue from each campus, then transfer two percent of any returns back to the departments. When the university carries deficits — such as those of the Grove Cafe and Cafe Vita — they reflect negatively on depart-mental STIP returns. 
According to Hughes, by main-
taining a Grove deficit on its budget, the Student Affairs Office loses rough-ly $2,800 each year in STIP funds. Though the figure is relatively small in comparison to the university’s total operating budget, Hughes said clear-ing the budget of deficits is simply good bookkeeping. 
Gupta said he believes the uni-

I’ve never considered myself the 
cooking type. Before picking up this column gig, tossing around 
a pigskin was the closest I’ d come to handling cured meat. 
But making a meal from scratch 
for a hot date still seemed an appro-priate gesture from the sort of accom-plished young man I pretend to be (you know, the kind of guy you take to a family dinner, and that your grandma can hug). With visions of being that pseudo-sophisticated boy-friend, I pulled on my argyle sweater and hopped online to peruse a selec-tion of romantic recipes. 
Who, you ask, was the intended 
recipient of my culinary spoils? We’ll call her Paula — a girl I was introduced to through a high-school friend. OK, so it was a blind date. Luckily, she passed the initial Facebook screening. From what I learned from our mutual friend and her profile, she had just returned from a semester of teaching English in Peru — meaning, of course, that she was a cosmopolitan lady with a cultured palate. 
Now, to impress her with my 
feigned mastery of world cuisine. In order to accommodate my fledgling abilities in the kitchen, the dish need-ed to be complex in taste yet simple in preparation. With the given criteria, I decided to make aji de gallina — a 
dish Paula must have known well after her time in Peru. Aji de gallina, simply 
put, is chicken in a cream sauce. Its basic ingredients are skinless chicken breast, coarsely chopped onion, chopped carrots, garlic cloves, white bread, Parmesan cheese, walnuts, ground turmeric, eggs, milk and the requisite aji amarillo  chili paste. List in 
hand, I headed down to Whole Foods Market (nothing says “cultured young 
gentleman” like over-priced free-range chicken) to gather the ingredients for my swoon-worthy entree. 
 Three hours 
before Paula’s anticipated arrival, I started in on the aji 
de gallina . First, I placed the chicken, 
onions, carrots and garlic in a large saucepan and brought them to a simmer with a bit of water. Once it began to really crackle, I skimmed the foam off the top, reduced the heat, covered the pan and let the chicken continue to simmer until tender. Then I removed the chicken from the pan 
and let it cool on a plate. 
I strained the chicken stock, 
removed the vegetables and put them 
in a blender with cubed pieces of white bread and milk. 
After blending until smooth, I 
added the walnuts and Parmesan cheese and again pureed in a cream. 
Once the chicken cooled, I shred-
ded it and discarded the bones. (After 
it’s boiled, chicken shreds pretty eas-
ily — even for me). Then I heated the vegetables in a separate saucepan, adding minced garlic and onions. I stirred until the garlic appeared trans-*TIUM1\WV\PM2WW[MKIM CYPRIAN /GUARDIAN
See KITCHEN page 5NATIONAL NEWS —  Last week, the Food and 
Drug Administration sent a group of alcoholic-energy-drink producers a hostile warning: either prove their efficient beverages harmless within 30 days or face product discontinuation. 
But before the FDA adopts such a righteous 
approach to the caffeine-plus-alcohol buzz, it should consider the craftiness of the product’s No. 1 fans.
Not to mention the logical sore thumb in this 
situation: If the FDA were to ask all the alcoholic beverage and tobacco companies in the country for proof that their products were harmless, we’ d be facing Prohibition: Part Two in 30 days flat.Then there’s the fact that mixing depressants 
like alcohol with stimulants like caffeine isn’t a novel concept. We’ve been Irishing up our coffee far too long for the FDA to label the alco-holic energy drink a concerning new craze.
The FDA wants to eliminate fizzy fruit-
flavored beverages like Joose — which contains about 4 percent more alcohol than your aver-age Budweiser — for two reasons: They make people feel less impaired than they actually are, and those people are usually young. And, though this might be a farfetched assumption, it’s likely FDA officials don’t think young people can handle their shit. For the most part, the FDA ’s right; young 
people are serious drinkers. According to a 2008 study from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, adults aged 18 to 24 are the most likely to participate in “high risk” drinking — something you could have inferred yourself after a highly vomitous freshman year.
 And it seems like any beverage that tastes 
like grape soda has a pretty sweet Von-Dutch rip-off aesthetic and — most importantly — will get you twice as drunk as Bud Light must be stopped, for the sake of the children. Except 
Uninvited to the Obamas’ first State Dinner, crafty couple Tareq and Michaele Salahis squeezed past security in hopes of achieving quick reality-star fame. 
After lucking their way through Secret Service security measures, the “Real Housewives” hopefuls hilariously rubbed elbows with  most prominent political 
figures in the country — including Barack and Michelle themselves. But can we just dismiss this trespass as a harmless publicity stunt?   
The Salahis’ tacky breach of White 
House security is certainly cause for 
alarm. But in this particular case, we can only roll our eyes at the amount of media attention being projected onto another fame-starved housewife, and move on. 
Consider who is truly culpable in the 
situation — one single, blundering, missing security guard holding the event’s official guest list. He wasn’t there to differentiate between the chest-hugging cocktail dress of the particular cougar who was actually welcome at the event and Michaele Salahi’s slinky red sari. So why not just fire the lackey and get on with our lives?
Whether or not the media continues 
to squeeze the life out of Security-Breach 
Barbie, it’s guaranteed the Secret Service 
won’t be letting any more trespassers breeze past the White House gates. So, let’s forget the security goof and get back to the world of real problems being relegated to page two.
— Kelsey Marrujo
Senior Staff WriterLast Tuesday’s average-Joe White House intrusion may have pointed out potential 
for disaster, but it boils down to little more than a harmless and lighthearted publicity stunt. 
By muscling their way into a state dinner, 
Michaele and Tareq Salahi were only taking 
desperate measures to earn their 15 minutes 
of fame — and to shop their story out to the highest bidder (to the ludicrous tune of $500,000).
In the words of the couple’s own attorney, 
Paul Morrison: “They just went to a party. They didn’t do anything wrong. ”
Though Morrison’s judgment is question-
able (the U.S. Constitution may not explic-itly forbid party-crashing, but in this case, 
it’s kind of a no-brainer), the Salahi couple 
had no extremist political agenda to fulfill — only a prized spot on the Bravo network’s “Real Housewives of DC. ”That just makes them cooler than you.
— Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion EditorIt’s tempting to dismiss the Salahi case as two forgettable limelight-seekers striving to 
fit the deranged reality-star mold — but if a pair of airheads could pull it off, imagine what someone could do with a real plan of attack.  
Even though the couple’s sneaky entry into 
the White House could be blamed on simple 
human error (even with stealthy headsets, 
Secret Service agents are, after all, still just people), when it comes the safety of the rulers of the free world, there’s no room for mistakes. 
As the first African American president 
in U.S. history, President Barack Obama faces massive danger — in fact, according to CNN, since he took office, presidential death threats have risen 400 percent. It may not have been a crime for the Salahis to strut their way into the 
Oval Office, but it’s inexcusable that anyone 
fortunate enough not to be halted by a guest-listing doorman could get through the rest of security without so much as a “Have a nice evening. ”

PART 3 It was Spring Break at Daytona 
Beach.  I was lying on the beach, enjoying the 
sun’s rays and a happy buzz from some brew.  I 
was 20 years old, a junior at Davidson College in 
North Carolina.  A song by “The Turtles” came on the 
radio, and I laughed with joy as they crooned their tune:  “So 
happy together, how is the weather…”.  For some reason those words struck me funny.  “So happy together”, seemingly sincere words to one genuinely cared about.  Then, “how is the weather?”, which sounds so trite and shallow.  I laughed because the two swings, from apparent sincerity and depth to superficiality and triviality, typified my life.  I was living life like it was an absurd silly game, drinking and partying, living the wild l i f e ,  n o  p u r p o s e ,  n o  g o a l s .   I  w a s n ’ t  a  W i l d  L i f e  m a j o r  academically, but certainly was socially.  Suddenly, as I listened to the music, my mood changed dramatically, from contentedness with the meaninglessness of my life, to alarm about the same.  It was an awakening of sorts that set me on a quest.  I made a decision that day on the beach: “There must be a meaning to life, and I intend to find it.”  
The words of Jesus came to my mind, “I am the Light of the 
world.  Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John 8:12 NIV).  Those words greatly intrigued me.  Was Jesus crazy, delusional?  Was He a legend created by overzealous followers?  Or was He God in flesh, Truth incarnate, grounded in a Truth I had never experienced before?  Back at college, I signed up for a course the next semester entitled, The Life and Ministry of Jesus, taught by an agnostic.  As I read the books and the gospels, I became utterly amazed at the Person of Jesus.  Although at that time I did not believe in the reported miracles or in His resurrection from the dead, still I was drawn to Him as the most intriguing and amazing person I had ever known about.  His power, His authority – never used for His own benefit; His love and identification with the least, the last, the lost, the lonely, the “losers”;  His authenticity, genuineness, confidence in who He was and what His life was about; His teachings, His heart, His passion.  The more I read, the more excited I became.  “Jesus is amazing…Jesus is AMAZING!!!”   I became obsessed, in a positive and exciting sense, in my quest to learn all I could about Him.  I felt like a man in the desert, looking for water –and I could see what looked like a wonderful oasis.  But could it be a mirage?  I had to know – “Is Jesus Christ a mirage, or is He the REAL THING?  
It was three days into Christmas break my senior year at college.  
I had stayed over to work on a paper about Jesus.  I remember reading something like this in one book: “Jesus wasn’t saying to believe this creed or that set of ethics.  He was saying, ‘Give me your life!  Follow me, Either – Or, Yes or No, paint or get off the ladder!’”   My heart responded and I poured out all my pent up feelings and thoughts.  “Yes! Yes, Jesus – I want to follow You, I 
want to be like You.  You are my Hero…  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!”   At that 
point an amazing thing happened, something that completely changed my life.  A veil in the spiritual realm was lifted, and God’s love powerfully engulfed me.  I felt an incredible sense that I was known and cared for by an infinite, personal Spiritual Being.  “God is!  Life matters!  It has meaning!  There is a purpose for my life!”  I wept on and off for days.  Jesus revealed Himself to me, personally -- to my heart, my mind, and my spirit.
I believe that if God did that for me, He will do that for you.  If 
He loves me, He loves you.  If He created me and has a purpose for my life, He created you and has a purpose for your life.  Some believe we can create our own reality, at least in the spiritual 
realm, and that all our ideas and beliefs are equally valid.  But 
God either exists or He doesn’t, regardless of what you or I 
believe about it.  Let me close with a question to you:  If God exists, and if He reveals Himself to you in a way that is unmistakable to you, are you willing to accept Him?  If Jesus Christ is God incarnate, the hope of the world, do you want to know it and will you follow Him? 

Dear Editor,
I am writ
ing in response to the 
inclusion of the “Best Mini Coffee” in 
the Guardian’s Nov. 19 issue. In full 
disclosure, I am a columnist for San Diego CityBeat , which just ran its own 
“Best of ” issue, and  I’m also married 
to one of the owners of the Art of Espresso. 
I find it perplexing that you chose 
to include a biting, juvenile review of the Art of Espresso under the “Best of ” stamp. Hello, editors? Did you take the day off when Chris Kokiousis turned in his work? The author clearly thinks he was being edgy and smart in his commentary, but he really only served to up his own “douche factor” with his backbiting blurb. 
Perhaps he was aiming to diss 
the Art of Espresso, but instead he insulted Art of Espresso customers  
— the faculty, staff and student 
“assholes” who frequent it — simply 
for carrying an eight-ounce “I’m a dick” cup of coffee. (Incidentally, 
eight ounces is the proper size of a traditional cappuccino.) I can only assume you went to press before the announcement that student “assholes” 
will be paying 32 percent more for 
tuition next year. But your writer had to have been aware that the “assholes” comprising the faculty and staff have been hit in the pocketbook by furloughs. Not everyone on campus has the financial ability to purchase expensive coffee drinks, and the Art of Espresso recognizes this. They go to great lengths to keep costs low without compromising quality or service; certainly, you won’t find the honor-system basket on every counter in the city. 
People buy their coffee — mini or 
otherwise — at the Art of Espresso  not because they want to offer a “midget middle finger to conformity” (though that sure is a cute bit of writing trickery). They go there because the product is good and 
consistent, the service is personable 
and the prices are low. Those are the 
qualities that should be enumerated in a “Best of ” issue.

)Z\WN-[XZM[[Wlucent, then added the chicken and 
aji amarillo  until the dish heated 
through. Finally, I threw in the bread puree and cooked it until hot, sea-soning with turmeric along the way. 
The divine taste of a 
dish, of course, is only a minor detail when it comes to blind-date strategy. Both my personal presentation — and also the dish’s — were of utmost importance. I placed the burnt-orange aji de gallina in a matching bowl and served it next to some rice and hard-boiled egg. 
As for myself, I settled 
on a striped brown-and-orange sweater over pressed khakis, complementing the colors of the main dish without creating the illusion that my outfit was inspired by a creamy chicken breast. 
Smooth.One heavy knock later, 
Paula had arrived with a bottle of wine. Unfortunately — despite her best efforts — the wine, dinner and my awesome sweater were the only consolations of the night. I thought that preparing a Peruvian dish would be a nice ice-breaker in 
a typically awkward situ-ation. However, the dish selection only served to remind her of her first time trying aji de gallina, when 
she began a fling with a strapping young lad called Paolo — who, by the end of the night, I came to know far too much about. (Turns out he gave her the real authentic  South American 
experience.) 
Now, thanks to Paula 
(and Paolo), I at least know it’s best to hold off on the dinner-at-home invite until the third or fourth date, after you’ve confirmed that there’s at least some sem-blance of chemistry at each end of the dinner table. 
As for my next blind 
date, Domino’s and a 12-pack of PBR should do the trick. A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro
that banning alcoholic energy drinks overlooks one detail: There’s still noth-ing to stop us wily college kids — or any old bartender, for that matter — from mixing Red Bull with Smirnoff and calling it a night.
One of youth’s favorite activities is 
breaking petty laws — downloading trilogies, stealing eye drops, smoking the reefer, speeding, owning ferrets — you name it. So what’ s to stop us from brewing our own Four Loko-inspired, modern day moonshine? We’re just a hop, skip and a Rockstar away from rocket-charged jungle juice.
Banning alcoholic energy drinks 
because they’re marketed to young people follows the same logic as eliminating Victoria Secret’s Pink line because it encourages underage girls to have sex. It assumes the worst about the product without placing responsibility in the hands of the sin-ner. 
If FDA officials respected every-
one’s god-given right to make poor health choices — not just crusty, whis-key-sipping chain smokers’ — they’ d get out the party and stop threatening to dry up our Joose supply.
But since they’ve already sent 
out an official warning, the FDA should at least do something use-ful with its power. Why not slap a Surgeon General’s warning on every can, warning against the effects of combining alcohol and caffeine (and add a fat sales tax to boot). A higher price might encourage some Four fans to settle for Natural Light, and the money collected from all those already hooked on alcoholic energy drinks could go toward youth-targeted drunk-driving prevention programs like Every 15 Minutes. Or hey, maybe all that drunk pocket change could save the future of the University of California. Anything would be better than sweeping the whole mess under the rug with all those other forbidden things we still use.
Also, avoiding a complete ban of 
the beverage would allow the FDA to influence ingredients and alcoholic content — regulations that would fall to the wayside once students mix their own shoddy home-brews.
It’s about time our government got 
realistic about all the sinful tempta-
tions in this world. Kids have sex. 
They smoke pot. And they drink Joose. It’s all a matter of guiding — not forcing — us to practice healthy behavior. And even if educating our generation seems like a lost cause, at the very least they could save up to impart some wisdom on the next one.

versity is moving to shore up its 
expenses due to the systemwide budget crisis.
“The university overall is wor-
ried about debt accruing against their accounts, especially when they’re looking at extensive budget cuts going into the future, ” Gupta said. “They’re trying to save any amount of money they can, any-where; $3,000 may not seem like a lot to us, but to them it could be enough to save a particular pro-gram. ”
Gupta said he expects the uni-
versity to pursue other similar debt-reduction efforts in the near future.
“There are actual academic 
departments that are in debt to the university, ” Gupta said. “It will be 
interesting to see how the univer-
sity starts moving forward on all of these debts. When the budget gets cut, you start looking at where your negatives are. They’re going to be going after places where there is debt, wherever it may lie. It’s more a fiscal calculation than anything else. ”

Quietocean view studyPg. 15“Unhealthy lifestyle may have 
been an indicator of the heart disease 
since people who could afford to be mummified typically had high socio-economic status, ” Miyamoto said. “They were people who worked in the courts, priests [and] other high places and they likely had a much more calorie-rich diet which included salt and meat. ” 
Despite the relatively small 
sample size, heart disease was not uncommon. The presence of atherosclerosis was detected in both sexes within the designated age range. Miyamoto said it was difficult to estimate the level of atherosclerosis in relation to mod-ern humans since the levels varied widely, but that the basic vascular appearance was very similar. 
Miyamoto stressed that although 
genetic predisposition may be a fac-tor contributing to heart disease, the discovery does not give people license to ignore the positive effects created by a healthy lifestyle. 
“It’s very important for doctors 
to take this information and say that yes, we may be predestined, but environment is equally powerful and we need to make positive changes to ensure our health, ” Miyamoto said. 
He emphasized the importance of 
lifestyle changes — such as quitting smoking and eating a low-fat diet — in fighting heart disease. 
“We don’t want people to look 
at this discoery and have a fatalistic attitude, ” he said. “In fact, we want it to be the opposite: tell patients that have these dispositions [that] we have to concentrate on what we can do to optimize lifestyle choices to extend life. We can still change our risk of heart disease. ”
The team members plan to 
return to Cairo later this year in order to study mummies from lower socioeconomic classes to determine 
if hardening of the arteries is present in that demographic as well, as well as to discover if it is present in coro-nary arteries.

COURTESEY  OF MICHAEL  MIYAMOTO  
Computed axial tomography was used to scan the 22 Egyptain mummies to detect signs of atherosclerosis, 
or hardening of the arteries, in heart tissue. Sixteen of the 22 mummies showed signs of heart disease.
Green and the Compost Team peti-
tioned the A.S. Council, arguing that the Wedge should fulfill its original purpose of becoming a sustainable space. Their actions drew the attention of Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, who supported the project as well.
UCSD Physical Planning specialists 
first envisioned the Wedge in 1994 as consisting of four “phases” of construc-tion in ERC between Ridge Walk and North Torrey Pines Rd. Phases I and II — which covered ERC’s main stairs and the winding path north of Cafe Ventanas — were realized in 2003, while Phase III was completed in 2007.
However, the university lacked 
financial support for the space between 
the Village and ERC, and construction 
remained idle until student protests drew attention to the area.
“Student groups paid attention 
and got people to notice, ” Todd Pitman, senior planner for UCSD Physical Planning and chair of the Open Space Committee, said. “Chancellor Fox then decided that construction should begin as well. ” 
According to Pitman, the long-term 
goals for the area include creating a functional space with solar capabilities, natural seating and pedestrian walk-ways. Additionally, runoff water from other parts of campus will be reclaimed to irrigate the area’s landscaping.“This project is good for the pub-
lic’s perception of UCSD, ” Pitman said. “We would be showing that we practice what we preach by having a sustainable area. ”
The university still lacks the fund-
ing for all these goals to be met, but Assistant Vice Chancellor of Physical and Community Planning Brian D. Gregory said there is enough to con-vert the existing parking lot into a sustainable area. 
“We don’t have the money to do 
the complete project, which would cost over $2 million, and it is going to take time to get additional money, ” Gregory said.
The first part of “Wedge Phase IV” 
consists of ripping out the asphalt, planting native coastal foliage and lay-ing down pathways and infrastruc-ture for future projects. According to Gregory, around $500,000 of the $900,000 bill will come from Housing and Dining Services, while the rest will be drawn from campuswide funds dis-tributed at the chancellor’s discretion. 
Turner Construction Company 
began the project in October, and landscape architects Spurlock Poirier worked with the Physical Planning Office to plan Phase IV .  Construction is set for completion by January 2010.

mram@ucsd.edu.Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-more Danielle Jenné said. “It’s inef-fective to try to stop something that’s going to happen anyway. The govern-ment needs to mind its own business. ”
Twenty-seven drink manufac-
turers — including United Brands Company, Inc. and the P .I.N.K. Spirits Company/Prohibition Beverage Inc. — have been given 30 days to comply with the FDA ’s request. They must supply evidence that their products are previously sanctioned or GRAS — or they will be outlawed.
Suh said she is unsure a ban on 
alcoholic energy drinks would dis-courage college students from con-suming a mix of alcohol and caffeine — even if they are not packaged and sold together.
“People mix alcohol and Red Bull 
at parties all the time, ” Suh said. “ A ban on alcoholic energy drinks won’t change that. It’s just a waste of time. ”
Revelle College sophomore 
Nancy Carmona agreed that ban-ning alcoholic energy drinks should not ease the fears of the FDA or the task force.
“Instead of completely banning 
the drinks, the government needs to spread awareness of the effects of mixing those two substances, ” Carmona said. “That way, people can be responsible for their actions, since 
they’re going to be mixing the two anyway. ”
The FDA expressed that if caf-
feinated alcohol drinks are still deemed unsafe within a month, manufacturers will most likely be forced to halt production.
Anheuser-Busch Co. and 
MillerCoors, the nation’s two largest brewers, halted the sale of alcoholic energy drinks last year due to the New Y ork Attorney General’s concerns that the drink’s health effects were being misrepresented, and that it was being marketed to underage drinkers.

*n the early 1990s, a small population of seals wrig-
gled up to a short stretch of prime La Jolla Cove real 
estate and declared it home. Only problem was, the protected shore was originally created in 1931 as a safe swimming spot for young children. Once the 
seals moved in, local residents began what would be a decade-plus fight over the beach’s rightful inhabitants.
As much of the threat of a Chargers relocation, the La 
Jolla children-versus-seals showdown is a long-drawn-out news item in San Diego. But — as of a Nov. 13 ruling by Superior Court Judge Timothy B. Taylor — it seems the debate over the Children’s Pool can finally be put to rest. Taylor’s ruling: The seals are here to stay. 
The army of local residents fighting to drive the seals 
from the Children’s Pool have long argued that the cove has become a tanning bed to the growing colony of sea mammals who contaminate the water and prevent humans from utiliz-ing the site. When Valerie O’Sullivan received a ticket for dis-turbing the seals while swimming in the cove in 2004, it was just what nay sayers needed to ignite the fight. O’Sullivan’s citation was evidence of the seals’ increasing rights to the beach — rights to which the community had never agreed. 
Soon after receiving the ticket, O’Sullivan brought the 
city to court, citing its failure to maintain the beach in accordance with the trust that founded it in 1931. This trust, established by late philanthropist and La Jolla resident Ellen Browning Scripps (who also founded the Scripps Institute of Oceanography upon which UCSD was built), originally stated that the cove should be “devoted exclusively to public park, bathing pool for children. ” 
Scripps commissioned the construction of a 300-foot 
sea wall that now curves around the small beach, protecting it from large waves and undercurrents that could endanger young swimmers. The site was dubbed the La Jolla Children’s Pool, and became a hub for families looking for a stress-free day at the beach. 
But, by allowing the seals to take over the beach and 
prevent its use as a “bathing pool, ” the city of San Diego had failed to uphold Scripps’ land deed.
In 2005, one year after O’Sullivan filed suit, Judge William 
Pate ruled that the seals’ presence and resulting water con-tamination was indeed counter to Scripps’ trust. Pate ordered that the city disperse the seals and clean the beach for human use by dredging it, an intensive excavation that would restore both the shore and immediate underwater area.
What followed was a series of contradictory back-
and-forth court decisions spanning the five years since O’Sullivan’s suit, building off the anger of two passionate teams —animal-rights activists on the pro-seals front and La Jolla residents on the other — who had been volleying argu-
ments since tensions rose in the mid ’90s. 
The anti-seals cam-
paigners, who spawned the “Friends of the Children’s 
Pool” Web site www.friend-
softhechildrenspool.com  have 
a growing list of complaints 
against the seals. As the seal population has increased, access to the beach’s ideal swimming area has steadily declined. And even if one can find a swimming spot, 
it’s usually contaminated with 
seal feces.
“It sucks having to swim 
though [the Children’s Pool] to go catch a wave or go fishing, ” Sixth College senior Michael Barrus said.
 Joining the La Jolla residents in the seal resistance were 
local fisherman, who said fish populations were decreasing due to the booming seal population. 
But the pro-seal side — who have their own “La Jolla 
Friends of the Seals” Web site www.lajollafriendsoftheseals.
org — argue that the seal population isn’t growing at all. The 
“Friends” site presents studies that estimate the seal popula-tion at a stable 200, with no notable increase over the past five years. 
Seal supporters also turn to the heart-wrenching argu-
ment that — despite its original intent — the Children’s Pool has become a necessary sanctuary for animals living in a harsh new ocean.
“This is one of the last places for seals to give birth on 
the California coastline, ” Friends of the Seals volunteer Emily Field said. “If people are walking on the beach dur-ing pupping season, it scares the seals back into the water, making birthing almost impossible. ”
Fortunately for Field and her fellow seal advocates, 
Taylor’s Nov. 13 decision has lifted a final protective bub-ble over the sea-mammal sanctuary in UCSD’s backyard.
Though the decision overturned Pate’s 2005 ruling 
that the seals be forcefully dispersed, the city of San Diego expressed that it could not have afforded the hefty price tag to dredge the beach anyway. 
This prompted San Diego-district Sen. Christine Keho 
(D-Calif) to introduce legislation in 2007 that would grant the city of San Diego discretion over the cove regardless of Scripps’ trust. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill, and the Nov. 13 hearing to determine the fate of the seals was scheduled. It was at this hearing that Taylor ruled in favor of amending the Scripps trust, allowing the seals to remain.
According to Taylor, his decision to let the seals stay 
was out of simple “respect for the legislative and executive branches of government. ”
But for Field and her fellow pro-sealers, the verdict is, 
above all, a victory for animal rights.
“If we have the ability to restore a small piece of habitat, 
we owe it to the animals to do it, ” said Field.

INFOCUS ON-CAMPUS BICYCLE PARKING
Maybe it’s the inflated La Jolla gas 
prices. Or perhaps it’s the fact that it takes a hopeless half-
hour to score a spot at Hopkins parking structure. Either way, one thing’s clear: Bicycles are booming. 
But with popularity comes problems. 
The number of bike thefts on campus has risen in over the past year, and bike-related accidents are more frequent due to sheer number. But besides theft and bloody Library Walk collisions, bikers have also (ironically) had issues with parking. According to UCSD bicycle enforcement officer Ian Happle, parking is one of the more common, everyday obstacles that the eco-friendly alternative presents.
UCSD bicycle enforcement officers 
will impound any bicycles obstructing handicap ramps, fire exits or campus artwork. Bikes with flat tires, excessive dust or missing parts are usually tacked with a warning notice because their details indicate abandonment — and if these bikes aren’t fixed or relocated soon enough, they’ll soon be whisked away as 
well. 
But at least your old friend will be 
going to a good cause. Impounded bikes 
are currently donated to the Donovan State Correctional facility in southeast San Diego, where inmates refurbish the bikes to send to children and nonprofit organizations. Bikes that can’t be fixed — no matter how many inmates grease their parts — are stored for the UCSD 
engineering department’s annual Junkyard 
Derby in May.

SITESEEN
To most San 
Diegans, the neon Korean 
characters hang-ing above J Music Studio are a testa-ment to the mod-est charm inside. If it weren’t for the supplemental “Music Studios” afterthought, it’s doubtful anyone would even stop to peak inside.
But allow me 
to show you the light: J Music Studio is a dia-mond among all those mysterious Convoy St. gems, existing for what seems to be a sole purpose of letting patrons get sloppy drunk and sing like they were in the privacy of their own shower.
Upon entering the 
long-time San Diego establishment, karaoke hopefuls are offered a modest greeting: a small, cramped foyer, undecorat-ed walls and a simple front counter manned by a tiny old Asian lady who speaks very little English. After a few moments of awkward communication, she will lead you down a hallway to a small, glass-encased room; all the while ignoring the indiscrete brown bags you and your friends are juggling. Once she’s closed the door, the boozing and belting can begin.
Unlike American romantic-comedy karaoke bars, where sing-
ing is often reserved for one brave volunteer on a center stage, J Music Studio styles its establishment on authentic Asian karaoke lounges. For an hourly rate, customers can rent out a private room stocked with a microphone, television, song menu, wrap-around couch and glamorous disco ball — fitting anywhere from four to 15, depending on if you’re going for intimate get-together or sweaty nightclub.
J Music Studio is intent on maintaining your privacy throughout 
the night — even when you’ve spilled so much beer your socks get soggy (to the tune of your favorite Journey ballad, of course).
This karaoke paradise is conveniently located amid several 
other indie Asian delights (read: Y ogurt World, Tapioca Express, Tofu House), so you can enjoy dinner and drinks before you embark on your personalized musical journey — complete with a visual montage of ’90s-era Koreans interacting with nature behind lyrical prompts.

Senior Staff Writer
You may have seen him during UCSD’s first-day walkout or even leading discussions at various teach-ins since — probably in his 
signature short-sleeved button-up (variation of plaid, untucked) and jeans (always a faded blue). Despite his soft-spoken and level-tempered demeanor, professor Jorge Mariscal is a tenacious voice for social justice at the university.
The various causes to which Mariscal dedi-
cates himself — battling the UC budget cuts, promoting campus diversity and countering militarism in high school, to name a few — have roots in a personal experience.
Although the university’s financial quagmire 
is a recent flare-up, Mariscal has always been concerned with the future of public higher education in the Golden State. Raised in Long Beach, the literature professor and first-genera-tion college graduate is himself a product of the state’s three-tiered system: He transferred from a California community college to Cal State Long Beach, and eventually received a Ph.D in Spanish literature and culture from UC Irvine. 
After a couple out-of-state teaching stints, 
Mariscal joined UCSD’s literature department in 1986, where he currently teaches courses in Spanish and Chicano literature, as well as install-ments of Marshall College’s core Dimensions of Culture writing program. 
With 23 years of UC teaching under his belt, Mariscal has emerged as a key fixture in cam-puswide events and discussions about the effects of the UC budget cuts.
“The budget crisis is a tragedy, ” said Mariscal. 
“It’s the result of 30 years of poor government, and it’s hard to reverse. The university is making excuses and trying to get out by putting the cost on students — but the leadership should be find-ing other solutions. ”
He said that the Nov. 17 protests at UCLA 
against the regents’ student-fee hikes were a symbol of the UC students’ passion for their education — a cause to which he promised to contribute.
“I’ll continue working against budget cuts, 
and I’ll be watchful of changes in admissions, ” said Mariscal. “My ultimate goal is for the campus to change to represent the diversity of California as California changes. ”
This kind of diversity has long been a focus 
for Mariscal. 
“For 20 years, I’ve tried to make the campus 
more democratic, ” he said. 
In 1995, Mariscal was chair of the board that 
created the Cross-Cultural Center, a space built to foster diversity and tolerance on campus. And, as a current faculty equity advisor for the Division of Arts and Humanities, he still provides consultation within the teaching staff on new possibilities to diversify UCSD’s student body.
Mariscal cited low admission rates (relative 
to other ethnic groups) as the reason the Latino community is not well represented by UCSD. Because of this, he has focused his efforts on educational issues (such as high tuition fees and high school military recruiting) that keep students from pursuing higher education.
Currently, Mariscal 
is active in Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana y Chicano de Aztlan — a student organization which fights for equal access in higher education.
Mariscal’s most recent M.E.Ch.A. project 
was a new hanging mural at Peterson Hall: The professor approached prominent Chicano art-ist Mario Torero to paint the piece. Originally slated for removal at the end of Fall Quarter, the mural has received enough petition signatures to ensure it a home in Marshall College — at least until June 2012. While M.E.Ch.A students col-lected signatures, Mariscal sought the approval of administrators.
On the academic side of things, Mariscal said 
his courses often focus on the history of social movements in the United States, which he hopes students will connect to their own experiences — something he certainly does in his own life.
Like many members of his generation, 
Mariscal began his political streak in the Vietnam

Antelopes, UCSD started tightening 
the reins early on in the second half. Sophomore center Lauren Freidenberg notched a layup at the 15:22 mark, igniting the Tritons to an 11-2 run over the next five minutes. 
A foul by Grand Canyon center 
Katie Johnson enabled junior center Charity Smith to sink a pair of free 
throws for UCSD and tie the game 
at 50. 
“We didn’t make any specific 
changes [on offense or defense] except 
tell them that we were getting out-hustled and outworked in the first half, ” Elliott said. “I thought we dialed up our intensity, particularly on the defensive end. ”
Over the next two minutes, the 
score ping-ponged back and forth 
between the teams until five straight 
points from Carlisle boosted UCSD’s lead to 61-55 at the 6:08 mark. Senior guard Leilani Martin then scored a layup with 4:34 remaining — offering the Tritons their largest advantage of the game at 66-59. 
Grand Canyon pulled within two  points with 2:31 left, but Friedenberg came up with a crucial offensive rebound, scoring a layup to extend the Triton lead to four. Again, a pair of free throws from Antelope Ashley Hardin made it a two-point game. With 1:57 left on the clock, Ilg drew a foul, hit-ting one of two free throws to give the Tritons a three-point advantage. 
With the game on the line, the 
Antelopes sunk two free throws, tak-ing the game 71-70 and keeping it a nail-biter until the final seconds. 
After a jumper from Carlisle 
missed its mark, Grand Canyon had 
one final chance to claim the win — 
but Antelope forward Stacy Haddow missed her three-point attempt, allow-ing UCSD to seize a rousing victory in its season opener. 
Four players reached double fig-
ures on the Triton side. Carlisle led all scorers with 20 points, adding five assists, five steals and three rebounds. Hunter was superb in her first game 
for UCSD shooting five of eight from 
the field for 12 points. Ilg tallied 12 and finished with four steals, while Freidenberg contributed 10 points and hauled in seven boards. 
“We have depth and players 
from all realms, ” senior forward Erin Noonan said. “We have girls that are amazing shooters, girls who hustle after every ball, girls who are great rebounders and girls that have amaz-
ing defense. ”
The Tritons now look to their first 
CCAA matchup against Cal State San Bernardino on Dec. 4 at Coussoulis Arena. The Coyotes were the only team to defeat UCSD in conference play last season, taking a 62-57 victory on March 3.
“This is a huge weekend com-
ing up, ” Elliott said. “Not only is San Bernardino our second game, but it’s 
also our conference opener — so cer-
tainly, it takes on a whole other level of importance. I know we’ve used these last 10 days to sharpen up on some things that we didn’t do real well. We’re looking to come out from the beginning with a tremendous sense of urgency. ”

By Joe Tevelowitz &

MEN’S BASKETBALL —  Following a 
tough loss to Division-I neighbor San Diego State, the UCSD men’s basket-ball team traveled to the Al Kaly Shrine Classic in Pueblo, Colo., on Nov. 20, hoping to open their regular-season schedule with a win. Despite a strong effort, the Tritons dropped both  tour-nament games, falling 71-63 in over-time against Western State College on Nov. 20 before dropping a 61-43 deci-sion to host Colorado State University-Pueblo the following day. 
UCSD (0-2) will now prepare for 
the start of their California Collegiate Athletic Association tour: an away game at Cal State San Bernardino on Dec. 4.
A slow start by the Tritons was 
the difference in the game against CSU-Pueblo. The ThunderWolves outscored UCSD 11-0 during a key eight-minute stretch in the first half of the game. However, the Tritons shot only 21 percent from the field in the first half — hitting just 4-19 shot attempts — their defense was able to hold the ThunderWolves to 36.4 percent shooting and 0 for 11 from the three-point range before halftime. But CSU-Pueblo managed to build a 14-point lead at the break — thanks in large part to 12 first-half steals. 
Junior guard Casey Ryan scored 12 
points and hauled in a game-high 11 rebounds, but his effort wasn’t enough — UCSD could not climb within nine points of the ThunderWolves in the second half.
“We just kind of ran out of gas, ” 
Carlson said. “Their pressure really bothered us. We expended a lot of energy trying to get back into the game. ” 
CSU-Pueblo’s Daniel Pierce scored 
a game-high 19 points to lead the host team to victory. Freshman guard Dylan Bohanan provided a bright streak for the Tritons, scoring seven points with four rebounds within 15 minutes off the bench. 
CSU-Pueblo shot at a 45-percent 
clip in the second half. The Tritons, on the other hand, finished shoot-ing under 32 percent for the game and recorded only three assists. The ThunderWolves finished the game with 17 steals and outscored the Tritons 25-9 on points off turnovers.
The loss to CSU-Pueblo came on 
the heels of the Tritons’ tournament-opening defeat to Western State the previous night. They allowed a late lead to slip away to the Mountaineers  — despite a solid showing from senior guard Jordan Lawley, who turned in a team-high 21 points and four assists, along with nine rebounds.
UCSD’s first victory of the year 
seemed to appear on the horizon after Lawley’s three-pointer gave the Tritons a 53-41 lead with 7:04 left in regulation. However, the Mountaineers scored the next 15 points of the game, shocking the Tritons by taking a 56-53 lead after a three-pointer by Western State with 32 seconds remaining. Senior guard Tyler Acevedo answered dramatically with a three-pointer off a pass from freshman forward Justin Brue, tying the game with 12 seconds left.
Despite the momentum from 
Acevedo’s final shot and two quick points in overtime from sophomore center Christian Hatch, UCSD once again fell behind. 
Forward Dan Biber’s jumper 
keyed a 12-2 overtime run for the Mountaineers, giving the team a 69-60 advantage. Acevedo hit another three with 11 seconds left, but Western State College responded with two free throws to seal the win.
“We did a really good job getting 
to a point and just didn’t handle the pressure really well, ” Carlson said. “We 
did a lot of good things in that game. Unfortunately, we didn’t take care of the ball. ”
Acevedo finished with 13 points, 
landing three of six three-pointers. Ryan played a solid game, adding five points and 10 rebounds. Brue scored six points and collected rebounds, two blocks, a steal and an assist in 24 min-utes of playing time. Freshman Jake Tarabilda also scored six points with three rebounds and two assists. As a team, the Tritons converted half of their three-point attempts, converted on 72.4 percent of their free-throw opportunities and out-rebounded the Mountaineers 52-37, but were undone by 17 turnovers — compared to only eight from Western State.
The Tritons look to get back on 
track on Dec. 4 as they head into CCAA play against a familiar foe: defending conference champion Cal State San Bernardino. UCSD lost by four points to the Coyotes in the second round of last season’s CCAA Tournament.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — After a chal-
lenging preseason that included games against 
Division-I opponents Stanford University and the University of San Diego, the Tritons opened their 2009-10 regular season with a hard-fought road victory in Phoenix, Ariz. 
The UCSD women’s basketball team 
defeated Grand Canyon University 71-70 at Antelope Gym on Nov. 21. Down by 15 in the first half, the Tritons rallied in the second period to tie the game and trump the defend-ing Pacific West Conference champs by one point to earn UCSD its first win of the season. 
“I think our effort and heart contributed 
most to our success, ” junior forward Tiffany Hunter said. “We were down by seven at half-time, and came out in the second half with relentless effort. We had the mindset to get a defensive stop on every play, crash the boards and quickly transition into offense. When we did those three things, we saw results that contributed to our success. ”
Senior guard Annette Ilg got things started 
for the Tritons, nailing a three-pointer right out of the gate. Grand Canyon  responded 
with a 16-6 run 12 minutes into the game and continued to dominate the first half, picking up the largest lead of the game when junior guard Samantha Murphy converted on free throws to stretch Grand Canyon’s  advantage 
39-24.
UCSD struck back with a three-point play 
by junior forward Tiffany Hunter and two free throws from Ilg, cutting the Antelope lead to 10 with 2:14 left in the half. Sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle battled to keep the Tritons within arm’s reach before heading into the locker room, hitting a three-pointer to close out the scoring for the first half. 
“I was really pleased with our fight and 
determination to get the win, especially when we were down by 15, ” head coach Charity Elliott said. “We could’ve folded, but instead we decided to dig down and get one stop at a time on the defensive end. Tiffany [Hunter] and Lauren [Freidenberg] did a fantastic job getting rebounds and putbacks, and Chelsea Carlisle did a great job hitting some big shots and directing us on both ends. ”
