Despite its initial lack of response, 
the UC San Diego administration 
was aware of the white men carrying 
signs and yelling statements insult -
ing women and members of the LG -
BTQ community on Library Walk 
on April 19, UCSD spokesperson 
Christine Clark con firmed to the 
UCSD Guardian. Clark noted that 
the men do not need permission to be on campus and were within their First Amendment rights.  
The men were stationed near the 
Silent Tree for the majority of the day, carrying a large sign that tar -geted feminists, single mothers, and the LGBTQ community through de-rogatory phrases and ideas. 
One part of the sign specifi -
cally read, “Feminists promote rape 
through: drunkenness, immodest 
dress, hanging out with homos. ” 
The men drew a sizeable crowd 
throughout the day, with many stu -
dents mocking or trying to argue with them as they shouted about how women should behave, all the ways in which college students are sinning, and other aggressive state -
ments. One man jumped up on a cement block and said something to the e ffect of, “ Any girls here who 
look half-decent probably want to have sex with me. ” 
Clark released a campus state -
ment to the Guardian, stating that the university administration de -
nounced the men’s actions.
“We condemn the hateful and 
repugnant messages that were be -
ing promoted that are counter to the values we uphold as a campus com -
munity, ” Clark said. 
The administration received 
some criticism on the day of the incident for its silence on the men’s behavior.

George T akei 
Gives Lecture on Internment and 
Online Activism
The Earl W arren College Law and 
Society Program paid T akei  $55,000, 
which is Takei’s regular speaking fee.
Renowned actor and activist 
George Takei visited UC San Diego 
this past Thursday to provide his 
DeWitt Higgs Memorial lecture 
Where NO Story Has Gone Before: An Evening with George Takei. The lecture focused on the long-lasting 
impact of the Japanese Internment 
Camps during World War II as well as included Takei’s personal experience and role in social justice movements. 
The DeWitt Higgs Memorial 
Lecture, hosted by the Earl Warren College Law and Society Program, features speakers the program 
believes to be holding highly-
esteemed critical roles in justice, society and law. Takei was chosen unanimously in July 2017 by the program’s faculty. Takei was the 
Grand Marshall in Seattle’s PRIDE 
parade in 2014; he has been active in several LGBT organizations, as well as the spokesperson for the 
Human Rights Campaign “Coming 
Out Project. ” 
Warren College Provost Emily 
Roxbury assisted in planning the 2018 lecture which took place in the Price Center Ballroom.
“George Takei’s standard college/
university speaking fee is $55,000, 
which we paid just as our sister UC 
campuses (UCSB and UC Davis) and many other peer institutions have done, ” Roxbury said.
Student fees were untouched for 
the payment, which originated from the “Council of Provosts of the six undergraduate colleges. ” 937 tickets were issued. 700 of them were given 
free of charge. 
“George Takei was selected 
because his unique personal 
experience and renowned 
professional work as an entertainer 
and activist touches on so many legal and social issues relevant to today, such as the Japanese American internment and its continued 
relevance to marginalized groups 
LGBTQIA rights including marriage equality, and the intersection of social media and pop culture with the principles of U.S. democracy, ” 
said Roxbury.
Takei was introduced by 
Associated Students President Lesly 
Figueroa, who briefly described 
the four acts of the lecture: 
Takei’s childhood in the Japanese internment camps, his education and early career in “Star Trek: The Original Series, ” his participation in 
the LGBT community and the effects

See TAKEI,  page 3In the UC Office of the President investments 
subcommittee meeting held March 13, UC 
Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh 
Bachher declared that of the three percent of UC stakes in fossil fuels, $500 million, would be reallocated away from nonrenewable energy sources. The decision was credited to fiscal reasons 
in conjunction with ongoing efforts made by 
the Fossil Free UC campaign, but included no timeframe of implementation. 
Investments from UCOP serve to support UC 
faculty pensions, retirement funds, endowments, and cash assets. Bachner reported that in addition to 
redirecting the $500 million, no future investments 
would be placed in stocks, assets, or equity funds tied to fossil fuels.  
“[The UC administration] is not making any 
new investments in oil and gas assets, ” Bachher said 
at the March UC Board of Regents meeting. “In 
addition, based on market risk, the UC system plans to reduce certain oil and gas holdings over the long-term while investing in [alternative] assets. ”
Throughout the meeting, however, Bachner 
made no mention of a “divestment, ” indicating no confirmation of fully retracting UC investments fossil fuels, a major concern voiced by the Fossil Free University of California movement. 
The FFUC campaign, a student-led organization 
across all 10 UC campuses going on for more than seven years, advocates for UC system funds to be directed at more alternate energy sources, 
and be completely diverted from carbon-polluting 
companies.  
Its “stop, drop, and roll” policy engages 
institutions to halt investments in the fossil fuel industry, drop remaining investments over a five-year period and roll out a reinvestment strategy 
that distinguishes its carbon footprint. While 
invigorated with the recent UCOP announcement, the organization understands that it cannot afford to lose momentum if further advances are to be made.

not place a vote to increase in-state 
tuition by 2.7 percent on the agenda 
for their meeting next month and 
will instead pursue more funding from the state government, the UC Office of the President announced 
today in an email. The 2.7-percent 
increase was originally proposed in January along with a 3.5-percent nonresident tuition hike, which has since been approved, but the Regents 
agreed to postpone the votes to 
May and March, respectively, after backlash from UC students and politicians. 
The Regents may place the resident tuition increase back on 
the table, however, depending on 
how much funding the UC system receives from the 2018-2019 state budget. While the budget has yet 
to be finalized, the initial draft 
released by Gov. Jerry Brown on Jan. 10 allocates approximately $3.7 billion in state funds to the university, which constitutes a 
3-percent increase from last year’s 
funding.
“While the [university] 
appreciates the 3-percent increase, 
that amount remains far below what 
is needed to address critical issues such as unprecedented student growth, increases in instruction and student services, and pressing 
deferred maintenance needs, ” the statement released by UC President Janet Napolitano and Regents Chair 
George Kieffer said.
Aiming for a 4-percent increase 
in order to respond to increased 
enrollment and the need for 
improved on-campus resources, the Regents indicated that they viewed this 3-percent increase as insufficient when it was first 
announced and that it was what led 
the Regents to consider tuition hikes to begin with. 
According to the statement, 
“the student-led advocacy efforts, done in concert with UC faculty, all ten campuses, and stakeholders throughout California” are attempting to gain an additional 
$140 million from the state. The email made no mention of specific actions the UC administration plans 
to take to secure more funding. 
Members of the Board also 
released statements expressing their 
support for the decision.
“This is another step in the right 
direction from the University of 
California, having previously seen the wisdom of punting its decision 
on tuition hikes before Sacramento 
agrees [on] next year’s budget, ” Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom said.
The budget will likely be 
negotiated until the June deadline for approval, so it is expected that the UC Regents will revisit the issue of tuition increases then.

Clark: The University Does Not Always Release Statements on Campus Incidents
Sustainability Collective Wants Regents to Discuss Divestment at May Meeting▶ PROTESTERS, from page 1
▶ FOSSIL FUELS, from page 1speech from hate speech and fails 
to recognize how these forms of ha -
rassment crease unsafe learning and 
working environments, ” the UCSD 
Student Workers Union posted to Facebook. 
Clark pointed out, however, 
that speakers on Library Walk, who 
comply with the campus policies on 
time, place, and manner, are pro -
tected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  
The statement also acknowl -
edged that the actions of these in -
dividuals were hurtful and claimed 
that the administration shares the 
frustration, anger, and concern felt 
by many. 
“A s  a  u n i v e r s i t y  c e n t e r e d  o n  d i s -
course and inquiry, we encourage 
members of our community to ex -ercise their free speech rights to op-
pose those expressing hate, as many did on that day and do so continu -
ously through their research, art, and teaching, ” Clark said. “Together, we can use our voices to collectively condemn and confront intolerance 
and bigotry. ”
When the Guardian asked Clark 
why the university did not release its 
statement condemning the men at 
the time the incident happened and 
instead responded only when asked about it, Clark declined to o ffer any 
additional commentary. 
“The university does not release 
statements for everything on cam -
pus, ” Clark said. “ There’s ongoing 
work on these issues all the time on campus, not necessarily just when 
an incident pops up. ” Clark also directed the Guardian 
to UCSD’s website on free speech, 
which states “Free discourse, how-
ever, is not always civil, respectful, 
or reasoned, and can sometimes be deeply o ffensive and hurtful. While 
at times, the exchange of contro -
versial ideas and opinions may be 
distressing to our community mem -
bers, it is important to recognize 
that the university acts as a home for 
diverse and sometimes contradic -
tory ideas and opinions. ”
Such demonstrations by men de -
grading women, LGBTQ persons, 
and others have happened annually 
in recent years. 
more direct level. 
“It’s not as intuitive to people, ” she 
said to the UCSD Guardian. “One, 
what it means; two, why they should care; three, what they can do about it. Divestment is something more 
abstract and a lot harder for students 
to grasp how [it’s] something that impacts their lives. This is a movement of students who recognize 
that their university should not be 
invested in these unethical practices, and [they] demand accountability for that. ”
Link-Oberstar emphasized the 
discrepancy between UC San Diego’s leading research targeting fossil fuels in contrast with its continued allocation of funds to this respect: 
“Especially at [UCSD], something 
that we’ve been pushing really diligently — a lot of the forefront of the research on climate change has been coming out of [UCSD] and 
the Scripps Institute, ” she reported.  
“So it’s very hypocritical of [UCSD] to put [its] money into fossil fuel companies when some of the most 
prominent researchers in the field of 
climate science are saying we need to stop extracting fossil fuels from the ground. ”
As leader of the UCSD Fossil 
Fuel Divestment campaign, Link-Oberstar is currently working on obtaining at least 50 student letters by this coming Friday and more 
next week to send to Bachner. These 
letters will explain the importance of shifting toward clean energy and demand a clear timeline for how this will be set forth. 
The letters to Bachner will be sent 
over the next few weeks, and thus far, they specifically come from other environmental groups on campus. In 
the coming weeks, SSC will call for 
students across campus to mobilize to have fossil fuel divestment placed on the agenda for the upcoming Regents meeting happening in May.

of his social media presence. In 
2012 Takei was named “the #1 most influential person on Facebook. ” 
Takei explained that “the 
defining event of [his] life was when [he] was a child” at the Japanese internment camps. He described 
the “stinging irony” of reciting the 
pledge of allegiance and saying “liberty and justice for all” at the beginning of his school days. 
“I couldn’t reconcile those 
shining ideals (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness) with my imprisonment, ” Takei added. 
Takei described his challenges of 
“maintaining a double life” instead of coming out as gay, for fear of ruining his acting career. 
“I thought I was the only one and 
it was a lonely feeling, ” Takei said. 
“Hiding a double life is a torturous 
life. When I started pursuing an acting career, I maintained that double life. ” He confessed that he 
did not publicly participate in the 
Gay Liberation movement until he came out in 2005. 
Takei admitted that his reasoning 
behind coming out was due to 
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
veto of California’s Bill to legalize gay marriage. Takei confronted the California Governor on the Howard 
Stern Show about the issue. 
“I’m very disappointed with you 
Governor Schwarzenegger because 
when you ran for office, you made all these moderate statements on 
various issues,” Takei recounted. 
“One of them being that you’ve worked with gays and lesbians in the motion picture business, you 
were very comfortable and that you 
had no problem with it, but when the real moment of truth came...you chose to go against all those things you said during the campaign. ” 
After the lecture, the audience 
was able to submit notecards with questions for Takei. Moderator and UCSD alumnus Cara Dessert, chief development and community 
engagement officer at The Center, a 
San Diego-based resource center for the LGBTQ community, has worked on several projects concerning 
immigration, reproductive health 
and LGBT equality. 
“I came to do that because those 
who came before me broke down 
those walls and barriers, ” Dessert 
said before turning to Takei to thank 
him. 
One audience member 
questioned Takei on how exactly social media has made an impact on 
his aim for equal rights,in which he 
discussed social media as a “global town square, ” a platform serving as a means of mass communication 
which extends beyond country lines.
“Now we’re discovering there’s 
a dark underbelly to social media, 
with these anonymous people called ‘trolls’ . It can be used for good, but 
the opposite can be used just as 
effectively, ” Takei stated. 
Warren Freshman Kristin Lee 
was one of the many fans who 
attended the talk. 
“I thought it was phenomenal, ” 
Lee said. “I enjoyed learning about 
his background and his speech about LGBTQ rights and everything. He 
had all the cards stacked against him 
and all the adversity he overcame-it was just truly incredible to hear him speak. ”

It’s not uncommon for a senior generation 
to criticize and pass judgement on the younger 
generations of the day. And, most of the time, these criticisms are entirely subjective and arbitrary. However, over the past few years, millennials have been criticized on many occasions for their objective ignorance when it comes to history. This is especially troubling given the crucial importance of a proficient knowledge of history, as yesterday’s successes and failures are our greatest resources when it comes to making decisions for tomorrow.
The reasonable and founded judgement of 
today’s history-hating young adults has been perpetuated by numerous studies and polls that suggest millennials severely lack historical awareness. In particular, one study demonstrated that two-thirds of millenials do not know what Auschwitz was. Similarly, this deficiency was brought to light when 82 percent of eighth graders who took the U.S. history test as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress performed below a proficient level. To once and for all condemn this young generation for its impious disregard for history, a published poll revealed that 19 percent of teens in the U.S. mistakenly believe that America declared its independence from either France or Canada.
Millennials often rationalize their 
disengagement with history by arguing that it has no bearing on their life, or that there is little to gain from such a time-costly pursuit. However, history abounds with actions that directly impact our current state of affairs and lessons that wholly connect to the problems millennials aim to fix today. One such example is that of Rodney King.
In early March 1991, Rodney King was 
brutally beaten by police officers who were attempting to arrest him after a high-speed chase. One year after the initial incident, three of the 
four officers tried for assault were acquitted of 
all charges despite the fact that, according to a 
Gallup poll, 76 percent of people believed the 
police to be guilty.
Feelings of injustice among Los Angeles 
citizens kindled flames that literally engulfed 
parts of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, as it wasn’t long before the expressed frustrations acutely directed towards police officers transformed into undirected and indiscriminate violence. The six-day Los Angeles riots left 50 dead, 2,000 injured, 12,000 in jail, and $1 billion in damages. By the end of it all, the rioters paid a hefty price just to leave the city of Los Angeles with no substantive change in police conduct.
The lesson to be learned from this historical 
event is one of prudence and sensibility. The riots that ensued after the acquittal of the police officers who beat Rodney King were not only an ineffective means of enacting social change, they were a devastating force that rocked the lives of the innocent as well. Millennials, when engaging in socially motivated movements, move closer and closer to this form of protest without knowing the consequences. Instead, they should continually look to the past for what actions do or do not institute change, for if their actions do not effectively and explicitly support their broader motive, the collateral effects could be terrible.   
This is but one instance in which history 
offers a valuable lesson to those who read it, and there are undoubtedly hundreds more. But, the sad truth of the matter is that millennials do not seem to care, and our institutions care even less. Although it’s true that history isn’t the most monetarily profitable vein of study, it is nonetheless an important subject that all students, irrespective of their disciplines, ought to learn. In this sense, a holistic education irrespective of major is of substantial value, as the only way to improve upon the past is to know a little history.Sun God Festival is supposed to be “the highlight of the UC San Diego undergraduate student experience,” 
a mission that should be easy to achieve on a campus known for its lack of socially-
engaging experiences. That being said, in 
recent years, it has only managed to “build a sense of community” by disappointing the 
student body with its lineups and its ever-
increasing regulations. This year’s festival 
represents the culmination of these problems, 
with apparent organizational problems and a very poorly received group of artists. The 
structure of Sun God as a festival has become 
a vehicle for poor planning and coordinating 
decisions, and that means student funds are 
being misused so that A.S. Concerts and Events can play a knock-off Coachella in our 
own backyard.
 I f  S u n  G o d  i s  t o  c o n t i n u e  e x i s t i n g ,  i t  
should do so as a one-stage concert. Breaking 
it up into two stages is unnecessary when attendance is limited to undergraduate 
students. By creating two separate venues 
there is an inherent need to book enough acts 
to fill them. Quality over quantity should be 
the priority of the event, something that is 
often forgotten under the brand of establishing this as a festival. It would be lovely to book 15 
acts that are appealing to a large segment of the population to put on a proper festival that 
caters to all music tastes, but this is getting 
harder and harder to do as concert fever 
has created a music industry geared around 
live events. Finding enough artists that are 
available on a given weekend in the peak 
of the spring concert season is a logistical 
nightmare for a college campus. Instead, book 
a big artist and two or three openers and invest more money on activities or food instead of trying to assemble a line-up around any 
artist that happens to be available and within budget. The overwhelming amount of security 
is another drawback of having such a large 
event, which puts the campus community at 
odds with public and private law enforcement 
to create unnecessary tension. If the event becomes smaller in nature, there should be 
more money available for more well-known 
and well-received musicians, both because 
of less organizational expenses and because 
there wouldn’t be a need to hire so much security. 
Funding for Sun God is partly taken 
from student funds, yet these very students 
have rather limited avenues to decide how 
this festival will occur. This year, A.S. Council allotted $730,000 to Sun God, which 
constitutes 67 percent of the concerts and 
events budget and almost 15 percent of the 
overall budget for the academic year which 
is a very significant amount of money for very few to be in charge of. Student input 
should be at the forefront of this festival and 
not just through a mass-emailed survey that 
goes out once a year in October. The Sun God 
committees should be able to be held By: Adriana Barrios // Editorial AssistantMotorcycles are certainly the 
ideal mode of transportation, 
especially for those wishing to be 
rapidly and irreversibly transported 
to the afterlife. These human death machines leave passengers 
completely unprotected, so it is 
no wonder that motorcycle riders die at a rate 29 times higher than 
those driving cars. However, 
there are no mass protests calling 
for the eradication of any and all 
motorcycles in the nation. People 
realize that informed adults have 
the right to make choices and take risks for themselves. Besides, when 
motorcyclists feel a need for speed, 
society benefits. Those deaths lead to a steady and superb source 
of grade-A organs. Motorcycle 
helmet laws greatly cut back on the supply of organs in an already 
tight market. In order to ensure the 
sick of this country have access to life-saving transplants, helmet laws 
should be either scaled back or 
removed altogether to ensure that there are always enough organs to 
go around. 
Other than a few, every state has 
passed some form of a motorcycle helmet regulation, and there has 
even been discussion of a potential federal mandate requiring helmet 
usage. Helmet regulations can 
either be partial or universal. Partial 
helmet laws are explained by The 
Community Guide to “apply only 
to riders who are young, novices, 
or have medical insurance coverage 
below certain thresholds.” On the 
other hand, universal helmet laws, 
which are enforced in 19 states 
including California, require the 
compliance of all motorcyclists 
regardless of one’s age, experience, 
or insurance. 
According to estimates done by 
the federal government, helmets 
decrease the likelihood of fatality 
by 37 percent and decrease the 
likelihood of brain injury by 
67 percent. Such a decrease in 
fatalities has been correlated with a decrease in the supply of organs. 
In fact, a study done by Michigan 
State University found that after a 
state repeals its motorcycle helmet 
laws, there is a 10-percent increase 
in organ donations from people in 
motor vehicle accidents. 
Motorcyclists provide the 
public with a lot of bang for its 
buck, as a single person can yield 
enough organs to save up to eight 
lives. They tend to be young, in 
fairly good health, and mostly only 
suffer from brain injuries after their 
accidents. Thus, they do not have 
your run-of-the-mill organs. Au 
contraire, theirs are of the highest-
possible quality. 
Whether or not someone wants 
to take life-saving, preventative measures should be a matter of 
choice. After all, unlike drunk 
driving which damages the organs 
of everyone involved and harms 
society as a whole, motorcyclists 
who choose not to wear a helmet 
hurt no one but themselves. So why 
don’t you grab a motorcycle, forget 
your helmet, and save some lives? “Fundamentally, the 
way in which this event 
is structured needs to 
be reevaluated, because 
with each passing year it 
resembles less of the core 
of what it was supposed 
to be.”Ride and Die

accountable throughout the year to ensure that the 
event in question is aligning to the interests of the student body. Although the element of surprise can create momentum and excitement around an event, it can also create a larger disappointment when the 
selections are not what the students would’ve wanted. 
Clearly, maintaining a direct democratic process 
with more than 27,000 students is not easily feasible, 
but maintaining a more open reporting system with 
the student body and doing a better job of advertising the ways in which people can get directly involved 
with the committee would be a start.
The rest of the money that pays for the event 
is acquired through sponsorships, either from other A.S. Council departments or from private 
corporations. This is just another drawback of trying 
to coordinate an event of these proportions — the necessity to outsource to private organizations for 
funding. If it reduced the number of artists and 
planned a concert instead of a festival, costs would be more manageable. Otherwise it falls on A.S. Council to have to fundraise the rest of the event, meaning 
corporate interests interfere with the affairs of a public institution. It undermines the values of public education to have to resort to private enterprises and it undermines A.S. Council too. One of the sponsors, for example, is a private radio station which is in direct competition with the campus’s own KSDT radio station, a student service under A.S. Council. It brought competition to its own service in order to 
fund a festival that left most unhappy.
Fundamentally, the way in which this event is 
structured needs to be reevaluated, because with each passing year it resembles less of the core of 
what it was supposed to be. A.S. Council needs to 
remember the bigger picture when coordinating 
events, ensuring that what it plans is tailored to the 
current campus population and that it isn’t simply 
going through the motions. The future of Sun God 
should rest on the people paying for it and the elected student government should be responsible for seeing that the people who pay for both the event and its 
own salaries are actually happy with the finished 
product.

Boasting close to 28,000 members, the largest UC San Diego meme 
page — officially named “UCSD Memes for Sleep Deprived Tritons” — can be said to have become an integral part of the UCSD 
community. In the short year and half since its creation in November 2016, this page has grown to define an entire student body, encapsulating UCSD culture through shared jokes and experiences. 
However, in the span of just a couple weeks, this all came close to falling 
apart.
It all began with a single post. On March 21, in the midst of rising 
tensions during finals week of Winter Quarter, Faraz Noor Shaikh — creator of the page — posted a series of texts between him and “Timmy Triton” creator Andrew Diep, Sixth College first-year. These texts included an exchange in which Shaikh bullied Diep, denying him access to posting many of his comics on the page as well as putting Diep down in the process. With phrases such as “Stop acting like a damn five year old, ” “piece of s---, ” or even “Y ou are beneath me, ” peppering the conversation, it was not long before people became outraged.
From angry reacts to spiteful memes and comments, the post almost 
immediately blew up with criticism against Shaikh. Comments such as “This is what happens when you give people with low emotional intelligence a slight taste of power” or “ > become meme page admin > realize this is the best thing that’s happened in life > ‘you’re beneath me’” were constantly being hurled at the post. In fact, one of the comments by Sharon Oh, receiving 50 reacts, read, “ A lot of memes on this page are recycled anyway??? ‘You’re beneath me’??? He’s a content creator spending a lot of time to make comics for the people not for admin??? Damn you’re messed up lmao … nice apology dude. ” 
Another comment receiving 30 likes by Trang Le said, “Faraz it’s nice 
that you shared how you talked to this guy, but honestly you’re an asshole. Hopefully you don’t get hurt over me saying that (triggered!) but Jesus look how you’re treating this racoon guy! They’re memes! Unless it’s child porn or a dog getting thrown off a cliff, let people meme whatever they want … smfh. ”
From there, the drama only escalated. In the span of a mere two weeks, 
a second meme page entitled “UCSD Memes for Revolutionary Teens” was brought up, quickly gaining around 4,000 new members. Initially filled with memes against Shaikh and self-entitled “[s---posts], ” the competing meme page quickly became the basis for the “Meme Revolution. ” Posted on this page was also a Google document that included several of Shaikh’s “crimes” and instances of bullying, thus only fueling the fires of revolution even more. Led by former “UCSD Memes for Sleep Deprived Tritons” meme page administrator Nick Lin, current “UCSD Memes for Sleep Deprived Tritons” meme page administrator Armin Jorgensen, and other members from the administrator team, the “Meme Revolution” was short but radical, consisting of several negotiations between the administrator team and Shaikh. 
“The original plan from the beginning was to cut off contact with Noor 
Shaikh and his page, and create our own page, where our goal was to grow, compete, and overtake his page, ” said Jorgensen in a press release. “Our pages ran separately and competed with one another … Negotiations at this point were tense and not very productive. I made a decision as administrator to let our group vote publically on whether or not to accept Shaikh’s deal, and it was defeated with more than 600 votes against and approximately 20 votes for. In hindsight, I made a mistake in allowing it to go to a public poll, as the public was not in a position to make a reasonable decision. ”
It was from this point that a final decision was reached. On April 2, 
after a meeting between Shaikh and Jorgensen, the conclusion was made to merge the two pages, thus making the “UCSD Memes for Revolutionary Teens” page into a complete [s---post] page (now entitled “Sp00ky Geisel 3rd Floor [S---Bosts]”). On top of this, Shaikh was forced to step down from his administrator status until at least the end of Fall Quarter 2018, thus leaving the leadership of the page up to the rest of the administrator team.
Y et, with the overthrow of Shaikh long past, the initial fires of anger 
slowly dying down, and the main page resuming itself to “life as usual, ” the great “Meme Revolution” seems, to many, to be one major overreaction. Even throughout the revolution, the attitude of the general public seemed to be one of indifference or annoyance at the drama, with only a select few actively engaging. With no visible major impact made upon the memes themselves, many have come to question: Was the whole revolution completely necessary?
According to Lin, it was. “ A lot of times I think he was just overreaching, ” Lin commented. “He 
was trying to benefit himself over all the other people, right? I think it really got into his head. And then I told him, ‘Maybe you should quit. I think it’s kind of way over it. ’ But he was like, ‘Nah, nah, nah. I’m gonna keep this page because, oh man, this is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. ’ ... I honestly don’t really care about how he runs the page. My main concern was how he was treating other people. That was what motivated me to like actually start the whole thing. ”
Surprisingly, Shaikh also seems to agree with this sentiment. Despite 
being harassed with several hateful messages and the occasional death threat, Shaikh agreed that the revolution led to many positive outcomes. 
“I banned raccoon memes and Andrew messaged me about it, ” Shaikh 
recalled. “I was really rude to him at first and then I went on to bullying him as well, telling him that I don’t respect his opinions and stuff like that, which is really wrong of me considering in an interview before I told [the UCSD Guardian] I created a community space and stuff, so it really went against that. … And the way I was running the page, in retrospect, wasn’t correct either. The last time I talked to [the Guardian] it had like 8,000 members. And it tripled. So it has 27,000 now. And when the page encompasses such a large community, it needs to be run with a better infrastructure, better order, which I wasn’t adhering to. I was still running it like it [had] 100 members or whatever. Which is why when it was made such a big deal, I realized that what I’ve been doing is super wrong. ”
This gets to the point of what the revolution was all about. Aside from 
the wrongs that Shaikh committed through heavy censorship on the page, he went against the very nature of the page and bullied another student. Having been such a integral part of the community, “UCSD Memes for Sleep Deprived Tritons” has created a whole hodgepodge of raccoon, Professor John Eggers, Asian Baby Girl, science technology engineering math vs. humanities, UCLA-reject, Division 1, Cardi B, hate-preacher, UCSD lecture podcast, and Piazza culture that is unique to our school — a culture that is meant to be inclusive of everyone. To deny someone from being a part of that, to bully someone for wanting to contribute to that, is a massive  
With the self-titled “Meme Revolution” occurring just a 
couple of weeks 
ago, witnessing the 
overthrow of Faraz 
Noor Shaikh from his own Facebook page and the creation of a competing meme page, a lot has happened to the main UC San Diego Meme Page in a short span of time. However, despite all of the drama, many have remained indi fferent 
to it. Th is brings into

Looking Beyond Stereotypes: 
Disproving Misconceptions About Islam
 
In today’s post-9/11 world, Islam is often misunderstood. 
Negative stereotypes having nothing to do with the religion continue to persist, and discrimination against Muslims in 
the U.S. has increased since the 2016 election. As this bias against and fear of Muslims becomes deeper ingrained into mainstream 
American culture, it is more important than ever to address the 
problems Muslims face and why they exist in the first place. 
As a national nonprofit organization that focuses on promoting 
unified Muslim communities for students on college campuses, the Muslim Student Association works to do just that. According to its website, the MSA “strives to facilitate networking, educating, and empowering the students of today to be citizens of tomorrow’s community. ” Its list of guiding principles includes phrases such as “love is our highest aspiration” and “tolerance is the banner of our 
outreach. ”
“This is a community that holistically caters to as many Muslim 
students as possible, ” explained Thurgood Marshall College junior 
Shafeen Pittal, the vice president of the MSA at UC San Diego, who is majoring in political science. “We are trying to institutionalize the Muslim student experience on campus, whether that’s by reaching out to the administration and asking for resources we may need, or having events that may provide spiritual, academic, or social help, or just making sure that the Muslim students have a support system 
and community on campus. ”
Some MSA events include the annual Justice in Palestine Week, 
which informs the UCSD community about Israeli occupation 
and the Palestinian experience, and Islam Awareness Week, which educates students about Islam. The MSA also fights for social justice by organizing protests and other solidarity demonstrations.   
It has membership of Muslims with backgrounds from all 
over the world. Muslims practice Islam, a worldwide religion that teaches monotheism and adherence to the Qur’an and Sunnah, 
the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. The term “Muslim” is 
not a synonym for “ Arab” or “Middle Eastern” (a concept often misunderstood), and not all Arabs are Muslims. In fact, many people living in the Middle East actually practice other religions such as Christianity or Judaism. And just like Christianity and Judaism, Islam is also practiced worldwide. There are African Muslims, Asian Muslims, Pakistani Muslims, and Indian Muslims, for example, and the MSA reflects this diversity.
“There are lots of ways for us to unite, and we don’t get into 
politics, ” Pittal said. “It’s just a community for anyone who feels comfortable in that space. ”
The MSA offers a safe space for one of the most marginalized 
religious minorities in the United States. Now more than ever, Muslims are falsely associated with radical extremists who routinely abuse the name of the religion for personal gain. America is quick to scapegoat Muslims for terrorist attacks even though most acts of domestic terror have actually been carried out by white nationalists with no ties to Islam. President Donald Trump himself perpetuates 
these harmful stereotypes, famously declaring “I think Islam hates 
us” during a 2016 CNN interview with Anderson Cooper, and instituting the Muslim Ban last year, which involved suspending the Syrian refugee program and banning entry from several Muslim-majority countries, resulting in confusion and despair among many families, including U.S. citizens. 
“ All of these ideologies were prominent even before the Trump 
administration came into power, ” Pittal said in reference to racism and Islamophobia. “They’ve always been in America —  they’ve been a part of our country’s make-up for so long — but now they’ve been given legitimacy because of President Trump. And that’s the 
problem. ”
She believes this harmful stereotype of Muslims as terrorists 
is perpetuated by negative portrayals of Muslims in the news 
and in other forms of media. The lack of diversity in newsrooms and in the media industry overall prevents important stories and perspectives of minority groups from being shared. This absence of awareness can lead to the spread of harmful misconceptions, which develop into deeply ingrained, and often unconscious, biases 
against minorities. 
“The media is fueling [Islamophobia], ” Pittal said. “It’s a very 
complicated platform to look at. But if you look at any culture, 
any religion, there are always those people who use that religion to advance their own interests that have nothing to do with the religion or the culture. There [are] Hindu extremists, there [are] Buddhist extremists, but those religions aren’t dealing with the same characterizations that a lot of Muslims are. So, I think it’s really important to think why we’re scapegoating Muslims. We need to analyze how this is translating to biases in the way we think and deal with certain groups and work on recreating these frameworks 
with more inclusive, educated rhetoric and mindsets. ”
For example, many people often misinterpret the Islamic 
principle of  “jihad” as “holy war” because they have only heard 
it in the negative — and false — context of extremists using it to justify their violence. “Jihad” is neither a declaration of war nor an act of violence. It actually means “struggle, ” which according to the Qur’an, means striving to be a better person and a better Muslim. 
Such misconceptions have harmed the broader Muslim 
population. Innocent people are the victims of deadly assaults and 
hate crimes by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But a fact usually 
overlooked is that most of the people killed in terrorist attacks are actually Muslim, and most Muslims are vocally opposed to ISIS and other terrorist groups. 
“ At the end of the day, they’re not Muslim, ” Pittal declared, 
explicitly distinguishing radical extremists from Muslims. “I can’t even make that association because there is no connection. Those people are taking my religion and giving it a false name, giving it a false image in the country, in the world. Why do they have the 
platform for 1.7 billion Muslim people?”
Extremism isn’t the only stereotype that has been assigned to 
Islam. Additional debates concerning Muslim women who wear 
the hijab, or headscarf, are abundant, and the meaning of the hijab is a highly contested topic. 
“Islamically, women are commanded to cover by God, ” Pittal 
explained. “So are men. So both women and men are asked to cover and lower their gazes and engage in a lifestyle of modesty and God-consciousness. But the covering for women and men is different. 
Men have to cover from their navel to their knee, and women have 
to cover everything except their hands and their feet and their face. ”
However, in some cases, the aspect of a Muslim woman covering 
herself has become a political conversation. This is because external factors such as governments, cultural influences, and heightened Islamophobic environments have made it so. The hijab continues to receive severe backlash, especially in America — the land ironically known for its freedom of religion. 
According to a 2016 report done by the Council of American-
Islamic Relations, the hijab is one of the top five triggers of anti-Muslim bias incidents. A 17-year-old Muslim girl in a hijab, Nabra Hassanen, was beaten to death by a man with a baseball bat last summer. The police refused to describe the incident as a hate crime even though part of the reason why Hassanen was murdered was because her hijab made her a visible Muslim. 
With women who wear the hijab experiencing so many hate crimes, it is necessary to question why the hijab is perceived so negatively. Although these negative opinions can produce consequences ranging from microaggressions to hate crimes, they remain severely problematic no matter the scale of the bias, and many people are unaware that they’re contributing to the problem. In fact, much of the criticism Muslim women receive is actually 
from feminists who are supposed to be their allies. 
As an ideology, feminism holds that all women have freedom to 
dress or think as they choose. Y et many self-proclaimed feminists 
act against this idea by telling Muslim women that they are oppressed. As Pittal points out, “By telling me that my choice of covering is oppression when I am telling them otherwise, are they not the ones taking away my freedom to choose how I live my life and silencing my voice?”
For Pittal, who chose to start wearing a hijab in seventh grade, it 
has been an extremely meaningful experience. 
“Whether that’s modesty, empowerment, or liberation, a hijab 
is this way that I wear my faith on my head and I’m reminded to constantly be God-conscious, ” she said. “It has allowed me, personally, to be a lot more confident in myself. For me, the hijab has been a source of empowerment. It’s for no one, it’s not for any man, for any woman, it’s just simply in devotion to my creator and my religion. It’s an external manifestation of an internal state of being. ”
Islam is a religion of peace that carries deep meaning for many 
people and Pittal encourages others to study Islam in order to understand the positive principles Muslims hold true. 
“Regardless of what people think or believe, ” Pittal said, “if they 
simply made an effort to study Islam from authentic sources, they themselves would realize its beauty that anyone, Muslim or non-Muslim, can be inspired and moved by. There’s this underlying and remarkable theme of mercy, compassion, and love both by God [toward] His people, and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be 
upon him) to his companions and followers. And this should be 
practiced by the followers of Islam. There’s this constant emphasis in Islam about working to be a better believer, a better person — not just as a creation of God, but [toward] other creations of God. It is this constant state of belief, this flickering foundational, beautiful faith, that is the light in my experience as a Muslim, in my existence as a human being, as Shafeen. ‘Light upon light’ is one of my favorite phrases from the Qur’an. So as we all engage on this campus, let us strive to beautify ourselves, each other, and our 
communities with light. ” 
UCSD MSA discusses how it’s time to analyze 
the negative stereotypes and misconceptions that further the discrimination o ften faced by Muslims.▶ MEMES , from page 6

 An  Overreaction?violation of power.
For someone like Andrew Diep especially, this was 
extremely painful. As one of the few original content creators on the meme page, Diep has been drawing his “Timmy Triton” comics since the beginnings of his freshman year. To him, “Timmy Triton” is an outlet of expression and a way to connect to UCSD culture. For him and other content creators as well, this means that the revolution has, indeed, been well worth it. 
“The majority of people did support the revolution, but 
there’s half of the people that think it’s a joke — more like, ‘Why is there a revolution for the meme page? It’s just a 
meme page. ’ But to me it’s basically the media of UCSD. It’s 
the culture, it’s the media: It’s all embedded inside the meme page, ” Diep stated. “There’s a lot of misinformation around about the meme revolution. Most of the people think it’s just because of me, that I’m angry at Faraz. That’s not really true. The meme revolution basically gives the freedom to content creators to create content. Having more content creators control the meme page is [better than having] one person because the meme page is basically the culture of UCSD. … [I think the revolution was important] for future generations. I know that there will be freshmen coming in — talented freshmen, content creators. I don’t want them to go through the things that I went through. ”
At the end of the day, whether or not it was necessary, the 
“meme revolution” did happen. While it may not have made an extremely visible difference, the ability to post content freely without arbitrary censorship is one that should be highly valued. The meme page provides a space for creators and students to express themselves, a space where their voices — and complaints — are heard and reaffirmed. It is 
here that community has been created and sustained. Just by 
looking at the support that Diep received through it, it can be agreed upon that this community is a strong one. 
“Y ou saw the community support that Andrew received, 
and how the community came together, and that’s great, ” Shaikh commented. “It shows that we’re not socially dead, that we’re very socially awake. Y eah the stigma for UCSD is ‘UC Socially Dead. ’ But this just shows social unity. ”For Shaikh as well, although he will no longer be an 
administrator of the page, the forceful break has a redemptive element to it. After apologizing to Diep and formally stepping down, Shaikh came to the conclusion that it was healthy for him to get away. 
“Stepping away helps. The meme page has been a big part 
of my UCSD life so far. A lot of people recognize me as ‘the guy who started the meme page, ’ you know, ‘the guy who started it all, ” Shaikh commented. “Thinking about that and how I was wrong, it hurt me but it made me think, ‘Wow I need to change parts of my life. ’ And stepping away gave me that opportunity — that I don’t have to think about this 
anymore. I can think more about academics, about more 
projects that I want to do. … In retrospect, I’m really happy. ”

Truly one of the most (if 
not the most) ambitious crossover events in movie 
history, “ Avengers: Infinity War” manages to meet the incredibly high bar it set for itself, striking a balance between action, humor, and plot 
without slowing pace or losing the 
audience. 
“Infinity War” picks up right 
after the post-credits scene of “Thor: Ragnarok, ” and quickly reveals 
itself to be much darker than its 
predecessors. The movie’s villain, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is on a mission to collect the six Infinity Stones, 
to harness their unique power, and 
gain the ability to alter reality with a snap of his fingers. Throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)’s 18 movies, the locations of five of the 
six stones have been revealed, with 
two on Earth and three on other planets. 
The movie is split into 
three different subplots which simultaneously force our heroes’ paths to cross and separate them into small groups spread throughout the galaxy. While some of our heroes try to find and kill Thanos before 
he collects all of the infinity stones 
in space, others protect and attempt to destroy the ones on Earth before Thanos’ henchmen can find them. 
Finally, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), 
Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) set out to forge a new weapon that can kill Thanos.
Those who are new to the MCU 
may have a harder time understanding all of the references and jokes in the movie, but directors Anthony and Joe 
Russo do an excellent job of weaving 
the most important plot details into the characters’ introductions. After all, the characters haven’t watched the other films either. 
The most dangerous aspect of 
this film — the size of its cast and diversity of its characters — actually became one of its strongest features. 
The transitions between subplots 
were handled elegantly, with just enough time in between to move the story along without letting the audience forget what else is going on. They also kept the narrative moving 
at a brisk pace, making a movie that’s 
almost three hours long seem half that.
Where the storyline lacks action, 
the characters make up for with humor; where it lacks humor, there are emotional, heartfelt moments to remind us that heroes are fragile too. The depth of this movie is 
thanks to the 10 years that Marvel 
spent creating it, allowing audiences to understand and connect to the characters and their values. With Loki 
(Tom Hiddleston), Marvel created a 
nuanced, morally-gray villain, and surprisingly, “Infinity War” gives Thanos the same treatment. Much like Killmonger in “Black Panther, ” 
Thanos identifies a valid problem but 
comes up with the wrong solution. In less than three hours, “Infinity War” gives Thanos an origin story that 
gives him more dimension than most 
of the characters in the DC Extended Universe.So where does “Infinity War” fall 
short? For one, it doesn’t give us many new character relationships. 
Although the characters are 
separated at the beginning of the film, they mostly remain with the people they’ve already known. 
Notably, the Guardians of the Galaxy 
meet Thor, but soon after they get separated, and there’s not much dialogue between Thor, Rocket, and Groot. Similarly, Iron Man and 
Spiderman meet Doctor Strange, but 
the conversations between the former two characters are very similar to those in the previous movies — Stark 
treats Parker like a child, and Parker 
tries to prove him wrong. 
Secondly, due to the sheer 
magnitude of this movie, several of the heroes’ whereabouts and stories 
are barely mentioned, while others 
receive much more attention. In particular, romantic storylines are explored a lot more than in previous 
films. Although this allows for 
character growth and adds another dimension to the film, it seems irrelevant at times. 
To be clear, the interactions 
mentioned above are included for 
comedic relief or used to explain the 
plot, and they brilliantly achieve their purpose. However, the film could be improved by including comedic 
dialogue between new characters, 
or replacing some of the romantic moments with scenes involving characters who don’t get as much screen time. 
While “Infinity War” isn’t perfect, 
it accomplishes an incredibly difficult feat amazingly well. It’s also only the first half of the story, so there’s 
plenty of time for more character 
and story development. Overall, the fight scenes are epic, the story is an emotional rollercoaster, and the ending will leave you reeling and 
hungry for “ Avengers 4. ” Given the 
ambition of the project, it is easily the best Marvel movie so far. We waited 10 years for this film, and it definitely 
does not disappoint.

It was Week 3 of Spring Quarter, and 
while some might have been dealing with Coachella withdrawals or anticipating the 
second weekend, San Diego offered solace for those who were not fortunate enough to score $500 tickets. A handful of artists who made up Coachella’s iconic lineup conveniently also made a pit stop at San Diego in between the two 
weekends. Canadian indie-pop band Alvvays was 
one of those artists, and The Music Box was the host for its Wednesday night show.
The opener, Frankie Rose, started the night 
dressed in a hoodie and jeans. The stage was dimly lit with a backdrop of flashing lights, which helped transition into Alvvays’ brighter 
and simpler stage setting.
Alvvays opened with “Hey, ” an upbeat track 
full of catchy guitar riffs that successfully ignited 
the crowd. Lead singer Molly Rankin’s soft vocals carried across the venue as the crowd bobbed 
their heads along to the riffs. The band followed 
with hits like “ Adult Diversion, ” “Not My Baby, ” and “Your Type. ” Most of the night consisted of tracks from their latest release “ Antisocialites, ” 
which, judging from the mass of hipsters and 
beer drinkers that pushed their way closer to the stage for a listen, was a fast favorite. The band urged the crowd to sing along to the catchy bop, “Plimsoll Punks, ” earning an enthusiastic 
response.
Rankin’s platinum sleek hair and solid red 
ensemble embodied the band’s minimalist and 
quirky style. During the transitions between 
tracks, she connected with her fans through 
casual conversation 
— spanning subjects from 
her day out in San Diego to her favorite movie, “Powder. ” The crowd clearly loved Alvvays’ 
newest tracks, yet the night couldn’t be complete 
with old favorites from the band’s 2014 self-titled album. “ Archie, Marry Me” was the climax of the show, featuring Rankin crooning the chorus with a remarkable level of delicacy. Fans couldn’t help but join in for her high notes and sway their 
hands in the air. “Dreams Tonite” was a more 
mellow track that cued dimmed stage lights and cellphone glows in the air as Rankin softly crooned, “In fluorescent light / Anti-socialites 
watch a wilting flower. ” The moment perfectly 
captured Rankin’s melodious vocals and the band’s mesmerizing compatibility with the soft drum beats and bass. 
The band declared the last song of the night 
to be “Party Police, ” which imbued the energy in the venue with a subdued yet endearing sense of farewell. “Y ou don’t have to leave, you can just stay here with me, ” Rankin murmured gently, before 
bidding farewell and exiting the stage. However 
Alvvays had no intentions of disappointing the crowd, and as fans begged for an encore, Rankin returned and thanked the crowd before jumping into the band’s redemption of “Blue” by Elastica 
and Alvvays’ own “Next of Kin. ” The Music Box 
may not be Coachella, but Alvvays sure brought the hype to San Diego.

Re s e a r c h
Co n f e r e n c eThe Guardian : So, this is your first film, 
and it’s going around the festival circuit, and 
you’ve already won at Sundance Film Festival. 
What has that experience been like for all of 
you?
Keire:  I mean, for me, it was something that 
I never really expected going into this. It’s just 
really beautiful, honestly, to see how far we’ve 
come, especially being 14 or 15 and being asked, “Hey, can I interview you?” I was just 
like “Yeah!” and I didn’t know what it was for, 
or where I was going. It’s just been amazing, being able to travel and meet a bunch of 
people. It’s definitely something I feel I would 
not have had without Bing and Diane for sure. I love y’all.
Diane:  We love you too! I think for me, I 
just loved the experience of working with 
Bing, and meeting all the people in the film 
and working with them. I’m so grateful for the reaction from the audience. You know, it’s 
rewarding to hear that critics love the film, but 
to see how it’s affected the audiences and how much they’ve embraced the film has really 
meant a lot to me.
Bing:  I mean, I love how it’s affected Keire 
and Zack and Nina as well, and I love working with great people and Diane, our co-editor 
Josh Altman, and sound mixer James Labrecht, composer Nathan Halpern, and and 
the Kartemquin family. We’re still very much 
in it, so it’s hard to get perspective just yet.
G: So, right now we’re at the San Diego Asian 
Film Festival. Do you think being Asian-
American has affected your filmmaking in any way?
B: I mean, certainly. I don’t know if you’ve 
seen the film, but there’s an aspect that deals 
with what it means to find your racial identity as it pertains to Keire. For a while, people in 
rough-cut screenings and feedback screenings 
were telling me that “you gotta take that out, it’s too distracting from the family or 
fatherhood themes, ” but I just kept trying to 
make it work, and it wasn’t until we premiered it at Sundance in January, and I think I flew 
out end of November, early December to get 
the final interview [with Keire] that really locked [it] into place. It was just the realization 
that if we just connect racial coming of age 
with the lessons that Keire’s father was trying to impart on him, that would both satisfy 
the main arc of Keire’s story, which was his 
relationship with his father, but also be able to keep that nuance in there with what it 
means to navigate dual racial spaces. Within 
that was how I was able to deal with what I felt like I experienced growing up, which 
was similar to Keire’s navigating these two 
worlds of this white friend group, but also this Chinese identity. It takes an emotional 
toll on Asian-American boys when they grow 
up in communities that don’t really have an Asian-American community to latch onto. 
I’m also an immigrant, so I feel like all these 
sort of coalesce into an outsider viewpoint. I’ve always felt like I was on the outside, but 
within that helps me get better clarity on how 
everything is constructed in our society.
G: So, some people have compared your film to “Boyhood, ” and then they’ve also said it’s a 
very complex look at masculinity in the 21st 
century. What do you think about that?
K: I personally haven’t seen “Boyhood” yet, 
but I can kinda see how it could be compared 
to it by just how we were filming for so long. 
You kind of just see us all grow up. I don’t know, I don’t really know what I’m trying to 
say.
D: Yeah, I agree with Keire. The fact that the 
film goes over a long period of time, which made “Boyhood” so different and interesting, 
Bing does that too. You see Keire when he’s 11 and now he’s a mature 22, so you do see 
that growth in them, but “Boyhood” was so 
centered on one young man, and this is really the story about friendship and community. 
So I see that as different, but definitely seeing 
that footage over all the years, I could see why there’s that comparison. 
B: I mean the expanse of time is there. I think, 
ultimately, it’s really easy for people to sort 
of grasp onto other cultural reference points 
in order to enter into a piece of work that’s complex. It certainly is about masculinity as 
well. A couple days ago in Sarasota I just did 
a panel about masculinity with a women and gender studies professor at a local university, 
and we broke open all the ways that this film deconstructed masculinity and showed 
examples of how it’s a performance over the 
course of an hour.
G: I have a question for Keire. At the end of the 
film, it’s revealed that you got a sponsorship, so what has that been like for you?
K: It’s been really amazing, honestly. For 
the most part, it’s been a huge money saver, because before that, a lot of my money just 
went to skateboarding, and it’s just like me accomplishing a dream of mine. I’ve always 
wanted to be sponsored by companies that 
actually like and care about you. I just hope it continues, I hope I don’t get hurt or anything. 
Yeah, it’s just been an amazing ride, honestly. 
It’s something I never actually thought I would ever accomplish, I guess, but yeah, I’m really 
thankful.
G: There are two moments in the film that 
I wanted to ask about. So one moment was when you were interviewing Keire, and then 
you tell him that you approached the film because you found common threads in your 
experiences concerning abuse, and then when 
you’re interviewing your mom. She says that whatever it takes for you to heal, you need to 
do that. So, did you approach the film with the Q&A with  Minding the  gaP

I hope you are in the mood for a sizzling and slightly salty 
review because that is today’s house special. On April 24, a friend 
and I went to Mavericks Beach Club in Pacific Beach to get a taste of the food and the establishment. It is a restaurant and club for those 21 years of age or older, catering well to people in their 20 
and 30s. The restaurant boasts an extensive 15,000-square-feet 
area. Five bars make up the entire restaurant and club, and each bar area serves a unique purpose. One area has an ocean view, another has an indoor area for private parties, and the other areas are outdoors. Depending on which area you go to, you can experience a causal, business-like, or playful atmosphere. With both indoor and outdoor space, 38 TVs, plenty of seating areas, a fire pit, couches, purse hooks under the tables, and even a rooftop bike valet, Mavericks has thought of everything. I have to say, its efficient 
and functional use of every bit of space is impressive. Additionally, 
they have a calm but fun beach theme throughout the club shown through artwork on the walls, pictures on the tables, coolers along the bars, indie pop music, and overall design. It creates a clean and refreshing ambiance.
Now, on to the delicious details. Mavericks has a simple and 
easy-to-understand menu. With classic American and Mexican dishes such as California fries, tacos, burritos, wings, tostadas, and tortas, the menu variety is not outstanding, but it serves its purpose for the bar-club setting. The snacks-appetizers range from $4 to $28. The main menu dishes range from $6 to over $20, depending 
on the add-ons you choose. Based on how much food you get, the 
prices are very reasonable.
First, I will be discussing the appetizers, or “snacks, ” as the club 
labels them. My friend and I ordered the Puffy Tacos and Wahoo Tostadas which came with a mild salsa and lime wedges. Once the dishes arrived, my first impression was that they are a fairly large snacks; each came with three tacos or tostadas each, making them actually a decent meal size. The presentation of the dishes was clean, despite the fact that the dish itself was loaded. The tacos were 
a favorite of mine. Because they were puffy, they held their shape 
when you bit into them, instead of just falling apart. The only minor downside to this is that the bottom of the tacos were slightly soggy, but the flavor of the tacos was so good that I did not really mind. They were savory, juicy, not overly salty, and not too heavy. Next, the tostadas. I found this dish to be a messy eat; however, the flavors of the corn tortilla and the lime crema were a shining redemption. The overall taste of the dish was not as flavorful as the tacos, but it 
was not at all bland —just lighter. Also, the addition of crispy leeks 
on the top of the tostadas was seemingly minor but truly made a difference; having the crunch of the tostada on the bottom, then the chewiness of the chicken, the softness of the tomatoes and avocados, and then the final slight crunch of the fried leeks on top 
was a textural success. I also feel as if I should mention the salsa. At 
first, I thought it was more of a sauce than a salsa. In all honesty, it tasted like marinara sauce with lime juice and a pinch of spice. Not only was the taste strange, but it did not compliment the dishes well.
Moving on to the main dishes, I ordered a shrimp torta with 
guacamole and fajita veggies. The presentation was simple: The sandwich split into two and held together with skewer-like sticks with the same previously mentioned salsa. This precaution did not make eating the torta any easier, though. The sandwich was 
quite soggy on the bottom and was too flimsy. Adding to that, the 
flavor just was not there. I expected the shrimp to have more of a kick to it because I could smell some nice seasoning, but it was lost in translation.The ingredients themselves were high quality, but overall, it tasted like a cheesy bread sandwich with some unseasoned shrimp and fajita veggies and guacamole. My friend ordered a 
carnitas burrito, which came with chips and salsa. It continued the 
trend of subtler flavors despite high quality ingredients. The burrito had carnitas, beans, rice, cheese, pico, and pineapple salsa, which was better than the standard salsa. The addition of the pineapple salsa was a unique twist to the traditional dish. Its sour and sweet flavor complimented the simple ingredient list.
Mavericks Beach Club has put an incredible amount of thought 
into its space and decoration, but I wish it would put more of an effort into its menu. On one hand, there are the snacks, which are 
delectable and fun. I highly recommend trying the Puffy Tacos and 
Wahoo Tostadas. On the other hand, the actual main dishes leave room for more to be desired. Also, the space is very welcoming and casual, but also fun and exciting. In conclusion, I would definitely go back to Mavericks for the snacks; and if the beachy, feel-good Our entire experience at Smokeyard BBQ and Chop Shop was critically defined by its brussel sprouts. Dressed in 
a blanket of reduced bourbon and maple, it was humble, full of depth, and unexpected — considering this restaurant is meant to satisfy carnivorous cravings. But the idea of this small, green package expands into the ambiance, menu, service, and vision of Smokeyard. Here, there’s an understated tone of mixing the unusual together to create a space where there’s something for everyone.
Located at La Jolla’s Westfield UTC, this five-month-old eatery has already built up quite a reputation for its daily 
happy hours and impressive ability to cater to a variety of demographics — from the bar-hopping college students, 
to the working professional, and even the young family. Manager Andrew Platt hopes to see this Mammoth Lakes 
transplant become a staple in the San Diegan UTC area, opening up opportunities at the bar, tables, and outdoor patio for all to come and enjoy together. 
Back to the brussel sprouts. Chef Matt Sramek — a classically trained chef with an esteemed background linking 
him to the bites of Beverly Hills — offers this as an appetizer that sets the tone for the rest of the menu. Pretty for the eyes, and sweet on the tongue, this $12 plate was enough to be a stand-alone meal. But paired with the crispy rock shrimp starter, which were mixed with a chili garlic aioli and reminded us of honey walnut prawns, the combination offers familiar foods in an unconventional setting. Though the bed of shredded cabbage and shockingly bright yellow peppers haphazardly sprinkled on top make the dish look less appetizing than it actually is, these melt-in-the-mouth 
crustaceans have an unanticipated lightness that pair well with the more filling brussel sprouts.
And for the 21-and-over crowd, there is an impressive array of libations to complement the meal. There are 
classic selections of beer and wine, mules and lemonades; but there is also a Smokeyard Elixir, a blend of kombucha, 
El Jimador tequila, and a pineapple citrus juice. At first sip, the sugar rim accentuates the sweetness and acidity of the juice, but the kombucha easily overrides the other flavors with the tequila leaving a strong aftertaste. An interesting mix, but a beverage selection that is consistent with the idea of the unexpected coming together.
Moving right along into the mains, the food consistently attests to Sramek’s talent and ability to navigate 
traditional ingredients with a variety of cooking styles. A barbeque sampler showcases a perfectly seasoned chicken, well-cooked tri-tip, and a set of literal fall-off-the-bone St. Louis spare ribs. Next to this marathon of meat is a platter 
of three accompanying sauces: sweet chili, Smokeyard BBQ, and mango habanero. Disappointingly, the Smokeyard 
BBQ sauce crosses the line from smoky-sweet to “Wow, this tastes like a cinnamon roll, ” but the sweet chili is the perfect poultry partner, and the mango habanero is a refreshing addition (that actually tastes like mango, as opposed to an artificial concentrate) to an otherwise heavy meal. 
The sides speak for themselves — both the bacon and jalapeno mac and cheese and charred cauliflower are 
exactly what one would expect them to taste like. Definitely not bad, but after those brussel sprouts, one really can’t compare. 
And just when we couldn’t eat anymore, an apple berry cobbler, warm from the oven and crowned with four 
perfectly sized scoops of vanilla ice cream, was set before us and devoured in five minutes. With a fruit compote and 
cinnamon biscuit topping, that tasted more like a sweet cornbread, the cobbler was the perfect bookend. 
Overall, Smokeyard is a space we hope to see remain constant in the ever changing topography of UTC. A 
place for anyone and everyone, this minimally decorated yet incredibly well-thought-out eatery is full of honesty, 
intention, and transparency — both metaphorically from its menu selection and warm service, and physically, to the literal open bar, kitchen and floor to ceiling windows. A space for all community members, Smokeyard offers a “kids eat free” option for Mondays in May, free wine or dessert for all mothers on Mother’s Day, and live music for all to enjoy starting this summer season. 
All in all, come for the brussel sprouts, stay for the cobbler, and allow Smokeyard to remind you that it’s always 
better together.

What is one meal that takes you back to a childhood memory?
Annika:  Shrimp sinigang, easily. This meal has had such a profound impact on my 
youth that I actually based my Common Application essay around it two years ago. 
Sinigang is a sour soup made with tamarind and filled with whatever vegetables and 
protein you’re in the mood for. It takes me back to Sunday lunches after church at my 
grandparents’ house in the Philippines, where the adults would sit around the huge 
dining table, and the kids spilled into the living room, watching whatever was on the TV . 
Brittney : My grandma used to make this Vietnamese sour fish soup, with bean 
sprouts, pineapple and tomatoes; so pretty similar to what takes you back to your childhood. For us, we’ d eat this while watching “Mary Poppins, ” one of three VHS tapes my grandma owned. In some sense, this meal was like a cultural bridge for my grandma and us. Our Chinese would never be enough, but there was still an understood love for 
one another. She would cook and we would eat, with “Mary Poppins” in the background 
to fill empty silence, though none of us knew what was going on in the movie. 
A: That’s really cute. It’s interesting that both of our memories touch on family and 
gathering, and it shows how much power food has in transcending language and in communicating emotion. 
B: Amen.
What role does food have in your life?
A: Recently, I feel like I’ve had a love-hate relationship with food — I played soccer 
in all of middle and high school, but in college, I quit sports entirely and wasn’t doing any regular exercise. Freshman year, I ended up forcing myself to eat foods that I didn’t necessarily like because they didn’t make me feel as gross or as heavy. Eating became a practice of simply trying to sustain myself, and I didn’t feel like I could ever “treat 
myself ” to sweets or other junk foods because I wouldn’t be burning it off. Now, I’m 
gaining a better sense of how to balance my health with the occasional cupcake, but it’s been a long process. 
B: You played soccer? I can’t believe you never told me, it’s been a year. Anyways, I 
really resonate with what you mentioned about food becoming nothing more than just sustenance. I think food, at least in the past four years, has been very transient and a hodgepodge of whatever I can find in my fridge. However, this past month, food has become this communal practice. A lot of my cooking tends to miss a lot of ingredients, mostly because I am lazy and will not find the energy to drag myself to Ralphs. It’s been 
through the grace of my apartment mates that I get to have breakfast and dinner. It’s 
as if the practice of eating is synonymous with gathering and my practice of cooking is interdependent with what I can offer and what has been graciously offered to me. 
A: I agree with your theme of gathering. Before college, my mom, my younger 
brother, and I all ran on different schedules, so even though we lived in the same house, we didn’t see each other much. I would often have dinner in the car on the way to practice or bring my homework to the table because I couldn’t spare 15 minutes. When I go home during breaks, I really make an effort to have a meal with my family at least once a week, because I realize now how important that time is. 
B: Do you feel like that’s helped change the dynamic in your family? Or help you all 
get to know one another better?
A: I think it’s definitely allowed us to create closer relationships — we implemented 
a rule of no phones so we have to talk to each other to fill the silence. I love hearing about their days — especially my brother’s, who is notoriously stubborn about telling me anything — and it’s a very comfortable space where we can just sit and enjoy one another’s company over some good food. 
 
Summarize your college experience through a meal. 
B: Can I get a four-course meal? One course per year? I think the first course might 
just be a Goody’s burrito. Maybe because I worked there, but, it’s pretty symbolic of my 
attempt to know this campus better. I guess my 18-year-old self thought making burritos was the best way to do so. My second course would probably be just a cup of coffee. It helped my understanding of “coffee is more than the five shots of caramel in a latte, ” but 
also was a lifeline for the many all-nighters I pulled because all of a sudden life got so 
much busier. I’ d follow that with some pancakes; for some reason, I always had a five-pound bag of just-add-water pancake mix at my apartment as a way to be able to offer food in case people were over to study or to hang out. I think that’s all, I still am trying to pinpoint this year’s course. Obviously these things probably don’t taste the best all together, but you get the point. 
A: I would have to go with a creme brulee. I think the first half of college was weird 
and confusing, but I’m in the process of breaking through that outer shell and getting to the core. 
B: What is it, like, creamy now?
A: Uhh...I would say denser? Thicker? More substantial?
B: Fair enough. Creme brulee is good, sophisticated. But it can be innovative while 
sticking with its roots. I feel like I could see that in you. 
A: Oops, did I answer the question wrong? Creme brulee isn’t a meal.
B: Dessert is a meal. Lifestyle Living Room
by Annika Olives // Lifestyle Editor and Brittney Lu // Associate Lifestyle Editorconscious intent of trying to heal for yourself, and for everyone 
who was part of the film — you, Keire, and Zack —  how do 
you think the film has affected you?
K: I feel like the way that this film has affected me in a positive 
way. I’ve gotten closure —  you’ll never get over a death, but you’ll be able to deal with it in a more positive way, especially 
when your friend comes to talk to you about it. It’s something 
that none of my friends but Bing have ever done, like none 
of my friends have ever been like “Yo, like I heard about that. 
How are you feeling?” They’re just like “Oh! Here’s alcohol!” 
I feel like seeing and hearing other people’s stories because 
of the film that they watched, it’s heartwarming. It makes me feel kind of like I’m doing the right thing, which is something 
I usually don’t do. Yeah, I guess the film affected me in those 
kinds of ways. Just being able to grow as a person and get over issues that were [...] were holding me back.
B: I certainly went into the project thinking that this was 
another step toward confronting my childhood and a lot of 
issues that I had faced. When I was growing up, when I was a 
teenager, when I was in my 20s, I feel like I would be the guy at parties who would sidle up to people and get them to talk 
about their parents because it would make me feel like I wasn’t 
alone, hearing other people’s problems. Eventually, I felt like I got really good at being a pseudo-therapist. And so in doing 
this film, it was a continuation of that sort of work, and I think 
I was using Keire mostly, but also Zack to a certain extent, as proxies for exploring these things that I felt I couldn’t explore 
on my own. So we did it as a team, and then eventually when 
I entered the film as a character, I ended up having to go see a therapist because things got a little tough for me, and that 
helped give me clarity. I don’t think I would’ve done that if I 
wouldn’t have done this film, but ultimately, it’s the Q&A, the press circuit, and everything that has happened since the film 
has been released that’s been the space where I’ve been sort of 
able to grow and discuss. When I’m making the film, [...] I’m just like “What’s next? I gotta get Keire to talk about this. We gotta fill in this story gap, ” but now it’s like, now I can take a 
step back. I can get press, and I can get asked questions.
G: Kind of building off of that, what was it like to see 
Zack falling into that pattern of abuse, and showing abusive behaviors? There’s a moment where you ask Keire, “Do you 
ever think he could be abusive?” What was it like to have to watch that? 
K: It’s kind of a hard subject, just because I wasn’t really 
around for a lot of it, so I wouldn’t ever know any of that stuff 
until I saw the film. Whenever I came around, Nina and Zack 
were just really nice with each other so I never — of course I’ve seen them argue, but I’ve never seen anything physically 
violent or emotionally violent or anything like that. I don’t 
know, it’s just a weird thing for me to comment on because I don’t know too much about that situation, so that’s just kind of 
my statement on that. 
B: I mean, I feel like I’ve witnessed enough in my own 
upbringing and I feel like I knew enough about the cycle of violence at that point that it wasn’t super surprising. You know, 
I think there’s a stigma in society of about who an abuser is, and they don’t want to confront the fact that it could be your 
best friend, it could be your neighbor. I think it’s just this 
inability for society to grapple with the fact that some people are just complex — they’re not monsters, they’re not altruistic, 
100-percent angels. People are complex and I think Zack is 
very much a complex person, as we sort of unpack who he is in the film. I mean, it wasn’t super surprising but what was more 
problematic for me was morally what to do, because I’ve been 
making this film about both [...] the subject and about him, and I guess “How do I handle this in the film?”
D: Bing does a great job of showing that Zack is a very complex 
person, and that — by no means — are we trying to make him 
a bad guy or a good guy. We’re just showing that there’s really 
difficult situations, and there’s a lot of gray in a lot of things, and I think he’s very brave to be sharing his story. Bing always 
says that we still have to hold him accountable for his actions, but we have to understand that life is complicated. 
G: On a lighter note, just because this is a college publication, 
what do you think about people who don’t skate wearing Thrasher?
K: For me personally, I feel like as long as you understand the 
culture and you have respect and love for it, I don’t care if you 
wear Thrasher. But there are people who play off the clout that it gets like “Yeah, I wear Thrasher, ” and people will see that 
and be like “Oh, sick. That person’s cool, and they’re wearing 
Thrasher, ” and I just, I can respect it a lot more when the person has a common respect about what we do. I guess there’s 
people [who] just do it for the clout. 
B: Yeah, I mean we just had dinner with Tony Hawk, and 
we were just talking about how he’s [...] very much involved in making sure skateboarding gets bridged in a healthy way 
into the Olympics, which is what’s happening right now. We were talking about how there’s going to be people giving flack 
towards skateboarders, but in a sense it already happening. 
You know, like the main shoe companies — there’s no more independent shoe companies. There’s just Nike, New Balance, 
and Converse for the most part. I mean, it’s already happening, 
but at the same time, the skate shop owner that I interview in the film, he wrote on a skateboard a long time ago the distilled 
messages that despite all the trends or fashions or whatever, 
at the end of the day, you skate, and you love it or you don’t. There’s no replacing that, and it’s a super hard learning curve. 
You get hurt, and it’s like there’s no rhyme or logic to why you 
keep doing it. You know, there’s always going to be that core culture and that core love that’s never gonna be touched by 
capitalism or trends or fashion.

SPORTS  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , APRIL 30, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 15
From April 26 to April 28, the UC 
San Diego Tritons baseball team split 
a four-game series with the California State University, Los Angeles Golden Eagles 2–2. The two wins for the 
Tritons clinched a California Collegiate Athletic Association tournament berth 
for the fifth straight year. Tournament 
play will begin on May 9.
Game One
Triton bats proved too much for 
CSULA in the 6–3 victory in game 
one of the four-game set. UCSD added one to its win streak extending it to a season-long nine games without a loss. 
Senior starting pitcher Mitch 
Hickey got the ball on Thursday and 
delivered for the Tritons. Hickey finished with 5.1 strong innings of 
pitching allowing only 6 hits while striking out 3 and picking up a win. Hickey struggled early in the game allowing the CSULA Golden Eagles to jump out to an early 2–0 lead in the top of the first inning. Shortly a fter, 
Hickey settled in and only allowed 3 hits and no runs for the remainder of his outing. 
UCSD wasted no time answering 
back to the Golden Eagles, putting up 2 runs in the bottom of the first tying 
the game 2–2. Freshman shortstop Shay Whitcomb led the inning o ff 
with a 4-pitch walk, then back-to-back doubles by redshirt junior right fielder 
Zander Clarke and redshirt junior third baseman Alex Eliopulos knocked 
in both Whitcomb and Clarke. The 
game would remain tied at 2 runs for 
several innings.
In the bottom of the fourth, the 
Tritons took advantage of sloppy play by the Golden Eagles and tacked on 3 more runs which would be all they would need for the rest of the game. Redshirt sophomore catcher Nick Kitzmann was hit by a pitch 
and redshirt freshman center fielder 
Brandon Stewart followed that with an 
infield bunt single back to the pitcher. 
After that, CSULA junior starting 
pitcher Angel Lerma was clearly frustrated and lost command of his pitches, hitting Whitcomb to load the bases with only one out. He was not 
the only Golden Eagle in his own head; 
following a ground ball by junior first 
baseman Tyler Durna, Golden Eagles senior first baseman Nic Bereaud 
committed a throwing error on a routine play which allowed Kitzmann 
to score giving the Tritons a 3–2 lead. 
Next up, Clarke came up big again for the Tritons, giving them a couple insurance runs on a 2-RBI single to center field, his second and third RBIs 
of the game. 
After a meaningless seventh-
inning run by the Golden Eagles, the Tritons held on for the 6–3 victory. 
Redshirt junior Cameron Kurz worked 
a scoreless 1.1 innings, closing out the game for his 8th save on the season.
Game Two
After Thursday night’s victory, the 
Tritons saw the end of their nine-game winning streak on Friday, dropping game two of the series 6–5. This was a 
seesaw battle featuring 4 lead changes 
that ended with the Tritons on the 
bottom.
Junior southpaw Preston Mott 
got the ball on Friday night but was knocked around for 10 hits on only five innings pitched. Mott was able to limit the damage to only 3 runs, but ultimately the bullpen was not e ffective 
either, allowing 3 runs in their four 
innings of work. Mott finished the 
night with a no-decision.
The Tritons got the game started o ff 
well putting up a run in the bottom of 
the first inning. Eliopulos knocked in 
right fielder Clarke who had reached on a 2-out error by Golden Eagles junior starting pitcher Joey Deceglie.
The Eagles soared right back and 
put up a run to tie the game in the top of the second and the Tritons themselves answered back in the bottom half, taking the lead 2–1.
After a scoreless third inning, 
both teams would score again in the fourth with the Golden Eagles putting 
up a run and tying the game 2–2. 
The Tritons answered back again, 
putting up 3, moving the game to 5–2. Whitcomb is responsible for the 3 runs as he launched a homer deep over the left center field wall and into the 
twilight sky.
The Tritons’ pitching could not 
hold this lead as they gave up 3 runs over the next 2 innings which le ft the 
game tied at 5–5 going into the ninth.
In the top half of the ninth inning 
with Tritons closer Kurz on the mound, the Golden Eagles were able to score the go-ahead run on a pair of hits from 
senior designated hitter Jorge Garcia 
and senior center fielder Sean W atkins. 
With their backs against the wall in the bottom of the ninth, the Tritons were unable to tie the game, losing 6–5. This 
was a heartbreaking loss for the Tritons as not only did they blow a 3-run lead, but their season-high nine-game win streak came to an end.
Game Three
After splitting the first two games of 
the series at Triton Ballpark, the series moved to Los Angeles for a Saturday double-header to round out the final 
two games of the series.
In game three of the series, the 
Tritons pounded the Golden Eagles 11–4 and avenged their win streak 
which had ended the day before.
The Tritons struck first in the third 
inning, putting up 3 runs on 3 hits. 
Redshirt sophomore utility Steven Schuknecht led o ff the third inning 
with a single toward right field and was followed by another redshirt sophomore, le ft fielder Keenan 
Brigman, who also had a base hit to right field putting runners on the 
corners. A fter a wild pitch, Schuknecht 
crossed home and Brigman advanced to second. Redshirt freshman center fielder Brandon Stewart reached on 
an error and then stole second while Brigman stole third. Durna knocked 
in both runners on an opposite field 
double down the le ft field line, giving 
the Tritons a 3–0 lead.
The Tritons put up 3 more runs in 
the top of the fourth inning thanks to 
an RBI double by Schuknecht, an RBI 
single by Brigman, and an RBI single 
by Clarke which in total put the Tritons up 6–0. Triton bats were hot all night as they put up 2 more runs in the fifth 
inning and 3 more in the eighth inning for 11 total runs on the night. 
Every Triton hitter reached base 
safely in game three, runs were scored by seven di fferent players, and runs 
were knocked in by six di fferent 
players. The Tritons showed that 
hitting is truly contagious and they all got sick together, scoring 15 total hits. Brigman was especially locked in that day as he had 3 hits, 3 runs, and an RBI. 
Triton arms were good in game 
three as it only took the work of two pitchers to get through all nine innings. 
Senior starting pitcher Jack Rupe, Jr. 
pitched six strong innings allowing only 3 runs and freshman relief pitcher Cameron Leonard followed suit with three strong innings of his own picking up his second save of the year as the Tritons won this one 11–4. 
This was the Tritons’ 30th win of 
the year and clinched them a spot in 
the CCAA Championship for the fifth 
straight season
Game Four
After the nine-inning daytime 
victory, UCSD could not come back in 
a seven-inning loss of 7–5. UCSD looked to be in business 
early as in the top of the first inning, 
Durna and Clarke both drew walks, giving the Tritons a runner in scoring position with only 1 out in the first. 
Sadly for the Tritons, they could not cash in as the next two batters were sent down in order. 
CSULA, however, did cash in on its 
first-inning opportunity. With two outs 
in the bottom of the first and runners 
on the corners, Golden Eagles junior left fielder Spencer Sundahl singled, 
knocking in two runs and giving the Golden Eagles a 2–0 lead. The Golden 
Eagles added 1 more to their lead in the 
bottom of the third inning a fter a triple 
and single o ff Tritons junior starting 
pitcher Jonah Dipoto.
Dipoto never quite settled in, as the 
Tritons’ pitcher was knocked around 
for 7 hits and 6 earned runs in 5.2 innings.
The Tritons showed signs of life in 
the top of the fourth when Whitcomb 
singled to center field scoring DH 
Blake Baumgartner. Durna followed 
that with a clutch 2-RBI double, scoring Whitcomb and Brigman. 
CSULA counter-attacked this 
Triton resurgence with 4 runs of its own in the bottom of the sixth which pushed Dipoto out of the game.
Down 7–3 going into the bottom 
of the seventh, the Tritons needed a comeback but came up just short, losing the game 7–5. 
With the loss, the Tritons split the 
series 2–2 and move to 30–16 on the year. Next week, the Tritons square o ff 
against California State University, San Marcos in another four-game series rounding out the regular season before 
starting tournament play on May 9.
Tritons’ Nine-Game Win Streak Comes To a Close on Friday
Despite only splitting their series over the week, UCSD clinched a spot in the CCAA Championship before a final regular season series.

COntributing Writer
lucas armstrong  lqarmstr@ucsd.eduThe No. 12 UC San Diego women’s 
water polo team took on McKendree University in the quarter final matchup 
of the Western W ater Polo Association 
Championship. The tournament 
took place at UCSD’s Canyonview Aquatic Center over the course of three days, April 27 to April 29. The 
Tritons earned the number one seed in the tournament, and they looked every bit the title as they made easy work of their opponents with a 14–2 win over the 8th-seeded McKendree. With the victory, UCSD moved on to the semi finals where it faced Sonoma 
State University. The Seawolves had 
no answer for the powerhouse that is the Tritons, as the host earned a 
convincing 11–1 victory to book their 
spot in Sunday’s final. 
Game v. McKendree 
UCSD had control of this matchup 
versus the No. 8 seed from start to finish 
as they went on to win comfortably by double figures, 14–2. The Tritons 
scored 8 goals before McKendree scored its first.  
UCSD totaled 31 shots in the game 
compared to McKendree’s 18. The 
Tritons had total control of the game and caused the opponent to commit mistakes, including seven exclusions penalties.  
Freshman attacker Robyn Carter 
led the Tritons with 4 goals, while junior utility Carly Innis contributed with 3 goals of her own.
Game v. Sonoma State 
On Saturday, the Tritons faced o ff 
against Sonoma, and it was business as usual for the host, earning a 11–1 win.  
The lone goal for Sonoma came 
in the opening quarter as it was the first to score, earning a 1–0 lead with 
almost half of the first quarter gone. 
From there, it was all Tritons as they went back to score 11 straight to earn a comfortable victory at the end.  
Carter added 3 more goals to her 
weekend tally as Innis and sophomore utility Jessee Ransone each added 2 
goals of their own. 
After the win, UCSD dominated in 
Sunday’s final against California State 
University, East Bay, 12–2. Next up, the 
Tritons look to make some noise in the 
upcoming NCAA Championship.16 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , APRIL 30, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Steve Scott 
Invitational
The team will look to rebound at 
the CCAA Championships, which 
start on Thursday, May 3.
The UC San Diego track and field 
team recently competed in the Steve 
Scott Invitational. The invitational, 
spanning from Friday, April 27 to Saturday, April 28, was held at UC 
Irvine. The Tritons did not have the 
strongest showing at the Invitational, 
but several athletes did finish in the top 
10 of some events. 
Senior Meghan Fletcher placed 
second in the women’s 400-meter hurdles with a time of 1:01.05. Junior Kelly Strand finished at seventh at 
1:02.73. At eighth, sophomore Claudia 
Cox had a time of 1:02.77, right behind 
her fellow Triton. Sophomore Melissa Seaman barely finished out of the top 
10, finishing with an 11th-place time of 
1:03.962. 
For the women’s triple jump, 
redshirt junior Tais Marinho-Gomez came in fourth with a score of 11.92 meters in her fifth and final vault. 
Prior to the vault, Marinho-Gomez had missed all four of her vaults and was at risk of finishing without a score. Fortunately, she was able to focus and finish strong. 
Junior Esther Nofodji gave the 
Tritons another top-10 finish with a 
43.55-meter throw, giving her 10th place in the women’s discus throw. 
On the men’s side, senior Paul 
Doan earned a third-placed finish in 
the men’s 100-meter dash with a time of 10.527, barely beating the runner behind him by 0.002 seconds. 
For the men’s 400-meter dash, 
sophomore Makhai Husband ran a 50.03 to place 10th in the race. 
Sophomore Josef Polk finished fourth in the men’s 400-meter hurdles with a time of 53.13. In the same event, freshman Kiasa Salgado came in at 
ninth with a time of 54.96.
In the men’s high jump, senior 
Brett Molster jumped 1.91 meters to 
place fifth. In the men’s pole vault, 
freshman Evan Shimasaki jumped for 4.75 meters, enough for a ninth-place finish. 
For the men’s hammer throw, senior 
Josh Makieve threw for 52.88 meters 
that earned him sixth place. Fellow 
Triton senior Mason Falahat placed in 10th with throw of 48.52 meters.Senior Cole Mears placed third in 
the men’s javelin throw with a score of 57.64 meters. 
Overall, the Tritons did not have 
their strongest showing but look to rebound at the California Collegiate Athletic Association Championships. The CCAA Championships start 
on Thursday, May 3 and run until 
Saturday, May 5.UCSD @ Hawai’i Paci fic — 
Honolulu, HI
On Saturday a fternoon, the No. 
4 regionally ranked UC San Diego 
women’s tennis team faced o ff 
against top-seeded Hawai’i Paci fic 
University in the NCAA Division 
II West Regional Tournament. A fter 
splitting the results of two separate 
competitions prior to the postseason match, UCSD saw its 2017-18 
campaign conclude in paradise with a score of 5–1. With the loss, the Tritons finished the season 13–11 
and within the top 20 teams of the nation. 
UCSD fell behind 2–1 a fter 
completion of the doubles 
competitions. Triton duo junior 
Ashley Chao and sophomore Becky Chou dropped the first outing 8–1 
to HPU’s 15th-ranked Lena Lutzeier and Oceane Adam. Moments later, UCSD juniors Alexandra Weil and Madison Hale were defeated as well in a hard fought 9–8 tiebreaking battle. Regardless of the previous 
matches, junior Chloe Wight and 
senior Nousha Nowamooz refused to go down and provided the Tritons with their first team point of the day 
with another closely contested 9–8.
The top three of the six single 
competitions would consist of intense meetings stocked with six nationally ranked individuals. No. 22 Chao was challenged by the best player in the country, unfortunately losing in consecutive sets, 6–1 and 6–2. The matchup for No. 14 Chou 
was not any easier as HPU’s third-ranked Lara Meccico won in straight sets 6–2 and 6–0.
In the No. 3 spot of the singles 
matches, Weil battled until the last point of a 6–3 and 7–6 encounter when the Shark’s No. 34 Adam closed the door and sealed the deal for HPU. Three singles wins would do the job to yield a final 5–1 Shark 
victory. Given the outcome, the rest of the matches would score as unfinished and not count toward the 
players’ win or loss record.
HPU will continue its playo ff run 
and look to improve a 19–2 overall record heading into the NCAA 
Championship bracket full of the 
last 16 teams alive.
