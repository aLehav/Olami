THURSDAY WEDNESDAYDining-Dollar 
Exchange to Begin in May
By Ayelet Bitton
Associate News Editor
Early next month, students will be able to sell any 
excess dining dollars to their peers as part of a new 
program erected last week by the Housing, Dining and Hospitality Department.
At an April 23 meeting, the Housing and Dining 
committee voted to approve the exchange program, which will allow students to transfer any desired number of dining dollars from one student account to 
another for a self-selected price. From May 3 to June 6, students will be able to pick up a form from the Hospitality Services building to request such a trans-action.
According to HDC 
Committee member and A.S. President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine, the program is aimed at students who may not be able to use up their dining dollars at the end of the year. Currently, 74.1 percent of students living in the residence halls have used fewer of their dining dollars than the HDC budget schedule recom-mends, while only 10.3 percent have used more.
“It is a good idea because a 
lot of students end up leaving the year with a lot of dining dollars left on their plan, and there is no form of reimbursement, ” Ben Hassine said. “It’s a good route. ”
Sixth College committee rep-
resentative Parminder Sandhu said students will be able to sell their dining dollars for any price agreed upon by the two parties involved. 
“ All HDH does is move the dining dollars, ” he said. Program will allow students to 
unload leftover meal points.

An A.S. resolution demanding that 
the university stop working with com-
panies associated with human-rights violations has come under fire from members of the pro-Israel campus community. The resolution was drafted by 
members of several campus organi-zations — including Students for Justice in Palestine and the Student Sustainability Collective —  and approved by Transfer Senator Adam Powers and Campuswide Senator Desiree Prevo.  According to Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh — a co-sponsor of the res-olution — the council was inspired by a similar effort at UC Berkeley, where the resolution passed 16-4 in the student Senate, but was eventually vetoed by 
Berkeley A.S. President Will Smelko.
The resolution calls for the UC sys-tem to stop investing in companies 
such as General Electric and United Technologies, which supporters of the resolution claim promote violence by providing technology — such as heli-copters and aircraft engines — to war-ring countries around the world. 
Sixth College senior Leena Barakat 
— who helped draft the resolution — said the UCSD version was altered to ensure that it condemned human-rights violations as a whole, and not specifically actions taken by the state of Israel. According to Barakat, it is the second such resolution to be proposed at an American university, the first being at Berkeley.
“We really tried to make the bill 
more universal and clarify that to uphold the ideals of corporate social responsibility, we should divest from U.S. companies that are benefitting from occupancies elsewhere, ” Barakat said. “The bill is really watered down 
from the one at Berkeley, which directly 
targeted Israel — but we mention other areas such as Iran and Morocco. It is not anti-Israel. ”
She acknowledged that any official 
change in the university’s investment procedures would have to be decid-ed by the UC Board of Regents, but said that similar resolutions have been influential in the past. She referred specifically to an instance when Nelson Mandela identified the university’s divestment from South Africa as an important factor in ending the apart-heid reign in that country.
“Of course, the actual decision will 
go to the regents, but it is a call to divest 
to show that we are listening and we 
understand, ” Barakat said. 
A.S. Engineering Senator Adi Singer 
— a member of the pro-Israel commu-nity and creator of the Facebook group 
Proponents say the 
measure is meant to condemn human-rights violations worldwide.See DINING DOLLARS page 2:<5.6+
Event planner attributes rapid sale of guest tickets — which dried up three weeks earlier than expected — to hype over musical lineup.
By Hayley Bisceglia-Martin
News Editor
This was a bad year to put off buying Sun 
God tickets for your friends. By April 22, all 3,500 tickets for the festival had been sold — just two and a half weeks after 
they went on sale. 
Like last year, the tickets could be purchased 
starting April 5 for $41 each. In order to curb the number of non-students attending the festival, A.S. Concerts & Events maintained the policy that guest tickets must be purchased by a UCSD student or employee, with a limit of two tickets per person.
A small number of alumni tickets — included in 
a $55 package that offers dinner on RIMAC Field — are still available on www.alumni.ucsd.edu. While students and faculty buy guest tickets from a pool of 3,200, the Alumni Association normally sets aside 300 tickets for its members.
Last year, guest tickets didn’t sell out until the 
week of the festival. Associate Vice President of Concerts & Events Alex Bramwell attributes this year’s speedy sell-out to increased off-campus hype about the artists performing at this year’s festival — including Drake, Michelle Branch, B.o.B. and DJ Z-Trip.
“We have the same number, we have the same 
policy as last year — I guess it was just more excite-ment about the lineup, ” Bramwell said..M[\Q^IT<QKSM\[;WTL7]\

“It’s up to the students to determine the 
details: whether they will give them away for free or if one will pay the o t h e r.”
This will be the first time the 
option to swap dining dollars has been available. At the end of the quarter, the HDH administration will review the program’s success and submit a report on possible improvements.
“Depending on that [report], we 
might alter the program to become more efficient, ” Ben Hassine said. 
She said changes include moving the 
transaction requests online or allowing students to report to HDH how many dining dollars they are looking to sell or buy — which would allow HDH to match up students for a purchase.
“There are a lot of options avail-
able, but at this point, the trial run just consists of two people coming in and signing the form for the transaction, ” Ben Hassine said.
She added, however, that the com-
mittee is concerned the program may have unintended negative results, such as students pressuring each other into selling their dining dollars.
“The way the pilot program will 
work initially is two parties will have to go in person to HDH office, ” Sandhu said. “Both parties would have to sign the form and there will be some form, of a brief screening with someone from HDH to make sure both students are willing to participate. ”
Committee members have also 
expressed concern that cash-strapped students may sell their dining dollars as a form of income, and consequently eat an insufficient amount. To prevent this, HDH plans to focus its advertis-ing for the program in markets such as Roger’s Place, targeting students who do not use meal points as their primary food source.
“We’ve decided not to do the mar-
keting in dining halls, just in the mar-ketplaces such as Earl’s and Goody’s, ” Ben Hassine said. “That way it’s more targeted marketing. ”
While the program will provide stu-
dents with more control, Muir College sophomore Stephanie Fairbairn said she is concerned that the plan does not solve the main problem: students being forced to purchase too many dining dollars to begin with — especially in light of the recent increase to manda-tory dining dollars, approved by the same committee on March 12.
“It sounds like a good idea if some-
one needs more dining dollar and oth-ers are willing to share or want to get 
reimbursed, ” Fairbairn, who currently has 200 dining dollars over the targeted amount, said. “It would still be better, though, if there was a choice of plans at the beginning of the year when students buy their dining dollars, so you don’t get stuck in this situation to begin with. ”
Still, the swap option is an improve-
ment, said Marshall College freshman Kirche Ray. 
“It’s definitely a good idea for stu-
dents to be able to sell them, ” Ray said. “That way, at the end of the year, people won’t have to buy unnecessary toasters and items just to try to get their money’s worth. ”

did not respond to requests for an interview.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta was 
among those left without a ticket, 
having been taken by surprise when they sold out so quickly.
“They sold out three weeks faster 
than last year, so it was pretty unex-pected, ” Gupta said. “It’s a good sign for the event — I think people are excited about Sun God this year. The A.S. president couldn’t even get a [guest] ticket to Sun God. ”
After guest tickets ran out unex-
pectedly on April 22, many students and nonstudents began to solicit tickets online, through sites like Facebook and Craigslist. Among the reimbursements offered on these sites are cash, alcohol and a place to crash on the day of the concert. Scalpers have already begun posting their extra tickets with prices as high as $90.
According to Bramwell, tracking 
down scalpers by tracing back tickets to their student ID numbers would be an impractical course of action for the UC Police Department, given the manpower and time required to track down individual offenders. 
“It’s a tricky situation, ” Bramwell 
said. “So, the best thing we are going to be doing is drafting cease-and-desist type ordinances on behalf of the university, and contacting scalp-ers individually  — telling them, essentially, to take their posting down. ”
Bramwell said that additional 
guest tickets might be made available on May 10, just before the festival.
“There’s a very small chance that 
a very small number may be on sale on May 10 — but it’s very unlikely at this point, and I don’t think it’s going to happen, personally, ” Bramwell said. “It’s better to give the warning that ‘Well, there’s a slight chance that it might happen, but don’t get your hopes up. ’ Don’t plan on it. ”
Those who do have guest tickets 
will have to trade them for wristbands on Thursday, May 13 or on the day of the festival in order to be admitted.

Senior Staff Writer“Students Against ASUCSD Anti-Israel Bias and Resolutions” — said the reso-lution is a pointed attack against Israel. 
“It’s a very thinly veiled political 
statement, ” Singer said. “If it’s about all human-rights violations, why are there a ton of citings specifically about Gaza and very few about anywhere else?”
Although Ghosh said 
the resolution has received endorsements from groups such as Jewish Voices for the Peace and that information in the resolution regarding com-panies profiting from occupancy was provided by the United Nations, Singer maintained that the draft is biased. 
“My main issue with 
this is that it’s very one-sided, ” Singer said. “It’s not hard to find news sourc-es that support your point of view. I can go on the Internet right now and find tons of sources that say that the Holocaust never happened. ”
She added that the resolution would 
be detrimental to relations between Israeli and Palestinian interest groups on campus.
“Say what you want about it — the 
intent is clear, ” she said. “The pro-Israel 
community has been try-ing really hard to build rela-tions with the pro-Palestine community, and we would never bring up a resolution against Hamas. ”
Tritons for Israel 
President Dafna Barzilay said it is not the council’s place to pass resolutions pertaining to international issues.
“We don’t support any 
such resolutions, even if it was pro-Israel or anti-Hamas, ” she said. “It’s not 
the business of A.S. to support interna-tional problems that require that scale of spending and is not directly related to the university. ”
In contrast, Ghosh said it is the 
council’s duty to be aware of global issues.
“If they believe that, why weren’t 
they there when we passed a resolution to support Haiti with allocations?” he asked. “Why weren’t they in the past, when we’ve been fighting for human rights in Sudan, fair trade in Africa?”
He said the resolution is meant to 
be a politically-neutral gesture. 
“It is not anti-Israel, ” he said. “Israel 
was very cleverly kept out of it. ”
Barzilay said that, regardless of past 
circumstances, it is doubtful the reso-lution will have any effect other than dividing the campus. 
“What will it do realistically?” she 
said. “I don’t think the regents will divest from these companies, and, in the grand scheme of things, I don’t think it will help create peace in any way. ”
The council will discuss the  passage 
of the resolution at their meeting this Wednesday, April 30, at 6 p.m. in the Price Center East forum.

This Time, They Went T oo FarAfter two years on campus 
without a car, I, like many before me, have developed 
an acute appreciation for life’s small-er pleasures: anything and every-thing off campus. 
During happier, more mobile 
times, I would never have thought that the stomach-turning texture of an over-microwaved Costco sample or the persistent stench of a crowded gas station could provoke a feel-ing of such freedom. None of us really knew, in happily signing that on-campus living agreement, that we were resigning ourselves to the kind of 10-week dorm entrapment and dining-hall overconsumption that could breed insanity in even the most zen of dorm dwellers. 
Last weekend, though, my sense 
of confinement reached new heights. 
After a Friday night that ended in 
barely succeeding to make macaroni and cheese with a good friend at 4 a.m. and promptly thereafter pass-ing out face down — mud still damp on the back of my pants (don’t ask) — we awoke the morning after with insufferable headaches, green rhine-stones plastered to our cheeks and a strong sense of purpose. 
At some uncertain point during 
a party in Hillcrest the night before, my friend had managed to rid her-self of both a brand-new iPhone and her keys (Lady Gaga, anyone?). While the phone ended up safely in the hands of another friend some-where in the Windansea area, her car keys nowhere to be found. Given our lack of vehicular mobility, options for recovery were limited. Just as we were preparing to concede our fates to the harrowing inefficiency of the Metropolitan Transit System, Flying the

67$7(1(:6 ³Ever since the California 
economy really started reeling in 2006, 
Port Triton has been flooding with listings for the most infamous of student jobs: the unpaid internship.  
However, the rise in unpaid internships 
— keeping penniless college students that much poorer during the four-year student-loan binge — recently caught the attention of federal regulators. According to officials in Oregon and California, companies are ignoring labor laws in offering these “opportunities. ” It’s about time someone stood up for 
us. And government investigation of the unpaid internship’s legality should only be the first step in revising employment laws so that student interns get paid for their labor. Especially those putting themselves through college, who can’t afford to sacri-fice 40 work hours a week for a bullet point on their resume. 
Until now, the six criteria legalizing the 
unpaid intern — established in 1947 — have served more as loose-fitting guidelines open to the employer’s interpretation than solid, unbendable principles. Because the 
criterion that the unpaid intern must ben-
efit more from the employer than vice versa is vague, an employer who forces a student to stuff envelopes all summer in exchange for a glowing letter of recommendation can still get off scot-free. 
But in rewriting this legislation more

As a borderline obsessive “South Park” fan, I can recognize when 
creators Stone and Parker have pushed the boundaries past 
their best interests.
The dynamic duo have forged their way as two stoner geniuses 
who bulge the envelope like nobody’s business — but neither can continue happily offending old ladies and religious institutions with flamethrowers like these pointed their direction.
After episode “200, ” CNN aired an interview with Yunus 
Muhammad, a member of Islamic fundamentalist group Revolution Muslim, who called upon all Muslims to “terrorize” Parker and Stone. Even though the interviewee claimed there was a distinction between “terrorize” and “kill, ” Comedy Central was wise not to ignore that warning — and not only because their creative powerhouse was 
threatened. There comes a point at which comedy has to take a back-
seat to cultural sensitivity, and that point has officially been reached.
On April 23, after Revolution Muslim posters declared they 
“knew where to find” the producers, Comedy Central asked the NYPD to step up security at their central office in New Y ork.
When the censored version of episode “201” aired, many fans were 
upset — and they became livid when Comedy Central refused to post the uncensored version online. However, while there are few things more annoying than an episode’s wrap-up speech being replaced with a four-minute bleep, Comedy Central did have the bigger picture in 
mind: prioritizing the show’s future (not to mention the lives of its 
creators) over the First Amendment rights of a single episode.
—Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion EditorSouth Park” creators Stone and Parker haven always, rather successfully, aimed to outrage a sizable portion of the 
population with every episode. Followers of Islam couldn’t really have expected the show’s characters to spare them — especially since this is not Muhammad’s first guest appear-ance on “South Park. ” 
Similarly, Buddha and Jesus have run the “South Park” 
gauntlet and emerged uncensored. Islamic group Muslim Revolution’s overreaction to Muhammad’s appearance in the newer installments of the satire could be expected, but produc-ers should have taken the high road; that’s precisely the kind 
of controversial content that’s allowed their show to 
become so popular. What’s most disturbing is not 
the religious upset but Comedy Central’s will-
ingness to bow to lukewarm threats posted 
online. 
Stone and Parker’s “everyone gets 
theirs” concept hinges on the demoral-
ization of various groups in a humor-
ous manner; if more groups con-
tinue to demand special treatment, 
“South Park” won’t be the only show to sacrifice its anything-
goes autonomy to a few pissed-off 
viewers.
—Neda Salamat
Senior Staff WriterComedy Central censored the April 21 episode of “South 
Park” after a radical Muslim group threatened to kill 
show producers Trey Parker and Matt Stone for insulting Muhammad in the previous episode. 
The censoring of references to the Muslim prophet has 
sparked a nationwide discussion centered around religious respect and free speech. What’s most surprising, though, is that nothing like this has gone down before in the show’s 13-year history. 
When it premiered in 1997, “South Park” instantly became 
the show that went too far. Episode “200” wasn’t even the first time the “South Park” producers have featured Muhammad on their show. In 2001’s “Super Best Friends, ” Muhammad made his debut as a turban-clad Arab next to the founders of other religions, including Krishna and Joseph Smith.
Wednesday’s episode took it even further 
— but bottling offensive humor never made anyone stop laughing. Censoring episode “201” in response to a threat is probably 
the most ironic thing Comedy Central 
could have done. Looks like network officials didn’t get the signature “South Park” hint: Free speech will always out-shout fear and intimidation.

GET YOURS.THE RIVETER By Ronnie Steinitz
though, we were struck by bril-
liance: With my roommate’s ZipCar account at my disposal, we’ d surely be able to book it to Windansea, Hillcrest and back to campus in the span of a single hour — my forgetful friend returning with car keys and a renewed sense of personal dignity. 
The ridiculousness that resulted 
bore little resemblance to my inge-nious plan. Evidently, we weren’t the only ones itching to flee campus on a Saturday afternoon, as each of the four designated ZipCar parking spots were empty for the duration of our two-hour search. 
After spending half the afternoon 
circling campus in a golf cart and matching sweatshirts, calling out the occasional campus tour guide on his dirty, vicious lies about UCSD, our vain search for a vacant ZipCar concluded. I took out a $20 from the ATM downstairs for her bus fare, we hustled to Gilman and Myers just as MTS Bus Route 30 was about to depart, and she was on her merry way out into civilization. 
What struck me most about the 
whole ordeal, though, wasn’t so much my bitterness toward the car-sharing program, nor toward what-ever cruel, selfish souls prioritized taking a ZipCar for a Costco joyride over my friend’s well-being. No, the whole episode reminded me most of what is probably my least favorite thing about this school: Without the aid of motorized transport, an on-campus dweller’s greatest expo-sure to the outside world comes in the form of a $2 burger from Price Center. Or a Jamba Juice — which, as of press time, doesn’t even have a two-for-one promotion anymore. Great.
This dire state of affairs will 
probably only worsen come fall, when the Parking & Transportation Services department will be forced to cut campus shuttle lines and/or bus-line subsidies. In the meantime, I think I’ll start handcuffing my friends’ keys to their wrists when we go out together. It’s a long, cold walk back down to the bus stop.
Stuck on Campus, There’s No Thrill Like a $2 Burger
▶ END, IURPSDJHDear Editor,
The Resolution in Support of 
Peace and Neutrality Through UC Divestment from U.S. Corporations Profiting From Occupation seems to be a divisive issue, one that will polarize the community and the A.S. Council. Most, if not all, people will agree that the conflict is a con-tentious issue — one not too many people want to get involved with. 
However, as a Jewish student who 
supports human rights and peace, I strongly urge all voting members of the council to vote in support of this, because doing so is the best and most logical course of action. It allows one to take a strong, neutral stance in regards to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict — while promoting equality, the securing of human rights for all, justice and adherence to international law. 
Voting ‘Y es’ on the resolution 
clearly conveys one’s desire to not support violence on either side of the conflict, and affirms the fact that one wants nothing more to do with this decades-long conflict. However, vot-ing ‘No’ essentially declares that one is taking a side in the conflict, and is a willing, indirect participant in the perpetuation of the injustices being carried out by an exclusive side. 
This resolution only helps to ele-
vate the level of respect for humanity and equality of all people — regard-less of race, ethnicity, religious affili-ation, gender and sexual orientation. Furthermore, in the 60-plus years of the conflict, this resolution is the first solution of its kind that is nonviolent and does not target any specific eth-nic group, but rather a government’s policies that create injustice. 
This is the A.S. Council’s chance 
to not only be a courageous defender of human rights and equality, but also be part of the movement that is seeking to end the perpetuation of conflicts in the most neutral way.

Students Must Fight for a Level Playing Field
for companies to deny when com-
pensation is legally deserved.
Until then, cracking the whip on 
exploitative employers will remain a student task. Especially given that Career Services Center employees  tend to skirt the obtrusive elephant in the room when offering students career opportunities.
While we wait for the slow-
moving cogs of bureaucracy to turn, the UCSD Career Services Center should take this opportunity to ensure that the internships adver-tised on Port Triton offer more to UCSD students than daily coffee runs for the company’s head hon-cho. 
Approximately half the college 
students who have held unpaid internships could testify that their employers didn’t play by the rules — at least, that’s what federal Labor Department regulators estimate, though they admit it’s difficult to uncover which particular corpora-tions cheat their respective interns out of a salary, as interns are often fearful of filing complaints.
The internship evaluations 
posted on the Career Services Center website, however, provide a decent outlet for those students who wish to air their grievances against employers with the luxury of ano-nymity. 
One student, who did an unpaid 
internship for the locally-based Virtual Reality Medical Center, complained that he accepted the job offer under the guise of gaining edit-ing experience, though — surprise, surprise — the position mostly just involved doing an editorial assis-tant’s grunt work.
And it’s not just the crisp pay-
check student workers are missing out on — it’s also legal protection against sexual harassment in the workplace, afforded exclusively to official employees. Although employment laws don’t apply to interns, the UCSD Academic Internship Program should inves-tigate which companies have had employee-rights problems in the past, and focus on directing stu-dents toward proven internships that provide a safe academic envi-ronment. 
Internship Coordinator at the 
Career Services Center Christy Quiogue claims that all students — 
regardless of background — are on a level play-ing field. But when the CSC’s most concrete effort to ensure this equal-ity is merely advising students to research the internships that interest them, to make sure intern evaluations from past stu-
dents align with their career goals, Quiogue’s is a dubious claim. 
This approach fails to address the 
idea that more financially strained students may not have the luxury of adding unpaid internships to their resumes next to the part-time job that actually pay their bills. 
To make matters worse, in most 
cases students are required to accept college credit through AIP . While school credit might seem like a nice consolation prize for free labor, it comes at a hefty cost: AIP requires that students pay tuition for every college credit they receive. 
At $229 per unit and a minimum 
of four units per internship, stu-dents end up paying the university at least $916 for their free labor. So, 
if you have to work for free, then — congrats — you will succeed in the post-graduation job hunt. If not, better luck next time.
Of course, there are the strong, 
competitive few — well-off enough to go without a salary for a summer — who swear the unpaid intern-ship is worth the work in the long run. But it’s not fair that the current system accommodates rich kids with trust funds, while those from lower-income families are forced to forgo a professional opportunity for a paying job. This is where federal law can come into play to ensure students aren’t being abused for free labor.
It seems daunting for the lat-
ter group of students to speak out against unequal opportunity, but filing an educated complaint is the only way to change a company’s policy. Oregon state regulators, for one, have recently been attending to grievances from student employees, offering them back pay for their unpaid work. 
Because California is among the 
top states in violation of these laws, along with Oregon and New Y ork, it is now our own prerogative to call attention to a sketchy system, even if it means giving up the chance for a radiant employer evaluation.
The federal government needs to 
revise and tighten its labor laws to spell out who must be paid for what, leaving no room for dispute. In the meantime, we the unpaid interns should inform ourselves on our own exploitation. In the end, it will help interns — particularly those who are underprivileged — to earn some deserved leverage with employers and boost their chances of post-graduation success.

Take the La Jolla Village Drive exit off the Interstate 
805 and you’ll enter the shadow of a colony of white-
and-beige high-rises. This is La Jolla Crossroads: home of three sparkling pools, a stacked gym, a home theater and private tanning booth.
First, and least importantly, the 
elevators are possessed. If they’re not opening and closing their doors for no reason, they’re beep-ing incessantly on the ground level. Then there’s the fact that the walls separating each apartment from the next are paper-thin- meaning you’ve got an all-access auditory pass to your neighbors’ shout matches, porn-star sex moans and deafening surround sound. Lastly, Crossroads is policed by Summit Patrol — a bunch of bored-looking Carl Winslow types, ready to write you up for using your dishwasher past 10 p.m.
Bottom line: If you’re willing to shell out the big bucks 
(around $550 to share a room and $1,100 for a single) to wake up to a gorgeously lit, devastatingly modern apart-
ment, Crossroads is probably the place for you — just be 
prepared to invest in a solid pair of earplugs. And, by all 
means, take the stairs.

Noise is mini-mal: Even the sorority girls next door can’t throw a rager loud enough to pierce through the thick walls. Located less than a mile from the Regents parking lot, Eastgate mall is in a position to let you to bike, walk or shuttle to campus.

La Regencia is an ongo-ing set of compromises perfectly suited for col-lege students. Rooms are decent enough and rent is low- around $425 to share a room and $650 for a single-, though 3 a.m. fire-
alarm wakeups every month or two can be a hefty price to pay. 
Its location alongside the Arriba Shuttle and Vons means it’ll 
only take a quick two-minute stroll to catch the bus or pick up 
whatever amenities you may desire — including the Raid you’ll need to fend off the armies of ants that will parade through your home every time it rains. But did I mention rent? Cheap as dirt.

VERANO AT COLONY
Verano is the assembly-line version of some ambitious turn-of-the-century city planner’s vision for the ideal suburban living space: a mazelike series of two-story earth-tone condos arranged in lopsided concentric circles, lined with papery white trees and dotted at random with patches of fenced-off lawn that miraculously stay green all year.
 Like most near-identical complexes that consume the sur-
rounding area, a single room at this sub-ritzy prefab villa runs anywhere from $900 to $1,100. Or you can cut that in half 
by bunking up with another brave soul unwilling to conquer condoland. Nightlife in the University City neighborhood is nonexistent, but consider that motivation to get creative for Facebook invitations to all those Popov-fueled dance parties 
you’ve been waiting to throw. And, with the Arriba Shuttle 
rolling by your window every 12 minutes, a quick trip to Porter’s is just a 30-second flight down the Verano stairwell.

Adouble-layered circle on the edges of the world’s most manicured dog park, La Jolla Colony offers options from high-rise hives (La

Its biggest perks are a five- to 10-minute proxim-
ity to the first and second stops on the Arriba Shuttle, along with slightly lower rent than complexes closer to the first stop (the Venetian, Trieste, La Scala). Of course, living next to Vons and half of UCSD’s off-
campus population doesn’t hurt either.

If you’re thinking of renting at Costa Verde, you have only one 
logical reason: location. There isn’t a single residence in this mon-
strous complex that requires more than a 30-second walk to a UCSD Arriba Shuttle stop or a diminutive 10-minute stroll to campus itself. When residents are asked to pay $1,700 for a two-bedroom apart-ment, it’s no wonder the vast majority of residents are classmates. 
Unfortunately, the best way to take advantage of the shuttle stops 
is to bypass morning shuttles and sleep until noon — anything before 11 a.m. is packed. Once you take away the short trek to campus, you’ve got a management office that doesn’t care whether you have to sell a kidney to pay off your all your neighborhood parking tickets, the slowest elevators since the Titanic and a water bill that’s deter-mined by how many cold showers the creeper down the hall takes per day. There’s also a McDonald’s next door for the occasional late-night study snack, but after seeing one too many public-service fliers on the 
latest runaway groper, an evening out might not be worth the fries.

Nestled between a luxury retirement home and 
several quaint condos, it’s no surprise that 
Trieste — in all its gray-beige glory — doesn’t exactly stand out. The nondescript complex is uncomfort-ably reminiscent of Warren College apartments, fre-quently subject to parking-space stealers and mainte-nance crews who take weeks to fix a broken gate. It’s also a challenge to decorate the rooms due to their odd polygonal walls.  But, despite all its faults, Trieste is fairly pricey, running upwards of $1,700 for a one bedroom/one loft apartment.
On the up side, if you plan on cooking a lot, the 
furnished kitchen is a paradise of granite countertops and electric stoves. Campus proximity is also ideal: you won’t spend more than 10 minutes on the UCSD Arriba or Nobel Shuttles. Even better, Vons and Ralphs are a quick ride away — just catch an MTS 
bus on either Nobel Drive or La Jolla Village Drive.

In fact, many stu-dents will sacrifice a small slice of their souls in an icy Costa Verde compartment just so they can minimize the commute, but the Playmor apartments prove you need not commit to a year of prison-like banality just to save gas money. Tucked into a bright suburban side-street, the ’70s-era dwellings are just a 15-minute walk (or a five-minute bike ride) from the always-speedy Regents Parking Lot shuttle. Each apartment in the cluster is owned sepa-rately, so — depending on how well you can charm your landlord — rent (and decorating liberties) will vary. By paying around $650 a month for a single, you earn the right to poke tack-holes into almost every wall; my four male roommates broke the screen door and spilled beer/blood on the

Dwarfed by newer, expansive complexes like 
The Venetian Apartments and Regents Court, 
the diminutive Pines of La Jolla complex is easy to miss. In a gated cluster of vine-covered three-story buildings, Pines offers mostly two-bedroom units. Its tree-lined paths are accented by the pleasant sound 
of running water — courtesy of several fountains 
sprinkled throughout the complex’s lawns. There’s also a sweet pool and a private Jacuzzi. Its close proximity to the first Arriba Shuttle stop makes the modest complex one of the more comfortable living situations in the area, though a large population of young professionals and senior citizens also inhabit this serene zen garden, and don’t take kindly to bitchin’ ragers.

Located a mere 15-minute walk from campus off Gilman Drive — or a five-minute ride on the MTS Bus Route 202, if you’re feeling exceptionally lazy 
— the Villa La Jolla apartments are prime for those who prioritize an unen-cumbered way to get to school and easy access to Ralphs. Villa La Jolla may also be the cheapest place to live within spitting distance of campus. Seriously, this complex is absolutely empty—the landlords desperately need residents, so make sure to ask for $200 minimum off your rent.
Otherwise, Villa La Jolla is pretty run-of-the-mill. It’s got the standard pool, 
spa, laundry room and easily pilfered internet. There is, however, one issue — the walls are so thin, your neighbors might as well be in the same room.

University City
RNC[OQTLiving in downtown La Jolla is the piece of 
paradise you might expect: the ocean breeze in your backyard, a hot bevy of scantily clad 
beach babes strolling by and a lifetime supply of frozen yogurt. But don’t make the mistake of believing the neighborhood was made for the young and reckless — they’re mostly the rich and the retired. If a meaning-of-life monologue from old Auntie Em across the street doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, then don’t even bother making friends with the neighbors. 
Apartment complexes in the area ask for a mini-
mum of $700 per month, but assuming you’re up for the challenge (and who isn’t, for a place near the fuck-ing beach?), then welcome to heaven. The MTS Bus Route 30 stop is right around the corner, and from there, it’s a scenic 15-minute hop to campus. The way back is even better: No amount of stress can overcome the satisfaction of arriving home. Life is good.
ȅCTVGFKVQTNCLQNNCUJQTGU YKPFCPUGC
Scoring a spot on La Jolla’s prime stretch of paradise is no small feat, especially as the city continues to demolish the few shabby apartments left to make 
room for luxury condos. Unless you shit money, you either have to work as a live-in catsitter for some hospitalized bil-lionaire or convince the landlord your behavior mimics that of a nun to snatch a room that’s upward of $750.
Whatever the forces you’re working against, if you can 
find a way to live walking distance from the prettiest beach in San Diego, you will be a happier person. On the weekends, you can whet your whistle at The Shack then stumble across the street for a burrito at Rigoberto’s, the neighborhood’s infa-mous 24-hour Mexican eatery. The tipsy walk home against the smelly sea air will get you wondering: Why ever leave?
But if you really need to, like, go to school or something, 
you can catch a bus at one of the MTS Route 30 stops along La Jolla Boulevard for a 25-minute trip back to reality. Just be sure to hurry home before sunset — each one is some-thing out of a dream.

Ocean Beach
Across-hatch of hip-
sters, grad students and the occasional 
professor, Hillcrest is a slice of what college should be — filled with more trendy coffee shops (Cafe Bassam) and thrift stores (Frock Y ou, Flashbacks) than University City has highrises.
As for nightlife, Hillcrest is home to a few quaint dive 
bars, but the real party’s always at one of the area’s many crackin’ gay clubs. Try the Brass Rail for cheap drinks, and the Gossip Grill for ladies of every persuasion.
Not as crowded or bourgie as downtown, Hillcrest 
is small enough to navigate on bicycle or foot. If you’re looking to go green and save gas, the commute is made simple by a UCSD Shuttle that stops at the UCSD Medical Center in Hillcrest, where staff and students can hop on for a free ride every 30 minutes. However, afford-able housing can be hard to find; be prepared to scour Craigslist for weeks, and save your money in the mean-
time — rooms can cost upward of $700 a month.

Sorrento Valley
One exit north of Genessee sits the sleepy 
commercial town of Sorrento Valley, a business district with polar virtues and 
vices when it comes to housing. If you’ve got plans to move here, be prepared to sacrifice everything glorious about being young and unemployed.
Sorrento Valley is mainly inhabited by corpo-
rate tycoon-headquarters like Texas Instruments and Qualcomm, as well as small-timers like University Readers. But in between the office buildings, you might spot some livable apartments complexes like Wateridge or Archstone Torrey Hill (offering around $700 for a single) — most of which are a five-minute drive from the nearest gro-cery stores and late-night drive-thrus. It’ll be a little longer to drive to campus though. 
Needless to say, it’s all about your priorities. If 
you’re looking to land a larger apartment and focus on your studies next year, then Sorrento Valley’s got you covered.

ClairemontWhen it comes time to unwind in the night-time, Clairemont has 
little more to offer than late night runs to Cotixan. Just south of University City, the quiet, child- and meth-den-friendly neighbor-hood is kind of a downer for the college crowd. But as long as you have a car, you can escape the labyrinth of shoddy little boxes for a trip downtown in 15 minutes or to Pacific Beach in 10, with no RSOs, gridlock traffic or drunk bitches puking on your doorstep. 
Rent in Clairemont is more than reasonable: Y ou can score your own room in a spacious 
house for about $600. The quiet neighborhood is also home to a few restaurants — although most of them are grocery chains and generic franchises like Target. If you’re skimping on a parking pass to save some cash (or the planet), city buses can get you to campus — but unless you’ve got the foresight to catch it an hour in advance, the bumbling MTS Bus 41 will likely result in an awkwardly late arrival.

Asunny patch of adorable cafes and authentically sketchy dive bars about 15 miles southeast of campus, University Heights is the ideal incubator for UCSD’s fringe population of hipster hopefuls. Sure, getting there is annoying 
as all hell — either braving the everlasting traffic on Interstate 5 or biking your trendy ass to the Hillcrest Medical Center shuttle stop — but that’s half the appeal. 
See, living in University Heights will test your commitment to an anti-UCSD 
subculture lifestyle of decorating a quaint ’50s home, frequenting cramped, seedy drinking holes and living such an unreasonable distance from campus that only your closest (and coolest) friends will visit. 
Upsides include cheap rent, delicious eats (try El Zarape and Pomegranate) and 
local hangouts within biking distance. (Hit up Twiggs for quiet reading and Lancers for cheap drinks). The closer you live to Park Boulevard, the better. Y ours truly tore herself from the Heights after a two-month summer holiday because she couldn’t han-dle the commute, but who knows — maybe you’re indie enough to last the entire year.

University Heights
Pacific Beach
While the picturesque hills of La Jolla cater to a slightly more geriatric demographic, Pacific Beach is a bar-packed alternative for San Diego’s beach bums and twentysomethings. If you don’t want to be woken in 
the wee hours by Jäger-fueled frat boys and blacked-out skinny bitches, you should find a place at least three blocks from the main Garnet Street drag (for around $750 a month). Don’t worry. Everything cool in PB is a quick walk or bike ride away. 
Hit up Henry’s for the best deal on produce this side of the border, and Trader 
Joe’s for cheese, tea and wine. Nighttime hotspots range from dingy dives like the 
Nite Owl to classy cocktail bars like Bar West. Shopping on the strip is good, 
too. Lodged between liquor stores, smoke shops and tattoo parlors are thrift 
stores of the $3 rummage-bin sort, alongside pricier consignment varieties 
like Buffalo Exchange.
PB is the best place in town to satiate your row-
diest urges to rage once I-House parties have lost 
their charm. The only requirement: a car, or at 
least a friend who won’t mind trekking back and 
forth along the I-5 for the next nine months.
ȅYGDGFKVQTIf you’re looking for an easy trip to campus, Ocean Beach isn’t for you. Public transporta-tion can only take you downtown — very 
slowly — and your Free Bus Zone sticker is worth-less on OB routes. But a bumper-to-bumper com-mute down Interstate 5 is easily offset by OB’s tight-knit community of boho surf bums and bar-fly semi-babes with an eye for your engineering degree. 
The housing scene is a quick remedy for com-
muter remorse: Singles go for $600 to $800 in a two-bedroom apartment, just blocks from the beach. The OB People’s Co-op and a weekly Wednesday farmers’ market are the neighborhood’s alternatives to Ralphs. But beware: if you stay in OB too long, it’s easy to forget about the rest of San Diego, especially now that OB is undergoing a nightlife overhaul. South Beach Bar and Grill, home of San Diego’s best fish tacos, is adding a second floor to it’s beachside location, Pizza Port just opened a microbrewery. However, not everyone in town has evolved from the “Footloose” era: Pac Shores’ bar bouncers will still boot even the cutest of whiskey-eyed Guardian  editors for dancing.

<eh7fh_bEDBOCkijfh[i[djYekfedSTUDENT SPECIAL - APRIL 2010viously lost three out of four games 
at the Santa Clara Invitational in mid-April.
“We obviously wanted 
to win against Chapman because it was a confer-ence game and because it was Senior Night, ” Bocian said. “But I don’t think the win really changed anything. ”
Senior util-
ity Stephanie Heinrich scored within the first minute of the match. UCSD went on to score 10 unanswered goals over most of three quar-ters, before Chapman answered with a lone goal at the end of the third period. Redshirt fresh-man goalkeeper Allie Taylor replaced Quane entering the final period, shutting out the Panthers to seal the 15-1 Triton victory.
Heinrich led all 
scoring with three goals. Junior attacker Hanalei Crowell, fresh-man attacker Audrey Mitchell and junior util-ity Kelsey Schultz added two apiece.
Ten different Tritons 
scored in the match, including all of the team’s seniors who par-ticipated.
“I enjoyed playing 
with all the seniors, ” Bocian said. “ All of us started, which doesn’t normally happen. It gave us a chance to 
reflect on our last four years, because it’s the last time all of us will really get to play together like that. ”
As the No. 2 seed — an improve-
ment from last year’s No. 4 spot — the Tritons have a bye in the first round of the WWPA Championships.
They will face the winner of the 
showdown between No. 7 Sonoma State and No. 10 Chapman at 3:40 p.m. on April 30. LMU will face the winner of the No. 8 CSU San Bernardino matchup and No. 9 CSU Monterey Bay at 5 p.m. 
The Tritons finished their regu-
lar season with an overall record of 16-18, which included a seven-game win streak from March 27 to April 9. LMU finished at 24-4, a program best.

SENIOR UTILITY,
WOMEN’S WATER POLO▶ W. WATER POLO, MYVTWHNLAfter Egypt’s failure to qualify, 
Nigeria currently stands second only 
to Cameroon in the FIFA rankings of the African nations to qualify for the World Cup. Nigeria will be a case study of sorts, providing a measure for how much “home con-tinent” advantage boosts a squad’s tournament fate. The “Super Eagles” have some quality attacking options with Obafemi Martins, Y akubu and two-time African Player of the Y ear Nwankwo Kanu leading the frontline. Joseph Y obo and Taye Taiwo will anchor the defense, and Chelsea’s John Obi Mikel has proven himself to be a strong holding midfielder at the highest level. 
With virtually every one of its 
players based in the world’s top leagues, Nigeria seems ready for the high level of competition it will face in South Africa. However, the team did crash out of the 2002 cup, and failed to qualify in 2006. Consequently, Nigeria’s chances of rising from the group stages are far from certain. Nevertheless, the team should emerge as a runner-up if its players can keep their nerve on the world’s biggest stage.
Only eight years after their 
shocking fourth place finish, South Korea has proven that it should not be overlooked. World powerhouses Portugal, Italy and Spain learned that lesson the hard way in 2002, when each lost to the co-hosts of the tournament. Now led by native Huh Jung-Moo, South Korea will look to repeat that upset and build on a hugely successful qualifying cam-paign that saw them go unbeaten and become top qualifiers out of Asia. Captained by Manchester United winger Park Ji-Sung, the squad is certainly not without talent, with a speedy attack led by Park and Bolton forward Lee Chung-Y ong. 
Y et with the majority of the 
squad playing in South Korean and Japanese clubs, much of the team is untested against the world’s top talent. South Korea will certainly give each of its opponents in South Africa a difficult match, and making it beyond of the group stages is not out of the question. However, with a majority of the South Korean play-ers based in leagues that don’t rank among the world’s best, the team might narrowly miss the opportunity to advance in this year’s tournament.
Like South Korea, Greece has 
had recent unexpected international success that it will aim to build upon in South Africa. After an astonish-ing victory over Portugal, Greece emerged as the Euro 2004 champion, marking the team’s most successful finish ever in an international tour-nament. The Greeks also boast nota-ble international talent: Liverpool defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos will lead the back line, and Celtic striker Georgios Samaras is expected to pro-vide the goals. 
However, a majority of the squad 
plays for Greek clubs, and will have to elevate their game considerably in South Africa. In addition, this is only Greece’s second time qualifying for the World Cup, as a 1994 appearance ended after three straight losses. A nation deep in financial trouble, Greece could certainly benefit from a successful showing in South Africa; still, it will take a substantial effort and perhaps a bit of luck for the Greeks to move past the group stages. 
Group B should be a dogfight — 
easy games will be hard to come by. Look for South Korea and Nigeria to stay close on points, with the final game in the group stages deciding who advances.

and want to tell me what it was like? Do you think Park Ji-Sung was a more-than-adequate replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo? Write me at lfrose@ucsd.edu.

With less than two months 
until the 2010 FIFA World Cup — perhaps 
the most conflict-transcending event in the world — kicks off in South Africa, I will assess the chances of the four hopefuls in Group B: Argentina, Nigeria, Greece and South Korea.
With an overload of talent that 
includes Lionel Messi, arguably the world’s best player, Argentina would seem a safe bet to get out 
of the group stages. Y et it should 
not be overlooked that just seven months ago, the team was in seri-ous danger of failing to even make it to South Africa after three straight losses; the sanity of manager Diego Maradona even fell into question. The Argentines lost five of seven qualifying matches from October 2008 to September 2009, and only a last-gasp Martin Palermo goal in the final qualifying match against Uruguay punched their ticket to South Africa. 
Afterward, Maradona found it 
necessary to prove god had noth-ing to do with what came out of his mouth — in contrast to the divine intervention of his 1986 “hand of god” goal — saying, “Those who did not believe ... let them suck my dick, and keep on sucking it. ” 
While Maradona didn’t really 
prove anybody wrong by running Argentina’s worst qualifying cam-paign in recent history, his team did come together when it really mat-tered — a quality that could bode well for their fate in South Africa. He may have driven away Juan Roman Riquelme, one of the country’s top midfielders, but his attacking options are still second to none, with the likes of Messi, Carlos Tevéz, Gonzalo Higuaín, Diego Milito and Sergio Agüero to back him up. An older defense may not be as world-class as the strikers, but experience in high-pressure international matches is often underestimated. Qualification in South America is never easy, and despite Argentina’s struggles, it is still very capable of a deep tournament run, and should emerge as the win-ner of Group B. The Rose

Triton Invitational

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — After finishing 
the regular season with a conference record of 8-2, UCSD will now enter the Western Water Polo Association Championships as the No. 2 seed. 
Standing in their way is top-seeded Loyola 
Marymount, which boasts a perfect 8-0 confer-ence record and beat the Tritons in their only matchup this season by a score of 10-4 on Feb. 
20. Since that time, the Tritons have risen in the 
polls from unranked to No. 18 in the nation — while LMU has remained steady at No. 8.
“Our team goal is to win WWPAs, ” senior 
utility Stephanie Bocian said. “Our first game is this Friday against Sonoma State, and we try to take it one game at a time. Since all these games are very important, we try not to overlook any competitors. Our hopes are to play LMU in the conference championships and win, but we haven’t talked about LMU directly. ”
The Tritons closed out their regular sea-
son with mixed results, routing Chapman 
University 15-1 on April 16 before falling to 
San Diego State 11-3 at the annual Harper Classic on April 23. The two matches were the team’s final home games of the season, as they prepared to travel to CSU Bakersfield for the WWPA Championships from April 30 to May 2. 
On April 16, No. 13 SDSU maintained its 
dominance over the Tritons, winning its 10th straight Harper Classic to remain a perfect 
10-0 in the annual cross-town matchup. SDSU 
scored early and often, netting the first four goals of the game before senior Triton attacker Audra Bloom put UCSD on the board with 4:23 left to play in the first half. 
UCSD didn’t score again until the fourth 
quarter, by which time the Aztecs had convert-ed six goals to take a commanding 10-2 lead. Bloom and sophomore attacker Jessica Tran scored twice for the Tritons in the loss.
“That was a rough game that was not 
expected at all, ” Bocian said. “Most of us felt pretty prepared for the game, but it didn’t show 
when we played... We want to move on from 
that game and not really think about it. It’s kind of embarrassing on our part. We’re mov-ing forward and are very concentrated on the WWPAs, which is what ultimately matters the most. ”
A week earlier, the Tritons saw a much 
different outcome at home against Chapman. Backed by a strong outing from senior goal-keeper Markayla Quane on Senior Night, the 
Triton offense attacked the Panthers with a 
steady onslaught of scoring. The win was a significant leap for the Tritons, who had pre-

Facing Division-I competitors, interna-tional athletes and even an Olympic gold medalist, the Tritons held their own — and proved they belong among 
such stellar company — at the UCSD Triton Invitational on April 24.
“The competition here is definitely higher 
than at conferences, ” head coach Tony Salerno said. “ And, in some cases, it’s higher than at nationals. To be a winner here is pretty special. ”
Former Olympic gold medalist Félix Sánchez 
— who won the Dominican Republic’s first-ever gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 2004 Athens games — competed in the 400-meter dash on Saturday. Sánchez, a graduate of nearby University City High School, grew up in the La Jolla Colony apartments behind Doyle Park, though he has represented his country of heritage since 1999. He last competed in the Triton Invite 12 years ago as a member of Mesa Community College; this time however, he competed as one of the world’s most accomplished hurdlers, and easily ran away with the race. Sánchez posted a time of 45.99 seconds. 
The Olympian’s presence exemplifies the level 
of competition attracted to the Triton Invitational: Schools stream in from across the country, and individual athletes come from around the world. Laura Turner, who represented Great Britain at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was also present, and took both the 100- and 200-meter races. The Triton athletes also proved they belonged.
Senior Christine Merrill won two events, 
senior Kelly Fogarty forged a new school record and four other Tritons earned hard-fought victo-ries at a star-studded home meet. Junior Theresa Richards and senior Leon Baham posted top-five marks in Division-II with their wins, while junior Caprice Thompson and senior Linda Rainwater also notched victories in their respective events. 
Fogarty finished third in the 100, and took a 
close second in the 200. Fogarty was already the school record holder in the 100, and a time of 24.09 seconds in the 200 gave her the record in that event as well. 
While it is not uncommon for Merrill to win 
multiple events at a meet, doing so at an elite invitational was especially head-turning. Merrill came up victorious in the 100- and 400-meter hurdles, holding off UCLA ’s Ryann Krais in both events.
Theresa Richards joined the ranks with a 
victory in the javelin throw, setting a personal best by over 10 feet with a mark of 149’9” — just enough to edge out University of Kansas thrower Heather Bergmann’s distance of 149’4” . Richards’ distance was the fifth best in Division-II this sea-son. Holly Kane from the University of Tennessee finished third.
The University of Tennessee’s Matt Maloney 
dominated the men’s javelin event with his throw of 230’11” . It was one of the top 10 in all of NCAA 
so far this season, beating out UCSD’s sophomore Nick Howe’s effort by nearly 20 feet.  
Baham’s win came in the 400-meter hurdles, 
when he tied for first with Mesa College’s Clark Coyle at 52.18 seconds. Though Baham came down the home stretch with the lead, he  clipped a hurdle along the way, allowing Coyle to catch up. But Baham finished strong and did not sur-render the lead, allowing the two athletes to share the victory — not even a photo finish could not determine a winner. Baham’s time is the fifth fastest in Division-II this season, and third best in UCSD history. 
“It’s exciting, ” Baham said. “When you run 
with faster guys you run faster. Its always a chal-lenge and I welcome it. ”
Rainwater won the high jump with a mark of 
5’10” , while Thompson came out with a victory in the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of 11:27.20 — the fourth best in school history. 
“Our athletes see a high level of competition 
— Division-I level and above — throughout the year, ” said Salerno. “When they get to Division-II national they feel very comfortable, and they know they are deserving to win. ”
The Tritons have two weeks to prepare for 
the CCAA Championships, which will be held at UCSD starting May 6.
