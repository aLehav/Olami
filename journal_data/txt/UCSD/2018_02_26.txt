A committee is examinin g
the re gulations of the
farmers‚Äô market and concerns 
from Price Center ven dors.
This past wee k, the Retai l
Committee, a coa lition o f UC San 
Diego representatives and Price
Center ven dors held its first meetin g 
of the year to discuss enforcement o f 
regulatory changes to t he farmers‚Äô 
market. Thi s is after the recent 
discover y of improper oi l disposa l 
by uni dentified ven dors from t he 
farmers‚Äô mar ket an d concerns raise d
by Price Center businesses on the
discre pancies between t heir own 
contractua l limitations wit h UCS D
and the agreements wit h the wee kly 
vendors. The possibilit y of relocation 
and more rigorous environmenta l
guidelines are amon g the issues t hat
will continue to be debated  at futu re
meetin gs.
The meetin g primari ly focuse d 
on t he extent o f the universit y‚Äôs
oversi ght of the farmers‚Äô mar ket an d
lack thereo f. A key determinant to 
the discuss ion was the fact that there
have been no forma l agreements o f 
memorandums of understandin g 
between t he universit y an d the 
market ven dors in t he past. T he
primar y concerns brought up by 
Price Center ven dors w ho are un der
contract is that the market offers 
simi lar food options, so t hey‚Äôre
worried it will affect  their sales.  
The commi ttee served as a
platform to provide ven dors, UC
officials, an d stu dents wit h the 
opportun it y  t o  o p e n  a n  o n g o ing

California universities were pro hibited from having the ma jor in 1961 in or der to focus teac hers‚Äô e ducations on t he content itse lf.CLASSES
UC San Diego is in the process o f 
intro ducin g an e ducation ma jor that
would debut in one or two years. T he
idea of addin g the ma jor was sparked
after the California le gislature passed 
a law finally permittin g schools to
have an un dergraduate e ducation 
major after 57 years.
Under graduate education
majors were origina lly banne d in
1961 during the Sputni k Era w here 
lawma kers t hought the education
major was a watere d-down degree,
and teachers weren‚Äôt spendin g enou gh
time learning t he subject content but 
instea d focusin g on teac hing methods.The education stu dies department 
is currentl y in the pre-proposal phase 
and believes that the major will be
finalized either Fa ll of 2019 or 2020. 
The education stu dies faculty is 
current ly envisionin g what the course
catalo g will look like and what the 
areas of focus  will be.
The proposa l called for ne w 
undergraduate courses aroun d
educationa l researc h and having a 
major relevant to students who
want to become teac hers in t he
future. Pro fessor C hris Ha lter o f 
the education stu dies department
emphasizes that the ma jor will go in
depth into three different areas of e
ducation .
‚ÄúThere will be a focus  in [cognitive] development an d learnin g
[about] societ y, language, an d culture,
and divin g into educational research, ‚Äù
Halter told the UCSD Guardian .
Halter state d that the education
studies department hopes t his ma jor
will be an inter discip linary major.
‚ÄúThe ma jor would include courses
in co gnitive science, socio logy, [an d]
human development. ‚Äù
Roger Reve lle Co llege sop homore
and education studies minor An gel
Lopez stated that he ‚Äúreall y want[s] to 
see a focus on non-STEM e ducation,
we don‚Äôt have enou gh emp hasis on
the arts. ‚Äù
Halter m entioned that the last
year o f the ma jor is w hen stu dents
will finalize their focus  in educat ion studies. Stu dents wi ll have field
experience in e lementar y school, 
high school, graduate sc hool, or
educationa l researc h. Throughout
the major, students are taking a ver y 
simi lar course line, and it is t heir final
year w here t hey decide the pat h they 
want to take for their futures.
Halter said that it is more than 
likely that the ma jor wi ll inc lude
working wit h the Preuss Sc hool
UCSD to gain some field experience 
for the stude nts. The staff would  work 
on solidif ying the partnership the y 
already have wit h the Preuss Sc hool
instea d of creatin g a new one.

instructions on how to dispose 
of any accumulated waste, it was 
never a secret that leftover food is their responsibility to discard off 
campus, nor any ignorance in terms of what are the proper avenues to 
throw away oil. When no vendors came forward as the ones posing 
the environmental hazard, the university threatened enacting strict punitive measures, going as far as 
closing down the farmers‚Äô market altogether if the improper dumping 
were to continue. 
The farmers‚Äô market is widely 
popular among UCSD students, generating a couple million 
dollars per year in revenue, which 
is shared between the Center for 
Student Involvement, and the 
Bookstore. Adhering to campus policy is integral to assuring that the farmers‚Äô market is following sustainable practices and important 
for consumer trust. After reports 
were filed, food vendors have demonstrated total compliance with 
UCSD regulatory guidelines. 
Another topic that was mentioned 
at the committee meeting was the 
possibility of relocating the farmers‚Äô 
market. The area would need to 
be entirely asphalt, vastly limiting the options available. The few areas 
large enough are predominantly parking lots, which raised concerns 
about reducing the already-limited number of available parking spaces..
Another option considered 
was Library Walk. Though it is an area designated for student organizations, a significant portion of the revenue collected from the 
farmers‚Äô market by the university goes back to funding student 
initiatives, serving as a benefit for the student body as a whole. 
The possibility of relocation is 
still in question, and many of the final decisions will be taking place at the next meeting.    
Tom Bonetati, director of 
trademark and licensing for the 
UCSD Bookstore Office spoke with 
the Guardian on the importance of 
having changes in oversight be a 
unified effort.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always looking for 
student collaboration, and campus 
and staff and faculty involvement 
as well, so we welcome as much feedback regarding changes to the 
farmers‚Äô market as people would like to see, ‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very 
popular, it‚Äôs increasing in volume every single week. ‚ÄùNEW S  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , FEBRUARY 26, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3
merchandise comes from the Target 
distribution center located in Rialto, 
CA, and the other 10 percent from 
local vendors. Their waste disposal is located inside the store building, 
and they explained that they would 
‚Äúpotentially be a part of a larger building here. ... We would integrate 
into [the UCSD Bookstore‚Äôs] trash system, ‚Äù Jones stated.
According to the Target 
representatives, the timeline of this 
potential Target store on campus 
would ‚Äúdepend on the amount of 
positive feedback from the UCSD community. If given the green light, 
it would be set to open its doors in 
2020. ‚Äù
When asked about the 
hiring process and whether it would integrate into UCSD‚Äôs, the representatives answered that all Target new hires would be directly through the corporation, but 
employees would ‚Äúabide by the 
UC System Fair Wage Guidelines, and there would not be a Union 
requirement. ‚Äù 
There are currently three small-
format Target stores near college campuses in California. The first 
one opened at UC Berkeley in 2013, and two opened last summer 
near UC Irvine and at University of Southern California. Hayden 
clarified that none of these Target 
stores are located on the campus but are adjacent or very close to the 
campuses. The proposal of opening 
a Target store on a campus, such as UCSD, is a new concept for the 
major retailer.dictated by others. 
‚ÄúThe debate is not about the Films 
of Woody Allen course; it is about the 
principle of academic freedom and the right of faculty to teach courses on 
subjects they believe are interesting 
and important, ‚Äù Horwitz said. 
Chancellor Khosla shared a 
similar opinion, stating to the San 
Diego Union-Tribune, ‚ÄúI would have 
told her to move on and get out of my 
classroom. I get to teach in my class. ‚Äù
Lyon told the Guardian that 
the responses she has received are 
indicative of an even bigger issue. 
‚ÄúStudents don‚Äôt have a voice on 
this campus and we need to discuss as a community what needs to be done 
to solve that problem, ‚Äù Lyon told the Guardian. 
While student organizations such 
as the UCSD College Democrats and Anti-Oppression Committee have 
reached out to Lyon in support of her petition to remove the course, other 
students are speaking out in favor of 
academic freedom.
Gregory Lu, a Roger Revelle 
College senior, told the Guardian 
that Allen‚Äôs behaviors should not take away from the discussion of his films.  
‚ÄúWoody Allen‚Äôs actions, while 
traumatic and disgusting, should not 
undermine what the purpose of this 
theater class is attempting to teach, ‚Äù 
Lu stated.
Theater professor Steven Adler, 
who teaches the course, was 
unavailable for comment. The film 
course has been offered to UCSD students since the 1990s. 
When asked if artists with 
controversial pasts deserve societal recognition, Lyon responded ‚ÄúThe 
question is whether or not these artists should be taught in an 
academic institution ‚Ä¶ which is 
what is happening currently with the 
Films of Woody Allen. Should these 
artists have a platform where they are 
glorified? No. That is what is being addressed here. ‚Äù
In a recent statement made by the 
UCSD Academic Senate, the group 
announced that it plans to ‚Äúsupport 
the right to the continued teaching 
of this course now and in the future. ‚Äù Employees Will Work Under the Target Company

doesn‚Äôt even provide monetar y compensation 
to offset these costs. Man y times, students, who
constitute one of the most vulnerable groups in
societ y due to their high amount of debt, will
have to work another job during the internship 
just to provide basic necessities for themselves.
There is an underl ying assumption that students
ZLOO UHFHLYH WKH √ÄQDQFLDO VX SSRUW IURP WKHL U
parents or famil y needed to work at an unpaid 
internship. However, this assumption caters to WKHDI√ÅXHQWPHPEHUVRIVRFLHW
\)RUSHRSOHRI
color especiall y, the fact that white households
earn $24,000 more than black or Latino
households means that these unpaid internships
are reserved for a sector of societ y that is not 
representative of the diverse workforce.
Unfortunatel y, companies offering these
internships overlook the rest of the population,
with their own unique backgrounds and
abilities, solel y because the y lack the same
privilege as white upper-class households.  
The experience that unpaid internshipscan offer might be worthwhile if the y are nea r 
where the students live. H owever f or students
that d on‚Äôt live in the cities that h ost the m ost 
LQWHUQVKLSVVXFKDV1HZ<RUN/RV$Q JHOHV
and San Francisco, the y will have to pa y the
high cost of living to reside there. It is estimated
that housing in large cities costs $3,500, transportation costs $360, and food costs, $1200
per month, adding up to an expensive total of 
$5,060 while earning $0 in monthl y income. 
Internships are seen as a means b y which 
students can prove themselves in the workplace.
However, with students barel y able to pa y their 
tuition, an unpaid internship seems to be aluxur
y that not man y can afford despite being 
one that could have the capacit y to determine 
their economic mobilit y in life.
Students who can‚Äôt afford to gain that unpaid

Without a doubt, if you‚Äôre an undergraduate
student here at UC San Diego, you have been 
subjected to the hellacious inconsistenc y of 
assessment st yles among the universit y‚Äôs
professors. For better or for worse, the
administration‚Äôs laissez-faire polic y with
respect to course regulation has birthed an
obscenel y diverse population of rubric-based
grading schemata.
Virtuall y all professors implement some
form of concrete standards b y which student 
performance ma y be assessed, such as an answe r 
key for a multiple choice exam, a checklist fo r 
a lab report, or a list of criteria for a successful
essay. However, one professor might follow the
rubric with the mercilessness of a drill sergeant 
and another might grade with the stringenc y
RIDFDP SXVSROLFHRI√ÄFHU¬¥VX SHUYLVLQJ¬µWKH
annual Sun God Music Festival. And, though 
some might consider the strictness or laxness
of a professor‚Äôs assessment st yle merel y an
acquired taste, the effect on students of a
professor‚Äôs particular rubric-based assessment 
style is far more substantial than a potential
letter grade.
The problem is not with rubrics themselves.
Rather, the problem arises from the occasional obsession with rubrics. Afterall, rubrics do
allow professors to fairl y grade the works
of their students with minimal bias and
remarkable consistenc y. Moreover, rubrics
demand a standard of qualit y from students‚Äô 
DVVLJQPHQWVWKDWUH√ÅHFWVWKHH[ SHFWDWLRQVWKD W
will almost certainl y be placed on graduates
by future emplo yers and higher-ups. That being said, the extent of the abuse of rubrics
by some universit y professors is abhorrent and
detrimental to the development of tomorrow‚Äôs 
innovators.
To that point, a professor‚Äôs insistence that 
a student strictl y abide b y a rubric is nothing
short of Pavlovian conditioning. In such a 
classroom experiment, if the test sub ject 
submits to the rubric, it will be rewarded and 
will, thus, receive an acceptable grade. Though, 
if the test sub ject stra ys from the rubric, it will 
be punished and will, consequentl y, receive
poor marks. The results of this experiment 
could be h ypothesized b y any individual with
half of a brain. However, such speculation is
unwarranted, for the experiment has alread y
been conducted, and as expected, students
subjected to strictl y enforced rubrics eithe r 
learn to satisf y the grading criteria or drop the 
course within f our weeks. 
This kind of conditioning is belittling and
dehumanizing, as it suggests to students that 
their opinions are insubordinate to those of thei r 
professors. Furthermore, professors insistent on
ignorantl y upholding their rubric in the face of any and all dissenting voices are effectivel y 
coaxing their students from the pastures of 
creativit y to the butcher y of conformit y,
where the y are to be bred for meekness and 
complacenc y.  
A stud y conducted b y KH Kim, Ph.D. 
involving 270,000 youths and adults, revealed 
that American creativit y, after a stead y increase 
between 1966 and 1990, has experienced
a substantial decline. According to Kim, 
this failure was a result of the div orce of 
educational institutions from a philosoph y that 
emphasizes the importance of teaching students
non-conformit y, risk-taking, and curiosit y. 
Shockingl y, these three admirable attributes are
not synonyms for the choice words I previousl y
used to describe Pavlov‚Äôs brood. From this, one FDQUHDVRQDE
O\SUHVXPHWKDWLQ√ÅH[LE OHUXEULF
based assessment st yles are, in part, to blame
for the decline in American creativit y as it has 
been recorded b y Kim .
This is an issue of utmost importance, as
creativit y fuels discover y and innovation.
Furthermore, UCSD is a tier-one research universit
y with a reputation built on the
groundbreaking discoveries and innovations of 
LWVDI√ÄOLDWHV7KXV LI8&6'ZDQWVWRPDNHD
tradition of this reputation, it must invest in the
future b y encouraging risk-taking rather than 
caution at the undergraduate level, rewarding
boldness rather than timidit y, and nurturing
students who are daring enough to ‚Äúthink
outside the rubric.‚Äù

costs associated with these unpaid internships. This not 
only furthers the divide between those who are privileged
and can afford these internships, but it ends up widening the
gap between their qualit y of education as well. The students
able to acquire an unpaid internship will potentiall y be
‚Äúmore educated‚Äù in the e yes of a future emplo yer compared
to the applicants who couldn‚Äôt afford a real life workplace

ORDQVRURWKHU√ÄQDQFLD OREOLJDWLRQVWKH SULYLOHJHGDUHDEOH

Technologies Matt Sigelman states that ‚Äúsummer jobs are
not going to position you for work after graduation.‚Äù This
statement is further legitimized b y the fact that startingsalaries for graduates with an y internship experience average
about $52,000, compared with $37,000 for those without

with a Sophie‚Äôs choice: either the y risk a potential highe r

UCSD should provide grants for students seeking

Amidst t he quiet t hat norma lly accompanies 
winter quarter, Black Histor y Month is a sudden
explosion o f activit y and color that consumes t he
entire mont h of February. Wit h multiple events spannin g
ever y single day and diverse activities ran ging from vivi d
film screenin gs to lectures on Sene galese s harps hooters,
Black History Mont h is anyt hing but quiet. 
In fact, the ver y essence of Black Histor y Month screams
to be seen an d heard. Goin g
back as far as 1976 , Blac k 
Histor y Mont h encapsu lates
an annua l period dedicate d
to the celebration of the 
achievements and roles of 
African-Am ericans and 
Africans throughout world 
histor y. It is meant as a
tribute to a group o f peop le
who have been overlooked
and abused in histor y ‚Äî a
group o f peop le who ou ght
to have been reco gnize d
and res pecte d for t heir
achievements and humanit y a lon g time a go. For those at
UCSD an d across t he wor ld, Black Histor y Mont h serves as
a time to a ppreciate diverse cu ltures an d peoples. 
This year, markin g the hundredth anniversar y of World
War I, the theme of Black Histor y Month is ‚ÄúAfrican -
Americans in Times of War. ‚Äù For UCSD, this theme has
taken a more speci fic route, wit h the plannin g committeechanging it to ‚ÄúWar and Peace: the Complexity of History, 
Service, and Activism within the Black Dias pora. ‚Äù 
Reflectin g this t heme are t he events t hemse lves,
beginnin g with the Week 3 ‚ÄúWe are Abroad‚Äù workshop 
‚Äî which explored black experiences stud ying abroad ‚Äî
and endin g with the Week 9 lecture ‚ÄúWe Demand: The 
Universit y and Stu dent Protests‚Äù given by guest spea ker
Dr. Roderick Fer guson. With other festive events such
as t he lively OceanView 
Terrace Black History 
elebration luncheon , 
fro-Cari bbean Dance
nd Drummin g Workshop, 
nd a performance b y East
frican retro-pop group 
lsarah & the Nubatones
otted throu ghout the
onth, UCSD has gone a ll
ut in the celebration. 
‚ÄúOver the past ei ght or
ne years, B lack Histor y 
onth has reall y grown 
UCSD, ‚Äù Bennetta Ju les-
Rosette , the director of both the African studies minor
and African an d African-American Researc h Center ,
commented. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very important time. A lot of [student
orgs or the minor pro gram] that specialize in black studies
use B lack Histor y Mont h to s howcase w hat pro grams
they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs a lso important for stu dents, so t hatBlack History Month 
is an all-out one-month celebration of Africans and African-Americans in history. Sponsoring around 50 to 60 different events, UC San Diego has become a frontrunner in the celebration of this event. At the same time, it is more than that. In a way, Black History Month provides a cultural window that leads to a greater understanding of diversity.

students ‚Ä¶ can be expose d t o  s o m e  o f these t hings in
more or less a fun wa y. Because sometimes it‚Äôs a lecture
but sometimes it mi ght be like a dance wor kshop or just
a lunch. So it‚Äôs about education but it‚Äôs also about fun. ‚Äù 
Events suc h as t hese are w hat add a bit of life to 
campus amidst the gloom of winter quarter.
‚ÄúI think I almost like this time of year the best at
UCSD because everyw here you go t here‚Äôs goo d food, 
there‚Äôs all kinds of thin gs happenin g, and these thin gs
are a ll open to ever ybody on t he campus, ‚Äù Ju les-Rosette
said. ‚ÄúSo what UCSD is doin g to celebrate Black Histor y 
Month, I think, is reall y good. ‚Äù
UCSD has prove d to be one o f the leaders in ce lebratin g
Black Histor y Month. In fact, UCSD is one of the onl y 
UC sc hools to dedicate t he entiret y of Februar y to t his
celebration, wit h most sc hools on ly dedicatin g one
to two weeks. UCSD also provides around 50 to 60
activities over t he course o f the mont h, ensurin g that
students wi ll get a full range of different experiences t hat
suit their in dividual  interests.
This plethora o f opportunities is helped by the fact t hat 
so man y different departments and people are willin g to
contri bute. Wit h preparations usua lly beginnin g in ear ly 
August, it ta kes a massive amount o f cooperation an d
coordination amon g several groups of people in order to 
make Black Histor y Mont h happen .
‚Äú[I think Black Histor y Month is so great] because 
faculty, staff, and students have joine d together an d just
worked really hard to ma ke it a good mont h. ‚Ä¶ Ever yone
brin gs their contribution to the whole month, ‚Äù Jules -
Rosette said. ‚ÄúI think Chancellor Khosla tries to su pport
this through the Equit y, Diversit y, and Inc lusion. An d
the EDI, the y support some of the fundin g of it. And I
think that the campus va lues it because t hey see it rea lly 
works as a time of celeb ration.‚Äù
However, B lack Histor y Mont h represents more t han
just a mere ce lebration. In a wa y, it serves as a remin der
of the racism that African-Americans and African people
went an d continue to go through today. For examp le,
2010‚Äôs Compton Coo kout is sti ll fresh in UCSD‚Äôs histor y, 
a school normall y known for its diverse environment.
Including the recent disruptions an d distur bances ma de
by white supremacists on campus, B lack Histor y Mont h
is needed  now m ore than ever.
With the tota l num ber o f African-American an d
African students at UCSD ran ging around a mere 1.5 to
2 percent o f the tota l population, it is c lear t hat this is a 
group t hat is severe ly underrepresente d. In fact, UCSD only has two minors, in A frican stu dies an d African -
American stu dies, whereas sc hools suc h as UC Riversi de
and UCLA have full African studies ma jors.
For man y, Black Histor y Mont h serves as an important
reminder of diversit y. As a student, it can become eas y 
to immerse onese lf amon g those w ho share a simi lar
race or culture. With several clubs and activities lar gely 
centerin g aroun d different racia l lines an d distinctions,
diversit y can quic kly become mute d. But it is t hrough
events and celebrations such as these that people are
given t he opportunit y to break out o f their com fort
zones an d experience somet hing outsi de of themse lves. 
This represents the true si gnificance of Black Histor y 
Mont h ‚Äî that it is not just ma de for A fricans or A frican -
Americans, but for ever yone to partake in and share .
‚ÄúBlack Histor y Month brin gs out these various [racist]
behaviors an d it‚Äôs not like it en ded with the Com pton
Cookout. It is on going on this campus ‚Ä¶ this whole floor 
is un der the cam pus police patrol for the whole Black 
Histor y Mont h, because we‚Äôve had van dalism, we‚Äôve
had peop le comin g in c lasses w ho weren‚Äôt suppose d to 
be in c lasses. So a ll of the things that starte d with the
Compton Coo kout are sti ll just un der the sur face, ‚Äù Ju les-
Rosette  said. 
‚ÄúI think the real answer to [reducin g racism] is in the
course, is in havin g students share all these thin gs. When
you have B lack Histor y Mont h, it‚Äôs for ever ybody. It‚Äôs not
just for black students or stu dents intereste d in black 
studies: It‚Äôs for the whole campus. So the more that you
can promote intercu ltural exc hange, the more racism
disappears. Racism is based on lack of know ledge, lack 
of ability to interact wit h peop le from different cu ltures
and backgroun ds. So t he more peop le from different 
cultures and back grounds come to gether ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs
through their courses or socia l activities ‚Äî t he better. ‚Äù
Not ever yone has to ta ke the African stu dies minor 
or even enroll in a course in order to beco me more
culturally aware. At t he ver y least, it is important in 
this day and age to become more open an d expose d to
various cu ltures. B lack Histor y Mont h gives peop le that
opportunit y. Already in full swin g, it has given stu dents
a full 28 da ys brimmin g with opportunit y and activit y 
that is both open an d accessi ble. W hether it comes to
joinin g African dance or mere ly sittin g and eatin g a mea l
at OVT, these activities serve as important e ye-openers
for UCSD stu dents.‚ñ∂BLACK HI STORY M ONTH,from pa ge 6

or not, t hey have some interestin g insi ghts to o ffer this wee k. So grab some tea, get
comfortable, and start readin g!
Aries
Aries, you ma y current ly feel as if somet hing is holding you back. It ma y be a person,
a feeling, an event, or an ything, but it is hard to let go of. Remem ber, you are t he on ly 
person w ho can contro l your own feelings, so ta ke charge and live life freely.
Tauru s
So man y changes have entere d your life recent ly, Taurus. As a stea dy Eart h sign who
loves consistenc y, this is frightenin g and nerve-wrac king. Despite t he slight anxiet y 
it ma y cause, chan ge is good. Take this stru ggle and learn to grow from it. Thin gs are
lookin g up.
Gemin i
An unusua l feeling of sloth has come over you lately, Gemini. It has affected not on ly 
the body, but the min d. This ma y be due to recent un healthy actions. To com bat this, get
some exercise an d eat t hose greens! Y ou wi ll be feeling great an d back to norma l soon .
Cance r
Famil y and friends mean ever ything, but a certain person has been a pain. The y are
usuall y so eas y to get alon g with, but somethin g has chan ged. Instead of lettin g this eat
away at you, ta lk to them. One never knows w hat is happenin g in anot her person‚Äôs life,
so hear them out.
Leo
Leo, a lways ver y loud and prou d, your persona lity is stron g and not one to be messe d
with. On t he other hand, sensitivit y and gentleness is nee ded sometimes. Not ever yone
reacts t he same wa y to ever ything. Learn to so ften some rou gh edges an d see w here it
can lead.
Virgo
Meticu lous is your mi ddle name, Vir go, but mista kes are ma de sometimes. It is
necessar y to not dwell on t hese errors. T he past is t he past, an d ever yone has to let go
of it at some point. Do not let former mis haps ruin t he future. Start over an d shoot for
the stars.Libra
A new opportunit y has presente d itself, Libra, but it wi ll not be an eas y task to ta ke on.
You must make the decision to commit to it; onl y then will new blessin gs be presented.
Do not be afraid and get cau ght up in the ‚Äúwhat ifs. ‚Äù The y will onl y prevent you from
succee ding.
Scorpio
Scorpio, you possess passions for man y things, which is a good thing; however, t his
can be overw helming. Being a part o f too many t hings can be draining. Learn to pic k 
and choose commitments because at t he end of the day, you are your most important
commitment.
Sagittariu s
Sagittarius, you are often ver y independent and firm re gardin g decisions, but this has 
been compromised. Recentl y, you feel forced to do somethin g. It is eas y to sa y ‚Äúyes, ‚Äù but
saying ‚Äúno‚Äù is OK and necessar y at times, so do not feel bad for sa ying it.
Capricor n
Emotiona l expression is not a common strengt h for Capricorns, but it has its moments
to shine. Y our loved ones know how deeply you care for them, but voca l remin ders can
do wonders. Remember to call your mom and tell her you love her .
Aquariu s
Aquarius season ha s  c o m e  t o  a n  e n d, but it was un deniably a great mont h for
Aquarii ever ywhere. T he growt h and stren gth uncovere d during this time s hould not be
forgotten. Ta ke this new found development an d explore its potentia l.
Pisces
Y es, t he wait has been long and difficult, but it is finally Pisces season. T his upcomin g
month has so muc h to o ffer. Emotiona l intuition wi ll be off the charts, so ta ke advanta ge
of this. Also, a new love, passion, or happiness wi ll enter life soon. Be open to ever ything.
Wow, these horoscopes have a lot of potential, ri ght? Remember, the cosmos know all, 
so keep your horoscope in min d this wee k. Unti l next time, Astro- lovers !By Natas ha Van damme
// Contri buting Writer:
This year, on Apri l 27th, it wi ll be my mom an d
dad‚Äôs 27th weddin g anniversar y. Before m y parents
were marrie d in 1991, t hey met seven years prior 
on a blind date. M y dad, 29, an d my mom, 18, met
for dinner at the house  of a mutual  friend and as the
story goes, t hey hit it o ff. At t he end of the night, my 
dad walked my mom out to t he car an d asked for her
num ber. No pieces o f paper avai lable, my dad pulled
out a little matc hbook, where m y mom wrote her
name and number. Handin g the matchbook over,
my mom tried to nonchalantl y ask m y dad when she
thought he‚Äôd give her a ca ll. Playing t hings equa lly 
as coo l, my dad told her he‚Äôd see how t he wee kend 
turned out and probabl y call her around then.
He ca lled the next day. 
I always love hearin g this stor y because m y dad
is not exact ly what I t hink of as a romantic in an y 
way. Ever y year, Valentine‚Äôs Da y went the same in
my house; Da d stoppe d at t he grocer y store on t he
way home from wor k to scroun ge for a bouquet o f 
flowers from the nearl y empt y floral section, a bo x 
of chocolates, and alwa ys one of those ‚ÄúY ou drive
me craz y, but I love you an yway‚Äù Hallmark cards.
My sister and I would each receive our own kid -
sized chocolate boxes an d cheesy card. (I know I 
still have a card featurin g the cast of ‚ÄúCamp Rock‚Äù
sittin g in m y room somew here.‚Ä¶) I on ly remem ber
looking forwar d to t he day because it was t he one 
night a year m y parents would splur ge on orderin g
Chinese ta keout for dinner. A ll other anniversaries
and birthdays wor ked just a bout t he same wit h my 
dad. Most o f the time, it was my sister an d I dragging 
him to the mall so we could guide him throu gh the 
process o f gift giving. My mom wou ld always hintto us w hat she had been e yeing, knowin g we wou ld
be the ones pic king presents out, not my dad. This
system wor ked, though. My dad mana ged to cover
the basics: never extrava gant, but alwa ys showed up
in some wa y.
My parents‚Äô marria ge can be descri bed as
decentl y avera ge; I don‚Äôt remember ever reall y havin g
a babysitter because t hey always sta yed in wit h
my sister an d I. Over t he years, t hey faced their
challenges as most marrie d coup les do. I know m y 
mom secretl y wished for a little more (do not get her 
starte d on t he sheer c heapness o f her we dding ring!).
Financia lly, she knew an y sort o f grand gesture wasn‚Äôt
exact ly realistic. M y mom an d dad underwent hard
times to gether and ma ybe had more than their fair
share o f fights, but they staye d toget her throug h it all.
However, in Apri l of 2014, my dad was diagnose d 
with Sta ge IV kidne y cancer. He had just about made
it to nine mont hs before he lost his battle in Januar y 
of 2015.
My dad alwa ys had a bedside table next to him
where he kept his glasses, watc h, and alarm c lock.
There was a drawer , but I had never looked insi de 
of it. A few months after m y dad‚Äôs passin g, my mom
and I looked through it to gether. We found some
old paperwork, a few ‚Äú#1 Dad‚Äù drawings from m y 
sister and I, a ke ychain given to him b y the plumber‚Äôs
union he had worked for, and an Eric Claptonconcert ticket from 1987. Underneath all of that
,
there was one more t hing. There was somet hing that
ended up matterin g more than an ything else to m y

Transferring from my small town of Bakersfield, to a larger city in San 
Diego felt like being a student-athlete drafted to play in the big league. 
Arriving at UC San Diego, I thought I could accurately predict what 
my college experience would be like ‚Äî effortless and full of late-night 
adventures. 
This conception was soon upended after my first quarter was in the 
books and grades were released. Unsatisfied with both my academic performance and GPA, I felt my grades did not accurately depict the student I was. The only explanation I gave myself for this, was that maybe 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a bad test taker. ‚Äù 
I started to routinely associate with this justification whenever a 
classmate would ask me why I performed so poorly on an exam. In reality, I was not prepared for the competitive nature and higher standard that 
is expected from UCSD students. Classes are often taught by respected research professors, expecting students to dedicate hours digesting and 
learning the in-depth material in a narrow time frame.
It was second quarter midterms when I decided to no longer be 
defined by my poor grades. This realization stemmed from an insightful conversation with a close friend from my community college. After 
listening to my predicament, he quickly pinpointed why I was earning those low test scores. The undeniable fact was, a good test taker prioritizes school over their 
social life. The ‚Äú A ‚Äù student takes care of all academic responsibilities first, 
before arranging a fun night with friends. Reflecting back to last quarter, I 
recognized that more of my time was spent hanging out than studying. As a result, my grades suffered and left me to blame no one besides myself. 
This realization was painful to accept, but he was right. The student 
who‚Äôs actively preparing and reviewing material early on, compared to another who crams weeks of information the day before the exam, will achieve significantly different scores. The moral of this story is this: You 
get out what you put in. 
Now, what about those who face difficulty in taking tests? The students 
who experience an uncontrollable amount of test anxiety, consequently leading them to perform badly on every exam. Well, first I‚Äô d agree with 
them that assessments may not be the best indicator of whether or not a student is competent enough on a concept or subject. 
There are many external factors that could offer an explanation for why 
someone performs badly on a test. Unfortunately, we have no control over this aspect of education. Instead of opposing this, we must focus on the 
one thing we can control ‚Äî our effort. Knowing the fact that we may not 
be great at tests, we can use this as an enforcer to be on top of assignments early on. 
Call it what you want, vaginas (biologically) or ‚Äúhoneypot‚Äù (apparently) at UC San Diego, 
but there is plenty of conversation to be had. This past weekend, an all-womxn student group 
performed Eve Ensler‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Vagina Monologues‚Äù and compiled UCSD TheirStories to give a 
voice to the vagina.  
AO : What did you think of the production in general? 
BL: To be honest, I went to bed after seeing the show, and so my thoughts are still being 
processed. But I did get a chance to see VagMo last year, and it was interesting to see the various 
ways the same pieces were interpreted. Each womxn really claimed the piece for herself and 
gave their unique voice to issues about sexuality, the female body, and gendered identities that 
transcend over time. I also think there was an evident level of care that went into the production 
of the space itself; I appreciated the communal collage backdrop for the show and the list of 
womxn who inspired and empowered the cast and crew included in the playbill. It seemed to 
create a culture that claimed a femininity to all, both past and present. 
AO : It made me miss theater a lot, actually. I miss being up on stage and telling people‚Äôs 
stories, and I think it was really brave of all the womxn in the production to perform a piece like 
this, especially when we know that a lot of the country still doesn‚Äôt believe in womxn‚Äôs rights. I 
thought it was especially interesting how they brought up Trump and how he‚Äôs not only a non-
advocate, but a perpetrator himself, and he‚Äôs the one leading this country. 
All in all, I really enjoyed the show, but, in a way, it was almost frustrating because it‚Äôs like 
preaching to the choir. A lot of people in the room probably already believed in the ideals that 
the performance was advocating for, and the people that need to hear it most were probably not 
present. 
BL: I appreciate your comment about how the people in the crowd might already share 
similar values and that there might be those who need to hear these stories but are not there. I‚Äôm chewing on that, do you feel like if there are those who don‚Äôt necessarily share these ideals sitting 
in the crowd, it would feel like a safe space for such vulnerable storytelling? I guess it also begs 
the question of what the intent of VagMo is too. Is it storytelling? Is it awareness and advocacy? 
A bit of both? 
AO : I think that‚Äôs a good point too. I guess, at UCSD, the purpose seems to be more 
empowerment and support than anything else. I think the existence of the piece itself is powerful 
enough ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost showing that we‚Äôre not afraid to talk about these things anymore. 
BL: True. I love that sentiment that there is so much power and ownership in the existence 
of it. The fact there is a creative platform like this existing for both expression and advocacy says a lot. I think something else that was striking was the amount of audience participation 
in being able to reclaim certain words ‚Äî and thus body parts ‚Äî or in the ‚Äúsay her name‚Äù piece 
to indirectly give voice and awareness to survivors of sexual abuse. There was a lot of shared 
ownership last night. Did you have a favorite piece from last night?
AO : I really liked the piece about the womxn who was asexual. I have a friend who‚Äôs asexual, 
but I‚Äôve never really asked him about his experiences, just because I didn‚Äôt want to overstep 
and I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to begin that conversation. That monologue gave a voice to a 
community I feel like not a lot of people know a lot about. 
I also feel like my favorite pieces were the ones that made me the most uncomfortable. Like 
the moaning piece, initially I felt ‚Äúmerrgghh‚Äù when I was watching it, but then it forced me to 
take a step back and ask, oh, why do I feel this way? So it was almost a challenge to unpack the 
thoughts and uneasiness I didn‚Äôt know I had, which I welcomed and appreciated. What about 
you?BL: The piece that stood out to me was probably ‚ÄúThe Flood. ‚Äù I feel like sometimes when it 
comes to sexuality and the female body, we often don‚Äôt get a chance to hear from womxn over the age of 40. It‚Äôs almost like at the brink of 39, sex is so taboo and the female body must be hidden, 
you know? So I really liked how this piece gave some insight into how words shared at a young 
age can lead to internalized misogyny, affecting the way womxn see themselves, their bodies and 
their sexuality over time, but also voicing that you are no less of a woman when you pass your 
20s or 30s. 
AO : Do you think this changed your definition of feminism or what it means to be a womxn?
BL: I don‚Äôt think VagMo necessarily changed my definition of feminism, but it did showcase 
a side of feminism that we might not often see in the overtly visible political or social culture. To me, sexuality has always been a more nuanced and quieted part of my own understanding 
of feminism, and as I‚Äôm learning and listening to more stories, I do appreciate the more holistic perspectives and intersectional experiences being shared through VagMo, and hope it continues 
to do the same in future productions. 
AO : I would agree. I don‚Äôt think it changed my definition, but it gave voices to the womxn 
that I knew existed but didn‚Äôt necessarily acknowledge until last night. 
All proceeds from ‚ÄúThe Vagina Monologues‚Äù at UCSD went to Break the Silence, a non-profit 
supporting survivors of domestic violence, and License to Freedom, a non-profit that promotes education, awareness, and safe spaces for refugee and immigrant womxn who face or are

‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù presents a new teen classic with character, sincerit y, and lots of heart .
The film adaptation of Beck y Albertalli‚Äôs
beloved young-adult novel ‚ÄúSimon vs.
the Homo Sapien A genda‚Äù features 
enou gh teen-movie-star veterans to make for 
a so lid high school flick; Kat herine Lan gford
(‚Äú13 Reasons Wh y‚Äù), Kei ynan Lonsdale
(‚ÄúDiver gent‚Äù), and Jennifer Garner ( ‚ÄúJuno‚Äù).
However, ‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù goes be yond the trite
formu la an d turns t he basic narrative ri ght on
its head, thankfully surpassin g the tra gic, an gsty 
gay tropes t hat plague most LGBTQ films.
Seventeen- year-old closeted Simon Spier
(Nic k Robinson) lives t he life of any high school
senior ‚Äî gettin g iced coffee wit h his three best 
friends, participatin g in the school musical,
and countin g down t he days unti l graduation.
However, t hings change when Simon discovers
there‚Äôs another bo y at school harborin g the same
secret, but Simon doesn‚Äôt know an ything about
him, ot her than an emai l and a pseu donym.
Simon t herefore reac hes out un der the alias ‚ÄúJacques, ‚Äù and to his surprise, ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù (Bram 
Green field) emai ls him back. Watc hing Simon 
confide in B lue is definite ly heartwarmin g, but
the plot twists and turns when Simon‚Äôs emails
become compromise d and his digital safe haven 
beco mes a collect ion of black mail material.
The plot of the movie mirrors t he book well,
translatin g Simon‚Äôs heartfelt stor y seamlessl y 
onto the silver screen. The film flits between 
Simon‚Äôs sc hool and home life, and the viewer 
catches little glimpses o f Simon‚Äôs wor ld between
it all. From the ‚ÄúAdventure Time‚Äù fi gurines
and Panic! At t he Disco posters in his room to
his Dan Ra dcliffe-induced sexua l awa kenin g,
Simon is not on ly a re latable character, but
one t hat feels as rea l as a friend. He‚Äôs incre dibly 
sympat hetic, emotiona l, an d genuine, w hich
is difficult to find with a male lead of a teen
movie.
‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù is comedic but not chees y; it 
is dramatic, but not over ly so. T he film stri kesa per fect balance between t hese two genres
and makes for an en joyable watch without
the au dience e ye-rolling at a desperate jab
appea ling to mi llennia l humor. T he soun dtrack 
features new son gs from Bleachers, Tro ye Sivan, 
and Khalid, which successfull y complement
ever y scene. Appropriate ly enou gh, it‚Äôs music
that Simon would have in his own pla ylist.
The writin g is witt y and modern, and while 
the adults don‚Äôt p lay too big a ro le in t he movie,
they don‚Äôt remain in t he backgroun d either. 
Y es, ‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù can be considered a famil y 
movie, but it‚Äô s more a bout Simon‚Äôs journe y and
little triump hs than an ything else.
While the film does  take a few artistic
liberties, suc h as bumpin g Simon‚Äôs a ge up
to 17, t he sma ll change is un derstan dable; it 
emphasizes t hat Simon‚Äôs time to come out
durin g high school is swi ftly comin g to a c lose.
The chan ge isn‚Äôt impactful enou gh to jeopardize 
the inte grity of the nove l, but it does tie in t hebroader theme o f the stor y. While comin g out
is important to Simon, ‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù is more
than just a comin g-out stor y, an d the film 
strives to demonstrate just t hat.
‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù is a love stor y, but it‚Äôs not
about him fallin g in love, reall y. Figurin g out 
who Blue is comes secon d to t he rea l plot, 
which is Simon figurin g out himse lf. Simon
learns to love himse lf before lovin g someone 
else, not throu gh lovin g someone else .
No, t he movie isn‚Äôt outra geous ly min d-
blowin g. But it is a nice watc h that leaves you 
with a warm, fuzz y feelin g and a few happ y 
tears. ‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù is a love letter (or email,
in this case), to new beginnin gs an d finding
oneself and ma ybe someone else alon g the wa y.
Just ma ybe.

In her latest album, Brandi Carlile delivers a soul-baring slice of Americana. ‚ÄúBy 
the Way, I Forgive Y ou‚Äù is a manifestation of Carlile‚Äôs artistic versatility, toying with 
pop, folk, and rock as the singer-songwriter navigates the tumultuous terrain of post-break-up heartbreak and eventual renewal.
The album‚Äôs opening track, ‚ÄúEvery Time I Hear that Song‚Äù grapples with the 
enduring memory of a former love. Carlile chants the album‚Äôs titular ‚ÄúBy the way, I forgive you‚Äù to gentle guitar plucking and rich three-part harmonies. ‚ÄúThe Joke‚Äù is an impassioned offering to those marginalized by gender binaries and other societally-imposed restrictions, offering words of comfort and promising to turn the tables. In a jubilant chorus, Carlile‚Äôs voice soars with unbridled soul, demonstrating the capacity of her belting range and emotional reach. 
‚ÄúHold Out Y our Hand‚Äù is a thumping, triumphal revelation of grit and 
empowerment. Fast-paced verses of biting, yodeled lyrics document Carlile‚Äôs solitary strife before the shouted proclamation, ‚ÄúThe devil can‚Äôt have my soul. ‚Äù Carlile‚Äôs resonant vocals and unbridled earnesty pervade the song (and album) and elevate her music, allowing her to transcend the potential schmaltz factor with a somewhat hackneyed outro of ‚Äúba da da ba da da. ‚Äù
Toward the middle of the album, Carlile enhances the theme of forgiveness with 
a meditation on faith and unserved justice. In ‚ÄúFulton County Jane Doe‚Äù ‚Äî which opens with a guitar intro referencing Buffalo Springfield‚Äôs ‚ÄúFor What It‚Äôs Worth‚Äù ‚Äî Carlile promises to preserve the memory of a nameless Fulton County murder victim and laments, ‚ÄúGod, the whole world‚Äôs gone crazy / And there‚Äôs only God to blame, ‚Äù before declaring, ‚ÄúY ou‚Äôre more than Fulton County, Fulton County Jane. ‚Äù In ‚ÄúSugartooth, ‚Äù Carlile honors the life and death of a cocaine addict, crying, ‚ÄúHe was a liar, but not a fraud / Living proof that there was no God. ‚Äù 
The album closes with the vulnerable ‚ÄúParty of One. ‚Äù The track begins stripped 
down to Carlile‚Äôs vocals and an accompanying piano as the singer struggles against the specters of isolation and bitterness. She recounts her romantic frustrations and enduring devotion and her eventual surrender to the refrain, ‚ÄúI am yours, ‚Äù cues a swelling orchestral accompaniment that closes out the track. Violin harmonies layer atop one another in an unresolved major chord, culminating on a hopeful note but not quite settling. 
Carlile‚Äôs latest work is a breath of fresh air in a musical landscape seemingly 
dominated by homogeneous synth-infused melancholia and electronically reconfigured vocals. Carlile‚Äôs voice speaks for itself, and there‚Äôs something undeniably appealing about the tried-and-true marriage of acoustic guitars, violins, tambourines, and a steady drum beat. With ‚ÄúBy the Way, I Forgive Y ou, ‚Äù Carlile offers a labor of love and a charming antidote to the banality of modern-day country.

Migos‚Äô ‚ÄúCulture II‚Äù wears its production like haute couture: 
Cardi B, Nicki Minaj, 21 Savage, Drake, Gucci Mane, Travis Scott, Big Sean, Ty Dolla Sign, Post Malone, and 2 Chainz all 
feature. Quavo, DJ Durel, Metro Boomin, Zaytoven, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, and a veritable swarm of producers shepherded the project to completion. It weighs in at a hefty 24 tracks. ‚ÄúCulture II‚Äù is more than an record; it‚Äôs a declaration of their heavyweight hip-hop influence. 
The result? A sonically coherent, sleekly-made beast of an album, 
dripping with collaborators and trap beats. The individual pieces tend to blend together, however; ‚ÄúCulture II‚Äù may be a standout, but its constituent elements often fall flat. Its two singles, ‚ÄúMotorSport‚Äù and ‚ÄúStir Fry, ‚Äù are tepid but radio-friendly. Both squeeze out copious cultural references; ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Monopoly, go cop me some land and some property / AP , Rolls, pink diamonds, whoa / Whip up the soda, diamonds off the Royce, ‚Äù and keep a steady, rolling pace. But the name-dropping overstays its welcome; the Migos lean so heavily on the conceit that it occasionally veers into parody. 
Drake‚Äôs appearance on ‚ÄúWalk It Talk It‚Äù is symptomatic of a larger 
malaise that permeates ‚ÄúCulture II;‚Äù it isn‚Äôt uninspired, but the resulting song is only passable. Other contributors, like Nicki Minaj and 21 Savage, make more of an impact, but ‚ÄúCulture II‚Äôs‚Äù overblown length leaves them floundering. ‚ÄúCulture II‚Äù falls into a call-and-refrain rut, with tracks running over 
four minutes. It could have easily been trimmed to a leaner two-minute length. The sound engineers coat their work in a sumptuous layer of synths and snares, but the resulting melange is more mumbled complaint than searing lyrical commentary.
Nonetheless, ‚ÄúStir Fry‚Äù proves a fun, unruffled dance piece. It‚Äôs 
patently silly, as the lyrics prove, but unlike ‚ÄúMotorSport, ‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt make much of an effort not to be. Rapping about Chinese food over a funky, whistle-flute backdrop makes for a good time. Heck, Migos drops lines about ‚Äúblue cheese‚Äù and ‚Äúcheat code[s], ‚Äù and how ‚ÄúShe got a big ol‚Äô onion booty, make the world cry. ‚Äù Seriousness left the kitchen a while back, apparently.
The remainder of ‚ÄúCulture II‚Äù doesn‚Äôt follow ‚ÄúStir Fry‚Äù‚Äôs tongue-
in-cheek zaniness, which is a pity. Promotional single ‚ÄúSupastars‚Äù is particularly dull ‚Äî copious allusions to ‚ÄúBrand new cars‚Äù and ‚ÄúSwang doors now‚Äù don‚Äôt hold a candle to the kid-in-the-candy-shop glee of ‚ÄúStir Fry. ‚Äù The delivery isn‚Äôt phoned in, but the content is; ‚ÄúCulture II‚Äù isn‚Äôt a bad album, but it lacks the intensity and concentration of the original.

SPORTS  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , FEBRUARY 26, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  15
In its third week of conference 
play, the UC San Diego so ftball team 
squared up against California State 
University, San Marcos. Of the four 
games played ‚Äî two doubleheaders with one on Friday and one on 
Saturday ‚Äî the Tritons swept the 
Cougars, winning all four games. A fter 
this weekend‚Äôs dominant performance, 
UCSD‚Äôs record advances to 13‚Äì4 
(8‚Äì4 in California Collegiate Athletic Association standings).
Game 1
UCSD opened the series strong, 
winning the first contest 5‚Äì1. At 
bat, the Tritons were inconsistent. 
In the first, third, and fifth innings, 
UCSD failed to produce any o ffense 
(combined for zero runs and hits). 
In the second, fourth, and sixth, the 
Tritons were very successful, recording 
seven hits and five runs. Junior third 
baseman Maddy Lewis and freshman catcher Bobbi Aguirre scored for two 
runs apiece. However, UCSD‚Äôs strength 
in this game was its play at field. 
CSUSM was unable to produce while 
at bat, recording only one run and one hit the entire game.
Game 2
In their second game, the Tritons 
were able to find their groove, fixing 
their inconsistencies from the first 
game. UCSD built on the momentum 
from its first game, winning 10‚Äì2 in 
just five innings. The Tritons were 
much more consistent at bat. In all 
five innings, they recorded at least 
one run. The Tritons had six di fferent 
players score points; Aguirre, once 
again, scored two runs. Much like 
the previous game, the Tritons shut down CSUSM whenever it went up to the plate. UCSD‚Äôs play at field 
was highlighted by sophomore first 
baseman Danica Kazako ff as she 
registered eight outs.
Game 3
The Tritons, in their second day 
of the series, built on the momentum 
from their last game, winning 10‚Äì1 
in a commanding fashion. In the 
second inning, the Tritons exploded 
for six runs. The next inning, the 
Cougars seemed to have caught a 
break: the Tritons had zero hits and zero runs. In the fourth inning, UCSD, 
again, shocked CSUSM with another impressive showing. The Tritons 
added five more runs to their already 
commanding lead.
Standout performances in this 
game included senior second baseman 
Kendall Baker‚Äôs three runs and Lewis‚Äô 
and Kazako ff‚Äôs two runs each.
Game 4
The Tritons ended the series with a 
tight 7‚Äì5 victory. Unlike the last three 
games, UCSD was not dominant. 
Going into the fifth innings, UCSD 
was trailing 2‚Äì1. But there, the Tritons rediscovered their mojo. UCSD put 
together four runs, highlighted by a 
spectacular home run hit by Aguirre. The Cougars mounted a fierce 
comeback attempt in the seventh 
inning, scoring three runs; however, 
that would not be enough to overcome the Tritons‚Äô lead.
Next week, the UCSD so ftball 
team hits the road and hopes to extend 
its win streak. They travel to Azusa, 
California on Friday, March 2 to play 
Azusa Pacific University.The UC San Diego men‚Äôs basketball 
team closed out the last two games 
of the season this past week. The 
Tritons faced o ff against California 
State University, Dominguez Hills 
and California State University, Los 
Angeles. Against Dominguez Hills, 
they were met with a heartbreaking buzzer beater that handed them a 77‚Äì76 loss against the Toros. UCSD would use the loss as motivation, blowing 
out CSULA by 20 points (84‚Äì64) two 
days after the loss against Dominguez 
Hills. Splitting the games 1‚Äì1, the 
Tritons finish the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association regular season 
with a record of 15‚Äì7, good enough for 
a third-place tie with California State 
University, San Marcos.
Vs. Dominguez Hills
The first half started slowly, with 
both teams missing a number of field 
goals in the first 10 minutes. The two 
teams stayed within reach of other, 
and it looked like they would just 
trade basketballs. However, around 
the 10:44 mark, a three-pointer by 
Toro senior guard Matt Hayes tied the 
game at 17‚Äì17. Hayes would go on to 
score two more three-pointers in the 
next five minutes that served to ignite 
the Toros o ffense. Within five minutes, 
the Tritons de ficit jumped to 13 points 
(20‚Äì33), and it looked like the game 
was getting away from them. In spite of this, the Tritons stayed strong and 
made multiple defensive stops to cut 
the lead down to five points (32‚Äì37) 
going into the second half.
Right out of the gates, junior guard 
Christian Oshita scored a layup to 
start the second half. Following a missed layup by the Toros, sophomore 
forward Scott Everman sank a three-
pointer to tie the game up at 37‚Äì37. 
For the next 12 minutes, the game 
slowed to a crawl: Neither team could pull ahead by more than five points 
and were trading baskets back and 
forth. But at the 6:56 mark, the Tritons 
pulled ahead ‚Äî a steal from junior 
guard Christian Bayne led to an easy 
three-pointer by senior guard Anthony 
Ballestero. The three-pointer gave the 
Tritons a seven-point lead that they maintained until the 3:59 mark. The 
Toros scored a layup to bring the game 
to 71‚Äì69 and called a timeout. Out of 
the timeout, they switched to a 3‚Äì2 
zone that the Tritons adjusted to a little 
too late. UCSD turned the ball over 
twice following the defensive change 
and saw its lead crumble in under a 
minute. 
With a little over two minutes 
remaining, three o ffensive rebounds 
(one from Oshita and two by senior 
forward Michael Shoemaker) followed 
by a three-pointer from Bayne seemed 
to have secured the game for UCSD. 
The Toros made a layup on the other 
end but committed a foul on redshirt freshman guard Mikey Howell. 
Howell sank both free throws to put 
UCSD up by two, 76‚Äì74, with 1:01 
remaining. Dominguez Hills missed 
a layup, and the Tritons looked to 
close out the game with 39 seconds 
remaining. However, Bayne missed a 
layup with seven seconds le ft, and the 
Toros called a timeout with just four seconds on the clock. Somehow, Toros 
freshman guard Colten Kresl dribbled 
down the entire length of the court to 
sink a buzzer-beating three-pointer 
over three Tritons, crushing UCSD‚Äôs 
spirits and giving Dominguez Hills the 77‚Äì76 victory.
Vs. CSULA
Unlike the game against CSUDH, 
the game against the CSULA Golden Eagles was a very one-sided a ffair. 
UCSD started o ff slow, unable to secure 
a large lead, for the first 10 minutes of 
the half. However, the Tritons‚Äô o ffense 
picked up, and they started raining shots on the Golden Eagles. Bayne led 
the scoring run, with seven points and 
a steal in the span of three minutes. 
The run, in conjunction with great 
defense, gave UCSD an 11-point lead over CSULA heading into hal ftime. 
The Tritons opened the second half 
with smothering defense, stealing the ball twice in the first two minutes of 
the game. Up 40‚Äì25, the Tritons kept their foot on the pedal. Relentless in 
their attack, the Tritons held a 20-point 
lead for most of the half. The Golden 
Eagles had no change, unable to match 
UCSD‚Äôs blistering-hot o ffense.
Three Tritons finished in double 
digits: Bayne had 18, Oshita finished 
with 19, and senior guard George 
Buaku chipped in with 10 of his own. 
Overall, UCSD shot a stellar 33‚Äì61 
(54.1 percent) from the field, eclipsing 
CSULA ‚Äôs field goal percentage of 39 
percent (23‚Äì59 from the field). 
With the regular season over, 
UCSD looks to face o ff against 
California State University, Stanislaus 
in the CCAA Men‚Äôs Basketball 
Tournament Quarter finals. The game 
will be at RIMAC Arena on Tuesday, Feb. 27. Tipo ff is scheduled for 7:30
