It isn’t often that one can say that they’ve been to a “banging” concert during a pandemic. However, the vaccine rollout and proper UC San
Diego COVID-19 protocol has allowed for larger congregations to take place recently; it’s reasonable to say that the most uplifting of these
events are the Weekly Open-Mic Sessions hosted by the up-and-coming band “HappynoT.”
Many students and administrators have seen them before, jamming in front of Café Ventanas with a guitar amplifier you don’t know the name
of, while singing songs you know every line to. Nowadays, you’re likely to hear the twang of Karim Moussa’s blues improvisation on your way
to get dinner at Rooftop or Cameron Thomas’s angelic vibrato whilst picking up a latte from the Sixth Market. HappynoT has evolved into a
beacon of light for UCSD students by creating a sense of community by playing on the most relatable facet of the human experience — music.
“The sense of community probably comes from going to school where music was never really a center-stage for anything … The only time I was
really around other musicians was at my piano lesson recitals,” Thomas told The UCSD Guardian. “Meeting Karim and finally getting this
understanding into the guitar community that is priceless and translates to the performances.”HappynoT's Original Song @ Sixth CollegeHappynoT's Original Song @ Sixth CollegeTo learn more about The UCSD Guardian's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, click here →

The charming duo crossed paths the day before they started studying at John Muir College back in the fall of 2019, largely due to Thomas’s
affinity for playing his acoustic guitar around campus. After a few jam sessions and a few instances of falling out, the group plopped
themselves down in front of the Middle of Muir coffee shop and piqued interest among students — until UCSD administration became
involved.
“Everything was fine and dandy up until the next day, when the entire Muir College gets an email that says ‘It has come to our attention that
there was a concert that was played around 6 pm on Saturday … currently UCSD is not open to public organized events,” Thomas recalled in an
interview with The Guardian. “It was then that we moved to ERC… however, Sixth College was seeing that big stage and imagining in my head
what [future performances] could be.”Photo courtesy of @happynotxo on Instagram.
A typical open-mic goes as follows: the two legends open up shop firing away on their instruments while students amass on the lawn in front of
the stone stage. An employee from the Sixth Market will bring some complementary iced tea to the performers, only to be showered with
praise from the audience. After their warm up, artists drawn from a comprehensive setlist plug themselves in and start jamming away.
Performances range from solo acoustic guitar pieces to full-band covers of popular songs, drawing many students of different backgrounds to
join in on the fun.
Among the Cafe Ventanas employees and international students volunteering is indie artist Alex Miller, a first-year at Seventh College who is
also known as “alexmillerjamz (https://www.google.com/url?

on Instagram and Spotify. Miller disclosed that the level of crowd involvement at the shows is incredibly inspiring and that getting involved is
so easy.
“The biggest thing that inspires me about performing is seeing improvement in myself,” Miller told The Guardian.”I haven’t been singing for
long, so forcing myself to sing in front of people has made me be better due to my fear of absolutely butchering the song.”Photo courtesy of Alexander Olsen

Their final huzzah is meant to strike a chord: the band is holding their final show of the year on June 4th to raise money for Lebanon in light of
multiple developments.
Nearly 300,000 Lebanese citizens became unemployed  (https://www.google.com/url?

Beirut explosion last August. Additionally, the middle-eastern country is experiencing an economic crisis where the country’s national
currency, the Lebanese pound has sunk by 90 percent  (https://www.google.com/url?

UCSD Health Trial Studies Cannabis as Migraine Relief
 June 2, 2021 (https://ucsdguardian.org/2021/06/02/ucsd-health-trial-studies-cannabis-as-migraine-relief/) 
Rodrigo Gutierrez (https://ucsdguardian.org/author/rodrigo-gutierrez/)
To learn more about The UCSD Guardian's coverage of the COVID-19
pandemic, click here →  (https://ucsdguardian.org/tag/covid-19/)UC San Diego Health is currently studying
(https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04360044) cannabis as a treatment for those
suffering from acute migraines. The ongoing trial, which began in November 2020, involves
participants self-medicating with cannabis during four different instances of migraines to
judge its effects on providing migraine relief.
The treatments for self-medication include three different forms of vaporized cannabis: THC,
CBD, and a THC/CBD mix, as well as a placebo. Each form has a different percentage of
potency with THC at five percent, CBD at twelve percent, and the THC/CBD mix containing a
mix of five percent THC and twelve percent CBD.
Participants’ reactions to each cannabis sample are being measured in terms of its effects on
pain freedom and relief, nausea at four different time intervals, and whether or not there is
any experienced sensitivity to sound and light (otherwise known as photophobia and
phonophobia).
The trial, which is the first of its kind and is funded by the nonprofit Migraine Research
Foundation, is categorized as being a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial. This type of
trial prevents any influence on the patients that can alter the conclusions as well as provide
an unbiased result for the trial to study.
Dr. Nathaniel M. Schuster, a pain management specialist and headache neurologist at UCSD
Health and the researcher behind the trial, told The UCSD Guardian that his goal with the
trial is to eliminate any ambiguity related to providing treatment for migraine attacks.
“Many people with migraines self-medicate with cannabis products, but there is very limited
scientific evidence for the efficacy of THC and/or CBD for migraine treatment and which
symptoms of migraine (headache, nausea, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity) cannabinoids
can effectively treat,” he said.
For people like trial participant Alice Knigge, self-medication may be the key to overcoming
the pain of living with migraines. Knigge told NBC San Diego
(https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/uc-san-diego-health-leading-landmark-trial-
testing-cannabis-as-a-treatment-for-migraines/2609346/)that her migraines have had a
tremendous impact on her quality of life and have only worsened over the years.“I would describe my migraines as a piercing pain,” Knigge said. “It feels like my brain is
being squeezed. It causes extreme sensitivity to light and sound and horrible nausea. There
have been times when I have been at a pain level of 6 or higher for approximately 25 days out
of the month.”
Engaging with a trial involving a psychoactive drug such as cannabis may be controversial for
some based on its changing legal status state-by-state.
Although the usage and possession of cannabis is still considered illegal due to its
classification as a Schedule 1 drug (https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-
scheduling)by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the state of California allows its
use for both recreational and medicinal purposes. 
The duality of cannabis’ legality on both federal and state levels has made it prone to negative
misconceptions by the public. Today, cannabis continues to be seen as a gateway drug
(https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana); many still believe it leads
users to seek out stronger drugs, although this is not typically the case.
While cannabis misconceptions still are present in today’s culture, there is a growing
understanding of its medicinal benefits as well. 
The CBD component of cannabis is non-psychoactive and is associated
(https://www.healthline.com/health/cbd-vs-thc#medical-benefits) with aiding anxiety,
depression, and seizures without producing the “high.” However, strong evidence supporting
this conclusion is not widely available.
THC, however, is the psychoactive component of cannabis that produces the “high” and is
associated with aiding in pain and muscle spasticity. It is also recognized for its stronger
likelihood to diminish pain and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be used
as a medical treatment (https://practicalneurology.com/articles/2021-may/medical-
cannabis-for-migraine-pain).
The results from this trial may pave the way for other similar trials to use cannabis and its
various forms as methods to cure other debilitating diseases and pains. Dr. Schuster notes
however that while he intends the trial to serve as a means to provide doctors with the ability
to recommend possible solutions for migraine patients, the trial will not serve as a definitive
answer.“Our goal is to give doctors and patients scientific data to help guide them regarding the use
of cannabis to treat migraine attacks,” Schuster said. “That said, this study won’t answer all
questions about cannabis and migraines, there will still be other important questions to be
studied in the future.”
The trial is ongoing and is currently still looking for interested people to participate.
Interested parties must meet the eligibility criteria such as being between 21 and 65 years of
age and experiencing migraines monthly. Additional criteria are available  here
(https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04360044).
Prior to enrolling, subjects cannot have tested positive for THC or barbiturates, cannot be
pregnant or breastfeeding, and have a current or prior history with cannabis, alcohol,
opioids, or amphetamines. Participants also should not drive a vehicle within four hours of
self-medicating.

Submission: In response to “The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine is
Not a Con  ict, it’s Colonialism”
 June 5, 2021 (https://ucsdguardian.org/2021/06/05/submission-in-response-to-the-ethnic-cleansing-of-palestine-is-not-a-conflict-
its-colonialism/) Guest Writer (https://ucsdguardian.org/author/guestwriter/)
This piece was submitted by UCSD student Benjamin Zaghi.To learn more about The UCSD Guardian's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic,
click here →  (https://ucsdguardian.org/tag/covid-19/)I would like to preface my article by thanking The UCSD Guardian for providing their viewership full
transparency with regards to the previous op-ed relating to the Arab-Israel conflict. I believe it is
imperative that students have a clear and holistic understanding of a story before delving deep into an
article, especially an opinion piece. Unfortunately, the UC San Diego community has been subjected to a
plethora of misinformation which has instigated the spread of bigotry across campus, sometimes under
the cloak of justice. One such example is Zara Irshad’s “revised” op-ed that contains many factual errorsand projects a one-sided narrative.  
Irshad gravely mischaracterizes a violent protest started by a group of Palestinians at the Al-Aqsa
Mosque, and the Israeli response to restore peace and protect worshippers as reason for Hamas to
“protest” by firing rockets into Israel in an attempt to murder Israeli civilians. In the course of two
weeks, Hamas launched over 4,300 rockets  (https://www.haaretz.com/israel-
news/elections/.premium.HIGHLIGHT-11-days-4-340-rockets-and-261-dead-the-israel-gaza-fighting-
in-numbers-1.9836041)  from Gaza into Israel targeting the densely populated cities of Jerusalem, TelAviv, and Be’er Sheva. 
While I too lament the loss of Palestinian lives, it is disingenuous to say Israel “murdered upward of 200
innocent Palestinians.” Irshad fails to mention that Hamas uses civilians as human shields
(https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Pages/Hamas-terrorists-confess-to-using-human-
shields.aspx). They keep their officials, weapons caches, and rocket launch sites near, or in homes
(https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Issues/Pages/Israel-protection-and-Hamas-exploitation-of-
civilians-in-Operation-Protective-Edge-July-2014.aspx), schools
(https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Pages/Hamas-uses-Gaza-schools-for-military-
terrorist-purposes.aspx), and hospitals
(https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Pages/Hamas-uses-hospitals-and-ambulances-for-
military-terrorist-purposes.aspx). In fact, Hamas killed
(https://www.algemeiner.com/2021/05/19/failed-hamas-rockets-have-killed-at-least-20-civilians-in-
gaza-says-israeli-senior-military-officer/) innocent Palestinians in their attempts to kill innocent
Israelis. Israel does everything in its power to limit damage
(https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1395450267055923200) , and warn civilians of an impending attack
(https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/world/middleeast/by-phone-and-leaflet-israeli-attackers-
warn-gazans.html)  by dropping leaflets and sending phone and text messages. In contrast, Hamas, an
internationally recognized terrorist organization that governs the Gaza Strip puts civilians in danger.
Irshad continues her account by comparing Israeli and Palestinian casualties. Many like Irshad say that
“this is not an equal battle”, and to those that make that claim, I pose the question … would it be better if
Israel didn’t defend itself and more innocent Israelis died? She utilizes the number of casualties without
providing any context, ignorantly making a complex conflict into a numbers game. She whitewashes
intifadas as mere “uprisings” when in fact, they were a series of coordinated efforts by Palestinian terror
groups to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible. Even after the recent ceasefire agreement,
representatives from the PFLP, Fatah, and the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces called for“intifada,”  (https://palwatch.org/page/23854?
fbclid=IwAR0gMKzkFKMK1eHnQCjXxWKaYbsdKiT409iY7VmPExtkk29o1Dt7YVXM1wg)  or violence,
and “popular rage” against Israel. 
The ignorance becomes increasingly evident when she states that Israel partakes in “ethnic cleansing.”
This claim is a blatant lie considering that the Palestinian population has increased
(http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/Number-of-Palestinians-in-Occupied-
Palestinian-Territory-in-1948-Selected-Years-ee..html)  every year since 1948. Moreover, if Israel truly
partook in “ethnic cleansing” of Palestinians, why would Israel have taken precautionary measures to
minimize innocent Palestinian casualties?
Irshad continues her one-sided account at the United Nations’ proposed plan in 1947 and the
displacement of over 750,000 Palestinians. Firstly, she fails to mention that the Arab community
rejected the deal, despite receiving more land than the Jews. Secondly, she neglects the fact that the
displacement of “750,000 Palestinians” occurred after five Arab armies began a military campaign todefeat the fledgling Jewish state and ethnically cleanse the Jews from the land. 
Irshad continues her account by comparing Israel’s declaration of independence from Britain’s colonial
rule to the European colonialists’ mistreatment of the indigenous people in America. Firstly, the Jews
have been indigenous to the land of Israel since before the time the land was called Judea
(https://honestreporting.com/origins-judea-israel-
palestine/#:~:text=Founded%20in%20934%20BCE%2C%20the,was%20referred%20to%20as%20Judea.) .
As a result, the establishment of a Jewish state against Britain’s colonial rule was an act of
decolonization, not colonization. The Jews were more than willing to live in peace with the Arabs despite
receiving less land under the proposed UN Partition Plan of 1947– a plan which the Arabs ultimately
rejected, and followed up with the invasion of five Arab armies in an attempt to eliminate the fledgling
Jewish state.
Irshad continues her account by absurdly referring to Israel’s measures to protect its civilians as
“terrorism.” Irshad’s bias is highlighted through her reference to Israel’s self defense as “terrorism” but
Hamas’ terrorist strikes as “protests.” She states that Israel’s airstrikes are “inhumane” and a “form of
religious terrorism toward the Muslim people”. However, she fails to acknowledge that Hamas is the
aggressor, firing thousands of rockets into the holy city of Jerusalem, a city with religious significance to
Jews, Christians, and Muslims. She also fails to mention that Hamas disrespects
(https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Pages/Hamas-uses-holy-places-in-Gaza-as-
terrorist-facilities.aspx) religious places of worship within Gaza using mosques to plan terror attacks,
hide weapons, and launch rockets. Moreover, Israel’s history shows great religious tolerance for all its
people as it fosters a diverse demographic including Jews, Muslims, Christians, Baha’is, and more.
Irshad continues her account by shaming the United States for not supporting the Palestinians.
However, she completely neglects the plethora of aid (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-
56665199)  sent to the Palestinians. She blames the United States, yet she should be blaming thePalestinian leadership and Hamas for ineffectively
(https://www.idf.il/en/minisites/hamas/hamas/hamas-exploitation-of-humanitarian-aid/)  utilizing the
funding which could be used to revive the infrastructure in Gaza.  
Irshad continues her account by falsely stating that “Israeli forces have a history of attacking Palestinians
at holy sites in Islam.” Moreover, she fails to mention that the Temple Mount is actually the holiest site
for Jews, but Israel restricts the place from Jews so that the Muslims can pray at the Dome of the Rock. 
Irshad continues her account by saying that she condemns anti-Semitism, yet I question her sincerity as
she attempts to delegitimize Zionism, ignoring that it is inextricable from Jewish identity
(https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/a-definition-of-zionism) . Zionism is defined as the right for Jews
to self-determine in their ancestral homeland. Zionism is not mutually exclusive with the Palestinian
right to self determination or human rights, in fact Israel has extended many offers to Palestiniansoffering to live in peace as neighbors. 
While Israel’s government is not perfect, it is imperative to be skeptical of her twisted narrative, which
strictly seems to misinform her audiences with the intention to demonize the only Jewish country in theworld. As an opinion editor of a well-read newspaper at UCSD, I expect better! 
I believe it is important that the UCSD community receives an honest assessment of the Arab-Israeli
conflict; this means coming to terms with those who perpetuate violence, hatred, and bigotry. Hamas is
responsible for both the onslaught of rockets and the oppression of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip; to
absolve them of this and shift blame to Israel is dishonest and counterproductive to the goal of a lasting
peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
