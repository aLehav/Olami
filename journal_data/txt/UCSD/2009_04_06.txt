Garret Berg is pretty sure A.S. 
Programming just redeemed itself. 
Less than a year after students slammed his office for orchestrating wha t man y referred to as the dea th  of the Sun God Festival, Berg — current associate vice president of programming — has secured a slew of musicians he said he feels certain will inject new life into the annual festival.
Taking the main stage will be 
alternative hip-hop troupe N.E.R.D., followed by bearded folk-rocker Iron and Wine. Engineer turned sweaty dancehall hipster Girl Talk will headline the festival’s dance tent, a massive deejay-oriented enclosure to be located in the north-east corner of RIMAC Field. 
The three top acts will be accom-
panied by Motion City Soundtrack, Sara Bareilles, Augustana, the Cool Kids, Grand Old Party, Rootbeer, DJ Nu-Mark of Jurassic 5, Anavan and Nosaj Thing. Also working the stage will be Battle of the Bands winner, the Theory of Funkativity. 
Cirque Berzerk — a contempo-
rary dance  group that re-imagines traditional circus performances by incorporating elements of punk rock, risque burlesque and horror-flick fantasy — will return this year for a full day of performances. Los Angeles-based comedians in the Upright Citizens Brigade are sched-uled to perform throughout the day. Both attractions will be located on the midway, a canopied stage to be located in the center of RIMAC Field. 
“We couldn’t be happier with the 
lineup right now, ” Berg said. “We have diversity, we have big name acts — we think we really have something for everyone. It should be pretty phenomenal. ”
Working with a total festival 
budget of approximately $550,000, Berg’s office sought to secure  big-name artists by booking fewer sec-ondary acts, pumping nearly one-third of the Sun God budget — a move inspired by student criticism of last year’s lineup.
“What we heard from last year 
was ‘Enough of the small bands, we want that money spent on bigger acts, ’” Berg said. “We really listened to that feedback and got rid of some of those smaller acts and tried to re-orient stuff to the bigger acts. ”
He said a great deal of atten-
tion went into securing acts that would appeal to a wider range of students than rapper Sean Kingston and rockers Coheed and Cambria, who performed last year.
“If you put this side by side with 
Revised festival will 
facilitate re-entry to RIMAC with streamlined wristband distribution.

This week, as students cast 
their TritonLink ballots for next 
year’s A.S. Council, they will be using the Single Transferable Vote system, which allows vot-ers  to rank A.S. executive and academic-division senator can-didates in order of preference. 
Although STV was imple-
mented in 2007, this is the first A.S. election it will impact because last year’s races were largely unopposed — and there are still a few kinks in the sys-tem.
Under  STV , in the event that 
a student’s first-choice candi-date receives the fewest votes, that vote will be transferred to the student’s second-choice candidate; and so on, until any one candidate achieves simple majority with 50 percent plus one vote. 
According to Associate Vice 
President of Athletic Relations Peter Benesch, the council switched to the STV system to encourage greater involvement in elections. Councilmembers felt students would be more inclined to vote for independent candidates if their votes would be transferred in the event of a loss, and that independent can-didates would be more inclined to run for office if they felt stu-dents wouldn’t be deterred from supporting them.
At UCSD, STV voting will 
only be used to determine races in which candidates compete for one position. All races other than those for the four execu-tive offices and academic-divi-sion senate seats will continue to be decided by the standard plurality system. Because candi-dates in those races will be com-peting for multiple spots — for instance, eight slots in the case of campuswide senator — the vote transfer becomes less clear. 
“It’s easier to abuse the 
system in these larger races, ” Benesch said. He cited cases of strategic lobbying at UC Berkeley, where candidates on larger slates campaign for specific rankings in order to manipulate a more favorable transfer of votes.

The budget crisis spread to Price 
Center last Tuesday, when UCSD Bookstore and Perks Coffee Shop  
unveiled new business hours. Vice Chancellor of Business Affairs Steven Relyea attributed the changes to the nation’s current economic downturn. 
Previously, the bookstore’s hours 
were 8 a.m. to  8 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and noon to 6  p.m. on Sunday. The hours have been changed to 8 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and noon to 5 p.m. on weekends.
The coffee shop’s hours used to 
be 7 a.m. to  9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and noon to 7 p.m. on Sunday. The hours have been changed to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and noon to 5 p.m on Saturday and Sunday.
Additionally, prices of products 
that have not sold well — main-ly electronics and apparel — have continued to drop since a gener-al downtrend in purchases began in November, UCSD Bookstore Director  John Turk said. 
The bookstore has managed to 
break even by decreasing expen-ditures at about the same 3.5 per-cent rate at which sales have waned since November, and has avoided filling 12 career employee vacan-cies — along with 15 student posi-tion vacancies — in an attempt to cut costs. 
Though no employees have been 
laid off due to the cutback in hours,  three cashiers have been moved to the bookstore-owned Sunshine Market, which has maintained normal hours.

Students participating in independent candidate Utsav Gupta’s presidential campaign prepare 
posters bearing the candidate’s slogans in Price Center Plaza on April 5.

Senior Staff Writer
Election week is finally here, 
and candidates are crossing their 
fingers after a month of fierce campaigning that included visits to student organizations, appeals to college councils and weeks of mingling with potential constitu-ents in an effort to secure the student vote.
Perhaps the most anxious of 
these candidates are the three pres-idential hopefuls: Erin Brodwin of Student Voice!, Adam Teitelbaum of the Clean Slate and independent candidate Utsav Gupta.
Addressing issues of college 
affordability, campus life and student involvement in coun-cil affairs, Brodwin, Gupta and Teitelbaum sought to paint a pic-ture of a more perfect student-governing body.
Students can vote on 
TritonLink all this week. Polls close Friday,  April 10 at 4 p.m.

manager Frank Carroll, because 
withdrawn candidates couldn’t be removed from the ballot due to programming issues on TritonLink, they could impact the election results in STV races. Votes for with-drawn candidates are disregarded in plurality races, but because of STV’s ranking system, they could potentially affect final numbers.
“We don’t really know the impli-
cations, ” Carroll said. “[Withdrawn candidates] could take votes away from a third-place candidate … It could screw up who [would] actu-ally win. ”
However, in the event that a 
withdrawn candidate garners enough votes to knock another candidate out of the race — thus influencing the transfer of votes and election results — Carroll said the elections committee could deter-mine the proper STV winner by hand. 
“There’s no doomsday scenario 
except that it would be a pain in the butt, ” he said. 
Carroll also hopes to adjust the 
election code so it remains consis-tent with university policy in the future. Currently, “dorm storming” — going door-to-door through the resident halls to solicit students — is forbidden by university policy, but is left out of the election code. Because of this discrepancy, griev-ances regarding dorm storming are technically illegitimate. However, Carroll made a special ruling on March 31 that forbade the prac-tice, and will entertain grievances should any violations occur.

Local rock group the Theory of Funkativity won Battle of the Bands at the Loft on April 4, securing a spot in the lineup of thi s year’s Sun God Festival.The bookstore has significantly 
dropped prices for electronics and 
apparel and temporarily decreased inventory by lowering the amount of products and increasing the fre-quency of purchases. This allows the bookstore to buy at discount from its vendors while better meet-ing the rate of student demand. 
“The breadth is the same but the 
depth is less, ” Turk said.
The ripple effects of a failing 
economy have caused a general decline in depart-ment spending at the bookstore, a major source for faculty electron-ics, Turk said. 
While Turk 
said he noticed an increase in school spirit over the last few years, students are buying fewer logoed products — such as hooded sweatshirts — indicating not a loss in interest, but less financial freedom to act upon it.
“We want to make sure to do 
everything we can to provide a lower price during difficult eco-nomic times, but we need to know if the customers coming to the book-store have stopped buying and still browse or have stopped coming, ” Turk said. “They’re still coming and they’re still shopping, but they’re not buying as much. ”
Unlike the bookstore, Perks 
Coffee Shop  and the Sunshine 
Market are currently receiving more business than before the reces-sion forced students to cut back on spending. The coffee shop’s  sched-
ule changes primarily reflect greater economy with the bookstore and learning to match peak demand hours for its clientele. 
Since the bookstore has a gen-
eral history of steady growth, Turk 
said he expects this setback to be tem-porary. Despite a drop in freshman enrollment, Turk is hopeful that the construction of on-campus housing will bolster sales at the bookstore. Because students in the dorms spend more per capita than 
those living off campus, Turk said he expects demand to rise. 
The reduced hours will continue 
through the summer. In July, Turk will consult with university officials about Fall Quarter hours — which, 
once decided, will go into effect by mid-September.

hbecker@ucsd.edu.last year’s lineup, it’s a world of dif-ference, ” Berg said. “We feel that there’s truly something for everyone, and we’ve kind of thrown that phrase around in the past. But this year, from the beginning, we looked at every slot and said ‘What can we do with this?  Who  can we hit here?’”
The addition of the dance tent was 
inspired by the recent surge in popu-larity of the Fall Quarter  all-campus 
dance, a trend that Berg hoped to capitalize on by introducing a more dance-oriented aspect into the festi-val’s attractions. Aside from perfor-mances by Girl Talk, DJ Nu-Mark and a handful of other deejay acts, the tent will also feature daytime per-formances by members of the Deejay and Vinylphiles Club. 
The festival will feature two sepa-
rate vendor fairs: student-run booths along the west end of RIMAC Field and a string of commercial vendors on Hopkins Drive. 
Berg is also in talks with the Loft 
to set up a film, music and art show-case of “Loft experience, ” though plans are still in the early stages.
The programming office also 
worked to dramatically overhaul the festival’s wristband distribution sys-tem. This year, wristbands will be distributed on the day of the event at a designated check-in area consist-ing of 24 different waiting lines near the festival’s Ridge Walk entrance, a change that Berg hopes will stream-line the process. 
 “Students don’t have to worry 
about wristbands until the day of the festival, ” Berg said. “We’re basically going to run it like an airport and try get people through as quickly as possible. ”
Re-entry to RIMAC Field will be 
permitted at any time throughout he 12-hour festival.
Berg said his department is work-
ing to create an additional series of Sun God-related activities in the week lead-ing up to the main event, geared toward anticipation and expanding Sun God excitement beyond the confines of RIMAC Field. Though plans for these events have yet to be solidified, Berg said they would likely include noon-time concerts in a centralized area such as Price Center Plaza.
“We want to have an atmosphere 
around campus that is different from your typical week, ” Berg said. “Basically, transforming the campus … so that when you walk outside your dorm, you know it’s Sun God. ”

The most important question 
on the A.S. ballot has no easy answer.
Though three eager candidates 
have given this year’s race to the A.S. presidency a much-needed jolt of competition — after current Student Voice! President Donna Bean ran unopposed last spring — the 2009-10 hopefuls are nothing to shout about.
SV! puppet Erin Brodwin, the 
current associate vice president of local affairs, is the surest public speaker of the bunch. At the mid-day presidential debate last week in Price Center, she succinctly laid down what appeared to be a well-conceived plan to stand firm against the administration on con-cerns like protecting free speech, the Literature Building cancer cluster and the Sun God Festival’s welfare, meanwhile promising to iron out the council’s tendency to bicker. 
But off the podium, Brodwin is 
guarded — difficult to get a hold of and rattling off the same intan-gible talking points in conversation. Despite her self-pledged devotion to fighting amplified sound zones in UCSD’s current speech policy, she and the other two student represen-tatives appointed to the committee currently redrafting the policy have taken no steps to contact the admin-istrators with ultimate control over each zone. She also doesn’t think A.S. enterprises like the Grove Caffe should surpass self-sustainability to bring in a profit, basically defying the entire purpose of an enterprise.
On the other hand, Adam 
Tietelbaum — former Alpha Epsilon Phi president and frontman to the peppy Clean Slate — is approach-able, clear-headed and ridiculously nice. However, he’s unaware of the bureaucratic mess he’ll be taking on, instead focusing on all the fun-and-games student-life ideas like an A.S. screen name and Facebook account that running mate Stephanie Usry already has a more ambitious grasp on — and could probably handle with her left pinky. 
Though he cites challenging the 
alcohol policy as an important step to revamp the Sun God Festival, he hasn’t demonstrated an essential understanding of how any of these policies could be challenged, nor outlined the ins and outs of the system — necessary steps in nego-tiating with higher-ups. Tietelbaum lacks an effective president’s crucial familiarity with what it would take to bend university policy — some-thing he claims could be remedied by holding a grown-up conversation with administrators. If that was a viable solution, Bear Gardens would be Beer Gardens and there’ d be 50 at the Sun God Festival alone. 
That isn’t to say Utsav Gupta, 
running independently after fail-ing to receive SV! support, won’t likewise be trampled by the mon-ey-minded suits up top. He’s soft-spoken and inoffensive — a general people-pleaser. 
But after three years of A.S. 
involvement, he can tell you exactly how to structure a task force that has some hopes of traversing the red tape. His initial intentions to run on the cursed SV! slate were allegedly in hopes of saving it from its “darker side, ” restoring the bigger-picture principles of 2006-07 president Harry Khanna (whom Gupta essen-tially worships) with the invalu-able guiding light of institutional memory.
“We’ve become this kind of legis-
lative bureaucracy that passes poli-cies that don’t affect anybody but ourselves, ” he said.
While Brodwin’s only goal is to 
redecorate the ship (and Tietelbaum would spend two quarters just try-ing to find the helm), Gupta is determined to turn it around and start again. He’s overflowing with all the right ideas — a weekly Y ouTube address, a Bear Garden at the Sun God Festival, a plan to rally packs of passionate students to pressure administrators — even though he’s probably way too busy (and nice) to see them all through.
But there’s something to be said 
for optimism. Sure, as current AVP of student organizations, he hard-ly speaks at meetings and shows absolutely no history of facilitat-ing the flow of communication he now advocates. And his dream for a UCSD football team is almost as farfetched as it is nauseatingly expensive. 
Thing is, in the land of the blind, 
the one-eyed man is king.
There’s no denying it: Stephanie Usry in an excep-tional leader. That much is 
clear from speaking with just about anyone running for office next year. “I feel like she could have run for president, ” one Student Voice! campuswide senator candidate said. Whether they be SV!, Clean Slate or independent, the major-ity of candidates mentioned Usry by name as someone they look forward to working with next year — and a good portion said she’s responsible for their own interest in student government.
Although Usry took a hiatus 
from council politics this year, she remains entrenched in UCSD stu-dent life, maintaining a sophisti-cated understanding of A.S. dynam-ics. But rather than getting bogged down in the petty fuss that’s been so detrimental to the current council, Usry is energetic and forward think-ing. Her approach to the office of student life lies in small, manageable changes that add up to make a big impact on students. And although she has ambitious goals for next year, she’s armed with a thoughtful and meticulous game plan.
Unlike her opponent, Usry’s 
passionate about committee work — often the place where real changes are made — recognizing the most effective way to facilitate campus improvement. She’s also practical about what doesn’t work, noting that A.S. resolutions, which have dominated council attention this year, are ultimately words without action and currently lack meaningful followup.
But perhaps most importantly, 
she understands the big picture. She’ll be able to protect student interests when working with administrators on projects like the Sun God Festival because she knows when and how to com-promise effectively. Her extensive familiarity with the nuances of UCSD bureaucracy and her abil-ity to see the forest through the trees make her a successful leader, capable of making a measurable impact for the better on student life next year. Now if only she’ d run for president.

CAMPUSWIDE SENATORSVICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCE AND RESOURCES
There is no one more quali-
fied than Peter Benesch to be next year’s vice president 
of finance and resources. He has worked diligently on the A.S. finance committee this year alongside cur-rent incumbent Naasir Lakhani to ensure a seamless transition period. But more importantly, he has infused the committee with an enthusiasm and thirst for efficiency — work-ing to improve the state of council spending this year.
As the current associate vice pres-
ident of athletic relations, Benesch has often been a voice of reason, providing a much-needed histori-cal perspective to the self-involved council. His personal interest and attention to detail spans well beyond his job description, and his extensive knowledge of the council’s recent history should be applauded.
Benesch knows the council’s 
dependency on student fees desper-ately needs to change, and unlike other candidates he has concrete plans to start the process. In addition to finally giving A.S. enterprises — such as the failing Grove Caffe — the attention they deserve to start turn-ing a profit, Benesch is interested in pursuing a new A.S. Store. Although other candidates have piggybacked this idea, Benesch is the only one who’s done the research to form a responsible, feasible plan to make that goal a reality. He also plans to lighten the council’s financial burden with tasteful sponsorships at council events like Bear Gardens.
Not only will Benesch make an 
excellent vice president, he will be exactly the kind of councilmember those Wednesday meetings need. He will bring a momentum for improvement to his position, finally weaning the council off its student-fee addiction, and a refreshing atmosphere of competence to the council floor.

As the only candidate running for vice presi-dent of External Affairs, 
Gracelynne West has already won. But that doesn’t mean she has any idea what she’ll do once in office. Judging by her inability to form concrete plans or original ideas for how to approach her job, this campus is in for a year of ineffec-tual outreach and meek legislative lobbying.
West has focused on increasing 
diversity at the university while ensuring that college affordability remains a legislative priority. Her plans for achieving these goals? It’s hard to tell because West appears to have difficulty express-ing her ideas, often stumbling over her words in attempting to describe her stances on important issues. 
It’s difficult to imagine anyone 
so unassuming and inarticulate as West displaying the type of gung-ho spirit and hardnosed position-taking necessary to rep-resent our university within any serious political arena.
When she does speak up, 
West offers unoriginal solutions to complex problems that have plagued our university for years. Asked how she intends to increase diversity at UCSD, West harps on strategies of “outreaching to students. ” Questioned about her ability to lobby for the California D.R.E.A.M. Act and the California College Affordability Act, West points to her success in register-ing students to vote in the 2008 presidential election. How those things are related remains to be determined, but West assumes that every student she helped to register automatically became a D.R.E.A.M. Act supporter. 
Unless West has some Jedi-like 
powers of persuasion she has yet to reveal, not much is going to happen in the External Affairs office next year.

0ITTOn a slate whose goals are constantly distracted by internal bickering, Katie Hall isn’t afraid to criticize this year’s self-interested council and stand up for 
the student body’s best interests. That’s why when council-members refused to run a referendum that could have gath-ered sorely needed funding for the Loft, Hall recognized its value to students — despite its ties to university administra-tion — and dissented.“I think the students are smart enough to make their own decisions, ” she said.
Hall’s pledge to focus on improving already-existing pro-
grams shows she recognizes the limitations of a 10-month term, but that doesn’t mean she lacks ambitious goals for next year. Besides hoping to keep the Loft afloat, Hall plans to bring programs she’s worked hard on as a Revelle College senator — like career-development seminars for humanities majors  — to the greater campus. And just to make sure she’s giving you what you want, she’ll be pushing for more online forums where students can voice their opinions.

<PWUI[Carli Thomas dreams of an A.S. Council that does more than just show up for meetings. But her emphasis on accountability and her ability to set 
and accomplish goals puts her ahead of the pack. Thomas wants to institutionalize communication within the A.S. Council’s framework, so councilmembers know what they need to do, when and why.
And her track record proves she can make it happen. 
In her current position as a Thurgood Marshall College senator, Thomas’ excellent attendance and meaningful contributions at A.S. Council meetings are more than gold stars — they demonstrate her commitment to both councils, facilitate communication and help keep both parties informed. 
Even her work on the upcoming “Know Y our Rights” 
campaign — something she hopes to offer throughout all three quarters next year — shows she’s listening to students and working to meet their needs.

8MVIA pimped-out campus calendar and free Doritos on finals week are all fine and dandy, but the coun-cil needs at least one (competent) member who 
remembers there’s a world of hurt beyond the eucalyptus grove. Unlike many unfocused Student Voice! candidates pushing the same-old minority/diversity/culture aware-ness package, Earl Warren College councilmember Bryant Pena has a cause — and a plan. He wants to unify campus philanthropy groups into “almost a UN panel” that would meet monthly, streamlining their efforts by redirecting to increase overall efficiency.
He also appreciates that your average 20-unit stress case 
will need more than a photocopied flyer to care. “Tupac taught Biggie this idea where you make a hit and it gets people to listen to the rest of your album, ” Pena said. Cue the hip-hop awareness events, indie film screenings and strategically placed anti-admin flyers; Pena’s got you on lock.

3MV_WZ\PaUnlike the cliquish squabblers currently drawing A.S. meetings into the wee hours, Eleanor Roosevelt College councilmember Adam Kenworthy knows 
we’re all in this together. Along with bringing representatives from the Student Center co-ops into A.S. negotiations, he prioritizes patching things up with the student organizations alienated by past councils.
“If you’re not on an org on good terms with A.S., you’re 
kind of left out of the loop, ” he said.
Kenworthy also has a grasp on what it takes to reach out 
to students — aka, more than enlarging the A.S. logo on event flyers. He wants to hold more frequent town-hall forums for students unwilling to sit throug h tedious council meetings, 
open a voicemail hotline to be updated weekly with campus event info and establish a committee dedicated to gauging effective ways of gathering student input. 
Even more important: He’s pretty much into doing what-
ever Stephanie Usry wants to do.

>]After nearly two years of involvement in both the A.S. Council and Student Council at Eleanor Roosevelt College, Alex Vu has an acute under-
standing of the intricacies of college politics and an ability to gauge his constituents’ needs. 
In speaking with Vu, it becomes clear that he has not 
taken his service to the student body lightly. He demon-strates an ability to pinpoint issues of importance not only within the context of his own work but also within the larger scope of A.S. activity, suggesting well-informed strategies for how to better integrate college councils with the A.S. Council while offering concrete goals to improve campus spirit among students. 
Vu is new to the A.S. Finance Committee, but has already 
developed knowledge of the means necessary to efficiently allocate council funds. He promised to use his time as a sena-tor to improve upon this allocation process, a promise that he appears likely to honor given his interest in the field. The A.S. ballot will allow students to vote for their top eight choices for campuswide sena-tor. However — after a run of disheartening 
interviews with candidates either unaware of their own platforms or unable to locate the Student Center altogether — we can only express confidence in the following five.
One or more of the nine unendorsed candidates 
expressed that: cancer awareness was his biggest concern, yet he was unaware of the cancer cluster at the Literature Building; Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
makes a million dollars a year; free speech is something you can “do;” students would be down to listen to podcasts of eight-hour A.S. meetings while at the beach; UCSD spends $700 million each year on public transportation; it is the right of the A.S. Council to seize land from the university without reimbursement; trusting one’s gut and friends is the most reliable way to make decisions on council; Grove Caffe Manager Cleveland Thomas runs 
the entire Student Center; Student Affirmative Action Committee organizations are under-represented on the council.Has vision and knowledge to cut 
dependence on student fees.RESPONSIBILITIES

Dear Editor,
I read with interest the April 2 
Guardian  editorial concerning the 
effect of the world financial crisis on 
market-based appointments at the University of California. I appreci-ate the student perspective, and I encourage all members of the UCSD community to look carefully at the most recent explanatory newsletter from UC President Mark Yudof:
www.universityofcalifornia.edu/
news/ouruniversity/04_09/welcome.html.
In that letter, President Yudof sets 
out clearly the many steps taken on each of the campuses and in the Office of the President to deal with this serious fiscal challenge. Positive suggestions on how to better achieve necessary fiscal discipline would be most welcome.
— Marye Anne Fox 
Chancellor
Dear Editor,
As the world continues to change 
at a fast pace, people in the United States should constantly adapt to the changes. The current economic downturn reveals the greed and cor-ruption in the financial industry. Therefore, ethics should become the top issue of American education. Ethics is the main focus of both Chinese literature and philosophy. In fact, Chinese literature pursues peace, wisdom, virtue, beauty and prosperity that can be applied to daily life. The quality of a nation’s literature relies on how the govern-ment treats its writers. The Chinese government had sponsored talented writers from 100 B.C. to 1910 A.D. It not only provided schools and libraries to educate them, but also offered them government positions. This unique way to reward writ-ers in world history made Chinese writers create the best literature and philosophy in the world. China has also become the major debtor of the United States. 
The close relationship in this 
small world demands deep mutu-al understanding. However, the American public’s knowledge of Chinese culture is limited to Bruce Lee’s movies and egg rolls. The courses in Chinese offered in the U.S. universities are limited to con-versations such as greetings and asking directions. The media in the United States has sent Chinese-Americans to China to gather mate-rial. Due to its lack of background in Chinese culture, its research link-ing the East to the West culminates in the discovery of the connection between fortune cookies and lottery numbers.
Frankly speaking, China’s 
strength does not lie in its weaponry, its space technology, the leadership of its politicians or its economic power from exports, but rather in the legacy of moral courage found in the works of Chinese poets, writers and philosophers. 
Raising the level of understand-
ing of Chinese culture requires access to good translations. However, there are too few resources and qualified people in this field to meet such an enormous demand. In order to eliminate distrust and misunder-standings due to cultural differences, help fellow Americans adjust to the fast-changing world and preserve America’s leadership of the world community, it is important that the American media have a plan to sys-tematically introduce Chinese cul-ture to the American public.

CANDIDATES
2009-10
As an A.S. novice, Adam Teitelbaum anchors his presidential 
campaign not in starting policy and programming efforts from scratch — as his Clean Slate affiliation suggests — 
but in finding a middle ground between student wants and the administration’s demands. This rookie believes he has the bird’s eye view to find that paradise. 
“[I’m] going to be able to look at any issue or budget and say, 
‘Y ou know what? From an outside perspective, that doesn’t make sense, and it doesn’t seem efficient, ”’ Teitelbaum said. 
With a driving slate motto of “It’s what you make of it, and 
we’re here to help, ” Teitelbaum proposes updating current pub-licity methods such as Facebook with new features in order to ensure student involvement in council decisions and policy revi-sions, as well as A.S. events. 
“We’re not going to put our Facebook profiles on private, 
and we’re going to use things like Twitter, AIM accounts and Facebook so students are writing the A.S. agenda, and A.S. doesn’t write the students’ agenda, ” he said. 
As of press time, Teitelbaum’s Facebook profile was set to private. 
Teitelbaum said TritonLink could be 
an especially valuable tool, and suggested pop-up ads for campus news and events that would appear while students wait to access their information. 
From a functional standpoint, Teitelbaum’s rec-
ommendations are feasible, but administrators must “determine if [students] will be annoyed by constant ads, ” Director of Electronic Communications Beth Surrell said. 
Current A.S. President Donna Bean said student input is 
achieved most effectively through council representatives who visit student organization meetings. 
“ Adam is absolutely unqualified, [with] no expectations [and] 
no goals, ” she said.
Teitelbaum has expressed his support of “free-speech zones, ” 
which many believe to be unconstitutional. He proposed the CLEAN SLATE

Utsav Gupta has been eyeing the A.S. presidency since before he set foot on this campus. As an incoming freshman in the summer of 2006, he called then-president and Student Voice! 
slate founder Harry Khanna to express his enthusiasm for student government. 
Before long, Gupta had become a Khanna protege, tagging 
along on lunch dates with student organizations and taking notes on his every move. 
The young politico went on to spend nearly three years with 
the Student Voice! slate. Now, after being denied his slate’s presi-dential bid, Gupta is relying on his own merit — and institutional memory — to draw the independent vote.
Gupta’s main priorities include uncaging the Sun God Festival 
from RIMAC Field, freezing tuition and redefining the council as an inclusive body that represents all UCSD students.
Gupta will be the first to tell you that his platform is ambitious. 
His goals, he said, will be accomplished by galvanizing an increas-ingly stagnant A.S. Council.
“ Ambition, especially in a student government, is what we need at this point in time, ” he said. “I don’t think it’s fair to the student body to always cam-paign on short-term measures. We need to con-tinue moving forward instead of moving sideways. ”
In order to spread the Sun God Festival back across 
campus, Gupta said he intends to reintroduce elements that existed prior to 2008 — such as a daytime stage in Price Center and a line of student-organization booths on Library Walk. 
Current AVP of Programming Garrett Berg said this plan is 
unrealistic, considering the occupancy of these areas. Last year, over 20,000 wristbands were sold for the event.
“The festival, as big as it was last year, could never exist in those 
venues, ” he said.
Despite administrative concerns that spreading the festival  
back out would endanger students and raise security costs, Gupta is confident that by collaborating with college councils to promote college-specific events during the festival, crowds 
See GUPTA page 9Erin Brodwin is running on the Student Voice! slate — and she won’t let you forget it.
An Eleanor Roosevelt College junior with 
a year of experience as associate vice president 
of local affairs, Brodwin touts the pillars of the 
Student Voice! — student empowerment,  access 
and affordability and campus community — with 
the sureness of an experienced politician. 
Brodwin emphasized her ability to build rela-
tionships with administrators, legislators and diverse 
student organizations. She said she hopes to stay true 
to these pillars through relentless meetings with student 
organizations and college councils, and by encouraging 
student input through campaigns on Library Walk. 
As AVP of local affairs, one of Brodwin’s biggest projects 
was to help organize the external and local-affairs lobby corps, which lobbied lawmakers in Sacramento earlier this year. 
“ At the student conference in Sacramento, we sent students and met representatives and discussed the need for decreas-ing student fees, ” Brodwin said. “We successfully made sure the proposed fee increase of 10 percent was significantly reduced [to 7.3 percent] and we hope to do something like that again. ”
Brodwin said she hopes to institutionalize the student 
lobby corps and put continued pressure on lawmakers and the UC Board of Regents to keep student fees as low as possible. She plans to participate in the large student presence at the May regents meeting — which will take place at UCSD — to protest further student-fee increases.
“When student fees go up, it puts the burden of taxes on 
the backs of students, targeting underrepresented communi-ties, ” Brodwin said. “ As far as I’m concerned, education is a right. ”
Brodwin also said a satisfactory free-speech policy is one 
of her top concerns, and has worked as an undergraduate stu-

use of permits to ensure that protestors secure administrative 
approval (though he adamantly opposes discrimination in permit allocation based on content). 
“If [students] want to be at work in the library or classroom and 
don’t want to bothered, they shouldn’t be bothered, ” Teitelbaum said.
In the case of an impromptu protest, he suggested establishing 
a hotline for protestors to contact the police department or the vice chancellor of student affairs’ office in order to obtain verbal approval. 
Teitelbaum’s vision of the Sun God Festival takes a similar middle 
-ground approach on student safety. He cites two reasons why the event will never return to its original format: the administration and police department. 
Though he initially expressed that returning to an “uncaged” 
Sun God Festival would be impossible, Teitelbaum now advocates returning the festival to an all-campus format by “advocating for the revision of the current alcohol policy. ” He would like to see alcohol-related sponsorship for events like Bear Gardens, which would cut funding costs for the A.S. Council, cover outlay for heightened security and provide an incentive for of-age students to attend campus events. He hasn’t yet spoken with administrators about the policy.
A.S. Associate Vice President of Programming Garrett Berg said 
doubling back to Sun God’s all-campus format would diminish the festival’s longevity. 
“We want Sun God to be campus community and festival first, 
and if there’s alcohol there, it’s a smaller part of it, ” Berg said. 
As president of Alpha Epsilon Pi last year, Teitelbaum banned 
drug use during chapter events by revising the fraternity constitu-tion to include punishments for violators, such as suspension from the fraternity. Although the decision drew much opposition, current president Joey Lipton-Schwartz said enforcement has been offset by the fraternity’s inability to prevent drug use outside of brotherhood activities.
Teitelbaum also served as Eleanor Roosevelt College’s housing 
and dining committee representative for two years, where he dealt with policy revisions including a student fee increase from $1,800 to $2,700. Teitelbaum blames the fee hikes on the escalating price of providing housing and dining services, and put the amount in perspective by comparing it to La Jolla’s high living costs.
Teitelbaum said his ability to adjust housing and dining policies 
under real-world hurdles will translate to the A.S. presidency in that he would need to incorporate shifting variables like the economic downturn into council decisions. And although he admits his blan-ket ideas will not solve all campus issues, he believes he can put a fresh perspective to redirecting policies and programming toward students’ interests.

dent representative on the campus committee to revise 
the free speech policy.
Although Brodwin said it would be ideal to have no 
policy at all, she is working with administrators. 
“I consistently was honest and told [the A.S. coun-
cil] how I was feeling and that the students were being marginalized and the administration was being over-represented, ” Brodwin said.
Although the committee’s meetings are public record, 
Brodwin emphasized that having the minutes e-mailed out to committee members has been one of her most significant achievements on the committee. 
To increase student input at council meetings, 
Brodwin said she plans to reorganize the A.S. Forum in hopes this will make the environment less intimidating — so that the council and the public are parallel.
She also suggested moving A.S. council meetings, 
which are currently held on the fourth floor of Price Center East, to a more recognizable location and rear-ranging furniture to better facilitate discussion.
According to current A.S. President Donna Bean, 
however, the current organization of the council floor is the only way it logistically makes sense.
“We’ve had student input continuously throughout 
the year, regardless of the way the room is set up, ” Bean said. “I don’t think changing the location away from the A.S. offices makes any sense. We used to have it in Price Center Ballroom, which was even more intimidating. We could maybe have it in a different location once a quarter, but I don’t think moving the meeting is going to do anything. Move yourself downstairs and educate people and let them know where the meeting is. ”
Though Brodwin has expressed that candidate Ustav 
Gupta’s plan to “uncage” Sun God is unrealistic, the Student Voice! Web site promises to “bring back an uncaged Sun God!”
Brodwin said she hopes to improve future Sun God 
Festivals and programming events by increasing student input on booking decisions, making sure the headlining artists are committed early. 
Overall, Brodwin said she hopes that her experiences 
on the A.S. council will help her overcome administra-tive hurdles, and that her efforts to reach out to students will create a student body that is more involved and engaged.
“Coming down to students instead of having the stu-
dents come to us is one of my main goals, ” Brodwin said.

will disperse and no single location will become too densely occupied. 
He added that making colleges feel more invested in the Sun God 
Festival would help repair relations between the A.S. Council and college 
councils that have deteriorated in recent years.
“We’ve seen a cutting of ties in the past few years, ” he said. “We 
reduced their representation and funding, and now we don’t even try to 
reach out to them for things like the referendum. We just go ahead and do it and ask for their vote. ”
Gupta also proposed a Bear Garden on the day of the Sun God 
Festival to provide space for legal, cont ained drinking and to discourage 
drunk driving to the festival from off-campus housing.
A veteran of Khanna’s and Marco Murillo’s presidential offices, Gupta 
was elected A.S. all-campus senator in 2007, and has served on the Sixth College Council since 2006.
As an all-campus senator, he worked with the Berkeley-based 
Greenlining Institute to gather signatures for the Students for Tuition Relief Now! campaign, which supported the same legislation that is now before the California Assembly as the College Affordability Act. The bill stipulates a five-year tuition freeze at UC and CSU campuses.
In his role as A.S. associate vice president of student organizations 
this year, Gupta said he has worked to secure funds for organizations with unique priorities not covered by the event-based funding process.
These organizations include the Players, a theater group that recently 
requested funding for props, and Books for Prisoners, whose primary expense is postage. 
He also helped publicize the effects of last quarter’s student activity-
fee referendum on student-organization funding. 
But on the council floor, Gupta is quiet, and councilmembers have 
suggested he does not engage with student organizations or report back to the council as actively as he should.
A.S. President Donna Bean said she worries that Gupta’s academics 
and his editorial position at the Sixth Sense  newspaper have undermined 
his council work.
“ A majority of the time, [Vice President of Finance Naasir Lakhani] 
has had to pick up his slack, ” she said. “He is overstretched. ”
Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator Alex Vu, who works with Gupta 
on the finance committee, expressed a similar concern.
“I’ve had to pick up a lot of slack from the AVP of student orgs, ” he 
said.
Gupta said that partisanship in the council has been detrimental to 
the working environment.
“Student Voice! has become something very introspective, ” he said. 
“ A.S. is all about Student Voice!, and I’m running to bring A.S. back to the entire student body. ”
He said he has received little direction from Bean, and Lakhani has 
not responded to his phone calls or e-mails in recent weeks.
Lakhani declined to comment on Gupta’s performance this year.

“Big Three” experiment in Oakland. 
If Braden fares well against the Angels’ lineup, Opening Day will be consid-ered a success. My guess is that Braden will struggle early — as will the A ’s this season. Oakland is still one year away from contention.
With the Nos. 1 and 2 starters 
injured, Joe Saunders takes the mound, facing Oakland’s re-tooled lineup. Los Angeles hasn’t changed much from last season, and after winning 100 games, they didn’t have to. The fate of the Angels depends on how much the offseason moves of Oakland and Texas come to light. If the Angels’ No. 3 start-er can handle an A ’s lineup that is no longer a complete disaster, Los Angeles is well on its way to a three-peat. 
Brewers at Giants
When I went home to the Bay 
Area over winter break, I picked up 
the sports page after the Giants signed veteran starter Randy Johnson and got a kick out of the headline “Johnson makes Giants a Contender. ” Seriously, a team that has been abysmal for the past few seasons because of its repeated signings of players who should have retired already adds another old guy and you call it a contender?
But the NL West may just be medi-
ocre enough to vault the Giants into contention after all. Tim Lincecum is leading the way, and their starting pitching is stellar — Barry Zito fills out San Francisco’s fourth spot (where he belongs) instead of second or third like in past seasons. Still, for the Giants to go anywhere this season, the team’s young hitters, such as Pablo Sandoval, will have to prove themselves. Who better to start against than the Brewers’ terrible rotation?

▶ PEANUTS, MYVTWHNLTRITONS SET PROGRAM RECORD FOR WINS
By Cameron Tillisch
Staff Writer
MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — With a 
sweep of the University of Pacific (30-19, 30-22, 30-24) on April 3 at RIMAC Arena, the No. 10 Tritons (11-13, 7-12 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) set school records this week in both the number of overall program wins and conference wins in a season. The Tritons kicked off their final home stand in fashion, marking their most successful season in conference play. 
“It was an awesome feeling and 
validating knowing how hard we’ve worked, ” redshirt sophomore out-side hitter Will Ehrman said. “We’ve improved every year since I’ve been here. ”
Following their historic win, the 
Tritons took on No. 5 Stanford looking to continue their conference success, but lost in four sets (30-26, 21-30, 30-26, 30-25).
“We played Stanford really tight but 
in the end, they kicked it into another gear, ” Ehrman said. “They served a tougher game than us and wanted it more on defense. ”
Despite junior opposite hitter 
Frank Fritsch’s efforts, including a match-high 22 kills on .378 hitting, the Cardinal (19-8, 12-6 MPSF) over-powered the Tritons, outhitting them at an overall clip of .413, compared to UCSD’s .316.
Ehrman also came out strong, fin-
ishing with 19 kills on .289 hitting and a team-high 11 digs.
Sophomore middle back Calvin 
Ross and sophomore setter Phil Bannan had five blocks apiece. Bannan also notched 57 assists to go along with three kills.
Stanford opened the first set, taking 
a commanding 10-4 early lead. The Tritons came within three points of a tie on several occasions, but couldn’t close the margin after a 22-19 deficit. The Cardinal went on to score five of the next eight, taking the first set at 30-26.
The first minutes of the second set 
could best be described as a tug-of-war, with the score tying nine separate times. But the Tritons hit .594 as a team and eventually coasted to a 30-21 victory.
“We sided out at a really high per-
centage and were able to put a lot more serving pressure on them and get them out of their system, ” Ehrman said of UCSD’s second-set run.
After another back-and-forth  bat-
tle, Stanford eventually pulled away, capturing the third set by a score of 30-26.
In the decisive fourth set, Stanford 
didn’t mess around, opening for an 11-6 lead. UCSD fought back to come within 23-20 after a Fritsch kill, but the Cardinal would not budge, earning the overall victory with a score of 30-25.
On Friday night, the Tritons sought 
to make school history in their match against University of Pacific (3-23, 0-17 MPSF), and did just that after bringing out the brooms against the Tigers at RIMAC Arena. The win marked seven for the Tritons in league play and 11 overall in the season.
Junior opposite hitter Jason 
Spangler led the Tritons with 11 kills, while Ehrman added 10 kills of his own. As a team, the Tritons outhit the Tigers .434 to .136. UCSD also out-blocked Pacific 7-2.
The first set was tied at six before 
the Tritons went on a 15-6 rampage to take a 21-12 lead. UCSD cruised to a 30-19 win to set the tone of the match, hitting .458 while holding Pacific to a measly .036 hitting percentage.
The Tritons quickly jumped to a 
10-5 lead in the second set after back-to-back Ehrman kills and took a com-manding 23-14 lead after an eight-point service run led by Frank Fritsch. The Tritons sealed the set at 30-22.In a desperate attempt to force a 
fourth set, the Tigers took a 21-19 lead in the third, but relinquished the advantage after committing several errors. The Tritons took advantage of the miscues and — with their  sights set 
on the UCSD record books — swept Pacific by a final score of 30-24.
The Tritons are looking to carry 
momentum throughout their final home stand against conference rivals 
CSU Northridge, Cal State Long Beach and UC Santa Barbara.
“The top eight teams in our con-
ference make the MPSF playoffs and right now we’re in ninth place, one half game behind UCLA, ” Ehrman said. “We probably need to beat UCSB and Long Beach State to have a shot. ”

With its sweep over Pacific, UCSD set a new program record for wins in a season for the second consecutive 
year. The Tritons bested last season’s mark of 10 wins with four matches still left before playoffs.

ranks second in school history. 
Coming off the team’s impres-
sive performance at UCLA, Salerno 
emphasized the benefits of compet-ing in large invitationals.
“We really thrive on it, ” he said. 
“I think there was a time when it might have been intimidating, but I don’t think that’s the case now. We got some solid results from the team standpoint and came out ahead of some good, full-scholarship pro-grams. ” 
The Tritons return to UCLA on 
April 9 to compete in the three-day Rafer Johnson/Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational. The Tritons will then compete in two more meets on the road before returning home for the UCSD Triton Invitational on April 24 and 25. The home meet will be the team’s final competition before the CCAA Championships at the end of the month.

Chung 6-1, 6-1 at the No. 5 singles spot.
“Even though it was only my 
second match of the season, I wasn’t really nervous at all, ” Saket said. “Every day in practice, I’ve just learned so much from [senior cap-tains] Ina Dan and Tessa Tran, and I feel like I’ve grown immensely since the start of the season. ”
Sophomore Roxy Pourmirzaie, 
who competed in only two matches as a freshman, had the opportunity to play in front of the home fans at No. 3 singles. Pourmirzaie showed fine form in defeating Marine Prevost 6-3, 6-1. 
Senior Rina Nakano was pen-
ciled in for her first singles match of the year at No. 4 and didn’t disap-point, beating Joyce Librando 6-1, 6-3.
Looking ahead, the Tritons have 
two more regular-season matches remaining before the start of region-al play. 
First up is Point Loma Nazarene 
on April 15 in UCSD’s final home match of the season. The tilt will mark Senior Day for Dan, Tran and Nakano, all of whom have heav-ily contributed to UCSD’s confer-ence win streak during their time as Tritons. UCSD will finish its regular sea-
son on the road against Cal Poly Pomona on April 18  — a team the Tritons defeated 8-1 earlier this sea-son — hoping to finish its sixth consecutive season undefeated in conference play. 
The regular-season matches 
will culminate with the NCAA West Regional tournament, which begins on May 9. Should the Tritons advance, they will compete in the 
NCAA National Championships from May 13 to May 16, taking place in Altamonte Springs, Fla.

Contributing Writer
TRACK & FIELD — Competing 
between two of the highest profile events of its season, the UCSD track and field team took a brief trip to North San Diego County last week-end to compete in the inaugural Mangrum Invitational at Cal State San Marcos. The low-key meet was non-scoring, which gave the Tritons a chance to prepare for larger events ahead, including the Rafer Johnson/Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational at UCLA on April 9. 
“Whenever we’re in uniform, 
we’re going to compete, ” men’s coach Tony Salerno said. “But when there are points on the line, we are inclined to cover every event and move people around. This was a nice event to set us up for events coming up in the next few weeks. ”
Without the pressure to per-
form at their best, many of the athletes competed in fewer events or ran distances different than nor-mal. Nevertheless, junior Casey Ryan once again surpassed his own school record in the high jump and reached the mark of seven feet, an exceptional  feat for a jumper at 
any level. Senior Sarah Hendy also stood out in the field events, tying  
her personal best of 158’4” in the discus throw. 
UCSD’s success against local opponents comes on the heels of a strong showing last week at the Cal/Nevada  Collegiate Championships 
at UCLA. The men finished 12th and the women’s team placed fifth against a field that included several formidable Division-I programs. 
The Tritons were led by sev-
eral outstanding performances that ranked among the best in program history. 
On the men’s side, senior Scott 
Tsuda took second place in the tri-ple jump, topping his own person-al best and setting another school record with a mark of 48’ 10.75” .

WOMEN’S TENNIS — As No. 10 
UCSD readies to conclude its regular season, the Tritons appear primed to keep their remarkable streak in California Collegiate Athletic Association play intact. UCSD 
extended its unprecedented run in 
conference to 58 straight wins when 
it defeated Cal State Los Angeles 9-0 at home on April 4. Despite the dominating score, head coach Liz LaPlante was still able to find play-ing time for her reserves, showcasing the tremendous depth of talent she has at her disposal. 
“With our season quickly com-
ing to a close, I really wanted to let 
some other girls get an opportunity 
to play, ” LaPlante said. “I have such a wealth of talent to choose from when I’m making the ladder, and it really showed with the results we had against Cal State L.A. The Golden Eagles aren’t one of the stronger teams in our league, but it was still impressive to see the way our team continued to compete. It’s very rewarding to see our team translate all the hard work we put in practice onto the court, especially against conference opponents. ”
All six singles matches were 
decided in straight sets, and after solid performance by the three doubles teams, the match with the Golden Eagles was over after just two hours. Sophomores Natalie Varnay and Taskeen Bains catalyzed the impressive performance with their tremendous play at the top 
two singles spots, just as they have all season. At No. 1 singles, Varnay 
surrendered only three games to her opponent Lana Lamesic, win-
ning 6-3, 6-0, while Bains dispatched 
Adriana Espinosa 6-1, 6-4. Bains and Varnay teamed up at the No. 1 dou-bles position to grab an 8-1 victory over Espinosa and Jennifer Chung.
LaPlante used the last four sin-
gles spots to exhibit her team’s array of depth and get some action in for rookies like freshmen Samantha Y eung and Lauren Saket. While both 
are expected to be important con-
tributors in the years to come, they both had a chance to showcase what the team’s future holds. Saket earned the most convincing win of the day, a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Crystal Lam at No. 6 singles. Y eung was just as Though we had to wait a few days longer than usual, the most glorious day of spring 
— Opening Day — is finally upon us. Watching last night’s game between Atlanta and Philadelphia, which offi-cially kicked off the 2009 season, even Joe Morgan’s ever-clueless com-mentary (R.I.P . Firejoemorgan.com; our dream will come true someday) couldn’t ruin my mood. With today marking the season’s beginning for 26 ballclubs, here’s what California’s five teams will encounter this season and some thoughts on Opening Day. 
Dodgers at Padres
Eighty-four wins were enough for 
the Dodgers to take the NL West title 
last season and they’ll probably be enough for a repeat. An enviable blend of proven veterans and young talent, the Dodgers’ lineup is most definitely good enough to battle with Arizona for the division crown. Undoubtedly, the starting rotation and bullpen are Los Angeles’ weak links starting the year. Fortunately for the Dodger hurl-ers, they should get a confidence boost playing San Diego to open the season.
The Padres have almost no shot at 
making the playoffs and will probably be looking to sell their few working parts to other teams later this season. With a complete lack of offensive pop — no, we’re not yelling “Kouz” at you anymore, we’re just booing — the line-up is in need of a complete overhaul. Not even “the little David Eckstein that could” has enough heart and grit to save this team from a dismal showing.
Athletics at Angels
While the A ’s have made no head-
way on building a new stadium — 
make it happen, San Jose — G.M. Billy Beane is essentially finished rebuilding his team. The only thing left to do for the A ’s is exactly what they did at the beginning of Beane’s reign — let a young rotation pitch its way to the top. With Justin Duchscherer on the disabled list, Braden takes over the mound and officially begins the new 1HUHUP:YPKOHYHU

In the Cal/Nevada Collegiate Championships at UCLA, the Triton men placed 12th out of 22 teams while 
the women’s team finished fifth out of 24 teams. The host Bruins took first place in both divisions.

Facing a weaker team in a conference that UCSD has dominated for over five years, the Tritons called on their bench to compete in singles play and pulled off a 9-0 shutout over the Golden Eagles.
