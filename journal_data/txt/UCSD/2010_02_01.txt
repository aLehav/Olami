Allegations of student exploi-
tation have caused the Graduate 
Student Association to begin drafting a bill of rights to protect the graduate community. 
According to GSA President Alex 
James, a bill- of-rights committee was created to draft a document modeled after similar bills created by other UC graduate organizations. 
The idea was first proposed last 
year after GSA  leaders were noti-fied that certain students had suf-fered from unfair labor practices. According to GSA VP of Internal 
Affairs John Alaniz, professors can 
exploit foreign students by capital-izing on their pressure to perform. 
“If an international student was 
fired, he would have to leave the country, go through immigration and find a new job, ” he said. “In com-parison, if a state student was fired, he would not have the same sense of urgency and the same consequences to face. ”
Although Alaniz declined to pro-
vide specific examples, he said GSA has received reports of university individuals who take advantage of this situation, making these already disadvantaged students work harder than state students. 
One of the most important pro-
visions of the bill is the “right to arbitration, ” under which a set of guidelines allow for dispute and resolve between a student and supe-rior. The “right to arbitration” provi-sion would ensure students know they have a right to dispute unfair practices, he said. 
“We want students to know that if 
there’s a dispute, they have the right to address it without worry, ” Alaniz said. “We just want them to know they can approach the department and can bring their disagreements to light. ”
The current draft also asks that 
the university create more holidays 
for graduate students. Although 
graduate students teach, they are not

Looksinto Law School

After decades happily buried in 
graduate engineering and microbi-
ology, UCSD finally has something besides science on the brain.
UCSD and the San Diego-based 
California Western School of Law have formed a joint committee to discuss the creation of a UCSD law school. 
Instead of having to build a new 
campus, the program would use the present Cal Western facilities under the UCSD name.
The two institutes currently 
offer a joint master’s program in health law, under which credits can be earned toward a UCSD degree. 
According to Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Paul Drake, the proposal to merge the two schools is tentative, so no concrete timeline has been established. 
However, Drake said the 
school’s history of collaboration makes the newest proposal more feasible. 
“What’s great about this plan 
is we’re not starting from scratch, ” Drake said. 
Similar proposals for a merg-
er date as far back as the 1980s, but have always fallen through because the law school was deemed an unnecessary cost by the state. According to Steven Smith, dean of Cal Western, the new collaboration is likely to be successful because it will rely on the existing resources of both universities instead of pub-lic funding. 
“The old proposal involved a 
great deal of public funding, and that was a problem, ” Smith said. “With the current financial strength 
of CWSL, the proposed combination 
is self-funding. ”Thirty years after the 
first try, UCSD proposes a merge with California Western School of Law.

Say ‘goodbye’ to that 15-minute reprieve 
from lecture at the end of every quarter: As 
of this winter, students won’t be 
assessing their professors during classtime anymore.
Instead, Course and Professor 
Evaluations — a student orga-nization that administers course 
evaluations — will move the entire evaluations process online.  
C.A.P .E. was founded 38 years ago, when a 
large  part of its service was publishing results in an annual hardcopy book. Now, the organization will offer online evaluations during the ninth and 10th week of classes, and post the results after final grades are due.
C.A.P .E. director Alan Lam said the transi-
tion is caused by budget cuts: The service does not have the money to pay 50 student runners to distribute the evaluations to classrooms. 
Associate Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Education Barbara Sawrey, who regulates the program, said that moving the evaluations online may save up to $50,000 in annual salary and paper costs.

With the national unemployment rate at a staggering 16-year 
high of 7.2 percent, job seekers  across the nation  are looking 
for anything to give themselves a competitive edge — even if it means going back to school. 
That’s why UCSD  Extension, the professional education and public-ser-

According to Lam, moving the ser-
vice online will help simplify the evalu-
ation process and save 250,000 pieces of paper. 
“With the online C.A.P .E.s, we will 
have a less error-prone rate of dis-tributing and collecting the results, ” Lam said. 
All classes will continue to receive 
C.A.P .E. evaluations. Each student will receive an e-mail from C.A.P .E. with a link to a personalized “class list” Web site, where they will find evalua-tion forms for each class. Students can revise their evaluations until midnight before the first day of finals. 
The questions on the form will 
remain identical to ones administered in previous years, and will continue to be anonymous. 
C.A.P .E. launched an online pilot 
to test the program during Summer Session 2009. Initial results were posi-tive: 98 percent of classes contributed responses, compared to 75 percent in the 2008 Summer Session, which used the paper evaluations. 
However, since Summer Session 
class sizes are much smaller than those in fall, winter and spring, Lam said he expects the online program to be slow at first.
“Initially, the response rate is going 
to be low, ” Lam said. “Our main goal right now is to boost student aware-ness. ”
Warren sophomore Katie Chen, 
who said she uses C.A.P .E. results to help choose her class schedule, expressed doubts about whether stu-dents would use the program in its online form.
“I’ll still take the time to fill it out, 
but I have a feeling that a lot of other students won’t, ” Chen said. 
C.A.P .E. directors are planning 
to team up with the A.S. Council to promote “C.A.P .E. Week” later in the quarter. Together, they will send e-mail reminders to students about the change, and set up an information table on campus about the new setup.
According to Lam, C.A.P .E. has 
revamped its Web site. In addition, the organization plans on sending out e-mail reminders to students who haven’t completed all their evaluations. 
Students who do complete the 
online forms will be entered into a raffle for Triton Cash cards.
C.A.P .E. Assistant Director Ben 
Lewin said he is not worried about lower student turnout biasing the evaluations. In contrast, he said the online system should result in a wider variety of students participating in the program. 
“Students who choose not to go to 
class regularly may fill out the evalua-tions, and have more representation in the results, ” Lewin said. 
Sawrey said the new system will 
benefit professors as well. 
“Staff will benefit with a full assur-
ance that all students will have an opportunity to provide feedback, ” Sawrey said. “Faculty will not lose any class time, since students will fill out the surveys outside of class. ”
Lam said the evaluations come 
in handy for professors as well, who ask for their forms as exit evaluations when they move on to new positions. 
He said he believes the new system 
will make for a fairer course-evaluation process. 
According to Sawrey, the idea to 
move C.A.P .E. online was proposed for the last several years by C.A.P .E. direc-
tors. She said the new system will allow students more time to complete evalu-ations, which in turn benefits staff. 
Sawrey said she that the new online 
system will open up the possibility of specialized C.A.P .E. evaluations for TAs, labs and seminars in the future.

Smith said the law school has 
enough money — from tuition, income and grants — to cover opera-tional costs.  
The UC Irvine School of Law, 
which opened Fall Quarter 2009, offered free tuition to its inaugural class, and halved tuition for the fol-lowing year’s class, in hopes of attract-ing top students.
However, UCSD’s new law school 
would not be able to grant a similar amount of free tuition. 
Smith said that San Diego is one 
of the few large cities without a law school, and the necessity for one has become increasingly important in the years since a partnership with Cal Western was first proposed. 
“The legal profession has become 
increasingly interdisciplinary, and needs connections to other academic programs, ” Smith said. “Both UC San Diego and California Western have become much more sophisticated and more mature institutions in the last 30 years, and both have improved. ”
He added that the proposal is 
likely to succeed this time because the UC Board of Regents has become more open-minded in its approach to law schools. In addition to estab-lishing the law school at UC Irvine last year, the regents have indicated that UC Riverside should consider a law school as well.
The details of the 
merger are presently undecided, but com-mittee discussions have ranged from the affiliation of certain minor programs to complete acquisition of Cal Western by UCSD. 
One area of con-
cern is the differing academic priori-ties between the two schools. While UCSD is a top research uni-versity, Cal Western places limited emphasis in the area. 
“Cal Western will have to adapt to 
UCSD standards in research, ” Drake said. 
He said that it is difficult for a 
new law school to break rankings, especially because the top-ranked law schools have held their positions for 
decades. Both Smith and Drake said they hope to move into the top 30 or 
40 national rankings eventually. 
Warren College junior Emma 
Chan, who has visited the Cal Western campus, said she sees a disconnect between the two campuses. 
“Cal Western has a differ-
ent vibe, ” Chan said. “I feel like UCSD will just go in and restructure it. ”
However, Warren College 
junior Josh Grossman said the idea is financially practical.
“The new law school seems 
like a good idea, especially for visibility, as it would increase UCSD’s prestige, ” Grossman said. “I would go to a UCSD law school because it would be cheaper than private law schools. ”
The proposal for a merger 
will be officially drawn up in May or June of this year . It must be approved by Cal Western, UCSD, the UC Office of the President and the UC Board of Regents, which would probably hap-pen by early 2011.

receive any vacation days other than national holidays. For example, they do not receive days off during Spring Break. 
Alaniz said that all these provi-
sions are meant to reduce the strain on graduate students.
“Graduate students are under a lot 
of stress, and are some of the greatest consumers of student mental-health services on campus, ” he said. “We want to protect these students who are working and teaching, juggling a lot of responsibility and in a tenuous position. ”
The bill is currently being dis-
cussed within the GSA and Grad Life, a committee of faculty and graduate students. 
After the bill is finalized, it must 
be approved by GSA, the faculty sen-ate and Chancellor Marye Anne Fox before it is passed.
Although the bill has not been 
officially brought to the chancellor’s office, it was discussed at the town hall meeting last Wednesday, where Fox voiced preliminary support for the initiative. 
“We haven’t looked at it care-
fully, but we’ d be happy to do what we can, ” she said. “I think it’s a great idea. ”
Alaniz said the GSA committee 
hopes to have the bill passed by the end of this year. 
“We hope this is something we do 
once, and then will help the rest of the graduate student population for a long time, ” Alaniz said.

ON CAMPUS —  Before making any commitments 
on WebReg, students try to find out which profes-
sors give easy ‘ A ’s, whose lectures are worth listening to and what sort of workload to expect. But now 
that UCSD’s most reliable evaluation service has moved its surveys online, students may soon be picking their classes in the dark.
This quarter, due to funding cuts from UCSD’s 
Course and Professor Evaluation program,  students 
will assess their professors in an online survey instead of in the lecture hall. 
The new C.A.P .E. system might save some paper, but a more casual online presence might make its existence — and the efforts of all those involved — entirely pointless. 
In the past, every student who happened to 
show up to lecture the day C.A.P .E. evaluations were administered would voluntarily take a few moments to tell the program what they thought of the class. It was a way to ensure that every type of student — from sleepy slacker to eager-eyed overachiever — had a voice in the system. 
The online version guarantees a slant in the 
turnout. While we all find plenty of time stalk perfect strangers and watch videos of angry babies online, we often don’t fill out the gobs of monoto-nous surveys that flood our ACS accounts. Taking the time to fill out online C.A.P .E. evaluations won’t be any different. It’s a lot easier to ignore an e-mail — or simply click “delete” — than brush off the fel-low student handing you a C.A.P .E. form (and giv-ing you the evil eye until you fill it out). 
Even C.A.P .E. Director Alan Lam said that par-
ticipation will plummet.

The dry, monotonous spiel about why our country is so great — to the chorus of 
laugh-track applause — could only be expected from the State of the Union address. However, after about five minutes of red, white and blue blabber, something strange happened: I experienced that same year-old warm, fuzzy feeling of Obama-engendered hope. For just a moment, it seemed our country might improve its economy, helping the everyman secure a breadwinning job.
Even if Obama’s speech was just another bril-
liantly brainwashing script, the visuals — Wall Street shelling out dollar bills to the little guys, the U.S. doubling its exports to increase produc-tivity and employment, not going broke just to go to college — were delivered perfectly. From pausing to flash his pearly whites to raising his voice in mock-Evangelist call-and-response, Obama proved that — even if he can’t bring about immediate, palpable change — he can still 
deliver one hell of a one-man show. And that, 
given our broken economy and divided popula-tion, might be motivation enough for the rest of us to make it happen. (Not to mention it made for quality television.)
We can all roll our eyes at the optimistic 
tone reverberating through the White House. But at the end of the day, the belief that our nation can make a necessary shift for the better is all we have to hang onto. 
Obama was able to inspire, and sometimes 
a little pep-talk is all we need to take the next step.
— Kelsey Marrujo  
Senior Staff WriterWith an approval rating now hovering at 48 percent, President Barack Obama 
entered last Wednesday night’s State of the Union address with a weighty task at hand: to convince us that, under his guidance, the coun-try is back on the right track. 
Obama did well to call on the other branch-
es of the government to do their part; even his own party, he noted, has the largest congres-sional majority it’s seen in decades, but would rather “run for the hills” than work toward that elusive change.
One man can’t singlehandedly alter our 
national course without the help of a willing congress — which too many of the president’s critics fail to remember. 
Though the focus of his speech was largely 
on the importance of creating new jobs — an 
issue that affects all of us — Obama was wise to 
target more specific groups, such as college stu-dents and the gay community, to boost morale.
He declared that 2010 will be the year we 
witness the end of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, and that all who want a col-
lege education will be able to afford one, given the extension of the national government’s Pell Grant program. 
In fact, Obama did such a good job of cov-
ering all his niche bases — military families, gays and broke students, too — that a reported 83 percent of viewers, according to a CBS News poll, responded positively to the speech. 
So whether or not there’s change, at least we 
all seem to believe in it.
— Trevor Cox
Opinion Editor  In Wednesday’s State of the Union address, President Obama said the top domestic priority 
for 2010 will be creating  jobs. And indeed, unem-
ployment is a very immediate concern. 
But it also reminds us how desperately he needs 
support from the middle class.
The House already passed a $174-billion bill to 
create new jobs last December. The bill’s fate is now up to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) said it will be the first major legislation taken up after the health-care reform bill is com-pleted.
Now, the address’ main proposals — building 
clean energy facilities, giving rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy-efficient and providing tax breaks to companies that create jobs in the U.S. — look promising to those who didn’t benefit from last year’s economic stimulus package.
Faced with voter anxiety over high unemploy-
ment, Obama’s fellow Democrats are at risk of losing big in November’s congressional elections. Amid 
eroding support from middle-class Americans, 
Obama is worried he’ll lose party majorities in the House and the Senate.
That’ s probably why he felt he needed to men-
tion the word “jobs” 29 times in his speech to Congress. 
This was Obama’s attempt to show the middle 
class that he understands their financial predica-ment. Restoring his popularity with the middle class is the only way for the Democrats to secure con-
trol of the House and Senate. Whether or not the 
employment bill actually ends up on top of his desk pile, Obama intends to come out a hero.

;\I\MWN\PM=VQWV)LLZM[[QUICKTAKESOh, Winter Quarter —  notori-ously dull, sexless and devoid of the carefree hookups 
famous to sunny San Diego. If you have your eye on a willing acquain-tance, co-worker or TA, but don’t know quite how to take the plunge, wonder no more. Beat your winter dry spell with an after-hours hot-tub hookup  — one of the most tried and 
true settings for seduction. 
First off, you don’t actually need 
your own hot tub to get down in one. Most La Jolla complexes (many with low, hoppable gates) are equipped with a hot, bubbly body of water, and any Jacuzzi within walking distance is fair game. 
Second, you’ll need suitable attire. 
If the hot-tub  session is spontaneous, 
chances are slim that your hookup-to-be will be toting swim trunks or a cute bikini, so improvise. Strip down to your unmentionables. Guys: no T-shirts. Girls: nothing baggy. Y ou both know where the night is going, so the sooner you loosen cumbersome clothing, the better. 
Y ou and your next conquest must 
be alone for your plan to succeed. A group setting will lead to the inevita-ble game of 10 fingers, eliminating all chances of getting anywhere — unless all involved are down for grouplovin’ . Junior-high games will also takes the focus off you two, posing the possibil-ity that you or your unwitting friends might reveal one too many hot-tub hookups past. Plus, there’s nothing worse than the awkward moment when the rest of the group exits the tub while you and your hookup-to-be linger, making your horny intentions uncomfortably clear.
The final item on your must-do 
list is obvious: Buy wine. Lots of it. If this is your first time hooking up in a public place, heavy intoxication is necessary. A bottle of two-buck Chuck will do fine — after all, class in a hot tub is certainly not key. 
Now that you’re drunk and half-
naked, floating in a pool of swirling, slightly nauseating foam, it’s time to get intimate. Ask those burn-ing questions you’ d never whip out in review session. Challenge your tub buddy to an innocent wrestling match. With most of your clothes and inhibitions gone, it’s time to move in for the kill.
How far you are willing to go in 
the hot tub is a matter of personal comfort. Feelings of shame or para-noia might bubble, but in most cases, it’s best to ignore them. Every rus-tling pinecone or squeaky fence will have you convinced that an elderly grandmother or group of preschool-ers is about to walk in on your kinky escapade. These are the most glorious 
moments of your undergraduate exis-
tence — not a time for modesty. 
At the very worst, a pervy security 
guard might force you to sheepishly climb out of the hot tub, collect your discarded clothes and stumble off back to your room (or the shuttle stop) — but don’t let Mr. Officer put a damper on your night. How-to Guru knows firsthand that in winter, there’s 
no greater priority than finding cre-
ative ways to stay warm.

OPINION MONDAY , FEBRUARY 1, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 
In order for C.A.P .E. results to be 
accurate, they should reflect a slice 
of students that attended the class. When the questionnaire goes digital, it runs the risk that every voluntary survey poses: Only those with strong opinions — whether it’s the puppy-dog brown-noser or the asshole who wants revenge for his ‘F’ — will par-ticipate. 
With the change of venue, 
C.A.P .E. won’t have much advan-tage over RateMyProfessors.com, where opinions are typically con-centrated at extreme ends of the spectrum. The students who write on RateMyProfessors.com either have a 
huge vendetta to fulfill or couldn’t get enough of the Dimensions of Culture series; what’s made C.A.P .E. so valu-able in the past, however, is that it sampled everyone — including those who fall in the middle who might, for instance, help determine how many hours of work the course requires. 
Though the age-old raffle strategy 
works for some orgs, C.A.P .E. ’s one-in-60 chance at a $10 Triton Cash gift certificate probably won’t convince anyone to take a 10-minute survey.
One way to eliminate the appar-
ently costly runners would be to pair the C.A.P .E. program with individual departments. The chemistry depart-ment, among others, already has its own separate evaluation that profes-sors distribute. It wouldn’t be a big stretch to simply require that profes-sors hand out C.A.P .E. evaluations and return them to the department. 
After all, CAPE isn’t just for stu-
dents; professors, too, often use their evaluations as letters of recommenda-tion as they move to other universi-ties. The forms are already anony-mous, anyway, so there’s no need to worry a professor would see.
Even though C.A.P .E. is planning 
on partnering with the A.S. Council to spread student awareness for the new online system, there is no amount of fliers or booths on Library Walk that will be able to ensure the high participation rate the program currently boasts. While C.A.P .E. may be taking a step in eco-friendliness by going digital, it’s taking two costly steps back in thoroughness and accu-racy.

▶ C.A.P.E., MYVTWHNLDear Editor,
As reported in the Jan. 28 article 
“Council Excuses Senator Absences, Re-examines Loft, ” A.S. Advocate General Parminder Sandhu proposed a resolution of impeachment for three senators. 
Unfortunately, councilmembers 
thought it made for good politics to not vote to impeach the aforemen-tioned senators. I understand that councilmembers do not want to antagonize their colleagues, but not impeaching those who have hor-rendous attendance records sends the clear message that one will never be held accountable for one’s actions and duties in council. The same council that was worried about donating money to Haiti is clearly setting a dan-gerous precedent for unaccountability among its own members. 
I understand that councilmembers 
have to juggle numerous responsi-bilities in addition to serving their constituents. However, if a senator or associate vice president is continually absent  and not held accountable for 
doing his job, then how else are his constituents’ interests adequately rep-resented? How will students take the A.S. Council and its work seriously when the members of the said council do not take their jobs seriously? 
Accruing more than three absenc-
es not only makes a councilmember look incompetent and irresponsible, but it clearly conveys the fact that the said councilmember does not care about his job and constituents. It boggles my mind that some coun-cilmembers have already racked up 7.5 absences and are now pathetically begging and kowtowing to not be impeached for their ineptitude. 
If the A.S. Council wishes to be 
more efficient in its representation of students’ interests, then swift pun-ishment must be meted out to the incompetent few. Otherwise, they will continue to miss council meetings and concoct weak excuses as to why they were absent. Rewarding those unfit to serve students’ interests makes for bad governance. If the A.S. Council were a business, most of its employees would have been fired already for their poor attendance records. Councilmembers must view the work they do as another important job — not some additional extracurricular activity to be added on their resume.

INTERNATIONAL HOUSE6  THE UCSD GUARDIAN
Founded in 1966, UCSD Extension offers classes that focus on 
developing technical skills, aimed at fast-track students and devel-
oping adult professionals in San Diego. With 14 different areas of study — including digital arts, business, law, education and health care — Extension offers a more practical variety, compared to the “let there be light” academic focus of university curriculum.
By constantly updating its course offerings to keep up with 
trends in the job market — particularly in high-tech fields like in-formation technology and software engineering — Extension has seen record-breaking enrollment over the last two years. Within the 2008-09 academic year, enrollment increased 10 percent, jumping to 54,000 enrollees and 23,248 students in 4,663 courses.
“In 2009, despite the weak economy, adult education was one 
of the two industries that actually went up, ” Extension Assistant Dean for External Affairs Henry DeVries said. “People want to bridge to new careers or new areas of employment that are in higher demand. ”
In over 120 certificate programs, DeVries said students are able 
to explore specialized careers that UCSD curriculum often doesn’t cover, like copyediting, clinical trials and accounting. Upon com-pleting a minimum of 20 units within one to two years, Extension students receive a certificate to verify their completion.
“[Students] apply for certificate programs to gain extra skills, ” 
DeVries said. “For instance, you might have a background in busi-ness or manufacturing, but not in biotechnology manufacturing. So, you might come to us to study for that, and then bridge to a career in that field. ”
A growing number of partnerships between Extension and 
professional industries have made the school’s certificates widely 
respected within the San Diego business community, according to DeVries. Many companies actually send their employees to Exten-

FROM POLI. PROF. TO PROVOSTfolk
Last September, a new provost was appointed to 
Eleanor Roosevelt College. His name is Alan Houston, and he’s a political-science professor, 
award-winning scholar, father of two and die-hard fan of Stephen Colbert (sorry, Stewart-philes).
“I totally adore the Colbert Report, ” Houston said. 
“Oh, yeah. He’s a genius. ”
For the last two decades Houston has worked at all 
levels in the political-science department — from teach-ing freshmen to advising graduate student dissertations. Before he came to UCSD, he taught at both Columbia University and Harvard University.
To top off his Ivy prestige, Houston snagged a few 
awards in the meantime.
His Harvard dissertation on revolutionary political 
writer Algernon Sidney was awarded the Leo Strauss Award in political philosophy from the American Politi-cal Science Association in 1990. 
According to the new provost, one of his favorite 
jobs has been teaching undergraduates. 
“I’ve been teaching a freshman seminar at ERC that 
I taught in the fall, and am now continuing to teach, ” Houston said. “ And that’s one of the most electric and lively parts of my week. I totally enjoy that. ”
Now that he’s stepped over to administration, Hous-
ton said his schedule has become much more hectic.
“ A fair portion of my day is spent either meeting 
with individuals or with groups who are running the college… It’s meetings, me etings, meetin gs, meetings. 
There are faculty to meet with, and students to talk to, and I still have both undergraduate and graduate students I’m working with on projects — so it’s a busy full day. ”
Despite the added workload, Houston said he 
already feels like part of the ERC community.
 “This is exactly where I want to be, doing what I 
want to do, ” Houston said. “This is a very hard time for the UC system and for the colleges, but I’m happy to be here and to be a part of figuring out how to get through those problems. ”
Houston said his top concern is dealing with the 
budget cuts, which — as students confront fee hikes and faculty are dealt furloughs — will make next year one of the most difficult in university history. 
“I know that maintaining the quality and integrity of 
undergraduate education is the most important thing I can do for students, ” Houston said. “ As the costs grow for students, we need to work very hard to ensure that the quality of their education — as well as services and resources offered — remain strong. ”
In addition, by the end of his term as provost, Hous-
ton said he hopes to meet the oft-neglected needs of ERC transfer students. According to Houston, the founding model for UCSD was originally designed for freshmen, but the transfer-student population is increasing. 
“Transfer students are an important part of our stu-
dent body, and their needs and concerns are sometimes different from those of the four-year students, ” Houston said. “I want to pay attention to that, and help our college create a fully integrated model for them. ”
Another of his 
goals is establishing more intimate ties with the student body. Having attended a small liberal-arts college as an under-graduate, Houston said he thrived on the personal interaction he experienced with his professors; in fact, it inspired him to pursue a career teach-ing political science. Although such one-
on-one interaction is rarer at a large public university like UCSD, Houston said the university’s unique college system lets students feel more at home.
Within ERC, Houston said he’s committed to the 
college’s mission: enable students to live as globally minded as possible. 
 “I think it actually soaks in, and I think people really 
come to identity with MMW , ” said Houston. “They end up thinking, ‘Hey, that was the coolest class. ’” 
He said he wants to prepare students to succeed in 
a multicultural world that is not “defined narrowly by nations, states or single cultures. ”
“The basic mission of ERC is clear, and doesn’t need 
to be tinkered with, ” Houston said. “But allowing it to grow and thrive in this changing budget is going to be the biggest challenge. ”

UCSD’s Fashion Quarterly 
claims to be the first fashion magazine on any UC cam-
pus  —although Cal’s BARE might protest. 
The student publication began 
in 2007 under the masthead Secret Scholar, but changed its name last year to more literal Fashion Quarterly (literal except for the fact that it’s released only twice a year); however, its motto has stayed the same: “Smart is sexy. ”
“We didn’t want to follow the 
stereotypical ‘hot, sexy’ on the cover, ” Fashion Quarterly co-editor Lois Lim said. “We wanted it to be known that you don’t have to be just smart or just sexy — you can have both. ”
All of Fashion Quarterly’s cover 
girls are UCSD students, who un-dergo a competitive casting process to get the gig — including an application asking for their GPA, major, extracurricular activities and hobbies, followed by in-person interviews. Once the cover girl is chosen, she’s given the VIP treat-ment; dolled up by professional makeup artists and hair stylists, then given a scenic San Diego photo shoot.“It’s really important that our 
cover models embody what smart and sexy is, ” Lim said. “Y ou want them to be a role model to everyone else. And they’ve never been able to be on the cover and do a photo shoot, so it helps their confidence as well. ”
Every issue of Fashion Quarterly 
features the handiwork of two local fashion designers, including at least one student. Since its inception, the publication has formed ties with local stores, makeup artists, hair stylists and photographers — who all lend support during the produc-tion process.
A grand total of 32 writers, 
designers, bloggers and publicists release approximately 25 Elle-aspiring pages twice a year — on top of the requisite launch parties and quarterly events such as fashion shows, fundraisers and makeovers. 
“Fashion is so relatable, ” Fashion 
Quarterly co-editor Liz Kim said. “Fashion is everywhere and touches so many people. I don’t think people realize how important it is. And there’s more to fashion than clothes. ”

“Of the Extension students we 
have, about half of them are sent by 
their company, ” DeVries said. “If you think of all the major companies — Qualcomm, Sony, Sempra Energy, PG&E — all of those companies are sending their employees to us. ”
After finding out about Exten-
sion classes through a co-worker, 2009 Warren College graduate April Harter took seven Extension classes, four of which were completed for her certificate in sustainable business practices. She took advantage of a program for full-time UCSD students called LAUNCH, in which juniors and senior take Extension classes concur-rently with their academic classes and meet with a career mentor quarterly to discuss their aspirations
“[Extension courses] were different 
than undergraduate classes because they were applied, ” Harter said. “Y ou could really do hands-on projects. We looked at case studies, worked in groups. We often had one or two large presentations to give in front of the class. So we really had to look at issues that we were discussing. And all of my courses — some were more in media, some in sustainability — headed back to the business curriculum. ”
Small class sizes also allowed Har-
ter and Warren College Senior Dara Bu an opportunity to network with professors and business-professionals.
“[Extension professors] are 
actively working in the field, ” Harter said. “They’re very connected in the community; they’re involved in other organizations. So they’re very knowledgeable about events happing in the community. Different Exten-sion professors might suggest us to go to these events — whether it [would be] in a chamber or a professional organization. It brings us places that aren’t strictly academic, but more professional. ”
Bu agreed, adding that the intimate 
environment made the experience of getting to know her professors less stressful than with university profes-sors.
“I felt a lot less pressure in this 
course, ” Bu said. “My professor even hooked me up with an opportunity to write for [San Diego News Network] and attend the [Public Relations Society of America] conference. I’ve already asked him for a letter of rec-ommendation. ”
Both Harter and Bu said they feel 
their time at Extension has given them a competitive edge in the workforce by adding extra skills to their resume. Harter, who now works as a director of social media for Scribe Commu-nications, said earning her Extension certificate helped prepare her for the office environment.
“Having the certificate has defi-
nitely helped me understand some of the choices and practices that our clients are making, ” Harter said. 
However, a recent uprising of 
unhappy web-design students cast a shadow on Extension’s reputation.
Last summer, Extension Digital 
Art Center graduate Kevin Root en-rolled in a web-design class that would arouse controversy over Extension’s refund policy and its self-proclaimed commitment to serving the “critical lifelong knowledge and skill develop-ment needs of individuals, organiza-tions and the community. ”
Last summer, 20 students signed a 
letter of complaint while 12 students, Root included, filed a formal grievance with the administration demanding a refund of a $6,750 enrollment fee. The students said they were demanding their money back because they felt the class had not adequately prepared them for a career in web design, as promised. 
The subjects of contention were 
instructors Harrison Watts who had left town for 20 days and attempted to teach the class via email and John Lane who allegedly relied on unclear, unconnected teaching methods.
In response, Extension gave the 
students three choices: accept nine prepaid units of Extension courses, three months of online training worth $75 or six Saturdays of class-time learning Flash design. 
“We listened to the students’ 
concerns about their lack of training and offered them opportunities for further education, ” DeVries said in a Dec. 3 article in the Guardian . “The 
reparations the students were offered were very fair and reasonable. ”
At that time, only seven of the 12 
students had accepted the university’s offer.
Root and a few others, however, 
said they refused the three options because they did not provide the same depth and amount of instruction for which they had originally paid. Cur-rently, Root is looking into pursuing legal action.
“It’s pretty disappointing, ” Root 
said. “I’m no closer to becoming a web designer than when I started Exten-sion. I don’t really want to get burned again [by another program like Exten-sion], so I’ll probably teach myself and hope I can figure it out along the way. ”
Although Root found the Digital 
Art Center program disappointing, he said doesn’t necessarily have a nega-tive opinion of the entire Extension program.
“I’m sure there are parts of Exten-
sion that are phenomenal, but I only know what I see, ” Root said. “I prob-ably would tell people [interested in Extension] to do a lot of research. ”
Though Root and his peers were 
heavily dissatisfied with their instruc-tion, he said getting to know his fellow classmates was the most rewarding aspect of his time at Extension.
“One shining part was that there 
were a lot of good people, ” Root said. “Everyone in the class was really close, so we are really helpful with each other. My friend and I actually started our own little design firm. ”
Because Harter and Bu were both 
UCSD undergraduate students when taking Extension courses, the division gave them a voucher for complimen-tary enrollment. Worth $270, the voucher covers most, if not all, of the costs for one course. These vouchers are available at the Extension office every quarter to full-time UCSD students.
“LAUNCH is really a lot of bang 
for your buck, ” Harter said. “The certificate programs are really reason-able as well. It’s a lot cheaper than if a working adult wanted to do a certificate in the program. Some of my courses were worth $450, but I took four classes for $650. ”

career high — the second double-double of his career.
Less than a minute into the second 
half, the Tritons trailed the Coyotes 42-31, but — thanks to a huge offen-sive rebound by Hatch — they rallied to pull within a point to 67-68.
However, Hatch’s points were 
the Tritons’ last, and the Coyotes went on to secure the 76-67 win.
The Coyotes shot just 
under 45 percent in the game — hitting 26 of 58 from the field — while the Tritons sank 21 of 47. UCSD won the rebound battle 34-25, but yielded 18 Coyote points off turn-overs. 
“We gave a tremendous 
effort out there tonight, ” head coach Chris Carlos said in an interview with the athletic department. “I thought the crowd was outstanding and full of energy, and we played real-ly hard in the second half. We didn’t get the result we were after obviously, but the effort was there. ”
On Thursday, freshman guard 
Jake Tarabilda scored a season-high 15 points to lead a tepid Triton offense against Cal Poly Pomona. The Broncos limited UCSD to shooting 33 percent.
Tarabilda and senior guard Tyler 
Acevedo hit two three-pointers apiece to help the Tritons build an early lead. Trailing 15-13 with nine minutes in the half, the Tritons answered with a 12-2 run over the next seven minutes, taking a 25-17 lead. Christian Hatch converted three free throws during the stretch, and Acevedo hit back-to-back triples to pad the lead. 
Despite the Tritons’ late tear in the 
first half, Cal Poly Pomona imposed their game in the second half: The Broncos opened with a 22-9 run to take a 42-34 lead with six minutes remaining. The Tritons threatened a comeback by cutting to within six points, but the Broncos scored the next six to take their biggest lead of the game at 49-37, with one minute left. Cal Poly Pomona went on to seal a final score of 59-49. 
UCSD hit five of seven three-
pointers in the first half to take a 25-20 advan-tage into the second, but the Pomona defense — best in the CCAA — stepped it up, outscoring the Tritons 39-24 in the game’s final 20 minutes. 
Tarabilda converted 
six of nine from the floor, three of which were tri-ples. He also added four assists and two rebounds.
The Broncos entered 
the game with a league-low 54.4 points per game. They held the Tritons to just 49 points, their low-est output since scoring 46 points in a 22-point loss against Cal Poly 
Pomona on Dec. 5.
In spite of last week’s difficulties, 
Tarabilda said he was encouraged by the team’s progress.
“It was just some of the little 
things we didn’t do, and some things that didn’t go our way, or else we could have had two wins this week, ” Tarabilda said. “ As a team, we are definitely more confident, and have realized if we play like that every game — with high intensity and an empha-sis on the defensive end — we’re going to start winning some games. ”
UCSD will complete the four-
game home stand against Cal State Dominguez Hills on Feb. 4 and Cal State Los Angeles on Feb. 6.

Tritons trailing 69-68, Carlisle drained a clutch shot from well behind the three-point line to give UCSD the lead. The Tritons stopped Pomona on the final possession and hung on for the win.
“When we got down by 11, they 
began talking about getting stops and just kept fighting, ” head coach Charity Elliot said. “That was one of the crazi-est endings I’ve ever been a part of, and showed again how much fight this team has. ”  
In Saturday’s Spirit Night game, the 
Tritons played tremendous defense to shut down San Bernardino, winning 58-41 to a record women’s-basketball crowd of 2,020. UCSD was dominant from the start, and never conceded the lead after the first three minutes.
Game standout Tiffany Hunter 
scored a career-high 23 points and added 13 rebounds to complete the double-double. 
Aggressive defense on both sides 
characterized the first half, and the Coyotes held the Tritons to a low 27 points. However, up to the challenge, UCSD allowed San Bernardino only 23 first-half points, and took a four-point lead into the break.
The Tritons kept up the defensive 
intensity in the second half, keeping the Coyotes to 23 percent from the field.
“Even though we held them to 23 
points in the first half, I wasn’t very pleased with our defensive intensity, ” said Elliot. “ At halftime, I really chal-lenged them to raise the level on the defensive end, and I thought the sec-ond half was some of the best team defense we’ve played. ”
The Tritons also out-rebound-
ed  San Bernardino 46-30, thanks to Hunter’s 13 — and eight more by freshman guard Emily Osga.
UCSD was given an extra boost 
by the return of junior center Charity Smith, who played in her first game since Jan. 3. She contributed seven points and grabbed three rebounds in nine minutes on the court.The Tritons were also energized by 
the roar of the crowd, much larger than usual due to the Spirit Night draw.
“I think that the energy from my 
team and the crowd led the team and I to have such a great performance, ” said Hunter. “We fed off of the crowd, and it kept the game at a very intensi-fied level. ”
The wins brought UCSD to 17-1 
overall and 12-1 in conference play. The Tritons will shoot for another home victory at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, when they play Cal State Dominguez Hills at RIMAC arena.

The Tritons were looking for-
ward to playing on their home court after a difficult road trip 
the weekend before last.
They began a four-game home 
stand last week when they hosted Cal Poly Pomona on Jan. 28 and Cal State San Bernardino on Jan. 30. (The next two games will be Feb. 4 and Feb. 6). Pomona’s defense made the difference on Thursday, limiting the Tritons to just 49 points in a 59-49 victory.
Again on Saturday, as 3,860 fans 
packed into RIMAC Arena for Spirit Night, the Tritons couldn’t upset the Coyotes — now 13-4, 11-2 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play. A tight game ended in a nine-point deficit for UCSD, as Cal State San Bernardino won the game 76-67. The Tritons are now 4-12, 3-10 in CCAA.
“San Bernardino and Pomona are 
two of the best teams in our confer-ence, ” freshman guard Jake Tarabilda said. “We are bummed about the loss-es, because we were right there with both games, but if we play how we did this week, then we are definitely going to get some wins this second half of conference play. ”
The Tritons couldn’t catch up to 
the Coyotes, despite senior guard Jordan Lawley’s career-high 32 points 
— topping a previous best of 31 
points, set against San Francisco State on Jan. 16 — and a double-double by sophomore center Christian Hatch.
Lawley made eight of 16 shots 
from the floor, sinking three of four outside the arch. Twenty-four of his 32 shots came in the second half, and he tallied 22 of UCSD’s 25 points in 
the first.

After slipping three spots to No. 
10 in the Division-II national rankings, the UCSD women’s 
basketball team came up with two huge wins last week at RIMAC Arena.
The Tritons defeated Cal Poly 
Pomona on Thursday, Jan. 28 by a score of 71-69 after a clutch final-minute shot. The following Saturday, an excellent Triton defense dominated Cal State San Bernardino for a 58-41 win on UCSD’s annual Spirit Night.
The women went down to the 
wire with Pomona, requiring late-game heroics from sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle. Carlisle scored 22 points on eight-of-16 shooting, and had four assists and three steals — all team highs. Junior Tiffany Hunter added 17 points and eight rebounds to the Triton effort.
The Broncos came out fast, trying 
to push the tempo of the game, jump-ing to a 22-14 lead midway through the first half. However, the Tritons rallied to keep the game tight: Neither team was able to take more than an eight-point advantage.
Going into halftime, UCSD took 
a narrow 36-35 lead, after a pull-up jumper from senior guard Annette Ilg closed out the first half. 
Pomona rushed head first into the 
second half, successfully feeding the ball into the low post to go on a quick 8-2 run. The Broncos were physically dominant — 40 points in the paint with a plus-11 rebounding margin — and extended their lead to as much as 11 with 9:07 on the clock.
But the Tritons rallied once again, 
thanks mostly to Carlisle and Hunter, 
who scored 18 of the final 22 points. 
With 25 seconds remaining and the  As Saturday’s 
Spirit Night 
drew to a close, 
the basketball 
teams played
to a thunderous
stadium of
Proud
The Triton men were 
stifled on Spirit Night, losing to Cal State San Bernardino by nine.The women put on a defensive clinic in their 17-point victory, in front of a record crowd.
