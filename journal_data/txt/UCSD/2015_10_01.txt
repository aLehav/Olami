University officials announced 
that Geisel Library acquired the 
archive of Emmy Award-winning 
filmmaker Paul Espinosa on Sept. 
23. The Library will celebrate 
Espinosa’s works by hosting free, 
public screenings of his films in 
October and November.
Though multiple universities 
were interested in acquiring his 
archive — including Stanford, his 
alma mater — Espinosa told the 
UCSD Guardian that he felt it was 
important to donate it to a public 
university. 
“Public universities are the backbone of our public intellectual 
system, ” Espinosa said. “ As a 
filmmaker whose career has been 
dedicated to public broadcasting, the 
commitment of public universities 
to public inclusiveness and to open 
public discussion and education are 
key values for me. ”
Espinosa is best known for 
his documentaries about issues 
associated with the U.S.-Mexico 
border. He created many of these 
films while he was a member 
of KPBS, San Diego’s public 
broadcasting station.
According to the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, the archive contains 
about 200 boxes of scripts, letters, 
photos, interview transcripts and 
research materials from his 35 years of filmmaking. Espinosa’s archive 
joins those of other significant 
figures, such as medical researcher 
Jonas Salk and author Dr. Seuss.
Furthermore, Espinosa explained 
that UCSD’s proximity to the border, 
where much of his work takes place, 
made the university his first choice. 
“I felt it was important that my 
work remain closer to the border 
and to the region in which so much 
of it was created, ” Espinosa said. 
“Being on the U.S.-Mexico border 
gives San Diego an international 
dynamic, and there has been so 
much potential to work on untold 
stories. ”
Mandeville Special Collections AROUND CAMPUS
Full-Service Dining Hall 
to Open in Revelle College
UCSD Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
will be expanding the Revelle College 
dining hall 64 Degrees to include a full-
service restaurant this quarter. Called 64 North, 
this expansion is expected to open some time 
this Fall Quarter.
HDH Associate Director Steve Casad stated 
that the inspiration for the restaurant came 
from The Bistro, located on the opposite end 
of campus. 
“The concept of a table-service restaurant 
was largely preceded by the overwhelming 
success of The Bistro at the Strand on the 
north side of campus, and [by] the desire 
to have an easily accessible location on the 
south side of the campus, ” Casad said in a 
statement to the UCSD Guardian. “The cuisine 
is inspired by California’s regional flavors and 
themes, twisted with the inventive stylization of our Chef Ivan’s favorite international cuisine 
growing up abroad. ”
HDH had always planned to include a full 
table service restaurant in 64 North since its 
conception. However, the process of planning 
and building the dining hall began only 18 
months ago.
Casad explained in a statement that the cost 
and quality of the menu items will be similar to 
that of The Bistro.
“The facility will provide a full service-
dining experience similar to that of The Bistro, ” 
Casad said. “We feel the food and dining 
experience will be of great value to patrons. 
Desserts will be presented on a varied daily 
rotation at the table. Students, staff and faculty 
can look forward to a menu that takes a 
different take on typical dishes like salads,

Support For 
Fair Pay BillCALIFORNIA
Senate Bill 358 will mandate 
employer transparency and 
encourage employees to 
report wage inequality.
BY   J o s h   L e f l e r
Contributing Writer
See  BILL , page 3California’s Governor Jerry 
Brown recently stated his intent to 
sign Senate Bill 358, a gender-based 
fair-pay bill. Unanimously passed on 
Aug. 31, Senate Bill 358 expands the 
criteria for what constitutes gender-
based wage disparity and makes it 
easier for underpaid female workers 
to file complaints against employers. 
The main provision of this bill 
expands the definition of a wage gap 
between male and female employees.
Senate Bill 358 redefines a 
gender-based gap by “[eliminating] 
the requirement that the wage 
differential be within the same 
establishment.” It also defines a 
gender-based gap as “paying any 
of its employees at wage rates less 
than those paid to employees of 
the opposite sex for substantially 
similar work. ”
A difference in pay between 
male and female workers belonging 
to different job titles of similar 
workload, even of separate 
establishments, is now valid 
grounds for filing a complaint. 
Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson 
(D-Calif.), the bill’s primary author, 
claims this provision is necessary 
to eliminate the workarounds in 
current laws that have allowed wage 
disparities to exist.
“It means that female 
housekeepers who clean rooms 
could legally challenge higher 
wages of those males cleaning the 
lobby, ” Sen. Jackson said in a press 
conference regarding the bill. “We’re 
closing all the loopholes. ”
Additionally, the bill bans the 
employer practice of preventing 
employees from inquiring about 
and discussing the salaries they earn 
and encourages workers to exercise 
their rights within these terms.
According to Jennifer Reisch, 
Legal Director for Equal Rights 
Advocates and co-writer of the bill, 
this practice has kept many cases of 
wage disparity from coming to light. 
“Oftentimes workers don’t 
even know that there is pay 
discrimination because employers 
express or explicitly tell them that 
they can’t talk about compensation, ” 
Reisch told the UCSD Guardian.
The bill will enforce these new 
clauses by preventing employers 
from acting against or penalizing 
employees who have reason to 
invoke the bill’s provisions. 
Senate Bill 358 is not the first 
piece of legislation to tackle the issue 
of income inequality. The Equal Pay 
Act of 1963 also condemned the 
gender-wage gap on a federal level.

asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu 858.246.0972@ucsdguardianUCSD researchers released a 
design for a working invisibility 
cloak that has the ability to hide 
objects sitting on a flat surface 
this past July. Unlike previous 
designs, UCSD’s development of the 
technology has been called a new 
step toward invisibility. Principal 
Investigator and Engineering 
Professor Boubacar Kante is in the 
process of submitting a proposal to 
the U.S. Department of Defense. 
Kante told the UCSD Guardian 
that research focused on the efficiency 
and size of the cloaking device. 
“I knew the challenges in [this] 
area. When you wanted to cloak an 
object, the thing you had to put on top 
of it was too big, ” Kante said. “So we 
have been thinking of ways to decrease 
the size of these cloaking devices. ”
After putting together a team, 
the group used computer-aided 
design software to model the designs 
and simulate how the cloak would interact with electromagnetic waves. 
When starting this project, Kante 
acquired the help of both graduate 
and undergraduate students 
in the electrical and computer    
engineering departments. 
“It’s really important for students 
to be involved in research so they 
can be exposed to ideas and can 
[contribute] ideas, ” Kante said. “We 
have three [undergraduate] students 
who are coming to group meetings 
and working on the project. ”
In most previous attempts, 
the reflected light from the cloak 
was dimmer than the light that 
had hit the surface, leading to a 
noticeable difference in intensities.
These cloaks were referred to as 
“lossy” because they lose light or    
brightness as it reflects back to the 
viewer. However, the new research 
avoids this issue.
“What we have achieved in this 
study is a ‘lossless’ cloak, ” Kante 
told UCSD News Center. “It won’t 
lose any intensity of the light that 
it reflects. ” 
The team’s goal was to scatter the waves of both light and radar 
to render the object without 
diminishing the intensity of light 
being reflected. To accomplish this, 
the researchers used a thin sheet 
of teflon and ceramic cylinders of 
differing sizes, which results in these 
cloaks being significantly lighter 
and thinner than earlier versions. 
In the device, the differing heights 
of the cylinders worked to control 
the light over a surface and reduce 
an object’s shadow. Their project 
was specifically a “carpet cloak, ” 
meaning it was set over an object 
lying on a flat surface but appeared 
to reflect a flat surface. 
Besides applications in the 
defense industry, this technology 
has implications for the energy 
industry as well. Kante explained 
to the Guardian that their research 
could help eliminate the need for 
solar cells and mirrors to track with 
the sun and could make energy 
collection more efficient. 
“We could use this type of device 
to improve solar cells or collect light 
from the sun and focus that light to a line or point, ” Kante said. “ Also, 
cosmetic and design companies are 
interested in using [these] devices 
to make objects look different than 
they are. ”
Kante discussed the idea that, 
though the idea of invisibility is 
inconceivable today, technological 
advances like his team’s could 
expedite the process of actualization.
“Invisibility may seem like magic 
at first, but its underlying concepts 
are familiar to everyone. All it 
requires is a clever manipulation 
of our perception,” Kante told 
the UCSD News Center. “Full 
invisibility still seems beyond reach 
today, but it might become a reality 
in the near future, thanks to recent 
progress in cloaking devices. ”
The team’s conclusions were 
published in the Progress In 
Electromagnetics Research, a 
journal for peer-reviewed papers 
dealing with electromagnetic waves. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

WEEK ONELibrary Director Lynda Claassen 
described how Espinosa’s works 
matched up well with the Library’s 
interests in the border region.
“We partnered up with Paul 
because he creates films that address 
important issues of Chicano history 
and activism, areas in which the 
Library tries to collect primary 
research materials, ” Claassen told 
the Guardian. “The interviews 
and research Paul did in collecting 
material for his films, much of which didn’t make its way into the 
films, will now become materials 
that students and researchers can 
utilize in their own work. ”
University Librarian Brian 
Schottlaender hopes that having 
Espinosa’s archive at UCSD will 
inspire students to continue and 
to expand upon the topics of his 
works.
“He has deep roots in the 
community and on the campus, ” 
Schottlaender told the Guardian. 
“We hope to help increase awareness of some of the important cross-
cultural issues that Paul’s work has 
highlighted. ”
UCSD will kick off Espinosa’s 
film series on Oct. 10 with an 
opening reception at Geisel Library. 
Film screenings will take place on 
Oct. 23 at the Cross Cultural Center, 
on Nov. 4 at Digital Gym Cinema 
and on Nov. 10 at the Museum of 
Photographic Arts.denoting that no employer  “shall 
discriminate ... between employees 
on the basis of sex by paying wages 
to employees ... less than the rate at 
which [the employer] pays wages to 
employees of the opposite sex ... for 
equal work. ” 
Senate Bill 358 aims to enforce 
the illegality of wage discrimination 
by emphasizing transparency from 
the beginning of the hiring process 
for all employees. Despite that declaration, women 
in California today earn 84 percent 
of what men do for substantially 
similar jobs, based on a 2014 
study conducted by the American 
Association of University Women.
In tandem with Senate Bill 358, 
state lawmakers are currently working 
on two other equal pay bills. Assembly 
Bill 1017 would prohibit employers 
from asking a potential employee 
about their previous salary histories. 
If passed, the bill would be the first 
and only one of its kind in the U.S. The second bill, Assembly Bill 
1354, would require contractors 
working in the state to comply 
with current equal pay legislation. 
This bill would mandate that all 
potential contractors submit a 
nondiscrimination program to 
the California Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing and 
continue to submit annual progress 
reports even after approval.chef-inspired special featured daily. ”
In addition to the table service 
restaurant, Casad mentioned that 
HDH has plans to make changes to 
dining halls all over campus such 
as Roots in Muir College, Goody’s 
in Thurgood Marshall College and 
Foodworx in Sixth College.
“Roots has revised offerings, 
Goody’s has put together an 
artisan breakfast burrito and HDH 
has partnered with Eco Grounds 
to produce [a] special coffee line, Triton Blend, which will benefit the 
Triton Food Pantry, ” Casad said. 
“In addition, Foodworx has revised 
offerings and a new enclosed seating 
area. Also, food trucks are rotating 
through campus residential areas. ”
Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior Max Donovan told the 
Guardian he was excited about the                                 
64 North expansion. 
“I think it’s great that they’re 
expanding the dining hall, ” Donovan 
said. “There is a good variation in 
the food they serve and it’s different 
from other dining halls. ” Casad expressed similar 
optimism, saying that HDH expects 
a positive reaction to the new  
dining hall.
“We have confidence that 
students, staff, and faculty alike 
will greatly enjoy the first bites 
of whatever selection they make, ” 
Casad said. “It is our goal to ensure 
that food is enjoyed with careful 
balance in seasoning and [with] the 
natural flavors that are inherent. ”HDH Plans to Expand Menu Offerings at Several Dining Halls

Guest Column: 
Government 
Is Failing to 
Fund Higher 
Education
California has hit its lowest point 
in tax support for public higher 
education since 1962. States now put 
less than half as much per capita as 
the feds put into higher education. 
Kentucky, Mississippi, Louisiana, New 
Mexico and West Virginia are five 
poor states that have put forth more 
tax effort than California, despite 
its wealth. In 1972 when the federal 
government took over, it was stated 
that if federal assistance would be 
made available to the private sector of 
higher education, Stanford University 
would become like UCLA. What’s 
happened is that UCLA has become 
like Stanford, and public Illinois 
universities have become like the 
University of Chicago. Twenty states 
cut their higher education budget 
to the very threshold of where the 
federal penalties kick in, and they 
wouldn’t cross it.
There are nearly 200 for-profit 
institutions of higher education 
operating in California today. They 
all live off of public money. They’re 
trying to change a 90/10 rule in 
W ashington which says they need to 
get at least 10 percent of their money 
from other sources than direct student 
aid. That just shows you how bad 
it’s gotten. Having Janet Napolitano, 
a former Cabinet Secretary, as UC 
President isn’t helping at all. 
If we’re going to be committed 
as a wealthy state to supporting our 
students, we need to rethink how 
we’re funding higher education and 
reward the institutions that are doing 
a good job and actively pursuing 
public interest — those that are 
keeping expenditures relatively low, 
keeping costs relatively low, keeping 
student indebtedness low — all of the 
things that matter to our taxpayers, to 
our students and to their parents.
According to the legislators, the 
University of Virginia in Richmond is 
known as the University of New Jersey 
at Charlottesville because they have 
40 percent out-of-state undergraduate 
students. They’re simply turning away 
in-state students. They’re not serving 
in-state students, nor are they serving 
students who receive Pell Grants. 
They have, in fact, privatized along 
with the University of Michigan and 
a number of other institutions. The 
perfect storm for UCSD is that the UC 
system admitted 16,000 international 
students to the class of 2019. 
It’s a revenue problem and a 
spending problem that can’t be 
fixed by only looking at California’s 
perspective. It’s a very different 
manifestation depending on different 
types of institutions, so we can’t expect 
the research diagnosis of a private 
university to apply to a community 
college. The data says we must be 
nuanced in this conversation. The 
data says that we have a public policy 
problem and an institutional spending 
problem in public institutions. Y et 
the habits of state funding and the 
patterns of state appropriations are a 
big part of the problem. 
Y ou can be a Republican or 
you can be a Democrat, but we 
have legislators that are on both 
sides of the aisles. Every one of 
them says that they are supportive 
of education, that it’s one of their 
top-three priorities. And every one 
of them was the first to sign onto 
budgets that have decimated our 
public schools and are in the process 
of decimating higher education. BY RICHARD THOMPSON
In a triumphant moment for 
women’s equality, the state Senate 
passed an Equal Pay bill on Aug. 
31 to refresh some old laws in 
desperate need of an update. Gov. 
Jerry Brown has since indicated 
his intention to sign the bill, 
SB-358, as well, according to ABC. 
SB-358 promotes transparency and 
communication between employees 
and their employers regarding 
wages. Sadly, the bill does not 
automatically mean that women 
and men will have equal paychecks, 
although it is currently one of the 
strongest efforts in California to 
combat the gender wage gap.
In 2013, women in California 
were paid an average of 84 cents for 
every dollar a man made, reported 
the San Diego Union-Tribune. The 
bill aims to mitigate this issue. 
Part of the bill prohibits employers 
from forcing workers to keep their 
wages a secret, allowing for men 
and women to more easily compare 
their salaries without risking a 
lawsuit. Previously, employers could 
require their workers to waive the 
right to tell other people about 
their wages.
While existing laws prevent 
employers from paying different 
wages for similar work in the 
same establishment, SB-358 has 
expanded this to include separate 
establishments. This allows women 
to compare their wages to those of men who do similar work, albeit 
in a slightly different environment. 
For example, a woman working 
as a teacher at an elementary 
school can now ask her employer 
why a male teacher working at 
a different school is paid more. 
There is no need for their jobs to 
be identical either, as long as they 
are responsible for “substantially 
similar work, ” as the bill states.
If an employer is discovered to 
pay a male employee more than a 
female employee, they may be held 
accountable for explaining why. 
There must be a “bona fide factor 
other than sex” for paying a man 
more than a woman. To prove that 
the wage gap is not due to gender, 
the employer may reference systems 
that measure differences in merit, 
education, training, experience, 
seniority or quality of work. 
An important aspect of the 
bill allows women to ask their 
employers how much money they 
are paying other people in the 
company. This is significant because 
women need protections which 
allow them to be assertive and 
inquisitive. A survey by Pay Scale 
found that 31 percent of women are 
uncomfortable negotiating salaries, 
compared to 23 percent of men. 
In an interview with CNBC, Laura 
Kray, a professor of leadership at 
the UC Berkeley’s Haas School 
of Business, said, “to [negotiate] requires being assertive, taking 
initiative, probably taking out your 
list of accomplishments and thereby 
self-promoting. It turns out people 
don’t like it when women do this. ” 
It is likely that some women do not 
negotiate for higher salaries for fear 
of being penalized or perceived 
as too aggressive. That’s why it 
is crucial that this bill prevents 
employers from punishing women’s 
questions about their salaries.
However, the ultimate flaw in 
this new bill is the protection given 
to employers, allowing them to 
keep secrets about their workers’ 
wages. Oh sure, a woman can 
now ask her boss what her male 
co-worker is earning. Although 
she’s protected from being 
retaliated against under SB-358, 
this in no way obligates her boss 
to give an answer. Sec. 2 of SB-358 
says, “nothing in this section creates 
an obligation to disclose wages. ”
Everything about this bill 
claims to promote transparency, 
communication and no more 
secrets — except for the boss. 
Female employees have regained 
the right to discuss wages and 
actually question the value of their 
wages, but the right to receive 
an answer to their questions is 
tactfully omitted from the bill. The 
next step to fixing the wage gap 
is developing the guts to demand 
answers.Equal Pay Bill Fails to Provide Answers for Salary Comparisons

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the 
University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2014. Views expressed herein represent the majority 
vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily those 
of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or the 
members of the Guardian staff. UCSD strikes a $30 Million Deal with MTS to 
rename a trolley line to “UC San Diego Blue Line.” 
The Ed Board doubts this will be money well spent.Crossing the Blue Line
See TROLLEY , page 5Anyone who’s walked around UCSD knows 
that public transportation is a necessity, but 
students can also attest to the difficulty of 
exploring San Diego via bus. We’re all for saving money 
on gas and being environmentally friendly — but not if 
it takes half a lifetime to get from UCSD to Old Town. 
So when the news broke out that UCSD and the San 
Diego Metropolitan Transit System would be extending 
the MTS Blue Line, we were naturally thrilled about 
the plan to create more efficient routes and convenient 
stops — and not at all bitter that current students will 
most likely not be here to see the fruits of their labor. 
But this is where the praise stops. 
Over the summer, UCSD struck a $30 million deal 
with MTS to change the name of the trolley line to 
“UC San Diego Blue Line” and to name three of the 
stations. Additionally, UCSD will have the right to 
advertise on rail bridges over Interstate 5 and Genesee 
Avenue. University Community Planning Group Chair 
Janay Kruger asserted that this was a “backroom deal” 
with no community input. 
According to Kruger, San Diego displays few signs 
because it can seem “cluttered, ” and UCSD is failing to take that into consideration. MTS Spokesperson 
Rob Schupp rebutted that there will be little exposure 
to the San Diego community — so UCSD wants to 
advertise to UCSD? That makes sense. San Diego 
Community Planners Committee Chair Joe LaCava 
affirmed the lack of communication and stated that 
there was a “disconnect” between his committee and 
MTS. The deal happened alarmingly fast. It sounds like 
yet another case of UCSD not taking its constituents’ 
interests into account — and even beyond that, UCSD 
is not being a good neighbor. Apparently this is MTS 
and UCSD’s world, and we’re just living in it. 
Besides the fact that UCSD and MTS have been 
extremely shady, they are also potentially confusing 
bus riders. Kruger and some MTS board members 
have expressed concern over the renaming of the bus 
stops. For example, part of the deal mandates that the 
Old Town stop will be renamed to “Old Town UC San 
Diego Health Campus South. ” UCSD is miles away 
from Old Town, and this name change will confuse 
passengers, especially since there are multiple stops 
between Old Town and UCSD. Also, could that station 
name be any more wordy?ILLUSTRATION BY ELYSE YANGTo “appease” the natives, MTS 
has agreed to make a presentation 
at a board meeting explaining the 
details of the signage, including 
showing sketches and models. 
Note that there doesn’t seem to 
be any intention of listening to 
the community’s interests. LaCava 
admits that “When you’re excluded 
from the conversation, you imagine 
the worst. Then you’re forced to 
participate in a board meeting, 
which is the wrong place to have 
a conversation. ” MTS and UCSD 
are trying to placate already-
disgruntled (and rightly so) 
residents and board members.
 Again, it just sounds like administration is making decisions 
without caring about the people 
it serves. Here’s UCSD logic: Let’s 
make decisions, then when we’ve 
angered everyone, let’s vaguely 
show people what we’re doing. It 
doesn’t really matter that they’re 
showing us because we’re just going 
to see it in five years when this 
project is complete. 
Also, let’s not ignore the enormous 
price tag on these naming rights — 
$30 million is a ridiculous amount to 
pay, though this money comes from 
the UCSD Health marketing budget, 
not public funds. UCSD is pulling 
a Snoop Dogg and dropping it — 
money — like it’s hot. As students, we 
are curious about how our university 
is spending its money and hope that it is doing so wisely. However, this 
does not seem like a worthwhile 
investment. Rather, it seems like an 
attempt to brand and sell ourselves. 
Y ou shouldn’t play hot potato with 
$30 million, and hopefully UCSD will 
realize that eventually. 
Although the UCSD Guardian 
Editorial Board welcomes the Blue 
Line trolley extension project, MTS 
and UCSD’s shady behavior makes 
us question their decisions. Going 
forward, we hope that UCSD and 
MTS will make wise decisions 
about this project and that student 
and community needs will be taken 
into account. Believe it or not, 
UCSD does not exist in a bubble, 
and it’s time that the powers that be 
recognize this and act on that fact. OPINION  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY , OCTOBER 1, 2015 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  5

You are sitting in a darkened room, surrounded by a couple dozen people patiently waiting for the 
reading to start. Just like you, they are here on this Sunday night to share their thoughts, opinions and 
feelings, listen to poetry and get inspired. The setting is reminiscent of the literary salons that used to 
be popular during 17th-century France. But there are no women in intricately decorated court dresses and 
no men wearing cravats and powdered wigs — instead, the guests are dressed in T-shirts, pants and denim 
jackets. There are no chandeliers or paintings in gilded frames — all you can see in the room are shelves 
with magazines, Converses and Birkenstocks. And no, this is not Paris — this is North Park, one of the most 
vibrant districts of contemporary San Diego.
Like many other North Park-based projects, Non-Standard Lit, a literary soiree series, is a result of brilliant 
collaboration of the local cordon bleus. Two poets and writers, Adam Stutz and Mark Wallace, come together 
with Gym Standard, a shoe and magazine store, Elevator Teeth and Digital Gym, a nonprofit theater, to deliver 
the ultimate literary experience to San Diego residents. In this unique quintet, everyone does their bit: Gym 
Standard, which often hosts a variety of local events, serves as a space for the readings, while Adam and Mark 
look for poets and writers to read their work and come up with each Non-Standard Lit’s topic. Justin Fogle, 
aka Elevator Teeth, prepares posters, and Digital Gym provides chairs to accommodate the 25 to 30 guests.
Thanks to the effective cooperation within this power team, San Diegans get an opportunity to familiarize 
themselves with both local poets and prose writers and authors from all over the United States. Previously, 
Non-Standard Lit hosted Hanna Andrews and Eryn Green, both of whom are poets and professors from 
Denver; Ben Doller, a UCSD professor and author of three poetry books; Rae Armantrout, a Pulitzer Prize 
winner from San Diego and many other literary artists. All of these authors are performing out-of-pocket to 
do far-from-standard readings, which allows all literary gatherings to be free and open to the public. 
Following yet another salon tradition, literary nights at Gym Standard are accompanied by post-
reading discussions at Tiger Tiger, a bar located on the next block, since good conversations 
never take place on an empty stomach and are even better if accompanied by alcohol.
This public reading at a shoe store (stock up on your gym sneakers!) may first seem like 
an avant-garde venue to host a literary recital, but when you have two leading writers 
in the lineup, you can only expect the event to take off running. This Saturday, Marco 
Anthony Huerta and Roman Lujan, both acclaimed poets and translators of Latino 
descent, will be kicking off the fall reading at Non-Standard Lit. If Huerta sounds 
like a familiar name, it’s because he is a second-year MFA candidate at UCSD’s 
creative writing department. After “killing his lyrical self, ” Huerta’s creative texts 
are formed on the basis of appropriation: He creates them through Wikipedia 
pages, books and various source documents, re-inventing the words to find 
new meaning. Like Huerta, Lujan is a Mexican poet and literary translator 
based in Southern California. The extensive list of his works, which include two 
anthologies of Mexican poetry and Twitter posts, written mainly in Spanish, 
make it obvious that Roman Lujan is devoted to writing in the language of 
his ancestors, while currently residing in Los Angeles — where he is currently 
working on his doctorate at UCLA. What language will the poet choose for his 
Gym Standard recital? Find out on Sunday, Oct. 4, at 5 p.m.
Non-Standard Lit is a truly exceptional event that can turn your Sunday night 
into a 21st-century salon experience, all free of charge.WEEKEND

Y ou’ve said before that you enjoy being the underdog. 
How has that influenced you and/or your music?
I think that’s been a huge part of our live show [and] 
has influenced our live show. Over the past year and a half, we’ve been 
opening (this is our first ever headline tour) and in that situation you have 
a unique scenario where you’re seen as the underdog. And it’s your job to 
craft their crowd. I think the staple of the opening band being this way has 
made a difference that’s evolved and ramped up the energy of our live show 
over the past few years. Guardian:
Paul Brenner:
You’ve also mentioned that you like “taking the 
audience hostage. ” What do you mean by that, and what 
should audiences expect? 
There’s a time when you’re 
just an opener for another act — which is 
great and a right of passage for any band — 
but I think what Dan meant by that is how 
we have the ability to threaten — without 
sounding too violent about it — the 
crowd. Y ou’re going to enjoy this. We’re 
not gonna be fazed. Guardian:
Paul Brenner:
What was it like to collaborate 
with Big Data on “Dangerous” and to see the 
response from that song? 
That collaboration was actually 
originally just Dan and Alan Wilkis from Big Data; they 
actually had a thing together. Dan and Alan would get together while 
Dan’s girlfriend was at work and they would just have fun creating 
songs. I don’t think either one of them knew that “Dangerous” would 
do what it did. I don’t think any of us did, you know, and Joywave 
was taking off at the same moment and Dan couldn’t be in two places 
at once. So Alan put together a band. The “featuring Joywave” was 
changed retroactively. Guardian:
Paul Brenner:To see a song like that take off the way it did, what was the 
reaction from the band and how does that influence you going forward? 
It’s crazy. It has done nothing but good things for Big 
Data and for us. It was so crazy to see that go number one. I remember at 
Lollapalooza last summer, Dan was going around to different interview 
tents and whatnot and everyone was like “What’s it like to be the voice of 
the number-one song on the radio?” Like I said earlier, it’s all been kind of 
a rollercoaster. I don’t think anyone expected this — it’s done nothing but 
good things.Guardian:

INTERVIEW BY PETER MCINNIS // STAFF WRITERJoywave brings the deﬁance and dynamic energy 
of its live show to The Casbah this September.I think our hometown of 
Rochester means a lot to all of us. We were all 
born and raised in a tiny little suburb outside of 
Rochester, and if it weren’t for the city and for 
all our parents working for Kodak company... 
We kind of owe a lot indirectly to Kodak 
and to our neighborhoods in general. Our 
first album was called “Koda Vista, ” which 
is actually the name of the neighborhood 
that I grew up in. There’s nothing like 
practicing in our parents’ basement 
for days. We all just owe a lot to the 
geography at that point, you know?  Paul Brenner:
If you guys were to cover any song live, which artist and which 
song would you choose? Y ou personally, of course. 
Over the years we’ve done some pretty cool covers that 
I’ve enjoyed. A long time ago we did “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” 
by Tears for Fears and I really loved that one. We’ve covered “When Y ou 
Were Y oung” by The Killers a long time ago as well. Recently we’ve prepared 
a cover as well, but I’m not going to reveal that. I’ll leave that a surprise. Guardian:

by  BOY  &  BEAR
Release Date Oct. 2 Release Date Oct. 9
The Birmingham five-piece steps it up with 
synths on an impressive sophomore record.   Boy & Bear follows in Mumford & Sons’ footsteps, ditching the 
acoustics and demonstrating new-rock style in latest album.ALBUM   REVIEW ALBUM   REVIEW
Mellow indie rockers Swim 
Deep were once the poster 
boys for the carefree: 
easygoing, bubblegum-haired twenty-
somethings draped in thrift shop 
sweaters, deftly navigating the B-town 
scene on beat-up skateboards. If 
their debut, “Where In The Heaven 
Are We, ” was a distillment of the 
feel-good themes of B-town — an 
indie pop scene bred by the likes of 
Peace and JAWS in Birmingham, 
England — then their sophomore 
record “Mothers” is perhaps a more-
articulated version of the same setting. 
Swim Deep has revived the airy, guitar-
based sound that wooed early fans, but 
their metamorphosis hasn’t been one 
of complete renewal; Swim Deep has 
simply become more meticulous.
The hazy vocals and melodic 
guitars of early Swim Deep tracks have 
not been removed and replaced, just 
buried. “Mothers” layers the airy 80’s 
dream pop of “Where In The Heaven 
Are We” with jangly guitars and 
heavy synths, producing a complex 
psychedelic pop-grunge that selectively 
emphasizes and muffles varying layers 
to create an array of distinctive songs. 
The album opens with “One Great 
Song And I Could Change the World, ” 
a grand proposal lathered in soft  
vocals and synths that demands high 
expectations, just to fall short of them. 
Sure, “Mothers” is a delicious listen, but 
it suits a peaceful summer kickback far 
more than it does global revolution.
But Swim Deep’s introductory 
proposition lays the foundation for what they’ve set out to accomplish 
with their sophomore record: change. 
Surely anthems “To My Brother” and 
“Is There Anybody Out There” won’t 
be mistaken for the guitar-driven, indie 
jingles of their past; synths mingle with 
keyboards to stifle delicate vocals, 
lifting only to pronounce catchy, 
single-phrase choruses. 
Y et, such a persistent reliance on 
synths poses the danger of occasional 
monotony and Swim Deep doesn’t 
completely escape it. “Heavenly 
Moment” and “Imagination” fail to 
offer anything exclusive; they depend 
on the same heavy synth and obscured 
vocal combination of the other tracks 
but lack any of their redeeming 
embellishments. Fortunately, “Fueiho 
Boogie” revives a late-album slump. 
The eight-minute closer recovers the 
clever lyrics and striking guitar riffs of 
their earlier work and fuses them with 
carefully layered instrumentation 
and amplified vocals. The result is 
a lengthy showcase of Swim Deep’s 
ability to fine-tune. 
“Mothers” is just that — a careful 
modification of an original sound, a 
rare achievement of simultaneous 
experimentation and perfection. 
Swim Deep may remain a beacon for 
the blissful and carefree, but “Mothers” 
has demonstrated the existence of an 
underlying ambitiousness.

A&E EditorLeaving the banjo-plucking and acoustic guitar hooks 
behind, Boy & Bear finds a different sound in its 
newest album. Championing the indie, folk-rock 
vibe, Boy & Bear established itself in the Australian music 
community in 2011 with “Moonfire. ” Their folk, singer-
songwriter style lifted the band from obscurity when their 
first album reached No. 2 in their home country. Its next 
effort, “Harlequin Dream” (2013), represents a step in the 
evolution of its sound, showing off more synthesizer and 
electric guitar riffs. In a commentary on the title song of the 
album, the band notes that “Harlequin Dream” illustrates 
“a new direction. ” Their development takes another leap 
forward as they redefine their sound in their third album, 
“Limit of Love. ” 
The 11-track album begins with a heavier rock feel in 
“W alk the Wire” and “Where’ d Y ou Go, ” but the album evolves 
to feature synthesizer in “ A Thousand Faces” and mellow 
electric guitar solos in “Hollow Ground” and “Just Dumb. ” 
Throughout most of “Limit of Love, ” a consistent pulsing 
rhythm underlays its new tone, adding depth to its tracks. 
Steady, repetitive percussion opens up the album in the first 
track and returns to provide a foundation for the intense 
atmosphere of “Showdown. ” A glimpse of the old singer-
songwriter feel can be found in “Fox Hole, ” the concluding 
track on the album. However, its depressing themes evoke 
a sense of loss rather than the upbeat dreamers who went 
“dancing in the garden” and sang of “Golden Jubilee[s]” on 
“Moonfire. ” Gone are the folksy romantics from the cute and 
catchy “Shape of Love, ” a 2010 single with Passenger. “Limit 
of Love” spells out a clear change in sound, at times leaving 
listeners hoping for the return of the old banjo vibe because 
an occasional overuse of synths subtracts from its original 
acoustic appeal. 
Boy & Bear uses the stronger, alt-rock vibe to support 
themes of anger, sadness and loss. As the title suggests, the 
album reflects a fight and the ensuing passion, disagreement 
and loneliness. Known for its evocative lyrics, Boy & Bear 
encapsulates the fear and confusion of an unraveling relationship with the metaphor of “W alk[ing] the Wire” 
together in the pre-released single. “Showdown” changes 
the atmosphere, elevating the tension with slow, methodical 
drum beats and sustained organ in the background. 
The powerful instrumentation supports the feeling of 
confrontation and the culmination of passion and anger. 
“Limit of Love” clearly presents Boy & Bear’s musical growth 
as they develop their sound to a more alternative rock style, 
while still staying true to their lyrical depth. Even though 
many will flock to their new album with excitement at the 
development, some devoted Boy & Bear fans are likely to 
nostalgically revisit “Moonfire” instead of “Limit of Love. ”

OCT. 1st       3–5 PM VILLAGE CONFERENCE ROOMS
FREE FOOD AND DRINKSfromListeners could barely distinguish frontman Van McCann’s vocals amid the roar of fans. They sang every word to the 
Llandudno band’s debut album “The Balcony” at their energetic and suspenseful House of Blues performance.CONCERT   REVIEW
The lights dimmed and a 
crowd ranging from Dr. 
Martens-clad high-school 
fangirls to middle-aged music nerds 
surged forward in anticipation of a 
band that chose to remain backstage. 
Catfish and the Bottlemen like to 
tease, having taunted fans with late 
stage times in the past. But on Sept. 
26, at the San Diego House of Blues, 
they played a different trick entirely. 
A muffled speech came through the 
speakers and strobe lights flashed 
before the lights flickered back on 
and the audio stopped. Confused 
fans screamed and the lights 
dimmed again. If Van McCann, 
Catfish and the Bottlemen’s 
vivacious frontman, hadn’t been 
involved in the production, the 
intermittent lighting and sporadic 
audio may have been attributed to 
technical difficulties.
But McCann, the clever, 
Cheshire-born 23-year-old with a 
knack for grabbing the audience’s 
attention, was most likely snickering 
backstage somewhere, marveling at 
his ability to so thoroughly conduct 
the energy of a room his band had 
managed to fill. Once the trick had 
played out for a few minutes, the 
lights remained off and Catfish and 
the Bottlemen strolled onto the 
stage, jumping right into a high-
energy instrumental intro filled with 
crashing guitars and flashing lights. 
“Good evenin’ San Diego, this one’s 
called ‘Rango’ , ” McCann interrupted 
before launching into an animated opener that would set the pace for 
the rest of the night.
The opening stunt was a 
success, thrilling fans and eliciting 
participation that lasted throughout 
the performance. But it wasn’t 
necessary to fully excite the audience 
for the headlining performance — 
opening act Jamie N Commons had 
easily managed to draw the crowd 
into a sing-along with a compelling 
blend of grungy guitars, intelligent 
lyrics and raspy vocals.
After “Rango, ” McCann held still 
for just a moment before the band 
slipped into “Pacifier, ” a snarl-fueled 
banger with an adolescent flair. He 
introduced the members of the 
band, pointing to the curly-haired 
drummer in the back and presenting 
him as Sideshow Bob, offering a 
glimpse of the band’s refusal to take 
themselves too seriously.
The stage lighting only 
heightened the band’s energy, 
coming to an electrifying climax 
during “Business. ” McCann entered 
a frenzied state, violently strumming 
his guitar and parading between 
band members before coming to 
a halt with his feet on the edge of 
the stage. Under a single spotlight 
he sneered, “If you’ve been havin’ 
doubts at all/ Then you can come and 
mess my bed up/ And I can change 
your marital set-up” to fans who 
sang along until smashing guitar 
riffs and inebriating strobe lights 
revived the rowdy atmosphere. An 
unexpected injection of R. Kelly’s “Ignition (Remix)” late in the song 
increased the liveliness of the room 
and alluded to the true extent of the 
band’s musical dexterity. 
Singles “Kathleen” and “Cocoon” 
garnered the expected levels of 
praise from fans, but may have been 
better left to the highly anticipated 
encore that never came. Catfish and 
the Bottlemen keep their set lists 
short — they’ve only released one album and refuse to play covers. 
But there’s something delicious 
about the frustration brought on 
by the succinct set of songs, which 
suggests McCann may be playing 
another one of his tricks. Catfish 
and the Bottlemen have perfected 
their live shows, understanding that 
the best performances are short and 
dynamic.
As the lights turned back on following the boisterous closer 
“Tyrants, ” the audience lingered 
near the front of the stage, 
impatiently awaiting songs that 
wouldn’t be played. Yes, McCann’s 
tricks had worked: smitten fans 
would certainly be back for more.

WE ARE LOCATED AT PRICE CENTER EAST, LEVEL 4A.S. OFFICE OF
STUDENT ADVOCACYwere getting at us, ” UCSD Head Coach 
Jon Pascale told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “We did a pretty good 
job not giving them too many shots at 
the goal, though. We had some great 
moments on the attack [as well], and 
our set pieces looked dangerous. ”
Game Two
However, the Tritons’ luck ended 
on Sunday against Cal State Stanislaus. 
After giving up two goals in a span of 
two minutes in the last 12 minutes of 
play, UCSD ultimately fell in a 2–1 to 
the Warriors — its first home-turf loss 
since playing Cal Poly Pomona last 
September.
The Tritons notched the first goal up on the board after just 28 seconds 
of play when junior midfielder Riley 
Harbour scored off a touch from 
de la Cal. Their good fortune didn’t 
last, though — the remainder of the 
game was mired in missed chances to 
score. In the 61st minute, sophomore 
defender Kyle Panganiban sent a free 
kick toward the box. Harbour was 
there to receive, but his header shot 
back off the right post. The team 
missed yet another chance in the 72nd 
with an ill-placed shot that flew just to 
the left of the goal.
The Warriors staged a comeback 
starting in the 79th minute. 
Sophomore defender Luis Hernandez 
hit a backward shot off the inside of 
the post to level the score at 78:17, and senior midfielder Jose Ramirez 
sent his sixth goal of the season 
home less than two minutes later to 
give Stanislaus the win.
“We just didn’t put away a couple 
[of] chances, ” Head Coach Pascale 
said. “We left four quality chances on 
the table, we didn’t execute and we 
gave the other team an opportunity 
to get back in it — and they did. ”
The Tritons are on the road in 
two tough matchups this upcoming 
weekend — they will face off against 
No. 14 Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Friday and unranked Cal State Los 
Angeles on Sunday. Kings Look to Build Skill, Team Dynamic
B side for Tuesday’s practice, with 
guard Darren Collison lining up 
with forward Rudy Gay and center 
DeMarcus Cousins on the A side. The 
Kings were playing on an 18-second 
shot-clock, down from the classic 
24 seconds, which was probably 
a testament to their intention to 
playing fast. Cousins looked sharp, 
netting a couple of threes and a long-
range jumper.
“I played a lot of four today, but I 
also played five, ” Cousins said. “We 
got a lot of different looks of different 
lineups. The ball is moving well. ”
When asked how nice it was to 
have shooters around him, Cousins 
answered, “I’m a shooter. ”
Coach Karl looked enthusiastic 
about the prospect of coaching a 
team full of talent but warned not to 
underestimate the toughness of the 
Western Conference.
“There are a lot of good teams in 
the west, ” Karl said. “These are all 
great players with good skills, and 
they are all challenging themselves. 
Once we started playing five-on-
five, some of the things we wanted to 
improve on, we improved on. I can’t 
deny it — I thought it was a pretty 
good practice. ”
Some of the youngsters finished 
practice early and sat down to talk to 
the media. Forward Willie Cauley-
Stein, the sixth overall pick in the 
2015 draft, and guard Seth Curry, 
answered a few questions about the 
team and what they were expecting 
from training camp.
“We’re polar opposites, ” Cauley-
Stein said, when asked about his 
collaboration with Cousins. “That’s 
how you complement each other. He’s 
going to do things I don’t do, and I’ll 
do things he doesn’t do, so we’re going 
to mesh together perfectly. ” 
“It’s a nice gym, [RIMAC Arena], ” 
Curry said. “There is a lot of space, so it’s fun being out here. We really just 
see the hotel room and the gym and 
that’s it. ”
Cousins also highlighted the 
fact that this was probably one of 
the oldest teams he’ d ever be on, 
considering he had led previous 
Kings teams that were among the 
youngest in the NBA. The addition of 
veterans like Rondo, forward Caron 
Butler and guard Marco Belinelli 
and the presence of veteran forwards 
Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi could 
help this team be something special. 
Coach Karl insisted on the abundance 
of high-quality players he had at his 
disposition, saying he could have a 
10-men rotation and still have good 
players waiting on the bench. 
“It sounds all good to say ‘I am 
the leader of this team, ’” Cousins 
said. “But in order for this team to 
work, we need everybody in this 
team. It’s going to be about my voice, 
Rondo’s voice, Rudy’s voice, even 
some of the rookies’ . ”
The Kentucky connection is 
strong in the Kings’ roster, with 
Rondo, Cousins and Cauley-Stein all 
coming from there. This will perhaps 
help this team build a good playing 
dynamic, better than those of the 
previous seasons that saw coaches 
get fired, most recently Mike Malone, 
and management turned over. In the 
end, all that matters this week for 
the Kings is practice, some rest and 
team-building.
“We’re doing a couple of things 
with the team here in San Diego, ” 
Curry said. “We have a good amount 
of free time. There’s probably some 
time when we’re going to see San 
Diego. ”
“Flying in, [San Diego] looked 
beautiful, ” Cauley-Stein said. “It’s a 
different vibe — I like it. This campus 
is almost like paradise. ”Tritons Hope to Rebound against Tough CCAA Competitors

Barber had to sit out the game 
after earning successive yellow cards, 
netting the red card at the 39-minute 
mark. O’Laughlin met the same fate 
as she also netted two yellow cards in the second half, being sidelined 
with only three nail-biting minutes 
left in the game. Despite missing two 
positions, the Tritons persevered and 
came out victorious. Both Barber

Women’s Soccer Regains Footing
Over this past weekend, the UCSD women’s soccer team won two great games 
against visiting rivals Cal State East Bay on Friday and Cal State Stanislaus on 
Sunday, both wins claimed on home turf at Triton Soccer Stadium. With this 
victory, the Tritons advanced to a 6–3 overall ranking and an even 2–2 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association ranking. 
Game One
Friday night’s game was witnessed by a season-high 791 spectators as the Tritons took down 
the Cal State East Bay Pioneers 3–1, with all of the Tritons’ goals scored by underclassmen from 
San Diego County. The underclassmen who scored those three phenomenal goals are fresh -
men forwards Mary Reilly and Megumi Barber and sophomore forward Katie O’Laughlin. 
The match didn’t start out as hot for the Tritons as they had hoped — the Pioneers 
were able to take the lead at the 14th minute of the game. The Tritons were ready to fire 
back, however, and they did so six minutes later. Reilly scored off a beautifully-combined 
assist from sophomore defender Aimee Ellis and junior midfielder Jamie Benedett, to the 
cheers of hundreds of spectators. 
“Last weekend was tough, ” O’Laughlin told the UCSD Athletics Department. “We 
came back and got the three goals, and I think that proves that we had the spirit tonight. ” 
O’Laughlin, having just celebrated her 20th birthday on Thursday, came up on Friday 
night to score her first game-winning shot, scoring at the 54:29 mark. Reilly and co-
captain junior midfielder Kiera Bocchino were both credited with an assist for the goal. 
Barber scored the nail-in-the-coffin insurance goal, her second this year, in the 79th minute. 
Bocchino was again credited for the assist.
“We should’ve been two goals up, ” UCSD Head Coach Brian McManus told the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “We gave up a silly goal because of lack of communication, and 
suddenly we [found] ourselves [down 1–0], and the way it has been going on lately it 
would have been easy for the team to fold. ”
The Tritons dominated the Pioneers — they led in shots taken by a significant bulge: 
24–6, with 15–2 in just the first half. After this win, the Tritons now lead in the all-time 
series between the teams, 8–1. 
Game Two
Sunday’s game against Cal State Stanislaus was an even more impressive win for the 
Tritons, as they were critically short-handed, finishing the match with only nine players 
due to a pair of red-card ejections during the match. Despite this disadvantage, the Tritons 
held on tightly to their lead after O’Laughlin scored a goal at the 19th minute, ending the 
match 1–0.
After earning a free kick, Bocchino kicked the ball to the base of the far post, 
where O’Laughlin took the ball and scored on the opposite upper right corner. This is 
O’Laughlin’s team-leading fourth goal of the season and fourth consecutive goal over the 
past four games, all scored within the past 10 days. This is also her second consecutive 
game-winning goal, earning her the CCAA Women’s Soccer Player of the Week award. 
Bocchino also got her team-best third assist of the year. 
The Tritons’ goalie, senior Kelcie Brodsky, had an incredible game as she made six 
saves during the match, which helped her pick up her third individual clean sheet of the 
season and the 22nd of her career. 
“[In] the last seven minutes, there was no way we could go to overtime, ” junior defender 
Kirsten Sampietro said. “Kelcie made an amazing save in the last couple of minutes; we were 
really lucky to pull it out. We’re back in it. Today it was organized — we had a lot more Written by Gurkirat Singh // Senior Staff Writer

The Sacramento Kings are hold -
ing its NBA training camp at RIMAC 
Arena, the third team to do so in a 
span of 10 years, after the Phoenix 
Suns and the Los Angeles Clippers. 
The camp extends from Tuesday, 
Sept. 29 until Saturday, Oct. 3 and 
gives Head Coach George Karl the 
first chance to have his whole team 
at his disposition for their first full 
season together. On Tuesday, training camp opened its doors to media like 
ABC, FOX, Kings TV and the Sacra -
mento Bee. The UCSD Guardian also 
had the opportunity to be there.
Contrary to previous NBA training 
camps held at RIMAC Arena, the 
Kings’ training camp was open and 
inviting to the media. The first 20 
minutes of media accessibility were 
during the end of a scrimmage, giving 
the Guardian the opportunity to see

Tritons Suffer First Home Loss of  Season
UCSD snags win against Cal State East Bay but drops game against Stanislaus State.
This past weekend, UCSD men’s 
soccer team took on California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
foes Cal State East Bay and Cal State 
Stanislaus at Triton Soccer Stadium. 
The team snagged a 1–0 win in a highly 
defensive game against Cal State East 
Bay on Friday but failed to repeat 
that success on Sunday’s game 
against Cal State Stanislaus, the top 
team in the CCAA, ultimately falling 
in a disappointing 2–1 decision. The 
Tritons now sit at 3–3–3 overall and 
2–1–1 in the CCAA.
Game One
UCSD took an early lead against 
Cal State East Bay in the ninth 
minute of play in what turned out 
to be the only scoring sequence 
of the game. Sophomore forward 
Uly de la Cal began the play with 
a throw-in from the right sideline. 
Pioneer senior defender Duke 
Driggs attempted to clear the throw, 
but sophomore midfielder Zachary 
Lagotta regained possession with a 
quick touch and fired a left-footed 
shot into the net to push his team into the lead.
Despite a couple of chances for 
UCSD to increase its advantage, 
efforts to score fell just short of 
success. Freshman midfielder 
Brandon Monteiro Magpayo seized 
a chance to shoot on a wide-open 
net in the 49th minute but was shut 
down by a last-second block by the 
Pioneer defense. Within the next 
minute of play, UCSD attacked the 
net again. Junior midfielder Justice Duerksen hit a cross to Lagotta, 
who touched the ball across the 
penalty area to de la Cal. De la 
Cal then laid out and volleyed a 
spectacular right-footed shot that 
frustratingly ricocheted off the 
goalpost. Fortunately, the Tritons’ 
strong defensive efforts kept the 
Pioneers at bay, and UCSD secured 
a 1–0 victory.
