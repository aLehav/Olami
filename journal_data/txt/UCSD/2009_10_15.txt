A campus teach-in in Center Hall 
last night gave way to two hours of 
discussion on the university’s ongo-ing budget crisis. Students, faculty and staff decried systemwide bud-get cuts, student fee increases and employee furloughs.
Over 200 people 
attended the event, pack-ing the seats and aisles of Center 119.
“I didn’t come here 
with a speech in mind, but I felt kind of inspired by how many people were in the room, ” Thurgood Marshall College senior Coral Castillo said.
Communications  
professor Brian Goldfarb spoke first, presenting a slideshow that detailed his predictions for the budgetart effects on UCSD. 
Goldfarb said he 
expects to see a reduc-tion in library hours and resources, fewer days in the academic year, larger class sizes and waitlists, less course availabil-ity and decreased faculty interaction with students.
Goldfarb also warned that budget 
reductions will soon lead to a drop in the number of students admitted to the university. 
UCSD’s admission rate has 
decreased 10 percent from last year. Goldfarb said this will also mean an increase in out-of-state admissions — which means fewer California high-school seniors will be admitted to UCSD, along with other UCs and CSUs.   
“Basically, you’re going to be 
paying more for an education that is less than , ” Carolan Buckmaster, 
president of the Union of Professional and Technical Employees San Diego chapter said.
Sociology profes-
sor Isaac Martin said part of California’s budgetary problem lies in the state’s constitu-tion, which requires a two-thirds vote in each house to pass any tax increase.
“This means that 
if there is a hardcore majority of anti-tax peo-ple, they can block any tax increase they want, ” Martin said.
Martin added that 
California’s reluctance to tax real estate forces the state to draw rev-
enue from less reliable sources, like income tax — which fluctuates with the economy.
“Property-tax revenues cannot 
increase more than 2 percent per year, ” Martin said. “Compare that with the fact that student fees can increase 32 percent in over two years. ”)<+.,;*90:0:TRANSPORTATION DEPT. TO ASK STUDENTS FOR SHUTTLE FUNDS
By Yelena Akopian
News Editor
Major cutbacks could be dealth to the campus shuttle program if a 
$20 student fee referendum isn’t passed this year, claims UCSD’s Department of Parking and Transportation.
If approved by the A.S. Council 
and passed by students later this year, as is the hope of Director of Transportation Services Brian 
d’ Autremont, the ref-erendum would cre-ate a new parking and transportation fee of $20 per student per quarter. The fee would increase by $5 every 
year for the next five years, eventu-ally reaching $40 per student per quarter.According to d’ Autremont, the 
fee would generate $3,000,000 per year for the shuttle service by 2014.
D’ Autremont said funds for 
shuttles have been dwindling ever since the department began put-ting aside roughly $2 million per year seven years ago, in order to bring a deteriorating parking lot at Hillcrest Medical Center up to 
$0$500,000$1,000,000$1,500,000$2,000,000$2,500,000

The A.S. Council held its first press conference of the year on Oct. 12 in Price Center Plaza. Closely resembling a town-hall meeting, the event was intended 
to garner student input in a public setting. Though A.S. President Utsav Gupta — alongside Vice President of Finance and Resour ces Peter Beneshch, three 
campuswide senators and a handful of college-council representatives — attempted to field questions from students, audience participation was minimal. VP External Affairs Gracelynn West and VP Student Life Ricsie Hernandez did not attend.

building code by 2019. 
Without additional funding, 
d’ Autremont said he would have cut 
shuttle services by about half — eliminating MTS bus routes 3,10, 150 and 921 and reducing the fre-quency of the Nobel, Arriba, Mesa and Hillcrest shuttle routes — in order to continue directing parking revenue toward the new structure.
These cuts would save $1,238,523 
annually and reduce ridership by approximately 730,000 passengers. 
“ At this point, that’s as far as I’m 
willing to look, ” he said.
Currently, shuttle services are 
funded by revenue from parking permits and citations. Last year, cita-tions generated about $2 million for the department, while permit sales brought in about $5 million.
However, the department’s public-
transportation costs have significantly expanded since 2005, while parking revenue has stayed about the same. Funds from the referendum would bring the department’s overall annu-al budget to over $24 million by its fourth year. 
D’ Autremont said an alternative option would be to charge students on a pay-per-ride basis. He said he is hesitant to consider such a move, as it may discour-age students from taking the shuttles at all — rais-ing the number of cars on campus back up to their previous rates.
Assistant Director 
of Parking and Transportation Sam Corbett said that stu-dents at UC Berkeley, UC Merced, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara and UC Santa Cruz pay a fee for their campus shuttle services, similar to the one d’ Autremont has pro-posed — ranging from $13.13 per quarter at Santa Barbara to $110.66 per quarter at Santa Cruz. 
D’ Autremont said the referen-
dum would give students an oppor-tunity to participate in transporta-tion decisions by appointing stu-dents to a board, which would then coordinate in some yet to be deter-mined way with the Transportation Policy Committee. 
He said members of A.S. Council 
on the board would have control 
over the shuttle system, and be able to decide which shuttle routes to add, eliminate or change, within the given budget. 
“ I ’ m  k i n d  o f  a n  i d e a l -
ist, ” he said. “I don’t worry about it at all because I’ve had very good experienc-es [with student input]. ”
D’ Autremont said the 
details of the referendum as students will see it before next year will be left up to the A.S. Council. 
A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta said the language of the referendum is still in its early stages, and that 
he is concerned the student board might not have enough oversight.
“If the referendum is providing 
only 20 percent of the overall bud-get, is the board also responsible for the other 80 percent coming from Parking and Transportation?” he said. “They might not have that juris-diction because they only represent a 
fraction [of the budget]. ”
Gupta said he is reluctant to sup-
port a referendum if it means rev-enue from permit sales currently feeding the shuttle service are redi-rected toward other university capi-tal projects. 
“I would support a referendum 
that responsibly maintains or expands the service of our shuttle, ” Gupta said. “If students put more money toward transportation, they should see some increase in services. ”
However, a statement provided 
by the department said that if the fee referendum passes, parking-permit revenue will in fact begin to go toward future capital projects such as replacing an aging shuttle fleet and a new East Campus park-ing structure at La Jolla Medical Center
“We’re generating a long-term 
agreement for something that is just for a parking structure, so we need to be careful, ” Gupta said. “When the parking structure is out of the picture, what happens to the money then?”

Buckmaster lectured on the effect 
of the cuts on staff in particular, 
claiming that the decisions made by the UC Board of Regents undermine union power. 
“We can do all these teach-ins as 
we want to, ” Buckmaster said. “We need a step three and we need to make it a loud one. ” 
Literature professor Dennis 
Childs said the budget cuts may ulti-mately lead to less diversity among students.  He also said the university is slowly losing faculty members to furloughs and salary cuts.
“Hopefully, I won’t have to go 
elsewhere to get an adequate pay-check for me and my family, ” he said.
Three fourth-year students from 
the Saving UCSD Coalition also addressed the audience.  Revelle College senior Sam Jung said the American dream has become almost impossible to achieve.  Jung said the cuts have widespread impacts and are affecting all college students – not just those at UCSD.
Castillo discussed her difficult 
financial situation. As a freshman, Castillo’s Cal Grant of $7,000 covered her $6,000 tuition. However, Castillo said that, as a result of budget cuts, her grant was cut, and will leave her an estimated $30,000 in debt by the time she graduates in June.  
“College is no longer affordable, ” 
Castillo said.

CHALLENGECHANCELLOR’SOn today’s agenda: budgets 
(read: long, number-heavy meeting until the wee hours 
of the morning). 
Armed with this knowledge, A.S. 
councilmembers took their time to arrive, trickling slowly into the third meeting of 2009-10. 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue was first to address the council, informing councilmembers about a number of topics including stu-dent fee increases and UCSD’s 50th anniversary celebra-tion. 
Rue told coun-
cilmembers to “keep their eyes on the prize, ” reminding them to focus on the bigger goals that need to be accomplished throughout the year. 
“Not everyone wants to be in 
representative government…I think of you guys as my colleagues, ” Rue said. “There’s nothing that Student 
Affairs wants that can be achieved without student leaders. ” 
VP Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch introduced University Events Office Business 
Manager Kristen Fernandez, who tried to explain the complexities of the A.S. budget. 
“There’s been confusion about 
how our money is handled, and we’re getting lost in the order of debate, ” Benesch said. 
Fernandez cleared up much con-
fusion about Mandate Reserves and where A.S. revenue comes from. 
Following the presentation, 
Speaker James Lintern reminded councilmembers to be respectful and refrain from texting or surfing the Internet during the meeting. 
President Utsav Gupta rounded 
out the special presentations by explaining the 2009-2010 executive budget, which included stipends for members of his office staff — a few of whom came in and introduced them-selves to the council.  
And then, the moment everyone 
had been waiting for: the budget! 
Councilmembers dissected spe-
cific wording and allocation amounts for vari-ous organizations and events within the budget. The six Bear Gardens held each aca-demic year 
warranted one of the night’s longer discussions.
“Do we really need an event where 
alcoholic beverages are served that you can enjoy on your own?” Arts and Humanities Senator Omar Khan said. 
Benesch said the Bear Gardens 
are a way to reach out to junior and senior students, who normally don’t see a reason to return to Student Life. 
“Beer brings them back in good 
numbers, ” Benesch said. 
AVP Diversity Affairs Jasmine 
Phillips asked for more than the $1,000 A.S. had allocated for diversity programming. 
“$1,000 shows that A.S. doesn’t 
care, ” Phillips said. 
The Council then voted to increase 
the amount of funds allocated to diversity programming to $5,000.
Next, debate ignited over whether 
or not to provide $4,000 in additional funds to Triton Tide for fireworks on Spirit Night, or if the funds should come from the $20,000 already allo-cated to the spirit group.
Gupta was determined to keep the 
funding separate.);;Q\[,W_VNWZ5IZI\PWV*]LOM\

A bill ensuring continued health-
care coverage for students who take 
leaves of absence for medical rea-sons went into effect last week, one year after President George W . Bush signed it into law.
HR 2851 — also known as 
Michelle’s law — allows students to take up to one year of leave from col-lege, while retaining coverage under their parents’ health insurance. 
The bill was named after Michelle 
Morse, a former student at Plymouth University in New Hampshire. In 2004, Morse was diagnosed with colon cancer and was advised by doctors to stay home and rest while undergoing chemotherapy. Morse’s insurer informed her that she would no longer be eligable for coverage if she failed to remain a full-time student. However, when she took a leave of absence from school to focus on the treatment, Morse could no longer be covered by her parents’ health insurance.
Morse underwent 
chemotherapy while tak-ing a full load of classes, eventually graduating with honors. She passed away six months later.
“ As policies renew, Michelle’s Law 
now takes place, ” her mother Anne Marie Morse said. “It’s a preemp-tive law — all states must adopt the 
law as a minimum. Some states, such as New Mexico and New Hampshire, expanded that. ”
State Senator George 
Runner authored California’s version of the law, which applies to graduate students as well as undergraduates. 
“[Sen. Runner] took 
an interest in it to pre-vent an unfair situation regarding insurance coverage, ” Runner’s Communications  Director Jana Saastad said. “He wanted to help students contin-
ue recieving insurance while going through catastrophic medical situ-ations.
By staying in school, Morse and 
other students in similar situations lack the time necessary to focus on vital treatment and recovery.
“It’s a Catch-22, ” UCSD Insurance 
Coordinator Jessica Morris said. “Y ou’re too sick to come to school, but you have to be a full-time student to stay on your parent’s insurance. ”
After Morse’s death, her mother 
began a letter-writing campaign in an effort to change the law.
“I called the insurance company, 
spoke to an employee and found out the information was correct, ” Anne Marie Morse said. “The employee said to me, ‘Okay, Mrs. Morse, you can change the law, and that’ll take a long time. ’ I said, ‘Okay, I have the time. ’ And I got started. ”
Anne Marie Morse wrote to sev-
eral of New Hamshire’s political offi-cials, including the former governor, 
members of the state’s legislature and presidential candidates. Eventually, members of the state legislature reached out to Anne Marie Morse, agreeing that the current policy was unfair.
The bill was passed by the New 
Hampshire Legislature, and was signed into law in June 2006. 
While working toward a New 
Hampshire law, Anne Marie Morse discovered that Michelle’s Law also fell under federal jurisdiction, which began the push for a national version.
“I ended up going down to 
Washington, DC, ” Anne Marie Morse said. “I had face-to-face meetings with my Washington del-egation. When I left that evening, I knew I had full support, and that they would help sponsor a bill. ”

Only nine months into his 
term, President Barack Obama was handed the 
most prestigious award for peace in the world — and he hasn’t done a damn thing to deserve it.
Since its inception over 100 years 
ago, the Nobel Peace Prize has been the highest form of international peace props you can score. Greats like Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela are among a few of the prize’s past recip-ients — people who lived for their respective causes and took radical action for a better future. 
Not to get nitpicky, but Alfred 
Nobel’s will says the peace prize should go “to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses. ”
Simply put, the awardee usually 
can’t be, say, leading two wars and serving as overseer of Torture Island. 
Apparently, the Norwegian Nobel 
Committee was able to overlook such details and focus on the presi-dent’s efforts to improve relations between the U.S. and the Middle East and decrease the world’s nuclear missile stockpile. 
True, Obama has advocated that 
world leaders agree to collectively eliminate over 200 of the 1,700 nukes currently in existence. Of course, it’s a step in the right direction, but might not be the most concrete accomplishment. I’m pretty sure Jong and Medvedev didn’t trash their nukes the moment he said that.
A much more important factor 
of peace is the whole not-fighting-and-killing thing. In this category, Obama sacked a Nobel Peace Prize as reasonably as Rush Limbaugh might earn a lifetime achievement award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
First, let’s consider our war in 
Afghanistan. Since Obama took office, 21,000 more soldiers have been deployed to posts around the war-battered country. His top mili-tary advisors have recommended sending an additional 40,000 troops in the near future, and the president has consistently referred to Afghanistan as the “just” war, signal-ing no end to the bloodshed. 
Taliban or not, the war in 
Afghanistan is still a war, and more than enough citizens have paid the price on both sides. 
Old Nobel would be stirring in 
his grave if he knew that the most recent recipient of his esteemed award had actually increased the standing armies abroad. 
Nobel also probably wouldn’t 
have appreciated a little place called Guantanamo Bay. One of Obama’s first initiatives as president was to close the island prison on the island of Cuba that currently houses some 250 suspected terrorists. During a Bush administration that saw the bastardization of American values under the Patriot Act, Guantanamo 
See SEASONED page 5Apparently, the campus shuttle service is out of money. Bus lines will be eliminated. 
Ridership will plummet. Everyone will start driving to campus. Parking will be a nightmare. Carbon emissions will skyrocket. The environment is doomed. Everything is ruined.
Time to panic? Kind of. Though 
our shuttles — like every public com-modity in this near-failed state — may soon bow to the budget crisis, the department of transportation services has a novel idea: Raise student fees.
The department hopes to pass a 
$20 quarterly fee referendum by the end of this year — one sponsored by our own student government. 
If passed, the new fee would con-
tribute $1.5 million to the bus and shuttle services in its first year. From there, the fee would increase by $5 every year for the next four years, eventually rising to $40. 
But don’t bust out your picket sign 
of the month just yet: The referendum would also give the A.S. Council the option to create a board to control the shuttle routes — a board comprised mostly of students. 
A student-run, 
student-funded shuttle service tailored to stu-dent needs. 
Let’s not get lost in 
the shiny appeal of our very own bus line just yet, though. When the 
university creates boards like the one proposed, it also ensures that students could never sway a major decision. More than anything, this is a great opportunity for the administration to tax the student body, save its broken assets and package it all under the guise of student empowerment. 
Take the Athletic, Recreation and 
Sports Facility Board, for example. Created in 2004 to oversee campus recreational spending, the board does virtually nothing. To this day, student organizations are charged an addi-tional fee to host events at RIMAC. The A.S. Council even set up its own committee to investigate this ques-tionable double-charging scheme. Y ou can see how well that went.
Even if shuttle control is indeed 
ceded to students, this transfer of power could have negative results. The A.S. Council has never demonstrated itself to be a particularly effective deci-sionmaking body — why leave them in charge of something as important as getting to and from campus? 
For students to wield this type of 
responsibility, certain conditions must be met. Any alterations to the service should be made only after consult-ing transportation experts — and all major decisions should be made only after surveying the student body. 
Additionally, those students serv-
ing on the board should have to be elected through a campuswide vote. Student appointees — like the ones currently serving on every major (and mostly ineffective) campus committee — tend to be apathetic. Prospective members should have to work for a place on this new board, and their selection shouldn’t be marred by internal council politics. 
And, as long as we’re making a 
wish list, let’s be sure to eliminate the automatic $5-per-year fee increase. It’s not fair to levy a tax on future stu-dents — let them vote on another fee increase four years from now.
“It’s your referendum, ” Director 
of Parking and Transportation Brian d’ Autremont said to the Guardian  edi-
torial board. “Not ours. ”
But it is theirs, and students need 
to keep that in mind. This referendum is designed to save a failing campus service, one already heavily bankrolled by students through parking-permit revenue. It’ s OK to be outraged.
Ultimately, however, the shuttles 
need to stay. They provide transporta-tion for thousands of students every day, and, when you factor in the envi-ronmental benefits, paying a $20 fee is kind of like doing your civic duty.
Let’ s just make sure we take our 
time with this one.

Spring Quarter was host to a rowdy campaign season for 2009-10 A.S. Council hope-
fuls, the majority of whom were especially enthusiastic about council visibility. Putting preach to practice this Monday, elected councilmembers — or, about 10 of the 50-odd students currently serving on the council — held the year’s first official “press conference” on their trusty ol’ black platform in Price Center Plaza.
A.S. President Utsav Gupta gave 
a short rundown of student-govern-ment goings-on to an unenthusiastic scattering of food-court patrons. He was followed by the always-charming VP Finance and Resources Peter Benesch, who delivered an uplifting speech about supporting the Grove Cafe, a longtime A.S. enterprise in the Student Center that the council plans to revamp this year. 
That’s when things got kind of 
awkward.
“We also have two other vice 
presidents who couldn’t make it here today, ” Gupta said.
He later attributed the absence of 
VP External Affairs Gracelynn West and VP Student Life Ricsie Hernandez to conflicts in their class schedules, 
though it seemed elemental that the 
press conference be adjusted accord-ing to the availability of two of four top cabinet members. It’s equally amusing that conference planners had the time to print out nifty little event-specific “Press Access” laminates to adorn their A.S. lanyards, but couldn’t drag along all the councilmembers 
needed to answer department-specific 
questions from students.
Not that there was much crowd participation, beyond a faceless “I want my money back!” and a coun-cilmember’s threat that Gupta would be held accountable for his “bullshit” plans for a football referendum. 
Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy and the two Warren College senators did make a noble 
attempt at catching side-glances from 
disinterested students via the shouting approach — though a sense of desper-ation couldn’t help but ring through all councilmembers’ voices by the end of the one-sided “conference. ”
In the end, we agree it’s ridiculous 
that A.S. councilmembers would have to bend so far backward to get 
students to care about the almost $150 
they pay to the council’s annual bud-get. Especially considering that the fee almost doubled last year. Ideally, we would all get off our asses and trek to the fourth floor of Price Center East every Wednesday evening to have our say. But we have to remember that most UCSD students didn’t even vote — neither for their representatives nor their puffed-up concerts-and-events contribution. But it’s still their money, 
and it’s one of the councilmembers’ 
most elemental jobs to force an alien-ated student body to care. 
First, that means showing up like 
they care themselves. Where are those game faces we saw plastered all over campus during election season? Gupta can’t run a one-man show here. We recognize that there have been other individual A.S. efforts this year: West 
rallied student support for the walk-out, and Hernandez has been hard at work on the First Fall program.
But no A.S. initiative will ever 
gain the student momentum it needs 
without some illusion of unity at the top. Visibility isn’t preferable if you’re visibly falling apart. It’s great to see Gupta and Benesch are getting along so well, but the absence of their other half, along with a giant chunk of the council’s voting body, paints an initial 
image for students of their council as 
a piecey, disunified clique. And really, guys — we’ d love to be proven wrong.
The press conference was a start. 
But visibility events must far exceed the originally projected one per quar-ter and target alternative locations like the Student Center. Three quarters go by a lot faster than you think.

Bay became its paragon. Shutting 
down the prison would have been a fantastic start for Obama’s pro-jected plan of change. But after encountering a strong opposition in Congress, where it faced a 90-6 vote, Obama shelved his plan to close Guantanamo. 
I understand the bureaucratic 
nightmare that would have awaited Obama had he tried to overcome a 90-6 vote, but the fact that he imme-diately gave up and hasn’t mentioned it since makes me question how sincere he was about ever actually closing the prison in the first place. Perhaps it was simply a way to mar-ket himself.
While previous 
Nobel Prize winners were awarded for persistence in the face of serious adversity, Obama was given the same award after losing a staring contest with House Republicans.
Granted, I do believe that Obama 
has done a great deal to improve the U.S. ’s global image after eight hor-rendous years of President George W . Bush’s administration. I was lucky enough to be in Egypt after he spoke there last spring, where locals were thrilled to talk to me about our new president. 
Obama’s successful public rela-
tions shouldn’t go unnoticed, but they hardly warrant a Nobel Peace Prize.
The Norwegian Nobel 
Committee’s commissioner, Thorbjoern Jagland, said last week that Obama’s actions to date “have contributed to — I wouldn’t say a safer world — but a world with less tension. ” If the qualifications for a Nobel Peace Prize now include simply decreasing tension, we could have saved a lot of trouble by just treating all the world’s leaders to a day at a shi-atsu massage parlor. 
For eight years under Bush we 
were frustrated, depressed and bit-ter. Obama came along and offered a large body of people some hope. They latched on to Obama’s “change” wagon and rediscovered feelings of national pride that had disappeared long ago. 
There were a few of us out there 
who were critical of Obama’s actual pro-gram from the start, but the majority saw him as the savior of American politics, both here and abroad.
The simple truth 
is that Obama isn’t a savior. He won’t fix all our problems, and of course no single per-son ever can — but chances are, he won’t 
even come close.
I hope Obama will do great 
things one day, but for now, he’s drifting on a worldwide public-rela-tions campaign and a never-ending bouquet of flowery speeches.
After winning the award, Obama 
said he was “surprised and deeply humbled” — and I believe him. Even Obama himself doesn’t think he deserves the award. Y et here he is, one Nobel Peace Prize richer.
Not every prizewinner has suc-
ceeded on the MLK/Mother Teresa level, so I’m not saying that Obama has that requisite. 
But after nine months of unful-
filled promises, endless warring and an open torture center, can we really hail the president as any sort of peacekeeper?

Dear Editor,
This morning, KUSI-TV ran a 
story on the unveiling of a “Latino”  
mural on campus. 
But what was really unveiled 
was the far, far left agenda of the 
university, by pandering to the anti-American Hispanics  and permitting 
them to display clearly religious and political statements. 
Including “health care for all” is 
a divisive statement and is strictly political in nature. 
In an environment where self-reliance and upward mobility should be taught, this only serves to further the parasitical entitlement mentality of low expectations resulting from low self-esteem  and “victimization. ”  
Imagine the outcry if openly 
Christian symbols with “enforce border security” or “no amnesty”  
were brazenly depicted by faith-based  American patriots. But no 
such outrage when enemies such as anti-American, murdering terrorists like “Che”  Guevara are exalted. 
UCSD’s clear endorsement of 
anti-white, anti-straight, anti-faith, anti-American sentiments in the name of  “diversity”  is just another 
example of the socialist liberals undermining our great, traditional American culture.

On Oct. 10, Turkey and Armenia signed a historic peace treaty to restore diplomacy and re-open their long-sealed border. Given that the two countries have endured nearly a century of 
discontent following the Armenian genocide, many remain skeptical as to whether the treaty is anything more than a superficial display of good will, accompanied by a faux-friendly hand-
shake between the nation’s leaders. But what does the treaty really signify? 
 www.CaliforniaWestern.edu What is the law?
        A  w e a p o n  t o  b e  w i e l d e d ?
 Or more than that?
        A  s e t  o f  t o o l s .
           A  c r e a t i v e  a p p r o a c h .    A helping profession and collaborative process.
 Explore the wide scope of the law
              in a school devoted to the big picture.It’s obvious that the recent peace 
treaty upon which Turkey and 
Armenia have agreed isn’t the stron-gest signifier of peace between the nations’ citizens. Regardless, overarch-ing statements from world leaders do make a difference over time.
As powerful players in history, 
Turkish President Abdullah Gül and Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan recognized that — given the 1915 Armenian genocide at the hands of the Turks — one that the nation still refuses to acknowledge — bad blood still runs pretty deep here. 
While clearly, a single well-pub-
licized treaty can’t instantly reverse 96 years of ill will, hostility does fade with time. 
A sincere and convicted declara-
tion by a national leader can also seep into his people’s consciousness over an extended period of time. The Truman Doctrine of 1947, for instance — which stressed the need to spread democracy by preventing communism from taking root in Turkey and Greece — set the tone for decades of inter-ventionist foreign policy in America. 
In this case a tone of peacefulness 
is still far from being fully established, but signing a peace treaty is a posi-tive first step on the road to recon-ciliation. For genuine good will to be established between two long-hostile nations, a pre-emptive gesture may need to be the starting point.
— Jordan Wada
Contributing WriterDespite their governments’ best intentions, nearly a century 
of animosity between Turkey and Armenia cannot be instantly brushed aside by two signatures on a treaty.
When the two countries’ lead-
ers met last Saturday, they both chose to ignore the giant elephant in the room: Turkey still vehemently refuses to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide of 1915 to 1923. When the U.S. Senate proposed to recognize the genocide in 1989, Turkey responded by blocking American ships in the Mediterranean and suspending U.S. military training facilities in Turkish territory.
Tensions between the two coun-
tries have continued for years in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a conflict area between Armenia and its Turkish ally Azerbaijan, which has kept Turkey and Armenia at each others’ throats. Even though an official ceasefire has been in place for years, fighting in the region unsur-prisingly continues to this day. 
In the end, no official document 
or room of cordial officals can hope to eliminate longstanding disagree-ments at ground level.
Ironically, both parties delayed 
the treaty’s signing in an attempt to censor the other’s statements. The Oct. 10 ceremony was delayed three hours as both leaders pouted in their respective corners of rhetoric — until Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton cajoled the two to make nice and sign the document. Meaning, in case we didn’t know, it was nothing more than a public relations stunt at the end of the day.
 Former Armenian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Vardan Oskanyan said it himself: “Signing these docu-ments will not solve our problems. On the contrary, they will bring on entirely new setbacks and problems that can only be tackled by a unified, free, hopeful society. ”
Without the backing of their 
respective populations, this treaty will only increase internal and external tension. Armenians fear the condi-tions of the protocols will be entirely on Turkey’s terms. Reuters reports that, immediately following the cer-emony, Turkey called on Armenia to withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh — a move that Armenian leaders are still contemplating.
Tensions between Armenia and 
Turkey have clearly not dissipated with the wave of a magic pen — both nations have a deep-seated history of conflict, and their friction will not disappear with empty words of acceptance. It’s about time world leaders dropped their flashy press-conference acts and start talking the issue out from the bottom up.
— Arik Burakovsky
Contributing WriterTurkey and Armenia’s super-ficial peace pact, in the end, 
amounts to little more than a stra-tegic Turkish move for admission into the European Union. 
Turkey has been clamoring to 
join the EU since 1987, though its patchy human rights record — including heavy censorship, sketchy relations with Cyprus and poor treatment of Armenia — have sig-nificantly delayed its acceptance.
Although the treaty is a nomi-
nal declaration that does not guar-antee progress between Armenia and Turkey, signing it could easily bring the latter that much closer to overcoming EU objections. No matter how much support may be lacking within the Armenian and Turkish populations, on an international level, this is a defini-tive step toward Turkey’s ability to redress its image as an aggressor, and may indeed bring it one step closer to that golden EU member-ship it so desperately craves.
Armenia’s potential gains aren’t 
so concrete. A treaty may have its economic benefits in time, but for the most part, it’s Turkey — who has been arguing its status as a developed country and EU asset for over 20 years — that stands to gain more from the pact. If this accord proves fruitful and leads to Turkish-Armenian alliance (which will almost certainly first require a recognition of the Armenian geno-cide), the subsequent stabilization of the region will only strengthen Turkey’s long-denied bid for admission.

FRIDAY, OCT. 16 7 P .M. TUESDAY, OCT. 20 8:55 P .M.
At 40, the newly divorced Jimmy (“Letters from Iwo Jima”) is moving from Japan to America to restart his life with the help of his sister, Aiko; her displeased 
husband, Tak; and their 10-year-old, 
Bob, who, as his name suggests, is 
wise far beyond his years. While 
Jimmy’s “rebirth” requires him 
to share a bunk bed with 
Bob, he is strangely optimis-

as he is — about as suave 
as a Steve Carell typecast — 
Jimmy botches his chances 
with a number of women 
before meeting his unfortunate 
match: Tak’s niece Ramona (“Saving 
Face”). Of course, hilarity ensues.
“CHILDREN OF INVENTION”
THURSDAY, OCT. 15 7 P .M. (FREE RECEPTION AT 5:30)
In this American dream-shattering exploration of the immigrant experience by freshman director Tze Chun, single mother Cindy (Elaine Cheung) 
struggles to support her two children (Michael Chen, Crystal Chiu) when the trio is evicted and seeks refuge in an unfur-nished apartment. After moving in and out of sales jobs, Cindy’s desperation leads her into a Ponzi scheme designed to vic-timize unknowing immi-grants. When the scheme collapses, she is separated from her children, who must survive on their own. Confronting hot topics like economic meltdown and the exploitation of immigrants, this one’s a groundbreaker all around.
“RED CLIFF”
SUNDAY, OCT. 18 7 P .M. TUESDAY, OCT. 20 8:55 P .M.
Action director John Woo defined ’80s Hong Kong cine-ma with classics like “The Killer, “Hard Boiled” and “ A Better Tomorrow. ” In the ’90s, he created Hollywood 
blockbusters “Face/Off ” and “Mission Impossible II. ” Today, Woo returns to his roots with the most expensive film in the history of Asian cinema : an epic account of the Battle 
of Red Cliff, where a force of 50,000 men defeated an army of nearly one million in the final days of the Han Dynasty. With an all-star cast including Tony Leung (“Infernal Affairs”), Takeshi Kaneshiro, Wei Zhao (“So Close”) and Fengyi Zhang, “Red Cliff ” is old-fashioned mythic fun from one of Asian cinema’s living legends.

So I used to be relatively cool. No, for real though. For instance, I used to like like the Stooges. I also 
liked putting weird shit in my hair. I knew someone who knew Tom Waits. I elbowed a hot path to the front row, put my hands in the air when the 
emcee told me so, stuffed my pockets 
with expensive cheeses and didn’t even think to gargle when my throat hurt. 
What’s more, I nourished  the 
croak — running to meet whichever icy ocean break was nearest, double-doggy daring my own naked saltwa-ter death to overtake me then, there, in one gallant fit of afterparty.
OK, so I was also retarded.  But in 
the coolest way possible — promise.
Alas, that was then. At some indis-
tinguishable point between small-town high school and the grand poetic flop that is the UCSD writing circle, I self-mutilated into a ruffled, domestic little nester with an eye for snuggly stuffed monkeys, shiny-pretty things and cer-tainly no more patience for Unfinished

Step into the normally orderly Atkinson Hall in Earl Warren 
College and your ears are met with muffled sonic chaos, emanating from Calit2’s Gallery Interior. 
Computer music 
graduate student José Ignacio López Ramírez-Gastón is the guilty party, with his peace-disturbing installation “24 Speakers and 24 Sound Sources. ”  Standing 
outside the double doors, the artist smiled. 
“They usually keep 
these doors open, ” López said.  “But because of the 
sound, they had to close them. ” 
And that’s precisely 
the point of “24 Speakers. ”  
Through interactive audio and visuals, López’ art draws attention to the stark cultural contrast between geographically adjacent cities Tijuana and San Diego. The artist strives to force a little dis-order from south of the border onto UCSD’s ultra clean campus.
“Tijuana and San 
Diego depend on each other, and the contrast 
Seemingly inspired by Brooklyn artist Tara Donovan’s sub-lime “Untitled” sculpture — a piece crafted from hundreds of Styrofoam  cups and glue — the exterior of “Media Womb” is 
deceivingly simple. Sitting smack dab in the middle of Atkinson Hall’s main walkway, the layered structure is made from more or less unso-phisticated materials: Hundreds of cardboard egg cartons are stacked  
to form a rectangular womb large enough for four people to sit in
Clear plastic tubes equipped with motion sensors dangle from 
the womb’s ceiling, forming win d-chimey patterns. The slightest

Though what is generally referred to as the “Chicano history mural” — commissioned to be painted by Mario Torero — has been hanging in Thurgood Marshall College for some 
weeks now, a crowd of students, faculty and staff gathered out back Peterson Hall on Wednesday afternoon to watch a series of speakers — including Marye Anne Fox and a female student who had just jotted down a poem in the library — dedicate the artwork, and all its connotations, to each other and their “community.” The piece is actually an enlarged digital snapshot of a smaller painting, of about eight feet wide. A tad fragmented and unideally not painted by students, sure, but it’s about time we colored up this campus a little bit. Petitions are currently floating around to protest the projected removal of the mural on Dec. 12 — you’d be best off checking the Cross-Cultural center.

HIATUS PICKS THE WEEK’S BEST BETS
Easily compared to the Voltron-esque Traveling Willburys 
— which included George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty — this generation’s jangly supergroup pulls all sorts of all-stars from the indie-folk pool. We get two parts Bright Eyes (Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis), one part My Morning Jacket (Jim James) and one part fellow Thousand Oaks High School graduate M. Ward. Adding up to a jammy mish-mash of driving anthems, acoustic asides and country-fried harmonies that should translate epically onstage to a playful diversion from the members’ main work. They might not be Ringo’s All Starr Band, but they’re worth a pricey ticket. (CK)MONSTERS OF FOLK

Technicolor Navajo Passes His Peace
Pipe, Packed With Teen Nostalgia
After 34 studio albums, count-
less live recordings and a nev-er-ending tour, the legendary 
Bob Dylan treks into extremely charted territory with the unpre-dictable career move Christmas In the Heart  — 15 gravelly renditions 
of traditional carols.
Has Mr. Tambourine Man 
regressed into Santa’s Little Helper? Y es, in a way, as all royalties go straight to Feeding America, a hunger-relief charity. Dylan also partnered with Citibank to make the album available a week earlier to those enrolled in the bank’s reward program. 
This from the same Dylan 
who, over 40 years ago, sat alone on stage, guitar in hand, weaving incendery melodies of protest and contempt? The former voice of a generation has once again demonstrated his willingness to sell out, this time by singing “Have Y ourself a Merry Little Christmas. ” Oh, the shame.
The times may be a-changin’ , 
but at least this gimmicky set showcases Dylan’s classic old croak, even if the raspy and hard-ened 68-year-old pipes at times seems to channel a drunken pedo-phile.
Dylan covers all the traditional 
holiday hymns — from “Little Drummer Boy, ” to “First Noel, ” to any other tune that happens to include a manger or wise man. On “Must Be Santa, ” a freakishly upbeat accordian proves Santa officially zonked on uppers, while Dylan’s voice fails to wheeze out the remainder of the tune. The unbearable cheese of the album’s backup choir harkens a pre-rock, pre-Dylan time period, rendering this mantelpiece nothing more than an old-timey novelty with none of Bob’s historic bite.
Dylan now proudly joins 
the long list of artists — N’Sync, Christina Aguilera and the Beach Boys included — who have churned out their own versions of every beaten-to-death jolly jam on the pageant setlist. Screw being in the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame or one of the century’s most influen-tial people — Dylan is warming hearts this holiday season.

If an ’80s pop song was fur-
ther simplified into the blippy soundtrack to your favorite 
childhood Nintendo game, that twisted candyland would sound a lot like Neon Indian.
Their new LP , Psychic Chasms,  
is a shimmery fuse of pulsing elec-tro-beats and breathy melodies, spliced with choppy laser-gun sound effects and thrown together in a drug-dusted haze after a string of failed relationships.   
The latest project from Alan 
Palomo (also of VEGA), Indian is a collaboration with video artist Alicia Scardetta, who contrib-utes multimedia complements to Palomo’s jams. Initially hyped as a mysterious duo, the pair’s first three singles created a frenzy on the blogosphere — and like so, Indian’s legendary status was birthed. When Palomo finally revealed his secret identity, both VEGA and Indian had made headlines and garnered their fair share of Internet props. 
The album’s dazed, summery 
sound is easy on the ears, some-thing akin to a sun-warped MGMT album playing on your parents’ ancient RPM-mangling record player. Pop in your headphones, and you risk daydreaming you’re a Y ogi dropping acid while screwing around on the turntables.
Squiggly pads and reverberat-
ing chants swamp a song like “Terminally Chill” to a hyper-retro degree, and while cheesy keys and stock Casio beats are all the rage right now, Palomo ultimately gets away with it — so well-crafted is his songwriting.
Indian’s lyrics are laced with 
hard-to-swallow regret, capturing the tailspins our minds can whirl into over missed chances, though they sometimes deteriorate into a series of sighs and unintelligible murmurs. “Should Have Taken Acid With Y ou” sums up the wistful teenage vibe that Palomo attempts to conjur, and with lines like “Touch the stars and the plan-ets too” and “Take our clothes off in the swimming pool, ” we yearn for the carefree. Be sure to throw Chasms on at your Monday night kickback or the neighbor’s next backyard skinny dip.

with an immediate aural 
response. One side of the womb produces environmen-tal static recorded in Tijuana, while the other end answers simple motion with harsh gunshots lifted straight from popular media reports of vio-lence at the border. 
After a few minutes of 
experimentation, you begin to learn a sense of the womb’s sonic patterns, and how to manipulate your move-ments in order to change volume, pitch and speed. 
“Media Womb, ” a collaboration between Giacoma Castagnola, Camilo 
Ontiveros, Nina Waisman and Felipe Zuniga — three of whom studied visual art at UCSD — imposes on us a sense of hope. Upon understanding the space, its noise is no longer dictated by the programmed womb, which represents popular media. Rather, the decision-making power is shifted onto ourselves as individu-als: We can now control this environment in sonic expression.between them enriches our lives in 
so many ways, ” López said. “There is much we can learn from accepting the power of our multicultural environ-ment. ”
Open the doors holding the 
Tijuana native’s work, and the full acoustic effect hits a gust of sonic wind. Streaming through an eclectic collection of audio sources — includ-ing tape recorders and used speakers as large as small children — are two TJ radio stations and a CD containing horn-heavy Latin  music straight from 
a Tijuana street market.
Spanning three walls, the speak-
ers and other noisemakers are evenly spaced in a semicircle, crudely con-nected with wires and cables that pile in a jumbled mess upon a small table — eventually leading to a stereo receiver with its circuit board exposed. Two old-school television sets play a staticky  live feed of Tijuana TV .
The setup is so low-tech, López 
said, that the audience is invited to mess with faders and see what hap-pens — ensuring no two people will ever experience the piece in the same way. By choosing  not to use hi-tech commodities like computer program-ming, López questions the convention-al approach to sonic installations.
“Is sound experimentation depen-
dent on access to expensive technol-ogy?” he asked. “I am trying to rep-resent a sound space that is based in the cultural strategies of informal and marginalized communities — com-munities that in this case are right next door. ”

Here at the frontier, Mexico offers itself for sale to the world. Come one and all,  
and invest in our cheap labor!” 
This sarcastic yet heavy exclamation provides the opening text for the 
15th piece in visual-arts professor Fred Lonidier’s 35-year documentary photo/
text installation, which details the corrupt labor movement at the border.
Spanning over 10 feet, east to west, on Calit2’s display wall, “Rio Tijuana 
Bridge: A Tale of Two Globes or Two Tales of a Globe” consists of two laminated sheets of paper covered in excerpts from articles and photographs, bordered by colorful flags from across the world.
Through the installation, Lonidier presents a lesson on globalization that reads 
like a chapter from a textbook the government would love to censor: Instead of a champion for democracy, the U.S. is portrayed as a destructive force, ruthlessly wiping out all traces of cultural identity. 
“My work is pedagogical in intent to inform those who do not know about a 
particular struggle or class struggle in general, ” Lonidier said. “For workers and union members, I hope to aid militancy and solidarity. ”
Electrical and computer engineer-ing professor Lea Rudee’s “Tijuana River” is a glimpse at the tremen-
dous diversity in scenery along a river that runs just 120 miles long. A series of 12 photographs taken by the artist in the ’90s, “River” initially appears a simple, aesthetically pleasing collection 
of landscapes. Upon closer examination, the shots begin to tell the story of the messy physical struggle between the San Diego and Tijuana communities — an issue that goes largely unnoticed by those on the cushy side of the border.
 The tale begins at the river’s end, in 
San Diego. Between chocolate-brown hills, Rudee captures the river at its fin-est: Stoic, bare trees stand amid calm, 
blue waters beneath open skies. Then, 
juxtaposed with this first image, cracked asphalt on the banks of murky waters represents the aftermath of the devastating 1993 flood which consumed everything in its path.
Rudee unleashes the most human element of his installation in a black-and-
white print depicting four undocumented migrant workers attempting to cross the colossal sewage channels surrounding the river, in order to break through the U.S. border. Four photographs later, an image of a homemade welcome sign equating undocumented aliens with garbage and sewage — made by residents of San Ysidro — reveals the harsh social backlash of entering America illegally.

Like fellow documentarian 
Morgan Spurlock, Josh Tickell holds a public grudge against 
McDonald’s. The only difference: In “Fuel, ” grease is good. Deep within oil-soaked fries, Tickell claims to have found the untapped secret to greener fuel: biodiesel. But in a 112-minute time slot that feels as tedious as the 11 years it took to make, Tickell painstakingly dissects the history of America’s addiction to foreign oil, relying on little more than celebrity name-drops and one-sided arguments as evidence.
The 2008 Sundance Audience 
Award for Best Documentary provides a realistic solution to severing depen-dence on foreign oil: the introduction of alternative fuel sources such as sus-tainable biofuels, biomass and plug-in hybrids. Sprinkled with interviews with Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson, Sheryl Crow and Julia Roberts, the film appeals to the unconverted, stick-shifting masses. But — trailing closely behind grassroots-advocating documentaries like “The 11th Hour” — “Fuel” is nothing new.
From the pulpit of his sunflower-
painted Winnebago, Tickell con-demns the sinfulness of America’s oil industry, detailing the ways in which it has poisoned the environ-ment and corrupted the government since Rockefeller first subverted the ethanol-fueled automobiles of Henry Ford by advancing prohibition. 
That dubiousness, Tickell argues, 
persisted in the hush-hush machina-tions of the Bush and Reagan admin-istrations, renders “Fuel” as politically charged as a Michael Moore expose. Pointing the finger at Bush for using 9/11 as impetus for foreign oil expen-ditures — and later exploiting the same imagery to tug at the audience’s heartstrings — Tickwell encourages viewers to embrace Flower Power at the expense of remaining unbiased.
Although his arguments are well-
grounded, mandated pity eclipses the resentment that “Fuel” otherwise foments toward Uncle Sam. Rather than scold Bush and Cheney for their oil-rigging exploits, Tickell focuses on painting Presidents Kennedy and Carter as saints for their fuel policies. 
Despite the documentary’s histri-
onic moral, Tickell’s passion seems genuine, drawing on the pathos of his childhood in Louisiana — a “Jurassic Park of oil and gas — to illustrate his point. As a young boy, he resented the state’s oil refineries for thwarting his ability to river raft through the blue bayous like Huck Finn.
While his vision for biodiesel and 
his filming techniques are equally savvy — he uses animated modules to break down the oil-refining pro-cess for us visual learners — periodic lecture-style narration dashes any chance for “Fuel” to surpass cynical expectations of being just another didactic documentary. 
The most notable proposal is 
algae biodiesel, which — in addition to providing net increase in renew-able energy — also metabolizes carbon dioxide. But regardless of the solutions “Fuel” presents, its lack of timeliness due to a delayed theatrical release in 2008 is difficult to ignore. Come on, the Obama campaign was last year’s news. Now what? 
“Fuel” may inspire you to use the 
compost bins at OVT, but its earnest efforts to be the little movie that could makes it unworthy of a trip to the theaters — just think of all the fuel you’ d be wasting.

STARRING JOSHUA TICKELL, WILLIE NELSON & SHERYL CROW   
DIRECTED BY JOSHUA TICKELL
NOT RATED 
01:52Christmas music.
Any Christmas song will do, really. 
From a Jackson Five-for-UNICEF 
tearjerker to more obscure (read: ter-rible) cut from Ringo Starr or, erm, Mariah Carey, nothing on Earth can set my kettle a-whistle like a jolly old holiday favorite. (I do understand that publicly airing this fact officially nulls anything snarky I want to say about music, ever again. But when Roy Orbison sends me “Pretty Paper” — shit; I could live forever pasty and happy in the glow of that comfort zone.)  
This year, at a criti-
cal stage in the La Jolla chill, there was one single solitary thing in the galaxy that could have prevented me from making my Ultimate X-mas Mix two months early.
Good news, particular-
ly for all you fools cozied up to my blown-out back-seat speakers this holiday season: My most true-to-art prayers have been answered. Just when it looked as if my bellybutton lint would never see static again, just when I was starting to accept early onset boring-hood as incurable — the Flaming Lips leaked two albums of decidedly indigestible Grinchy fluids all over the 
Internet last week, blowing spider-bite  
get-well kisses and mushy life-is-beautiful lullabies to the wind. 
If there’s one man who makes 
it unacceptable for any of us to feel old — but who’s been feeling a little too loverly for his own good lately — it’s Wayne Coyne. (I saw him in an airport once, Yoshimi  era. His suit 
was so sharp my ear buds fell out.)  Despite his 50 years, Coyne walks across crowds of happy people in an oversized beach ball for a living, nary a graying ringlet letting up its bounce on the comedown. But there’s been some-thing gross and hyperactive missing, as of late — I’m sure of it now. I start to feel no youthful bliss can be true and holy without an awkward squeak like “Rainin’ Babies” on the way out.
Look — I’m obviously just as fairy 
as the best of the Flamantics. More than anyone I have ever wanted to be, I have wanted to be Y oshimi. The only thing that has ever filled me with as much sheer wonder as a Christmas song is the crystallized climax of “Do 
Y ou Realize??”
At War With 
the Mystics was a 
little weirder — some much-needed sex hair — but way too half-baked Beck to resusci-tate me from a critical state of soft-boned twentysomething.
Though it may not 
turn these cheeks quite so holly-berry as a Beach Boys rendition 
of “Merry Christmas, Baby” — and really, what could? — the Lips’ new “I Can Be a Frog” is shaping up to be my new warm ‘n’ fuzzy place this season — my homecoming to the primordial mud puddle of cool, if you will. (And who would have known pop-art dar-ling Karen O would help set me back on the path to righteousness with her finest Gila monster impression?)
Even more thrilling is that a hand-
ful of deceptively sweet “Frogs” are 
Embryonic ’s mere portals to the dark 
side, making way for free jazz and stupid, fuzzy Doors impressions and ugly-ass rebellion without a cause. Heck, if Coyne can do it, so can I. What ever is this feeling? Time to get some feedback into my life again. Though the Stooges might just have to wait ’til spring.

MONDAY, OCT. 26 7:30 P .M.
Self-obsessed radio personality 
Hyun-Su (“My Sassy Girl”) counsels people on a popular call-in show. 
But when a young woman shows up on his doorstep claiming to be his illegitimate long-lost daughter, he is forced to confront his own problems, head on. To make matters worse, she has a six-year-old son of her own, making Hyun-Su a grandfather at 36. While the scandal turns the protagonist’s life upside down, freshman Korean director Hyeong-Cheol Kang presents the topic with 
clutch comedic timing and an adorable child actor to boot. 
Successful on both commercial and critical levels, the 
comedy is already slated for a Hollywood remake — 
better see what all the fuss is about.

THURSDAY, OCT. 15 9:40 P .M. 
Got a soft spot for bloodsuckers, but can’t stomach the mushy teenage “Twilight”

vampire thriller. When a blood transfusion goes 
awry during medical experiments, a selfless priest 
(“The Host”) is transformed into Korea’s own Edward 
Cullen — substituting sparkly skin for a pair of insatiable 
fangs. Much like his prepubescent counterpart, Wook’s anti-
hero lusts after a young woman who will test his animal instincts from every angle. But don’t expect butterfly kisses or unrequited love — after this blood-spewing teeth-marker, you may want to rethink your vampire love fantasy.

before the explosive-rich revenge plot of Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler, sans “300” abs), a family man 
who loses everything in a fatal home invasion.
Deep thinkers will 
appreciate the dichotomy of morality-based justice and legal-
ism, embodied by Shelton and Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) — a hotshot prosecutor who bends the truth to get ahead at work.
And homebodies will be warmed by Rice’s attempts 
at balancing work and family. That is, until Shelton sends Rice’s daughter a tape of a murderer being tortured.
Don’t expect a breath of fresh air: It takes only 10 min-
utes for Shelton’s life to be flipped upside down, and for Rice to cut a deal in exchange for guilty pleas. Before you’ve finished your first fistful of popcorn and even started thinking about that $5 soda, Shelton’s already halfway through his killing spree, and — in the “twist” that the trailer hypes — has handed himself over to the police.
Whenever Shelton appears on-screen, the theater crack-
les with vicious, expectant energy that grips the audience with the anticipation of a disappearing pencil trick. The writers don’t disap-
point, either: Shelton has all the calculated cruelty of a smartass Moriarty, wielding legal precedents with as much skill as his MacGyver-inspired death toys.
Rice is a little more disap-
pointing — though to be fair, Batman never quite equaled the Joker, either.
A believer in the system — 
partly because it’s worked so well for him — Mr. Assistant D.A. of Philly makes for a hell of a good guy in over his head 
— too good, in fact. To the point where his lapse into corruption feels tacked on.
The actors bring the film to life with a little help from 
Philadelphia itself. Gray milks the onetime capital for all it’s worth, creating a vivid neo-noire landscape nothing like Hollywood’s go-to thriller backdrop. The contrast of turn-of-the-century City Hall and Philly’s modern cement-scape makes for a poignant parallel of civilized rigmarole to Shelton’s primitive idea of justice without due process.
Nuanced as his social commentary might be, Gray 
crafts a taut, no-punches-pulled heart-racer that moves so fast, you’re neck’s already broken. And if it weren’t for the muscles in your face seizing up from that foolish grin, you’ d be hard pressed to believe that “Citizen” is almost two hours long. This isn’t just “Michael Baysplosion 2, ” either: This is the marriage of great plot, believable actors and a script too smart for its own good.

online and print out coupons.AL MVP Vladimir Guerrero, you know your 
offense has improved. Furthermore, with the addition of Scott Kazmir, improvements of Jered Weaver, continued development of Joe Saunders and always steady (and for the ladies, always sexy) John Lackey, the Angels maintain a pitching staff that allows them to succeed even when power numbers might be lacking. 
Bobby Abreu has been hailed as 
this season’s MVP for the Angels — and rightfully so. His presence and leadership has helped improve the team’s patience in players like Howie Kendrick, Kendry Morale and even the always free-swinging Guerrero.
The Y ankees, of course, are the 
epitome of the American League power attitude. They are also the reason why some people hate the American League. 
Furthermore, they are the 
reason why a lot of people hate America. Actually, they’re the epitome of everything that is or will ever be wrong with the world. Why do so many peo-ple hate the Y ankees? Well, it’s the same reason that so many people without any discernable connection to New Y ork love the Y ankees: Douchebags exist. 
Y ou see them every day. That guy in the 
tank top flashing his gigantic arms and the sock in his pants accentuating his small penis. That girl who wears makeup to the gym to compensate for her STDs. That guy on TV who makes more money than several small countries combined, broke up his marriage for Madonna, brings Kate Hudson to games and is now a mutated douchebaggy version of the natural athlete he was in Seattle, so that it’s hard to remember he’s the same person at all. 
Power on both sides of the ball pushed the 
Y ankees to a league-leading 103 wins during the regular season. The strength — be it natural or artificial — of Alex Rodriguez, Teixiera and cohorts, is matched by the hard throwing style of CC Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and B.S. Pettite (I felt like Andy needed some initials). Add a little bit of beefy Joba Chamberlain to the pot, and you’ve got yourself a stew of narcissism, overconfidence and victory.
The Angels and Y ankees fac-
ing off in the American League Championship Series is a true battle of National League vs. American League philosophy — a battle between playing it the right 
way and playing it to get paid. In my mind, a battle between good and evil. 
The Angels will supposedly own the 
Y ankees in the postseason, like the Red Sox previously owned the Angels. Of course, it’ d be nice to predict a shiny, perfect world where Angels fly high and good prevails, but we live in a world of douchebaggery — a world where the Evil Empire has home-field advantage.
So, Joe (regrettably) goes with: Y ankees in 
6 games.

Kemp as the go-to hitters for the LA offense, the Dodgers have relied on Manny less and less this season. Convenient, considering Manny the Tranny never fully returned after his 50-game suspension. 
Equally as important to LA's chances of 
victory is whether its starting rotation can overcome its inherent mediocraty to keep the team close enough for Eithier to deliver some late-game magic.
Considering that the 2009 
Dodgers have developed a knack for come-from-behind wins, it's a shame that LA fans at Chavez Ravine haven't seen any of them. It's kind of hard to see a walk-off win in the ninth inning when you leave before the seventh-inning stretch — a move for which LA fans are quite famous. 
And how pumped can a team 
get when its players are cheered by a half-empty stadium in pre-game introductions because its fans can't even show up until the third inning? A championship-worthy team is composed of many pieces, and a faithful (read: punctual) fan base is crucial.
For the Phillies to repeat as champions — 
which would be only the fourth time in history that a NL team has done so — their offense will have to maintain its beast mode, scoring at least enough runs to make sure that closer Brad Lidge isn’t allowed anywhere near a save situation. The Phil’s lineup is flat-out scary, and more 
than enough to send Dodgers skipper Joe Torre running for a new pair of Depends. With Cliff Lee anchoring a pitching staff that includes two Cy Y oung winners and last year’s World Series MVP , the City of Brotherly Love seems primed for a second-straight parade through the streets 
of South Philly.
While I have no real affinity 
for either of these teams — and actual hatred for one of them — I am proud to have either one as the National League's representative in the World Series. Both teams play a hustle style of baseball and are anchored by a core of young players brought up through their respective farm systems. Any team would kill to have Chase Utley or James Looney in a clutch situation. Y oung lefties Clayton Kershaw and Cole Hamels have already won on the big stage, and are a GM's ultimate wet dream. These two teams are what NL baseball is all about.
Will the Dodgers be able to 
extract revenge on the Phillies after getting handed their own asses in five games last season? Or will Cole Hamels return to his 2008 form to complement Lee for the league’s best one-two punch? Which of these two National League teams will prevail?
Considering I own a T-shirt that reads, 
“Duck the Fodgers, ” it gives me great pleasure to say: Blanc goes with: Phillies in 7 games.
It’d be nice to 
predict a shiny, perfect world where Angels ﬂy high, but we live in a world of douche-baggery — a world where the Evil Empire has home-ﬁeld advantage.Lefties Clayton Kershaw and Cole Hamels have already won on the big stage, and are a GM’s ultimate wet dream.

period, the Anteaters extended their advantage when they 
scored two fourth-quarter goals to secure an 8-5 lead. Senior two-meter defender Peter Gresham and Roberts gave the Tritons a chance when Gresham scored at the 1:26 mark to cut the margin by two. With 47 seconds remain-ing, Roberts converted on a man-up opportunity to pull the Tritons within one — but the late-game surge was not enough to overtake the Anteaters, and UCI held on for the 8-7 win. 
The Tritons opened the tournament on Oct. 10 facing 
their toughest rivals: the LMU Lions. In a 10-6 defeat, the Tritons trailed 5-2 at the end of the first half, and were never quite able to claw their way back into the game. 
“ Against LMU, we are still figuring out some tactical 
ways to address the team, ” Roberts said. “The important thing is that every time we play them, we learn new things about their strategy, and that will pay off later at [the Western Water Polo Association Championships]. ”  
  In their match against Pacific, UCSD fared much bet-
ter. Pacific narrowed UCSD’s lead to 6-5, but senior two-meter defender Steven Donohoe fired in goals to boost the Triton advantage to 8-5. In the final period, UCSD’s defense held Pacific to zero scores, securing the win.  
With the 2-2 showing at the tournament, the Tritons’ 
record now stands at 9-9 for the season.  
“ At this point in the season, it’s all about taking steps 
forward and not backward, ” Roberts said. “Right now, we need to play more physical ball with a determination. ”
UCSD is back in action this Friday, Oct. 16, when the 
Tritons will host the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos.

— become National Champions 
in the 100-meter freestyle and the 200-meter breaststroke, respectively. Additionally, McGihon was recog-nized as the Pacific Coast Swim and Diving Coach of the Y ear.
In order to live up to their his-
tory, the team will be counting on a large contingent of underclassman swimmers, who will make up 17 of the 23 spots on the men’s roster and 23 of 29 on the women’s. 
McGihon is quick to quell any 
concern that the underclassmen may not be ready. 
“We’re very excited about 
this year’s recruiting class — the best we’ve had in school history, ” McGihon said.
Based on the results of the annual 
intersquad Blue vs. Gold Meet that took place on Oct. 10, there is little evidence to the contrary. 
McGihon said the meet was a 
good opportunity for the team to  gauge its strengths and weaknesses. The team started its first preseason meet off right, collectively breaking nine meet records. 
The blue women emerged victo-
rious over their gold-team counter-parts by a score of 137-126, while the gold men held on for a tight 128-126 
victory over the blue team. 
The story of the day, however, 
was the record-breaking perfor-
mances of freshman Adam Rice and sophomore Alex Henley, who broke two meet records apiece. 
Rice set all-time men’s meet 
records in both the 300-yard indi-vidual medley and the 150-yard fly. Henley did the same in the women’s record books, for the 150-yard back-
stroke and the 300-yard individual 
medley.
After his first collegiate-level 
meet, Rice offered a humble reflec-tion on his performance.
“I tried to keep up a positive 
mindset, and to be OK with how I do, but to push my body as far as it can in every individual race, ” Rice said. “I want to hold that mindset 
throughout the rest of the year, since i t  h a s  w o r k ed  f o r  m e  so  w e ll  i n  th e  past. ”
The Tritons’ next meet is on 
Oct. 24, when they host Claremont-Mudd-Scripps; the meet will again be held at the Cathedral Catholic 
High School pool.
“I think our main goal, of course, 
is to better what was done last year, ” 
Rice said. “I think this year — with all of the fast freshmen we have — we can achieve that and most likely do more than expected. ”

▶ SWIVE, MYVTWHNLhe said. “Bad weather fixes my game.  A lot of players hit the ball high, but I hit it low, so playing in the wind doesn’t affect me as much.  It gives me an advantage. ”
Senior Raj Samra finished one 
stroke behind Okasaki, with back-to-back rounds of 76. Sophomore Michael Tilghman’s performance dipped after previously leading the Tritons in Washington two weeks ago, and junior Brian Olshock played his first season  tournament.
 Junior-college transfer Richard 
Morris — finally OKed by the NCAA Clearinghouse, after updating his amateur status — competed in his first Division II tournament as a Triton. Morris shot rounds of 77 and 79, finishing in a tie for 48th. While he was not entirely satisfied with his per-formance, he did note some big differ-ences between playing Division II and at the junior-college level.
“It was pretty apparent in my first 
event that if you don’t play well, it will show, ” Morris said. “The competition here is at the next level. Some say the Division II isn’t the greatest, but there is a high level of golf out there. ”
  Individually, UCSD is reaching 
top form; however, the men are strug-gling as a team. Wydra’s squad did not post low scores during the opening round of either tournament this sea-son, but seemed to have fewer prob-lems in rounds two and three.  
The Tritons are averaging nine 
strokes better in the second and third rounds, compared to their first round. 
Wydra said the team’s struggle is 
like that of a running back needing the first hit of a game before hitting his stride.
“We always play better as we get 
going, ” Wydra said. “We need to just stay in our routine and get into auto-matic. I also think some of it is team chemistry. The teams that have started out better than us have been playing together longer. If we can get one guy going, I think others will follow. ”
The Tritons have their top four 
golfers in place, but are still looking to fill the all-important fifth spot for next week’s Sonoma State Invitational.  Because collegiate golf uses the best 
four of a team’s five individual scores for a team total, the fifth spot provides some cushioning.
“It’s hard when two guys play bad 
in the same round, ” Okasaki said.  “We need that fifth guy to contribute. Y ou can’t expect the top four to play well every round. It’s just unreasonable. ”
Wydra will take Okasaki, Samra, 
Morris, Tilghman and the to-be-determined fifth player to Sonoma next week. Last season, UCSD fin-ished eighth, with Okasaki and Samra finishing in a tie for 24th. 
Considering their familiarity with 
the Sonoma course, both players are expected to perform well this week.
“Knowing that I’ve played a couple 
of good rounds on the course before is a huge benefit, ” Okasaki said.  “It gives me confidence knowing that I have done well there before. We have been really underachieving as a team with the talent we have.  I’ve had the chance to play with our top four, and we’re all starting to play really well. ”

 This Day In History
On Oct. 15, 1923, the New York Yankees 
won their first-ever World Series Championship, beating cross-town rival the New York Giants 4-2. The title was the first of the Yankees majors-best 26 world championships.
The National League represents 
everything that is good and pure about the game of baseball, by virtue 
of two simple qualities: All of our pitchers hit, and nobody plays in Y ankee pinstrips.
Rule changes and money-grubbing 
dynasties not enough to convince you? The NL also holds the all-time hits, home runs 
(both tainted and clean) and single-season 
batting-average records. Suck on that, American League offenses. 
So now that we've established the NL 
as the best representative of our national pastime — and America itself by default — let’s take a look at this year’s National League Championship Series, and at the two teams who will battle it out for the NL Pennant.
This year’s NLCS pits reigning world 
champions the Philadelphia Phillies against the (dreaded) Los Angeles Dodgers. Both of these teams dominated their respective divisions throughout the season, and won their division series with relative ease. 
Granted, a Matt Holliday dropped fly 
ball and a Huston Street implosion had just as much to do with their victories, but both teams are primed for an epic showdown. The winner of the showdown, of course, gets the privilege of taking down whichever overpaid AL team survives the ego-feeding photo shoot they call a championship series. 
This marks the fifth time in history 
that the Phillies and Dodgers have faced off in the NLCS. Not to mention, it's an exact rematch of last year’s championship series, —guaranteeing a string of drama and history-making moments.
The Dodgers’ chance of winning rests 
largely on which Manny shows up: the fertility-fueled hitting machine or the over-the-hill juicer going through withdrawal. With the rise of Andre Eithier and Matt 
The American League represents change. The American League rep-resents development. The American 
League represents the future.
Some feel that the designated-hitter 
rule ripped baseball from its roots. But the truth is that having a guy who just hits — just like having a person who just 
pitches — is all about specialization. And 
specialization — more than hot dogs, apple pie and Oprah — is what defines America. That’s exactly why the American League is the epitome of our national pastime.
In actuality, baseball is baseball, and 
people who try to point to the discrep-ancy between the National League and American League (small ball vs. long ball) are obviously not paying attention to the 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Located 
in Orange County off Katella, Though Y ou Can Also Take State College Boulevard to Get There. Since Mike Scioscia took over the 
Angels, the team has been the epitome of an American League club sticking to National League strategy. Even with sign-ings of big bats like Vladimir Guerrero and the rental of Mark “Pussy-Whipped” Teixeira, the Angels have maintained a philosophy of getting on base, moving runners, manufacturing runs and trusting their pitching staff to maintain any lead 
they’ve built. The strategy led the team to 
their first World Series in 2002, when they defeated the Giants with such soon-to-be-forgotten stalwarts as Scott Spiezio, Brad Fullmer, Aaron Sele, Kevin Appier and the very un-ace-like Jarrod Washburn.
The Angels’ strength this season has 
been its resilience and depth following the death of pitcher Nick Adenhart. When other teams are pitching to get to former <W]ZVIUMV\

SWIMMING & DIVING —  The UCSD swimming 
and diving team has faced some very serious chal-lenges at the start of the 2009-10 season — but if its record-breaking first meet is any indicator, there shouldn’t be much more trouble in the water.
Though the team’s practices are usually held at 
Canyon View Aquatic Center, players and coaches were forced to move their preparations to nearby Cathedral Catholic High School when the UCSD steam room exploded. Needless to say, early sea-son preparations have not been ideal.
“We’ve had to make a lot of sacrifices and com-promises without trying to compromise training, ” head coach Scott McGihon said. “We’re in a posi-tion now of having to drive down to Coronado, where we train for three to four hours at a high school. ”
Adding to the Tritons’ location problems is a 
rocky transition period to a new set of competi-tors after losing several key members of the strong 2008-09 squad. 
During last year’s campaign both the men and 
women’s teams won the Pacific Coast Swimming Conference Championships in Long Beach, send-ing a combined 26 student athletes to the NCAA Division II National Championships.

MEN’S WATER POLO — Competing 
alongside several of the nation’s top teams, the No. 11 men’s water-polo team returned from their Southern California tournament, from Oct. 10 to Oct., 11 with mixed results.  
The Tritons split their games 
on both days of the UC Irvine Invitational, first falling 10-6  to long-time rival No. 5 Loyola Marymount before picking up an 8-5 win over No. 13 Pacific. Day two saw the Tritons lose a hard-fought game 8-7 to No. 9 UC Irvine, but they ended on a high note when UCSD defeated No. 12 UC Davis for the third consecutive time this season, in a resounding 11-4 victory.     
“In college polo, it’s important to 
be able to swim up and down the pool at an elite level, ” senior driver Sean Roberts said. “In the games against UC Davis and Pacific, we played up to the physicality that both teams brought. It was actually fun getting into it with them. The same can be said about Irvine. It was a hard physi-cal game, and we just came up short one goal in the end. ” 
The Tritons put together a bal-
anced attack with seven players contributing offensively. Holding a slight 3-2 advantage at the end of the first quarter, UCSD then scored the first four goals of the second quarter to snatch a 7-2 lead and ultimately gain control of the contest. On solid defense, the Tritons held the Aggies to one goal in the second half, enabling UCSD to cruise to an 11-4 win.
Senior Steven Donohoe led the 
Tritons with three goals. Senior driver Bryce Madsen and junior driver Ryan Allred added two goals apiece. Senior utility Ian Bausback, senior drivers Sean Roberts and Kneif Lohse and junior driver Sean Cruz also scored toward UCSD’s win.

MEN’S GOLF —  Gusty winds and a 
steady downpour forced tournament officials to suspend play after only two rounds at the Oct. 12 InterWest Wildcat Classic. The Tritons fin-ished in a soggy eighth place at the rain-shortened event, and are now fine-tuning for the Sonoma State Invitational on Oct. 19 to Oct. 20.  
A rarity on the West Coast, the 
suspended tournament was the first since the 2005-06 season, when the downpour was so heavy that players were using bunker rakes to squeegee water from the greens. Head coach Mike Wydra asked for play to be sus-pended at that tournament, much like he did this week in Chico.
“The veteran coaches took a look 
at the weather report and lobbied against starting [the third round], ” he said. “Once you start the round, you have to finish it. The game stops being a test of golf ability and starts being a test of the bad conditions.  Eighty-three becomes a good score, and no one wants to shoot a good eighty-three. ”
Junior Keith Okasaki, who sur-
vived winds gusting upward of 45 mph,  and was the low man for UCSD on the 6,906 yard, par 72 Butte Creek Country Club course. His total of 151 tied him for 26th place. 
Okasaki struggled through the first 
14 holes on Monday, before Wydra provided him a crucial swing tip that turned his game around.
“It was something simple that 
made a big change, ” Okasaki said. “I was really struggling, so I asked if [Wydra] could follow me and give me some advice. It’s a bad habit, and the same problem I had in Washington. ”
After Wydra’s tip, Okasaki finished 
his final three holes of the first round one-under par, and cruised through round two at even-par.  Having finally found the glitch in his swing, he was looking forward to the third round, but Mother Nature wasn’t having it.
“I really wanted to keep playing, ”
