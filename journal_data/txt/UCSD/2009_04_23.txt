San Diego and UCSD police 
arrived at North Torrey Pines Road 
Monday night after witnesses report-ed a stabbing at Black’s Beach involv-ing two alleged gang members.
A fight broke out between two Latino males near the Black’s Beach Dumpsters between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., witnesses said.
After sustaining two knife 
wounds, the victim made his way up the cliffs to the edge of Eleanor Roosevelt College, where he flagged down a UCSD police officer just after 10 p.m.
The second male was unharmed.A witness at Asia Hall described 
the victim as a 20-year-old Latino male wearing a white shirt and plaid shorts, adding that the victim was conscious and breathing but refused medical attention.He was taken to Scripps Memorial 
Hospital and subsequently released with non-life-threatening injuries.
SDPD officers had direct contact 
with both parties, but neither would cooperate with police questioning, and the victim did not wish to press charges, officials said.
This incident marks the second 
stabbing at Black’s in the past year. In July 2008, an unidentified victim was stabbed in the side after a late-night “drum circle” ended in a large brawl.

The fate of the Grove Caffe still hangs in 
the balance today, after Associated Students President Donna Bean contested the council’s vote to preserve the struggling enterprise at a meeting last night.
After nearly three hours of discussion, 15 
councilmembers voted in favor of ceasing Grove operations, while 11 voted for the cafe to remain open. The vote was taken under the 
presumption that a two-third majority was nec-
essary to approve the motion.
However, Bean contested the grounds upon 
which the two-thirds requirement was origini-ally implemented. 
Council chair Jordan Taylor said that 
according to council bylaws, the fact that Grove employees’ paid positions were at stake neces-sitated the two-thirds rule. Bean countered this by saying that because only a simple majority is required to create an A.S. enterprise, the vote to cease cafe operations should have been subject to the same rules.
The dispute will now go before the A.S. 
Judicial Board, a body composed of seven non-council students appointed by the president. The board will hear both sides of the argument and determine a ruling by majority vote. 
The controversy over the council’s vote last 
night was prefaced by an animated discussion of the merits of allowing the Grove to remain open. 
Councilmembers on both sides of the debate 
expressed concern over the cafe’s value to the campus community, the recent failure of the 
Grove as a profitable enterprise and the mon-
etary commitment that would be necessary to revive the business. University Centers Business Officer John 
Hughes told councilmembers that updating the Grove to modern operating standards would likely run in excess of $350,000. Many on the council were unwilling to commit this type of funding to the Grove, which is roughly $126,000 in debt. 
“The influx of money that would be needed 
to salvage the Grove is not an appropriate use of funds, ” Revelle College Senator Katie Hall said.
Still, others see hope for the cafe. Some 
councilmembers referred to the coming closure of Sierra Summit and El Mercado, stating that the Grove could easily fill the vacuum left by these eateries, seizing upon the opportunity to develop an expanded customer base.
“The fact of the matter is that once people 
come to the Grove, they come back, ” student manager Frank Thomas said. “The hardest part is getting them to come in the first time. ”
Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Naasir Lakahni is confident that the Grove 
A.S. president contests vote 
to maintain cafe operations, claims simple majority should have been required to approve  Grove’s closure.

The annual Muirstock festival 
may be noticeably scaled back next 
year after a John Muir College stu-dent fee referendum on the 2009 Associated Students election ballot failed to gain approval, leaving the council short on funds.
Designed to provide the Muir 
College Council with funding to support Muir’s student organiza-tions and various tradition events — including Muirstock and Muir Musical — the referendum would have raised the Muir College Activity Fee to $10 from the exist-ing $7. 
The increase was rejected by a 
margin of 89 votes. 
Over the last several years, the 
A.S. Council has gradually cut funding for college councils, leaving them to seek out alternative sources of cash. 
The Sixth College Council ran 
an activity fee referendum in the recent election that passed success-fully. Last year, Earl Warren College students also voted to approve a similar  referendum.
Muir College Council Vice Chair 
Abbas Hussain said the additional fees would have been key in facili-tating the enhancement of annu-al programs and events put on by Muir’s many student organizations.
“We named it the Giving Fee 
because it was a fee students were paying to give back to themselves in the form of a better college experi-ence, ” Hussain said.
According to Muir College coun-
cilmembers, the college’s annual events may have to be scaled back next year, and student organizations will likely see an across-the-boardcut in funding. Councilmembers said fewer bands may appear at next year’s Muirstock festival to compen-sate for the lack of funds. 
This year, councilmembers were 
forced to draw $10,500 from their

reserve fund of $18,485 to support 
the cost of Muirstock. The festival typically costs the council upwards of $20,000. 
“If the referendum passed, then 
MCC could have used that addi-tional money to support Muir orga-nizations instead of tapping into our reserve, ” Muir College Council Environmental Advocate Martin Kwok said.
Muir College Dean of Student 
Affairs Patricia Mahaffey said the council will not have as much dis-cretionary money to support stu-dent organizations next year. 
Muir College freshman Joe 
Hua said he saw no need for a fee increase.
“I didn’t know how I or my peers 
would benefit from paying more tuition than we already do, ” he said. “It seems like we are already paying a lot for activities, and if Muir is able to put on activities now, I didn’t see how the fee increase would prevent them from happening in the future. ”
But Muir College freshman 
Monica Chen said she saw the ref-erendum as a way to enhance Muir activities.
“The Giving Fee seemed like a 
great way to help out the different clubs and organizations in Muir, ” she said. “They’ve always put on fun events like Muirstock and Muir Musical, and I figured, ‘Why not pay a little more to make them even more eventful?’”
MCC freshman representative 
Frank Chang said he would support another referendum in the upcom-ing Fall Quarter, an option that the council is considering. However, this would require a special elec-tion, which would cost the council around $3,000.
Next year’s newly elected MCC 
members will convene next week to discuss their operating budget for the 2009-10 academic year. They 
plan to review the expenses of stu-dent organizations for the following school year with the Muir Funding Advisory Board, and based on their financial needs, will decide whether to run another referendum. 
At a recent meeting, the council 
addressed the need to downscale on big-ticket events such as Muirstock,
Muir Musical and Burnout,  but decided that it will do everything it can to not abandon these events altogether.
“I feel that over the past few 
years, organizations have not been getting the funding they have asked for, and due to this, we have seen students use a lot of creativity and ingenuity to make events happen and be successful, ” Hussain said. “But at the end of the day this can only go so far, and it will be noticed next year. ”

can succeed as a profitable enter-prise once the burden of nonstudent manager Cleveland Thomas’ $50,000 annual salary is removed. Thomas’ departure would also mean the cafe would close during the summer months, saving it thousands of dol-lars in operating costs. 
Lakhani presented financial 
projections demonstrating that the Grove would have reported a sub-stantial profit this year had these measures been adopted earlier.
“If we had made these changes a 
year ago, we would’ve seen $12,000 in profit from the Grove, ” Lakhani said.
Hughes echoed Lakhani’s senti-
ment.“One of the things that’s very clear 
is that the Grove’s business model right now is not financially viable, ” he said. “ A large part of that is the non-student manager getting paid a salary 12 months out of the year. ”
Despite these projections, many on 
the council worry that the Grove will fail to see any significant profit and will continue to drain student funds.
“The Grove’s model is no longer 
viable in that space, ” Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Lana Blank said. “Pretty much everything it does is also available nearby. … No matter how much money you put into it, it’s not going to turn around. ”
However, Frank, along with fel-
low student manager Autumn Hays, 
believes the Grove will see a boost in profits once the cafe adopts a new business model designed to cater to upperclassmen, graduate stu-dents and staff. They plan to shift the Grove’s emphasis from espresso to food, including hot sandwiches and pizza. 
Frank also said he would like to 
see greater communication from councilmembers regarding the cafe’s financial performance and daily operations, in addition to more council support in organizing events designed to attract business to the Student Center.

at rfarazma@ucsd.edu.Big topics were discussed at last night’s meeting, though the future the Grove Caffe was a 
huge source of contention in particu-lar, a question that was not satisfac-torily put to rest despite some three hours of discussion.
The council perused through other 
legislation, including a Resolution Against the Usage of Registration Fees to Offset State Budget Deficiencies, which was passed unanimously after making minor adjustments to its lan-guage.
Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garrett Berg  mod-
eled one of the eight attractive Sun God T-shirt designs and told the council that Sun God mer-chandise would be on sale next Monday. This year’s Sun God line includes the afore-mentioned T-shirts, booty shorts and sustainable water bottles — which goes along with the green-oriented Bring Y our Own Bottle campaign.  
He added that this year the 
Programming Office and Alumni Association have teamed up to offer discounted tickets for alumni for the first time: $5 off for general alumni, $10 off for Alumni Association mem-bers and $15 off for Lifetime member alumni.
Berg also gleefully announced that 
Chilean actor and comedian Horatio Sanz would headline the comedy act for the festival.
John Condello , the A.S. repre-
sentative from the nonaffiliate speech policy committee, gave his two cents on the current draft of the policy, which he regards as extremely restric-tive. He expressed his disdain for free speech zones and recommended that the A.S. Council not let the policy pass as it currently stands.
The next two and a half hours or 
so were spent discussing the fate of the Grove Caffe. Grove manager Thomas 
Frank  actively and passionately insert-
ed himself into the discourse to defend the cafe against the flurry of attacks made against its current financil situa-tion and business model.
John Hughes, the business officer 
of Student Life, offered some back-ground on the failing enterprise as well as critiques of the council.
“ A.S. beats the drum of owner-
ship, ” Hughes said. “One of things in 
A.S. is that A.S. isn’t very good at it. We don’t own things very well. ”
A travel fund-
ing request from the Koala  for $400 
to attend Second United Comedy 
Knowledge Organizational Field Forum (S.U.C.K.O.F.F.) was ques-tioned since the event can be found nowhere online.
Vice President of External Affairs 
Lisa Chen  was so infuriated by the 
discussion that she passionately stomped out of the forum, banging the side door as she exited before quietly returning to her seat 30 sec-onds later.
Other councilmembers found it 
silly to scrutinize the funding request when the finance committee had already approved the item, but the decision was nevertheless tabled for a week so that the council can inves-tigate whether or not the event truly exists.
Finally, the council approved lan-
guage for the Student Organization Funding Advisory Board to finally complete the new student organiza-tion funding process.

As the state budget crisis con-
tinues flapping its venge-ful wings and public sec-
tors from every corner of California brace for the inevitable impacts to services that result from funding cuts, UC administrators have responded in various ways: increasing student fees, suspending services, freezing execu-tive pay, reshuffling administrative departments and even decreasing the number of students admitted to the 10-campus system.
At UCSD, however, the Student 
Affairs Office has indicated it will go one sketchy step further, combating the state’s financial neglect with a proposal to lasso a portion of student registra-tion fees — meant to support services such as Student Health, Counseling and Psychological Services, the Career Services Center and the University Events Office, to name a few — and redistribute the money to academic components such as admissions, main-taining class availability, staff salaries and inflation adjustments.
But considering that registration 
fees are meant to be used to support student services that are complementa-ry to the university’s academic mission (the UC Board of Regents separated the registration and educational fees in the 1970s for that specific purpose), the plan will only serve to harm stu-dents — yet another shocking insult to the very group the university is sup-posed to be serving.
The most disconcerting aspect of 
UCSD’s plan to funnel registration fees away from student services is the fact that nobody knows about it. The A.S. Council passed a resolution last night calling for university transpar-ency, but let’s face it — resolutions go a whole lot of nowhere. The UC Planning and Budget Manual specifi-cally states that “the use of university registration fee income be limited to support of student services and facili-ties” and “current university policy requires that the university registra-tion fee … be the primary funding source for certain student services concerned with student well-being and not related to instructional pro-grams. ” Administrators are in essence breaking their own policy, and they’re going about it in the most shady way possible.
Although university operations 
have taken a hit with reductions in state funding, the registration fee is static: It’s a fixed fee that does not fluctuate because every student who attends the university must pay it. Registration fees were increased by 10 percent last year in response to student concerns that essential services such as mental-health support lacked funding.
It’s preposterous the university is now slipping those funds away from us, without making it a public move. If the university needed money for academic departments, that concern should have been raised through an alteration of educational fees, not by taking away our registration fees now; more importantly, students should be notified through e-mail, newsletter or TritonLink that this is even an issue.
The Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee — including many student representatives — is in the process of reviewing all services funded by reg-istration fees, and is accounting for a possible cut of up to 15 percent. The final determination will be made in summer, when the university’s operat-ing budget is finalized. RFAC is also debating whether to rank services or implement an across-the-board cut. 
The committee will hold a pub-
lic forum at a yet-to-be-determined date later this quarter to gauge stu-dent concerns. It’s essential that stu-dents come to this forum to demand that administrators leave our reg-istration-fee-funded services intact. Otherwise, a dangerous precedent will be set, and student services will continue to diminish.

Contributing Writer  
NATIONAL NEWS  — April is 
Financial Literacy Month, accord-ing to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, but a new study suggests that col-lege students are financially illiterate — prompting the need for schools to educate their students on finance fundamentals and debt management.
According to a report released by 
college financing company Sallie Mae, the average college student’s credit-card debt in 2008 was estimated at $3,173 — 46 percent more than in 2004 and nearly $1,000 more than when the company began collecting such data in 1998. There isn’t a trend in improvement either — graduating seniors were shown to be even fur-ther in debt with an average balance of $4,100. Of the 1,200 undergradu-ates surveyed, 60 percent said they were unaware of their high credit-
card debts, and 40 percent knowingly 
charged items to their cards despite being unable to pay.
Unsurprisingly, this increase in stu-
dent debt coincides with another trend: the rising cost of school. According to the College Board, the average tuition cost and fees of public four-year uni-versities in the United States have risen 50 percent in the past decade to $6,585 
a year, prompting more students to charge their educational expenses on 
credit cards. The Sallie Mae study con-cluded that students charged an aver-age of $2,200 in educational expenses on credit cards alone.
It’s an alarming trend, and in the 
wake of a credit crunch that has made investors hesitant to back private stu-dent loans, many students have turned to credit cards, which are more acces-sible, as a last resort.
College students are an ideal demo-
graphic for credit-card companies to target — without credit histories or adequate understanding of credit and debt, many students are given a smooth introduction into the world of personal finance and responsibility with enticing low-interest teaser offers, only to find themselves stuck trying to pay off enormous debts with interest rates much higher than they expected.
Some credit-card contracts also 
contain hidden language such as uni-versal default clauses, which change the terms of the contract if customers forgo payments with other lenders. Students who don’t read their con-tracts’ fine print can often spiral into large amounts of debt and quickly and severely damage their credit for 
defaulting on something as minor as a 
monthly utility bill. This in turn makes it increasingly difficult to obtain other types of loans, like student loans, as companies are reluctant to lend to those with bad credit.
With so many students digging 
their financial graves so early, many states have pushed to regulate the mar-keting of credit cards on college cam-
puses in order to protect them from 
deceptive marketing practices.
Fortunately, California has taken such initiative with the passage of the College Student Credit Protection Act in 2007, which prohibits universities from giving material incentives to get students to sign up for credit cards. 
Prominent consumer advocacy 
groups have also taken a stand against the aggressive marketing of credit cards to college students on campus. Such efforts include a counter-marketing campaign by public advocacy group CalPIRG at UC Davis that distributes educational materials to students on campus about the dangers of credit and excess spending.
Still, the trend of increasing credit-
card usage and accumulation of debt among students is cause for concern. As a rule of thumb, a person shouldn’t have more than one credit card. Perhaps the most alarming statistic in the Sallie Mae study was that the aver-age American college student carries 4.6 credit cards, with over half of all students owning four credit cards or more — a strong indicator of overall mismanagement and, assuming that most students are not employed full-time, a dangerous propensity for living well beyond their means.
Currently, the university does not 
accept credit-card payments on man-datory student fees, such as tuition and dormitory housing, a commendable countermeasure against what could otherwise be an inclination among 
many students to rely on credit to 
cover such high costs. Still it’s evident that students are unaware of how their spending habits now could adversely affect them later.
Director of Student Business 
Services James Myers said the American adult and student popu-
lation does not know enough about credit-card debt and its consequences, and that a seminar or workshop on credit and debt education would help equip students with the knowledge to make better financial decisions. 
But in light of recent budget cuts, 
the university would be hard-pressed to offer such instruction through any of the administrative offices — a big commitment considering that it is operating with reduced staffing. Currently, Student Business Services offers tips on how to develop sensible spending habits and avoid the pitfalls of credit-card debt. But the message hasn’t gotten out to everyone yet. 
A good first step would be for 
the university to survey students, both incoming and current, on their knowl-edge of personal financing as well as their spending habits — in the same vein as the e-CHUG online survey used to gather data on student alcohol and drug use. Based on these results, the university could gauge the neces-sity and practicality of an educational program where students could develop a basic understanding of credit, debt and sensible spending habits. The uni-versity is notorious for its opposition to student alcohol use and enforcement 
of its zero-tolerance policy, but the 
problem of rising student debt war-rants far more concern. A course in financial management fundamentals would go a long way in helping stu-dents develop financial security now and avoid years of debt later. Because, unlike alcohol, debt doesn’t leave the system — it only gets worse.

That bottle of Aquafina — yeah, that one — you’re paying way too much for it. There’s a more 
affordable and accessible alternative from your friend, the faucet.
After seeing the shocking number 
of empty bottles that my roommates were lugging over to recycle at Vons, I switched over from bottled water to tap. It just doesn’t make sense to drink from a bottle when you look at the environmental and monetary waste 
associated with doing so.
This Monday, during Earth Week’s 
Trash Sort, I went through three 
Dumpsters’ worth of garbage. By the end, there was a towering mound of recovered recyclable goods — the majority of them plastic water bottles. Y ou don’t need to go through trash cans for plastic bottles, but everyone should do their part to recycle by being conscious of their waste. It would pre-vent bottles from being sent to landfills and it would save me from awkward stares as I reach into trashcans to fish out plastic water bottles.
According to the Earth Policy 
Institute, last year the United States spent $15 billion on bottled water — the amount it would cost to provide clean drinking water to the entire world. Somehow we’ve gotten into the habit of paying good money for a product we’ve always had for much cheaper. Of course, we’re all victims to safety concerns and taste preferences — but never fear, there are alternatives.
For cash-strapped college students, 
the kitchen sink and water fountains are cost-effective solutions. If you were to purchase a 20-ounce bottle for a dol-lar, you’ d be paying nearly $6 per gal-lon. Y ou’ d complain about gas prices at that level, but most people don’t think twice when the product in question is a bottle of drinking water. Y es, water is essential, but the bottle isn’t. About 90 percent of the cost of bottled water is due to the bottle itself; bottled water can range from 1,000 and 10,000 times the cost of public tap water. The price of tap water in San Diego is $0.004 per gallon. Regardless of how much water you drink, switching from bottled to tap would save you a handful.
Some people drink bottled water 
for safety reasons, but tap water is actually tested more often and has higher regulations for contaminants than bottled water. Bottled-water com-panies are not required to notify their customers if their water is contami-nated, or, in most states, to tell their customers about their water’s origins or purification process. That means you very well could be drinking bot-tled tap water. 
Taste is a big factor but that has to 
do with the filtration process. That’s 
why some bottled-water companies 
are just filtering tap water, bottling it and marking up its price to make a profit. In July 2007, Pepsi-Cola (the owner of Aquafina) revealed that it bottled tap water. Twenty-four percent of the bottled water we buy is tap water repackaged by Coke and Pepsi. Forty percent of bottled water is simply fil-tered municipal water. Y ou can do

 Ad Deadline is Friday, May 8this at home with a Brita pitcher or a 
faucet-filter adapter (they cost about $20 and will get you several hundred gallons of water).
Bottled water is convenient, but 
comes at a high price when you con-sider the waste it generates. An equally convenient and reusable alternative is purchasing a stainless-steel bottle (why steel? Google BPA). Y ou can fill it with filtered tap water at home and refill on the run at a water fountain. Typically, it wouldn’t cost you more than 30 or 40 seconds to quench your thirst. 
The bookstore is currently giving 
out $5 vouchers for Klean Kanteen bottles when you bring in a plastic bottle to trade. Y ou’ll make up the price of the bottle in no time and also reduce the number of plastic bottles that are produced. 
The Social and Environmental 
Sustainability Committee has been working toward expanding public water infrastructure (installing reus-able water bottle friendly fountains and filtered fountains) and phasing out bottled water on campus. The Food Co-op took bottled water off its shelves and replaced it with free fil-tered tap water for its customers. The A.S. Council has also taken a stance by passing a resolution in support of elim-inating bottled water and encouraging the university to issue a campuswide policy to eliminate the purchase and sale of bottled water by June 2009. The UCSD Climate Action Plan aims to supply new water fountains and water distribution stations to reduce need for bottled water and obtain a commit-ment from the administration to allow bottled water contracts to expire. 
Unless it’s an emergency, opt for the 
tap. If you can’t do that, please cut back. It would bring down the cost for water and reduce our greenhouse-gas emis-sions, water consumption and waste generation. In the spirit of Earth Week, try it out. A DROP FROM  THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
Walking across the UCSD campus 
each day are dozens of Armenian stu-dents — students whose ethnic history pulses with an unforgettable incident of cultural persecution that remains pain-fully relevant to them and to today’s anxious world: the Armenian geno-cide of 1915, the Ottoman Empire’s destruction of more than 1 million Armenians, commemorated world-wide every April 24. 
But how can an event that hap-
pened 94 years ago still be relevant with the other crises currently raging across the globe?
Quite easily.The Ottoman government’s desire 
to “cleanse”  minorities and create a 
Pan-Turkish state has been well documented. Records reveal that the Ottoman Empire was particularly intent on annihilating the Armenian race, which had become so successful within its country — a country with much territory previously belonging to ancient Armenia. The annihilation of the Armenian race would be the first genocide of the 20th century, one that Adolf Hitler studied in prepara-tion for his own Holocaust years later.
Government archives in Turkey 
and around the world have proof of these goals. Y et Turkey still denies an Armenian genocide ever occurred, and many countries still side with Turkey when it claims that the deaths of a million Armenians were merely the result of a variety of World War I skirmishes and Armenian insurgencies impossible to pin on the government. 
Sound familiar? Acknowledging the Armenian 
genocide is still a key world priority as long as there is a Darfur, Rwanda, Kosovo or Cambodia, or any country imprisoning people for their beliefs — particularly students and scholars —  or a terrorist group plotting to annihilate another race, nation or ideology. 
Most Armenian students on 
campus and within the wider local Armenian community hope that with a new president and vice president, both with longstanding records of sup-port for Armenian issues, perhaps the tide will turn, the age-old avoidance of the truth will stop, and official leg-islation acknowledging the Armenian genocide will be signed into law. 
However, between war and the 
economy, these are rather worrisome, distracting times and once again the State Department will likely use the current multiplatform war as its good old excuse to pressure the administra-tion to bypass the Armenian geno-cide issue altogether — as Turkish 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoganrecently attempted to do in his first official dialogue with President BarackObama.
After all, the only remaining super-
power in the world is so darn power-less in the Middle East unless it retains a strategic military base in Turkey, right? Surely the United States is ren-dered useless without one. Our pow-erful nation and military — with two world-war  victories and many oth-
ers under its belt — couldn’t possibly innovate an alternative borne out of a bigger-picture integrity, could they?
Y es, they could.

As a student living the meager col-
lege lifestyle, I find it’s becoming increasingly difficult to actively 
pursue non-resume-filler extracur-riculars. I understand that it’s a natural part of growing up, when immediate responsibilities overtake personal hob-bies, and any notion of rebellion is a pointless diatribe against an otherwise inevitable fate. Even still, knowing this doesn’t make the transition any easier, and conformity has never been very exciting. 
To avoid segueing into a philo-
sophical discussion of our utter mor-tal helplessness, I’ll get to the point: I’m now finding less and less time to absorb myself in the minutiae of video games.
In a culture that defines video-game 
enthusiasts as losers who waste their lives on the couch playing games for the mere love of it, I understand that admitting such a thing could belittle my credibility as a straight-faced gam-ing authority. After all, why would you take me seriously if I couldn’t list the latest gaming trends, regardless of how little they interested me? I would be a fake, and the existence of this column would appear an act of bias. In light of such arguments, I suppose I could just as easily use my trump-all defense — “Go write your own damn column” — but instead, I’ d like to get to the root of the question: What is gaming, and what constitutes a gamer?
Regardless of whether you’re aware 
of it, everyone plays a game of some sort every day. Obviously, none of us really define our ordinary activities as “games, ” per se — but, really, when you’re confronted with an obstacle, a task, an enemy or whatever, and you’re forced to use some semblance of wit and intelligence to overcome it (or, more appropriately, “win it”), then you’re playing a game. By this defini-tion, we’re all gamers stuck within the confines of the most expansive game in the world — life itself.  
Whoa. That’s deep.Art has always been an attempt of 
sorts to comprehend the mysteries of life. But that’s obvious. I mean, aren’t we all, in various ways, trying to make sense of life? If science has always been man’s pursuit of logic, then art, as its antithesis, would naturally be the pur-suit of sometimes-irrational expres-sion. In this quest, however, man has constantly run up against the limits of creativity — his inability to surpass mimicry.
Struggling with creative limitations, 
however, has provided our society with some fascinating results — the best of which is, of course, the art of storytell-ing. Narratives are embedded in the most subtle forms of all art, but story-telling is the most critical in communi-cating life’s complexities and nuances. From novels to comics to films to music, it’s all just an effort to tell a good story, and the most lauded attempts are THE HIGH ART 
OF LIVING

ROONEY Quick — listen to all Rooney’s songs. If not, come sunset, you’ll be denying yourself the kind of 
chest-cavity butterflies one only feels in those precious few cheap, beautiful boy-band moments life brings along. 
Plus, their entire cache of uber-catchy, boom-box-on-the-beach hooks can be devoured in a mere (ecstatic) hour and a half, over two tightly wound full-lengths that’ve already gathered a fair crowd of screaming 13-year-olds.
Can you imagine hearing “The Sweater Song” for the first time live, and not being 
able to sing along? Y eah — so get out your Walkman and Spongebob dance-party under-wear, and get to “I’m Shakin’ , ” guaranteed to make you feel like the star of your very own high-school musical. On the big night, don’t forget to refill your free tub of popcorn right before they play “Popstars, ” then throw the buttery mess all over the masses when Robert Schwartzman screams “Unsophisticated money machines!” like he’ll never warm up to Beverly Hills. Speaking of, he might be stuffing a few butt-white ankle socks in his mouth in the near future, and would be lucky to — I mean, it’s not like Rooney’s gooey Beach Boys imitations are gonna make it in the art circuit.JUSTIN JAMES

the gayest band name ever, but their delayed, love-drunk beats — giddyupped by handclaps and a nasal Casablancas drone — could certainly give you Strokes-style bass pedals to the heart when muffled through the walls of the 52-foot inflatable obstacle course that’ll be killing the Muir lawn. “Hearts break in the corners of eyes” is sung in a round over “It’s all right, it’s OK, you can do what you want” on “Dark Room Cold Air, ” giving us some unsolicited insight into what happens at little-boy sleepovers. But so what if they’ve still got some living to do — so do we. Watch out, face-painting booth.WOLVES
*6<9;,:@ 6-2(;0,*6:;,336Iwas first introduced to Muir College by my 
big sister, who graduated from UCSD in 1988. “Celebrating the independent spirit?” she said, 
pausing on my unofficial college-hunt tour to read the Muir mantra aloud. “I’d say more just celebrat-ing, period. ” Having lived as a jealous Warren prisoner for four torturous years, she made it clear there was only one college to choose from if I was in it for a good time.
This year’s Muirstock bands may have yet to 
find their independence from soundalikes on the college-radio top 40, but all in a row (beginning 3 p.m.), they amount to the perfect party cover band: If you yell loud enough and thrash hard enough, they’ll almost sound like the real thing.Plus, seeing as the Muir activity-fee referendum didn’t pass for next year, we’ll get even crappier bands than Rooney at Muirstock 2010 — so cel-ebrate while you can.

DEVOCEAN Hailing from that road shoulder 
called Temecula you irritating-ly had to speed through to get 
to Coachella, DevOcean can’t really be blamed for setting their MySpace to Comic Sans and masturbating daily to their R.I.P . Brad Nowell posters. And it appears reg-gae’s resident weird uncle — the some-how still alive Eek-A-Mouse (must have been all that medicinal Mary Jane) — sees something special in the little rascals: They opened a Long Beach show of his earlier this month. Well, kids — the only place of residence more stifling than Temecula is your freshman suite, and you won’t find a more opportune soundtrack than DevOcean to hotbox the nerd box, so get to it: Break out your Sublime paraphernalia shoebox and roll a fatty for that fatty you never talk to in the single down the way.

those that affect us emotionally. 
However, among this elite guild 
of storybooks, gaming is probably 
the most invigorating and forward-thinking of its kind. While science and art are natural foes, video games have merged the two to create an entirely unique method of storytell-ing — yin and yang, the techie and muse in perfect harmony!
Compared to existing arts, gam-
ing is admittedly in its infancy. Creators are constantly finding new ways to capitalize on its crack-pipe addicts, but as of yet, we’ve only seen the greenest of beginnings. 
But even in its earliest stages, the 
craft’s genius level of interactivity is undeniable. Other storytelling medi-ums are limited to objectivity; we the audience can see the world, but we can never live in it. What makes video games so fascinating is that they allow us to become part of the art, to manipulate it, to own it. Video games 
tap into a new level of mimicry and response, both exciting and terrifying.
So if art has always mirrored real-
ity, and video games have simply allowed for deeper involvement in this imitation, what makes me any less of an authority than my immedi-ate gaming brethren?  
To be honest, nothing. Video 
games are growing up, and none of us should be confined to labels of gaming or gamers. The question is not, “Will we ever stop playing?” but, “How can we play differently?” 
With games that transcend the 
conventional definition of video gaming — “Flower, ” for instance, depicts the dreams of flowers sit-ting on apartment windowsills — the possibilities seem limitless.  A Gamer’s

TALE OF TWO-STRING PRODIGY HITS ALL THE RIGHT NOTES
*6<9;,:@ 6-<50=,9:(3By Sonia Minden
Hiatus Editor
Skim over its IMDb synopsis and “The Soloist” might read like sentimental Oscar fodder: L.A. Times columnist Steve 
Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is hunting for his next front-page piece when he meets home-less schizophrenic Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who solemnly plays a two-stringed violin next to a gigantic statue of Beethoven. 
Ayers speaks in uncensored babble, wears 
a plastic Hawaiian lei over a sparkly sequined jacket and pushes a shopping cart over-flowing with miscellaneous scraps and garbage bags. But his music — simple and resonant above the constant urban grind — is testament to the transient’s misunder-stood sensitivity and pro-found inner conflict, a time-less grace. 
Yeah, it’s kind of lame 
on paper — but only at brief interludes does “Soloist” actually slip into the realm of red-carpet sap. Whereas most “based on a true story” flicks take loose liberties to heighten drama — tossing characters in merely to provide comic relief or to fill gaps in the storyline — “Soloist” seems to adhere to an unpretty reality. It is not a film about a man’s revelation in his musical genius, or a finding a cure for mental illness that will bring him out of poverty; in fact, most of Lopez’s attempts to relieve Ayers’ ailments are frustratingly ineffective. 
We might guess that a beautiful donated 
cello will be the vagabond’s ultimate salvation — but he refuses to play it indoors, prefer-ring instead the guttered, rat-infested streets. When Lopez gives his friend an opportunity to perform a recital for the public, we might guess that the Juilliard dropout’s prodigious brilliance will attrac t enough mass-media attention to deliver Ayers a professional career and stable lifestyle. Instead, he panics and runs offstage before his bow even hits the strings.
Director Joe Wright’s drama ultimately 
explores a common humanity between two unlikely companions, along with the deeply psychological underpinnings of homelessness. “Why did you drop out of school?” Lopez asks. Ayers shakes his head, his squinted, half-blind eyes darting back and forth. “I don’t know, ” he replies. “It just didn’t work out. ”
Their quiet exchange lets us in on the 
transient’s traumatic, life-consuming dis-
ease: nothing has ever just “worked out” for him. But as we hear the relentless scat-tering of voices distracting Ayers’ thoughts — goading him, threatening him, con-soling him — we hear, too, a sea of music, Ayers’ imagin-ing of symphonic accompa-niment to the low, sad bass 
of his cello. Through his eyes, we see the psy-chedelic colors of synesthesia and flashback glimpses of an increasingly troubled past. 
While Foxx’s performance is as gripping and 
nuanced as in “Ray, ” it’s no pity party. Scenes depicting squatters are nightmarish and border on grotesque, but they’re carefully juxtaposed by Ayers’ unassuming, almost childlike, nature. Lopez handles the grubby street chaos with a cool, appreciative understanding — never demeaning his subjects or shying an occassional sleepover on the sidewalk. 
By the climax, we’re so thoroughly root-
ing for the characters’ success — for Ayers to connect with the outside world and come to terms with his inner demons, for Lopez to write inspired pieces and overcome his own fears and misgivings — that we forgive the occasional waves of tearful orchestral melo-drama in light of the cast’s absorbing relation-ships and restrained, yet intimate, sincerity.

Ximena Sariñana is more than a sexy name — she’s 
got a Berklee diploma, prettier piano fingers than Norah 
Jones and a voice like early Julieta Venegas. Her 2008 album Mediocre is anything but — produced by Tweety Gonzalez of Soda Stereo and Uruguayan singer/songwriter Jorge Drexler, the debut offers an electronica-lifted posy of blissful rock riffs, jazz-pop rhythms and acoustic cool-downs. The former actress has successfully peeled from soapy telenovelas to score a venerable spot on the Latin charts. (SM)HOUSE  OF BLUES / APRIL 26 / $22

■ The Last Kiss
DEF JAM
Five years after The Kiss of Death , Jadakiss has 
risen from the underworld. (Remember No. 
11 single “Put Y a Hands Up”? Didn’t think 
so.) The once-celebrated L.O.X. frontman has been re-upped as a member of the Roc-A-Fella team with the release of his third solo album, and while Jadakiss’ natural flow bleeds of his New Y ork upbringing, cheap ringtone jingles plaster the production — resulting in a hodge-podge of almost-singles.
Jadakiss tries to bridge the gap from street 
rap to club yawns, unsurprisingly tripping over his laces on the way. Disjointed throw-aways “Who’s Real” — complete with the dull, third-grader-could-do-better hook, “If you’re real and you know it, clap your hands” — and “Rockin’ With the Best”  only go skin-deep, not 
flashy enough to warrant the blatant material-ism. 
A lengthy guest list crowds the lineup and amps the schizophrenia. While some draw crowds and deliver (Lil Wayne, Raekwon and Y oung Jeezy), many don’t transcend party-crashing filler (Swizz Beatz, Mary J. Blige). 
The Last Kiss  could have used some of its 
fat cut out, but at a hefty 18 tracks, there’s still enough vintage Jada to keep fans salivat-ing. “Pain and Torture” sees the former Ruff 
Ryder rapping over a minimalist and jagged violin beat, spitting out street-smart, sharp-witted rhymes: “Give it to whoever deserve the rounds/ Hollow tips, move organs and nerves around. ” 
Staying true to his inner-city punk is Jada’s 
best bet at this point, but for such a starry resume (including former Biggie apprentice), this kiss ain’t much wetter than a loveless peck.

Vincent van Gogh suffered an ignoble 
death, dispossessed and paralyzed with 
debt. Despite modern admiration, his Parisian peers couldn’t have been more apathetic. Thankfully, things have changed since then — in “Van Gogh: Brush With Genius” (forgive the title), the post-impressionist superstar is paid tribute with fanfare only IMAX could provide: Sunflowers and sun-flecked fields span both the French countryside and the Fleet Center’s staggering 72 foot screen.

Metric
■ Fantasies
LAST GANG
Above all else, Fantasies  is a tribute to 
Emily Haines’ larynx. Pure and clear, 
rising to a crescendo without faltering 
— effortlessly seductive and transcendent in one great breath — her spot-on vocals elevate Metric’s fourth installment from mellow-rock mediocrity to perfectly chis-eled indie pop.
Haines wrings every last drop of emo-
tion out of simple sentiments that, under the wing of an inferior songstress, might have languished as meaningless. Seemingly trite on the album jacket, lyrics like “I tremble, they’re gonna eat me alive/ If I stumble, they’re gonna eat me alive/ Can you hear my heart beating like a hammer?” break through the electronic haze with sheer, primal power. 
Present only to save her from herself,  
Haines’ cracking beats recall ’80s new wave and polished, airwave-prepped production akin to Garbage or the Talking Heads. On “Satellite Mind, ” drums and guitars fade ignominiously into the background, drown-ing amid the synth waves that escalate Haine’s crystalline high notes.
 Thankfully, Metric avoids near over-sat-
uration on “Gold Guns Girls” and “Stadium Love. ” Crashing drums and slick guitar riffs flesh out the Canadian rockers’ sparkly clean melodies, rocking the party a la 2007’s Grow Up and Blow Away . But everything 
on Fantasies  swings full circle to its heart: 
Haine’s voice, which — even when wavering delicately — rises to a fist-pumping chorus big enough to stuff an amphitheater. 
Metric will perform live in San Diego on 
June 7 at Independence Jam.

Fastball
■ Little White Lies
MEGA FORCE
Trust me on this one: In about a year, you’ll hear Little 
White Lies  in a feel-good Fox Searchlight teen dram-
edy, and damn near nowhere else. Fifteen years after 
dropping surf-rock debut “The Way, ” Fastball’s gone 
softer and sweeter than a pack of Peeps — and swallow-ing all 12 tracks is just about as sickening as gorging on the entire Easter dozen. 
First, two young lovers lock eyes from across the 
room. As the determined buck desperately pushes through the crowd to reach her, Tony Scalzo sighs, “ All I was looking for was you. ” A bouncy, major-key harmony keeps us warm and fuzzy as they smooch for the first time. But like any romantic comedy, its make-out scenes are the only interesting parts, and acoustic guitars and fuzzed-out synths are layered into one big tuned-out soundtrack.
Just then, disaster strikes! Our hero stalks away, his 
tantrum backed by strings plucked with snarky twang, as “Little White Lies” convinces us that he’s better off without her: “I don’t miss you all that much/ Don’t miss your kiss, don’t miss your touch. ” It’s here that Scalzo displays some much-craved restraint, matching crashing drums alongside the only chorus we’ll remember after the credits roll. 
Later, our hero shoves airport security aside and yells 
his lover’s name — with one foot on the plane, she turns, hesitates and runs back to him. A piano chirps out the melody of “Soul Radio”: “Y ou and I, we scream, we cry ... Who knows why we’re here, we’re gone. ” Into the sunset, organs swell and a kid runs his hand down the length of a keyboard — and, suddenly, the final kiss flips from triumphant to cheesy and  overblown.
All the filler between scenes makes us wish for a 
remote control. But most are catchy enough — “Looking For” is a definite high point — that you’ll probably play them more than once, like it or not  (even if you have to sneak into the theater).

■ Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian
WARP
Scott Herren leaves no booklet, no acknowledge-ments and no liner notes to accompany his sixth and most official full-length LP . The Atlanta-based 
hip-hop producer forgoes the big-named cameos that littered his previous works, choosing instead to immerse us in the 29-track Everything She Touched 
Turned Ampexian with no preconceived notions, no judgments and without any clue of what the fuck we’re about to listen to.
But that’s the beauty of Ampexian  — it’s a mind-body 
experience that takes us into the recesses of Herren’s reel-ing dreams and nightmares, channeling laser-sharp emo-tion into an unprecedented artist-audience correlation.
“Periodic Measurements of Infrequent Smiles” spins 
an introduction the length of a goldfish’s attention span. Glitchy speech samples mix with high-frequency, ambient-spaceship static, the white noise seamlessly slipping into a  calm, harmonic chorus before ending up 
right back where it started — all in less than a minute, delivered in cracked-out, animated lurches. 
Herren follows this stream-of-consciousness groove to its bitter end, jumping from blip trip to serene ambi-ence faster and more erratically than Dostoevsky’s Notes from the Underground , restlessly triggering dis-
embodied samples and shattered-glass techno.
Though he unapologetically pushes the boundaries 
of hip-hop further than fellow producers RJD2 and Madlib, Herren can still stick a dance-friendly hook in our heads — no matter how scratched or blurry the lines are. Melodic vibrations infect “Fountains of Spring, ” resonating over a drum track coated in reverb and gravel, and what seems to be a troupe of Martians pushing lawnmowers. 
Careful contemplation and introspection polish off 
Herren’s technique-based tracks, which shine brighter than ever. But, as he intimates with the album title —  
Ampexian  refers  to the old-school Ampex tape decks of 
the 1950s — there’s still room for a little analog spark in all the dense digital smog.

Aztecs in check through the 
remainder of the game, playing even with them and even outscoring the Aztecs in the second quarter. Senior captain Sydney Gstettenbauer played well through the match, scoring four times to provide some hope that UCSD’s key performer will continue her strong play into conference finals this weekend. Despite the early deficit, the Tritons played well through the rest of the match, holding the Aztecs to seven runs — their first-quarter output — throughout the final three periods of the game.
“We’ve been playing together for 
a large part of the year, and we’re finally getting adjusted to each other, ” Heinrich said. “We had a little more experience from the last time we played them. ”
The Tritons also played Chapman 
on Friday and had their greatest offensive production of the season, using a balanced attack to defeat the Panthers by a whopping 20-8 margin. 
Nine Tritons registered goals 
in the game and UCSD scored five goals in each quarter, dominating from start to finish, leading in the match against the Panthers from the get go.
“It was fun playing Chapman, ” 
Heinrich said. “We got to run some stuff we only usually get to run in practice. We definitely got in a lot of good experience for conference championships. ”
In the matchup, Gstettenbauer 
scored seven goals while Heinrich and junior attacker Audra Bloom had solid games as well, each recording hat tricks.
With the season winding down, 
the Tritons must now set their sights on the conference championships this weekend. The Tritons have a 10-19 overall record and, as the No. 4 seed, will face off against fifth-seeded Sonoma State University in the first round of the Western Water Polo Association tournament.
“We’re just getting ready for 
conference, ” head Coach Larry Sanders said. “We’re not worried about who we have to play, we just have to play our game. ”
The Tritons will travel to Santa 
Clara for conference championships on Friday and will play through Sunday for seeding in the NCAA tournament. The winner of the WWPA tournament receives an automatic bid to the national tournament.

UCSD bounced back and took the 
second game 5-0. The Triton offense looked strong in the victory, scoring five runs on 10 hits, including a lead-off home run by sophomore outfielder Kristyn Lesovsky.
“We played very 
well as a team, ” freshman pitcher Camille Gaito said. “I can’t wait to see Kris Lesovsky hit some more home runs. ”
Gaito powered 
the Tritons with a phenomenal performance,  picking up her seventh win of the season in a complete game shutout. Gaito allowed only two Toro hits, and UCSD had a 2-0 lead going into the fifth inning.
Chastain added on to the Triton 
lead with an RBI single. Even with a 4-0 lead, the Tritons continued to hit, loading the bases during the seventh inning. UCSD then scored its final run of the game when CSUDH issued a walk to sophomore catcher Nicole Monroe.
The Tritons fell short in the 
third game, losing 6-3. The Tritons had six hits in the game, but failed to produce with runners on base. UCSD left a total of seven runners stranded.
“Their pitcher came out strong, ” 
Saari said. “We couldn’t string our hits together. ”With the score 6-2 in favor of 
CSUDH, Habib led off the sixth inning with a double, and would come around to score the final run for UCSD later in the inning, courtesy of a Toro error. The Tritons attempted a two-out rally in the final inning when sophomore infielder Sarah Woofter and Saari hit back-to-back singles, but the two never came across to score as the rally failed.
UCSD  
dominated the final game of the series, coming out on top with a 10-2 drubbing of CSUDH. Gaito notched the win for UCSD, her eighth of the season. Gaito tossed 4.2 innings while holding the Toros scoreless. Senior outfielder Allison May put the first runs on the scoreboard with a two-run single to 
right field. May finished the game with two hits. Saari had two hits and two RBI in the victory. The score was 7-2 in favor of UCSD at the start of the seventh inning when Lesovsky officially sealed the victory for UCSD. Lesovsky hammered a three-run homer, adding to her team-high totals in home runs and RBIs this season. She has smashed eight homers and driven in 31 runs for the Tritons so far.
“We did well, ” Monroe said. “Our 
pitchers did an outstanding job and our bats came alive too. I just hope we carry the same attitude and momentum to next weekend. ”

SOFTBALL — UCSD was in desperate 
need of some victories coming into last week’s series against conference rival Cal State Dominguez Hills, having lost four of its last five games. Although the Tritons managed to get a couple wins, they had to settle for a split in their four-game road series.
After the series, UCSD (25-20, 
15-12 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) is tied for fourth place 
in the conference. The Tritons will finish the season by playing a four-game set at Cal State Monterey Bay this weekend. CSUMB (32-23-1, 18-
10 CCAA) is currently second place 
in the California Collegiate Athletic Association. To qualify for the playoffs, UCSD must finish in the top four.
“Now the pressure is on against 
Monterey Bay this weekend, ” junior catcher Nicole Saari said. “We need to get wins no matter what it takes. ”
The first game against CSUDH was 
a pitchers’ duel; UCSD fell short 1-0. Senior pitcher Lauren Chastain tossed a solid game, giving up only six hits in six innings of work. Unfortunately for the Tritons, their offense was almost nonexistent. UCSD only mustered two hits — both singles — against the Toros.

TRACK & FIELD — Even though she had to deal with Los Angeles heat and smog, Bre Schofield stepped up to the line ready to run. By the end of the long 1,500-meter race, she had the fastest women’s time in UCSD history.
“Conditions were pretty bad, ” 
the sophomore said. “I was working on not focusing on it, telling myself it’s not hot. When you race, a lot of things come into your head. But when the gun goes off, I feel more in control. ”
Competing in the Long Beach 
Invitational held at Cerritos College, the Triton track and field team sent a smaller squad in preparation for future races. But, the meet was not without highlights, and Schofield’s record-breaking performance was the most prominent. Schofield set the record with a time of 4:29.67, which is also an automatic NCAA qualifier.
“When I saw it was the fastest 
I’ve ever run the 1,500, I was really excited, ” Schofield said. “Breaking 4:30 has been my goal for the entire year. When I found out I broke the school record it just made it all the better. ”
In the same race, senior Ashleigh 
Montgomory ran a time 4:40.42, good for ninth all-time in school history. Sophomore Deyna Roberson posted a time of 63.69 seconds in the 400-meter hurdles, also good for ninth all-time. In the 100-meter dash, senior Katie Skorupa won her heat with a time of 12.29 seconds, setting a personal record and moving her to fourth all-time. 
On the men’s side, junior Casey 
Ryan placed second in the high jump with a mark of 6’8.75” . Ryan also had a strong showing in the javelin throw, finishing 12th with a distance of 170 feet. 
Schofield was not alone in setting 
school records. Earlier in the week at the Azusa/Mt. San Antonio College Heptathlon, junior Linda Rainwater broke her own school record with a score of 5,140 points. Rainwater was last year’s California Collegiate Athletic Association champion in the heptathlon.
“ A 5,000 point heptathlon for a 
college athlete is pretty exceptional, and she just keeps pouring it on, ” head coach Tony Salerno said. 
Sophomore Stephanie LeFever 
also competed in the event, scoring 4,829 points to earn an automatic NCAA bid. LeFever finished fourth in the conference last season. UCSD is entering the final 
stretch of its season, with the Triton Invitational on April 24 and conference championships a week after that.
“We have a very tough conference, 
one of the toughest in the nation in Division II, ” Salerno said. “We have to be on the ball and maximize points wherever we can. ” 
Schofield also emphasized the 
team aspect heading into conference championships.
“When you get into the 
championship phases, it’s about winning and getting points for your team and working together, ” Schofield said. “We’ve won for the past four years and we have confidence that we can win again. ”
The Tritons will be in action 
this weekend in their final home meet of the season, the Triton Invitational, before the conference championships.

WATER POLO — The Triton women 
ended their regular season against Chapman University on April 17 and squared off against crosstown rival No. 7 San Diego State the next day in their final two games of the year before playoffs. UCSD laid a severe beat down on the Panthers of Chapman, but were overwhelmed by the Aztecs in the same weekend, entering the postseason after yielding mixed results in its final weekend.
The Tritons visited San Diego 
State to take on the team that had beaten them 16-6 earlier in the season at the UC Santa Barbara Invitational Tournament. 
The Tritons entered the annual 
Harper Cup looking for revenge and a chance to exonerate themselves from their earlier loss. As expected, the Aztecs stormed out to a quick lead. But the 7-1 deficit the Tritons were looking at after the first quarter was more than they anticipated.
“They came out strong, ” junior 
hole set Stephanie Heinrich said. “We were expecting them to come out fast, and we just weren’t ready. ”
UCSD managed to hold the
