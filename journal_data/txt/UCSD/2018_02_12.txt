A.S. Counci l is mo difying its
original plan of sellin g generic Plan
B pills in t he A.S. Essentia ls in Geise l 
Library mac hines a fter t he Associate
Universit y Librarian o f Aca demic
Services Cat herine Frie dman denied
the proposa l on Jan. 24. Base d on
an a greement with the Universit y 
Centers Advisory Board, a ‚ÄúWellness 
Vendin g Machine‚Äù will now be placed 
in Price Center t hat contains ot her
items to help promote stu dent health
such as condoms and pre gnanc y 
tests in a ddition to t he emergenc y contracept ive.
In her email to Sixth Colle ge A.S.
Senator Caro line Siege l-Sing h and A.S. 
Associate Vice President of Services an
d Enterprises Ryan Moosig hi 
rejecting their proposal, Friedman
stated  that ‚Äúwhil e we did consider 
your proposa l to a dd Plan B, we feel 
that items available  in this machine 
should  continue to adhe re to the
original intent for having the mac hine
in Geisel.‚Äù
Accor ding to Frie dman, t he
purpose o f the ven ding mac hine was 
primaril y to offer affordable school
supplies.
‚ÄúThe reason we considered [thevending mac hine‚Äôs] p lacement in t he
first place was because we wanted to
support [A.S. Counci l‚Äôs] efforts to o ffer
stude nts convenient access  to standard
academic su pplies at an economical
price, ‚Äù Frie dman wrote .
Siegel-Sin gh, however, hoped
that o ffering the pills in t he Geise l
mach ines would  make them easier to
obtain.
‚ÄúMan y first and second years 
have limite d access to contrace ptive
products because it can be hard to 
find trans portation off cam pus, ‚Äù
Siegel-Sin gh told the UCSD Guardian.Students gathered outside Geisel
Library on T hursday to hold a si lent
demonstration a gainst t he Unite d
States‚Äô failure to reco gnize t he 
Armenian genoci de ‚Äî t he systematic
execut ion of over 1 .5 milli on
Armenians by the Ottoman Empire
and subsequent Tur kish state from
1915 to 1922. Due to t he fact t hat
Turkey, an American a lly, has since
denied that the killings constitute a
genocide and instead ar gue that the
Armenians were enem y com batants, 
the U.S. government has never o fficially 
declared the government‚Äôs actions a 
genoci de.
The group of almost 10 people,
some with duct tape coverin g
their mout hs, stoo d in front o f the
Silent Tree, bearin g red signs wit h
slogans like ‚ÄúStain of Denial‚Äù and 
‚ÄúTOMORROW‚ÄôS INTELLECTUALS 
AGAINST GENOCIDE‚Äù and carr ying 
the Armenian flag. One poster depicte d
a drawin g of Adolf Hitler next to one o f 
the ‚ÄúThree Pashas‚Äù who perpetrated 
the Armenian genoci de an d asked 
‚ÄúWHERE IS OUR RECOGNITION?‚Äù
‚Äî clearly questioning t he government‚Äôs 
acknow ledgement o f the Ho locaust
com pared to its si lence on t he
Armenian genoci de.
Meg Zar garian, a mem ber o f 
UC San Die go‚Äôs Armenian Students
Association, exp lained the ori gins o f 
the genoci de to t he UCSD Guar dian.
‚ÄúSince the y were a Christian 
minorit y durin g [Wor ld War I],
nations starte d leavin g the [Ottoman 
Empire], ‚Äù Zar garian said. ‚Äú[The
Ottomans] decided they wante d to 
keep the land ‚Ä¶ their goal was to
leave one Arm enian and leave him 
in a museum. T hey didn‚Äôt succee d,
but over 1.5 milli on Arm enians were
massac red. ‚Äù
While their demonstration was
only small group, Zargarian noted that the
y were actin g in con junction with
Armenian stu dents across t he countr y.
‚ÄúEvery year, from [the] east to west
coast , Armenians in different sc hools
on this day at the same time protest for 
the Armenian genocide, ‚Äù she stated.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre tr ying to get the hashta g ‚ÄòStain 
of Denia l‚Äô tren ding on socia l media. It‚Äôs
for the Armenian genocide and to get
recognition on t he day of Apri l 24 [t he 
day the Armenian genoci de began]. ‚Äù
Sixth Colle ge student Albert
Danie lyan believes t hat because t he
genoci de was one o f the first mo dern
ethnic c leansings, it is important t hat
the event be remem bered accurate ly.
‚ÄúDespite the fact that other historical

Friedman went on to propose Price
Center East as an a lternative location 
for A.S. Counci l to se ll the Plan B pills,
which is w here UCAB has agree d forthe ven ding mac hine to be insta lled.
The mac hine wi ll be in operation
24 hours per day, even w hen Price 
Center itse lf is closed, and will likely be
put in sometime this quarter. 
As ori ginally p l a n n e d ,  t h e  P l a n  B
pills will be sold at a reduced price o f 
around $20, made more affordable b y 
the fact that the pills are the generic
version and can only be bought with
Triton Cash. According to CBS8, the 
cost of the vending machine itself is being finance d by both the stu dent 
activity fee an d funding from t he office
of Assistant Vice Chance llor of Student
Wellness Karen Calfas.  
The installat ion of the Wellness
Vending Mac hine wi ll make UC San

Guardian. ‚ÄúIt was one of the first signs
of systematic c leansin g, and I feel that
it should be reco gnized so we can have
our voices heard. ‚Äù
At past years‚Äô demonstrations,
students have also hi ghlighted the
University of California‚Äôs financial ties 
to the Republic of Turkey, particularly 
its over $70 mi llion in investments , and called  for divestment. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still in the works, but we‚Äôre
going to present a divestment from
the Republic of Turke y,‚Äù  E a r l  Wa r r e n
College graduate Seda Byurat said in2016. ‚ÄúThis resolution 
passed across
many U C campuses ‚Äî U CLA, UC
Berkeley, UC Irvine, UC Riversi de,
just to name a few. Fina lly, it‚Äôs comin g
here to UCSD. T his is our se gue into
bringing up divestment. Even Hit ler
quoted, ‚ÄòWho, after all, remembers

to get away with his Holocaust. I f we keep these huge historical things

West Con ference wit h open arms. S hortly after t he up date
was announce d, the news quic kly made its wa y through the stu dent
body ‚Äî even appearin g on t he Face book meme pa ge ‚Äî an d UCSD
sports has ex perienced a sudden buzz of interest .
Beginnin g with a student-initiated petition ‚Äî with around 8,828
students si gning it ‚Äî UCSD began its journe y to Division I in
2016. T his petition represente d a 70-percent approva l rate for the
move and onl y gained momentum from there. After the petition,
a referendum was held in which facult y members were given the
chance to vote on t he move. T his once a gain passe d wit h flying
colors. On top o f this, the Big West Con ference had been expressin g
an interest in taking UCSD ‚Äúunder its wing‚Äù for the past few years
(despite some sli ght complications with initiall y rejectin g us).
Ever ythin g seemed to work out perfectl y.
However, despite the promise that Division I brin gs, UCSD
still remains a Divi sion-II school  until its new status  takes  effect
in 2020. For UCSD sports, t he Division-II status has held its fair 
share o f disappointments,
often conjuring up a
lackluster sense o f apat hy.
Bein g Division II means
that UCSD‚Äôs riva ls are o ften
sma ller sc hools (avera ging
aroun d 4,000 to 6 ,000
students ) wit h a different
emphasis on aca demic
stan dards an d share little in
common with our student 
population. At the same
time , UCSD‚Äôs muted focus
on s ports has fed into t he
school‚Äôs reputation as being
‚ÄúUC Sociall y Dead. ‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care enou gh
about this school. I don‚Äôtcare enou
gh about our sports 
league, ‚Äù an anon ymous
Roger Reve lle sop homore
commented. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know that much about our sports league.
I think a big factor t hat plays into it is t hat we don‚Äôt have any riva ls
to reall y pit ourselves a gainst and we‚Äôre kind of just there. We‚Äôre not
the best, we‚Äôre not t he worst, an d there‚Äôs not hing that we rea lly strive
for.‚Äù
So, wou ld the move into Division I rea lly make all that big of a 
difference? Ear l Edwards, the director o f athletics , seems to t hink so.
He claims that with UCSD‚Äôs entrance into the Bi g West Conference, 
there wi ll be a reviva l in communit y between UCSD‚Äôs divided
campus. T his is because UCSD wi ll be able to compete a gainst
schools suc h as UC Irvine, UC Davis, Ca lifornia State Universit y 
Fullerton, an d California Po lytechnic State Universit y San Luis
Obis po ‚Äî  schools that are much closer to home than UCSD‚Äôs
current Division-II opponents. The new status will also brin g about
more nationa l recognition an d greater me dia attention to UCSD as
a whole.  
‚ÄúThe main wa y [becomin g Division I] will affect our campus is
throug h the school pride an d uni fication [it wi ll bring], ‚Äù E dwards
said. ‚ÄúFor athletics, there will be more national ex posure for UC San
Diego, which will help people gain better jobs. UCSD will also get
more ex posure an d media attention. T hat is better for the stu dents, if we get more reco gnition as a whole. When you travel to east of the 
Mississippi, a lot of people don‚Äôt reall y know about UCSD. But we
are basica lly a pu blic iv y league, an d this [move into Division I] can
be our wa y of communicatin g that stor y across t he nation. ‚Äù
This ver y sense of excitement is one that Frida y‚Äôs Spirit Ni ght
tried to facilitate. Wit h vibrant blues an d golds havin g consume d the
usua lly still RIMAC gym, an d the crow ds havin g roare d with cheer, 
Spirit Ni ght claime d to be the one ni ght where Tritons were a ble to
‚Äúlet loose‚Äù their school pride. It is exactl y this that Earl Edwards and
several other facult y members and students are lookin g forward to.
With the move into Division I wi ll hopefully come t he approac h of 
more ni ghts suc h as these.
On t he other en d of the spectrum, however, UCSD‚Äôs move into
Division-I status doesn‚Äôt come entirel y without consequences. In
fact, part of the reason wh y Division I won‚Äôt come into effect until
2020 is the pa yment plan that UCSD must adhere to. Accordin g to
the San Die go Union-Tri bune, t he Interco llegiate At hletic fee that
students had previous ly pai d quarter ly was $129.38 per quarter.
With the move into Division I, t his num ber has changed to $239.38
per quarter, t hus raising costs by 
around $480 per academic year
(excluding summer session). This
e in the cost of attendance can‚Äôt
lp but beg the question: Is t he 
p‚Äù in school spirit worth it?
Man y seem to t hink not. 
Moving into Division I wouldn‚Äôt 
ally change muc h. If anyt hing, it 
ould increase our tuition because
the necessar y spen ding nee ded 
move into Division I , and the
ansportation, an d the scoutin g
d all that, ‚Äù an anon ymous
udent stated. ‚ÄúI also think [the 
mes] wou ld be rea lly slow at t he
ginnin g and the pa yoff wouldn‚Äôt
ally happen until ma ybe two to
ve years down the line [when 
e get better]. As o f now, I don‚Äôt
ally go to t he games. So w hat‚Äôs
going to cause me to go to a game against Stanford? Just because it‚Äôs
Stan ford? No, it‚Äôs not going to ma ke that muc h of a difference w ho
we pla y against. Sports just aren‚Äôt that bi g at UCSD. Let‚Äôs be honest. ‚Äù
Not a ll stu dents feel this wa y, however. Current mem bers o f 
various UCSD sports teams are a lso frustrate d by the fact t hat
Division I wou ld not a ffect our current s ports. As Aaron Kim, a
sophomore on the men‚Äôs baseball team, stated, ‚ÄúAs a team we have
a little frustration toward the 2021 status  ‚Ä¶ but all we can do is
shape the pro gram more and prepare it for the future pla yers of the 
program. ‚Äù
Yet despite t hese views, it is important to note t hat the move to
Division I is a c hoice ma de by the stu dent body. It is t he promise t hat
the future brin gs that gets at the heart of what a Division-I status
can do. Although current students may not be able to reap all of the
benefits of a new status, the move will at least o pen UCSD u p to
newer, an d hopefully better, opportunities.The issue of UCSD‚Äôs 
move to Division I still faces polarized views from the students. With the time and money that it will take, are we making the right decision?

BL: Any favorite love story you‚Äôve heard or experienced yourself you‚Äô d like 
to share?
AO : I think my favorite love story that I‚Äôve heard is my grandparents‚Äô . We 
were on the plane to Barcelona, and I think it was maybe the third or fourth 
hour of the flight. My grandma and I were the only ones awake, and we somehow got on the topic of how she met my grandpa. It turns out he was the best friend of my grandma‚Äôs older brother, but growing up, they weren‚Äôt interested in dating each other. My grandma used to say that he was like a brother to her, and he was even the one that chaperoned her dates with other guys. My grandma went to school in Barcelona for a couple years, and my grandpa was her most constant letter writer. Over the years, they developed feelings for each other, and they got married in her last year of college.
BL: What ‚Äúlove lesson, ‚Äù for lack of a better phrase, do you think you‚Äôve 
gained from watching your grandparents interact?
AO : I think it has to be the concept of your significant other being your 
best friend. For me, at least, I can‚Äôt separate the two, and I would feel like my partner would need to know me completely in order for the relationship to work. My grandparents know every possible detail about the other, and you can even see that, as well as the amount of love they have for each other, today. What I‚Äôve seen in less successful relationships is that sometimes you rush into love right away, and you don‚Äôt give each other time to build a friendship, so you don‚Äôt have that foundation to fall back on when the time comes. How about you, in terms of what you‚Äôve seen or even experienced yourself?
BL: I think something I learned from watching people in my life is how 
to love someone sacrificially, romantic or otherwise. A lot of relationships I watched growing up were built upon action-oriented love. I have an aunt who would never respond to my uncle when he said ‚ÄúI love you, ‚Äù but she would always know what kinds of food he liked, when he was out of water or tea, and is overall very observant in showing this more silent kind of love. Granted, this might be a cultural response to my White-American uncle, Asian-American aunt dynamic. But I feel like that cultural understanding of love through service and in sacrificing bits of self, coupled with my faith, plays a big role in how I hope to love people sacrificially too. 
AO : I can resonate a lot with what you said about culture shaping the way 
you approach love, but I feel like I never got to fully experience that since my parents weren‚Äôt together for a lot of my life, and I didn‚Äôt really get to see first-hand what love was. My definition of love was very much created from the things I read or watched on TV because I never saw romantic love directly. BL: What were the formative pieces of media or books that shaped your 
perspective of love? And do you feel like what you experienced personally aligned with the things you saw or read?
AO : When I was 12 or so, I was obsessed with ‚ÄúFull House‚Äù ‚Äî had all the 
seasons on DVD, would rejoice when the reruns were on Nick at Nite ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt truly realize why until high school. In the Philippines, sometimes divorce is associated with the concept of a broken family, but ‚ÄúFull House‚Äù was the first show I saw that didn‚Äôt feature a complete family but also wasn‚Äôt broken. Obviously, it‚Äôs not really the same thing because, in the show, the mom passed away, but I really connected with the concept of living with a single parent. Getting to see a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù family, if you will, represented on TV was pivotal in my understanding of what love meant.
BL: I appreciate the sentiment you bring up that almost reclaims what it 
means to have a holistic family or love; that in normative ways, something might look broken, but in reality, it is still very much whole in how the situation or experience is actualized. 
AO : Do you feel like the culture of showing love within your family made it 
a challenge to understand what love was, at least early on?
BL: I think what I was able to observe wasn‚Äôt necessarily a challenge to how I 
understood love because it was ingrained and internalized so much as to what love was. But I do think it is a challenge now as I am learning more about how to love other people well. So for instance, with my family using service as the primary form of love, it is challenging to step out of my comfort zone to give, for instance, verbal affirmation or physical displays of affection. Like for the longest time, hugging was so unnatural for me! Long story short, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate a good hug and find a pat on the shoulder as something very comforting. Anyways, tying it back to how I see love as a sacrificial gift we can offer, it‚Äôs as if sacrificing my comfort in silence and service and offering something, like words or a hug, is my way to try and meet someone in how they comprehend and see love. 
AO : We bring two really different perspectives of how we came to 
understand love, which is very eye-opening. We have this assumption that love is universal, but in many ways it‚Äôs not. I think remembering that people will not come from the same background of showing or feeling love as you do is important when you start out any sort of relationship. 
BL: It‚Äôs as if communicating about how we love is just as important as 
communicating the love itself. Lifestyle Living Room: Love in Translation

Most love stories in toda y‚Äôs media are either cliche roman ce novel plots or oversexualized
views o f millennia l hook-up cu lture. I persona lly never re lated to eit her o f these simp lified
depictions o f love an d lust because I never rea lly experience d them. T he kind of love I
experience d was t he con fusing, innocent kind. Few peop le tell the story o f their c hildhood
crush, but this Valentine‚Äôs Da y you‚Äôre in for a treat. So hop into m y DeLorean and grab some
Silly Ban dz; I‚Äôm ta king us back to 2009 to remin d you o f childhood love.
Picture t his: a nine-year-o ld girl with Frenc h braids wa king up to a new dawn. S he‚Äôs scare d
but excited to start over at a new school. A new school means new friends and a chance toreinvent 
herself. This girl eagerly puts on her dark blue uni form an d steps on t he bus hopin g for
a fresh start. As s he wa lks into her fourt h-grade classroom, s he is su ddenly overw helmed with
a wave of anxiet y and is havin g second thou ghts. She takes her seat and turns around, onl y to
be con fronte d by some new c lassmates. As s he nervous ly starts to intro duce herself, she grows
accustomed to her status as the ‚Äúnew girl. ‚Äù And just when she thou ght she had seen it all, she
catches a glimpse of him: the bo y whose name would forever haunt her heart .
For t he sake of anon ymity and what‚Äôs left of my dignity we are going to re fer to t his guy as
‚ÄúMike Wazowski, ‚Äù a weird inside joke we shared. An yway, I met Mike outside on the pla yground
after the buzz of being the new girl wore off. He came right up to me, smiled, and like most
nine-year-o ld boys, ma de a fart soun d with his armpit. As you mi ght expect, I s hrieked and
ran awa y from him, but m y fearless suitor insiste d on courtin g me wit h his won derful musica l
talents. It turned out that Mike and I made quite the pair, and I always thought of him as a
close friend.
Then pu berty happene d, comp licatin g things because Mi ke starte d actin g weir d. As we grew 
older, Mi ke starte d to hang out wit h his ot her friends, but on t he rare occasions w hen he did
talk to me, it wou ld always be brief and awkward, like he was tr ying to be two different peop le
at once. One side of him would act like a stereot ypical ‚Äúbro‚Äù but the other would be the dork y sweet heart w ho tau ght me how to cross m y eyes. I never un derstoo d why he acte d this wa y unti l
one da y when I missed the bus he told me, ‚ÄúI missed you, yesterda y. Who else am I supposed
to make lau gh on the wa y home?‚Äù Ma ybe it was the hormones kickin g in that gave m y stomach
butter flies. Ma ybe it was t he dim lighting and Axe body spra y seepin g out t he boys‚Äô bathroom
that was ma king my head spin. But as he wa lked awa y, it finally occurre d to me: Mi ke Wazows ki
had a crush on me , and I liked him too .
At first, I panic ked because t his was a crisis t hat re quired a w hole squad. But t he pro blem
was I didn‚Äôt have a squa d yet; I on ly had Mike and anot her girl. But I knew i f I told this ot her girl
she wou ld tell the whole class. Luc kily, I had a backup p lan: t he internet. Now i f you ever looked
up datin g advice on the internet, you probabl y left more confused than when you started. So
we spent t he rest o f middle school sharing awkward but lovin g glances, w hile simu ltaneous ly 
growing further apart because of the walls we built up to create a friend zone .
Now I am full y aware of how awkward this childhood crush is, but ever y once in a while, I
can‚Äôt help but think to m yself if Mike was t he one t hat got awa y. Although we went to different
schools, I wou ld occasiona lly see him at t he ma ll, and durin g one ver y pain fully awkward
Costco trip (there is nothing worse than watching your mom bond with your crush‚Äôs mom over
a deal on rotisserie). A lthough I use d to scro ll through his Face book in high school, I soon
realized that I was simp ly infatuate d with the idea of him. It happens to a ll young lovin g hearts,
but at one point one must learn to let go of what never happened. So eventuall y I did move on
to better an d taller guys just as he found love e lsewhere. But you never rea lly forget that first
love. I te ll you this em barrassin g, bittersweet memor y to remin d you o f the beauti ful, innocent
love that we all deserve to experience at one point in life. And to Mike Wazowski, if b y some
embarrassin g and seren dipitous grace o f God you are rea ding this: T hank you for being my first
love an d openin g my heart up to a wor ld of new emotions t hat I am sti ll learnin g to navi gate. 

Welcome back to a love y-dove y, cupid-struck horoscope, Astro-lovers. New and excitin g
things are in store for all of the si gns this week, so make sure to check your horoscope ‚Äî and
maybe your crus h‚Äôs, too !
Aries :
This Valentine‚Äôs Da y could lead to the desire for a relationship, causin g some ne gative
feelin gs, but don‚Äôt let the season dra g you down. The stron g, independent attitude of an Aries
has to be appreciate d by a specia l type o f person. Do not sett le for an ything less.
Taurus :
Taurus ‚Äî so coo l, calm, an d collected ‚Äî t his Va lentine‚Äôs Da y frenz y is going right past you;
however, it‚Äôs alwa ys fun to celebrate. Get some friends to gether, eat some cand y, write corn y 
cards, and make chocolate covered strawberries. Mmm, yum!
Gemini :
Gemini, not hing gets you more intereste d than an intricate min d. Go to t he histor y museum,
observator y, or science center, an d spar k a fiery conversation wit h someone. Hope fully their
intellect matches your own and leads to somethin g wonderful .
Cancer :
A day an d nig ht in rea lly satis fies your nee ds, Cancer. Spen d time wit h your signi ficant
other or some good friends and coo k a grand mea l: appetizer, main dish, sides, desserts, an d all.
Indul ge and treat each other to a calm, deli ghtful time .
Leo:
Get flashy this Va lentine‚Äôs Da y, Leo. Y es, a bsolutely wear t hat re d dress, wit h those re d shoes,
and that re d lipstic k. Get festive an d make bold moves. A lso, remem ber to pic k up on t he vibes
your crus h is definite ly sending and even sen d some back!
Virgo:
Virgo, you are a lways so cau ght up in t he details, but this Va lentine‚Äôs Da y, ditch the plan!
Technica lities are not as important as t hey seem. Let t hings flow natura lly, and see w hat the
universe has in store. Get brunc h and then do whatever comes to min d.Libra:
With the moon in Libra, your inner, more secretive personalit y traits will become more
obvious. Ever yone wi ll know a bout how lovin g, kind, and cheesy you are, an d they‚Äôll love it, too.
Be open to anyt hing t his Va lentine‚Äôs season, but ma ke time for se lf-love!
Scorpio:
As the most sensual of the si gns, Scorpio, yo u  w i l l  b e  v e r y in-tune with your desires;
however, do not get swept awa y. Keep goals in min d and have friends help. Goo d friends can be
more power ful than an y motivationa l speec h.
Sagittarius :
Sagittarius, you ma y feel as if this Valentine‚Äôs Da y season is an attack on your sin gle self, but
do not take it personall y. It is merel y an idea with no true value. No one can love you the wa y 
you can. Use Va lentine‚Äôs Da y as a day to simp ly live an d love.
Capricorn :
Usually so focuse d on wor k, you are o ften c losed off to love, Capricorn. Open your heart 
up to meetin g a special someone or some new friends! Bein g alone does not equate to bein g
efficient. A llow ot hers to help, and be sur prised at w hat can be accom plished.
Aquarius :
As it is Aquarius season, you are at your stron gest. Ta ke advanta ge of this. Wit h con fidence,
anythin g is possible, even catchin g the e ye of that cutie in chemistr y. Put yourself out there,

// Contributin g Writer: THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , FEBRUARY 12, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.OR G
Guardian: Aman da, w hy did you
decide to stud y media at UC San
Diego?
Aman da Cataro ja: I decided to stu dy media
here because I rea lly like that the program is
diverse. Not onl y is it film and media, you also
get to do fine art as we ll, which I rea lly like
because I a lso do illustration an d paintin g along 
with animation and film . 
G: Y our short films cover a ver y wide 
field, ran ging from t he surrea l t o  a n  a lmost
documentarian feel ‚Äî w hich met hod is your
preferred filmin g style?
AC: That‚Äôs a tou gh one. I guess I can sa y that I
do prefer the more satirical, li ghthearted works, 
even t hough my fourth film was very kind
of dark humor , it sti ll had a sense o f humor
in there. I alwa ys incorporate some sort o f 
humorous aspect, be it visua l or script-writin g
wise. 
G:Why do you feel the nee d to inc lude humor ?
AC: I feel that humor is one o f the most 
accessi ble wa ys to conve y some sort o f messa ge,
or to conve y some sort of critique. Especiall y 
even i f it was wit h a harsh subject. For examp le,
my fourth film was called ‚ÄúMy Ass is Bleedin g
2,‚Äù  a nd at the end of it there was a messa ge about
the issues wit h healthcare in t he Unite d States , 
which is a reall y hard topic to discuss ‚Ä¶ I alwa ys 
thought that conve ying some sort o f messa ge
in re gards to socia l issues, to po litical issues, to
things that affect peop le‚Äôs lives ‚Äî t he best wa y 
to have t hat trans ferred out is t hrough humor.
Peop le pay attention to t hat ‚Ä¶ w hen there‚Äôs a
sense o f humor invo lved, they remem ber it.
G:Do you want to e laborate on an y overarc hing 
themes or messa ges in your works ?
AC: My wor k is usua lly satirica l ‚Ä¶ I ten d to do
a lot of wor ks that invo lve not necessari ly full-
blown po litical issues but things that just a ffect 
people socia lly. So t hat one was on healthcare,
my other one was a small one on people
gossipin g and being mean an d derivin g pleasure 
from people‚Äôs misfortune. ‚Ä¶ Then m y cartoons,
that has a lot of gay themes, an d it approac hes
queer issues t hrough a lighthearte d cartoon wa y.
G:What does t he directin g and filming process 
look like for you?
AC: It‚Äôs ver y structured, actuall y. I‚Äôm a ver y 
structure d artist; I usua lly start o ff by writing a 
bunch of notes. ‚Ä¶ T hen, if I have anot her film
that‚Äôs inspirin g me in min d, I wi ll sit down an d
watc h that film an d analyze how it‚Äôs s hot, how 
it‚Äôs written, how its scri pt functions within the 
film, an d incorporate t hat into m y later wor ks. 
After that I write t he script, w hich depen ding on
how much I don‚Äôt have writer‚Äôs block , I‚Äôll either
knock it out fast or knock it out in a long time.
Afterwar d, I‚Äôll start ta lking about it wit h my 
friends ‚Äî m y friends are usua lly the peop le who 
are feature d in my wor ks ‚Äî an d I start a p lan, 
and then we start shootin g. On set all the shots
are p lanne d, I always set up t he audio an d the 
lights. It‚Äôs just ver y structure d. I wor k on strict
dead lines and schedules.
G: Y ou mentione d your friends, so how 
collaborative is your wor k?  I s  i t  m o r e  o f an 
independent process or is it activel y involvin g
a lot of different actors an d friends from your
communit y?
AC:  It is ver y collaborative, actuall y. It‚Äôs
surprisin g because I a lways joke that I‚Äôm a
contro l freak with my wor k, but in fact, no, I
actua lly ver y muc h welcome co llaboration. I 
guess m y idea is t he main one, so t hat‚Äôs usua lly 
spearheaded, but if a friend or somebod y who 
I‚Äôm wor king wit h suggests a won derful idea that 
I just cannot i gnore, I wi ll always incorporate
it. I love w hen people come u p with won derful 
ideas because t hey get rea lly into it. It‚Äôs just a
wonderful process. I love this collective of great
ideas just coming into fruition in one art piece. 
G:Can you descri be the stu dent communit y 
within the me dia department ?
AC: I will admit I can‚Äôt reall y discuss a lot
because I‚Äôm so new here ‚Ä¶ but I will sa y 
that ever yone is so motivated with the media 
major ‚Ä¶ everyone is so passionate a bout t heir
work. Ever yone is just so open to sharin g ideas
and the one t hing I do like is t hat w hen iscomes to technical stuff since the media ma jor
is definite ly muc h more conceptua l, a lot o f 
students are wi lling to s hare t heir tec hniques
in re gard to filming things tec hnically, and I
find that very won derful. An d we have a lot
of wonderful and interestin g perspectives and
ideas comin g along; I‚Äôll see pieces t hat are
feminist wor ks, I see pieces t hat deal with the 
experience of bein g an international student,
and then I‚Äôve seen some rea lly funny ones ‚Ä¶ I
just see a lot of interestin g wor k, and I rea lly like
that ever yone is just so passionate about what
they do. Y ou can just feel it.      
G:Based off of your experiences so far as a
trans fer stu dent, how do you feel like the visua l
arts and media center is different at UC San
Diego versus t he universit y as a w hole? We are 
largely STEM an d researc h based, so w here do
you feel that the niche is with media and visual 
arts?    
AC: Well the one t hing I wi ll say is that the 
media ma jors ‚Äî it‚Äôs so sma ll, I‚Äôm startin g to
realize t his already ‚Äî we know eac h other
like vampires. We‚Äôre just this small collective
of artists, an d I find that rea lly interestin g. I
will admit because I‚Äôm usua lly in Man deville
or the Media and Communications buildin g,
I haven‚Äôt rea lly run into a lot of STEM majors,
it‚Äôs a lmost like a microcosm ‚Ä¶ Ever yone‚Äôs so
m o t i v a t e d ;  w e  k i n d  o f  a l l  k n o w  e a c h  o t h e r .  I  
think that‚Äôs interestin g that UCSD is primari ly 
known for STEM, when in realit y we have such
a ric h art histor y department ‚Ä¶ I do feel that 
this art department is fantastic ‚Ä¶ I do wis h that
more people knew about it. I feel like it‚Äôs kind
of like a secret gem t hat we have out here. ‚Ä¶ 
The one thin g that‚Äôs reall y nice about our art
program here, an d why I was ver y intereste d
in them, is t hat it‚Äôs inter discip linary. All of the
art departments ta lk to eac h other, it‚Äôs not just 
singled out like wit h some universities ... w hich
I find won derful because, as an inter discip linary 
artist, that reall y is beneficial to m y growth and 
my education.          
G:I cou ldn‚Äôt help but notice t here are a cou ple 
of your paintin gs in the back grounds of some
of the clips yo u  s e n t  m e  ‚Äî  how muc h do
you com bine your visua l arts wit h your more 
filmma king style?
AC:  They almost go hand in hand. The one
thing I did forgot to mention ‚Ä¶ w hen it comes 
to preppin g for film wor k ‚Äî I do a lot o f 
storyboards. In fact, I ma ke animatics o f my 
films before I actuall y start shootin g if time
permits me. ‚Ä¶ The thin g that‚Äôs interestin g is
with the visua l arts an d fine art in m y paintin gs 
and illustrations, it‚Äôs just stationar y, it‚Äôs still.
Whereas w hen I see film, it‚Äôs kind of like a
movement version o f that; peop le actin g out 
your drawin gs. ‚Ä¶ Sometimes, because I ten d 
to paint co lorful wor ks, an d I have co lorful
videos, I incorporate some of m y paintin gs in
there if they matc h the color sc heme. ‚Ä¶ I t hink 
there‚Äôs a stron g connection between drawin g
and paintin g and film and cartoon ‚Äî the y‚Äôre all
a visual medium.         
G:What do you consi der your sty le of painting 
to be? Or does it var y from topic to topic ?
AC:  Pro bably satirica l pop art. T he one t hing
that is consistent throu ghout all m y work is
there‚Äôs a lways a sense o f humor. T here‚Äôs a lways
satirical work. ‚Ä¶ I do a lot of satirical pop art; I 
painte d Pepe before he became racist, w hich is a 
shame because t hat was suc h a goo d meme. It‚Äôs
just kind of reflections of thin gs that are popular, 
and then wit h just a s light little humorous touc h. 
G:Do you base your commentar y off of what 
you feel i s  m o s t  r e levant or do you have an y 
main sources o f inspiration ?
AC: I wou ld say that‚Äôs a com bination o f both. 
Relevanc y is pro bably a big one for me, w hen
I was working on ‚ÄúMy Ass is Bleeding 2‚Äù there
was a healthcare commentar y, and I was doin g
that during t he time t here was a lot of discourse
was going on the Affordable Care Act and a
lot of the backlash that it was gettin g. It just so
happens t hat at t he time t hat starte d coming
up, and when I released it into film festivals, 
that was a main commentar y so it did well 
with the film festiva ls because it was just soprevalent. When I was workin g on paintin gs,
like when I did that Pepe paintin g ‚Ä¶ Pepe was 
the bi ggest meme. And I thou ght, ‚ÄúOh, let‚Äôs do
a little homa ge to this, ‚Äù I thou gh t i t ‚Äô d be funn y 
because ever yone sees Pepe, so I was t hinking,
‚ÄúWhat if I m ade him fin e art?‚Äù Lik e museu m 
fine art, like per fectly blended, proportions are
right but sti ll looks like Pepe, so I did that one. 
‚Ä¶ Now another thin g, just outside, inspiration -
wise, I‚Äô d be inspired b y a lot of movies and
cartoons. When I was doin g ‚ÄúSpillin g Tea‚Äù ‚Ä¶
I was inspired b y ‚ÄúClueless, ‚Äù ‚ÄúMean Girls, ‚Äù and 
Frank Zappa‚Äôs ‚ÄúValle y Girl‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I get inspiration
from ever ywhere. M y joke is t hat I stea l from
everyone an d ever ything as an artist .
G: Y ou mentioned film festivals, can you
elaborate more on t hat? W hat are you doing to
make yourse lf known ?
AC:  I have a Facebook pa ge, ‚ÄúHouse 27, ‚Äù that‚Äôs 
my movie compan y at [t his] time. Hope fully 
it‚Äôll become rea l in t he future , and what I do
is: I have a FilmFreewa y account, I upload m y 
videos onto Fi lmFreewa y, and I distribute m y 
film to t he festiva ls I feel wou ld fit my movie. 
I‚Äôve su bmitte d to t his place ca lled Bad Film 
Fest I‚Äôve su bmitte d to W hoops Film Festiva l,
I‚Äôve submitted to a bunch of the alternative ,
undergroun d film festiva ls. An d it‚Äôs just a ll vira l,
you share it, an d then you have to wait for a long
time to find out whether your work is accepted 
or not acce pted. I was acce pted to severa l film 
festiva ls, an d through that they used a lot of my 
work for promotiona l stuff, so I wou ld kind of 
just s hare it on line. ‚Ä¶ Ever ything‚Äôs on line now. 
G: Do you feel that it‚Äôs kind of difficult being so
young and trying to become known, or do you
feel like that your classes and just bein g tuned
into the internet has allowed you to share your
work?
AC: I will admit the internet has made thin gs 
a lot easier for not onl y just me, but artists 
in genera l. I wou ld not know how to su bmit
my work to film festivals had there not been
some sort o f online source, or sa y if this were
the ‚Äò90s, I would not know where to start ‚Ä¶
With FilmFreewa y and other p latforms like
it, they‚Äôve ma de it a lot more accessi ble, an d I
really feel that it‚Äôs helped a lot. T he one t hing I
guess is hard promotion-wise is ‚Äî you know I 
have outsi de obligations, tr ying to pursue m y 
education and get m y degree. That‚Äôs not a bad
hindrance, it‚Äôs just priorities o f course. So I
would just sa y I support t he internet a ll the wa y 
through. It does have its pro blems, I wi ll admit
that film festiva ls online ten d to be scams. ‚Ä¶ I
think another thin g that I personall y stru ggle
with i s  t o  p r o p e r ly promote yourse lf on t he
internet; you have to be on t he internet a ll the 
time. ‚Ä¶ I would have never been able to have
the opportunities I‚Äôve had, I never wou ld have
been able to send m y w o r k  o u t  t o  a l l  o f  t h e s e
festiva ls, across t he nation ‚Äî I never wou ld have 
done t hat, I wou ld have been strict ly Ca lifornia .
G: Do you have an y final comments, su ggestions,
or inf ormation for fellow m edia stude nts or 
people intereste d in the arts department at UC
San Die go at all ?
For t he arts department, t he most c liche one
is ‚Äî don‚Äôt ever be discourage d. Don‚Äôt ever be
discoura ged, don‚Äôt ever feel like you have to 
pursue somet hing e lse for income, for pleasin g
your parents, and what-not. Cause there are a 
lot of opportunities for art. ‚Ä¶ Anot her thing
I wou ld say is don‚Äôt let fear dictate your pat h 
in re gard to art-makin g. Art-makin g is alwa ys
going to be a frustratin g process. ‚Ä¶ T here‚Äôs
never an easy way to get from your s ketch to
a final piece. Just keep on going, an d practice
makes per fect. 
In the future, Aman da hopes to ma ke feature 
length films an d have an animate d series. For

The first season o f ‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù ends
on a ma jor spoiler. I f you have not completed it,
please read no further !
Welcome! Ever ything is fine. Suc h are t he 
words that not on ly greet eac h new resi dent o f 
the Goo d Place, but also ever yone w ho‚Äôs about to
watc h a TV come dy that pu lls off more surprises
than you can count. A fter a critica lly acclaime d
premiere season, ‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù brin gs bac k 
all the elements that made it a success  in the
first place: lovable characters, c lever humor, an d 
a loophole that rep laces swearin g with innocent
words like ‚Äúfork‚Äù and ‚Äúshirt. ‚Äù But as it proved in
the first season, nothin g is quite as it seems in
‚ÄúThe Good Place. ‚Äù With so man y plot twists and
misdirections, season two firmly esta blishes
‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù as one of the smartest and
most creative comedies on television.
Created b y Michael Schur (‚ÄúParks and
Recreation‚Äù ), ‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù follows Eleanor 
Shellstrop (Kristen Be ll) after s he wa kes up
in the Goo d Place, a utopian nei ghborhooddesigned b y an immortal bein g named
Michael (Ted Danson ). There, Eleanor finds
herself in t he compan y of her sou lmate C hidi
Anagonye (Wi lliam Jac kson Harper), Britis h
socia lite Ta hani A l-Jami l (Jamee la Jami l), silent
Buddhist mon k Jianyu (Manny Jacinto), an d
informationa l assistant Janet (D‚Äôarc y Car den).
Everything is seemin gly per fect ‚Äî unti l we
find out t hat E leanor has been mista ken for
someone e lse an d isn‚Äôt su pposed to be in t he 
Goo d Place. T hings quic kly begin to unrave l,
and at the end of the first season , Eleanor ma kes 
the shockin g discover y that ‚Äî spoiler alert ‚Äî
they‚Äôre actua lly in t he Ba d Place an d Mic hael
had been torturin g them t he entire time.
Season two starts immediatel y where season 
one first left off: after Eleanor deduces  that
she an d the other humans are actua lly being 
torture d in t he Ba d Place, Mic hael wipes t heir
memories an d starts t he experiment over a gain
with a few a djustments. However, w hile most
viewers pro bably thought this season wou ld
play out simi larly to t he first by focusing on t hefour humans tr ying to navi gate the rebooted
neighborhood, the show goes in an entirel y 
different direction t hat exponentia lly increases 
the risks for each  character. It‚Äôs a bold  move for
the show to repeate dly stra y from t heir own
premise an d intro duce so many curve balls, but
the pa yoff is worth it. Not onl y does the ‚ÄúThe
Goo d Place‚Äù ex pand the possibilities for future 
episo des, but it a lso pu lls off anot her huge
twist en ding in t he final episo de of season two
that once a gain leaves viewers in t he dark as to
where t he show wi ll go from here.
Besides the constant plot twists, ‚ÄúThe Good
Place‚Äù a lso surprises by provin g to be one o f the
most t hought-provo king, inte llectua l come dies
on television. At its core, the show attem pts to 
answer t he age-old question: Are humans good,
and if not, can the y improve themselves? ‚ÄúThe
Goo d Place‚Äù o ften direct ly addresses et hical
conun drums, suc h as t he tro lley pro blem
in episo de six, an d doesn‚Äôt s hy awa y from
exploring dilemmas w here et hics are constant ly 
challenged. ‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù could have easil y strayed into absurdit y territor y with all the 
ridiculous situations that the characters find 
themse lves in, but instea d mana ges to insert
mora l lessons t hroughout ever y episo de in a
hilarious an d thoughtful way.
There‚Äôs no doubt that ‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù is 
a show un like an y other. It constant ly blows 
up its own premise an d con fronts questions 
of mora lity while the brilliance o f its ensem ble
cast and cleverness of its stor ytellin g allow ‚ÄúThe 
Good Place‚Äù to keep on surprisin g its au dience
and set sta kes higher t han ever for future 
seaso ns. The one obvious downfall is that there 
are onl y 13 short episodes in each season, but
when a TV show‚Äôs bi ggest flaw is that there isn‚Äôt
enou gh of it, that‚Äôs somethin g to be proud of.
With so man y plot twists, t he on ly predictable
thing about ‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù is that it‚Äôs a
forking triump h.

Justin Timberlake‚Äôs ‚ÄúMan of the Woods‚Äù is less a return to form and 
more a half-baked excuse to go on tour. Over an hour long, his most recent album is a meandering, overstuffed affair. Twelve songs break 
four minutes, but rarely justify their own length. Timberlake purloins country, blues, and rock-and-roll to season his typical pop-electronic fusion, but his stylistic experimentation doesn‚Äôt lead to sonic distinction. Instead, Timberlake‚Äôs voice seems buried by the lush, overproduced instrumentation.
The lyrics are equally distancing. Timberlake dives into a rural, 
homespun narrative with enthusiasm, singing stinkers like ‚Äú Ain‚Äôt got no phone, don‚Äôt need it though, ‚Äù and ‚ÄúI knew once I saw that fancy record company man/ And in her face, she knew I was a stan. ‚Äù Timberlake‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlannel‚Äù is the most egregious offender, a mushy ode to love and sartorial choices that ends with a new-age mumble set by wife Jessica Biel about how ‚Äúit‚Äôs in the earth. ‚Äù Timberlake doesn‚Äôt deign to explain, and much of the album follows in the same fashion. 
There are some highlights ‚Äî ‚ÄúMidnight Summer Jam‚Äù sounds 
suspiciously like a ‚ÄúThe 20/20 Experience‚Äù reject, as does ‚ÄúBreeze off the Pond. ‚Äù But they don‚Äôt save the album, instead content to merely remind us of Timberlake‚Äôs more limber, better-received releases. Why listen to this piecemeal offering when you can revisit the classics? Why settle for ‚ÄúBreeze off the Pond‚Äù and its ‚Äúsparkly waves‚Äù?The stylistic mismatch is particularly grating on tracks like ‚ÄúLivin‚Äô 
Off the Land, ‚Äù which begins with a pan-flute paean to the wild and soon segues into ‚Äúbacked up bills on the credit card. ‚Äù Timberlake‚Äôs woodsman affectation fits him poorly, in large part because he refuses to commit fully to the schtick. As such, ‚ÄúMan of the Woods‚Äù is often off-balance, meandering between spiritual platitudes and traditional rhythm and blues topics.
With interludes voiced by Biel and a song (‚ÄúY oung Man‚Äù) devoted 
to his young son, Timberlake bears little resemblance to the disaffected bachelor of ‚ÄúCry Me a River. ‚Äù But this apparent sincerity clashes with the inherent sappiness of lines like ‚ÄúBeautiful boy, got it from your momma/ Damn, she look good, you might get a sister. ‚Äù Despite well-placed intentions, ‚ÄúY oung Man‚Äù ends the album in a worse place than it began. 
‚ÄúMan of the Woods‚Äù is a smorgasbord of ideas, most of which don‚Äôt 
pass muster. It‚Äôs unwieldy and confused; the coherence of ‚ÄúFutureSex/LoveSounds‚Äù seems a property of the past.

course of the season.
vs. Concordia Irvine
After two ear ly runs in t hefirst
innin g, Concor dia held a 2‚Äì0 lead, but
that didn‚Äôt last as UCSD wou ld go on to
level the game at 2‚Äì2 in t he third. Wit h
a runner on base, junio r first baseman 
Tyler Durna stepped to plate and hit a
two-run home run. From t hat point on
the Tritons took  control of the contest
and lead the rest o f the way as t hey put
in one run each  in thefifth and sixth
innin g to capture the lead at 4‚Äì2. In the
fifth, redshirt junior ou tfielder Zan der 
Clarke gave t he Tritons t heir first lead 
of the day when he hit a RBI double
down leftfield. In t he sixt h, redshirt
sophomore uti lity Steven Sc huknecht
hit a RBI sin gle with two runners on
base.  
In t he ei ghth innin g, Durna
exten ded the lead to 5‚Äì2 as he sin gled
to rig ht field to give him a t hree-RBI
day. Concor dia wou ld also get on t he
board in the ei ghth, however, with onl y 
a sin gle run to ma ke it 5‚Äì3. UCSD
closed it out wit h no problem to earn 
itsfirst win of the seaso n.

vs. Colorado Mes a
The Tritons hosted No. 4 Co lorado
Mesa, a team t hat ver y well looked like
one o f the top in Division-II baseball as
it displayed its superiority on t he day 
by defeatin g the Tritons 11‚Äì1. UCSDdid not ima gine having the home
opener en ding wit h that score line; 
however, the team likel y knew it would
be difficult to pull out a win a gainst the
nationa l semi finalist from a year a go. 
UCSD cou ld not mana ge to get
anything going offensively to match theffff
hitting prowess of Colorado Mesa that earned 16 hits to UCSD‚Äôs four. 
Goin
g into the last two innin gs, 
the game was at 5‚Äì0. At t he top o f 
the ei ghth, Co lorado Mesa hit in
three more runs, followed by anot her
three in ninth to put any thought o f 
a comeback to rest. UCSD scored itsonl
y run in the ei ghth.

Despite a disappointin g Friday, the
Tritons redee med themselves with a
dominant 10-3 win over Concordia 
Irvine on Saturda y. Interestin gly 
enou gh, UCSD‚Äôs win came after being
down ear ly once a gain.
In the secon d innin g, Concor dia

the third , the Tritons scored two runs
to take a 2-1 lead. Third baseman, Ale x

UCSD wou ld erase t he lead and not go
behind for the remain der of the game. 
The followin g innin g, UCSD 
scored another three runs to take a
comman ding 5‚Äì1 lead. Concor dia
fought to get back in it in t hefifth with
two runs of its own to make it 5-3. But
UCSD had other plans as Durna hit a 
two-RBI sin gle and Eliopulos hit a two -
run home run to make it four runs in 
the sixt h innin g. Wit h a 9‚Äì3 score line 
going into t he last few innin gs, the
Tritons were in contro l of the game.
The last run o f the game came from a
second home run from Elio pulos to

In its first of a four game awa y stretch , UCSD fell to Concordia

a valiant foe to UCSD , but the Tritons
eventua lly prevai led.
1st Quarte r
UCSD too k thefirst lead of the 
game on senior forward Dala yna
Sampton‚Äôs layup. A lthough the teams
traded baskets throughout t he quarter,
the beginning o f this game prove d to be
a ph ysical affair where defense shined.ffff
Cal Pol y Pomona shot just 31 percent
from thefield, and UCSD didn‚Äôt fare
much better, s hootin g only 23 percent
from t hefield. Wit h two minutes leftinft
the quarter, Cal Pol y Pomona jumped 
to an earl y four-point lead when senior 
forwar d Alyssa Benton san k a s hot
from downtown. Down 12‚Äì8 , UCSD
continued to be a ggressive with the ball 
and earned back-to-back tri ps to the

Shane. Junior guard Joleen Y an g andthen junior guard Ka yla Sato sank their 
free throws, pullin g the Tritons level

After a ti ght first quarter, it was
Cal Poly Pomona w ho too k the first
significant lead of the game, w hen a
three-pointer by sop homore guard
Case y McWilliam was followed b y an 
easy finish b y senior forward Chelsea 
Waddy-Blow insi de. Wit h UCSD
having issues stopping t he high-low 
action an d the postu-u p presence o f the
Broncos, t he lead grew to ei ght. 
That‚Äôs t he moment w hen Y an g 
chose to ta ke over. Y an g got a bucket
from downtown, had a nice layup on
a cut to t he basket, and after a good
defensive possession, nai led anot her

the game. ‚ÄúI was hurtin g a little bit, 
but it was great to have m y teammates
step up.The great t hing a bout our

somebod y else is gonna step up, and the
whole team carried us to that win.
With the score a ll tied up at 42-a ll, a
basket by Williams on a nice hussle play 
and a layup from Sato put t he Tritons

Pomona from this point on thou gh, 
as senior forwar d Prisci lla Broo ks got
back-to-back buckets after an offensive ffff
rebou nd and a steal.  The Broncos were 
controllin g the pace of the game at
that point, an d after another turnover
followed by a Broo ks basket, UCSD
was forced to ta ke a timeout. Things
did not get better a fter the timeout , as
UCSD committed yet another turnover
on a movin g screen by Williams w ho 
was tr ying to free up Yan g for a t hree.
When Ric ketson too k a tri p to the line,
the Broncos lead grew to ei ght with fivefifi
minutes remainin g in the quarter. 
‚ÄúOur coaches do a great job o f 
preparing us for anyt hing. I feel like
we just had to sta y compose d, and we
ended up with the win, ‚Äù Y an g said .
Fina lly, the Tritons answere d, settin g

who forced a turnover and assisted 
Williams for an eas y layup, an d finally 
two free throws b y Sato. Shane stopped
the bleedin g with a basket inside, but
Sampton an d Wi lliams too k over.
Sampton had a layup followin g an
offensive rebound, and then put theffff
Tritons on top wit h anot her put back, 
followed by Wi lliams gettin g fouled 
and sinking both free-t hrows. This set
up w hat was ar guably the play of the
game. UCSD on defense, protectin g 
a four- point lead, switched a screen 
with Wi lliams ta king on Ric ketson. 
Ricketson use d her spee d advanta ge toget aroun d for the layup, but Wi lliams
recovere d at t he last secon d, blocked
the shot, and grabbed the rebound. 
Cal Pol y Pomona then started pla ying
the foul game an d took advanta ge of 
some misse d free t hrows to ma ke it a 
two-point game wit hfive seconds lefifi ft
offa McWilliam clutch three. Aff fter 
exchan ging more free throws, the score
was 68‚Äì66 for the Tritons, but Ca l
Poly Pomona had the ball. On t he last 
possession of the game, senior guard
Taylor Tanita had the tou gh defensive
assignment o f stoppin g McWi lliam, but
Tanita p layed some a dmira ble defense 
to force t he miss from t hree an d snag
the win f or the Tritons.
When asked if there was an y doubt 
in her min d about t he Tritons hanging
on to get t he win, Y ang simp ly answere d
with an em phatic ‚Äúnever. ‚Äù
UCSD was outshot b y Cal Pol y 
Pomona over t he game, but after

and Waddy-Blow a ll score d in double
figures, wit h Ric ketson a dding fivefifi
rebou nds and five assists to her 22 fifi
points, a game-hi gh, but the Tritons
