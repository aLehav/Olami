Grappling with a $564 mil-
lion budget shortfall, the 
California State University sys-tem announced plans Tuesday to cut enrollment by 40,000 stu-dents over the next two years.
“Denying students access to 
the California State University is just about the worst thing I can do during a recession, ” Chancellor Charles B. Reed said. “But we have to provide a quality higher education to students, and we cannot educate more students with less. ”
The university system 
received 266,152 applications this year, a 53-percent increase from last year. CSU officials attribute most of the increased demand to  students hoping to transfer from community col-lege, who had to wait to apply in the fall after spring enrollment was cancelled last year.“One thing I know is that 
in the past, Cal State was very lenient in admitting students who hadn’t completed all of their course work or liberal arts requirements, ” Reed said. “I believe those students are going to be turned away. ”
According to the Contra 
Costa Times, the campuses will 
cut enrollment by adhering more strictly to CSU policy on aca-demic dismissal of students who aren’t performing well, while potentially eliminating winter and spring admission for the 2010-11 academic year.
“The state funds a finite 
number of [students], ” Cal Poly spokesman Tim Lynch told the 
Contra Costa Times . “If the uni-
versity exceeds that number, it 
incurs the entire cost of edu-cation for those additional stu-dents. Y es, those additional stu-dents will pay fees, but those +;=\W;TI[P

Barely a year after the A.S. Council declined to sponsor a 
student-fee referendum to fund the Loft — Price Center East’s year-old multipurpose venue — some councilmem-bers are reconsidering the request but discussing a pos-
sible effort to lower the proposed fee, which has climbed to $4.91. 
The A.S. Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs and 
chair of the University Centers Advisory Board Jordan Taylor, a member of the A.S. special committee currently discussing the proposed referendum, said councilmembers are working to deter-mine an appropriate Loft fee using enrollment numbers. Based on recent figures provided by the Office of the Registrar,  the commit-tee suggested redistributing the fee from the originally proposed $4.91 for undergraduates to $4.47 for undergraduates and $3.82 for graduate students.

Contributing Writer
UCSD graduate student  Luke 
Barrington, along with the UCSD 
Computer Audition Lab, has created a music recommendation program to rival the iTunes Genius feature.
Barrington and his colleagues 
took the idea behind the popular Apple software — recommending new songs to users based on what they already like — and created a program that makes suggestions based on sounds and acoustic con-tent of a song, rather than suggesting commonly related artists or utilizing the purchase history of others who also purchased the song.
“[Apple Genius] is great and 
works well on a filter system, ” Barrington said. “It has over 6 billion songs and tons of collaborative data, so if you are buying a certain song from iTunes, chances are that it has had people who have also bought that song. ” Even if the songs in a user’s 
library were downloaded elsewhere, Apple Genius uses Gracenote soft-ware to analyze songs and match them to tunes in their database. 
Barrington’s music recommenda-
tion program, on the other hand, analyzes the acoustic content of the song and then matches it with other similar-sounding songs within the same genre.
“We’re trying to have a machine 
that listens to music, and then analyzes the song based on the sounds of that particular song, ” Barrington said.
Because of its more complex 
design, Barrington said his pro-gram will be able to recommend a greater range of songs. Apple Genius is limited to recom-mending songs available for purchase in the iTunes store. 
However, creating a pro-
gram that actually “listens” to the acoustic content of every song has proven a vast undertaking, accord-ing to Barrington. In order to make a recommendation, the program has to review over 50 examples of each genre before analyzing a song, in order to determine what genre it will 
fall into. 
To provide initial data 
for his music recommen-
dation program, Barrington 
created the Twitter computer 
game Herd It.
Herd It requires players 
to answer questions such as 
“Is this song happy, sad or 
romantic?” based on the music playing. The player gets points if his or her 
answer matches everyone 
else’s, thus motivating players to 
categorize songs into their most 
correct genres. The music recom-
mendation program could then use 
the players’ answers as base genre 
examples. 
“The idea behind Herd It is 
to collect consensus, ” Barrington said. “So even if some people answer incorrectly or weirdly, we get the average response of all users. In the future, we plan to learn person or demographic-specific models... like ‘Girls from SoCal think that this tune rocks, ’ or ‘European housewives find this song romantic’ . ” 
Herd It attracted over 2,000 players 
in three days, all of whom have made the music recommendation program more efficient, Barrington said.
Barrington presented his pro-
gram at the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference in Japan on Oct. 28.
In the future, Barrington hopes to 
use the software to provide recom-mendation data for local San Diego bands who have not yet released albums on iTunes, and therefore would not appear in Apple Genius.
So far, Apple has not acknowl-
edged the program.

Loft Director Martin Wollesen 
presented a similar referendum to 
the council during Winter Quarter 2009, but councilmembers voted to exclude the Loft fee — then proposed at $2.62 per student per quarter — from the A.S. activity-fee referendum, after determining that the Loft did not exhibit enough need compared to other items on the ballot. 
After Wollesen brought the request 
before the council a second time dur-ing Spring Quarter, the council once again denied the Loft a place on the spring ballot, this time due to concerns over a lack of student oversight in the venue’s operations. A.S. President Donna Bean was particularly reluctant to allocate student funds to a facility that did not have students on its board of managers. 
According to Taylor, 
oversight is once again a crucial issue in the discus-sion of this year’s referen-dum request.
“It’s important to know 
who would oversee fees and make sure they would be spent correctly, ” he said. “We’re trying to work with A.S. to determine the best setup and review language  of oversight together. ”
However, A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta said discussion of over-sight language is prema-ture at this time.
“We first need to find 
out if there should be a referendum at all, ” he said. “Personally, I believe student over-sight is key to any referendum to go through A.S. and a cause I want to continually advocate. ” 
Wollesen said he, too, supports 
giving students a place in determining the  the venue’s operations. 
“It is absolutely appropriate for 
students to provide oversight of the budget they fund, ” he said. “We think this is a good thing. ”
Taylor suggested a system where 
students from organizations such as UCAB, Associated Students and the Graduate Student Association would 
have influence over Loft spending and 
re-approve budgets on a yearly basis. 
In this scenario, if the Loft accrued 
an excessive amount of debt, the board could reevaluate the budget and vote to redefine student contributions.
“ A referendum is essentially a con-
tract to better the stuadents, ” Taylor said. “We need to make sure we have some control over our money. For 
example, if the board says we’re not 
happy with how things are going and how money is being spent, we can say that those funds can’t be filled. ” 
The Loft is currently financed by a 
combination of one-time funds from the Student Affairs Office, student registration fees and external sources of revenue such as profits from venue rental and ticket sales. 
According to Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Ed Spriggs, the Loft’s current location in Price Center East was originally planned as additional space for the Alumni Association. 
“When sufficient funding could 
not be raised from donations to fund that part of the construction, Student Affairs stepped in and essentially pur-chased the space from the campus, ” he said, adding that the Student Affairs department provided money suffi-
cient to fund three-quar-ters of Loft operations. 
Twenty-one percent of 
the Loft’s current operat-ing budget is financed by registration fees, includ-ing the salaries of two full-time staffers. 
The venue’s other 
sources include funds con-tributed by A.S. Concerts & Events and University Centers, which both allo-cate roughly $30,000 per year to the Loft. 
Wollesen said current 
sources of funding are not enough to maintain Loft operations. 
“While the Reg Fee 
Committee is very sup-portive of the Loft, it does 
not have the resources to fund its event budget, ” Wollesen said.
As of Winter Quarter 2010, the 
venue will no longer have a major source of funding, which would result in fewer events, admission changes, rental charges for student organiza-tions and student layoffs, he said. The A.S. referendum, if passed, would be the venue’s primary source of revenue, 
providing an additional $240,000 per 
year in funding — or 45 percent of the Loft’s proposed budget.  
The Loft created a street team in 
an effort to attract support for the fee increase. According to street-team member Desi Kalcheva, this quarter’s project is to raise awareness of the referendum.
“We go to people to educate them 
on why we’re unique and need fund-ing, ” Kalcheva said.
The council will vote on referen-
dum specifics on Dec. 3.

By Tanja Fijalkowski
Contributing Writer
Paul Drake announced his retire-
ment on Nov. 6, leaving his position of 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs after 25 years of service. 
Beginning his career at UCSD 
as a professor of political science, Drake became director of the Latin-American studies program before being promoted to the position of dean of the division of social sciences in 1994. Drake served in the position for 12 years before being appointed to the position of vice chancellor in 2006.   
Drake said his goal as vice chancel-
lor was to preserve the academic core of the university, which he described as a fusion of world-class research and internationally renowned education.    
In 1998, Drake became a key 
member of the International Studies Advisory Committee, which created the international-studies department and the seven majors that fall under it. In 2004, as dean of social sciences, he granted a special allocation of $48,000 to the preservation of the Heritage Language Program.  
Drake is concerned that the uni-
versity’s current budget constraints will negatively impact diversity efforts at UCSD. 
“Diversity has been a constant 
effort, ” he said. “That’s been one of the disappointments of freezing over 100 faculty positions. One of the ways to promote diversity is to bring in more faculties, which we can’t do right now. ”  
Drake also established a fund-
raising campaign designed to create student scholarships, which received a $530,000 grant in the year 2000 to support graduate students work-ing in the social sciences. The grant was the single largest gift UCSD had yet received in its campaign to raise money for graduate support.  
The retiring vice chancellor has 
also been involved in efforts to make the new furlough program for faculty less onerous: He played an instrumen-tal part in the creation of the Joint Senate-Administration Task Force on Budget Reconciliation.
Drake said he is concerned about 
the rate at which student fees are increasing.
“If the state reduces the amount of money by that much, who’s going to pay for the education?” he said. “We are unfortunately moving toward the model of a private university, where students pay the whole fare, and the state doesn’t pay for anything. But it’s the only way. ”
Drake noted that the fee increases 
will most affect middle-class students, who will reserve less financial aid and will be expected to pay more in tuition.  
“I think that UCSD needs to figure 
out how to be great without relying on state funding, ” he said. “We’re getting down to the bone here, and it’s going to hurt. But we have to get through this, and we have to move on. I think the notion of shared sacrifice is true. Everybody is suffering. ”    
He expressed concerns about the 
university in the coming years.    
“I’m very worried about UCSD for 
the next year or so, ” Drake said, “But I am optimistic in the long run. It will survive, and we will thrive. ”   
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has 
launched a national search to find a replacement for Drake, who will be leaving the university Oct. 1, 2010.

fees cover only a slice of the overall 
cost of education. The bottom line is that if we did not cap enrollment, we would end up diluting everyone’s education. ”
The CSU system has 23 campuses 
across California. The system currently enrolls 450,000 students and employs 48,000 faculty and staff. Last year, the university raised student fees by 30 percent and implemented furloughs for nearly all campus employees. 
“The effect on students is huge, ” 
Miles Nevin, executive director of the California Students Association, said. “What that does is decrease access to the system to qualified students, and that’s the bottom line. More impor-tantly, while it’s going to have an immediate impact, the greater impact is that the CSU fuels the state’s econ-omy, and when you’re not educating students to become police officers and nurses and engineers, we’re not going to be growing our economy. ”
Cal State Northridge University 
senior Irene Darbinyan said she was disappointed to hear that fewer stu-dents would have access to the CSU system.
“I believe that every applicant 
deserves an equal opportunity for enrollment, ” Darbinyan said. “It is truly disappointing to see an increase of students seeking to create a better future for themselves be denied the benefits of attending a CSU. ”
University officials stressed the 
importance of applying for admis-sion by November 30, when about half of the system’s campuses will stop accepting applications for all freshmen and most transfer students. They also encouraged students to apply to the campus closest to their residential area, as preference is given to local applicants. 
Reed previewed the proposed 
2010-11 budget that the CSU Board of Trustees will vote on at its Nov. 17 meeting. The budget will then go before Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
and the state Legislature.
Labeled a “recover and reinvest” 
budget, the proposal requests that the 
state restore a total of $884 million in funding, including a request for the Legislature to fund a projected 10-percent student-fee increase.
“This is a very ambitious budget 
in these very challenging times, ” Reed said. “But it is critical that the state 
legislature and administration realize 
the true fiscal needs to run the CSU. ”

Last Saturday night, while you 
and I were drinking away the pain of another sleep-
less school week, the House of Representatives was busy working out the nitty-gritty details of a bill that plans to overhaul our nation’s health-care system. The long-awaited bill passed by a slim margin of 220 to 215 votes. Cue resounding applause, cheers and high-fives: victory at last. 
Except for one crucial detail. 
A few hours before the vote, an 
amendment that prohibits federal 
money from going toward insurance policies that cover abortions was tacked onto the bill — largely a result of pressure from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who negotiated with top officials in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office on Friday, and who made personal appeals to their congressmen and even President Barack Obama. 
Their resistance is rooted in the 
Catholic conviction that life begins at fertilization, and that ending a human life — even before birth — is morally wrong.
The bishops absurdly condemned 
the pre-amendment plan as an “accounting gimmick, ” seeing as the bill as proposed would fund abortion-covering insurers, but wouldn’t actually use tax dollars to pay for abortions. The group threatened to withdraw support for the legislation unless the bill included a stipulation that prohibited federal money from going to any insurance provider that covered abortion — “forcing” Democrats who needed an official OK from those pointy-hatted zealots to withdraw their support for the bill.
So much for separation of church 
and state.
The USCCB wields this ridiculous 
upper hand thanks to voting clout of 68 million Catholics in the U.S., as well as the fervent political activism of its members — who are regularly in contact with lawmakers — upon whom they don’t hesitate to rain input. Recently, the group distributed fliers to every parish in the nation asking churchgoers to pray for abor-tion restrictions and contact repre-sentatives, encouraging them to push for bills in their favor. 
The amendment’s very real inclu-
sion transcends the often theoreti-cal church-state separation debate. Should it become law, the measure would likely force insurers (87 percent of which currently cover abortions) to drop abortions from their plans in order to meet the new health-care market.
The final bill reveals the discon-
certing influence our country’s reli-gious leaders have over their govern-ment. Bishops now have even more proof that they can be a dominating force in politics — a disturbing pros-pect that threatens the separation of church and state.
So — despite considerable biparti-
san support — the USCCB’s heavy behind-the-scenes lobbying and grassroots organization left the bill tainted by religious doctrine. And suddenly, thanks to some influential

Raise your hand if you’re as burnt out on being angry about the impending student-
fee increases as we are. The picket signs, teach-ins, heartbreaking anec-dotal forums, commissions on the future — all gallant efforts toward change — seem to be riling a stag-nant sort of heat. Nobody can take another financial hit in this economy, and the UC Board of Regents has no goddamn idea what to do about it.
We’re trying our hardest to avoid 
a defeatist attitude, and, ultimately, we would like to commend the protestors. The Sept. 24 walkout, though conducted with a not-so-community-building ruthlessness 
and somewhat meager turnout  
compared to Berkeley, was UCSD’s 
biggest rebel-rouser since the Prop. 8 fiasco: a refreshing shot of outcry we could all care about. 
But it doesn’t come 
as much surprise that the walkouts ended there. Principally, we’re all students, not 
professional protes-
tors — even those designated to protest 
by student councils and orgs have an outside life to deal with. So, thank you for trying. It’s easy for ignorant, cynical passersby  and newspaper 
shrews to dismiss a protest as too small to accomplish anything, but that’s the fault of those who weren’t out there, not those who made what-ever push they could.
That said, the intention of student 
government systemwide to camp 
out at the Nov. 17 regents meet-ing — where they will vote on a 32-percent student-fee increase — is a waste of momentum. We need to choose a battle with at least some sliver of hope for victory. Despite any illusions of a “public comment period” the regents  decided on this 
fee increase a long time ago. There is not a chance in hell they’ll compro-mise the prestige of our university or make more faculty cuts to keep student fees low — especially know-ing there will always be applicants too apathetic or uncaring to resist a heftier tuition bill (or resist handing it off to their parents).
Sure, the protests have been 
enough to scare UC President Mark G. Yudof into the depths of his office, spitting out lionhearted letters to avoid facing the pissed-off students and staff stomping around his cam-puses. We also seem to have scared him into propping up a mighty fine financial-aid plan (though who knows, maybe that grand gesture flowed from the sheer kindness of his Blue and Gold heart). The fact that the UCSD financial aid depart-ment has already sent 2009-10 grant recipients its updated Winter Quarter allocations to accommo-date the fee increase — a paranoid effort to qualm pre-decision fears or outrage — is a clear indication that the regents already have their minds 
made up.
It is indeed necessary to show 
the regents that there will always be 
a pack of watchdogs on their every move. But student leaders hold an even greater responsibility: to find ways of making a real change. It’s a much more daunting and unstable task — and requires breaking away from the standard march down 
Library Walk — but we’ve got to 
target the only real source of fund-ing left in this devastating statewide crisis: Californians. Lord knows they’re all broke too, but taxes aren’t anywhere near a historical high. Not to mention they’re already funding a variety of causes less impactful (albeit noble) to the future of our state and nation.
What we really need, of course, 
is a constitutional convention to change our state’s voter-locked fund-ing methods which make it virtually impossible for legislators to shave spare change off less-hurting tax recipients. Chances are, even our 
hard-jawed governor would find it in his heart to fund higher education if he had some more leg room to ration the bank account — and many other legislators have expressed a strong 
desire to support the University of California. With a slightly social-ist move toward more government-controlled tax revenue, it would just take a few simpler “marches on Sacramento” 
— as Yudof so heroically put it — to cure the rise in student fees. May’s statewide ballot measures, under the protection of 1B, attempted to preserve as much emergency funding for education as possible. In the end, it was California voters who trashed it. We need to make these voters see how important an affordable educa-tion is to their personal and public future.
A.S. President Utsav Gupta has 
discussed a possible effort to lobby the San Diego community for its support of the UC cause. However, 
there are no signs of interest so far 
from his External Affairs counter-parts in jumping on the initiative. If any of the A.S. budget or manpower was allotted to letting Californians know the dire situation we’re in, we might finally be making some head-way in an affordable future, where it counts.
Non-UC-affiliated citizens hear the fringe noise of angry students and see Yudof ’s name in the news-paper, but unless they have a child currently enrolled in the university or are themselves alumni, the public-education plight is not necessarily at the top of their list of budgetary concerns. 
Here’s an idea: we band together 
to run a public information cam-paign targeting voters. We ask them “Where would you be without your college education?” or “Where will your child/community be without the same?” and spread it statewide on mailbox flyers and public  service 
announcements, asking Californians to bug their representatives in Sacramento, or just keep the cause in mind on a future ballot. Through these efforts we might come that much closer to convincing those who have the power to make a difference that access to public higher educa-tion is worthy of their support.
Unfortunately, at this point, 
by targeting Yudof and the dead-spirited regents, we’re attempting to beat down a bolted gate with an insufficient army. Maybe they’re just not being creative enough in the search for alternative funding — or are too wussy to try and push around the millions in graduate research — but the fact is, the leaders of the UC system have not found a solution to maintain the quality of the university without additional support from stu-dent fees. So let’s stop complaining and find it ourselves.

OPINION THURSDAY , NOVEMBER 12, 2009  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 
Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to address 
Cheryl Hori’s Nov. 2 article entitled 
“Slippery Ground” .
The bill — introduced by our 
State Senate Majority Leader Alberto Torrico — makes officials from the University of California and the California State University system think that resources for their schools would be reduced. However, the bill provides them with sufficient funding. 
Cutting state funding for higher 
education because higher education is funded by oil production is some-thing that should concern UC and CSU officials. However, they need to look at the whole picture. The state of California is having a financial crisis, and it needs to find a way to stop that crisis. If the state cannot find a way to stop it, then it would be in deeper trouble than it already is — and so would the educational system, includ-ing the UC system and CSU system. The officials from these systems need to understand how catastrophic the financial situation is for California and understand how this bill would help California as a whole. This bill, if passed, would be one way to allevi-ate the state financial crisis if the state decides to cut state funding for higher education. This will prevent the state and the educational system from dys-function.
I believe that this fear of cuts in 
state funding to higher education is unreasonable. Instead of blindly rejecting a bill that could hurt state funding for its schools, UC and CSU officials should look into the effect of this bill not only for their schools, but also for the whole state as well.

Freshman, Muir CollegeDear Editor,
I consider it an achievement of 
America today that it is generally con-
sidered unacceptable to maliciously ridicule or intimidate an entire eth-nicity in public. Expressing disgust for gays, on the other hand, is merely considered controversial. Though homophobic rhetoric may raise an eyebrow, it will rarely trigger anyone to object to the speaker’s message.
At RIMAC, while changing my 
clothes in the men’s locker room, I overheard a rowdy group of three to four  guys in the aisle next to me. Their 
conversation went as follows:
Person 1: “ ... [Somebody] is a 
homo. ”
Person 2: “Hey, what you got 
against gay people?” 
Person 1: “ A lot!”Malicious laughter ensued.To these dear gentlemen: As per-
verted, aberrant and pansy you may think us to be, no — you still can’t use homophobic speech in public. Not in general society, and especially not at UCSD. If you replace the word “homo” with any racial epithet, I’m confident that even you would find it unacceptable to make that same joke.

pamphleteers, the health-care discus-
sion has morphed into an abortion debate. Ironic: What could be more pro-life than guaranteed health care?
Let’s get something straight: 
Abortion is a medical procedure to which every woman has the right. It is just as medically legitimate as heart surgery or cancer treatment. This fundamental reproductive right shouldn’t be trampled on by the moral teachings of the religious com-munity.
On the other hand, I accept that 
abortion is a polarizing national issue — a recent poll by the Pew Research Group reported that only 45 percent of Americans said abortion should even be legal  — so I admit that it probably shouldn’t be funded by our tax dollars.
But the amendment goes much 
further  than to just ensure federal 
money won’t pay for abortions — which doesn’t happen currently anyway (and wouldn’t have, were the amendment not hastily slapped on the bill). By limiting the availability of a medical procedure 1.3 million American women need every year, the bill would deal the biggest blow to abortion since partial-birth abor-tions were outlawed in 2003. Angry Democrats held their noses and voted in favor of the bill anyway, arguing that passing the bill would give them an opportunity to hash out the details on the Senate floor later.
Diffusing the issue for now may 
have allowed the bill to get past the House, but with a Democratic major-ity in both houses of Congress for the first time in 12 years, it’s time Democrats stop cowering at religious leaders’ bullying and take a firm stand in favor of abortion rights.
Y es, this legislation is historic. Y es, 
it’s a monumental victory in a long battle toward universal health care. But at the end of the day, in a coun-try that seems to be slowly turning its back on a woman’s right to choose, it’ s just as important to make sure we don’t lose that battle in the future just to win the health-care war today.

Drums:      Not     DeadI’m having a really hard time per-
suading people like you that I’m a genius. It’s surprising how much 
effort it takes to convince people of something so obvious. But I think I’ve finally found a way. It’s gonna take some time, a little investment and a lit-tle trust, but it’s the only sure-fire way to get you to believe. All I need is for you to keep in mind that, in the sum-mer of 2010, Scott Pilgrim is gonna be a big fucking deal. And when this hap-pens, just remember: I called it first.
So what is Scott Pilgrim, and why 
does it matter so much? Let’s see. To begin, Scott Pilgrim is the greatest fucking thing to happen to comics and print media for many, many years. The last time such an overwhelming phe-nomenon enveloped our tiny lives was when X-Men hit the big screen and 
Watchmen  made it to  Time M agazine’s 
list of the 100 best novels of all time.
But don’t make the mistake of 
believing Scott Pilgrim has some lofty philosophical or existential meaning. It’s more like the embodiment of our generation — ours being the young twentysomethings raised on Mario , 
Pokemon  and Nintendo with both a 
lust and fear for life, aimlessly search-ing for purpose and direction without an inkling of what it might be. This comic is made for us, by us, to speak for us. It’s the closest thing we will ever have to an all-encompassing identity.
OK, so I’m being a bit hyperbolic, 
but I maintain that Pilgrim is repre-sentative of our generation (at least in terms of alternative pop culture). The comic depicts everyday problems without sacrificing any of the cultural memes it’s wrapped in. For instance, what would you do before meeting an ex? Y ou save at a save point! Or, what’s the one thing stopping you from enter-ing someone’s heart? The password!
Y ou can look at everything objec-
tively and disregard your dilemmas as the mere stuff of whining, but, in actuality, your problems are much more severe than anyone else’s. The real trouble in life is emotional bag-Critical      Hit!

How long does it take 
to destroy the world?  According to director 
Roland Emmerich, a yawn-inducing two hours and 40 minutes.  That’s right: The brave soul who stamped his name on “Independence Day” and “The Day After Tomorrow” is back to cleanse the planet all over again — this time, with $250 million worth of gleaming vengeance.  
While it’s clear that the lump 
sum went in to some outrageous special effects — including the collapse of the Vatican, a squashed White House and hun-dreds of crumbling skyscrapers that all too closely resemble the Twin Towers — it’s also clear that very little was spent on the feeble cause of a casting call or halfway-decent screenwriter.
Within the first few min-
utes, we meet Adrian (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a paranoid geologist who has uncovered what he believes to be the first sign of the end of the world. Get ready for a solid slew of panicked “My God! I thought we’ d have more time!” cries, and — of course — the unforgettable “This is a suicide mission!”  
After some more ingenious 
one-liners and a mouthful of indecipherable pseudo-scien-tific mumbo jumbo, we come to a shaky semi-understanding that the earth is going to shit because of something called 
“crust dis-placement, ” which somehow correlates with the Mayan doomsday predic-tion for December 21, 2012.  
While Adrian breaks the 
news to the U.S. president (Danny Glover), we are intro-duced to Jackson (a brooding John Cusack), failed author and father whose struggle to reconnect with his eternally disappointed children is drawn out painfully to the end credits.  With a nagging ex (Amanda Peet) ready to nail him for his inadequacies and her new man for competition, the last thing Jackson needs is a cataclysmic emergency to worry about — but Cusack has never been too lucky.  
It’s not long before earth-
quakes spider-web the nation, and civilization as we know it

ike every other year 
this millenium, 2009 has seen its 
genres progressively diverging and converging into tasty lo-fi mush and sheeny hi-fi shine. It must get exhausting for bloggers, searching for the latest-greatest group to gift their stamp of approval. Tapes ’n Tapes, Voxtrot, Crystal Stilts — does anyone care about them anymore? Sadly, the Drums, a Brooklyn four-piece (via Florida) headlining the Loft on Sunday, is the latest of those bright-eyed flashes in the pan.
Well, maybe it’s still hard to say. 
They’ve only released one six-song EP and their debut record doesn’t even have a proper release date yet — though you wouldn’t know it by the surging hype-meter. Alas, such is the fickle nature of Internet popularity. Keep in mind that the Strokes went to Europe with three songs and became overnight inter-national playboys with Is This It . 
So what do these dudes sound like, and are they worth your $5? Imagine the Cure and Joy Division frolicking in the summer sun (as best ’80s mopers can), starring in their very own campy ’50s beach-party movie montage. Standout cut “Let’s Go Surfing” maintains a dark double-speed bassline with syncopated whistling and hand-claps, reveling in its catchiness. It’s an artfully constructed machine designed for insta-pleasure, and will make for a sweat-soaked live set. On the more morose end of the spectrum, however, EP-ender “Down by the Water” pairs Jonathan Pierce’s “If  they stop  loving you/ I won’t stop loving you” croons with uncanny bass murmurs and splash-reverb beats. 
So if you’re looking for some 
honed post-punk this Sunday, you’re guaranteed a quality (if abbreviated) show with poten-tial surprises — namely, some unheard cuts expected for the LP and hype-worthy live energy. Who knows? Their endless out-bursts of sun and sadness could be the perfect recipe for UCSD.     Guardian : Besides your most noticeable 
influences, what weird or obscure bands are you guys really into? Any super popu-lar songs from this year that you loved?Drums: I’m not sure which are the more 
noticeable ones. We’re into a lot of bands from Scotland (the Orchids, Orange Juice). Also, a lot of great bands from the Northwest or early ’90s in general (Cool Rays, Mission of Burma). Songs from this year? “Tonight, ” by the Smith Westerns.G: To be honest, I had to look up the lyrics

I almost wanted it to be “Obama. ” Like he would care if you went surfing.D: Well, pop music has a tradition of being more straightforward with everything. It’s more about giving to the listener.

we were so disconnected from everything at that point, we weren’t aware of one. It was the lack of music there that brought us here.G: Y ou’ve managed to tour internationally from 
one EP , Summertime! , playing a show in Iceland 
and a handful in England. What was Iceland like, and how’ d you get that opportunity? Did you get much time to explore Reykjavik?D: Iceland was great. We laughed a lot. It’s a beautiful place, despite all the rain. Everything in Reykjavik looks stunning, and the kids that go to shows give everything to a performance that they like. I’m not sure it even matters who it is, as long as that specific performance does something for them.  G: Y ou’re playing a few more shows in California 
after the Loft date, but what’s the next step for the Drums? How is progress on the first album, and when can we expect to hear it?D: We are looking to release the album early next 
year. It’s essentially all done; written and recorded. We have some loose ends to tie up but we’re excit-ed to release it. We’re set to tour, globally, through the fall of next year.

Lincoln and Booth can empathize. The aban-doned, 30-something-year-old children of phi-landering parents, Lincoln and Booth are black men in white America. One works as a Lincoln impersonator (white face/top hat) at an arcade, while the other aspires to be a street hustler. As they struggle with racism, poverty and the fair-er sex, the motif of a three-card monte reveals the brothers’ illusions of personal identity.
“Lean in close and watch me close, watch 
me close now, ” Booth repeats while practicing his card trick. With this invitation, playwright Suzan-Lori Parks coaxes us to challenge the play’s face value. “Topdog”  pities a fractured 
African-American family living in a dilapidat-ed inner-city apartment with dreams deferred (insert ninth-grade “ A Raisin in the Sun” essay here). But the race card nearly disappears as Lincoln and Booth pick up the game of cards, and their sibling rivalry rises to the forefront. So much that — though a pre-show “Enjoy the mothafuckin’ show, mothafuckers” promises comedic relief — embroiled argumentation over mesmerizing rounds of three-card monte has wrung the audience’s capacity for attentive-ness dead dry by the three-hour mark. 
After a near-death shooting, Lincoln leaves 
the trade to impersonate Honest Abe for a liv-ing: He lets tourists aim phony pistols at his head while he “makes up songs, makes plans. ” Booth, meanwhile, takes hustling up as a get-rich-quick scheme for impressing his lover, Grace. Her symbolic absence throughout the play foreshadows the absolution that Lincoln and Booth will ultimately face.
When Booth finally gives in, we root 
for him. After all, con man  is surely a step 
up from department-store thief. But when Lincoln loses his job to a wax dummy, he finds himself drawn back into the thug life. Booth instantly adopts a competitive hostil-ity toward his elder brother, vying to topple Lincoln from his “topdog” pedestal.
A single bed, sofa and makeshift crate ‘n’ 
cardboard dining table cramp the already close quarters of the Arthur Wagner Theatre, and the suffocation created by this compact set mirrors the ballooning egos of the brothers. Bouquets of bare light bulbs hang upside down from the ceiling to aggrandize the brothers’ financial woes, and their soft glow — under the set design of Sarah Cogan — opens space for familial love despite the bickering.
 In a play that leans heavily on the acting 
chops of its two-man cast, both Johnny Gill and Bowman Wright depict characters so divergent in personality that when Lincoln questions, “Is we really blood brothers?” it seems plausible. As Booth, Gill oscillates grace-fully from the pelvic-thrusting highs of “sexual release” down to the tear-jerking lows of the demoralizing final scene. Wright’s Lincoln is an equally nuanced performance, rife with mono-tone rhyme-bustin’ and repressed anger, which provides a direct foil for Booth’s unrestraint. 
As Lincoln and Booth bash and thrash each 
other, they initiate a cycle in which, ultimately, the winner is unclear. Under the direction of Nadine George-Graves, however, this produc-tion certainly emerges a dog on top. So watch it. And watch it close now.

literally falls through the 
cracks. (Cue homeless man holding “Repent, the end is near” sign.) 
Woody Harrelson, as 
the archetypal googly-
eyed hippie who knew 
it all along, forewarns Jackson about his family’s impending doom if they fail to secure a spot on a government-funded Noah’s Ark operation: three mas-sive zeppelin-looking ships designed to carry the feds (and the rich) to safety.  
Oops! Did I give away 
too much? Oh well. After a side-glance at the trailer, you can guess this film’s not exactly groundbreak-ing — no pun intended — given the soaring rates of second-string actors and explosions.Like any other apoca-
lypse narrative, you’ve got the quintessential father-son sap, the crazed scientist with the answers, the average Joe who just 
happens to know how to 
fly a plane, the limo that can hop crevices, the hand that clutches the edge of the cliff just in time, the dramatic “West Wing” DC shots, and the human race bowing in prayer as a tsunami engulfs the land. Essentially, Emmerich’s latest is a compilation of every high-grossing disas-ter movie you’ve ever seen.
But hey, if think you 
can handle dude saying, “I feel like something is pull-ing us apart” to his girl-friend just as the ground splits at their feet, all the power to you.   gage, which is precisely where the comic excels. Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers’ seven evil ex-boy-friends might be the best metaphor for relationships and emotional baggage that I’ve ever seen, heard or read in any print media. Aside from the fact that it brilliantly compares every arc of a relationship to a trial in a video game, it begs the question: What happens after you defeat the final ex-boyfriend? What happens when there’s no one left to fight anymore? Do you yourself become the evil ex-boyfriend?
Obviously, it’s a lot more compli-
cated than that, and the genius of the comic lies in its exploration of these messy dynamics. All the characters in the story — and their conflicts, their passions, their hopes, their fears, etc. — are things we can irrefutably relate to. If you have it in you to accuse a character of being an asshole, then you’ve probably been one as well.
I can go on about how one char-
acter represents naive angst or how another represents transitional aban-donment — there’s so much to dissect. And I realize that all I’m really doing is saying how awesome it is, over and over. But when the movie adaptation comes out next summer, you’re gonna want to know why it’s so awesome. And then, when you read the comic, you’ll understand. I don’t want you to be like everyone else, just following some trend. I want you to laugh like you’re in on a secret. So find Scott Pilgrim, and read it. Before it’s too late.

Staff Writer
Classic rock fans, rejoice: Y our 
dream film is here. As for every-body else, well, you better start 
enjoying flower power and sticking it to the man right about now.
But take heed, because nothing 
in “Pirate Radio” is taken seriously. Considering the plot is driven by nothing more than sheer ridiculous-ness, it’s hard to believe that the film was inspired by true-to-life historical events. 
The latest from director Richard 
Curtis (taking a far leap from “Love Actually”), “Radio” is a wack-o take on the heyday  of pirate radio sta-
tions — a phenomenon inspired by the British government’s
 censorship of 
rock ‘n’ roll in the 1960s. In this case, a group of renegade deejays band together on an old ship anchored in the North Sea to broadcast popular hits from such subverseive rebels as the Who,  Jimi Hendrix and the 
Rolling Stones, to name a few. 
In addition to an inevitably kick-
ass soundtrack, the film’s small char-ma lie in its slew of over-the-top char-acters. Though they’re all probably smashed, the actors seem to be having so much fun trying to outdo each oth-er’s personas that it’s impossible not to get sucked into the shitshow. Dueling deejays  Gavin (Rhys Ifans) and the 
Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) are 
particularly fun to watch, each lost in his own idiosyncrasies as the pair cavort around the ship like the rock-stars they idolize. 
Though the ’60s decadence, discography and dance provide an addictive time capsule for all those babies of baby boomers who spend the better part of life wishing they hadn’t missed out on Woodstock and JFK, the film’s sloppy script often compromises its flow. 
In a particularly jolting moment of 
self-awareness, the Count proclaims, “These are the best years of our lives. ” While that may be true, the line feels so out of place within the deejay’s “I don’t give a fuck” anthem that we’re bound to wonder what Curtis was smoking when he wrote it — and where we can get some.
Though the maritime station 
broadcasts for several years without reprimand, the evil government even-tually finds a way to stop the music. (Sorry, Rihanna.) But, like true pirates, the DJs fight the law out of loyalty to their fans, and adopt a broadcast-or-die attitude. Or go to prison, of course.
Despite a sparse plot, there is still 
plenty of space for humor, and the actors are chock full of it. But when Curtis falls back on cheap slapstick rather than allowing the talent to unfold, the close confines of the ship begin to suffocate everyone involved. 
At times, “Radio” seems a missed 
opportunity for depth in the story of Carl (Tom Sturridge) — a wide-eyed 18-year-old who comes of age aboard the ship, “ Almost Famous” style — more than anything. Without even a drop of emotional fanfare, an awk-ward gap is left in the narrative. But if you’re only in it for a head-banging good time, this one’s for you.FILMREVIEW
ALBUMREVIEW
Is it just me, or does Dashboard Confessional make nothing but breakup albums?
Emo songsmith Chris Carrabba 
has always been sentimental, but Alter the Ending  takes it one step 
further for a never-ending lament of relationships gone bad, with a track for every new and bitter ending imaginable.
Lead single “Belle of the 
Boulevard” tries for clever and sweet-cheeked, but fails miserably at the tear-jerking sentiment it tries far too hard to evoke. The best Confessional can offer us is the brilliant realization that “life is always hard, ” contrived loveliness dribbling from a soft gui-tar, one incessant piano chord and whispery backup that grows laugh-ably earnest at the chorus. Falling far short of the lost-love ballad it so badly wants to be, it’s becomes anoth-er one of those weepy tunes you listen to out of obligation once (and only once) after a breakup with the not-so-special someone you didn’t like that much to begin with. 
If “Boulevard” was for the one 
you’re glad is gone, “Get Me Right” is for the one that got away: the break-up that was completely your fault, that you can’t stop beating yourself up over. There’s nothing like an oddly pretty, repetitive melody combined with breathy, hurting lyrics alluding to Jesus and sinners to make self-crucifixion all the more satisfying.  It’s 
one of Ending ’s few solid cuts, show-
ing off a little virtuoso on the ’ments and the striking melody of Carrabba singing “ri-i-i-ght” with surprising vocal range.
“I Know About Y ou” is a jaunty 
stalker anthem to soundtrack the vin-dication of having known all along your significant other was cheating. Carrabba’s hyperactive pace makes the song catchy and nearly happy — until you listen to the lyrics and real-ize it’s just a bummer testament to all those fellow paranoid exes out there. 
Just to throw us for a loop, the 
album’s title track tells of a relation-ship that can “still go on, ” even if Carrabba can’t resist throwing in the pessimistic prediction that the worst is still to come. But don’t worry: This optimistic slip-up is balanced by plenty of other faux tragedies for the perfect pity party for you, Ben & Jerry and Dashboard. “ Alter the Ending” is just a faint, dismissable glimmer of hope in a cesspool of pseudo-despair, just right for the dwelling.

utility Lance Curtiss and netting a goal 
from the two-meter mark. 
After the teams exchanged goals, 
the Broncos took advantage of a lucky deflection, extending their advantage to 5-3 with 3:59 left in the half. Santa Clara University found the goal again with just under a minute until half-time, extending the Broncos’ lead to a game-high three scores. 
However, after some quick ball 
movement from the Tritons, Curtiss sank the ball into the corner of the cage to bring the score to 6-4.
UCSD charged out with renewed 
energy in the third quarter: Junior driver Bryce Madsen used an assist from Curtiss to lob the ball cross-cage on the Tritons’ first possession, cut-ting Santa Clara University’s lead to one goal. 
The game remained close through-
out the quarter, both teams match-ing each other goal for goal. With a 
10-9 Bronco advantage and less than 
one minute to play in the third quar-ter, senior two-meter defender Peter Gresham skipped a shot into the goal to tie the match at 10-10.
In addition to his score, Gresham’s 
defense played a key role in the Tritons’ success in the match’s second half.
“We changed to a helping-style 
defense at halftime, which proved to be a significant change, ” Harper said. “It was a different ballgame after that. There was a lot more outside shooting. In the first half, Santa Clara’s two-meter men got the best of us. But in the second half, Peter Gresham outplayed them. The kid never gets down — he’s so positive. ”
The Tritons wasted 
little time getting on the board in the final period of regulation. Following a Santa Clara University kickout on UCSD’s coun-terattack, Harper called a timeout to give the Tritons a full 6-on-5 pos-session. 
Once again, Gresham 
came up big, scoring from the post after a per-fectly placed  pass from 
junior driver Sean Cruz. With 6:58 on the clock, UCSD got its first lead.
The Broncos stormed back, how-
ever, scoring three straight goals over a period of four minutes, taking a 13-11 advantage with 2:33 left in the 
game. 
With just over a minute left, as the 
Tritons’ hopes of victory dwindled, 
Donohoe took advantage of a man-up situation to net a close shot from directly in front of the goal.
Still one goal behind, Donohoe 
once again found himself with the 
ball on a Triton counterattack, and passed to a teammate who was hold-ing position in front of the cage. The ref blew the whistle and held up 
five fingers —indicating a UCSD penalty shot. 
Donohoe sank the five-
meter shot into the lower corner to send the game into overtime. 
With renewed momen-
tum, Madsen scored half-way through the first five-minute overtime period on a thrilling Triton six-on-five opportunity, handing his team the victory.
“Obviously, the team 
was very resilient, ” Harper said. “It was a tough ball-game against a very good team, and we had to scramble to pull that one 
out. It was a great come-
back, and I’m so thrilled for 
our six seniors. And we’re undefeated at home this year, because this is our real home. ”
UCSD will play two exhibition 
games at Canyonview on Nov. 14  —against Sunset and the San Francisco Olympic Club — as they wait  for word 
on their postseason seeding for the 
WWPA Championships.

We know what we will have to do in the spring. If we want to be competitive on a national level, we have to bring the race to our local D-I programs. ”
UCSD’s other boats also battled to 
the finish, but came up slightly short against their competitors. The Tritons’ varsity four-boat placed fourth in its race against the University of San Diego with a time of 24:13. The Toreros’ A-boat bested the Tritons by four minutes, coming in first at 20:38. 
In the novice eight-boat event, 
UCSD finished behind San Diego State University and the University of San Diego, earning times of 27:56 and 28:27, respectively.  
According to Pinkerton, fall regat-
tas such as the San Diego Fall Classic allow the Tritons to better assemble the team. 
“We are working to incorporate 
our incoming freshmen, our return-ing novice rowers and the returning varsity, ” Pinkerton said. “They are all on slightly different points in their technical expertise. In the fall, we have the opportunity to focus on making 
technical improvements that can have profound effects on our speed in the spring. I’ve been deeply impressed by the focus of this year’s team. ”
The Tritons, who are back in action  
on Sat., Nov. 14 for the UCSD College Challenge, are looking to build upon their solid opening performance. The inter-squad regatta will give the Tritons one last chance to finetune before the spring season. 
The event is slated for 7 a.m. at 
Mission Bay, and will conclude the fall schedule for the UCSD women’s crew team.

“We had some really good group-
ing, with our three top runners all running together, ” Garcia said. “We had emphasized the idea of showing heart, and I feel like the men’s team did that. I saw them fight for every inch of that 10K. ”
Conference rival Chico State won 
the meet on the men’s side by plac-ing all five of their scoring runners in the race’s top 20. Alaska Anchorage’s Marko Chesto won the men’s race with a time 30:42. Western Washington and Alaska Anchorage also qualified for the national championships on the men’s side. All seven of the teams that advanced were ranked in the top 25 nationally.
After a slow start in the meet, senior 
Mike Wright picked up the pace and motivated his fellow Tritons to join him in one final push for the season.
“We were somewhat scattered 
when we first started, and our senior Mike brought us together in a tight group, ” Baum said. “It really showed leadership on his part. ”
The Triton men came into the 
meet ranked 10th in the region, but came away in ninth place overall — an improvement they hope to build on next year.
“To make that step is something 
we were pleased with, ” Garcia said. “Stanislaus had a strong one-two punch for their top runners and that was difficult to deal with, but at the end of the day, going from 10th to ninth is something you have to be pleased with. ”

Playing their first home game of the season at Canyonview Aquatic Center, the Tritons turned in one of their most impressive ga mes of the 2009 season. Facing 
the Santa Clara University Broncos, the team rallied dramatically from behind to force an overtime period, where UCSD would cli nch a thrilling 14-13 win.
“We had to 
scramble to pull that one out. It was a great comeback, and I’m so thrilled for our six seniors.”

SEASON LOST IN SAN FRANCISCO FOG

CROSS COUNTRY — Despite a strong per-
formance on Nov. 7 at the NCAA Division-
II West Regional Championships, the UCSD cross-country team closed its season sooner than expected. 
The Tritons travelled to Golden Gate Park 
in San Francisco, Calif., to compete against 25 teams from across the state. The women’s team finished seventh while the men’s team took ninth. The race means a disappointing early end to the season, as both squads failed 
to qualify for the NCAA Division-II National Championships. 
The Tritons showed several outstanding 
individual performances, beginning with junior 
Bre Schofield’s 18th-place finish. Schofield’s time of 21:52 in the 6K course was only 18 seconds 
behind conference champion Vivien Wadeck of 
Cal State Los Angeles, making her the Tritons’ top overall finisher of the day. Sophomore Elena Inouye finished 37th overall with a time of 22:52, besting her 51st-place finish at last year’s regional meet. Senior Marie Schaper, soph-omore Aaryn Kobayashi  and junior Brianna 
Alban also finished strong for the team.
“The women raced well, but we just weren’t 
as fast as some of those elite squads out there, ” 
head coach Nate Garcia said. “But I have to 
appreciate the effort I saw out there, even when it wasn’t going the way we wanted. ”
Three of the top five individual women 
finishers were from the University of Alaska Anchorage’s champion team, which narrow-ly edged out California Collegiate Athletic Association champion Chico State. 
Western Washington University and Seattle 
Pacific University joined Alaska Anchorage and Chico State as qualifiers for the national cham-pionships, which will take place on Nov. 21 in Evansville, Ind. Jessica Pixler of Seattle Pacific broke the tape with a first-place time of 20:08 
— over 30 seconds faster than the second-place 
runner.
On the men’s side, sophomore Jeremy Riley 
led the way for the Tritons with a time of 32:58 in the 10K, which earned him a 35th-place fin-ish. Senior Mike Wright followed close behind in 43rd, coming in at 33:26. Sophomores Alex Corliss and John Svet and junior Eric Baum rounded out the scoring for UCSD’s men — all making their first career appearances at the 
regional meet. 
Despite a disappointing final score, Garcia 
said he saw many positive developments in his 
A disappointing performance 
at regionals cut the 2009 season short; no Tritons will run in the NCAA National Championship.

WOMEN’s CREW — The varsity 
eight boat opened up its rowing sea-son with a second-place finish at the San Diego Fall Classic, held at Mission Bay on Nov. 8. The Tritons raced local rivals and Division-I teams San Diego State University and the University of San Diego at the event, crossing the finish line at 22:41 just behind the first-place Aztecs, who turned in a time of 19:47. 
UCSD’s lineup for the Fall Classic 
consisted of sophomore Lisa Y en at coxswain, senior Jesi Bennett at stroke  with seniors Wanda Chin, Summer Austin and Jamie Bigwood; juniors Denise Kleckner, Courtney Escajeda  and Lynn Nguyen and sophomore Brigitte Ngo-Trinh rounding out the  Triton eight boat.
Starting the season with just three 
returnees from last year’s varsity eight, the Tritons’ performance at the San Diego Fall Classic was a good sign for the team’s upcoming meets.
“Our team is often smaller than 
the competition, and our goal is to outrow them by being a better team and training smarter, ” head coach Pattie Pinkerton said. “This year’s varsity is working very hard at improving, and we are seeing the results on the water. We’ll see the real benefit in the spring when they are more confident with the changes. ”
Crew has both a fall and spring 
season on the quarter system, which has both drawbacks and advantages for the coaches and players.

MEN’S WATER POLO — Playing 
their first game in Canyonview pool since early September, the No. 11 Tritons closed out their regular season with an afternoon to remember. 
Facing off against No. 14 Santa 
Clara University, UCSD junior driver Bryce Madsen scored an overtime goal to earn an exciting come-from-behind 14-13 victory on Nov. 7. 
“It’s a pretty gray day today, but to 
me, it feels like it’s shining, ” head coach Denny Harper said after the game. 
As the final regular-season game 
before the Tritons head to the Western Water-Polo Championships from Nov. 20 to Nov. 22, the win may play as a key factor in seed determinations for the playoffs. 
“The game definitely had confer-
ence implications, ” Harper said. “Had we lost, there would have been an argument for us to be the No. 4 seed. Now, we should be No. 2 — and that’s a big difference there. No one wants to play in the [No. 4 vs. No. 5] game to start the tournament. ”
Following a short ceremony honor-
ing UCSD’s six seniors, the game got underway and the Tritons quickly fell 
behind. Failing to score in the first 
period, the team found itself in a 2-0 hole by the start of the second period. 
Senior two-meter defender Steven 
Donohoe put UCSD on the board early, taking a pass from sophomore Despite losing in the first round of the CCAA conference 
playoffs, the UCSD women’s soccer team will host the 2009 NCAA West Regionals. The Tritons — whose 14-5-1 record earned them a first round bye — will play the winner of Nov. 12’s Seattle Pacific vs. Chico State match. UCSD has faced defending national champion Seattle Pacific three times in the postseason, most recently falling 3-1 in the 2008 regionals. After having played each other twice in the CCAA playoffs, UCSD and Chico State would meet in the NCAA postseason for the first time. The Tritons — who have qualified for the NCAA Tournament 23 out of the last 24 years — look to earn a spot in the national championship game for the first time since winning back-to-back national titles from 2000 to 2001.
