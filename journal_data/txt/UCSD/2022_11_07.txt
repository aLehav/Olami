INSIDE“Following UCSD’s logic, it should 
raise our wages as per market 
rates; however, their proposed 
wage increases in recent contract 
negotiations are nowhere near 
that. UCSD boasts that it has 
among the largest student 
housing inventory in the country, 
but who does this housing serve 
if it is not affordable?”

Conservative Student 
Organization Displays 
Rhetoric Deemed Anti-
Palestinian, Faces Back -

On Nov. 2, an image began 
circulating online which portrays 
Turning Point USA at UC San 
Diego, a conservative student or -
ganization, displaying a poster 
that some students interpreted as 
hate speech against Palestinians. 
/T_he poster was one of numerous 
displayed at Turning Point’s table 
on Library Walk to stand against 
antisemitism. It displays the /f_lag 
of Israel and the /f_lag of Palestine 
side-by-side and reads “Israel 
aims to protect / Terrorists aim to 
kill.” 
A photo of the poster was 
posted to the UCSD subreddit, on 
the popular social media forum 
platform, Reddit, by user u/twit -
terboard. /T_he post was captioned 
“Racist a******s. Almost plainly 
saying Palestinian = terrorist,” 
which then gained traction and 
was later shared on Instagram. 
Turning Point USA, the na -
tional conservative organization 
which aims to provide education 
on college campuses, posted a 
photo of their UCSD table on In -
stagram. 
“In light of recent antisemi -
tism we wanted to make sure 
Turing Point USA at ucsd showed 
their support for Israel and the 
Jewish community,” their post 
read. 
/T_he instance has spurred re -
sponses of hurt and anger due to 
the reception of the graphic and 
its text as racist, hateful speech 
toward Palestinians. 
Summer Ismail, a junior at 
/T_hurgood Marshall College and 
member of Students for Justice in 
Palestine, appreciated that Turn -
ing Point took a stand to con -
demn all forms of antisemitism 
— especially in light of Kanye 
West (now referred to as Ye) and 
his recent antisemitic statements. 
However, she asked the members 
of Turning Point to take down the 
poster due to what she deems rac -
ist, hateful, and harmful rhetoric. 
According to Ismail, a/f_ter she 
said this at their table, the stu -
dents at Turning Point responded 
by saying that Palestine is a “ter -
rorist-funded state – for terrorists, 
by terrorists.” When she informed 
them that she is Palestinian and 
sees the poster as hate speech, a 
student at the table responded: 
“It’s freedom of speech.”
A/f_ter further discussion with 
Ismail, the students at the table 
removed the poster from the UAW STRIKE
UAW Academic Union Workers Overwhelmingly Vote 
to Authorize Strike
By Niloufar Shahbandi /gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
The United Auto Workers 2865 announced 
today, /T_hursday, Nov. 3, that 98% of UAW-
represented workers voted to authorize a 
multi-unit strike by UAW bargaining teams in their 
negotiations for living wages with the University of 
California. A strike could occur as early as Nov. 14, 
depending on the circumstances of negotiations. 
During this strike, academic workers would not per -
form their required duties and instead take part in 
picket lines across UC campuses.
A total of 36,558 total votes were cast in the Strike 
Authorization Vote, held between Oct. 26 to Nov. 2, 
which asked members to vote “Yes” if they wished to 
give the UAW bargaining teams the authority to call 
a strike given justi/f_ied circumstances during their 
negotiations. 
/T_he strike will be in conjunction with the Stu -
dents Researchers United-United Auto Workers, a 
newly-formed union of student researchers across 
the UCs. Voters consisted of academic student em -
ployees, academic researchers, postdocs, and student 
researchers. /T_he length of the strike would vary until 
the UC adheres to the unions’ demands. 
/T_he SAV was called for in response to the UC’s 
“unfair labor practices” some of which include:
- Bypassing the union
- Unilateral changes to workers’ conditions
   without negotiation
- Refusal to provide necessary information for
   negotiations
- Obstructing the bargaining processUAW 2865 states that academic workers have 
/f_iled more than 20 charges with the Public Employ -
ment Relations Board regarding such actions. Unions 
within the UC system have been calling for living 
wages for years, with UC-AFT almost reaching the 
picket lines last year and UAW protesting last year 
for similar concerns.
While the UC does not have the right to terminate 
or discipline workers for partaking in a lawful strike, 
the UC has the right to cease pay for workers during a 
strike. However, UAW members who complete their 
strike duties will be eligible for UAW’s Strike and De -
fense Fund, which amount to $400 per week, in addi -
tion to medical bene/f_its under the circumstances that 
UC withholds healthcare bene/f_its. 
During the voting period, students received mes -
sages from teaching assistants regarding the strike 
and their struggles. Reddit user u\WillBigly posted 
earlier this week an email from their TA urging un -
dergraduate students to learn about the issue and 
stand with academic workers.
In an email sent out, UAW shared that the bar -
gaining teams are meeting on Nov. 3 to discuss their 
next steps.
To learn more about the SAV and the strike, 
please visit the Fair UC Now website.
/T_he UCSD Guardian has contacted UAW 2865 
for a comment and will update the article with their 
response. We will continue to publish updates as this 
story progresses.

See /P.cap/A.cap/L.cap/E.cap/S.cap/T.cap/I.cap/N.cap/E.cap,  page 2UC WORKERSRELEASE THE KRAKEN!
A coalition of students have launched a new cam -
paign, Opportunity for All, alongside a letter ad -
dressed to UC President Michael V. Drake, urging 
him to implement a system to hire undocumented 
students in UC campuses, under the premise and le -
gal review of federal laws which they insist does not 
apply to the UC system. 
/T_he letter asserts that the 1986 law, the Immigra -
tion Reform & Control Act, that made it illegal to 
hire undocumented people knowingly does not men -
tion states, thereby making it inapplicable. Legal ex -
perts undersigning the letter have interpreted this so 
that the law does not bind state government entities 
— including the UC — since it falls out of line with 
past Supreme Court precedents that explicitly men -
tion states in federal law. “Because the University of California is an arm 
of the state, it faces no legal restriction on hiring un -
documented workers. /T_his reading of the 1986 law 
has now been endorsed by [twenty-eight] of the most 
knowledgeable immigration law professors in the 
country,” the letter reads.
/T_he letter has been signed by several prominent 
law professors from UCLA School of Law, UC Berke -
ley School of Law, and Stanford Law.
While it’s unclear whether the UC Regents will 
respond to this proposal, Chair of the UC Board of 
Regents Richard Leib told the Los Angeles Times 
that he is intrigued by the legal proposal, given that 
it is signed by notable scholars, such as UC Berkeley’s 
School of Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. UC Students and Scholars Urge UC to Hire Undocu -
mented Students Without Work Permits

table; seven minutes later, Ismail 
saw a student at the table display 
the poster again.
To her, the spread of anti-Pal -
estinian rhetoric is highly harm -
ful and dangerous, especially 
considering the UCSD communi -
ty’s widespread lack of knowledge 
regarding the nuances of the Pal -
estinian occupation by Israel. She 
anticipates this type of rhetoric 
will reinforce implicit bias against 
Palestinians. 
“As we already know that Pal -
estine-Israel, obviously, is a very, 
very complex issue,” Ismail said. 
“And when it comes to students 
who have little to no knowledge, 
who cannot tell you where Pales -
tine is on the map, seeing and be -
ing approached by these people, 
only to be told that, ‘Hey, this 
nation is dangerous – they’re ter -
rorists.’ [...] Because people have 
these biases, and we don’t know 
how [they’re] going to treat us – 
whether it be faculty members or 
students in the classroom, and 
having that bias and thinking, 
‘/T_his person is a terrorist,’ ‘/T_his 
person can harm me,’ — it’s dan -
gerous to both people.”
Ismail contends that Chancel -
lor Pradeep K. Khosla should hold 
parties accountable and release a 
statement to the UCSD commu -nity — especially to stay consis -
tent with the university’s contin -
ued emphasis on equity, diversity, 
and inclusion. Ismail referenced 
a statement from Khosla on May 
6, 2022 to condemn antisemitism. 
/T_he statement followed an inci -
dent on Israeli Independence Day 
where an Israeli /f_lag was graﬃtied 
with a statement that criticized 
Israel for committing several war 
crimes. 
“We saw in the past how 
swi/f_tly and how quickly he was 
able to send out an email blast to 
something in the past,” she said. 
“I think this should be held to the 
same level ... I hope that some -
thing that blatantly describes Pal -
estinians as terrorists is held to 
that same degree of punishment 
and held accountable so that it 
would never happen again.”
Others on the UCSD subred -
dit have demanded that Chancel -
lor Khosla take steps to address 
this, as well.
“When can we expect the 
chancellor to come out and ad -
monish this racism?” user u/
ChuyUrLord said. 
“Let’s see if our supreme lead -
er sends out an email admonish -
ing this like he did last quarter. 
Highly unlikely tho,” user u/
Broad_Echo3989 said. Other subredditors took issue 
with the social media critiques di -
rected at Turning Point.
“Lmao if you oppose this 
you’re suddenly antisemitic and 
need to be cancelled, gas lighting 
at its /f_inest,” user u/Mordecaibest 
wrote.
One Instagram user con -
demned Turning Point’s methods 
of trying to condemn antisemi -
tism, saying that their lack of ed -
ucation on the Israeli-Palestinian 
con/f_lict is harmful.
“if you genuinely cared about 
the Jewish community you 
wouldn’t have in/f_lammatory 
posters out that just make people 
hate us more,” user @nellyeszer 
said. “Your generalizations are so 
hurtful to us – and please don’t comment on this con/f_lict if you’re 
not educated on it.”
“We need to build bridges, 
rather than to burn them like by 
putting these kinds of harmful 
and hateful posters,” Ismail said. 
“We need to work towards getting 
peace rather than putting up this 
kind of rhetoric on campus.”
“Whether it be a Palestin -
ian, an Israeli, a Jewish student, 
a Black student, or a Latino stu -
dent. Anyone shouldn’t have to 
feel like this or feel like school is a 
dangerous place,” Ismail said.  
  Turning Point USA at UCSD 
was not able to be reached for 
comment.

tinue to report updates to this sto -
ry as it progresses.

“It’s a brand-new novel idea, 
and of course, I would love to do it 
if feasible,” Leib said. “But I want 
to review it closely, so it doesn’t 
have any unintended conse -
quences and doesn’t end up hurt -
ing our undocumented students.”
/T_he letter goes on to list sev -
eral students with undocumented 
status who have either been of -
fered campus positions or in one 
case, attempted to publish a book, 
however have been unable to do 
so. 
/T_he proposal comes amidst 
new challenges to the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
(DACA) last month, with a federal 
appeals court ruling the program 
unlawful. /T_he restrictive limits of 
DACA — which has not accepted 
new applicants since June 2021 
and requires applicants to have 
entered the United States prior to 
June 15, 2007 — have made it so 
that many undocumented people 
remain without the proper per -
mits to work legally.
Jeﬀry Umaña Muñoz, an un -
documented junior UCLA stu -dent, told UCLA Law about the 
lack of options that come with 
being an undocumented student. 
“I turned down a full ride to 
Harvard because, at UCLA, I 
was promised that I was not my 
status, rather, just a student. And 
because of that, UCLA would 
provide me with resources and 
support me holistically,” Muñoz 
said. “/T_he UC has failed to up -
hold that promise every single 
time since I matriculated. /T_hey have not supported me, let alone 
given me an equal opportunity to 
succeed.”
 “Some of the /f_inest students 
in my career have been undocu -
mented students, who have over -
come tremendous obstacles to 
achieve higher education,” Di -
rector of the UCLA Labor Center 
Kent Wong told UCLA Law. “We 
would hire these students today if 
given permission by the Universi -
ty of California. Not only are our students being unfairly treated, 
but the university is also nega -
tively impacted as it excludes the 
powerful work and input from 
thousands of undocumented stu -
dents across its campuses.”
/T_he UC Regents have de -
fended undocumented students 
before when they /f_iled a lawsuit 
against the Department of Home -
land Security to prevent the dis -
solution of DACA, in which they 
won the case in front of the Su -
A.S. Council Week 5 and 6: Budgets for ASCE and Sun

Week 5
During their meeting on Oct. 
26, the A.S. Council listened to 
presentations about the proposed 
budgets for various student orga -
nizations, including KSDT Radio, 
Oﬃce of Concerts and Events 
(ASCE), as well as budgeting for 
Sun God Festival. /T_hey also made 
decisions about the total budget 
for the Oﬃce of Communications
Lili Follett, the manager of 
KSDT Radio, proposed their 
2022-2023 budget. /T_he station 
would like to increase their sti -pends, from $80 to $100 per week, 
in order to compete with other 
college radio stations. /T_he sti -
pends would help them attract 
more talent. 
Next, CCO Kharrylle Rosa -
rio sponsored a special presen -
tation regarding the ASCE Fall 
Revise Budget. /T_hey would like 
to increase the Bear Garden Se -
nior Send-Oﬀ Line Item, which 
would provide for more games, 
food, free merchandise, and more 
activities to help celebrate UCSD 
graduates. /T_hey would also like 
to increase the budget for the 
Sun God Festival from $813,000 
to $913,000 due to in/f_lation, sup -ply chain challenges, and wage 
increases. In particular, the cost 
of production, safety, and secu -
rity have largely increased from 
2019-2022. In the Sun God Festi -
val 2022 feedback survey, which 
received more than 3,800 re -
sponses, many students claimed 
they would like to see changes in 
the musical performances and the 
food vendors. 
/T_hen, Rosario sponsored the 
presentation regarding the Oﬃce 
of Communications 2022-2023 
budget. /T_he Oﬃce of the Chief 
Communication Oﬃcer proposed 
a total budget of $170,250; ASCE 
proposed a budget of  $1,475,000; Oﬃce of Spirit and Athletics pro -
posed $177,500; the Oﬃce of Food 
and Housing Resources proposed 
$49,000; the Oﬃce of Equity, Di -
versity, and Inclusion proposed 
$100,400.
Week 6
During their meeting on Nov. 
2, the A.S. Council listened to 
special presentations about on-
campus housing and food.
First, a special presentation 
on Housing, Dining, Hospital -
ity sponsored by A.S. President 
Sky Yang was introduced. UCSD 
currently has 18,022 beds on 
campus today and ranks third in the nation for student hous -
ing inventory. With the opening 
of the /T_heater District Living 
and Learning Neighborhood in 
Fall 2023, UCSD will once again 
oﬀer a two-year undergraduate 
on-campus housing guarantee. 
/T_he /T_heater District Living and 
Learning Neighborhood will 
also be the future home for 2,000 
undergraduate residents when 
it opens in Fall 2023 and oﬀer 
more than 1,300 parking spots. 
/T_he Pepper Canyon West Living 
and Learning Neighborhood will 
provide housing for transfer and preme Court.

UCSD Should Pursue Researcher Welfare, not 
Vanity Projects
/T_his article is a guest sub -
mission from Avaneesh Narla, 
a Ph.D. candidate from the 
UCSD Physics Department.
Two weeks ago, I attended a 
concert by the San Diego Sym -
phony at the new Epstein Family 
Amphitheatre on campus. /T_he 
performances were terri/f_ic, and 
fortunately, my home’s proxim -
ity to the venue allowed me to 
attend. But most students and 
researchers don’t have access to 
attend such events as they have 
been priced out of housing in 
the University City area, and ex -
pensive projects, such as the Am -
phitheatre, should be revealed 
for what they truly are: vanity 
projects by administrators that 
are seeking to leave a legacy and 
mingle with local politicians. 
Students and researchers at UC 
San Diego don’t need white el -
ephants — we need living wages 
and aﬀordable housing. If admin -
istrators want to leave a legacy, I 
urge them, before it’s too late, to 
pursue living conditions for the 
researchers and educators that 
are working overtime to make 
UCSD a leading university, rath -er than /f_lashy buildings that its 
own community cannot access.
/T_he housing crisis in Univer -
sity City is well-documented and 
a constantly-lived struggle for 
most students and researchers 
at UCSD. Chancellor Pradeep K. 
Khosla cites market forces and 
the pandemic for such sharp in -
creases in rent. But UCSD is the 
driving market force as it contin -
ues to increase enrollment rap -
idly, and pledging to keep hous -
ing 20% below market rate means 
nothing if the market rate is way 
beyond researchers’ ability to pay. 
Following UCSD’s logic, it should 
raise our wages as per market 
rates; however, their proposed 
wage increases in recent contract 
negotiations are nowhere near 
that. UCSD boasts that it has 
among the largest student hous -
ing inventory in the country, but 
who does this housing serve if it 
is not aﬀordable? UCSD wants 
to increase on-campus hous -
ing by at least 10,000 beds by 
2035, yet if it continues to grow 
at 4% as it has over the last de -
cade, it will have added almost 
30,000 more students by then.
UCSD states that it is also 
investing in oﬀ-campus housing 
for staﬀ and faculty. However, 
the recently acquired Frame -
work Apartments — which can By Avaneesh NARLA
/gid00008/gid00022/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019be more than an hour’s commute 
from campus, depending on 
method of transportation and the 
time of day — are not as aﬀord -
able as housing on campus. At 
Framework, UCSD is charging a 
minimum of $2,100 plus utilities 
for a 358 sq. /f_t. studio apartment. 
/T_his is more than many student 
researchers at UCSD make (and 
perplexingly, the same as the 
market rate for a 650 sq. /f_t apart -
ment in the adjoining complex). 
Further, the apartments are in a 
neighborhood with exploding 
homelessness rates due to the pre -
vailing lack of aﬀordable hous -
ing. I couldn’t /f_ind any data on 
responses to a survey conducted 
by UCSD to gauge interest in the 
project, but I fail to understand 
who would be able and interest -
ed in paying so much for such a 
small space so far from campus. 
Nonetheless, if UCSD believes 
that this is the appropriate price 
for barely-adequate housing 
along the trolley line, it believes 
that its researchers cannot af -
ford to live along the trolley line.
UCSD states that it will use 
a $100 million grant from the 
Higher Education Student Hous -
ing Grant Program to lower rates 
up to 55% below market for 1,100 
low-income California resident 
students. /T_his is too little, too late. /T_he inability of UCSD to commit 
to tying housing rates to the wages 
it pays its workers, even for a mi -
nuscule number of low-income 
Californians, is a testimony to its 
lack of commitment to housing, 
while it builds /f_lashier buildings 
on campus. UCSD is concerned 
only with market rates because it 
does not care about aﬀordability 
but about recovering funds from 
students and researchers to fund 
its unwarranted growth and van -
ity projects. Living near campus 
is now inaccessible to students 
from low-income backgrounds, 
resulting in lower participation in 
classes, student groups, and com -
munity events. /T_his is a de-facto 
form of economic (and ethnic/
racial) discrimination. Further, 
the lack of aﬀordable housing 
near campus most impacts inter -
national students and researchers 
who do not have credit scores, 
bank accounts, or driver’s licens -
es when they arrive in this coun -
try and o/f_ten live in cramped 
quarters far from campus. As a 
result, students and research -
ers who cannot aﬀord to live in 
San Diego are not enrolling at 
UCSD. /T_his is the product of the 
loss of reputation and status that 
UCSD currently has, not the lack 
of fancier buildings on campus.
In negotiating our new em -
ployment contracts, academic 
workers have made concrete pro -
posals to address housing insecu -
rity at UCSD. But the university 
administration has continuously 
broken the law by circumvent -
ing the bargaining process, mak -
ing unilateral changes, and re -
fusing to bargain in good faith. 
/T_hese tactics are preventing us 
from reaching agreements for 
fair wages and working condi -
tions. Last week, 35,655 academic 
workers (97.53% of those who 
voted, and 76% of the 48,000 
eligible) across the UC voted to 
authorize our Bargaining Teams 
to call a strike; unless the UC 
negotiates fairly to ensure we 
can live and work with dignity, 
we will not work. On /T_hursday, 
the Bargaining Teams decided 
that circumstances, based on the 
pending unfair labor practice 
charges, justi/f_ied strikes in each 
unit which will begin on Nov. 14. 
/T_his strike will be historic, as it 
will include three of the largest 
unions in the UC, but none of us 
will be striking with pleasure. We 
love our research and teaching 
and want to continue doing so. 
But if UC won’t stop its unlawful 
conduct, we will have no choice.

/T_he YouTuber has already hit 
Record when they reach for the 
/f_irst crab leg seasoned in Hot 
Cheeto dust and slather it with 
nacho cheese. /T_hey either choose 
to talk to their camera in a con -
versational way or say nothing 
and let the crab leg speak for it -
self. Some people call this eating 
process satisfying, with some 
attributing the reason behind 
watching such videos to ASMR 
or a pleasurable “brain tingle.” 
Others call this recorded way of 
eating gratuitous and unneces -
sary — a pathway to disordered 
eating or unhealthy habits.
/T_he video, nonetheless, will 
be posted with a red and yellow 
palette (colors known to evoke 
hunger) and jubilant or tearful 
expressions galore on YouTube. 
It will be pitted against doz -
ens of other top-name muk -
bangers, as well as health and 
social norms, no longer just a way 
for audience members to ward oﬀ 
loneliness or occupy their time 
with cheap thrills. /T_he video, in 
other words, is not just mealtime 
at face value but a potential ticket 
to accessing who the “performer” 
might be, whether they declare it 
or not.
Mukbangs — a combination 
of “eating” or “muk” in “muk-
ja” (let’s eat) and “broadcast” or 
“bang” in “bang-song”(broadcast 
room) — began in Korea by those 
keen on utilizing live video for -
matting around dinnertime to 
eat large amounts of food with 
others and engage in camarade -
rie. /T_he live formatting started 
on the platform AfreecaTV and 
Twitch, with commenters being 
able to direct the person eating, 
or the “performer,” to move a 
certain way or eat one particular 
food. 
/T_his is notably prominent in 
Korea, where many youths be -
gan broadcasting their meals and 
responding to live chats due to 
the loneliness of eating by them -
selves when eating can easily be a 
shared experience. Yet, it was not 
usually a time to be vulnerable about their personal lives as much 
as it was a time to display the food 
and how it was being consumed 
— or how much of it.
Mukbangs are still unfamiliar 
to some on YouTube, with these 
videos from American Youtu -
bers emerging just a few years ago 
and knowledge of it in the U.S. 
growing from 2015 due to a Fine 
Brothers Entertainment reac -
tion video on Korean mukbangs. 
Even today, many YouTubers who 
invest in the mukbang scene pro -
nounce the word “mook-bang,” 
a humorous indication of how 
something so integral such as the 
term itself can easily lose its roots 
as the concept becomes more 
widely known. 
YouTubers like Nikocado Av -
ocado — who calls his fans “little 
sloths” — or Trisha Paytas are just 
a few of the many mukbangers on 
YouTube who engage in storytell -
ing or sharing personal stories to 
build a more personal dynamic 
with their audience; they are 
not just consumers of food but a 
friend to sit with. If a mukbanger 
is especially popular, they can 
use this occupation as a reliable 
source of income with added sta -
bility from ads and sponsorships.
/T_he literature behind why 
individuals watch mukbangs is 
not plentiful, but according to 
an article from the International 
Journal of Mental Health and Ad -
diction, authors Kagan Kircabu -
run et al. have detailed that it can 
ful/f_ill psychological needs such as 
loneliness as well as vicarious eat -
ing pleasure.  
But recently, mukbangs have 
manifested on YouTube as a more 
notorious, harmful means: one 
of addiction and insatiable ap -
petites. Indeed, the food that gets 
the most views is not a Greek sal -
ad but rather a realm of calorie-
dense meals like instant noodles 
or other usually accessible fried 
foods and fast food like Taco Bell 
or Jollibee’s.
Nicholas Perry — better 
known as Nikocado Avocado  — 
is a mukbanger known for being 
an amalgamation of extremes, 
from his start in veganism to 
more carnal appetites a/f_ter col -
lege and his recent amassing of a huge following. His presence on 
YouTube has transitioned into 
status as a performer and o/f_ten 
disregards what he might be ex -
periencing behind the scenes.
On his third YouTube chan -
nel, he posted a video last month 
titled “Celebrating our 700 pound 
Milestone…. McDonald’s Muk -
bang,” referring to him and his 
on-and-oﬀ husband’s apparent 
increase in weight; there was 
notably an overall nonchalance 
about the situation. /T_his is not 
new. In some videos, he engages 
in physical and verbal altercations 
with his husband, Orlin Home, 
while eating large amounts of 
food. Yet, the behavior continues 
without loss to his channels, and 
the repetitive nature of this has 
resulted in overwhelmingly nega -
tive but unsurprised feedback or 
even tepid disinterest from audi -
ence members.
Perry currently has /f_ive You -
Tube channels with views helping 
his videos gain traction regard -
less; furthermore, he is on Cameo 
and Patreon where one can pay 
$149 for a personalized video of 
about /f_ive minutes and $16 per 
month for All-Access for more 
personal content respectively. His 
Cameo holds an almost 5-star 
rating with more than seven hun -
dred satis/f_ied reviews. 
/T_he way sympathy can mani -
fest when one thinks much pain 
is self-directed is of murky terri -
tory. Food addiction, for one, is 
undeniably real, with the with -
drawal eﬀects as present as drug 
withdrawal. But many individu -
als have expressed disgust or 
even dismay, with some express -
ing their gratitude for the subtle 
nudges from these videos to eat 
in a more healthy manner or feel 
better about themselves or their 
own bodies. Further, many You -
Tube comments state that the 
“real fans” are the ones express -
ing their anger or disapproval of 
his actions, while others encour -
age his behavior when they praise 
him.
According to a study in the 
Health Informatics Journal by Ji -
hye Lee et al., videos that depict 
overeating garner a larger audi -
ence. /T_his also applies to spicy food or food with time limits. As 
cyclical as it sounds, there is con -
/f_irmation, too, of the mukbanger 
giving in to the viewers’ desires. 
In other words, despite the criti -
cism, there are still viewers help -
lessly curious or intrigued to 
watch the videos they may end up 
critiquing. /T_hese views encourage 
the mukbanger to continue mak -
ing this content.
Additionally, Kircaburun et 
al. state that recreationally watch -
ing mukbangs is not as pressing 
as frequently watching mukbangs 
at a problematic level, which en -
tails watching as a form of escap -
ism from real-life situations. /T_his 
can be a gateway to internet ad -
diction.
Mukbang videos also carry 
moral weight to some who scru -
tinize mukbangers and see their 
way of eating as an avenue for 
gauging the type of individual 
they are. For instance, in early 
2019, Veronica Wang, a YouTu -
ber whose content focused par -
ticularly on mukbangs, entered a 
scene of controversy and involve -
ment with a lawyer, a/f_ter being 
dubbed a YouTuber unable to take 
criticism when jabs were made at 
her in some edited videos. She re -
sponded with a copyright strike 
against the small YouTube ac -
count Shookbang and received a 
barrage of hate and dismay at her 
actions, only to be a more em -
braced YouTuber today despite 
that fall from grace.
Some accounts on YouTube 
have devoted their editing skills 
to creating compilation videos 
making jabs at mukbangers, 
which sometimes gain so much 
traction that some /f_ind out who 
the subject of entertainment is 
through the videos through these 
small, anonymous creators. /T_he 
videos exaggerate facial expres -
sions or words and tease that the 
mukbanger is eating too vora -
ciously or greedily. As /f_lippant as 
the videos seem in weight, these 
mukbangers are usually not too 
well-liked.

very much loved by ravenous fans and contrastingly a way for more dubious audience members to gauge the moral -
ity of and who or what the mukbanger represents — rather than just a conduit to see someone consume food. 
/gid00034/gid00081/gid00083/gid00001/gid00065/gid00088/gid00001/gid00047/gid00072/gid00066/gid00071/gid00078/gid00075/gid00064/gid00082/gid00001/gid00051/gid00068/gid00070/gid00075/gid00072/gid00001/gid00069/gid00078/gid00081/gid00001/gid00053/gid00071/gid00068/gid00001/gid00054/gid00036/gid00052/gid00037/gid00001/gid00040/gid00084/gid00064/gid00081/gid00067/gid00072/gid00064/gid00077/gid00015viduals praise and defend due to 
her past controversial comments 
against communities of color. 
/T_hese critical video compilations 
of her eating manners draw in 
hundreds of thousands of viewers 
who take note of the way she eats 
and how unappetizing her food 
seems. 
Both of these YouTubers have 
been open about their lives in 
their mukbang videos.
/T_hus, the avenues for vul -
nerability that mukbangs have 
opened up for YouTubers to delve 
into their lives beyond food also 
have oddly created a sense of dis -
connect in which the food itself 
or how a meal is being consumed 
becomes the individual. In other 
words, if mukbangs still aren’t 
curated aesthetically such as 
adhering to the red-and-yellow-
food-theme or the mukbangers 
are embroiled in personal issues 
outside of eating videos, they 
garner negative reception from 
their audience. /T_hey may face cri -
tique against themselves, as well 
as their ability to do mukbangs 
(such as comments that they eat 
too loudly or have unappealing 
food). Moreover, many com -
menters and viewers support the 
critique. 
Still, as Lee et al. stated, the 
types of foods and the manner of 
eating might be a big factor in dis -
cerning the impact of mukbangs. 
Viewership increases when eat -
ing is voracious and appetites are 
large — all the things that also 
receive negative attention.
Mukbangs on YouTube still 
serve as a means to bridge the gap 
between mukbanger and audi -
ence members. Many of the vid -
eos dive into storytelling, shar -
ing, and more. 
Still, this comes with the price 
of potentially seeing them beyond 
the food and even attributing cer -
tain /f_laws in how they perform as 
a mukbanger to their character. 
/T_his also comes with mindless 
consumptions out of mild curios -
ity or intrigue without genuinely 
caring about the performer. ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT/C.cap/O.cap/N.cap/T.cap/A.cap/C.cap/T.cap /T.cap/H.cap/E.cap /E.cap/D.cap/I.cap/T.cap/O.cap/R.cap

It’s been 10 years since Carly 
Rae Jepsen’s hit-/f_illed sophomore 
album, “Kiss,” propelled the Ca -
nadian artist into the conscious -
ness of every Millenial and Gen 
Z pop fan. She’d already had 
moderate success in her musical 
career pre-”Kiss,” placing third 
on “Canadian Idol” in 2007, but 
it was her breakout single “Call 
Me Maybe” that made her a pop 
phenomenon. In the decade since 
Jepsen’s big break, she’s had a 
healthy number of chart-toppers 
(including the one lip-synced by 
Tom Hanks), but for those who 
haven’t kept up with her career, 
it may come as a surprise that she 
has just released her sixth studio 
album. /T_hat’s right — Jepsen has 
kept herself busy over the years, 
producing a steady output of bub -
blegum- and dance-pop tracks. 
Her latest project, “/T_he Loneli -
est Time,” delivers everything a 
CRJ fan could want: whimsical 
relationship musings, dance -
able beats, and a dreamy, candy-
coated aesthetic that makes cer -
tain songs feel like they’re pulled 
straight from a sunny, summer-
love romance movie.
Of course, it’s not entirely 
more of the same from Jepsen. /T_he new album shows the pop 
princess pushing her boundaries 
sonically and oﬀering more than 
a few surprises along the way. A 
big one is the titular track, “/T_he 
Loneliest Time,” featuring fellow 
Canadian artist Rufus Wain -
wright. Despite what its name 
would suggest, this is no dis -
mal, wallowing song. Rather, it’s 
an upbeat, disco-inspired track 
about the desire to reignite an 
un/f_inished love story a/f_ter having

ily the best track on the album — 
and certainly the most fun.
/T_he disco in/f_luence is woven 
into a few other tracks, but bub -
blegum-, dance-, and synth-pop 
reign supreme. Jepsen culls the 
in/f_luences of various decades to 
make the album’s 13 tracks stand 
out from her previous oeuvre. 
Album opener “Surrender My 
Heart” channels the ‘80s, even 
having a very “In /T_he Air Tonight” 
drum moment before jumping 
into its catchy chorus. Synth-in -

“Sideways” and “Far Away” take 
on a slightly more R&B /f_lavor, the 
former track featuring that spark -
ly sound that noughties artists of 
that genre loved to overuse. Single 
“Western Wind” is a reminder of 
Jepsen’s folk-inspired /f_irst album, 
while the cheekily-titled ”Go Find 
Yourself or Whatever” could pass 
for a coﬀee shop acoustic tune. 
Despite the variety of in/f_luences, 
however, many of the tracks fail 
to move from interesting to re -
markable. Jepsen deserves props 
for trying out diﬀerent sounds, 
but her hesitance to move past a 
surface-level homage leaves the 
decade-dabbling feeling unmem -
orable.
On the album’s stronger tracks, 
the pop veteran reminds us of her 
lyricism’s power to convey famil -
iar feelings in creative ways (like 
the ever-iconic verse in “Call Me 
Maybe” telling a newfound crush 
“Before you came into my life/ I 
missed you so bad”). Humorous 
track “Beach House’’ chronicles 
dates gone wrong, with Jepsen 
musing, “I’ve been on this ride / 
/T_his rollercoaster’s a carousel / 
And I’m getting nowhere.” Male 
vocalists pipe in with lines remi -
niscent of the typical Tinder hor -
ror story: “I’ve got a lake house in 
Canada / And I’m probably gonna harvest your organs,” they sing 
nonchalantly. On the breakup-
inspired “Talking To Yourself,” 
Jepsen asks, “Do you talk to me 
when you’re talking to yourself?,” 
echoing the relatable paradox of 
wanting someone you’re done 
with to be thinking of you. Je -
psen also has a few duds, from 
the distracting use of the word 
“skipper” in “Bad /T_hing Twice” to 
the cliche metaphors that /f_ill out 
sappy song “So Nice.” Luckily, the 
lyrical fumbles are outnumbered 
by quotable lines and sassy quips 
that show Jepsen hasn’t lost her 
touch.
It’s understandable that a 
sixth album would feature exper -
imentation. How else could Jep -
sen keep things fresh or display her growth as an artist? Longtime 
and returning listeners will surely 
appreciate her new, multi-genre 
era for its novelty. Jepsen knows 
how to make solid pop tunes, even 
if they don’t quite rise to the viral, 
chart-topping status of her ear -
lier work. Despite its quiet debut 
(on the same day as Taylor Swi/f_t’s 
“Midnights,” unfortunately), “/T_he 
Loneliest Time” proves Jepsen is 
still an artist worth paying atten -
tion to — especially if you’re a ‘10s 
pop fan. For those who have been 
out of the loop with Jepsen post-
”Kiss,” this album might make 
you realize what’s been missing 
from your playlist all these years. By Bailey Bujnosek

“I’m Glad My Mom Died” 
“I’m Glad My Mom Died” sold out within the /f_irst 24 hours of its release on Aug. 9 at 
numerous bookstores and online sellers across the country. It wasn’t until a month a/f_ter 
its release that I was able to /f_ind a copy on Amazon, which took a painstakingly long time 
to arrive. Yet, once I picked it up, I was unable to put it down. Jennette McCurdy’s mem -
oir is a whirlwind of emotions, ranging from funny to heartbreaking as she recounts her 
life in the entertainment industry and the complicated relationship she had with her late 
mother. Many people my age were eager to read this because many of us grew up watch -
ing McCurdy as Sam Puckett on the hit Nickelodeon show “iCarly.” 
I watched “iCarly” almost every day when I was a kid, and Sam was one of my favor -
ite characters. So years later, when I found out that McCurdy didn’t even like acting, I 
was confused because she portrayed Sam’s character so well. I couldn’t understand how 
someone so famous could hate acting. Reading her memoir not only answered this ques -
tion but also exposed me to the hidden dangers in the entertainment industry, especially 
for kids. 
In her memoir, McCurdy talks about her days working for Nickelodeon on “iCarly” 
and its spinoﬀ “Sam & Cat.” She makes many references to a man called “/T_he Creator,” 
who we all assume to be Dan Schneider, the creator of multiple hit Nickelodeon shows 
including “iCarly,” “Victorious,” “All /T_hat,” “Drake & Josh,” and others. In 2021, the New 
York Post reported that Schneider was /f_ired from Nickelodeon for his mistreatment of his 
colleagues and his violent behavior. McCurdy describes multiple experiences with him 
as uncomfortable. She describes one instance where he tried to make her drink alcohol 
when she was underage, and another where he had her try on bikinis a/f_ter she expressed 
she didn’t want to. She also details her experience /f_ilming “iCarly” and how she was very 
miserable and denied the opportunity to direct an episode. /T_he majority of the book, 
however, focuses on the abuse and trauma she faced from her mother Debra, who died 
back in 2013. Her mother encouraged her eating disorder and forced McCurdy into an 
acting career she didn’t want to pursue. Reading her account made me sympathize with 
her — the lost childhood experiences and all the pain that comes with it. It also made me Kamiah Johnson  /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
think about how the entertainment industry treats child actors — with little to no regard 
for their mental health and well-being. 
Disney Channel, Nickelodeon Studios, and Cartoon Network have dominated chil -
dren’s television for over 20 years. I and many others my age loved watching their shows 
as children but had no idea of the hardships child actors were put through for the sake 
of our entertainment. McCurdy details how she never had a moment of peace due to 
her rise in fame; she couldn’t go out into the world without someone recognizing her as 
Sam Puckett, resulting in her having major anxiety in public settings and having to wear 
wigs to her favorite places like Disneyland. McCurdy’s memoir is a look into how toxic 
the entertainment industry can be and shines a light on the lasting eﬀects it can have on 
those involved. I think that this is one of the most important aspects of this book: expos -
ing the dangers of the industry to those who aren’t aware of it. Although some come out 
of childhood stardom relatively unscathed, many others don’t. While McCurdy doesn’t 
give any possible solutions to Hollywood’s misdoings, it’s not her job to do so. She made 
it out alive, and I think her telling her story is enough to provoke important discussions. 
It’s important to hear these stories and treat them with the utmost care and respect they 
deserve. 
/T_he audience and critical reception “I’m Glad My Mom Died” received was tremen -
dous. Not only did it garner amazing reviews, but it also received an outpour of love from 
both old fans of “iCarly” and her newer supporters. McCurdy has seen what her memoir 
has meant to people and commented on it in an interview with Forbes saying, “I’m so 
grateful for the emotional connection people seem to be having with this book. I couldn’t 
have predicted it to resonate with so many.” “I’m Glad my Mom Died” is an insanely hon -
est and true insight into the dangers of child stardom and a lesson in how to come out on 
top despite the hardships we might face. I love to see that Jenette McCurdy is reveling in 
her New York Times Bestseller, and I continue to support her endeavors in her writing 
and directing career.

painfully funny story of McCurdy’s childhood, but also encourages us to think 
about the dangers that the entertainment industry poses to children.PHOTO ESSAY/C.cap/O.cap/N.cap/T.cap/A.cap/C.cap/T.cap /T.cap/H.cap/E.cap /E.cap/D.cap/I.cap/T.cap/O.cap/R.cap /P.cap/H.cap/O.cap/T.cap/O.cap/G.cap/R.cap/A.cap/P.cap/H.cap/E.cap/R.cap

BRADLEY BEGGS
Release the Kraken! (and where to Do It) 
Let’s not play coy. We all know 
that feeling you get in your belly 
that tells you it’s time to unload 
some cargo, drop the kids oﬀ at 
the pool, or make a fudge pop. 
Whatever you call it, it’s a funda -
mental part of each of our daily 
routines, and while it is a natural 
process, mounting the big white 
can is an activity which can feel 
pretty shameful. /T_hus, I think I 
speak for the majority of us when 
I say that the ideal place for drop -
ping that daily dookie is in the 
privacy of one’s own home. Un -
fortunately, fate o/f_ten has other 
plans for us, and nature does not 
discriminate when, nor where, it 
decides to call. 
As full time students, many 
of us /f_ind ourselves on campus 
more o/f_ten than at home. Ris -
ing at 9 a.m. with classes until 7 
p.m., there’s a large chunk of time 
when the dreaded school poop is 
frankly inevitable. /T_he fudge fac -
tory brews throughout our slum -
ber and by 11 a.m. section, it’s 
ready to push out some product. 
When that signal hits, it’s a race to 
decide what bathroom will create 
the best ambience needed to wrap 
the perfect butt burrito. 
I consider myself a seasoned 
vet when it comes to pooping at 
school, a bathroom connoisseur, 
if you will. Maybe you question 
my credibility when I say this, but 
rest assured I do not throw those 
terms around lightly. My lactose 
intolerance in conjunction with 
my aﬃnity for dairy means I tend 
to spend more time on the toilet 
than the average joe. Additional -
ly, I’m not taking a trip to the por -
celain bank for a quick deposit — 
I’m there to make a transaction. 
When I enter a bathroom, I’m not 
walking in there as a potty goer, 
I’m walking in there as a certi/f_ied 
critic. I’m looking to be wooed. 
I’ve realized not everyone is 
a bathroom enthusiast like me, 
but I know that at some point or 
another, most of us will have to 
log an entry on campus. So I’ve 
decided to /f_inally put my knowl -
edge to good use and provide 
some poor souls with a bit of UC 
San Diego bathroom insight. So 
for those of you who are deciding 
where to drop your next dookie 
during your break between class -
es, take a look at some of the toi -
lets I’ve used throughout my time 
as a Triton. 
Eventually I hope to give 
you a more comprehensive list, 
but there’s a lot of toilets to get through, and frankly there’s not 
enough poops in the day. Ad -
ditionally, my knowledge will be 
limited to women’s bathrooms, 
but hopefully there’s some shared 
applicability that can help inform 
anyone’s decision on where their 
next poo shall occur. 
So here’s my ranking and re -
views on 10 of the bathrooms that 
I’ve used here on campus, ranked 
worst to best. Remember, this list 
is still subject to change, so if you 
have any toilets that you feel need 
to be talked about, make sure to 
drop me a tip so that I can be sure 
to provide you with the most ac -
curate and up to date reporting on 
all your bathroom needs. 
10. Geisel Library-6th Floor 
Coming in at number 10 is 
hands down going to be the sixth 
/f_loor bathrooms located in Geisel 
Library. I’ d heard rumors about 
the inadequacy of the library 
toilets, and while I didn’t be -
lieve them at /f_irst, the sixth /f_loor 
toilets really proved me wrong. 
While its recent renovations were 
evident, it’s a small and awkward 
space with room for only two tiny 
stalls and a couple of sinks whose 
placement feels like an accident. 
Beyond that, the air inside feels 
warm and moist, conditions that 
are far from ideal when trying to 
pinch a loaf. /T_he toilet seats were 
dirty, with remnants of another’s 
deposit smeared across the seat. 
I’ll admit this is probably not the 
bathroom’s constant state, but this 
initial impression will de/f_initely 
deter me from revisiting this toilet 
anytime soon. 
9. Pines Bathroom
I hate to do this, but that bath -
room by M.O.M. ’s Cafe in Pines 
was not dressed to impress. As one 
of the older bathrooms I’ve en -
countered, it’s automatically going 
to feel a bit more dingy than some 
other establishments. But on top 
of the aesthetic shortcomings, the 
heat in there is really unbearable, 
the /f_lush is not powerful, and the 
foot traﬃc in and out is far greater 
than that bathroom is realistically 
equipped to handle. 
8. Taco Villa Toilet 
While I’ll admit that the Taco 
Villa toilet is in a prime location, 
located by the Old Student Center 
and on my daily route from the 
bus stop to /T_hurgood Marshall 
College, it is far from my favorite 
bathroom. It’s relatively large and 
not too old or dingy, but once 
again the temperature is all wrong 
if you’re trying to build a dookie 
castle. During a particularly stress -
ful trip to the bathroom, I felt the 
need to rip oﬀ my sweatshirt and 
throw it on my bag which hung on the door. Unfortunately, I lack 
the coordination required and my 
sweater fell to the /f_ilthy tile /f_loor. 
Since then, I’ve been convinced 
that the Taco Villa Toilet may be 
cursed. 
7. Seventh Mail Room 
I am a proud Seventh College 
student and was fortunate enough 
to live my /f_irst two years in the 
Seventh College Neighborhood. 
It’s an area I am familiar with and 
if it weren’t so far from central 
campus I would have its bathroom 
ranked much higher on this list. 
Since moving oﬀ campus, I’ve re -
alized there is little reason I visit 
my old stomping grounds, but I 
nonetheless have to give a little 
shout out to my tried and true 
on-campus toilet. Located on the 
/f_irst /f_loor in the Seventh College 
Mail Room, the bathroom is quiet, 
clean, and feels very private. Take 
it from me, it’s a go-to if you ever 
/f_ind yourself in the neighborhood. 
6. Center Hall 
Look, any bathroom that 
makes me trek up stairs to use 
it is automatically docked some 
points, but Center Hall is a prime 
location, one that is realistically 
the only option if you gotta go 
while seated in this lecture hall. 
I have a bit of a biased perspec -
tive on it as I’ve only dared to try 
it on a weekend. I’ll say it wasn’t 
too shabby, but during the week 
it would be far from preferred. 
I’ve noticed the door is o/f_ten le/f_t  
propped open during the week, an 
absolute outrage in my opinion. 
Not to mention how busy it gets, 
meaning there really is no privacy 
in Center Hall. 
5. Audrey’s Bathroom (Geisel 
Library) 
Audrey’s Cafe in Geisel makes 
one mean chai tea latte, but when 
it comes to busting a grumpy, they 
are absolute slackers. /T_he toilet by 
Audrey’s is consistently swarmed 
with people, something I guess 
you could expect given how con -
stantly busy that area is. It’ll do the 
trick, but never would I consider 
it my /f_irst choice. /T_here’s too many 
people and a part of me fears that 
everyone will know who did it if a 
stink bomb gets dropped. 
4. Cafe V’s Porcelain Palace 
Just like for the Seventh mail -
room, I would really like to leave a 
higher ranking on this bathroom, 
but its distance from the main 
campus makes it less than ideal. 
Located outside Cafe Ventanas in 
Eleanor Roosevelt College, this 
bathroom is the closest I’ve seen to 
absolute perfection. It’s clean and 
fresh inside, always feeling like it 
hasn’t been used but was scrubbed 
down recently anyways. Any hesi -tation you may feel about pooping 
in public completely disappears 
when you enter, what I’ d consider, 
a pooper’s paradise. Some may 
feel that the lighting is a bit darker 
than one may prefer, but it can be 
a great way to get into the zone. 
Not to mention the absolute soli -
tude that you can achieve when in 
this fortress of solitude. 
3. /T_he Seuss Room (Geisel Li -
brary) 
Since I started at UCSD, the 
Seuss Room has been coming in 
clutch every time I’m studying and 
I feel a torpedo launch is impend -
ing. It’s a room that I think most 
people are not aware of, thus the 
bathroom is typically uninhab -
ited. Although, since I typically do 
my studying in the Seuss Room, 
I’ve noticed an increase in foot 
traﬃc towards that bathroom. It’s 
losing some of its peacefulness, 
but I maintain it is a solid spot for 
a toilet run. Recently though, the 
area has been closed oﬀ for vot -
ing, a fact which has been a real 
inconvenience for me and the root 
of some irritation. Nonetheless, 
as long as it opens back up, try to 
make a trip over there next time 
you feel a trip to the bathroom is 
due. 
2. Peterson Hall 
I know, I know, ranking this 
bathroom so high is quite a con -
troversial decision. It hasn’t gained 
much praise by the general public 
and nothing about it seems that 
great. But I’ve gotta tell you, this 
is one of those bathrooms where 
I am willing to overlook its short -
comings. I don’t appreciate that 
the door is o/f_ten le/f_t open, that 
it’s a bit more run-down, or how 
small and intimate it is, but what 
makes Peterson Hall such a great 
bathroom is the consistently low 
temperature they maintain in 
there. It’s nice and chilly, making 
me feel more keen on bundling up 
then stripping down. When I need 
to take care of business, a nice cold 
temperature is something I value. 
It prevents the smell from mari -
nating and preserves a freshness 
that just can’t be beat. 
1. Sixth Dining Hall 
Let me be frank, I’m a sucker 
for anything new and shiny,so 
the Sixth College dining hall was 
obviously something that had me 
impressed. It’s enormous, with 
more stalls than you can count. It’s 
new, clean, quiet, and feels like a 
solid place for chopping logs, but 
what makes this bathroom of note 
is the absolute win for the stall’s 
design choice. While phrasing it 
as a royal squat on the porcelain 
throne makes it feel regal and 
classy, the reality is that taking a poop is a pretty vulnerable posi -
tion. /T_hus we’ve all experienced, 
or can imagine the experience, of 
making eye contact with someone 
through the absurdly large cracks 
that exist in most stalls. But Sixth 
knew better and came in for the 
win, implementing doors with no 
gaps or cracks. As long as it isn’t 
prime rush hour at the dining 
hall, Sixth is the place to poop. 
I promised a list of 10, but I 
felt the need to add a couple hon -
orable mentions in case the bath -
rooms I’ve listed don’t seem like 
your cup of tea. So below you’ll 
/f_ind a couple more spots that 
might come in handy to know 
about. 
1. CTL Building 
Similarly to the Sixth Din -
ing Hall, the Catalyst lecture hall 
by Plant Power has a bathroom 
worth recognizing. It’s new, clean, 
relatively large, and the stalls are 
gapless. Let me also not forget to 
emphasize that this bathroom has 
stall doors that are /f_loor length, 
meaning complete anonymity 
when doing your business. Only 
thing is that the /f_lush is automatic 
and weird, not the most user-
friendly. So I recommend this 
bathroom with the condition of 
proceeding with caution. If you 
don’t want to do a drop and run, 
make sure to familiarize yourself 
with the toilet’s properties before 
setting up camp. 
2. Communications Building 
I’ve only recently begun classes 
in the Communications and Me -
dia Lab building, located near So -
lis Hall. During this past quarter, 
I’ve come to spend a fair amount 
of time there and thus have be -
come well acquainted with their 
bathrooms. /T_hey have bathrooms 
located on both /f_loors and while 
I’ve only had positive experienc -
es, the overall components of the 
bathroom are less than ideal. /T_he 
tiles are all an unsightly yellow, 
there are only two stalls in each 
bathroom, and the type of sinks 
don’t match. /T_here is also a really 
intense light that re/f_lects oﬀ the 
yellow walls, a characteristic that 
has me a bit thrown. Y et despite 
it being a deeply unattractive and 
unsightly locale for a poop des -
tination, something about it has 
earned my deepest aﬀection. 
I hope you enjoyed my list, 
and hope my candidness did not 
leave you too disgusted. Don’t let 
the stigma surrounding potty talk 
deter you from heeding my ad -
vice. Take this campus by storm

POV: Your Sister Forces You to go to a Concert for Some 
Guy Named Harry Styles
By Rosabella Debty
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
When your sister asks if you 
want free pit tickets to Harry 
Styles “Love on Tour” , you /f_irst ask 
if she’s joking.
Y ou then take no more than 
30 minutes to pack your bag and 
head to LA.
My sister and I share the same 
birthday — no, we’re not twins — 
so her present to herself had been 
two nights at “Harry’s House” for 
the /f_irst two opening nights at Kia 
Forum in LA with her friend. Un -
fortunately for her friend, she got 
sick the night before her /f_light. 
Fortunately for me, she didn’t 
ask me to pay her for the tickets. 
I won’t say I’m the biggest Harry 
Styles fan, nor would I ever will -
ingly pay what she and her friend 
did for a general admission ticket, 
no matter how much I love the 
artist. But, I also won’t turn down 
the opportunity to see him if 
asked. 
Because you have to wait in 
line for so long, I made sure to 
bring a book; I was not about to 
waste my phone battery reading 
digitally. I was also half-tempted 
to have a “Y/N” moment, but be -
cause we were so close to the bar -
ricade, there was barely room for 
my arms to not plaster to my chest, 
let alone to hold a whole book. I 
think he locked eyes with me, so 
I’m pretty sure that means we’re getting married, even though I’ve 
never heard of Harry Styles before 
— is he popular?
I’m not sure if I would have 
had as great of an experience if I 
wasn’t with the /f_iend herself. Did 
you guys know that Harry per -
forms the same set for every date 
of his tour in the same area of the 
stage? Imagine my surprise when, 
while in line, she asked me, “Do 
we want to stand in the ‘Matilda’ 
corner or the ‘Satellite’ corner? Or, 
we could do the catwalk slide that 
he runs down. ” And then, a/f_ter analyzing my blank stare, she had 
the gall to be surprised I had no 
clue what she was talking about. 
/T_he only thought in my mind was: 
why would you go to multiple 
nights of the same tour if it is the 
same exact show?
Because she was the expert 
here, I followed her advice and we 
went to the ‘Satellite’ corner. I kid 
you not, I was three heads away 
from the man himself. I was also 
perfectly lined up to a stage light 
with a vengeance. If you look at 
80% of my videos, the light com -
pletely blocks him out when in front of me. And, I’m pretty sure 
in one of them, you can audibly 
hear me sigh because of it.
Like I mentioned earlier, I’m 
not the biggest fan of Harry Styles. 
I feel like my “not like other girls” 
era started because of my sister’s 
love of One Direction, and only 
in private would I admit to lis -
tening to his music until the last 
few years (controversial, I know). 
Luckily, he is one of those artists 
that is so popular that I at least 
knew the chorus to 95% of the 
songs he sang. But, one song I go 
absolutely FERAL for is “Kiwi” — which just so happened to be 
his closing song. My sister knew 
the setlist front and back but had 
failed to mention this key piece of 
information.
I had scratched vocal chords 
for the next three days, and I fully 
put the responsibility on “Kiwi” .
/T_he most disappointing thing 
about Harry Styles, to be honest, 
was his merch. For someone who 
I attribute so much of Gen Z fash -
ion trends to, his merch did not 
produce a single “wow” moment. 
And for the price (come on, $50 
for a dad cap???), it took me until 
the very end to break down and 
buy a sweater, which sported the 
one design that I liked. Capitalism 
won again, unfortunately.
“Love on Tour” is, and will 
probably always be, the most ex -
pensive concert I have ever gone 
to. However, spending our birth -
day weekend together is some -
thing my sister and I never get to 
do, and though we don’t share too 
many interests, my love of going 
to concerts and her love of see -
ing Harry Styles crashed together 
to create an unforgettable night. 
Harry has such a personality on 
stage, and it’s clear that he really 
cares about his fans.
But if you go to see him, plan 
to line up three hours before the 
time you originally decided on, 
and please, stop fueling the feather 
boa industry.

today i am mourning my
sixteen year old self.
i will put her photo up
en mi ofrenda,
and i will decorate her
with pretty blues and greens.
i will set out a plate,
and when she comes i will
tell her she can eat. 
as i pray i will apologize —
she was never seen,
and the goddamn mirror
was always lying. 
i will tell her, we don’t need it
anymore to be pretty.
we have found better re/f_lec -
tions
that can show us our beauty. 
in the eyes and minds
of the ones we love,
and the eyes and mind
of us. 
tonight i am mourning my
sixteen year old self. 
tomorrow i will scream at the 
mirrorand cry about the year that it 
stole,
but for tonight i will sit 
at mi ofrenda, 
and sixteen year old bela
will tell me i look old. 
i will laugh and she will
tell me it’s a joke.
(she knows she’s not funny,
i tell her that hasn’t changed.)
she won’t eat her food,
and so i do. 
she watches enviously,
and i tell her not to — 
she’ll get there one day. 
most days, i mourn
my sixteen year old self.
i hug her in my brain
when i get a good grade. 
i kiss her forehead when 
my lover kisses mine. 
i hold her hand 
when ours intertwine. 
i hold her hair back
when i throw up at parties,
and i tell her not to cry for me.
we are okay now.
we are seen. 
and everybody knows,
everything i do
is for sixteen year old me.

UCSD Women’s Volleyball is Handed “Worst Performance of  the 
Year” by UC Davis
By JAKE LANNON

/T_he UC San Diego Women’s 
Volleyball team (11–14, 4–9 Big 
West) matched up against UC 
Davis (10–13, 5–8 Big West) at 
the LionTree arena, where they 
saw defeat to the Aggies, 3–0. A 
disappointing performance from 
the Tritons in their home arena, 
this marks their fourth time los -
ing 3–0 this season. UC Davis 
took both games this season 
against the Tritons, completing 
the sweep. UC Davis led all sta -
tistical categories in the game, a 
full show of domination against 
UCSD. /T_he Tritons lacked the en -
ergy on Friday night to compete 
with the Aggies, which resulted 
in one of their worst losses of the 
season. 
/T_he /f_irst set started oﬀ well for 
UCSD as they took a one point 
advantage oﬀ the back of a block 
from sophomore middle blocker 
Emily McDaniel and freshman 
outside hitter Katie Rapp, push -
ing the score to 7–8. McDaniel 
would /f_inish the night with a 
team leading six blocks. Unfortu -
nately for the Tritons, the Aggies 
went on a huge run, scoring seven 
straight points and turning the 
lead to six at a 14–8 scoreline. /T_he 
Tritons were down big but surged 
back into the game oﬀ of two 
back-to-back kills from sopho -
more outside hitter Zaria Hen -
derson, tying the game at 22–22. /T_he Tritons completed the come -
back and were primed to take the 
lead and the /f_irst set. Unluckily for 
the Tritons, two back-to-back at -
tack errors lead to their demise, as 
the Aggies closed out the /f_irst set 
25–22.  
UCSD started the second set 
on the back foot with UC Davis 
taking a strong lead early at 11–4 
oﬀ of another huge run. Oﬀ of two 
attacking errors from UC Davis, 
and a kill from sophomore out -
side hitter Ava McInnes, the Tri -
tons were able to pull within three 
points at a score of 15–12. Unfor -
tunately for the Tritons, 3 was the 
closest they would ever get, as UC 
Davis would push the lead to 5 and 
keep it that way for the remainder 
of the set. A /f_inal kill for the UC 
Davis side would mark the end of 
the set at a scoreline of 25–20. /T_he 
Aggies took a commanding lead, 
with the Tritons needing to come 
out faster in the third set. 
Down 2–0,  UCSD faced de -
feat. /T_he team would have to make 
an inspired comeback to win the 
match, and in the third set, it 
looked like they could do just that. 
/T_he Tritons started out strong, 
taking an early 5–6 lead oﬀ of kills 
from McInnes and Rapp. /T_his 
lead was short-lived as the Aggies 
went on a huge run only stopped 
by their own scoring error. /T_he 
score was at a staggering 15–8, 
with more points pouring on for 
the UC Davis side. Another run 
for the Aggies pushed this set out of reach for the Tritons at a score 
of 22–9. Shortly therea/f_ter, the 
Aggies would clean the set up and 
end the Tritons’ misery as a 25–12 
scoreline. /T_his was a  disappoint -
ing /f_inish to this three set match 
for the Tritons.
A/f_ter the game, /T_he UCSD 
Guardian caught up with Coach 
Ricci Luyties, and asked him 
about his team’s performance. “I thought this was maybe our 
worst of the year so far, ” Luyties 
said. “We just didn’t have a lot of 
energy, we weren’t in sync pretty 
much the whole night. We weren’t 
playing very good defense, it was a 
little disappointing. ”
 When asked how the Tritons 
would get ready for the game the 
next night against UC Riverside, 
Luyties responded, “We have to learn from what happened tonight 
and change everything we did and 
come out a completely diﬀerent 
team tomorrow night against Riv -
erside. ” 
/T_he Tritons next face oﬀ  
against UC Irvine on /T_hursday, 
Nov. 10, where they look to re -
deem themselves for a close loss 
they had to the Anteaters earlier 
in the season.
The Wonderful Unpredictability of  the 2022 NFL Season
On /T_hursday, the undefeated 
Philadelphia Eagles took on the 
lowly Houston Texans in a lop -
sided aﬀair to kick oﬀ Week 9 of 
this NFL season. Despite the game 
being tied at 14 at the end of the 
/f_irst half, Philly eventually blew 
the game open and took care of 
business as expected, outscoring 
Houston 15–3 in the second half 
and winning 29–17. Following 
/T_hursday night’s win, the Eagles 
improved their unblemished 8–0 
record and remain the only NFL 
team without a loss this season.
/T_he Eagles’ dominance is just 
one of many plot twists the NFL 
has thrown at viewers. Surprising -
ly, the rest of the NFC East’s teams 
each have a winning percentage By LUKE REYES

boys currently hold a 6–2 record 
with most of their games won with 
backup quarterback Cooper Rush, 
while starter Dak Prescott nurses 
a thumb injury. /T_he New Y ork Gi -
ants also sit at 6–2 and have been 
able to put together wins thanks 
to a rejuvenated Saquon Barkley 
and strong new clubhouse leader 
Brian Daboll. It has been quite 
some time since the NFC East was 
viewed as a powerhouse; at the 
moment, it stands as arguably the 
most competitive division in foot -
ball, but the surprises do not end 
there. 
Coming into this season, most 
NFL fans and analysts predicted 
that the AFC West would be by 
far the most stacked and competi -
tive division in the league, featur -
ing big-shot quarterbacks Patrick 
Mahomes, Russell Wilson, Justin Herbert, and Derek Carr. Many 
felt that any of the four teams 
could win the division considering 
all the star power that had moved 
out west, including Wilson to the 
Broncos, Davante Adams signing 
with the Raiders, and both Khalil 
Mack and J.C. Jackson going to 
the Chargers. Despite all the big 
moves that were made, the play 
in the AFC West has been under -
whelming. /T_he Chiefs comfort -
ably sit in /f_irst place at 5–2, but the 
hobbled Chargers are just a game 
above .500 at 4–3, while both the 
Broncos and Raiders are multiple 
games under .500 and have not 
looked great at all. 
Moreover, other big surprises 
include the Buccaneers and Pack -
ers both having losing records, 
the Vikings only having one loss, 
and the Geno Smith-led Seahawks 
currently sitting in the driver’s seat of the NFC West. Perhaps 
even more surprising,  the LA 
Rams — the defending champi -
ons — are 3–4, the Bengals are 
just a .500 team, and the Jets have 
a winning record. /T_his season has 
been /f_illed with many twists and 
turns and has subverted our ex -
pectations even more than a Rian 
Johnson /f_ilm could do, but despite 
there being a lot of average play 
among most NFL teams this year, 
the amount of parity in the league 
has made way for more intrigue. 
At the moment, it feels like there 
isn’t a clear favorite to win the Su -
per Bowl, and that’s a good thing 
because it leaves fans in suspense 
about the /f_inale of the season. Al -
though the Eagles maintain a per -
fect streak, some have their doubts 
about how far a young quarterback 
like Jalen Hurts can lead his team 
in the postseason. Some may ar -gue that the safest bet would be to 
pick either the Chiefs or the Bills 
as favorites based on their quar -
terbacks, but if there is anything 
last postseason taught us, it’s that 
any given Sunday, a young gamer 
like Joe Burrow can beat anybody. 
As we approach the second 
half of the regular season, it’s safe 
to say that we are in store for an 
exciting /f_inish if the pattern con -
tinues. It still feels like most teams 
can very well make the playoﬀs 
and possibly make some noise, 
and hopefully, the league main -
tains this level of unpredictability. 
As it stands, over half the teams 
in the NFL have a shot at doing 
something special, and that’s what 
is making this season a ton of fun. 
If you are a football fan, buckle 
up for an exciting rest of the sea -
son, because your team might just 
have a special run.
