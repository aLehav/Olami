Two state senators have joined 
forces last Wednesday to introduce an 
amendment that would remove the 130-year-old statute that grants the University of California immunity from legislative control.
Senators Leland Y ee (D–San Francisco/San Mateo) and Roy Ashburn (R– Bakersfield) drafted the proposal in response to a number of “egregious offenses” committed by the UC Board of Regents, according to Y ee spokesman Adam Keigwin. 
Among these offenses were alleg-
edly unjust restrictions in the UC nonaffiliate speech policy, as well as the regents’ alleged lack of public accountability. 
Most notably, Keigwin cited 
“exorbitant pay hikes to top execu-tives” amid an economic crisis and rising student fees as motivation for the proposal. 
If passed, Y ee and Ashburn’s 
amendment would strip the regents of their autonomy, giving the state the ability to pass laws on issues such as salary increases and speech rights. However, Keigwin said, “nothing theoretically changes with day-to-day operations. ” 
Keigwin pointed to the California 
State University system as an exam-ple, which is subject to state laws but also has a board of trustees to hand down operational decisions.

The committee formed in Fall 
Quarter 2007 to revise and combine the UCSD speech and distribution-of-literature policies held its final meeting last Wednesday. After arguing through a few details, its members declared the draft finished and ready for public release.
The new 
policy draft is at least three times the size of the two existing pol-icies combined. Changes include an 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. time slot in which the use of amplified electronic sound is restricted  to 
an updated list of zones across campus, stream-lined from the draft’s list of arbitrary slots two weeks ago but still cutting one half hour from the existing policy. The draft also establishes a volume limit of 90 decibels for any amplified sound; permission to use chalk as a form of expression on uni-versity property, which is currently not allowed; and a preamble largely pre-served from a speech-policy proposal created by students last fall.
“This speech policy is designed to 
be broad, flexible and to acknowledge the historic significance of free speech, while also preserving the research, teaching and public service mission of the university, ” the preamble’s closing line reads.
At an emergency meeting three 
weeks ago, students and administrators on the committee agreed it was impor-tant to release the draft immediately for public comment. Student repre-sentatives said they thought it essential to open the public-input period while campus hype surrounding the com-mittee was still active, fearing it might

The A.S. Council’s summer plans 
include re-examining its services via 
a student survey and researching both a possible broadcast tower for KSDT radio and an on-campus media center to serve student publications.
Vice President of Finances and 
Resources Peter Benesch said it’s unlikely the council will alter its cur-rent budget for any particular service, but will use the student responses to assess the scale and necessity of any eventual changes. 
 “It’s good to evaluate and see what 
we’re doing and if we could do it bet-ter, ” Benesch said.Apart from the survey, the council 
will consider investing in a broad-casting tower for KSDT, which cur-r e n t l y  c a n  o n l y  b e  s t r e a m e d  f r o m  t h e Internet. Benesch said increased fund-ing could help KSDT apply for and construct a radio tower, though no definite plans will be laid out until he speaks with next year’s station manag-ers.
KSDT Music Director Marcus 
Rosario said he first considered applying for a tower after register-ing KSDT with the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System in 2007. He said KSDT needs approval from the UC Board of Regents before establish-ing a broadcasting frequency, along with acceptance from the Federal Communications Commission and approximately $15,000 to construct the tower itself, requiring an over-18-month process. 
KSDT has received over $8,600 
from the A.S. Council as a result of the A.S. fee referendum this year, in addition to its annual budget of $2,500, according to General Manager Ivan Dominguez. 
Rosario said KSDT will appoint a 
student to spearhead the application process next year. “There’s so much more to radio 
than just music, ” Rosario said. “There are things like reaching out to commu-nication majors and the whole com-

iRide.ucsd.edu
Transportation ServicesUC spokesman Pete King said 
handing over such tight control to leg-
islators would endanger the univer-sity’s academic freedom, and pointed out that the government already has a say in the regents’ actions.
“We go to them for our gen-
eral fund money, the governor appoints a majority of the board and Californians get a say in that if we’re not doing a good job they won’t come to our schools, ” he said. 
According to King, government 
interference in day-to-day affairs could not only cause financially and administratively harmful delays, but might also jeopardize the university’s freedom to teach more controversial subjects.
The UC system, King said, is a 
large organization that is current-ly maintaining a balanced budget, whereas the Legislature has “a job to do up there that’s big enough for them already. ” 
The university’s current adminis-
trative immunity was enacted upon it’s foundation, when there was strong public support for the UC system to become a series of agricultural schools. 
The educational and legislative 
leaders at the time created an inde-pendent board of regents that could, without worrying about answering to voters, design campuses with a broader focus. 
Keigwin acknowledged that 
“maybe [immunity] was the right decision for the time, ” but said the institution should now be made accountable to the public.
At the regents’ meeting last May,  
board members proposed increasing chancellor salaries at UC Davis and UC San Francisco to above $400,000 each. The university argued that even after the increases, those salaries were still below the market rate. 
According to Keigwin, this pay 
hike was one of the primary reasons behind the new amendment. 
“[The regents] continuously take 
care of those at the top of the food chain and hurt those at the bottom, ” Keigwin said. “Enough is enough. ”
The amendment would make 
state laws applicable to the university, though it does not explicitly contain any policy suggestions or changes. 
One piece of legislation that could 
apply to the UC system should the amendment pass is Senate Bill 217, also drafted by Y ee, which would pro-hibit executive pay increases in years of financial crisis. 
Both the Senate and Assembly 
would have to pass the proposal with a two-thirds majority before it  could go before the voters. 
Readers can contact Hayley-Bisceglia 
Martin at  hbiscegl@ucsd.edu.munication department and student organizations. ”
The council will also examine the 
possibility of creating a media room in Student Center or Price Center. The media center would provide work-space and technological resources to print organizations like the Koala  and 
California Review , and broadcast net-
works such as KSDT and Student-Run Television. 
SRTV General 
Manager Ali Hadian said a media center would be a great help because poor conditions in the organization’s cur-rent Student Center space — including a poor ventilation sys-tem — make filming difficult. 
The survey will 
assess student inter-est in A.S. services — programs that the council finds ben-eficial to the student body  — includ-ing A.S. Safe Ride, the holiday airport shuttle and the A.S. Graphic Studio. 
Benesch said Safe Ride is likley to 
see the most changes, as councilmem-bers claim the service became too slow after it switched providers from Cloud 9 Shuttles to Express Shuttles in fall 
2008. 
“We renegotiated contracts last 
year to try to save some money, and that was great because we do want to make things more efficient, ” Benesch said. “But unfortunately, it seemed like there was a big difference in the service [Express Shuttles] provided. We want to look back and see if [these concerns are] the general sentiment and, if [they are], try to see what we can do. ”
He said it is unlikely the service 
will immediately change its provider or alter its hours of operation — cur-rently Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Additionally, its annual budget of $27,000 will remain the same.
Benesch said the 
council will evalu-ate student opinion about the holiday airport shuttle to see 
if there is demand for later hours. The survey will address more general stu-dent opinions about the A.S. Graphic Studio, because it is a relatively new service.

Subramaniam said many stu-
dents in the pre-med track only 
want to go to medical school instead of pursuing work in engineering. The department will replace the pre-med track with a new major that will focus on engineering and design while still preparing students for medical school. 
“The [pre-med] program was a 
little diluted because the students felt that they were not getting very strong engineering foundations, ” Subramaniam said. “So we decided in order to give them what they want, we need to morph it into something where the students would be both confident with what they are learning and prepared with a more quantita-tive background. ” 
Subramaniam said the replace-
ment track will most likely be called “biosystems: biomedical devices, ” and that it could become available by 2011.
Both the biotechnology and bio-
engineering tracks offer admission to only 35 students per year. Currently, students must apply to the tracks as freshmen, and are not allowed to transfer in later.  
According to A.S. Engineering 
Senator Shikha Kothari, the 10 appli-cants with the highest GPAs will be admitted into the programs. 
Kothari said the biotechnology 
and bioengineering tracks are the most competitive and desirable in the department because they are certi-fied by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology. 
Because many employers and 
graduate schools require ABET accreditation, graduating with a major not certified by ABET can significantly limit competitiveness in the bioengineering industry, according to the department’s Web site.
Freshmen and sophomores who 
are currently enrolled in the pre-med track and have completed their pre-
requisite courses will be allowed to apply for admission into the new bio-engineering and biotechnology open-ings. The 2009-10 freshman class will be the last class to complete the pre-med program.

die out over the summer. 
At the same time, committee mem-
bers said it was important to avoid 
— if only by a few weeks — a repeat of the 2007 speech-policy proposal’s chaotic finals-week release. Those revi-sions were immediately attacked by the American Civil Liberties Union, the 
Academic Senate and student activists 
for being draconian.
But by the end of the May 6 meet-
ing, UCSD Police Department Lt. Dave Rose and Campus Counsel Dan Park were still concerned over lan-guage that would require all enforce-ment to be enacted “in a manner that minimizes the impact on expressive activity” — already changed two weeks 
prior from the students’ original “in 
the least restrictive manner possible” — because it would be difficult for police to interpret.
Rose and Park told fellow commit-tee members that from a legal perspec-tive, “minimal” impact could techni-cally be defined as no impact at all, and overall impact on free expression is difficult to predict. 
A.S.-appointed student represen-
tative Erin Brodwin said that “mini-mum” does not necessarily mean zero, at which point Committee Chair Sally Brainerd pulled up the Cambridge Online Dictionary definition of “mini-
mum” and “minimal” on the overhead 
projector. 
Finally, though graduate student 
representative Benjamin Balthaser looked somewhat defeated (he had originally resisted any change from “in the least restrictive manner possible”), the committee agreed to instead use “in a manner that minimizes the limi-tation on expressive activity, ” which 
Rose said would be a very straightfor-
ward requirement for police to follow.
Brainerd proposed that — though the public-comment period will not officially begin until the first week of Fall Quarter 2009 — Balthaser should present the finished draft to the Graduate Student Association, and Brodwin and fellow undergraduate representative James Baldwin should 
present it to the A.S. Council for pre-
liminary review. The public comment period will extend until the end of the upcoming Fall Quarter, and the com-mittee will consider all input during Winter Quarter 2010, Brainerd said. 
Once those final changes have been 
made, Vice Chancellors Penny Rue and Steven W . Relyea will approve and release the policy. 
The meeting closed with one 
final add-on to the “chalking” clause: “Environmentally sound  clean-up is 
enco urage d
. ”

It has been two years since the uni-
versity was forced by a coalition of students, civil-rights groups, 
staff and faculty to retract its con-stitutionally troubled speech policy. Condemned by groups and institu-tions ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union and labor unions to the Academic Senate, it was a draco-nian policy that forbade all protest without prior approval from admin-istrators, banned political speech by university employees while on campus and assigned university minders to student demonstrations. 
Since that time, the university 
reconvened the PPM 510 speech and advocacy committee, with the addition of three student representatives from the Graduate Student Association and the A.S. Council. The students were assured that the administration had no idea who was responsible for the previ-ous policy, and besides, those nobodies who never existed surely wouldn’t do it again. 
The students brought forth their 
own counterproposal. The proposal was sweeping, but also quite simple: It demanded an open campus in which speech rights would be enjoyed by students, staff, faculty and community members, provided they did not create a sustained disruption. Unlike the pre-vious policy draft, the students did not see free speech — and even the occa-sional disruptive speech act — to be at odds with the primary educational and social role of a university. 
As was suggested by a memo from 
the Academic Senate, protests for civil rights and against the Vietnam War during a previous generation were seen at the time as disruptive but ultimately created a more open, vibrant univer-sity. According to Thomas Jefferson, a little disruption every now and then can be healthy for a democracy. 
After over a year of criticizing the 
student draft, the administration final-ly offered its counterproposal. Despite the fanfare, what the administration proposed is ultimately a dressed-up version of what has been practiced at UCSD for decades: Price Center, Library Walk, the Geisel Library tree and the Student Center grassy hill are generally available for student demon-stration with amplified sound, while the rest of the university has limited access.
Highlights from the new affiliates 
policy include:
The campus is open for gathering 
and demonstration without amplified sound for university affiliates, as well as individuals and groups sponsored by affiliates.
With handheld amplified sound 
(e.g. bullhorn), affiliates — as well as groups and individuals sponsored by affiliates — may engage in speech activity without reservation at the part of Library Walk adjacent to Price Center, the Geisel tree, the Student Center hill and Price Center Plaza.
Selected areas on campus from 
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., give or take, are available for speech activity with handheld amplified sound including Revelle Plaza, Warren Quad, Sun God Lawn, Muir Quad, Solís Quad, ERC Green and the Sixth College Residency Court.
Reservations for events and speech 
activity with amplified sound will con-tinue unchanged.
Posting remains limited to bulletin 
boards, kiosks and selected areas in Price Center.
The university will minimize limi-
tations on free speech when enforc-ing the policy. Examples include being asked to turn down the volume rath-er than being shut down, or being asked to allow traffic through a cor-ridor rather than being asked to vacate. Administrators must also warn and negotiate with demonstrators before taking enforcement action unless there is a clear and present danger of physi-cal harm.
Student representatives were suc-
cessful in ensuring that the adminis-tration will enforce the policy with a light touch. We were also successful in ensuring that restrictions to speech outside the student centers and Library Walk be limited to sound volume. In other words, under the new 
policy, students and employees will be able to assemble, gather and speak any-where on campus. While the proposed policy doesn’t open up the campus as students imagined, it also doesn’t enforce free-speech zones.
As one of the students who advo-
cated an open university, I am disap-pointed by the new policy. Nonetheless, I reluctantly endorse it. The univer-sity should recognize that students and employees won an important victory — they defeated an unjust and harsh policy and made important improve-ments over the current policy. 
Perhaps most importantly, they 
won the explicit right to student noti-fication and representation should any changes be proposed to the new policy. We did not get everything we wanted, and indeed, the student draft was largely defeated in the commit-tee. But we were able to defend and even expand upon the basic right of students and employees to organize, speak and protest without undue inter-ference by university authorities.
I also say this because students 
have a much larger free-speech fight looming. While the students were hard at work trying to fight for a new policy at UCSD, the UC Board of Regents passed a nonaffiliates policy last year — perhaps the biggest change in speech policy to affect a public uni-

STATE NEWS  — When the UC 
Board of Regents held a teleconference for its annual fee-raising powwow in May, students stormed the call for a courtesy 20-minute question-and-answer session. They shared stories of financial difficulties, begging the regents to keep fees low.
But once board members had 
grown impatient with the pity input session, they hastily wrapped up the conversation and voted to hike stu-dent fees. Though they’ d never publicly admit it, they made one thing crystal clear that day: Students have no influ-ence over administrative decisions at the University of California.
But a new bill — introduced last 
Wednesday by state Senators Leland Y ee (D-San Francisco/San Mateo) and Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield) — could potentially shift a lot more power to students.
The legislation proposes to remove 
the 130-year-old statute that grants the UC system immunity from legislative control by 2011, meaning the state could pass laws regulating university policies and pay practices. Sure, this wouldn’t necessarily mean you and your lab partner would be deciding Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s sal-ary, but it would certainly establish more public accountability between California voters, the officials they elect and the state’s flagship higher-education system.
After recently hiring two new 
chancellors for the UC San Francisco and UC Davis campuses with annual salaries over $400,000, it’s question-able whether UC President Mark G. Yudof and the crew can keep them-selves from offering their higher-up pals exorbitant benefits. More state control could do the UC system right by ensuring more frugal hiring deci-sions in times of crisis, or — at the very least — preventing already overin-flated salaries from being hiked during a recession.
State legislators may have an equal-
ly bad (if not worse) history of irre-sponsible budgeting, but at least they are under strict laws to ensure that public officials’ compensation is fair and transparent.
Currently, Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox earns $382,416 a year — quite the pretty penny when compared to the $212,179 annual salary Arnold Schwarzenegger chooses not to accept for his gubernatorial duties. Though overseeing UCSD is probably a cool breeze compared to running the entire state of California, that hasn’t stopped the UC Board of Regents from boost-ing the pay and bonuses of many administrators well above those of our elected state officials. 
Although Yudof and other oppo-
nents of the bill think regulating the university is too extreme a step — they say academics and politics shouldn’t mix — they’re exaggerating the legisla-tion’s potential effects. The law would authorize enforcing the state’s speech policies and pay practices at the uni-versity, but would have no real influ-ence on academic decisions. 
The California State University 
system, which isn’t immune to state law like the University of California, doesn’t deal with state legislators who want to regulate specifics in their cur-riculum. Rather, CSUs have benefited from legislation (proposed by Leland, uncoincidentally) that bans trustees from raising executive salaries during years when state funding has been cut.

passes, it should be a wake-up call to the regents: Students are fed up with their executive power trips. Even though the regents’ 20-minute input session was a sweet attempt at pre-tending they care, students need more solid reassurance that those up top are spending precious (and rising) tuition revenue wisely.

mnchin@ucsd.edu.We’ve reached the year’s end! Now just one more exam-crammed two-week 
sprint until we’re done! If you’re lucky, this means beach basking and Slurpee sipping the summer away. But if you’re like me, it means gradu-ation and saying a sad goodbye to a UCSD institution: “Lights and 
Sirens. ” And so it’s with a heavy heart 
that I present to you the final install-ment of “Stealing the Shoes” in the f o r m  o f  m y  a n n u a l  B e s t  o f  “ L i g h t s  and Sirens. ”
Let’s get the ball rolling with the 
Outstanding Senior Award . This 
year’s prize is shared by three cos-tumed characters: The troubadour who put on his own show outside the La Jolla Playhouse on April 30, wear-ing a Burger King crown and yelling; the fashionista dressed in all red leath-er at Geisel Library on Oct. 13; and the man hanging around the Institute for Telecommunications building in a “sailor-like” hat on Feb. 3. 
Next, the debut of a much-
deserved accolade: MacGyvers of the Ye ar . Congrats to the three young 
men who broke into Argo Hall over winter break armed with just a few tools and “a little white dog. ” Their ingenuity and prioritizing finesse is matched only by the stupidity of these next winners. This year’s Uh, 
You’re Dumb Award  goes to the per-
son who sent a series of threatening e-mails to the literature department, then retracted them after realizing he’ d contacted the wrong department. The girl who called police after get-ting wasted and missing her flight home was a close runner-up. And honorable mentions go to the student who, somehow, accidentally got super glue in his eye during lab (it was “not burning”) and the guy who dislocated his shoulder “trying to get out of bed. ”
Similarly, the Only at UCSD 
Award  goes to the citizen who 
reported a chemical spill on April 6, emphasizing that the radioactive material had been “decayed over four half-lives”!
On a more somber note, I pres-
ent the Most Convincing Evidence 
that Racism is Alive and Well in California Award  to the callers who 
reported the black male carrying a “large box with candy” on Sept. 30, the black male “leaning on the wall” at Ridgewalk on Oct. 6, the black male walking toward the Chancellor’s House on Nov. 19, the black female at the La Jolla del Sol apartments on Feb. 25, the Latino male at Villa La Jolla Drive on May 11 and the Latino male “wearing shorts” at the Stein Clinical Research building on Oct. 2.
To all the residents who called 
police on their neighbors — for a “loud fan” on April 19, the “laugh-ing” at Goldberg Hall on Sept. 30, the “singing” at Beagle Hall on April 8, the “talking” in a Thurgood Marshall College dorm room on Oct. 19, the “jazz music” at Africa Hall on Feb. 17 and the “violin playing” at Kathmandu Hall on April 22 — espe-cially the person who complained that the “Sun God Festival was too loud, ” you have buzzkillingly embraced 7]\?Q\PI*IVO

The policy bans all free-speech 
activity on campus by the public — 
including alumni, parents and former staff — unless granted explicit permis-sion by the university or invited by an affiliated member of campus. 
Rather than imagine a university 
that is a vibrant and necessary cen-ter for democratic and civic engage-ment, the regents imagine a sealed-off office park in which students and researchers will not have to be troubled by a public — a public that is increasingly phased out of a uni-versity dedicated more and more to corporate research. 
With this privatized public, the 
university creates a troubling prece-dent in which only those who pay have access to public institutions. This not only deprives the public of a valuable resource, it deprives students of the crucial capacity to hear, engage with and debate voices from the community around them. 
Nearly all social movements involv-
ing students that were worth their salt — from labor to civil rights to global solidarity — depended on these non-affiliates to reach out to the broader world. And as access is increasingly denied to low-income students due to fee hikes and proposed cuts to the Cal Grant program, those who can pay become a smaller and smaller number of people. 
While we have won a local victory 
in defeating the draconian policy of two years ago, I’m afraid we may be losing a larger fight for free speech in the entire UC system.

Dear Editor,
As one of many UCSD alumni who 
go on to attend UC Hastings College of the Law, I was shocked and dismayed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s radi-cal proposal to eliminate all state fund-ing for California’s oldest law school.
Hastings is a first-tier law school 
that has been educating our nation’s top leaders for 131 years. Notable alumni include two California Supreme Court justices; numerous state and federal judges and politicians; and civil-rights leaders such as the assassinated San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Clara Shortridge Foltz, the first practic-ing female lawyer in the United States. 
Hastings also publishes several 
acclaimed scholarly journals — includ-ing the oldest constitutional law jour-nal in the country — and our Moot Court program is currently ranked second in the nation.
Schwarzenegger’s proposal would 
single out Hastings for a 100 percent cut in funding, compared to an esti-mated 18 percent to 22 percent funding reduction to the UC and California State University systems. This decision would eliminate 25 percent of Hastings’ academic budget and could lead to yearly tuition increases of $8,000 per student. Such disproportionate treat-ment is unjust and alarming. If the pub-lic lets Schwarzenegger decide which educational institutions are worthy of state funding, there’s no telling which schools could be on the chopping block. 
Cutting $10.3 million from 
Hastings will barely make a dent in the $24 billion deficit. What it could do, however, is jeopardize the livelihoods of current students and shake public faith in the stability of the otherwise stellar UC system.
I urge members of the UC commu-
nity to unite against these drastic mea-sures by contacting their state and local representatives. With a strong and unit-ed voice, we can show Schwarzenegger that California cannot attain stability by weakening the institutions that produce its political and social leaders.

UCSD’s acidic no-fun atmosphere. 
For this, you have earned the 2008-09 Thanks for Making This Place What It Is Award .
Changing gears, I’ d like to con-
gratulate the following couples for boldly earning a Get It Girl Award : 
The pair seen “engaging in lewd activity” in front of Burger King just after 2 a.m. on Jan. 15, and the couple reported as “having sex real loud” at Geneva Hall on May 6.
Next, the Use What Y ou Got to 
Get What You Want Award  goes 
to the 10 intoxicated ladies who, in expert fashion, strutted along Gilman Drive wearing only black underwear on Nov. 6. Honorable mentions go to the guy who found a lost cell phone on Oct. 26 and promised to return it only in Tijuana and only in exchange for $20 and a Powerade, and the per-son who bought lunch at Thornton Hospital with a forged $10 bill. 
And finally, here’s this colum-
nist’s last nod to college debauchery. I’m pleased to announce a four-way Shining Light in “Lights and Sirens” Award  tie. Congrats to the group 
who snuck into Canyonview pool for some after-hours swimming on Oct. 4, the students who hauled a keg into Pacific Hall on Sun God, the guys seen climbing the bear statue on Sept. 29 and the pirate fellow hang-ing out near University Centers 201 on Jan. 26 with a “full bottle of rum. ” Thanks for lending this place a little personality. 6WVINNQTQI\M;XMMKP8WTQKa

      UNCOMMON FOLKUCSD and the Kumeyaay tribe continue a legal battle over 10,000-year-old 
American-Indian skeletons unearthed from beneath the chancellor’s house.
Mansions built atop ancient 
American-Indian burial grounds are the stuff of legends. But just off campus on Regents Road, that 
stereotype is more fact than fiction.
Sitting literally on top of an ancient 
American-Indian cemetery — UCSD’s records show 29 human remains have been removed from the chancellor’s historic residence over the past 80 years — the University House was declared unlivable in 2004 due to hazards and structural problems. 
The approximately 10,000-year-old bones 
of the two adults were dug up from the prop-erty in 1976 by Cal State Northridge archeol-ogy students. The two skeletons are frozen in a unique arrangement, with a young man buried at the feet of an older woman. They are among the oldest skeletal remains yet discovered in the Western Hemisphere, and form the only “double burial” of their kind in the Americas. 
The Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriations 
Committee (KCRC), a group of federally rec-ognized San Diego tribes, submitted a request to the university in 2006 asking for the remains to be repatriated   — or returned — to the Kumeyaay Indians.
The KCRC asserted that their ancestors have 
been here since “time immemorable, ” and said they intend to rebury the remains if they are returned. 
The Native American Grave Protection and 
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), federal legislation passed in 1990, details the official guidelines by which human remains can be identified and returned to American-Indian tribes that request them.
The NAGPRA states that remains must be 
expeditiously returned when a tribe can prove cultural affiliation. This occurs when a “prepon-derance of the evidence — based on geographi-cal, kinship, biological, archeological, linguistic, folklore, oral tradition, historical evidence, or other information or expert opinion — reason-ably leads to such a conclusion. ”
In 2008, a UCSD panel assigned with the 
task of determining cultural affiliation con-cluded that the bones were “culturally uniden-tifiable. ” The panel submitted a report that said, “Our finding is that there is not a significant preponderance of evidence to support an affir-mation of cultural identification or affiliation with any modern group. ” 
The KCRC found this highly offensive. “We know that they are culturally identifi-
able, ” KCRC spokesman Steve Banegas said. “ All we want is to merely rebury them, and respect them, and treat them as the human beings that they once were. ”
Banegas criticized the way the university has 
continued to handle the situation.
“This institution is supposed to be teaching 
people about values and learning and under-standing, and wanting to stretch their hand out to the Kumeyaay nation, ” he said. “But they refuse to sit and talk with us as equals, and we’re not going to get anywhere until that happens. ”
Ross Frank, a UCSD professor and chair of the ethnic studies department, presented the single dissenting view in the panel. He said the methodology used by the committee was flawed because it looked at each piece of evidence pre-sented by the Kumeyaay in an isolated manner. 
According to Frank, evaluating pieces of evi-
dence independently from each other is contra-dictory to the language and spirit of NAGPRA. He said that evaluating all the pieces of evidence as a whole would “weave a kind of tapestry” that supports cultural affiliation. 
“If you did that, and did that in an interdisci-
plinary manner, using both scientific and social scientific methods, you could reasonably come to a conclusion that there is, in fact, a cultural affiliation, ” he said.
Frank also pointed out that the review com-
mittee did not have any native representation, and his minority report strongly supported cultural affiliation. 
Margaret Schoeninger, anthropology profes-
sor and head of the review committee, defended her designation of the bones as unidentifiable. 
“We had taken the whole thing together, ” 
Schoeninger said. “What bothers me extremely deeply is the dismissal of an evidence-based belief system and the privileging of a belief-based system. I don’t doubt that the people are genuine, nor do I have a lack of respect. But they’re beliefs, they’re feelings … NAGPRA is not based on deeply held feelings. ” 
A UC-wide committee later confirmed the 
original committee’s majority ruling of the bones as culturally unidentifiable, dashing most hopes the KCRC had of repatriation. 
That is, until a request from Vice Chancellor 
of Resource Management and Planning Gary Matthews was submitted to UC Office of the

THE PRICE 
CENTER 
BIRDThe cloud s darken. Avian war cries 
resound, and the orchestra leaps 
into a baleful tremolo as unsuspect-
ing academics star  — one by one — in the storied horror plot of the Price Center stairway. 
It’s a live Alfred Hitchcock flick in full 
color, and the audience is growing.
The saga began May 18, when 
University Centers officials received word that a small, black bird was aggressively swooping down on pedestrians as they descended from Library Walk to Price Center Plaza. Upon investigation, main-tenance staff discovered two Brewer’s blackbirds guarding a nest of four eggs — which hatched Friday — in a tree above the stairs.
According to associate professor of 
ecology, behavior and evolution David Holway, the bird’s behavior is not ran-dom. During periods of fledging, Brewer’s blackbirds — like many other avian spe-cies — are extremely protective of their young.
Disinclined to disturb the nest, 
University Centers Director Paul Terzino 
and his staff decided to post signs at each 
end of the path warning passersby of the territorial residents.
“We’re just trying to protect the things, 
but protect our students at the same time, ” he said. “It’s comical, but in a macabre kind of way. ”
Reports of physical damage have been 
more or less limited to light tickling and disheveled hair; more notable is the fan 
base that has accumulated with the rise in 
attacks. Spectators now frequent the stairs to encourage the bird, and online chatter has exploded.Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Sylvie Lee, a two-time victim, has posted hours of video footage on the humorous “self-help” Facebook group she created for victims. 
If anything, she said, the phenomenon 
has unified the campus community.
“Honestly, it’s hilarious, ” she said. “It’s 
the best thing to happen to campus in a while. ”
Her Facebook group, “Victims of the 
Price Center Bird, ” has attracted over 1,300 members in just two weeks. Its long list of comments includes violent threats and elaborate apocalyptic theories. 
One blogger, Revelle College freshman 
Sameer Bahl, cited the Book of Genesis, suggesting that animals on college cam-puses have overstepped their inferior “place in society. ”
“I think animals on college campuses 
feel they have a sense of entitlement, ” he said. “I’ve seen them poop on people shamelessly. ”
Nevertheless, Lee and Bahl empha-
sized that their commentary is facetious, and they urged victims to refrain from 
harming the birds.
University Centers Associate Director 
John Payne said potential deterrents 
would include amplified predator noises and large Mylar balloons with eyes, but that these options are both unsightly and expensive.
“We’ll prune the trees more frequently 
so we can see the nests, but there are times when nature and man just have to try to 
get along the best they can, ” he said.

In an effort to inform students about the ongoing

held ofﬁ  ce hours in a tent on Library Walk on Thursday, May 28. Though it was more subdued than previous department teach-ins on the matter conducted by professors and graduate students, organizers hoped the event would keep the rest of the campus mindful of the situation. John D.

UCSD political science professor Alan Houston 
spent hours sitting in the British Library — United Kingdom’s national public library 
— scouring a seemingly endless pile of manuscripts, before finally reaching his last catalog. Despite its dreary title, upon reading handwritten manuscript “Copies of Letters Relating to the March of General Braddock, ” Houston said he nearly jumped out of his seat. 
He had just discovered copies of 47 letters both 
written by and addressed to Benjamin Franklin. Dating all the way back to 1755, the letters had not been brought to light in over 250 years, an unexpected treasure to inform his forthcoming book on Franklin’s political involvement.
The letters recount the story behind Franklin’s 
military campaign to provide wagons and horses to British Gen. Edward Braddock during the French and Indian War. They were archived by Thomas Birch, one of Franklin’s acquaintances at the Royal Society, which had just recognized Franklin for his scientific accomplishments in the field of electricity.
“Birch was an antiquarian — someone who col-
lects historical documents, ” Houston said. “So Birch met [Franklin] because he was a scientist, but copied the letters because he saw them as important historical articles of the past about a military campaign that was notorious and deals with one of the greatest scientists from North America. ”
Houston believes the letters had not been discov-

of the British  Library.
“People  had been  less thorou gh 
in g oing throu gh British  archives  
than  going in Am erican archives,”  
Houston  said. “In the catalo g, it just 
said ‘Copies of Letters  Relatin g to 
the March of General B raddo ck, ’ and 
who wou
ld have  thou ght that it had 
anythin g to do with Franklin? H ow 
I foun d them was  just the accident 
of bein g a very  diligent resear cher, 
tracking do wn every  possible  sour ce 
and looking at anythin g I coul d 
imagine.”
Alth
ough the letters  do not pro-
vide any new infor mation  regarding 
Braddock’s military  campaign and 
eventual  defeat , they  provi de more 
groun d-level  details  of the confli ct 
between the militia  and Pennsylvania  
farmers.
“The traditional  way of understa nd-ing the story  was Benjamin Franklin 
went out and asked [the  farmers] to 
borro w their horses  and wa gons, and 
they said, ‘O f course , we’re glad to 
help,’”  Houston  said. “But when you 
read the letters , it becomes clear th at 
it’s a bit more complicated. [The  farm-
ers] alrea dy had bad experien ces with 
the army coming throu gh and sol-
diers stealin g their horses.  They were 
alrea dy anxious and upset , unwilling 
to trust  Franklin and army.”
The l
etters  also provi de more 
insig ht into F ranklin’s relationship  with 
his wife. T hough Franklin has been  
dubbe d a womanizer in m odern biog-
raphies, the letters  give him another  
chance.
“He ends [the letters ] by tellin g how 
much he miss
es [his wife], ” H ouston  
said. “He tells her to write and how 
much he likes receivin g letters  from 
her. I’ d li ke to think of it meanin g that 
he felt some real affection for her.”Houston ’s discovery  was printe d 
for the first time in the April issue  
of the Willia m and Ma ry Qua rterly, 
a histori cal journal.  The professor  is 
currently in talks with the History  
Channel  toward developin g a segment 
on the letters.
“The real interest  for the broa d pub-
li
c is that it’s on Benjamin Franklin, and 
he’s such a central  figure to American 
identity ,”  Houston  said. “The metaphor  
that I use  is for someone  looking for 
sunken ships. T his is not like finding a 
whole ship; we alrea dy know to
o much 
[about  Franklin] for that.  It’s like find-
ing a treasure  chest that’s filled w ith 
really  cool stuff: coins  and artifac ts. 
And the thrill  is that you didn’t even  
expect to find anythin g. Histor y is still 
being made, and we’re still finding new 
things.”
Readers can contac t Jas mine Ta a t 
jata@ucs d.edu.President late last May, asking for 
a recommendation  to the federal 
Depart ment
 of the Interior to repa-
triate  the bones.
“I believe that the wisest , most 
appropriate  and m ost respe ctful 
action to take at this point w ould 
be to repatriate ,”  Matthe ws staid in 
the letter. “ Doin g so would achieve 
an outcome that is consistent  with 
NAGP R
A. Moreover , it would bal-
ance the scientific benefit  that has 
alrea dy been  achieve d with the value  
of recognizin g the sincere and pro-
foun dly held cultural  views that have  
been  expresse d by the representa-
tives  of the Kumeyaay N ation in San 
Dieg o.”
Matt
hews also pointe d out that 
repatriation  could assist  the uni-
versity ’s push  to increase  diversity.  
Currently , less than  1 per cent of the 
UCSD student body is Am erican-
Indian , none  of whom are Kumeyaay.
Though approval  of Matthe ws’ 
request would retur
n the bones  to 
KCRC, it would not overturn  the 
committee ’s rulin g that the remains 
are culturally  unidentifiable.  For this 
reason , leaders of the KCRC do not 
officially  back the letter. 
A state ment issue d by the KCRC 
in early  May st
ated that the Kumeyaay  
have  provi ded the university w ith a 
mountain  of evidence from linguistic, 
anthropolo gical, archaeolog ical and histori cal scholars  to support  their 
claim.
The state ment said that acceptin g 
the remains as culturall y unidentifi-
able “sets a dangerous precedent for 
future  claims, both  from KCRC and 
other  tribes w hose  ancestors  may be 
in the possession  of the UC.”
Banegas said he feels  the univer-
sity shoul d admit  the remains right-
fully  belon g to the Kume yaay , and 
is offen ded to be asked for proof  of 
somethin g he feels  is obvious.
“They give the impression that 
they  want to give [the remains] back, 
but yet they  have  all these  condi-
tions ,”  Banegas said. “They’ve given  
the impr
ession that all we have  to do 
is take them back and everythin g will 
go away, and that’s not true. F or some 
odd reason , they  don’t seem to think 
that they ’re our ancestors  … What  
they ’re basin g this on, I don ’t know, 
othe
r than  a few people  not wantin g 
to repatriate  for whatever  reason. ”
According to Science m agazine , 
Schoenin ger and m embers  of the 
American Association  of Physic al 
Anthropolog ists sent a letter to the 
Depart ment of the Interior c laiming 
th
e bones  are too important  to be 
reburie d. 
In April, at the annual  meetin g 
of the AAPA, S choenin ger m ade a 
presentation  on the bones ’ scientific 
importan ce.
However, Frank said the belief  that scientists w ill be able to study the 
bones  if they  are not returne d to the 
KCRC is merely  a presu mption. 
“If they  find that they ’re culturally  
unaffiliate d, that doesn ’t say anythin g 
about  what happens  to the bones ,”  
Frank said. “What  we have  here  is 
a syste m tha
t assumes that it has 
the privile ge of studying scientific ally 
anythin g that’s not repatriate d.”
A few weeks after  sending the let-
ter to the Depart ment of the Interior , 
university administrators officially  
withdrew the request, citin g lack of 
sup
port  from the Kumeyaay.
“When  we learne d that the 
Kumayeey  Cultural  Repatriation  
Committee  did not support  the uni-
versity ’s request — sub mitte d to the 
federal  NAGPRA revie w co mmittee  
to repatriate  the remains — the  uni-
versity  withdrew its request,”  UCSD 
spokes
woman Stacie Spector said. 
The skeletons c urrently remain in 
university possession.  
Vice Chan cellor of Resear ch Art 
Ellis is in charge of drawing up a set 
of guidelines for curatin g and study-
ing the bones. E llis was unab le to 
comment as of press  time.
“The next m ove is up to them, ” 
Banegas said. “We’ve put in a number 
of requests and they ’ve denied them. 
We’ll have  to see.”

days [of rest]. I wanted to do what I 
could do to win the ballgame. ”
Entering the game in a tight spot, 
Shibuya enticed the first Emporia State batter he faced to chase a ball down and away for a swinging strikeout. The next Hornet batter drove the Triton pitcher’s 1-2 pitch to center field for a single, but junior outfielder Robert Sedin’s accurate throw to home allowed junior catch-er Kellen Lee to tag the Emporia State runner out at the plate. The outfield assist was UCSD’s second in the game, and saved the Tritons a run.
“The outfield assists were legit, ” 
Tanner said. “They were huge in kill-ing momentum for the other team and there aren’t many things that are more exciting than throwing out guys at the plate. ”
With two out and runners on 
first and second, Emporia State drove another single to center field. This time, however, Sedin’s throw was up the line and the Hornets took a 3-1 lead.
With their season on the line and 
only four innings left in the game, the Tritons took back a run in the fourth on an RBI single from Cantele that plated senior second baseman Garrett Imeson.
In the top of the eighth, Sedin 
erased UCSD’s deficit by scoring from third base on a passed ball.
“We have been doing it all year, ” 
Tanner said of the Tritons’ numerous late-inning comebacks. “We never give up and we scratch and claw until the final out. We thrive on other teams getting tight under pressure and taking advantage of their mis-takes. ”
The game was locked in a 3-3 
tie when Emporia State came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth against Shibuya. The Hornets led the inning with a walk from third baseman Kevin Wempe before the Tritons induced a popup for the first out. Hornet right fielder Caleb Williamson singled to center field and — as Sedin threw the ball to third trying to tag the lead run-ner — attempted to take second base. But Williamson was unable to catch the Tritons off guard, and Tanner quickly threw to second to catch the runner in a pickle for the second out.
With a runner on third base, 
O’Brien called on his closer — soph-omore Guido Knudson — to pre-serve the tie and send the game into extra innings. But Lane quelled those hopes, hitting the walk-off homer.
“I was shocked because it honestly 
had never even crossed my mind that we would lose, ” Cantele said. “Our team was so close and confident that I was almost conditioned to believing that we would win. ”
Despite falling short of a national 
championship, it was a year of firsts for the Tritons. UCSD won its first regular-season California Collegiate Athletic Association title and claimed 
its first regional championship, earn-ing a spot at the College World Series.
“It was a great experience and one 
that I am going to remember for the rest of my life, ” Cantele said of playing at nationals. “The atmosphere of the games were great, our fans were out-standing as always and you could not ask to play on a nicer field than the U.S. national training center. ”
Not only did they clinch a berth in 
the College World Series, the Tritons played well enough throughout the season to enter as the No. 1 seed.
“This is the best club that UC 
San Diego has ever had, ” O’Brien said in a statement.  “It’s one thing to be talented, but it’s another to have guys that battle for one anoth-er.  This is a group of guys I’ d go into a trench with any day of my life. I just couldn’t be more proud of this team and how they competed. They played their hearts out and left everything out on that field.  That’s all you could ask for. ”

Emporia State’s walk-off home run in the national semifinal
cuts short UCSD’s record-breaking year.
It took just one ping of the aluminum bat to halt 
UCSD’s historic run at a Division II title, only three wins shy of a Triton national championship.
No. 1 UCSD’s first trip to the Division-II College 
World Series came to a shocking close in the bottom of the ninth inning in the Tritons’ semifinal game against No. 3 Emporia State University on May 28. 
With two out and a runner on third for Emporia 
State in a tie game, Hornet senior Kellen Lane pow-ered a 0-1 offspeed pitch that hit the scoreboard in right field for a walkoff homer. The long ball was the first of Lane’s career, and it sent UCSD home with a 5-3 defeat.
“We left everything we had on the field, ” senior 
first baseman Matt Cantele said. “Y eah, we had our chances to put some more runs on the board, but so did they. All in all, some people really stepped up. [Sophomore pitcher] Tim Shibuya threw everything he had and kept us in the game, [senior third base-man] Josh Tanner was smacking the ball around the yard as usual and we had so me huge outfield assists. 
We played a clean game for the most part. They just got a clutch hit on a good pitch and prevailed. ”
The loss closed the Tritons’ season with a record 
of 41-15. The Hornets advanced to the Division-II National Championship game, where they fell 2-1 to Lynn University.
The Tritons advanced to the semifinal after win-
ning back-to-back elimination contests, and faced another must-win game against Emporia State, which was undefeated in the tournament.
UCSD sent junior Kirby St. John to the mound — 
the team’s fourth starting pitcher of the tournament — while Emporia State opted to pitch junior Colby Killian who started the Hornets’ first College World Series game.After the Tritons went down in order during 
the top of the first, Emporia State led off its half of the inning with a double. The Hornets’ No. 2 batter, attempting to advance his teammate to third, bunted the ball too hard, allowing St. John to throw out the lead runner. 
With the game still scoreless, redshirt junior first 
baseman Brandon Gregorich drew a leadoff walk in the second inning. Gregorich advanced to third base after two groundouts and scored on Cantele’s RBI single to center field. 
Emporia State answered with a run in the third 
inning, using UCSD’s only error in the College World Series to put runners on the corners with no outs. The Hornets took advantage of another UCSD misstep to score on a balk from St. John and tie the game. 
The Hornets got their leadoff man on base in the 
fourth inning as well, when St. John hit catcher Mike Sharp with a pitch. After a failed sacrifice bunt from Emporia State in the next at-bat, Sharp advanced to second on a wild pitch and scored on a single.
With his team down 2-1, St. John walked the first 
batter he faced in the fifth inning. A single from the Hornets put two runners on base with none out, prompting head coach Dan O’Brien to pull his start-ing pitcher from the game.
With his team facing elimination, O’Brien handed 
sophomore Tim Shibuya the ball to take over on the mound. Shibuya, the staff ace, pitched 7.2 innings in UCSD’s opening nationals game on May 24, throw-ing 7.2 innings and allowing three runs while being tagged with the loss.
“I told coach I was ready to go, ” Shibuya said in a 
statement “It didn’t matter if it was two days or 10
