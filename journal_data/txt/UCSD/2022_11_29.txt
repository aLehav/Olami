visit Fair UC Now  (https://www.fairucnow.org/) for more details of the strike.
Today, Nov. 29, UAW Local 5810 announced via email that academic researchers and
postdoctoral scholars have reached a tentative agreement with the University of California
addressing their main concerns regarding wage increases. Despite the provisional agreement,
the 12,000 postdocs and academic researchers will remain on strike in unity with Academic
Student Employees and Student Researchers until they vote on whether or not to ratify the
agreements.
The agreement comes 15 days after the start of the strike that witnessed 48,000 workers
joining across all UC campuses in the largest strike at any academic institution in American
history. 
In a press conference, President of UAW Local 5810 Neal Sweeney revealed that the
ratification vote for the new contracts may be held as early as this week. He also stressed the
importance of the UC matching the demands of the other two units as well. 
“There’s two units that reached agreement, collectively they’re 12,000 workers between the
two units, postdocs and academic researchers,” Sweeney said. “We think the university
should also reach agreements with the other units as soon as possible, once they start to
make those serious proposals, the agreement could be reached relatively quickly and if that
happens all the units can be voting at the same time.”
He went on to say that it’s still a possibility that academic researchers and postdocs will
remain on strike if the other two units have not reached an agreement. 
The new contracts will include a 20–23% salary increase (up to $12,000) by October 2023
for most postdocs and a 29% salary increase for academic researchers. The UC sent an offer
to the union last Wednesday, Nov. 23. The union countered their offer on Monday, Nov. 28,
which the UC accepted later that day.
Recording Secretary of academic workers  (https://uaw5810.org/leadership/)  Stacy
Frederickat UC Berkeley expressed her approval of the newly added protections. “On this contract, there’s some pretty amazing changes that will help protect not just things
around compensation but to make our workplace one of the most safe and effective spaces in
academia,” Frederick said. “One of the things for both of our units is now we have much
stronger compensation around paid parental and family leave, so now we have eight weeks
100% pay, which is a really big deal for folks who are wanting to start a family while working
here. We have some of the most progressive anti-harassment, anti-bullying information and
language to make our environments and our workplace much safer.” 
The following are other benefits from the new proposed contract, as taken from the Nov. 29
