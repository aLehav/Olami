“Here’s your money back/

Student media heads are threatening legal 
action against A.S. President Utsav Gupta’s for his 
Friday-afternoon decision to freeze all funding to student publications.
Gupta announced Friday morning that he 
wished to pull funding from controversial humor newspaper the Koala,  whose editor in chief made 
a racial slur on Student-Run Television the night before in reference to Black Student Union mem-bers protesting the Feb. 15 “Compton Cookout. ”
“We’ve tried, throughout this year, to redo [the 
media guidelines], and essentially not fund [the Koala ], ” he said at an impromptu meeting. I don’t 
know if it’ll get rid of them, but on the part of A.S., we can defund them — we absolutely can defund them, and I believe we must defund them. ”
Gupta said he had the executive power to 
freeze media-org funding because the current allocation of money for media organizations vio-lates Section II of the A.S. Constitution. The sec-tion states the role of the council is “to create and execute programs which serve the collective inter-ests of the undergraduate population. ” According to Gupta, the current system — which has funded the Koala  since 1982— is hurting students, and 
therefore not serving the collective interest.

Two years after the grand opening 
of Price Center East, University 
Centers officials said they are in the 
final stages of filling the remaining 
store spaces with a bank, coffee shop, and hair salon, as they promised.
Price Center East opened in May 
2008, funded by the Price Center Expansion Referendum — a $39 quarterly student fee enacted in Spring Quarter 2003. Only five vendors have been installed in the space since its opening, leaving three vacant slots.
“The students wanted the best of 
both worlds, ” Assistant Vice  Chancellor of Student Life Gary Ratcliff said. “They wanted an expansion that was going to be large enough to serve the student body when we reached steady state enrollment, and they wanted the fee as low as possible. What that meant is there needed to be other sources of revenue to pay to operate the building, and retail was the answer. ”

Hundreds of students walked 
out of an administration-planned 
teach-in yesterday morning to  attend a counter teach-in organized by the Black Student Union. 
The Feb. 24 Price Center protest 
began with a press conference held 
by the BSU, the student organiza-tion that declared campus climate to be in a “state of emergency” last Friday. The BSU has addressed the 
“toxic” environment with a rally and a list of 32 demands. BSU Chair David Ritcherson called for the UCSD chancellor cabinet to respond to the organization’s demands by March 4 — the same day as a systemwide protest against limited accessibility to higher edu-cation — with a “thorough, written timeline for immediate action. ” 
Press-conference speakers 
included history professor Daniel Widener, who applauded A.S. President Utsav Gupta for his recent decision to freeze funding for all 33 student media organizations, then asked administrators to disregard the current budget crisis in favor of meeting all the BSU’s demands.

denounced Gupta’s actions as uncon-
stitutional, in violation of the First Amendment.   
FIRE sent Gupta a seven-page let-
ter requesting that he end the funding freeze immediately. 
Gupta said he is working with 
UCSD legal counsel.
“I’m not going to bow down to 
threats of litigation, ” he said.
Gregorian said he has contacted 
the ACLU and FIRE, and is work-ing closely with the Student Press Law Center. Although lawyers from these organizations have assured him that they will represent the Koala in court, 
he said he plans to file a grievance with the campus judicial board before involving outside action.  
“We’re essentially trying to resolve 
this issue inside of UCSD first, ” he said.  
Gregorian emphasized that Gupta’s 
actions were unconstitutional because he froze funding due to content.
Gupta has chartered a media review 
board to reevaluate the process of allo-cating funds to student publications. The board consists of seven media-org representatives and seven represen-tatives from the Student Affirmative Action Committee — a diversity-ori-ented group that includes the BSU — along with seven other representatives from various councils and groups.
“If Utsav contends that this is about 
content, not funding, I implore people to ask why SAAC is given the same number of media votes as media [orga-nizations], ” he said. “If this isn’t content-related, why are they even involved?”
Gregorian and Thomas  Dadourian 
— co-manager of the now-defunct SRTV — have been denied access to a number of BSU events.  
Gregorian said he tried to speak 
at the “Open and Honest Dialogue” forum, held in Muir College on Tuesday night by BSU Vice Chair Fnann Keflezighi, but was prevented 
because she didn’t “trust” him.
“They’re allowed to do that since it 
is a private, not university-sanctioned, 
program” he said. “I just think it wasn’t open, or honest. ” 
Because of privacy privileges at 
student-run events, Gregorian said he thought the BSU, by walking out of the university teach-in and holding 
its own, was creating a limited forum 
where opponents could be silenced.  
Dadourian was barred from film-
ing at both the Monday-night BSU meeting and the “Open and Honest Dialogue” forum.  
“I explained to Fnann that it would 
be from an objective viewpoint, ” he said. “She asked the crowd to raise their hands if anyone was uncomfortable 
SO, YEAH, ANYWAYS By Marina Mizar

discussions of our demands, ” Widener said. 
After the press conference ended 
at 11:30 a.m., participants marched from Library Walk to the official teach-in, scheduled to be held at the Price Center East Ballroom. The crowd — which included community members, as well as students from Cal State San Bernandino, San Diego State and the University of Southern California — chanted slogans such as “Real Pain, Real Action” .
Following speeches by theater 
professor Nadine George and LGBT Center director Shaun Travers, A.S. Associate Vice President of Diversity Affairs Jasmine Phillips and BSU Vice Chair Fnann Keflezighi called for the attendees to walk out and attend a counter teach-in instead.
“If you truly care about our uni-
versity, if you want to stand in soli-darity, you will join me in walking out of this teach-in and joining us at our teach-in, ” Keflezighi said.
The majority of participants left 
the room and convened at the stairs above the Triton statue. 
Speakers at the counter teach-
in included Cross-Cultural Center director Edwina Welch. She stressed that the protests were not about indi-vidual acts of racism, but an institu-tional problem. 
“Y ou’ve felt racism if you’ve gone 
down Library Walk and not been handed flyers, if you’ve sat in class and nobody’s sat by you, ” she said. “What gets lost is the day-to-day macro and micro aggression on campus. ”
Literature professor Daniel Childs 
agreed with Welch, condemning the system instead of individuals.
“This is a white-supremacist, rac-
ist, classist, misogynist institution, ” he said. 
Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Niko Arranz, a student protestor, said the counter teach-in was more pow-erful than the one the administration had planned.
“The first teach-in was a joke, ” he 
said. “I was falling asleep because it wasn’t relevant. ”
Keflezighi said she created the 
counter teach-in because she wanted to educate the community according to BSU’s own terms. 
“We were angry when we weren’t 
asked to be part of the [teach-in] planning process, ” she said. 
Vice Chancellor of Student Life 
Penny Rue responded positively to the counter teach-in. 
“I’m delighted that our students 
found the right platform to express themselves today, ” she said. 
She said it was too soon to know 
if all of the demands of the BSU will be met.

The remaining spaces were meant to provide alternative services to students, as outlined in the referendum.
University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino said he plans to install a hair salon on the second level of the building. A coffee shop, scheduled to open next winter, has been assigned to 
the space left of the Sunshine Market. 
A bank — whose name has yet to be released — will open to the right of the Sunshine Market by fall. According to Terzino, of the three, the bank is the furthest along in the planning and contracting stages.
The Department of Student Life 
issued a survey five years ago — before contracting out the spaces — to collect information on student preferences and determine which potential vendors would best accommodate their needs.
“In the spring of 2005, a survey 
was issued to the campus community, ” Terzino said. “Over 4,000 responses came back. The responses from that survey really helped fuel the vendors that were considered in the expansion. ”
Terzino said he worked with 
the University Centers Advisory Board, made up of students and administrators, to negotiate with 
potential businesses.
“The process does take time, 
because we have to essentially figure 
out what would be the best business to go in there, ” UCAB Chair Jordan Taylor said. Once UCAB receives proposals from interested businesses, it 
reviews each one in detail to determine 
its potential.
“We go through a reviewing 
process of all the proposals with the commitee, and then we decide which ones we want to enter into more specific negotiations, ” Taylor said. 
Ratcliff said the process, though 
lengthy, was necessary to ensure student satisfaction.
“The board is very careful, ” Ratcliff 
said.

Graduate students from the UCSD School of Medicine wore lab coats to a Feb. 23 protest against racism, 
carrying banners with slogans such as “Future Doctors Come From Compton.”with being recorded, and no one raised 
their hand. ” 
Dadourian was still denied access, 
though he said other members of the forum were recording videos.
The free-speech issue was discussed 
at the A.S. meeting last night. Various guests — including Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary Ratcliff — asked the council to continue the freeze until new guidelines were created.  
Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch said that the council is also working with legal counsel, who has assured them that the freeze is not a violation of rights because it did not single out the Koala .
“Legal counsel is assuring us that 
there are mechanisms we can put in place so that we do not work against ourselves with hate speech, [simply] because of structures we have in place, ” Benesch said.  
Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Andrew Ang said freez-ing funds is not violating the First Amendment. 
“It’s not our fault they didn’t find 
other sources in previous years, ” he said.
Sixth College Senator John 
Condello disagreed.
“These organizations are funded by 
[the council], so pulling funding [will amount to] silencing them, ” he said. “The answer is more speech, not less. ”
The council voted to maintain the 
funding freeze until discussed by the campus media committee. The com-mittee, open to the public, is meeting tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the A.S. Forum on the fourth floor of Price Center East.

Wednesday, March 3: Biology Workshop  
Thursday, March 4: Verbal Workshop   MARCH 1-4, 2010In light of the day’s teach-ins 
and last week’s student-media funding freeze, the Week 8 
A.S. Council meeting was the most intense of the year so far. 
During public input, individuals 
from both the Black Student Union and media organizations addressed the council in hopes of influencing a future decision on the freeze.
Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Students Affairs Gary Ratcliff  
displayed his contempt for the Koala .
“I’ve seen this 
for 10 years, where you allow student publications to fund hate, ” he said. “Meanwhile, you are watering that weed with $7,000 — let [the Koala ] 
use their own beer money to fund themselves. ” 
Koala  Editor in Chief Kris 
Gregorian  arrived at the meeting 
wielding $20 in pennies to demon-strate that students are free to ask for reimbursement of their fees that go toward the Koala .
As the council motioned to move 
to New Business, it voted to maintain the temporary freeze and discuss the topic at the campus media review committee meeting 8 p.m. Thursday.
Next, Student-Run Television co-
manager Thomas Dadourian  begged 
the council to reopen the station. 
Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo  said the SRTV shutdown paled 
in comparison to larger issues.
“Y our voice may be silenced tem-
porarily, but as a student of color on this campus, my voice is silenced per-manently, ” she said.
The motion to reinstate SRTV’s 
charter, with an amendment banning live shows, failed.
AVP of Diversity Affairs Jasmine Phillips  spoke to AVP of Academic 
Affairs and Pi Kappa Alpha member Jordan Taylor regarding the racial 
incident at their meeting Sunday.
“PIKE is not taking accountability, 
they just attempt to cover their own asses, ” Phillips said. “But they have had a lack of action and a nonchalant attitude. ”
Taylor  was visibly shaking and 
upset as he lis-tened to Phillips’ speech. 
Last week, 
councilmembers moved to cre-ate a committee to bridge the 
gap between the Greek community and the Student Affirmative Action Committee, but did not determine how the council would oversee the committee.  
This week, council voted to insti-
tute Briana Boyd  from Counseling 
and Psychological Services as the committee’s chair. 
During member reports, 
Campuswide Senator Adam Kenworthy announced he would not wear shoes for two weeks to raise money for Partners in Health and Haiti relief.
President Utsav Gupta  informed 
the council that the Graduate Student Association failed the University Centers CPI referendum that the council passed last week.  
VP of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch excitedly announced 
that the Grove Cafe will take dining dollars starting in spring.
And, as always, what would an 
A.S. meeting be without the repeat-ed issue of council accountability? 
After a relatively brief debate, 
councilmembers voted to impeach Sixth College Senator Kevin

Thanks to the work of Dr. William 
Gerwick at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, UCSD’s nine libraries and three million books will soon have a new baby sibling: the SIO collection.
Gerwick, along with George 
Nicola, a postdoctoral scholar at Skaggs School of Pharmacy, plans to open the Scripps Natural Compounds Library by 2012 in order to stream-line the way drug companies obtain research material. The library — which will be comprised of marine plant samples, animals and bacteria — already contains over 50,000 speci-mens waiting to be catalogued.
Gerwick first envisioned the 
project five years ago, when he came across the work of late marine chemis-try professor John Faulkner. Faulkner left behind a vast collection of com-pounds, collected from locations around the world like Madagascar, Papua New Guinea and Fiji; however, they were highly disorganized, lacking proper catalogue and supervision.
“I realized what an asset we have 
here at SIO and UCSD, but how poor-ly we manage it, ” Gerwick said. “For the long vision, it would be of enor-mous value to the institution to have a large and well-curated compound collection. ”
Gerwick said he hopes to orga-
nize the collection of natural and synthetic compounds within the next two years — readying it for use, espe-cially, by pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, Gerwick has asked for sample donations from scientists at Scripps and other institutions who might want to contribute to the grow-ing collection. 
Gerwick said the completed 
library should allow drug compa-nies to avoid the laborious process of obtaining individual compounds, which can mean excessive paperwork and legal complications. For example, each time a pharmaceutical company requests to use a compound from a different institution, it must create a legal agreement for its application, including a system of payment. 
According to 
Nicola, easy access to compounds gives pharmaceutical companies flex-ibility to examine new compounds on a budget, and encourages them to work with UCSD. In particular, Nicola said the library’s location at the ocean-ography institute will aid marine-oriented research.
“The most important aspect of this 
screening library is that they originate from very rare marine sources, ” Nicola said. “In this sense, it will revolution-ize scientific drug discovery by tap-ping into the unique biodiversity that is intrinsic to these rare species. ”
One of the most prominent syn-
thetic compounds in the collection is cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae. These photosynthetic bacteria  — which are generated by Scripps scien-tists in the lab after cyanobacteria are collected in the field  — could be the source of bioactive products, used in medical disciplines like the neurosci-ences, bacteriology and oncology.
In January, the Scripps-Y oung 
President’s Organization Innovation Challenge awarded the collection a $10,000 cash prize because of the library’s potential contributions to the field of medicine. 
The Scripps library will not 
generate profit for the university. Gerwick said he is aiming to create a self-sustaining facility, and accord-ing to Nicola, it will create ties with academic laboratories and drug com-panies interested in working with the collection. 
“Hopefully this will simulate a 
company with a different idea for the good of society, ” Gerwick said. “This library shows that there are other ways to develop drugs, and once we build it, [the scientists] will come. ”

Political Action Conference came to a close last week — a moment car-ried by the impassioned chalkboard stylings of self-proclaimed rodeo clown Glenn Beck — I immediately hit the John. I had just witnessed three days of extremist anger, the inklings of anti-establishment upheaval and a staggering array of pinstriped suiting. I had seen House Minority Leader John Boehner predict a fast-approaching political rebellion. I had watched soft-spoken Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty swing an imaginary golf club as he “smashed the windows” of big gov-ernment. I had listened as Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) proclaimed that the American people were ready to go to battle against the Democratic Party. 
Battle? Rebellion? Smash? 
Window? What was going on here? Why were elected officials alluding to violent political uprising? Since when did frothing at the mouth become an acceptable mode of political com-munication? And why were people buying big posters of Anne Coulter in a suggestive pose? Is Anne Coulter hot now? When the hell did Anne Coulter become hot?
I was going to be in the bathroom 
for a while.
It’s apparent that a lot of people 
in this country are exceptionally pissed off with our government at the moment, and with good reason. Apart from this week’s miraculous passage of the “jobs, jobs, jobs” bill, Congress has pretty much grinded to a stubborn partisan standstill. Combine that with our flailing economy, a sustained national fear of terrorism and an executive propos-ing nearly a trillion dollars in new spending over the next 10 years, and you’re bound to get a few folks riled up. Some of them might even dress up in three-cornered hats and shoes with buckles — a look I have always wished I could pull off.
But what these worried masses 
seem to forget is that our country is not a dictatorship or a military state and that our president is not a 
totalitarian communist neo-liberal 
monarch, as certain talk show hosts/political rabble rousers would have us believe. We’re living in a democracy, here, and a pretty good one at that. There’s no need to load up your guns. There’s no need to incite a rebellion. Voting and peaceful demonstrations work just as well. The violent rhetoric that so many conservative icons are 
tossing around at the moment is dan-
gerous. It’s the kind of language that drives people to do crazy, desperate things in the name of some elusive condition called “freedom. ”
We have freedom. What we don’t 
have is toilet paper. Damnit, Peter.REZA FARAZMAND

The question of whether we 
should enforce affirmative action at the University of 
California — one of the most conten-tious and drawn-out issues of our generation — has never been more relevant. 
Y esterday, approximately 400 stu-
dents from the Southern California area joined in a Black Student Union-led protest to address racism on cam-pus. They asked Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to comply with a list of demands that would increase outreach efforts on campus, expressing hurt and alienation over the frat-affiliated “Compton Cookout” party and the racial slur made on Koala TV last Thursday.
Though BSU is correct in believing 
it must attack underrepresentation by way of changed policy, not all of their demands are fiscally feasible. There’s only so much funding Chancellor Fox can put aside for a resource center or an art space after systemwide cuts have left us with mere scraps of an already depleted budget. However, we can more realistically attack the problem at its source by immediately tweaking our admissions process.
Of course, it isn’t legal to con-
sider race in admissions just yet. But, thanks to the actions of student-based coalition “By Any Means Necessary, ” that might change. Earlier this month, BAMN filed a class-action lawsuit to overturn Proposition 209 — the 
1996 law that banned affirma-tive action at all California public universi-ties. According to the organiza-tion, because of the precedent set by 2003 Supreme Court case Grutter 
v. Bollinger — 
which declared affirmative action both nec-
essary and legal — BAMN has a good chance of overturning Prop. 209.
We hope that’s the case, and urge 
students to funnel whatever energy they have after parading Price Center’s perimeters this year and channel it into helping level the playing field at a legislative level.
The fewer minority students there 
are at UCSD, the more other students will think events like the Cookout are no big deal. Without a challenge to the privileged point of view, the more graduates we release to the world without a trace of cultural sensitivity.
While we’re waiting on BAMN’s 
lawsuit, however, we recommend that the university do what it can within its limitations. Currently, all UC campuses save UCLA and UC Berkeley make admissions decisions based on a comprehensive system that awards each applicant a certain number of points according to his or her academic record, economic status and personal achievements. At UCSD specifically, an applicant’s academic record makes up for 74 percent of his or her score — meaning those who don’t earn enough points based on their GPA or SAT scores won’t even get a chance to be reviewed for per-sonal achievements.The holistic review that UCLA and 
Berkeley use, however, avoids forcing a value on any one aspect of an appli-cation, and assesses candidates based on all factors of their application. Even

I would like to thank everyone for their support, and for standing in solidarity with the commu-
nity against hate speech and for the human right to be respected.
At first, I felt really discouraged 
because it felt like many people were supporting this ill-intentioned “free speech, ” and were so reluctant to sympathize with the racial hostility 
that I and many others on this cam-
pus have felt because of — and even before — these incidents. 
But after Feb. 24, 2010, I am 
more than confident that there are many non-ignorant people here at UCSD who, like me, realize the necessity of mutual respect in a public space shared by a variety of people of many affiliations and backgrounds. We stand in solidarity against these acts of hate, and will not tolerate them on this campus or any other publicly social atmosphere of our community — that includes Facebook and public fraternity 
activities.
The “Compton Cookout” invita-
tion and party is a perfect example 
of externalizing subconsciously internalized stereotypes of American black culture, taken from the media and used as comedy for a party in celebration of Black History Month. For those who do not take this month seriously, this may have 
seemed like a harmless and humor-
ous excuse to throw a party. Y et for others, it was horrifying; for those that understand Black History Month as a time to honor American black culture in ceremony of respect and appreciation, and a time to recognize suffering and accomplish-ments, this party was disrespectful on so many levels.
Even if it had not been the month 
of February, the event would have still been disrespectful, because 
the invitation and party itself was 
a mockery of low socio-economic status and a degradation of Black women. Imitation is a form of flattery and respect, a way of high-lighting positive characteristics — but mockery is intended to be offensive, and shows an ignorant lack of respect for the subjects one is portraying. As a black woman, I 
was appalled, and honestly do not feel entirely safe walking around a 
campus where people could find it within their capacity to base a party on misogyny and malicious stereo-types.
This so-called representation of 
black culture by a group of fraternity members was based on their limited knowledge of it, and just goes to show how ignorant they truly are about the black community.  Am I really surrounded by such unedu-
cated people? 
I can still hear it. “Well, if black 
people weren’t so offended and 
accepted it as a joke, there wouldn’t be a problem. ” This “joke” implies all poor black people are uneducated and animalistic, with no manners. :PTVUL>PSZVU

The fewer 
minority students there are at UCSD, the more other students will think events like the Cookout are no big deal.OPINION THURSDAY , FEBRUARY 25, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 
Dear Editor, 
As educators, advisors and out-
reach professionals who work off 
campus in historically marginal-ized communities, TRIO Outreach Programs is sending this open letter in solidarity with the Black Student Union and others who are expressing their frustrations, and are asking for immediate action.  An outrageously racist party took place, UCSD students were involved and we expect those students to be held accountable for their gross violations. We also acknowledge that there is a larger systemic problem with the campus climate at UCSD that has to be addressed, as expressed in a recent statement from Dr. Jorge Mariscal and Dr. Patrick Velasquez.  
With respect, we think the 
campus should take the following measures to continue to address this larger issue of continued hostility toward communities of color:
Budget decisions — Programs 
that serve underrepresented stu-dents should be given consideration to the value that they add to the campus, and these programs need to be considered as part of the larg-er goal of promoting diversity.
Admissions policies — The 
recent W ASC recommendations included efforts to implement a holistic approach for UCSD, and we encourage the university to take steps in this critical aspect of looking at what types of students’ comprehensive life experiences the campus values. 
Develop a major for African 
American and Chicana/o Studies — Majors and minors which promote interdisciplinary research and study in fields such as African American Studies and Chicana/o Studies will make significant progress toward demonstrating the university’s priority in the attraction of and retention of historically underrepre-sented communities.
Student initiated programs — 
Every effort needs to be taken to develop, support and maintain the recently developed Student Promoted Access Center for Education and Service.
Create a social justice and com-
munity building taskforce — The university should provide a com-prehensive space so that a variety of people from various units, depart-ments and expertise can contribute to taking concrete steps to address the need to build and sustain social justice and community building efforts at UCSD. These efforts could focus on the critical needs of his-torically underrepresented popula-tions.
It is imperative that we send a 
strong message to those commu-nities that have been historically excluded from higher education that this is their campus, too.
— Carri Fierro 
Director, UCSD TRIO
Outreach Programs
Dear Editor,
As an alumnus and faculty 
member, I am saddened by the mean-spirited actions recently directed toward the black com-munity, and especially attempts to justify behavior that was demeaning to members of our community. I see these actions as those of a small, if, say, an applicant’s academic SAT score is low because he couldn’t afford a prep course or find time to study while helping his parents pay the bills, his evaluators would still be able to consider him based on other merits. Accordingly, UCLA and Berkeley have more than double, almost triple, our 1.3 percent of black students. 
And let’s face it. The way we deal 
with everyday challenges almost always says more about our ability to learn and adapt to difficult situations (i.e. blazing through with two weeks of midterms on top of a part-time job) than the grade you weaseled out in AP History.
It’s true that such a prestigious institution of higher learning as UCSD should value academic record very highly in the admissions pro-cess. But if you really think about it, no matter how many worksheets on chemical titration you filled out in high school, you probably don’t remember any of it now. Y our high-school resume often has more to do with the resources and encourage-ment you received — opportunities far from equal in California’s fund-biased education system.
So, we hope that Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Admissions Mae Brown means it when she says that her department will be launching a pilot program incorporating holis-tic review next year. Far more than punishing frat boys or student media, a new system would foster campus diversity and, therefore, awareness. 
Our student population is in a 
state of obvious disproportionality — one for which no safe space nor free tutoring session can compensate. Starting-line coexistance is the only answer. If UCSD were to eventually incorporate a form of affirmative action into its admissions process, should Prop. 209 be overturned, the holistic system would be more likely to ensure that applicants aren’t simply receiving points for race, in isolation from experience. Rather, race could be considered within the context of any other strengths or weaknesses, advan-tages or disadvantage.

By Gretchen Wegrich
Staff Writer
It may be grim, but there’s 
enough humor in Anton Chekhov’s dark comedy “The 
Seagull, ” this week’s headliner at Mandell Weiss Forum, that you can leave your Prozac at home. Silly and sad, it’s perfect date fod-der for a mismatched couple.
Konstantin, a young and unap-
preciated playwright, is at the center of a messy love pentagon that wreaks havoc in his small lakeside community — but their amorous and ridiculous down-fall is so hilarious that it’s easy to forget that things are going to pieces, distractions ranging from red Speedos to upbeat musical blowouts.
Although sometimes jarring, 
these periodic song-and-instru-ment interruptions provide a much-appreciated escape from the play’s increasingly grim develop-ments.
But it’s the thought-provoking 
commentary on art that makes the first act so appealing. When Konstantin tries to push the boundaries of theatrical structure by removing all plot and charac-ters, “The Seagull” tiptoes around irony, suggesting the plot-and-character-driven theater we were watching was too conventional to be considered interesting or art.   
The much shorter second act 
dives into a deep, dark depression. A number of years have passed, and the characters’ vibrantly colored costumes give way to grays and blacks.
Although Konstantin and his 
companions have followed their dreams, nothing seems to have turned out the way they once hoped. Each has learned the hard way that you can’t just ignore an impossible love, no matter how you may try.
As the 
play veers toward its dark end, the cast struggles to maintain the holiday atmosphere that once pervaded their lives, wondering what will come of their uncertain lives.
Driven by complex 
personalities that are alternately proud, vain, miserable, flirtatious, discouraged, jealous, passionate and desperately in love, “Seagull” boasts neither villain nor protagonist — just a motley mix 
of character flaws, each relatable in its way. Dugdale successfully adapts Chekhov’s play with a zest of modern context and 
zinging musical talent. Stage lighting adds subtle visual context to the emotional weight of each scene, while a crafty set leaves space open for the characters to romp through to their unhappy endings.
If you’ve never experienced a Mandeville Center cultural event, consider giving conceptual artist 
Lauren Woods’ multimedia exhibit “M(other)land” a quick peek the next time you find yourself near Main Gym. 
While the messages behind 
some of her videos and images are sometimes hard to grapple, a long look at the new exhibit reveals the Bay Area artist’s fascination with the identity of power that sur-rounds the American perspective of Africa.

In her latest single, Kate Nash 
puts a psychedelic twist on her 
Joan Jett ’tude, layering enough 
power and effects to crack our 
skulls open. A complete 180 from her folksy debut, the track’s watery bass slithers behind Nash’s hazy and echoed voice as the guitars scrape out a riff trippy enough to give David Gilmour flashbacks. She launches the choruses into freak-out territory with wordless, glass-shattering shrieks, keeping the broken-brain train rolling from 
verse to verse.
Even though Nash’s psychedelic 
grit stings, if the alternative is one 
of a thousand sweet, synthetic divas — hell, I’ll admit it: I prefer it rough and ragged.

The guitar-and-drums simplic-ity of the Japandroids’ new “ Art Czars” harkens back to high

hometown mediocrities littering 
MySpace, Japandroids’ Post-Nothing 
— a noise-rock riposte to the flood of electronic indie-rock — is one of the most acclaimed albums of 2009. The raucous, snarky track has the band repeatedly chanting lines like, “Here’s your money back/ Here’s your punk rock back. ” It’s almost embarrassingly angst-ridden, but Japandroids make it so catchy it’s sort of forgivable. Plus, they’re com-

For a band that made 
a mark with a power-metal portrayal of the 
Hiroshima ruins by the name of “Black Rain, ” Astral Doors’ new Requiem of Time  
is as forgettable as the parade of Black Sabbath vocalists after Dio left. The Swedish rockers plod through same-speed grinding rhythms ripped straight from classic fantasy-metal bands, and every twist — like the pre-solo acoustic breakdown in “Blood River” — is 100 percent expected. No mat-ter how carefully you listen, there’s none of the awe and mysticism that transformed the classics from just plain heavy into metal. 
Even instrumentally, 
the album can’t distinguish itself: Mike Itäranta’s bass is turned so low that he might as well be six feet under, while the twin guitarists trade tentative solos, reluc-tant to leave their comfy power-chord rhythms. Instead, an electro-clink keyboard takes the lead on “The Healer, ” but rather than serving as a roaring foundation for the track, it just fills an empty space.
The only member of 
Astral Doors who really taps into the power of metal is vocalist Nils Johansson, whose forceful singing dominates “Call of the Wild” with Dio’s brand of commanding, condemning contralto. With a little more imagination, his voice could make Astral Doors the next Judas Priest, but his range is wasted on trite, overdone metal anthems with names like “Testament of Rock. ” Especially in a world where most of heavy metal’s god-fathers are still putting out fresh and deadly tracks, why bother with a cheap knock-off that’s stuck in 1979?

Swedish Metalheads Need SteelALBUMREVIEW
gallery, peaceful choral music fills our ears, the only presence in a spacious white room. If you can resist the urge to curl up in the corner and sleep off last night’s party, your eyes will be drawn to several screens.
To your left is a large projection of 
hip-hop king Ludacris haloed by golden light, superimposed on a stereotypi-cal African backdrop — grass huts, an elephant, a kneeling woman holding a basket and a tribal warrior with a spear. Woods asks us to deconstruct our media-influenced stereotypes of Africa, while Ludacris’ shirt us a resonating Marcus Garvey quote: “ A people without knowl-edge of its past is like a tree without roots. ” 
Working your way clockwise around 
the room, you’ll find the back corner partitioned off. There, a double projec-tion in blue, black and white features a Hollywood-constructed image of stampeding African men in loincloths. Because it’s projected onto two walls at a right angle, it looks like the horde is run-ning directly toward us.
It’s not immediately recognizable, but 
the installation is also interactive: Y ou can add your own twist to the exhibit by standing in front of the projector. Just make sure the curator doesn’t catch you fooling around with your shadow. 
Further along the back wall are two 
blurry nature photographs, each with a black rectangle obscuring part of the image. Headphones provide an eclectic safari-inspired soundtrack for your lis-tening pleasure. The obscure handful of stimuli could mean a lot of things, but the gallery brochure explains that these photographs are part of the “Vortex” series: a response and reformulation of “the idea of Africa. ” 
The back of the gallery contains sev-
eral more “Vortex” pieces to fall into, while a dark back room juxtaposes dis-turbing screams and flashing machine-gun recordings. The installation’s final eye-catcher is a five-screen setup that displays clips of the African coastline as portrayed by Western media.
Known for her multidisciplinary work 
combining video, sound, installation and photography to deconstruct pop culture, race and other social constructs, Woods’ “M(other)land” is no exception — and it’s the first time her body of work, known as “The Africa Archives, ” has been shown all together. Don’t miss it. 
The artist will give a talk about her 
work on March 2 at 6:30 p.m. in the VAF Performing Arts Space. “M(other)land” will be on display Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. until March 20.

wispy harmonies for a minute and a bit before fading out. When their debut LP drops later this year, indie big leagues will be touting their name.
The Morning Benders . These pop 
youngsters opened for Girls at the Loft last December, but they’ve been around for a few years culling Shins-heavy jangles up in SF. Their second record, Big Echo, as 
fellow columnist Philip Rhie put it, “is like Veckatimest’s  bastard child, ” but in the best 
possible way. Grizzly Bear’s bassist, Chris Taylor, produced the new recordings and it shows — the reverb-heavy toms, crunchy guitar tones and ghost-harmonizing of lead single “Promises” spins Bear for the California beach set. They might not be the most original outfit, but they’ve got pop on lock.
Hudson Mohawke. And now the wild-
card outlier: England’s precocious producer Ross Birchard, aka Mohawke, comes from the same cartoon sugar-cereal generation as Flying Lotus and Nosaj Thing, with video-games and commercial jingles on the brain. His Warp Recs debut Butter blends Flying Lotus beat-chopping with Dan Deacon’s hyper chipmunk aesthetic, using cheesy synth lines and cracked-out vox samples to dizzying effect. He’s also mastered the ’90s slow jam, employing Dam-Funk’s sultry vocal prowess on techno-soul banger “Tell Me What Y ou Want From Me. ” This young Brit may have some crossover appeal — FlyLo’s doing a track with Thom Y orke this year, so who knows, HudMo might get Weezy or Gucci on a verse someday.
Oneohtrix Point Never. What! How do 
you pronounce that? I have no idea. What I do know about this mysterious project is the brain’s name, Daniel Lopatin, whose style is barren synth ambience overloaded for headphone-listening pleasure. Imagine if Y anni circuit-bent his ’80s keyboard arsenal until it sounded in-the-red crispy, then composed the soundtrack to “2001: A Space Odyssey. ” Tracks like “Physical Memory” evoke the Mad Max desert future we all secretly hope California won’t become. This artist may never reach an audience outside of niche drone and electronic circles, but his newest collection Rifts  is years ahead of its time.

e-mail: opinion@ucsdguardian.orgdisrespectful minority. I do not 
know if these actions are protected by free speech, but they clearly vio-late our principles of community. More importantly, they do not rep-resent the UCSD I know. 
I teach a large, sophomore-level 
course in which students work closely together in teams. These teams are randomly assigned, and I have seen students from all backgrounds work respectfully and effectively together. We have students from varied cultural back-grounds, many whose first language is not English, and many who did not have the benefit of privileged high schools. As a whole, students treat each other with respect — regardless of their backgrounds — and strive to create a positive student experience at UCSD. When members of our community have been demeaned, it is the respon-sibility of all of us to stand up and reaffirm our commitment to a respectful environment. The admin-istration’s actions are important, but even more critical are the actions of the UCSD community as a whole to demonstrate the best of the UCSD that I know.
 — Nathan Delson
Academic Coordinator,

Dear Editor,
As members of the department 
of ethnic studies at the University of San Diego, we would like to express our outrage over the recent “Compton Cookout” party. We do not pretend that UCSD is alone in having such incidents occur on its campus; all campuses in the county can probably point to such events. However, we believe that such hurt-ful incidents can become teachable moments and lead to serious dis-cussions about the lack of diversity on our campuses, the ongoing pres-ence of racism, classism, heterosex-ism and the factors fueling this kind of stereotyping and bias.
As serious as the brutal ste-
reotyping of the party invitation was, equally disturbing was the response. On a local radio show, callers assured the hosts that this was “light humor” and “youthful ignorance. ” 
We would like to suggest some 
ways to move the discourse away from denial and the temptation to minimize by university administra-tors:
1) In this post civil rights era, 
racist joking and humor are impor-tant ways that racism is passed on and “taught. ” These attitudes are learned and support the continu-ation of US racial hierarchies and inequities. Those who challenge these notions are ridiculed as being “PC” or having no sense of humor. Such “humor” forms occasions for bonding for our young men (and some women).
2) We remain stuck if we con-
tinue to discuss these images in a historical way. Are we to believe that racism against blacks has noth-ing to do with slavery, legal Jim Crow segregation, racial profiling and the like? To say so inspires the deep despair we saw in UCSD’s black students who were cynical that anything would be done about the incident. As long as they know this history and the majority of students do not, we will continue to speak past each other.
3) There is a persistent effort to 
deny any pattern with such inci-dents. People assert that UCSD is a good place and that these are only a few bad apples (or even not-so-bad apples). This directly contradicts the evidence. There is a national spate of such “parties. ” Boston College’s student newspaper, the Heights , has listed dozens of such 
parties. A “Ghetto Party” at a Texas university encouraged revelers to wear blackface and brandish guns. One wonders who is hosting all these events — just “rich kids” as the UCSD flyer notes?
4) There is cynicism and despair 
over the denial cited above and the lack of consequences. There is ample evidence that these are not isolated incidents, but rather national trends. Johns Hopkins University suspended a fraternity for its “Halloween in the Hood” party.
We encourage all San Diego 
county colleges and universities to use this event as a teachable moment and one with consequenc-es. We are also deeply concerned about the effect of biased-related incidents on university enrollment for underrepresented groups; both UCSD and USD have black enroll-ments under two percent. Finally, we join with you in dialoguing about these critical issues of hostile environment and lack of access to higher education.

7XXWZ\]VQ\aNWZ/ZW_\PAny realistic person would interpret 
this as extreme sarcasm — a rhe-torical device used here to express contempt for black American cul-ture. This was subconsciously abu-sive behavior toward members of another race, or subliminal racism. 
Please realize that negative 
media representations produced about minority subjects are patri-archal tools that perpetuate their oppression. Maybe if students were better educated in ethnic studies, or actually went out and affiliated themselves with other communi-ties, they would understand that our oppression is real, and our pain is real. Stop contributing to the backbone of an institution that functions on injustice and inequal-ity. Whiteness is not the problem — our entire capitalistic society is the problem. But when you add fuel to the engine, you make yourself part of the problem. 
The event created a hostile 
environment (although it was not on campus, it was hosted by UCSD students for UCSD students, so it reflects directly on the school) for a minority already underwhelming underrepresented and marginal-ized in this area. Because of this unreceptive treatment by the few who seem to doubt that the party was insolent and fail to sympathize, we have become marginalized even more. The UCSD community should be shocked that it is contrib-uting to the oppression of minori-ties in 2010.
My only relief is that the situ-
ation has remained relatively civil and no one has been hurt, because in such aggressive atmospheres, vio-lence is often inevitable. I’ d bet that if violent behavior had occurred, people would not be calling it a “joke” anymore; they would realize that the words on the party invita-tion and on Koala TV were fighting words, and not anything to be toyed with. Please, think of the conse-
quences of your actions, and take accountability for them.
Though 
hostility was not intended, the Compton Cookout initi-ated racial hostilities for the personal gain of enjoy-ment (at the expense, mind you, of many others’ subju-gation), and is 
historically known as racism — aka hate speech. In challenge to the First Amendment, words that “by their very nature, involve danger to the public peace” become unconstitu-tional (Justice Sanford, 1925 Gitlow 
v. New York .) I ask for support 
from my peers in achieving and retaining this peace by supporting the demands of the Black Student Union, which aim at stemming the intimidating climate of UCSD toward minorities and making this campus all of our campus. I have had enough of this shit, I will not get over it, and because you don’t think it is a big deal, I will make it a big fucking deal. I may only be part of 1.3 percent of this campus, but I matter. I will not give up.

To ﬁnd out how, just go to:  zone, throwing more balls rather 
than strikes. 
“We needed to make them go 
fishing, ” Gerckens said.
Experienced sophomore pitcher 
Camille Gaito and Zankich adjusted well to the changes, allowing only one Pioneer run. 
“It was a little rocky in the first 
game, but I just went out there with good confidence and made solid pitches, ” Gaito said. “With the run support in these games, we came together as a team. ”
Later in the sixth inning, UCSD 
scored again, plating two runs from just three hits. Junior outfielder Kris Lesovsky’s double to left field and senior catcher Nicole Saari’s triple down the infield line sent Lesovsky home.
Freshman infielder Nicole 
Spangler’s single down the infield line sent junior outfielder Lyndsay Gaylord home. Zankich shut out the last of the Pioneers for a 3-1 Triton victory.  “It was good to see both pitchers 
on the mound throwing great pitches, ” Gerckens said.
The softball team’s experienced 
players had developed a workman-like attitude by the third game of the series on Feb. 20. 
Fierce pitching from Gaito 
allowed East Bay only five hits and five players on base all game.
UCSD broke out the bats in the 
fourth inning. Nicole Saari’s single to right field after Kris Lesovsky’s triple to right field sent Lesovsky home. Gaylord’s double to the left center eventually brought her home from freshman infielder Dyanna Imoto’s bunted single. Senior shortstop Mandi Eliades’
 and 
Lesovsky’s singles brought Gabriel home, giving UCSD the last run of the game for a 3-1 win. 
“We did a better job of executing 
our plays and had better defense, ” Lesovsky said.
Going into the fourth game 
errorless, the Tritons’ energy waned, causing them to commit errors that gave the Pioneers their first win of the four-game series.
An error from the Tritons gave 
East Bay its first run in the second inning, and by the sixth inning, the Pioneers held the lead 4-1.
The Tritons’ late rally in 
the seventh inning brought the difference down to one run, and groundouts from Eliades and Lesovsky ended the game 3-4. 
“We waited too long in the fourth 
game, ” Lesovsky said. “We just need to come off hitting early and leave less players on base. ”
The team will start its eight-
game road trip at Rohnert Park facing off against Sonoma State for a two-day doubleheader from Feb. 26 to Feb. 27. Sonoma State is currently 3-1 in CCAA and 7-3 overall.
“We are starting to play higher-
ranked teams, and so we just need to prepare to take them on, ” Gerckens said.

▶ SOFTBALL, MYVTWHNL
JOHN HANACEK/G UARDIAN
The UCSD softball team will rely on a stellar pitching staff to lead their road games against Sonoma State University and San Francisco State.John clamped down after allowing four early runs to the Wildcats, pitching into the seventh inning with the lead.
He was followed by senior 
reliever Eric Abraham, who quickly allowed two Wildcat runners on base — warranting his substitution for sophomore reliever Elias Tuma.
Tuma entered the game at a tense 
a 7-7 game, with the bases loaded and one out in the top half of the second.
He answered the call brilliantly, 
escaping the inning after inducing a 1-2-3 double play and leaving the game all tied up.
In the bottom half of the eighth, 
Saul started things off for UCSD with a walk. Senior outfielder Chris Fung advanced Saul to first on a grounder, and after senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich was intentionally walked, a double steal by Saul and Gregorich put Triton men on second and third. 
After Kehoe was hit by a pitch, 
Benton stepped up to the plate with bases loaded and came through for UCSD with a sacrifice fly to center, propelling the Tritons to an 8-7 win and series split.
“One thing that we did very well was never giving up, ” Lee said. “We were down a few runs at one point in each game, and we continuously fought back to make it [a] closer game, and even took the lead. That is one thing that exemplifies our program as a whole. We never let down, whether we are winning or losing. ”
Tritons now sit at 11-3 overall 
and 2-2 in CCAA action. Chico State stands at 6-2 in CCAA play.
The Tritons will complete 
their homestand as they continue conference action against Cal State Monterey Bay University.
The Tritons then bring their string 
of successes up against the Otters.
Last season, the Tritons managed 
to win all four games in Seaside. The first pitch of the series is slotted for 2 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 26 at Triton Ballpark. 
“ All we need to do is take care of 
the baseball on defense and capitalize on the offensive opportunities we have, ” Lee said. “When we play the way we can, and stick to our overall approach as a team, we will be pretty tough to beat moving forward in the season. ”

“I’m just not playing as well as I’m 
used to, ” he said.
It wasn’t just Okasaki that strug-
gled — senior Raj Samra, the team’s No. 2 golfer, finished five strokes behind Okasaki in a tie for 50th place. 
Junior Richard Morris, sopho-
more Mike Neustadt and freshman Anubhav Rastogi, all participating in the event for the first time, struggled in their maiden outing.
“ A lot of our guys haven’t seen this 
type of course before, ” Okasaki said. “We don’t have anything like it in San Diego. The other teams in the field 
usually play this type of course so they were expected to shoot better scores. ”
UCSD will head to the two-day 
Cal State San Bernardino Invitational on March 1.
With the weather forecast predict-
ing heavy rains over the weekend, Wydra is just hoping to play a full 54-hole event.
“We’re getting pretty used to the 
rain gear and umbrellas, ” he said. “There’s a chance we’ll lose out on our practice round on Sunday, but if we get to play 54 holes, that would be a real treat. ”

GOLF — Instead of fighting for a posi-
tion on the board, the UCSD men’s golf team found themselves fighting each other — with snowballs — on Feb. 23. A thick layer of snow blanketed the Grey Rock Golf Club in Austin, Tex., forcing officials to cancel the final round of the St. Edwards Invitational.
Battling the elements, UCSD fin-
ished in 12th place in a field of 14, with a 65-over-par score. Junior Keith Okasaki finished in a tie for 28th place. 
This is the third event in the Triton 
season shortened due to weather condi-tions. Rain plagued both the InterWest Wildcat Classic and the Sonoma State Invitational last October — but snow was a new challenge for head coach Mike Wydra the team.
“I can’t ever remembered being 
snowed out, ” Wydra said, who is in his 30th season with the Tritons. “I’m not a real big fan of snow. ”
The Tritons were caught unprepared 
for the bitter cold, and it showed in their scores. With temperatures dropping into the mid-30s and only wind gear available, players struggled to find their rhythm while keeping warm.
“We were befuddled by the con-
ditions, ” Wydra said. “[The cold] was unbearable during the first round, and uncomfortable during the second. We’re not used to playing in that kind of cold. I was still shivering even with all the lay-ers that I could get on. ”
Okasaki said it was difficult to prac-
tice in warm weather, only to face bliz-zard-like conditions during the actual event. 
“It was 72 degrees during the practice 
round, ” he said. “It dropped to the mid-40s on Monday, then all the way to the 30s on Tuesday. It’s frustrating when you travel to these events only to have them cut short by weather. ”
After taking second place at the same 
event last season, Okasaki said he had hoped to perform better. Despite going two-under for the final seven holes, he fought the rhythm of his swing dur-ing both Monday rounds. In what has turned into a season-long problem, Okasaki blamed poor ball striking and a :6-;)(33
WOMEN DOMINATE THE DIAMOND

The Triton softball team came into last weekend’s series against Cal State East Bay from Feb. 19 to Feb. 20 with 
little awareness of the threat the opposition would pose. Thanks to some improved defense and solid pitching and hitting, it didn’t matter. 
The Tritons tacked on three wins in 
their four-game series against the Pioneers, a team new to the California Collegiate Athletic Association this season, and which the Tritons haven’t played since 1992. The wins put UCSD at 5-3 in the CCAA and 7-5 overall. 
“The players are getting to know their 
range through better communication, ” head coach Patti Gerckens said. “They are getting stronger as a team progressively, which is very satisfying. ” Overcoming a lack of experience with 
the Pioneers’ pitching and hitting abilities, UCSD went in strong from the start and easily won the first two games in the doubleheader on Feb. 19, with no errors on the board. 
“East Bay being a brand new team, it was 
a challenge, ” Gerckens said. “But we learned as it came. ”
In the first game, the Tritons charged 
ahead in the second inning with junior outfielder Rhiannon Ousley and junior infielder Jennifer De Fazio, sending two players home for a 2-0 lead. Later in the inning, junior outfielder Katrin Gabriel’s single to the pitcher brought in two runs by Ousley and sophomore outfielder Kellin Haley, boosting UCSD to a robust 4-0 lead. 
The Tritons were consistent in putting players on base, bringing in five more runs over the course of the game for a grand total of nine. Haley and De Fazio went two for two, each batting in a run.
The game ended in the fifth inning with 
the Pioneers unable to make a comeback, thanks to strong Triton defense on both the infield and outfield. 
UCSD defense stood strong in the second 
game: Senior pitcher Christine Zankich held the Pioneers back for three innings, and the rest of the team provided run support, knocking one in during the fourth inning for a 1-0 lead.
Gerckens said she had a specific strategy 
for pitching against the Pioneers: She asked Triton pitchers to pitch outside the strike

BASEBALL — The No. 3 nationally ranked 
UCSD men’s baseball team suffered a heartbreaking series opener when it hosted No. 23 Chico State at Triton Ballpark from Feb. 19 through Feb. 21. 
The Tritons opened CCAA play by 
carrying a 6-3 lead into the final frame, but the Triton wheels came off and the Wildcats came back for a 10-9 win against the UCSD bullpen.
Junior right-hander Tim Shibuya turned 
in a solid effort for UCSD, allowing four 
earned runs and striking out an impressive 
nine Wildcat hitters over 8.1 innings.
Despite carrying a lead into the ninth 
inning, a three-run home run dagger gave Chico an 8-6 lead which the team then built on with seven more ninth-inning runs for a 10-6 victory.
A three-run shot off the bat of junior 
outfielder Kyle Saul gave the Tritons one last gasp of breath in the bottom of the 
ninth, but they ended up falling one run 
short at 9-10.
Saul finished the game one single short 
of the cycle, going 3-5 with four RBIs.
“ O n e  a d j u s t m e n t  w e  n e e d  t o  m a k e  a s  a team is to make sure that we dictate the tempo of the game and take our game to the other team, ” Saul said. “ As an offense, w e  n e e d  t o  m a k e  s u r e  t h a t  w e  k e e p  o u r  approach at the plate for the entire game. ”
The second game of the doubleheader 
— postponed to Saturday due to weather — ended in another win for Chico, who outlasted the Tritons through 11 innings to notch a 9-6 victory.
Senior catcher Kellen Lee’s cycle from 
the plate provided one of the few bright spots in the game for the Tritons in the extra inning battle, but wasn’t enough to defeat the Wildcats, who scored three runs in the 11th inning.
“One thing we did not do well was take 
advantage of our opportunities we had on 
offense with runners [in] scoring position, ” 
Lee said. “Chico did come through in those situations. We just left too many people on base. ”
The Tritons were eager to at least split 
the series with Chico, and dug deep in the final two games of the series, thanks to a series of strong pitching performances.
Immediately after the rescheduled 
game, the Tritons played another nine 
innings with more favorable results.
Senior right-hander Matt Rossman tossed a complete game for the 4-3 win.
Rossman got off to a slow start in 
the third game, giving up back-to-back 
doubles that led to two first-inning runs.
However after giving up three runs on 
six hits in the first two innings, Rossman settled down to shut the Wildcats out for the final seven innings, en route to a complete game victory.
The Tritons took the lead in the fifth 
inning when senior outfielder Robert 
Sedin doubled, and fellow senior shortstop 
Vance Albitz followed with a single.
Junior third-baseman Evan Kehoe then 
hit a sacrifice fly, giving the Tritons a 4-3 lead.
Rossman struck out five and walked 
just two in the 4-3 victory, improving his record to 2-0 and pitching his first complete game of the season.
UCSD salvaged the series split by 
winning the fourth game 8-7 on Sunday.
After the Wildcats came out with a 
four-run lead in the second, hopes of a series split looked unlikely for the Tritons — but three runs in the third and three more in the fifth gave UCSD a 6-4 lead.
