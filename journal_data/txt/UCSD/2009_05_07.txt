Outgoing A.S. Council 
reconsiders, rejects motion to shut down indebted cafe.
By Reza Farazmand
News Editor
After weeks of intense delibera-
tion that consumed two A.S. Council meetings and drew 
impassioned response from dozens of concerned students, the drawn-out Grove Caffe debate came to an end last night after the council voted to keep the eatery’s doors open indefinitely. 
At the 2008-09 council’s final meet-
ing, cafe advocates and opponents argued over the Grove’s role as a stu-dent enterprise, the value of its 24-year history on campus and the risks associ-ated with allowing the cafe to remain open into next year. 
Currently over $120,000 in debt, the 
Grove has been a point of contention among councilmembers since becom-ing a fully student-owned enterprise in 2007. 
Following nearly three hours of 
discussion, the council voted nine in favor and 12 against a piece of legisla-=+<]Q\QWV0QSM8ZW\M[\

Students will be able to pro-
test the proposed UC education and registration fee increases over the phone today, directly before the UC Board of Regents meet via tele-conference. The regents
canceled a 
visit to UCSD to avoid distracting campus officials from fighting the swine-flu virus outbreak. 
The 20-minute student and 
public comment period will occur at 9:30 a.m. today in Price Center Ballroom B.
Student opposition to the sys-
temwide $626-per-quarter increase in systemwide educational fees and $36 increase in registration fees is largely based on concerns that the university has not created a long-term policy for regulating student fees. 
UC Students Association 
President Lucero Chavez, a UC Berkeley graduate student, said stu-dents need to know that fees won’t rise again when making plans for the future. 
Associated Students Vice 
President of External Affairs Lisa Chen said she was disappointed by the regents’ decision to cancel their campus meeting.
“It has completely changed our 
plans, ” Chen said. “We’ve been mobilizing students for this meet-ing and now they’re taking student speakers for only 20 minutes. ”
The scratched two-day meeting 
budgeted time for several rounds of students and workers to address the regents.
Student fees have increased by 
107 percent
over the last seven 
years. 
Campus Organizing Director for 
A.S. External Affairs Gracelynne West argued that middle-class stu-dents who do not receive financial aid will be the hardest hit, because — as fees continue to increase —they won’t have anything to protect them.
“We are addressing and exposing 
the lies of the regents, ” West said. “It is definitely a problem affect-ing low-income and middle-class UC students. For those that don’t receive financial aid, it’s a burden. It’s becoming harder for students to pay for school. ”
Speaking on behalf of A.S. 
External Affairs, West said the fee increase is merely a stopgap in response to California’s dire eco-nomic situation. 
“[The regents] continue to 
increase their fees as the number-one solution whenever there is a need for more revenue for the UC system, ” she said.
The Blue and Gold Opportunity 
Plan — which will provide qualified UC undergraduates with enough scholarship and grant assistance to cover their systemwide fees for the

The $53 million Conrad Prebys 
Music Center opens to the public this weekend with a series of pieces that will showcase its state-of-the-art per-formance space. Music department chairman Rand Steiger called the hall 
an architectural and acoustic “miracle. ”
The 400-seat concert hall was 
designed by Mark Reddington of  LMN 
Architects in collaboration with leg-endary acoustician Cyril Harris, whose resume includes the John F. Kennedy Center for the Arts in Washington, D.C., and the Metropolitan Opera House in New Y ork City.
The hall’s asymmetrical, triangular 
interior immediately sets it apart from conventional performance spaces. In fact, Steiger said the end result exceed-ed even the designers’ expectations.
“I think it’s probably the best work 
that they’ve done, and it reflects the spirit of and respect for innovation that we have in the department, ” he said. “In most concert halls, you either have a very clear sound that’s dry, or a really reverberant sound that isn’t so clear. But when you get it just right, you get that clarity of the initial impulse and then you get this beautiful bloom of sound around it. ”
UCSD principal architect Michael 
Downs, who oversaw the project, said the music center was a challenge to pull off because every wall, ceiling and floor had to suit a specific acoustic need. The exterior of the concert hall, 
for example, includes 12 to 18 inches 
of concrete to act as a shield against the noise of passing planes and buses.“Basically, it’s a building within a 
building, ” Downs said.
Designed specifically for chamber 
and experimental music, the hall does not accommodate a full symphony. However, piano performance gradu-ate student William Fried — one of the first musicians to play inside — said the hall’s small, wrap-around stage creates an intimate and comfortable 
environment for both performers and 
audience members.
He added that recordings of live 
performances in the new space will sound much better than in Mandeville Auditorium — built in 1975 — where 
After 34 years in 
Mandeville, the music dept. moves to a modernacoustic landmark.

Despite the plan’s promises, 
however, Chavez said she remains dissatisfied with the fine print.
“The university is not paint-
ing the bigger picture, because the [financial aid] money is only seen for the upcoming year, ” Chavez said. “Students won’t feel problems because of the Blue and Gold plan next year, but the money is only short term and not guaranteed. ”
Chen, who also serves as a mem-
ber of UCSA, said the regents have failed to take into consideration what impact the fees will have on students.
“It’s easy for us to be known as a 
budget item during these meetings, but by putting personal stories to the fee increases, we show that we’re not a statistic, ” she said.

operations beginning June 30. 
Grove student manager Thomas 
Frank, who attended last night’s meet-ing to offer his input, said he looks for-ward to working closely with the new council — which will enter office next week — on maintaining a profitable business model for the cafe.
“One advantage to this long, drawn-
out process is that now I know people on A.S., ” Frank said. “Now I know how to contact people … now I can show up whenever I want and propose ideas about the Grove for them to discuss. ” 
Throughout last night’s discus-
sion, councilmembers referenced the Grove’s performance over the last year as an indicator of its future sustainabil-ity. The cafe’s combined losses of over $35,000 since July drew vocal criticism from many who feared that profits would continue to dip. 
Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garrett Berg proposed an amendment to the legislation call-ing for a reworking of the Grove’s business model, saying the cafe would continue to fail if its current model is sustained.
“I think it’s going to take a really long time to come up with a solid plan that doesn’t mirror everything we’ve tried in the past, ” Berg said.
However, Frank and Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Naasir Lakhani pointed to the Grove’s recent profit of over $1,000 for the month of April, asserting that the cafe’s current business model is sustainable. Lakhani also said the Grove will see increased profits once nonstudent manager Cleveland Thomas leaves the cafe in June, eliminating the position’s $50,000 annual salary.
“We would’ve made $12,000 this 
year without the salaried manager, ” Lakhani said.
Incoming A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta, who opposed the legislation to cease Grove operations, said he will work with the cafe’s managers to devise a new business model and ensure that the eatery develops a customer base. 
“ I  h a v e  t o  m a k e  s u r e  t h a t  w e  d o  
make the Grove profitable, that we do make the Grove a more active place, ” he said. “Part of that is going to be using a new business model, using a student-run business model to reduce costs, but that’s not enough. It needs advertising initiatives, it needs to get out there, and tha t ’ s going to be an effort of both the A.S. Council and the Grove. ”

Last night was a  long emotional 
rollercoaster, as it was the last meeting of the year for the 
2008-09 A.S. Council.
The council passed resolutions 
in support of implementing “a-g” requirements in all high schools in San Diego County, creating a graffiti landmark on campus and upholding corporate social responsibility.
Following the approval of the reso-
lutions, councilmembers, Grove Caffe student manager Thomas Frank  and 
2006 Revelle College alumnus Rachel 
Corell  debated for 
nearly three hours over whether or not to cease operation of the struggling eatery. The council voted to keep the cafe open.
South Asian student organization 
Sangam put in a last-minute funding request for their culture show, which is set to take place this Saturday at the Copley Symphony Hall in downtown San Diego. The item was allowed into the new business section, and Sangam was heavily criticized for asking for additional funding for the tradition event for yet another year.
“I would have been fine with this 
three weeks ago. I just think that this is really irresponsible, ” Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Lana 
Blank  said. “They asked for $3,000, 
we decided to give them $5,000, I don’t even know how finance came to that conclusion. ”
Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garrett Berg  sheep-
ishly admitted that he had motioned to fund $5,000 based off of the orga-nization’s request for $10,000, not realizing that $3,000 was the actual requested amount. 
Revelle College Senator Katie Hall  successfully motioned to amend the amount awarded to be $3,000, and the council approved the funding request despite the immense level of dissatis-faction with the organization.
All-Campus Senator Chris 
Westling’s proposal to have the council scrutinize the updated campus speech policy was not allowed into new busi-ness, and will subsequently be one of the many happy tasks for the new council to square away in the follow-ing weeks.
Many councilmembers waxed 
sentimental over the experiences of working with one another dur-ing open forum, including Sixth College Senator John Cressey , 
who said with feeling, “I’ll carry A.S. in my heart forever. ”
Berg  informed the council about 
the A.S. Sun God store, which occu-pies the former STA Travel space next to the box office. He begged councilmembers to help out at the Sun God festival, promising volun-teers one-of-a-kind staff T-shirts and unlimited in-and-out privileges in the festival area.
Blank congratulated the council 
for passing the most resolutions and featuring the most intense public inputs she has ever witnessed. She ended her mini-speech by leading a vigorous applause around the forum for President Donna Bean .
Bean gave a few words of wisdom 
to incoming President-elect Utsav 
Gupta  before giving a few thanks of 
her own.
“We got really lucky with the peo-
ple we’ve worked with, ” Bean said. “I’m just extremely proud of everyone for being extremely invested. I hope I see you again, just not here. ”

have left him frustrated.
“If you have to send out a live 
recording of your playing, you want it to be the best quality possible, ” he said.
Located at the corner of Gilman 
Drive and Russell Lane in Sixth College, the three-story, 46,880-square-foot building also houses six digital record-ing studios, a recording booth with live-streaming capabilities, computer labs and rehearsal rooms, one large enough to accommodate the La Jolla Symphony and Chorus.
Many of these spaces are extremely 
versatile, Steiger said. After receiving a flood of faculty input, his planning committee brainstormed ways to con-solidate room functions in order to stay below the square-footage cap. 
The most obvious example is the 
second floor’s 150-seat Experimental Theater, which is loaded with $150,000 in microphones and speakers, creat-ing a virtual acoustic system that can be adjusted with the push of a but-ton. This technology allows the room to serve as a lecture hall, as well as a performance space for a range of ensembles and soloists. 
In addition, faculty members spe-
cializing in computer music will use the space as an ongoing research project, 
exploring the capabilities of the system and collaborating with its creators at Berkeley’s Meyer Sound to improve it.
Steiger said that building a world 
landmark for musical exploration comes with an obligation to share it.
“ A lot of people are going to want to 
put more of their creative energy here because it’s such a privileged place to work in, ” he said. “From the point of view of our relationship to the city, the campus and the larger musical commu-nity, it’s a really important moment for us. It’s up to us now not to fumble that. ”

Last year, Bernal — in collabora-
tion with student regent Ben Allen, 
then regent-designate D’ Artagnan Scorza and the UCSA executive board — was active in lowering a proposed fee increase from 10 percent at $663 per student to 7 percent at $464 per student. This lower fee increase, Bernal said,  reflects the best the UC system 
could do during the financial crisis.
“I think that the unfortunate thing 
I realized [working on the fees] ... is that our colleagues on the board are saying that these are as close to zero as we would like to see them, ” Bernal said.
Bernal said he recognizes the 
impact the national economic crisis has had on students from lower- and middle-class incomes, but that he sees hope in programs such as the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan that provide assistance for students whose family income level falls below $60,000.
“I think the sticker price and the 
sticker shock issue is very relevant, ” Bernal said. “The other side of the coin is that the university does pretty well to support these lower-income students. ”
Bernal said one of the reasons he 
was interested in becoming a student regent is that LGBT issues have been absent from all nine of the university’s annual reports on staff diversity[??].
“I’ve been fortunate enough to 
be able to already start working with some of the UC LGBT center direc-tors on gaining a better understand-ing of the campus climate in terms of LGBT diversity, ” Bernal said. “I think it’s important for the [regents] to gain some insight into [the issues concern-ing] our LGBT community and LGBT communities of color on campuses. ”
Bernal lobbied with graduate stu-

In a perfect, environmentally 
conscious world, we’ d all carry reusable dishware and bottles. In 
reality, we use products that come in disposable containers or require paper packaging. Producing waste seems like it’s out of our immediate control, but it’s not. We’ve heard about the three Rs — reduce, reuse, recycle — so much that they trigger eye-rolls quicker than you can say “landfill, ” but the slogan prioritizes environmental action.
By reducing, we should evaluate our 
consumption and eliminate unneces-sary products and practices. If we don’t buy products in disposable packaging, companies won’t produce them. By reusing, we can maximize our available materials’ use. This means investing in a sturdy water bottle rather than buying a new bottle each day. And finally — as a last resort — we should recycle unnecessary resources when they become absolutely useless. 
Our third and most hyped R is the 
most controversial: Many argue recy-cling actually wastes more energy than throwing trash into a landfill.
True, recycling isn’t a flawless pro-
cess. Recycling facilities rely on local power grids, which depend on coal-fired plants. On the other side of the coin, virgin paper mills typically use less fossil fuel to operate than waste-paper facilities. This is because the machines used to make new paper are usually powered by timber detri-tus — a waste product from the wood pulping process. In terms of carbon-dioxide emissions, coal is generally dirtier than wood. The Environmental Defense Fund argues that recycling paper cuts overall greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the amount of waste diverted to landfills (where decomposition leads to the production of methane, a more potent greenhouse gas) and by not cultivating new forest lands, though research is still sketchy in this area.
Critics argue that the fossil fuels 
used to run collection trucks offset the environmental merits of recycling. But according to a study by Washington-based environmental consultant Jeffrey Morris, 10.4 million British thermal units are used to manufacture prod-ucts from a ton of recyclables. A total of 0.9 Btu are used to collect, haul and process recyclables (much less than the 23.3 million Btu required for making virgin materials). So even from an energy standpoint, it makes perfect sense to recycle. 
Through recycling, we can save 
energy because we have the technol-ogy to make the same products at a fraction of the cost of mining and 
extracting natural resources to make 
new products.
If you want to break it down to 
specific materials, Morris found that aluminum requires 96 percent less energy if made from recycled cans than bauxite (the mineral ore from which virgin, or new, aluminum is harvested). Recycled plastic bottles use 76 percent less energy; newsprint uses 
about 45 percent less. Recycled glass 
comes in at the lowest, saving us about EDITORIALS

Riddle me this.
Y ou’re a UC regent, and 
you’re scheduled to vote on 
whether to increase student fees by $662 per quarter next week. Y ou’re slated to make this decision at a public meeting held at UCSD, where you expect to encounter stu-dents who have seen fees continu-ally rise since they were freshmen. Simultaneously, a mild form of the flu breaks out in San Diego, elicit-ing panic throughout much of the community. 
What do you do?If you were anything like the real 
regents, you’ d release a statement in which you discreetly cancel your visit and use swine flu as a cop-out. 
In complete disregard for the 
students who have been looking forward to their visit for months, the university’s higher-ups did just that last Friday afternoon. 
Today, instead of facing a long 
line of cash-strapped students demanding a more affordable edu-cation, the UC Board of Regents will be voting on a potential $1,986 student-fee increase for the 2009-10 academic year — over the phone.
It’s doubtful the regents canceled 
their campus visit because they were genuinely worried they would “divert the attention or resourc-es” our campus needs to combat the hardly lethal swine flu. There have been no recorded cases of the disease at UCSD, which  — reas-sured by Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s incessant e-mails — means we don’t really have anything to worry about. Even if, say, 2,000 Tritons contracted the disease overnight, those responsible for orchestrating the meeting wouldn’t be tasked with tending to runny-nosed students. 
The UC regents were well aware 
they were going vote to raise student fees today, like they do almost every year, and used the pandemic as a scapepig.
Because more important than a 
disease-free meeting is one without mobs of angry students and negative media attention. By voting via tele-conference, the regents are ducking unpleasant obstacles in the way of raising student fees during a diffi-cult recession.
Perhaps even more cowardly, the 
board scheduled the conference one week after the deadline for admits to submit their intent to register. 
It’s nothing more than a vicious corporate tactic, considering an extra $1,986 in student fees is enough for any middle-class family to choose community college or a less expen-sive California State University cam-pus over a UC campus. 
The board, in essence, got exactly 
what it wanted: Incoming students chose their preferred campus without all the financial facts, and a stu-dent-organized rally against this fee increase meeting — scheduled to take place at UCSD — was canceled. 
It’s common courtesy to let  
prospective students know exactly how much they’re expected to pay for their education, and existing students should be offered more than a 20-minute over-the-phone courtesy Q-and-A when a 10 per-cent fee increase is at stake. Until the regents start showing us some respect, we can only expect these strategic moves to become semi-permanent side acts to their annual fee-hike routine.
The regents have proven to 
be masterminds at finding ways to avoid the public hot seat and ignore students; it’s about time they channel that energy into creating a more sustainable financial plan for the UC system. Maybe a genu-ine conversation between students and regents might result in a little less fee increasing and a little more progress.
But if they refuse to give us 
anything more than 20 minutes of phone time, they should at least have the decency to tell us they don’t care in person.

In its final meeting, and after months of consideration, the 2008-09 A.S. Council voted not 
to cease operations of the ailing Grove Caffe. The decision, which some councilmembers are liberally calling the enterprise’s last chance, marks a renewed attention to enter-prises that incoming President Utsav Gupta and incoming Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch hope to foster next year.
Now the new council finds itself 
trudging into office with the cafe’s future largely unresolved. But unlike transitions past, councilmembers must make sure that Grove oversight doesn’t get lost in the shuffle. This means prioritizing the enterprise office, and council-cafe relations.
The current Grove Advisory 
Committee is a joke at best, with the deeply indebted cafe as its punch-line. Forming a serious group of councilmembers, Grove employees and financial advisors is a crucial first step that must be handled immediately. 
Benesch and Gupta should 
approach the appointment of asso-
ciate vice president of enterprise 
operations with a higher standard for the position, and demand a pro-activity and accountability that was absent from Chelsea Maxwell’s two-year tenure. 
Once appointments are final-
ized in two weeks, these committee meetings must start immediately. It almost goes without saying, but 
obviously the meetings should be 
mandatory, weekly and provide detailed progress reports to the A.S. Council every Wednesday. And not just during the transition period — this committee and the enterprise office play a vital role in any future Grove success. 
Every councilmember should be 
personally invested in the Grove’s success, rather than passing the buck as we’ve seen council after council do. This means taking initiative to stay on top of the cafe’s business decisions and finances — without depending on vague, slanted infor-mation or anecdotal interactions. 
To pull their enterprise out of debt 
councilmembers must get down to the nitty-gritty. 
Some of the Grove’s most out-
spoken council supporters were also involved with the 2007 decision, but they find their favored coffee shop in even more dire straits just two years later because they failed to address any of its problems.
Councilmembers should be 
involved in every aspect of the Grove’s operations. While revamp-ing the business plan to make it profitable is an imperative first step, the council must also support the enterprise’s advertising and pro-gramming efforts (because hiring the Deejay and Vinylphiles Club to drown out KSDT radio for a few hours creates a racket more likely to make students flee the area than visit it).
Last night’s discussion was noth-
ing new: Grove employees provided no new insight, councilmembers added no new ideas to this years-
long debate and the nearly three-
hour conversation yielded no new (or solid) plans. Even this board’s recommendations contain nothing new; for years the Guardian  has 
rallied and pleaded for increased council oversight.
But the incoming council — with 
a horde of members committed spe-cifically to cleaning up the finance and enterprise offices, led by Grove enthusiasts Gupta and Benesch — is new. And this new group should prepare its momentum for a massive overhaul.

Plastics are made from crude oil, 
glass from sand and silica, aluminum 
from bauxite and paper from trees. By recycling, we reduce the need to use oil, cut down trees and mine for met-als. By trashing everything, we spend more money and energy to mine and extract new resources, while recycla-bles just hang out in landfills for the next several hundred years waiting to decompose instead of being reincar-nated into your next shirt (yes, some bottles are recycled into polyester).
Miramar Landfill on Convoy Street 
estimates that about 1.4 million tons of San Diego’s trash goes to its site every year. Because of recycling and other diversion techniques, the amount has decreased by 400,000 tons from an average of 1.8 million tons in 1988. According to the Disposal Division of the Environmental Services Department, current estimates antici-pate that the Miramar Landfill will reach capacity sometime around 2012. Who knows where we’ll put our trash then. But because over 60 percent of our trash is recyclable, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, we have the power to postpone that disaster.
Recycling is a good alternative for 
maximizing our resources and pre-venting waste, but it’s not the magical solution. We can’t just nonchalantly use tons of bottles, cans and paper, thinking that recycling is magically going to solve environmental issues. 
Everything is part of a balance, 
and our actions directly tip the scales. If we’re going to continue bottling beverages and packaging products, recycling is as close to a win-win solu-tion we can have for those materials. Throwing recyclables away is what it is: a waste. I know I can’t reach into every single trash can and take out the recyclables. If you do recycle, keep up the effort — your actions will affect future generations’ mindsets. Influence others through your actions and awareness will spread.A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro
Dear Editor,
In the April 20 article, “This 
Time It’s Serious. No, Really. ” about the Grove Caffe, Hadley Mendoza wrote: “Students can only hope that this year’s council really has the institutional memory it brags about. ” 
Let’s be honest, neither the A.S. 
Council nor the Guardian  has insti-
tutional memory. Neither source has past minutes or articles easily avail-able and searchable online, and both organizations’ members are always changing yearly or even monthly, so memory relies on those who choose to save information themselves or keep their synapses intact.
Let’s look at institutional memo-
ry — back to the Grove’s glory days when lines were long and food was great. Before the A.S. commissioner of services and enterprises — it used to be one combined office — couldn’t figure out if it was “Caffe” or “Cafe. ” 
The Grove used to be owned and 
operated with love by Ron Carlson, until the council decided to try to fully own an enterprise it couldn’t and didn’t want to handle. 
The A.S. Council has a history of 
horrible business management and financial decisions — often dipping into its mandate reserves fund to bail itself out of another debacle. 
Even the administration doesn’t 
trust the A.S. Council to own any-thing, as evidenced by our complete lack of control and ownership over the Price Center and Student Center expansions and the SRTV shutdown of 2005.
Councilmembers can whine 
about what happened to the Grove, but it is their own fault. They chose to buy it out from the previous owner; they chose to not promote it. The Grove isn’t even listed on the A.S. Web site as an enterprise. They chose to hire inept people to run it, and now they are choosing to let it die. How many councilmembers have ever even eaten there? 
Go back to when the Grove had 
delicious and fresh brie sandwiches instead of prepackaged junk. Back to when the coffee was great and people hung out to play bongos, study and chat. Even back to the recent fight to get meal points there in 2005, which was almost imme-diately forgotten. Even the current “Save the Grove Caffe” fight rests on bad coffee and spelling mis-takes.
I’m all in favor of saving the 
Grove and not letting it die into a new office space, but it will require the tremendous effort of people who both care and have good business sense. I don’t think the current A.S. Council has either. Its best bet is to give the Grove to someone who does, like its thrown-away idea of the Rady School or a business-savvy alum. 
My institutional memory hopes 
the Grove stays alive.

the charts. Now, Sixth College’s Kuncocshun Festival is stepping in line, skipping over a tradition of mellow rock acts to hire its Grammy-nominated headliner — and after that A.S. mandate-reserve funding fiasco, Shiny Toy Guns better be damn good.
On the outside, the Los Angeles band is weird enough. 
Goth “Matrix” attire (S&M straps and plenty of guyliner to go around), Chad Petree’s emo swoon and Sisley Treasure’s grrly thrash are paraded atop Jeremy Dawson’s insane carnival keys. (Guessing we’re not in Kansas anymore, people.) 
Both the Guns’ singles interchange pure party synths 
(“Ricochet!”) with makeout-ready melodies (“Le Disko”). On stage, Treasure screams and scrapes with all the breath in her smoked-out lungs; Petree whispers slow and soft, tearing into jagged heartbreak even as he attempts a traditional rock ballad.Judging from all 
this — and from the superglam “Le Disko” video that transforms a stripper into a tarantula — it’s h a r d  t o  k n o w  w h a t  t o  e x p e c t .  After a lifetime of Britneys and Dashboards headlining the festivi-ties, it’s a little strange to hear an up-and-coming band so openly goth and so willing to sell out (watch for the 2010 Lincoln MKZ). Just hope that Shiny Toy Guns shock the stage with (at least) their glittery master-slave outfits — and that the act lives up to the pose.

Versatility’s a good thing for pocket knives, thespians, power tools and music — but only if you can find a use for all the parts. Otherwise, you end up 
with gumbo: six musicians jumping from funk to moralizing rap, transitioning from English into Spanish with too many instruments competing for the stage to make anything tangible (not to mention danceable). 
Although these California kids’ flows are 
sturdy, they’re not quite substantial enough to carry the latitude of an ensemble playing (count ’ em) four different instruments apiece. And with a low-key Kenny G vibe (for the most part), we’re too busy napping to notice that the Elevaters are blessed with a tolerable dose of talent. Maybe it’s supposed  to sound like eleva-
tor music on E?

ringlets with so much passion that all the bats nesting there 
squawk into the night, biologically unable to tolerate vibrations 
like “Y ou’ve got your lights on/ But you don’t see me” escaping 
from toothless yawn of lead singer. (Complete with supplementary 
ooh-oohs “Y ou don’t” and “See me” from two off-key Harrisons on 
guitars.) In the “crowd, ” three short pre-meds with matching pea 
coats headbang their (also matching) haircuts shyly. “Hey, that’s my 
MMW T.A., ” one dude says, standing awkwardly in his Revelle orienta-
tion T-shirt and Elvis Costello glasses. MMW shout-out match ensues. 
Lead singer plays a number called “Pillanoid, ” then announces there’s 
still time for three more songs.
 So, yeah — you wouldn’t want to miss the sequel.

Heaven and Hell
■ The Devil You Know
RHINO
Hide the women and children — Black Sabbath’s back.
They might call themselves Heaven and Hell now, 
but don’t be fooled by the moniker change: This is 
Ronny James Dio-era Sabbath. The Devil You Know is 
a thunderous comeback, descending (as only Sabbath 
could) into menacing riffs and consuming visions of hellfire.
Guitars set a sinister pulse for Vinny Appice’s raw, 
spine-tingling drums to herald “ Atom and Evil. ” These are your final rites, and Dio’s condemning tenor bids absolute surrender: “Expand your mind, we’ve got a place for you/ Just make believe that one and one are always two. ” 
Just when “The Bible Black” enthralls with an inno-
cent, wistful intro worthy of “Stairway to Heaven, ” the facade is torn away, revealing the red-hot obsession boil-ing beneath. Dio’s clarion snarl (think angry Gregorian monk) frames the album’s fall from grace, drawing an epic centerpiece of crosses and bones. 
From there, Heaven and Hell basks in its own shadow. 
“Eating the Cannibals” is a Harley of a track, its engine ripping with a flurry of bass pedal to an 80-mph, traffic-swerving solo from (probable AARP qualifier) Tommy Iommi.
Though a few tracks aren’t as sinister with the volume 
cranked low, it’s the album’s only major sin. Between “Cannibals” and “The Bible Black, ” Devil bloodies our 
gums, with fresh material for new and old fans alike. It’s their masochistic power to peel back the skin that counts, fueling what will surely be one of this year’s big-gest metal releases. So do yourself a favor and drown yourself in the distortion.

ABRAMS SCORES LONG-AWAITED 
VICTORY FOR NEXT-GEN TREKKIES
By David Harvey
Senior Staff Writer
J.J. Abrams has come a long way from the dreadful finale of “ Alias. ” (Nevermind
 that the show was well 
received among both closeted and not-so-closeted sci-fi fanatics.) Since
 land-
ing the limelight with “Lost, ” Abrams — today’s George Lucas  — revives an artifact worthy of an Indiana Jones crusade. That’s right — “Star Trek” delivers. 
Fans of the 
original series were apprehen-sive, to say the least; so many critics were touting the failures of odd-numbered “Trek” films that the latest remake seemed cursed from the beginning. 
Surprisingly, though, one of the 
film’s only pitfalls is its pandering to tradition. Name-dropping feels forced, catchphrases like “Damn it Spock, I’m a doctor, not a physi-cist!” were thrown in like obligatory afterthoughts and the token random red-shirt guy was doomed to die the moment he left the ship. 
But, with a time-travel-induced 
alternate universe caused by space vil-lain Nero — played by Eric Bana, with the same subtlety he brought to the Australian hit “Chopper” — Abrams takes his “Trek” where no “Trek” has gone before. A hefty feat, considering the countless television spinoffs and 10 filmic remakes. 
Center stage in the prequel are the 
young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine, as convincing as in his neo-Nazi assassin role in “Smoking Aces”) and Spock (Zachary Quinto, with all the pas-
sion that keeps “Heroes” heart-throttling). 
But unlike 
in “Wolverine, ” the other early summer block-buster, the sup-porting crew of  
characters — Dr. McCoy, Uhura and even helmsman Chekov — are quite well developed. The film also doesn’t get soaked in the lousy love-story drama of “Trek” head writer Roberto Orci, who brought us both the stale “Mission: Impossible III” and sloppy “Transformers. ” Don’t get too excited, though — Orci’s romantic ineptitude creeps into

The charm of this “Trek” prequel 
can be its breaks from the original (please forgive me, devout Trekkies), which kick-start an aged genre. It might not be a tried-and-true remake of a classic, but it’s damn good sum-mer fare.*6<9;,:@6-:7@.3(::,5;,9;(054,5;

Rated RBen Folds
■ Ben Folds Presents: University A Capella!
EPIC
Like Ben Folds as much as he likes himself?
If so, go snatch University A Capella! , the forty-some-
thing’s sweetest pop pitch yet. And it’s made by kids just 
like you: The former Billboarder enlisted a hodgepodge of collegiate a capella groups to revamp his resume. 
What a surprise, then, that the lowly amateurs one-up 
the pro. This is a movie we’ve all seen before — students surpass teacher’s expectations, and how! 
Folds’ thinly veiled scramble for street cred is a sadder 
story every repeat. Too bad: As one-third of the super-cute Ben club (along with Kweller and Lee), he could have had it in the bag.
Covers are hard for anyone to pull off, much less covers 
by a bunch of star-struck talents looking for their big break. Folds scrutinized hundreds of entries trying to capture America’s youthful “magic” and release it to the public for a nominal fee. Spotlighting the nation’s newest vocal talents might be the best part of this equation, though, because most of the lead singers can belt Folds’ songs better than he can — even with Peter Pan-isms like “Everybody knows it sucks to grow up. ” Biggest props to the University of Georgia, whose choir covers “Y ou Don’t Know Me” with all of Regina Spektor’s ornamental whimsy. 
“Boxing” yanks a lone soprano out of obscurity and 
sets her a-wailing over Folds’ boy-next-door croon; her Broadway trills ice his clunky vocals with stale-enough frost-ing. He responds like a man: “Sometimes I punch myself hard as I can. ” (Go on, do it.)
Just wondering — where exactly are the UCSD Tritones? 
Step it up! Maybe you’ll make Ben Folds’ newest Greatest Hits album if you can harmonize “Effington” with the best of ’ em.
Ben Folds will perform live in San Diego at the House of 
Blues on May 21 — sans a capella amateurs.

WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORGPASTEL YOGA DOC WAXES ‘REAL WORLD: INDIA’
By Michael Tang
Staff Writer
Eighteen million Americans prac-
tice a Baskin-Robbins variety of yoga, ” director Kate Churchill 
said [in an interview]. “It’s better than sex. ” 
To prove her point, the seven-
year practitioner enlists urbane New Y orker Nick Rosen — offspring of a lawyer and a shamanic healer — to undergo a social experiment that includes trotting the globe in search of yoga’s true meaning. 
Of course, the multibillion-dollar 
industry is also one that prides itself on doing exactly as what film’s title flagrantly suggests: achieving enlight-enment.
The mission takes Churchill and 
Rosen from isolated forest in Hawaii to the cow-infested roadside offices of master yogis in India. But per-haps their most poignant visit is with ex-pro-wrestler-turned-master-yogi Diamond Dallas Page, who captures America’s insatiable thirst for cultural fusion gone wrong. 
“Y oga is about T and A, ” roars Page 
as he performs a couple asanas on his prim lawn in West Hollywood, two scantily clad blondes contorting their bodies in the background. 
Unfortunately, Churchill’s brash 
and incorrigible commitment to describing yoga as nothing more than a high-brow workout — berating a laid-back Rosen in multiple interviews for not treating yoga as a tool of “trans-formation” — overwhelms what little objectivity the film rides on. 
As a result, “Up!” becomes less 
about yoga as an art form and more about the rather dysfunctional and hilarious relationship between Churchill and her subject. Eventually, Churchill’s curiosity sinks to disen-chantment, leaving Rosen with the troublesome burden of re-energizing an otherwise banal and cursory study of a two-millennia-old spiritual prac-tice.
“Up!” does do a good job of 
detouring from the Ken Burns factoid-based documentary — albeit largely by substituting fact with         drama. And creviced between clips of Rosen’s emo-tional breakdowns and Churchill’s frustration are pockets of wisdom in interviews with world-renowned gurus. 
The bubble-gum soundtrack and 
pastel palette of the film might accen-tuate Churchill’s spunk more than advance the storyline, but it’s at least a reminder to audiences that “Up!” is more a soccer-mom fix than a source of spiritual guidance.
Enlighten Up!

who has endured several defeats at 
the hands of Hawaii Pacific in her career, helped clinch the 5-4 win for UCSD by also coming back from a set down for a stirring 4-6, 6-1, 7-5 win at the No. 6 singles position.
“It was so rewarding to beat Hawaii 
Pacific during the regular season, but the stakes are raised now that the season has become a do-or-die situation, ” Tran said. “Entering this matchup, I feel our team has a much higher level of belief in each other, which gives us an advantage over the last meeting against the Sea Warriors. ”
On paper, this weekend’s match 
looks to be as exciting as the previous encounter, with the Sea Warriors on a roll, having won six of their last seven matches entering this showdown. Hawaii Pacific has beaten the Tritons three times over the past two years, and is looking to avenge its loss to UCSD from earlier in the season. The victory on March 2 was the first time the Tritons had beaten the Sea Warriors since the 2005-06 season. The Tritons aim to advance into the second round of the regionals for the fourth consecutive year, while the Sea Warriors hope to improve on their Sweet 16 appearance from last year. 
The winner of this matchup will 
move one step closer toward the NCAA Championships, which will take place in Altamonte Springs, Fla., from May 13 to May 16.
Readers can contact Neil Joshi at 
nejoshi@ucsd.edu.Negishi led a unit that battled 
adversity all season. His experience at the top of the lineup has helped a relatively young unit to an 8-3 record in its last 11 matches.
Hawaii Pacific owns a head-
to-head win over UCSD, a 7-2 triumph on March 1 that dropped the Tritons to 4-6 overall. In that match, freshman Jake Fellow was the only player to record a win in singles, earning a victory at the No. 3 spot. In doubles, Negishi teamed up with sophomore Erik Elliot to record UCSD’s only other point at No. 1 doubles. Hawaii Pacific has dominated its last seven matches with a 6-1 record, earning the region’s top seed.
As the team’s captain, Negishi 
knows UCSD can compete with the Sea Warriors despite the lopsided score that it lost by earlier in the season. However, he knows each individual will need to be better than they were on the first of March and play at the top of his game.
“Our doubles needs to step it up 
and play a really clean match, ” he said. “If they are able to establish that, we can have a sense of belief in our squad. We barely lost to them earlier in the year while missing two of our of starters, so as a team we know we can compete with them. ” 
Thursday’s game against the Sea 
Warriors is slated to begin at 2:30 p.m.

UCSD followed the victory over 
Humboldt State with a battle against Sonoma State, winning 3-2. The Tritons scored in the top of the first on an RBI double from junior catcher Nicole Saari. The Seawolves went on to even the score at one in their half of the first. UCSD then took the lead, making the game a 3-1 contest in the top of third, when May belted a two-run homer to left field. The Seawolves 
reduced the Triton lead to one run in the bottom of the fourth, but UCSD shut out Sonoma State for the rest of the game, with Gaito picking up her 11th win of the season.
“The team is playing very well right 
now and our bats are hot, ” Gerckens said.
With the two victories, UCSD 
advanced to the CCAA Tournament Championship title game and was set to play for the title in a rematch against rival Cal State Monterey Bay. However, the Tritons were unable to compete for the conference title as severe weather caused the game to be canceled. Shortened by rain, the tournament reverted to a single-elimination format and Cal State Monterey Bay was declared the 2009 CCAA Champions.
“Monterey got lucky last weekend 
with the rainout of the championship game. ” Lesovsky said. “We will take it to them this weekend at regionals. ”
UCSD will face Hawaii Pacific in 
the first round of the NCAA Division-II West Regional. The regional is a four-team  double elimination tournament. 
Hawaii Pacific enters the upcoming 
match against UCSD as the winner of nine straight games, including a victory over University of Hawaii-Hilo in the PacWest conference title game. The Sea Warriors were the victors in a 12-3 drubbing at the Tournament of Champions in Turlock, Calif. The winner of the UCSD-HPU game will take on the winner of No. 3 Dixie State and No. 6 Cal State Monterey Bay on Saturday, May 9.
“The team is ready and looking 
forward to playing Hawaii Pacific, ” Gerckens said. “If we just focus on our game, we will do well. ”
In the other West subregional, No. 
4 Cal State Stanislaus will take on No. 5 Montana State-Billings, and No. 1 Humboldt State will face No. 8 Sonoma State on Friday in Arcata, Calif.

WEEKEND PLAYOFF PREVIEW
By John Beck
Staff Writer
SOFTBALL —  Thanks to an outstanding 
performance in their conference tourna-ment, the Tritons have been granted the No. 7 seed in the NCAA Division-II West Regional. UCSD (29-23) will now battle No. 2 seed Hawaii Pacific University (35-9) on May 8 in St. George, Utah.
The Tritons earned a third consecutive 
NCAA appearance after winning two out of three games in the California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship Tournament April 30 and May 1 in Stockton, Calif. 
Third seeded  UCSD started the 
CCAA tournament on a sour note, falling to No. 2 seed Cal State Monterey Bay 7-3. In the double-elimination tournament, UCSD stayed alive by trouncing No. 1 Humboldt State University 8-0 and taking a close contest against No. 4 Sonoma State University 3-2.
Cal State Monterey Bay got off to a 
quick 2-0 lead against UCSD to open the game. With the Tritons trailing 3-1 through four innings, an RBI single from senior first baseman Jenni Habib brought home sophomore outfielder Kristyn Lesovsky and tied the game. Cal State Monterey Bay kept UCSD’s offense at bay for the remainder of the game, shutting out the Tritons while the Otters scored four runs in the fifth for the 7-3 victory.
Facing elimination against defending 
national champion Humboldt State, the Tritons stepped up their game, crushing the Warriors with 13 hits. Junior shortstop Amanda Eliades had two hits and drove in three runs in the win. Sophomore infielder Sarah Woofter and senior outfielder Allison May contributed two hits apiece in the victory. The Tritons’ domination led the game to be called after six innings of play via the mercy rule.
“Everyone came up clutch for us: 
hits, plays in the field, everything, ” Habib said. “I don’t think there was anything we failed to do as a whole. ”
Freshman pitcher Camille Gaito had 
another impressive performance. Gaito improved her record to 10-3, while giving up only three hits and striking out two Warriors.
“Camille was just brilliant today, ” head 
coach Patti Gerckens said. “She kept both

CREW — It was a day of firsts 
for the Tritons when they learned their varsity eight squad would be making a trip to the International Rowing Association National Championships, scheduled in June. Racing at the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships on May 2 and 3 in Sacramento, the Tritons garnered a multitude of solid finishes to continue their record-breaking season, ultimately placing third at the event.
The men’s varsity eight, second 
varsity eight, novice eight and novice lightweight four boats each competed in the Grand Finals during day two of the regatta on Sunday. In Saturday’s preliminary stages, the varsity eight boat foreshadowed its success, plac-ing first in the second heat with a time of 6:02.3. Moving on to compete in the Grand Finals, the Tritons faced an intense showdown against their rival Gonzaga University.
“Gonzaga is a great crew with a lot 
of talent and depth, ” senior co-captain Jon Lynch said before the race. “They know we are targeting them and we know they are targeting us. From the second the starter says, ‘row’ it is going to be a fight till the last stroke. ”
Lynch’s prediction turned out to 
be true as both boats were neck-and-neck around the 700-meter mark. The Bulldogs pushed forward to an advantage before the Tritons battled back and moved several seats into the lead with 500 meters left in the race. Unfortunately, Gonzaga was able to stretch ahead and slightly out of reach in the nick of time, crossing the finish line at 5:59.7. The Tritons finished with a time 6:00.3 to win a silver medal. 
The varsity eight lineup featured 
junior Andrew Hilton, senior co-captain Ryan Andre, junior Jay Dee Morgan, senior Jeff Collett, sopho-more Kris Grey, freshman Nathan Morgan, junior Karam Badran, soph-omore Justin Gordon and coxswain Cameran Bittucci
The second varsity eight also fared well, winning heat two in its division on the first day of competition. In the Grand Finals, Gonzaga again placed first, but UCSD’s finish of 6:26.9 was well ahead of third-place UC Davis’ time of 6:31.7. The men’s novice eight and novice lightweight four also put together strong performances despite the horrible weather. The novice eight finished fourth in its Grand Final with a time of 6:13.6, while the novice lightweight four recorded a fifth-place finish and time of 7:11.1. 
After the day’s success, the Tritons 
took home numerous honors. Andre, Collett and Badran were named to the All-WIRA first team, while Lynch was a second team honoree. Head coach Zach Johnson was named Coach of the Y ear. 
Women’s crew also performed well 
at the event, although rowers strug-gled with the challenge of competing in pounding rain. The varsity eight finished fourth in its petite final with a time of 7:29.8. Meanwhile both the varsity four and second varsity eight qualified for the Grand Finals, each placing sixth with times of 8:03.7 and 7:11.5, respectively. The team finished the event ranked third in Division II.
Men’s crew looks to conclude 
its phenomenal season June 4 through June 7 in its first-ever IRA Championships. Back into action a little sooner, women’s crew com-UPNEXT

See CREW page 11F or the 10th straight year, the men’s tennis team earned 
its way into the postseason, drawing a matchup with No. 5 Hawaii Pacific University in a Division-II West 
Regional showdown this afternoon. The Tritons finished the season with an oscillating 12-10 mark, but is building momentum as it hits the home stretch. Last year, the Tritons earned a berth in the second round and in 2007 made the program’s first-ever Final Four before losing to Valdosta State University.
Over the last two weeks, UCSD has won four of its last 
five to gain entrance into the regional as the No. 4 seed. The Tritons’ matchup with the Sea Warriors will take place in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, with the victor earning a coveted spot in the NCAA Championships from May 13 to May 16 in Altamonte Springs, Fla. 
“I feel like I’ve been through it all during my four years 
and through my stories and experiences, I feel I’ve helped the freshman class not make the same mistakes I made, ” said senior Kazumi Negishi, UCSD’s No. 1 singles and doubles player. BASEBALL By Janani Sridharan  Sports Editor
For the first time ever, UCSD will enter the California Collegiate Athletic Association as the No. 1 seed. Unfortunately for the Tritons, their first-round matchup 
comes against the only team they failed to defeat in a four-game series over the last two months. 
The Tritons (33-12, 27-9 CCAA), who are ranked No. 4 in 
Division II, will face Cal State Dominguez Hills (34-19, 23-13 CCAA) at 3 p.m. in Palm Springs today to open the conference tournament. The Tritons and Toros faced off April 16 to April 18 — UCSD took two at home before falling twice on the road. 
Since then, UCSD finished its season winning six of its 
last eight games and claiming the CCAA regular-season title. UCSD is coming off an emotional 3-1 victory in a four-game set against Cal Poly Pomona in which the team swept a Senior Day doubleheader. The Toros also finished strong, taking five of their last six games to clinch the final playoff spot.
Second-seeded Sonoma State University and third-seeded 
Cal State Los Angeles will also play tomorrow, and the winners of the semifinal contests will face off in the championship game on Friday at 3 p.m.

See M. TENNIS page 11A fter winning the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association regular-season title with an unde-feated record for the sixth consecutive season, the 
UCSD women’s tennis team now turns its sights toward postseason play. 
The Tritons are set to host No. 15 Hawaii Pacific 
University on Saturday in a West Regional matchup. No. 10 UCSD (15-5, 9-0 CCAA) earned the program’s 28th straight berth in the postseason under head coach Liz LaPlante. The Tritons enter their showdown with Hawaii University (17-5) on a three-match win streak with their confidence riding high.
Earlier this season, the Tritons and Sea Warriors 
engaged in an exhilarating battle that saw UCSD squeak past Hawaii Pacific by the slimmest of margins, handing the Sea Warriors their first loss of the year thanks to clutch performances from junior Anita Athavale and senior Tessa Tran. Athavale earned two points for the Tritons by winning at No. 2 doubles and coming back from a one-set-deficit at the No. 3 singles spot. Meanwhile, Tran,
