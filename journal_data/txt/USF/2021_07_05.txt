As Tropical Storm Elsa approaches the Tampa Bay area, USF announced Monday all classes will be shifted online and buildings shut down across campuses from Tuesday to Thursday.


In-person classes are expected to resume Thursday if the weather allows, according to a universitywide email sent Monday afternoon. Housing, dining and USF Health clinical facilities will remain open while other buildings will shut down as a safety measure for the storm.


St. Pete and Sarasota-Manatee campus buildings closed at 3 p.m. Monday and Tampa buildings are expected to close Tuesday at 7 a.m. The Bull Runner will be out of service this week as well.


The university will continue to monitor the storm in the coming days. All operations are set to resume by Thursday afternoon.
