USF senior safety Hassan Childs is in stable condition after being injured in a shooting Saturday night at a Tampa apartment complex, according to Tampa police.


At around 11:15 p.m. Saturday, Tampa police received a call from Jovanni Jimenez, 26, saying that a man, later identified as Childs, pulled a gun on him, his wife and child at the Eagles Point Apartments at Tampa Palms, 14551 N 46th St.


According to police, the incident began as a road rage incident, which then escalated to Jimenez pulling his own gun and firing at Childs, hitting him three times, in the upper arm and torso.


Jimenez told police the shooting was in self-defense.


“Thankfully Hassan is in stable condition and being well cared for, and no one else was injured,” coach Charlie Strong said in a statement. “There is an ongoing investigation of the incident and we are in the process of gathering further information.


“Out of respect for the integrity of the investigation, we cannot comment further at this time.”


The case has been forwarded to the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office to determine whether charges should be filed.


According to Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office records, Jimenez was charged, but not prosecuted, for misdemeanor domestic violence two years ago. Jimenez also pled no-contest after an arrest in February 2012 for misdemeanor charges of opposing an officer without violence.


Childs has no criminal record in Florida.
