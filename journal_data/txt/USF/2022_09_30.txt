As Hurricane Ian posed a threat to Tampa Bay, USF Athletics had to adjust game schedules for the week.


Here is how the storm impacted Athletics this week.


Football


USF Athletics announced Tuesday that USF football will move its home game against ECU to the FAU Stadium in Boca Raton on Saturday.


The Bulls will kick off against the Pirates at 2:30 p.m. The game will be streamed on ESPN+ and broadcast on Bulls Unlimited.


Volleyball


USF women’s volleyball traveled to UCF in hopes to reschedule its previously scheduled matches against Tulsa and Wichita State.


Both games are still postponed as the hurricane affected the Orlando area.


If the schedule changes, officials will provide updates as soon as possible.


Soccer


Women’s soccer was unaffected by the storm and traveled to Atlanta earlier this week. It is unknown as to when they traveled from Atlanta to Southern Methodist, but the team is slated to play the Mustangs at 8 p.m. Thursday night.


Men’s soccer was supposed to face Charlotte on Friday, but the game has been rescheduled to Oct. 26 in North Carolina.


Cross Country


South Florida cross country canceled its attendance at the Paul Short Run in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania as Hurricane Ian made it difficult to travel.


To make up for the missed event, the Bulls decided to participate in the FSU Invitational on Oct. 7 in Tallahassee.


Golf


Both the men’s and women’s golf programs were unaffected by the hurricane. The men competed in Evanston, Illinois on Monday and Tuesday and the women in Virginia Beach, Virginia on Thursday and Friday.
