After a mostly down year for the USF Formula
SAE
racing team, which could only participate in one competition last semester, things may be
looking up once again for the team.



After defending its Top 10 finish in Lincoln, Neb. by finishing
10th
in the spring, the team has accomplished something they’ve been aiming at for a while – becoming known on campus.



Placed display for students, the team’s 2011 car was moved in front of the elevators in the Marshall Student Center.



“It’s a high-traffic area and it’s a good way to get our name out there,” Chris Smith, president of USF’s racing team, said. “It’s been up since last Wednesday and we’re already getting people by the shop. From what I can see, it’s been a success.”



Smith said he hopes the success doesn’t stop here and students can expect to see more cars around campus.



“Hopefully we can get to other places around campus,” Smith said. “Our goal as a team is to get people involved and keep the organization going as long as possible.”



When future students are given tours of the campus, Smith said he wants them to see the team’s cars, a goal they plan to complete over the course of the coming year.
