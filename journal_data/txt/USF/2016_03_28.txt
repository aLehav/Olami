Freshman point guard Jahmal McMurray is set to explore his options and enter the NBA draft, according to the school.


What may seem like a shock to some, given that he’s only played one season for a team that finished 8-25 last season, is most likely an exploratory move by McMurray to gauge NBA interest.


Under a new rule instituted by the NCAA his season, student athletes are allowed to return to collegiate competition if they remove their name fromt the draft prior to a set date. With this, younger players can get an idea of where they stand without jeopardizing their college careers.


The NCAA established the rule stating players can participate in the combine and attend one private workout, if requested, before making the call. This year’s scouting combine runs from May 11-15, making the deadline for McMurray May 25.


Athletes can go through this process each year without losing eligibility.


“I’m excited to be having this conversation regarding Jahmal or any of our players,” coach Orlando Antigua said in a press release. “Jahmal really developed and grew throughout the season and we are happy he has the ability to explore his options under the new NCAA rules. He won’t sign with an agent, but he will get the opportunity to have an NBA evaluation both on his current skill level and areas to develop in the future.”
