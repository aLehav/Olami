USF has fired men’s basketball coach Stan Heath, according to a release from USF Athletics.


Less than 72 hours after Mark Harlan was introduced as former Athletic Director Doug Woolard’s successor, Heath was relieved of his duties on Friday.


The Bulls’ season ended
Wednesday
night in the AAC tournament, where they lost 72-68 to Rutgers, a team that lost 92-31 to Louisville the next day.


USF finished last in the conference and had back-to-back 12-win seasons following the school’s first NCAA Tournament appearance in 20 years in 2012.


The Bulls finished the 2013-14 season on a nine-game losing streak, and had 14 losses in 15 games in one stretch during 2012-13.


Of late, Heath’s son Josh, a freshman guard, had seen increased playing time and was elevated from possible redshirt status to a key role in Heath’s rotation in the absence of injured point guard Anthony Collins.


An email from Brian Siegrist, USF Associate Athletic Director for Communications, said Harlan will lead a national search for a head coach replacement.
