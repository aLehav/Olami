On day two of the 2022 Major League Baseball Draft, the Philadelphia Phillies selected redshirt sophomore pitcher Orion Kerkering.


In the fifth round as the 152nd pick, Kerkering became the first Bull in 2022 to be claimed by the big leagues and the 128th in South Florida history.


While at USF, Kerkering put in the work on the mound over the course of three years. He pitched 129.1 innings with 167 strikeouts, two of those years being a regular closer and his final year working in the starting rotation.


Kerkering was a key asset during South Floridaâ€™s 2021 postseason run, where he showcased some of his most dominant pitching. As a closer, he claimed the win against South Alabama in the Gainesville Regional final to lead the Bulls to its first Super Regional.


The Bull was ranked third in the AAC for the 2022 season, with 91 strikeouts in 67.2 innings pitched along with leading the conference in batters struck out looking. Kerkering held the 32nd ranking in NCAA pitching as well.


This prospect made a valuable contribution to the Bulls rotation and bullpen and will continue to do so as he takes his first steps into his professional career.
