USF System President Judy Genshaft is a member of the board of Fresh Mark, a family-owned business in Salem, Ohio, that was the scene of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid Tuesday afternoon that resulted in 146 arrests.


Fresh mark was founded by Genshaft’s father in 1920 and her brother Neil currently serves as the CEO. According to the company’s website, “Fresh Mark has been supplying American-made bacon, ham, hotdogs and deli meats for nearly 100 years.”


The news of Genshaft’s ties to the company was first reported by Fox 13 on Wednesday.


University spokesman Adam Freeman told The Oracle in an email that Genshaft sits on the board of the company, but has “no involvement in the company's daily operations.” Freeman declined to comment further on the matter because he said the issue “does not involve university business.”


Brittany Julian, a spokeswoman for Fresh Mark, also said that Genshaft is not involved with the day-to-day operations of the company.


“Judy Genshaft does not have any involvement with the events that occurred in our facilities on Tuesday, June 19,” Julian said in an email to The Oracle.


As the investigation into the matter continues, 66 people have been released as of Thursday morning, according to WFMJ news, a NBC affiliate out of Youngstown-Warren, Ohio.
