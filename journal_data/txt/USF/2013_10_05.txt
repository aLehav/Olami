USF (1-4) held off a late rally by the Cincinnati
Bearcats
(3-2)
Saturday
night and delivered the first win of the Willie Taggart era, 26-20.






The Bullsâ€™ American Athletic Conference season started off on a familiar tone for USF, as Cincinnati ripped the ball from USF senior running back Marcus Shaw.






With 24 yards separating the Cincinnati from an early touchdown, USF kept the
Bearcats
out of the end zone before junior tight end Mike McFarland blocked a
Bearcat
field goal attempt. Freshman safety Nate Godwin picked up the ball and took it 75 yards to jump out to a 7-0 lead.






With
13:45
left in the second quarter, senior kicker Marvin
Kloss
connected on his second field goal of the night, a
52-yarder
to make it 13-0.






Cincinnati senior quarterback Brendon Kay threw a 22-yard touchdown pass with about ten minutes left in the second quarter, but the
Bearcats
missed the extra point which made it 13-6 in favor of USF.






Fellow seniors Julius Forte and
DeDe

Lattimore
collaborated on a defensive touchdown later in the second quarter when Forte forced a fumble near the ten yard line and
Lattimore
recovered and ran it in to make it 20-6.






It was the third time Forte, a reserve, caused a turnover for USF this year. After two more
Kloss
field goals, USF owned a 26-6 lead through the end of the third quarter.






Kay found sophomore receiver Chris Moore wide open in the
endzone
for a touchdown to make it 26 -13.






He then found sophomore receiver
Mehale
McKay in the middle of the end zone to make it 26-20 with
2:03
left in the game after an 11-play 78-yard drive.






USF recovered an onside kick and ran down the clock to triple zeros, leaving the small Raymond James Stadium crowd in a frenzy.
