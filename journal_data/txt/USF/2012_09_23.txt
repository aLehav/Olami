The Chick-fil-A socio-political-religious calamity all commenced with company president Dan Cathy’s worldly perspective on the institution of marriage: “We’re inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say we know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage. And I pray God’s mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude that thinks we have the audacity to redefine what marriage is all about.”


While I don’t condone the archaic viewpoint of marriage or the governmental involvement in human relationships, this cause should be combated away from school grounds.


Unless there’s a monstrous student, faculty and administrator outcry over Chick-fil-A’s corporate donations and every single individual in this collective body disagrees wholeheartedly, the cause is going nowhere.


However, I encourage those individuals who realistically have the time to join Dr. Scott Ferguson’s mission.


Otherwise, don’t cleverly entrap people who simply desire to eat an item from Chick-fil-A’s menu or who work for the company to support themselves to detest the organization altogether.


If we portray ourselves to be civil adults, let’s act as so.
