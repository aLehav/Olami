The USF men’s tennis team was defeated 6-1 on Sunday in the first of two meetings scheduled this season against No. 19 UCF.


The Bulls are now 2-2 overall, having only played away matches thus far. The team lost to UF in Gainesville to open the season, but managed two consecutive 4-3 victories against Clemson and Auburn.


However, on Sunday the Knights put an end to these winning ways, managing a comprehensive victory over the Bulls. USF marginally avoided a sweep against its rivals with a singles victory that came late through junior Sergio Gomez Montesa.


Gomez Montesa’s point was awarded after he bested UCF’s Bogdan Pavel 6-
4, 7-5 and 6-3.


While the loss may be disappointing, coach Ashley Fisher focused on using the result as a learning experience going into upcoming matches.


“Credit to UCF today for outplaying us. They played a complete match and deserved the win,” Fisher said. “We generated opportunities in doubles and some singles courts but just couldn’t take advantage.


“We will learn from this and do a better job of preparing our guys. Next weekend we get back to building and investing.”


The Bulls are set to play their next match against Stetson on Saturday. It will be the team’s first home contest of the season.
