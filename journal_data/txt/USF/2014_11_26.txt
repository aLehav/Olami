USF will not have the Bulls Blitz buses for students to ride to Raymond James Stadium for Friday’s football game against UCF, according to an announcement by Student Government’s via Facebook on Tuesday.


SG Chief of Staff Greg Berkowitz said the decision to cancel the transportation was made after SG conducted a survey on social media and found a majority of those polled were going to be away from the stadium for Thanksgiving or were going to the UCF game but would not take the Bulls Blitz.


Berkowitz said over 100 students took the survey.


Based on the survey results, Berkowitz said SG did not want to waste student money to operate the shuttles.


For those wishing to view the game from campus, the game will be broadcast on ESPN2 with a noon kickoff.
