Tampa Fire Rescue evacuated
the seven-story Interdisciplinary Sciences (ISA) building around noon on Wednesday
after eight students reported feeling dizzy in a short increment of time.


Faculty and students were let back into the building around 2 p.m.


USF spokesperson Adam Freeman said the USF Environmental Health and Safety and Tampa Fire Rescue conducted air quality tests and there was no evidence of abnormal air quality.


Seven people were treated at the scene by
Tampa Fire Rescue personnel and one individual was transported to the hospital for evaluation. There was no information on the individual's current condition but the person reported not feeling well since Tuesday night.


Several students said they were in the sun before entering the building, which leaves reason to believe that the dizziness was heat related. Feel-like temperatures were over 100 degrees in Tampa on Wednesday afternoon.


Freeman said additional tests will be done throughout the building Thursday out of an “
abundance of caution.”
