Last month, the Board of Governors named Stanley Levy to the BOT.



The 12 members of the current BOT, which meets regularly to plan academic, financial and strategic goals for the university, include local business people, executives, a faculty representative and the student body president. The board seeks one additional member whose term expires in January 2016.
