USF football saw three of its players earn all-conference accolades on Wednesday when the All-AAC team was announced. The All-AAC team is voted on by the conferenceâ€™s head coaches.


Tight end Mitchell Wilcox was named to the All-AAC first team, linebacker Khalid McGee was named to the second team and cornerback Mike Hampton was an honorable mention.


Wilcox caught 40 passes this season for 506 yards and set a USF program record for receptions by tight ends in a game against Illinois on Sept. 15 with eight. Wilcox, a junior, is just six receptions away from tying Sean Price (75) for the program record for career receptions by a tight end.


McGee was named to the All-AAC second team after transitioning from safety to linebacker this season. McGee recorded 104 tackles, which is the 15th 100-tackle season in program history. He sits second in the conference with 9.5 tackles per game and posted double-digit tackles in five games.


In his first season as a starter, Hampton ranked ninth nationally in passes defended. Hampton, a sophomore, recorded 41 tackles and two interceptions in 10 starts.


Wilcox, McGee and Hampton will look to build on their season when USF learns about its upcoming bowl game sometime this weekend.
