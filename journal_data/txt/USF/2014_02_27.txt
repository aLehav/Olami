When an actor or actress wins an Oscar, it is because he or she gave a commanding performance that cannot be compared.

Mcconaughey
has been hiding while taking roles in flops such as “Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.” He will win, because though others nominated gave excellent performances, he surpassed by leaps and bounds.

Jared
Leto
– “Dallas Buyers Club”

Nominees
:



Jennifer Lawrence – “American Hustle”




Lupita Nyong’o – “12 Years a Slave”




June Squibb – “Nebraska”




Julia Roberts – “August: Osage County”




Sally Hawkins – “Blue Jasmine”



Who should win
: June Squibb – “Nebraska”




June Squibb’s age and years of experience is the reason her performance surpassed any other in this category. Her direct portrayal of Will Forte’s mother in “Nebraska” was the beacon of light in the independent flick. Lawrence is favored to win, and though it is well deserved, it will mainly be due to the over hype of the film as Squibb’s performance gets brushed aside.



Who likely will win:
Jennifer Lawrence – “American Hustle”




Who could win:
Lupita Nyong’o – “12 Years a Slave”




Who should have made the list:
Kristen Wiig (“The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”)
