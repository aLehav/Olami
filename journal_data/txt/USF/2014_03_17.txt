Despite the students’ cheers at last month’s announcement of his visit to USF, actor Matthew Perry canceled his lecture on campus.



According to a press release on Friday, Perry canceled his lecture on April 8 due to scheduling conflict with filming for a new television pilot. Perry is an Emmy-nominated actor best known for his work as Chandler Bing on the long-running television show “Friends.”



Perry’s lecture was announced Feb. 14 as the final lecture in the University Lecture Series (ULS), sponsored by the Center for Student Involvement. In January, Student Government approved a $40,000 addition to the ULS budget so that the program could bring an “internationally recognized speaker” to campus during USF Week in April.



A replacement for Perry in the lecture series has not yet been announced.
