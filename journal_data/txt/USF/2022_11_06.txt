USF football coach Jeff Scott was fired effective immediately, Vice President and Director of USF Athletics Michael Kelly announced Sunday. Special Teams Coordinator Daniel Da Prato will serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2022 season.


The announcement comes after USF’s (1-8, 0-5) 54-28 loss to Temple on Saturday, extending his record to 4-26. So far this season, the Bulls haven’t won any conference games, and have only won one since 2019.


“I will miss this team and will do anything in my power to help them in the future. I am disappointed that our hard work didn’t translate to more success on the field, but I am confident that we have set a new foundation,” Scott said. “I know the future of USF football is bright and my family and I will always remember our time at USF as a very special chapter in our lives.”


Kelly also announced that defensive coordinator Bob Shoop was fired. Co-defensive coordinator Ernie Sims will take over the Bulls’ defense.


“When Jeff came to Tampa in December of 2019, we had high expectations for where he could take our football program,” Kelly said. “While he did so many things right, including rebuilding our culture, pushing forward our Indoor Performance Facility and engaging our community, the on-the-field results fell well below our standards.”
