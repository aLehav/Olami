Frequent USF donors Frank and Carol Morsani gifted the university several million dollars for new roles and scholarship opportunities. SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE/USF


Longtime philanthropists and Tampa Bay community leaders Frank and Carol Morsani pledged $7 million to USF on Tuesday.


The donation will go toward an endowed chair in geriatrics, student scholarships as well as a directorship and professorship focused on ethical leadership in business.


With the intent to support students as tuition prices increase over time, a part of the donation will fund the new Morsani scholarship, Frank said in a press release. No further information on how students will be selected for the scholarship was provided.


“Change is the only constant we have,” Frank said. “It’s through education we can move and handle that change. We could think of no greater way to return the benefits we have earned over our lifetimes than to empower young people through education.”


Their donation for an endowed chair in geriatrics is not the first time the College of Medicine has seen contributions from the Morsani family. In 2011, the college was named after them following a $37 million donation to USF Health.


The Morsani’s have been a prominent contributor to USF’s development since the ‘70s. Other contributions include donations made to USF Athletics, the Muma College of Business and WUSF Public Media. This past March they pledged $5 million for the on-campus football stadium project.
