With the fourth quarter winding down and the game well in hand for USF, Marlon Mack found a hole in the UConn defense and broke through for a 34-yard rushing touchdown in USF’s 42-27 win over the Huskies on Saturday night.


The score marked Mack’s 26th rushing touchdown as a Bull, moving him past former quarterback B.J. Daniels for most in school history. If not for a fumble inside the opponent’s 5-yard line, the record would have been broken much earlier in the night.


“I’m disappointed he didn’t get 27, he fumbled on the one,” coach Willie Taggart said. “I’m mad at him, but I love him. I’m proud of Mack for breaking that record and all of his accomplishments, but I think Marlon will be the first one to tell you that doesn’t mean a lot to him. He would rather have a perfect game and not turn the ball over than all of those things.”


In the record-setting game, Mack ran for 107 yards and a score on 16 carries. He also had six catches for 75 yards.


Entering halftime, USF led 14-3 in what appeared to be yet another low-scoring affair between the conference opponents. However, the offense was ignited after the Bulls fell behind early in the third quarter.


Powered by the duo of Mack and Quinton Flowers, USF scored 28 points in the second-half as the two combined for 264 rushing yards on the night.


With USF (6-1, 3-0) now bowl eligible, Mack will look to continue his conquest on the record books when the Bulls travel to play at Temple on Friday.
