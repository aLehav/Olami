Laquincy Rideau scored 21 points in USF’s victory at Memphis on Saturday. SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE/USF ATHLETICS


Call it a revenge win — it came against a team the Bulls blew a 15-point lead against just last month.


Call it a statement win — it was the first Quad 1 victory of coach Brian Gregory’s tenure at USF.


Call it whatever you want — but the end result is USF men’s basketball (11-12, 4-6) has its most memorable winning streak in recent memory. After defeating UCF for the first time in almost five years last weekend at the Yuengling Center, USF knocked off Memphis 75-73 on Saturday at FedEx Forum.


Three Bulls scored in double figures. David Collins and Laquincy Rideau each scored 21, while Justin Brown had 14. Brown also recorded a career-high 16 rebounds for his second double-double of the season.


USF led for all but 11 minutes, which was not unlike their Jan. 12 loss to the Tigers (17-6, 6-4) at the Yuengling Center, where the Bulls led for all but 12.


Except, unlike the game in Tampa, where USF did not make a field goal in the game’s final 6:37, the Bulls were able to hit baskets late — including a critical  layup by Collins with just under a minute remaining.


“We felt we let some things slip away in the first game, especially defensively and on the glass, but I thought we had a great chance to come in here and get a win if we tightened those things up,” coach Brian Gregory said in a statement. “To the credit of our guys, they played with great toughness, energy and intensity, and stuck together during some tough times during the game. When Memphis made runs, we were able to respond, which was key.”


The Bulls can put together their first four-game winning streak of the season when they return to the Yuengling Center to face Houston on Wednesday at 9 p.m.
