USF President Rhea Law extended Vice President of Athletics Michael Kelly’s contract through 2028, the university announced Wednesday.


Kelly had one year left on the contract he signed when he joined USF in August 2018. The contract extension runs through June 2028.


“[Kelly] continues to prove that he’s the right person to lead USF Athletics into the future,” Law said. “With Michael in place, and our leadership across the university aligned on a shared vision for USF Athletics, we are well positioned to take our programs to the next level.”


That shared vision is headlined by the university’s public push to build an on-campus football stadium, an ambition that has had several stops and starts for years. Kelly is currently serving as co-chair on the university’s committee for the project.


“I am very excited for the future of USF Athletics and the opportunity to continue to lead our tremendous student-athletes, coaches and staff into what I believe will be the most successful and transformational period in our 56 years of collegiate athletics at the University of South Florida,” Kelly said.
