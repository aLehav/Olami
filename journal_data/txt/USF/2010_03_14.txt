KEY WEST – Ernest Hemingway’s home in Key West has been designated a literary landmark.


Officials gathered Sunday afternoon to celebrate the landmark status at a ceremony on the grounds of Hemingway’s house on Whitehead Street. The designation is given by a division of the American Library Association.


Hemingway lived in the house from 1931 through 1939 and wrote many of his manuscripts in the property’s second-story writing studio. The Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-winning author owned the property until his death in 1961. It is now a museum.


The Spanish colonial house is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the eighth site in Key West to receive the literary landmark designation.
