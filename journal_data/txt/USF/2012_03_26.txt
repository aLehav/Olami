An article in Thursdays Oracle, did not state Khalid Hassounehs full name on first reference.


In the same article, (BOARD OF GOVERNORS ARTICLE) Hassouneh said it is yet to be determined whether USF will appeal the Board of Governors Budget Committees rejection of the Academic Enrichment fee. There is no appeals process in place until the full Board of Governors votes, and USF retracted its proposal before the full Board voted.
