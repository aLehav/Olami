A male student reported being raped by an unknown male suspect in the Campus Recreation Center locker room Friday morning, according to a University Police (UP) community notification.



According to the release, the suspect was described as a black male in his
30s
, between 6-foot-1 and 6-foot-3 with a fade haircut and black sandals. Those with more information are requested to contact UP, who are looking to identify the suspect.



Anyone entering the
Rec
Center is required to swipe a USF ID at the front desk.



Memberships for non-USF affiliates are only given to people with USF IDs, family members, Veteran’s Affairs staff and
Moffitt

Lt. Charlotte Domingo, UP Public Information Officer, said UP’s investigation into the case is still on-going. According to Domingo, UP conducted “heightened special checks” of the
Rec
Center throughout the weekend and security has had a “continuous
present” during the Recreation Center’s hours of operation.
