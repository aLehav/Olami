It took USF athletic director Mark Harlan just five days after the conclusion of the Bullsâ€™ 2016-17 season to find a new coach.


A report from Jon Rothstein of FanRag Sports early Tuesday morning said USF will hire former Dayton and Georgia Tech coach Brian Gregory to replace former coach Orlando Antigua.


Gregory, 50, made the NCAA Tournament twice and the NIT three times with Dayton, but qualified for the NIT just once in five seasons at Georgia Tech. He was fired from the school following the 2015-16 season.


Gregory spent this past season as a consultant for Michigan State, which was selected as a nine seed in the NCAA Tournament this season.
