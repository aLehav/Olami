Javain Brown scored the game-winner Tuesday.
SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE/GOUSFBULLS


Prior to Friday night, USF men’s soccer sophomore defender Javain Brown had yet to record as much as a point in his collegiate career.


Brown now has two goals to his name — and they’re both game-winners.


After scoring the deciding goal Friday night against UConn off a corner kick in the 81st minute, Brown scored off another corner Tuesday night in the Bulls’ 1-0 win against Florida Gulf Coast at Corbett Stadium.


Brown’s goal would be all the offense the Bulls (6-2, 1-0 AAC) needed, as USF’s backline only allowed one shot on target as senior goalkeeper Harrison Devenish-Meares recorded his third clean sheet of the season.


“I am just proud of my guys and the way they responded to different things,” coach Bob Butehorn told GoUSFBulls.com after the game. “We created a number of chances and I think that we are getting close, but in all honesty, it was just a good game on a Tuesday night which is sometimes very difficult.”


The game also marked the return of freshman striker Victor Claudel, who last played Sept. 13 before going down with an injury. The forward recorded one shot over 58 minutes.


The Bulls have won their last three games and six of their last seven. USF returns to AAC play Saturday with a road game against Tulsa.
