Nicholas Athan, the 20-year-old student who was struck while riding his bicycle on campus last week, has been released from Tampa General Hospital (TGH).


Athan, a junior majoring in history and mathematics, was hit by a black pickup truck on USF Bull Run Drive near USF Orange Drive on Wednesday. He was airlifted to TGH shortly after the accident.


Athan’s condition could not be released by TGH for privacy reasons.


Francisco Hernandez, the driver of the truck, was arrested on the scene and charged with reckless driving and driving with a suspended license, said University Police Sgt. Mike Klingebiel.


Hernandez, a construction worker for LEI Construction Inc., was released from the Orient Road Jail on Saturday after his $4,000 bond was posted.


Klingebiel said Hernandez is not affiliated with the University.


Hernandez’s reason for being on campus at the time of the accident is unknown.


Athan and representatives from LEI Construction were not available to comment.
