Continuing to build on the little things is what the USF women’s soccer team is focusing on after playing two Top 25 teams last week.



After suffering their first defeat in a 1-0 lost to No. 17 South Carolina on the road and drawing 1-1 against No. 8 Florida at home, the Bulls (4-1-3) are back at Corbett Stadium to end non-conference play Friday night against South Alabama (7-1-1).



Being more vocal on the field is one of the things the Bulls are working on this week of practice during the absence of head coach Denise
Schilte-Brown
, who had to take the week off for personal matters.



Junior midfielder Sarah Miller, who has a goal and two assists on the season, said the team members are working on keeping their hips straight when receiving the ball.



“One of them is when we receive the ball in the middle, you don’t want to keep your hips to one side. You want to open it to the whole field so you can see it,” Miller said. “You’re kind of checking your shoulder, but when you receive it, your first touch should be forward. You don’t always want to be going backwards.”



She also said they are practicing on building on the backs so they can create a 2-2-1 on the outside.



Schilte-Brown
will return Friday night when the South Alabama Jaguars come into Tampa with victories over Murray State and Alabama A&M. The Jaguars are currently on a three-game winning streak.



The match is set to start at 7:30 p.m.
