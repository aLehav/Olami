When it comes to weather lately, if USF baseball didn’t have bad luck, it would have no luck at all.


After having its series with No. 5 North Carolina altered due to heavy rain — the Bulls and Tar Heels played all three games in a span of 22 hours — USF has had another game on its schedule affected by rain.


The Bulls’ home game Tuesday against No. 13 FSU was canceled due to heavy rain. No makeup date has been set.


Tuesday would have been FSU’s first visit to USF since 2016 and the Seminoles’ fourth trip since 1998.


USF announced it will refund fans who purchased tickets to Tuesday's game within five business days.


Should the weather hold up, the Bulls will return to the field Friday at 7 p.m. to host Western Michigan in the first of a three-game series.


The good news is that the weather forecast for Friday night calls for 75 degrees and a 3 percent chance of rain.
