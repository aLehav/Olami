Mitchell Wilcox led USF with 28 receptions for 350 yards in 2019.
SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE/USF ATHLETICS


For the second straight year, no former Bull was selected in the NFL Draft.


However, a pair have already signed as undrafted free agents in the wake of the league‚Äôs first ever virtual draft, where Commissioner Roger Goodell announced early-round picks from his basement in Bronxville, New York,
looking at times more like Fred Rogers than normal Roger Goodell.


Tight end Mitchell Wilcox, who in some mock drafts was a projected seventh-round pick, signed with the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday afternoon. Wilcox led the Bulls with 28 receptions for 350 yards and five touchdowns in 2019, ultimately leading to an invite to both the East-West Shrine Bowl in January as well as an NFL Combine in February. He ended his USF career as the program‚Äôs all-time record holder as a tight end for receiving yards (1,326), receptions (100) and touchdowns (11).


Wilcox joins a Bengals team that drafted LSU quarterback Joe Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick after going 2-14 last season. Cincinnati has not qualified for the playoffs since the 2015 season nor has it won a playoff game since the 1990 season.

Defensive end Greg Reaves signed with the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday. Reaves tied for the team lead in sacks with 4.0 and tied for second in tackles for loss with 10.0 in 2019. He finished his USF career with 212 tackles, 30.5 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks and six pass break-ups.




Congrats,

Los Angeles finished third in the NFC West last season with a 9-7 record, not qualifying for the playoffs a season after losing to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII. The Rams should still have plenty of eyes on them this season, as they are scheduled to open their lavish new home, SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, after playing the last four seasons at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
