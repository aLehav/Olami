With National Signing Day looming Wednesday, The Oracle looks back at the marquee names of the 2010 recruiting class and their first-year impacts.


Cornerback Terrence Mitchell:


Mitchell came to USF as a late steal from FSU and as one of the highest rated recruits in USF history.


Recruited as a cornerback, Mitchell made his biggest impact on the field as an electrifying punt returner. Mitchell made the switch from defense to wide receiver prior to the Cincinnati game.


He played in all 13 games during his freshman season, returning 21 kicks for a total of 232 yards.


Mitchell’s average of 11 yards per return made him the top freshman punt returner in the country and 23rd best overall.


Phil Steele, Rivals.com and the Football Writers Association of America named Mitchell to three Freshman All-American teams after his debut season.


Safety Mark Joyce:


Safety Mark Joyce played in all 13 games, starting one, for the Bulls as a true freshman.


Joyce recorded his first interception against Western Kentucky and returned it for 33 yards.


He totaled 33 tackles on the season and also forced a fumble in USF’s victory over Miami.


Running Back Marcus Shaw:


Rated by Rivals.com as the 17th best running back, Shaw struggled for playing time as a true freshman in a talented and deep running back platoon, but made an impact when given the chance.


Shaw played in eight games, totaling 12 carries for 105 yards.


Against Stony Brook, Shaw led all Bulls with 77 rushing yards, including a 63-yard touchdown run.
