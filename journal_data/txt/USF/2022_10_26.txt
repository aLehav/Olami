Two new traffic lights covered with black bags on Bruce B. Downs Boulevard that likely won’t go live until January.


At the intersection of Bruce B. Downs Boulevard with Richard Silver Way, as well as with Campus Hill Drive, new traffic lights were put in place.


The county project was created to increase safety, according to Hillsborough County Senior Media Relations Strategist Chris Wilkerson. This was not only for pedestrians, such as students, but also cars entering and leaving the James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital on Richard Silver Way.


The intersection at Richard Silver Way is also the closest to IQ Luxury Apartments, an off-campus student housing complex.


The nearest intersections with active traffic signals to the hospital and apartment complex are at 131st Street and University Square Drive.


The $4.9 million project was
announced in August 2021
. It was expected to be completed by the end of 2022, but a delay in materials needed for the traffic signals’ mast arm extended the project.


Within the next couple weeks, the lights will blink yellow or red for a couple months to get the community familiar with the lights, according to Wilkerson. By January the lights should officially be functioning. They include new pedestrian activated features such as digital crossing signs, he said.
