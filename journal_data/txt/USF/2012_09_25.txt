The USF womens tennis team started its fall season with a strong performance in Georgia last weekend.


Junior Loreto Martinez and sophomore Paula Montoya came up big at the Southern Shootout in Atlanta, going a combined 5-1, including a 3-0 record from Martinez. Coach Agustin Moreno praised both of his players.


It showed theyve been working hard over the summer and thats why they played well. It pays off, Moreno said.


Martinez took down Chloe Smith of NC State on Sunday by scores of 6-0 and 6-3, while Montoya beat Christy Snipes, 6-1 and 6-2. The Bulls won three of the five matches played on Sundays shootout finale.


Both Martinez and senior Katie Vasenina will head to California this weekend, where they will play doubles in the Riviera All-American Championships in Palisades.
