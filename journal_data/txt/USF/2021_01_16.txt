The USF womenâ€™s basketball game scheduled for Jan. 17 versus the Memphis Tigers has been canceled, the AAC announced Saturday.


The game was called off after Memphis decided it was unable to play
due to health and safety concerns involving its roster.


This is the second game of the season for the Bulls that has either been canceled or postponed. The first was an earlier postponement of a matchup against Houston originally scheduled for Dec. 19.


Assuming no other issues arise, next up for USF is a Wednesday night contest against Wichita State with tipoff scheduled for 7 p.m.


The game will be televised on ESPN+ and broadcast on 95.3/620 WDAE/iHeartRadio Bulls Unlimited.
