After a regular season conference title and a hopeful NCAA tournament bid, the USF women’s basketball team added a few more accomplishments to their storied season.


No. 25 USF (23-5, 15-1 AAC) senior forward Dulcy Fankam Mendjiadeu and senior guard Elena Tsineke were unanimously named co-recipients of the AAC Women’s Basketball Player of the Year for the 2022-23 season.

Both of the standout seniors were honored for their excellent respective seasons, each finishing among the best of the positions in the entire NCAA.


This is the first time two players of the year have been awarded in the AAC since the 2016-17 season, where UConn forwards Katie Lou Samuelson and Naphessa Collier shared the honor.




Been calling for this for weeks! Well done by the voters, and of course by Dulcy and El. Or El and Dulcy.

Mendjiadeu finished her season with a career high 16.7 points per game. Her 12.6 rebounds per game was ranked fourth in Division I, and are the most since forward Wanda Guyton averaged 14.0 rebounds per game during the 1988-89 season.


The former Memphis transfer has had a historic season, as she was also named to the USBWA Ann Meyers Drysale National Player of the Year Watch List and Becky Hammon Mid-Major Player of the Year Award Midseason List.

Tsineke led the Bulls in scoring, racking up 18.0 points per game on an impressive 47% from the floor. She finished second in the conference and top 50 in the country in scoring.


The four-year veteran made 99 total starts, averaging over 10 points per game during her entire collegiate career.


Other Bulls were also honored by the AAC this season. Freshman wing Carla Brito was named to the AAC All-Freshman Team after an impressive first season. Junior guard Sammie Puisis was named as the AAC Newcomer of the Year after transferring from Florida State. Puisis finished first in the country in three-pointers.


South Florida will face Wichita State on Tuesday for its first AAC Tournament game. The top seeded Bulls are currently projected by CBS Sports to be a No. 6 or No. 7 seed for the upcoming NCAA tournament, where they are hoping to advance to the school’s first ever Sweet 16 berth.
