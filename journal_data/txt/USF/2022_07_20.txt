Former Arkansas and SMU head coach Chad Morris was named USF footballâ€™s senior analyst Monday afternoon by coach Jeff Scott.


Morris has previously worked alongside Scott when the two were a part of the offensive staff at Clemson. In 2011-14, the two carried the Tigers through a 42-11 season. This laid the groundwork for the team to win two national championships in 2016 and 2018.


Scottâ€™s once right-hand man led the Mustangs from 2015-17 and then the Razorbacks from 2018-19. He was fired from Arkansas after a 45-19 home loss to Western Kentucky.


He then served as an offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Auburn in 2020 before coaching the Allen High School football team in Texas last season.


Offensive Coordinator and quarterback coach Travis Trickett took to Twitter to express his excitement about Morris joining the staff.
