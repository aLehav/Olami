Though
Baz

Luhrmann’s
interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s beloved novel remains up for debate, the soundtrack produced by Jay-Z is topping charts.



Jay-Z seems to make the eclectic compilation of artists like will.i.am, Lana Del Rey, Florence + The Machine,
Gotye
, Andre 3000 and more work.



There are songs that have hints of the
1920s
jazz scene mixed with today’s rap scene, but most are soon-to-be hits from this era’s artists.


Here are the top five songs from the album:



“Young & Beautiful” by Lana Del Rey –



The song encompasses the
glamour
of the
20s
era while exhibiting the nature of the relationship between the lead characters Daisy and Gatsby.



“Bang Bang” by will.i.am –




Will.i.am begins the song with a
’20s
style jazzy scat and then leads it into a techno dance hit. The song was a great soundtrack to the epic party scene at Gatsby’s mansion.



“No Church in the Wild” by Jay-Z and
Kanye
West (featuring Frank Ocean and The Dream) –



The song is a great collaboration of the artists and displays each individual talent well. The song was a great choice for the theatrical trailers as it created a mysterious and dramatic tone that surrounds the film.



“Back to Black” by
AndrÃ©
3000 and
BeyoncÃ©
–



The duo brings Amy Winehouse’s hit back to life with a new twist. Though the song doesn’t fit well with the movie, it has a flow that will allow it to stand on it’s own.



“100$ Bill” by Jay-Z –



This song was the most noticeably out-of-place song throughout the entire film.  However, Jay-Z delivers with this tune which will be sure to be a huge radio hit due to it’s lyrical style and beats that Jay-Z is known for.
