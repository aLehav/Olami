Portions of the Collins parking garage are closed off to students so the structure can undergo sealant repairs,
according to
Director of Communication and Engagement
Aaron Nichols.


Sealant repairs are done to fill small openings in surfaces such as gaps in concrete, according to
WFM Media
. Nichols said the university periodically makes such repairs in order to maintain the structures of a building.

Work is being done on the south side of the fourth floor of the garage. Nichols said the area directly below the fourth-floor repairs is also closed off to prevent possible damage to parked vehicles.


Handrails in the stairway of the garage are also being repainted.


Nichols said the repairs will continue through the summer and be completed by the start of the fall semester. Though work is currently only being done in Collins, all parking garages will gradually receive this treatment.
