USF offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. is set to leave the program for the same position at Ole Miss, according to multiple reports Wednesday afternoon. He will join coach Lane Kiffin’s staff, replacing Jeff Lebby who left the Rebels to become offensive coordinator at Oklahoma.


Weis previously worked under Kiffin at both Alabama as an offensive analyst and Florida Atlantic where he became the youngest offensive coordinator in FBS history at just 25 years old.


Weis joined coach Jeff Scott in 2020, leading an offense that featured five different starting quarterbacks in just 21 games, finishing with a 3-18 record and just one win in conference play.


Due to the instability under center and an inconsistent run game, the Bulls’ offense sputtered throughout his tenure, finishing outside the top 100 in total offense and pass efficiency in the FBS.


Scott’s third season at the helm will now feature two brand new coordinators after defensive coordinator Glenn Spencer was let go during the season and replaced by
Bob Shoop on Dec. 6
