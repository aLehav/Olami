South Florida track and field traveled to Boston last weekend to compete in a pair of competitions and found themselves breaking school records.


USF participated in the Crimson Elite and Multi at Harvard on Friday and the Bruce Lehane Scarlet and White Invitational at Boston University on Saturday. Both events were indoor and featured 16 schools at Crimson Elite and Multi and 30 schools at the Bruce Lehane Scarlet and White Invitational.


On Friday, junior sprinter Zayquan Lincoln shattered the program record for the men’s indoor 60 meters with a time of 6.73. Along with finishing third in the competition, he ended ahead of the previous best of 6.74 held by former USF sprinters Lindsey Lamar in 2012 and Curtis Thomas in 2017.


Sophomore pole vaulter Kobe Babin tied for USF’s second best height at 5.27 meters (17-3.50) on Friday. Marking a new personal best, he placed second in competition.


After a successful first day, the Bulls continued to create new bests at the Bruce Lehane Scarlet and White Invitational. Sophomore distance runner Arden La-Rose claimed a new spot on the women’s 1000 meter run list with a time of 2:51.00. Freshman sprinter Je’Nyia Burton smashed a 10-year record with a time of 54.27 in the 400 meters race. She takes the spot from former USF distance runner Rachel James who carried the best of 57.29 in 2011.


Junior Shevioe Reid also broke the previous men’s 400 meter record with a time of 47.21 seconds. Prior to Reid, former USF sprinter Pascal Orelus held the spot since 2012.


Up next, the Bulls will travel to Chicago to compete in the Wisconsin Windy City Invitational from Feb. 10-11.


Men’s tennis falls short in Middle Tennessee


The Bulls came home empty handed after being on the road for the first time this season. USF lost to Middle Tennessee 7-0 on Friday and to Memphis 6-1 on Saturday.


The only point earned from the entire weekend was from junior Alvin Tudorica. He conquered the Tigers’ sophomore Conor Gannon 6-3 in the singles.


Both schools have ranked players that put up a fight for the Bulls in the singles competition. MTSU has No. 60 sophomore Oskar Bostrom Poulsen and No. 109 graduate student Francisco Rocha on the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Top 125. Pulsen pulled out a 6-2, 6-7 (3-7), 10-6 triumph over Tudorica. Rocha nailed a 6-4, 6-3 victory over junior Erik Grevelius.


Memphis’ roster features No. 39 sophomore Pablo Alemany and No. 114 senior David Stevenson. Junior Davide Tortora came up short 6-2, 2-0 when facing Alemany. Grevelius couldn’t keep up with Stevenson and fell 3-6, 6-4, 10-7.


Facing two ivy leagues this weekend, the Bulls will travel to New York to battle Cornell on Friday and Columbia on Sunday.


Women’s tennis blows out FAMU


South Florida women’s tennis rattled FAMU 7-0 on Friday at USF’s Varsity Tennis Courts, marking their first win in non-conference play.


The Bulls outdid the Rattlers in every competition in both singles and doubles for the second year in a row. Sophomore Margriet Timmermans finished first in the singles match 6-2, 6-1. Senior Laura Pellicer and freshman Cliona Walsh were in the hot seat but were able to get the final point 7-6, cementing USF’s clean sweep over FAMU in the doubles competition.


Looking to grab their fourth consecutive win over FAU, the Bulls will travel to Boca Raton this Saturday at noon.
