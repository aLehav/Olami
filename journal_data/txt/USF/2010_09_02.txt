After an exhibition win over No. 1 Akron on Saturday, USF coach George Kiefer’s squad was quickly grounded in its season opener, losing 2-1 to Florida Gulf Coast at the USF Soccer Stadium on Wednesday night.


With the score tied 0-0, USF sophomore forward Hasani Sinclair received a red card in the 54th minute. FGCU’s Ryan Price put in the first goal minutes later.


“Even after the red card and them being up a man, I felt like (USF) could come back …Can’t get too low when we lose, and too high when we win,” Kiefer said.


USF midfielder Kevin Olali scored for the Bulls.


The loss snaps USF’s 30-game home unbeaten streak.


“Wasn’t pleased with how they were moving the ball (during the first half),” Kiefer said.


The Bulls (0-1), ranked No. 13 in the country by College Soccer News, play Saturday at Saint Louis.
