USF hired Bob Shoop as its next defensive coordinator Monday. He had previously been working as an off-field defensive analyst for the University of Miami.


The decision to hire Shoop comes a few weeks after former defensive coordinator Glenn Spencer was fired Nov. 21.


Before working at Miami, Shoop had a long track record of working as defensive coordinator at multiple programs such as Yale, Villanova, William & Mary, Vanderbilt, Penn State, Tennessee and most recently Mississippi State in the 2018-19 season.


Shoop was twice named defensive coordinator of the year, in 2014 with Penn State and in 2018 with the Bulldogs. He was also a finalist for the 2018 Broyles Award, which is given annually to the best assistant coach in college football.


He also had head coaching experience when he held the position at Columbia University from 2003-05.


Shoop will be tasked with turning around a porous Bulls defense that surrendered 472.3 yards per game, worst in the AAC under Spencer. USF also allowed 34.7 points per game, second worst in the conference.
