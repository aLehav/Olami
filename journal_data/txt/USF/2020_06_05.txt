Following the BOG’s announcement Thursday, the university won’t be hosting its traditional on-campus commencement for summer and spring graduates. SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE


As a way to limit large gatherings, USF will host an online commencement ceremony for summer graduates after the Board of Governors (BOG) advised universities across the state Thursday to develop alternate plans for future ceremonies.


With an online commencement for summer graduates, the university won’t be hosting its traditional on-campus graduation ceremony scheduled in August. In an recent update, the university said the decision was made to promote the health and well-being of students, faculty, staff and attendees.


“We are deeply saddened that our graduates will not have the opportunity to experience the traditional celebration that comes with earning a college degree, an important milestone in their lives and for so many others who helped them along their journey,” according to the commencement update.


The online summer commencement will include speeches from Student Body President Claire Mitchell and other student leaders across all three campuses.


The ceremony times and details will be announced in the coming weeks, according to the update.


Besides summer graduates, spring graduates were also granted the option to attend the on-campus summer ceremony after the university hosted a virtual commencement May 9. In the email, the university extended the invitation to spring and summer graduates to take part in a future in-person ceremony.




“We also want to reaffirm our commitment to invite our spring 2020 and summer 2020 graduates to participate in a future traditional in-person commencement, as soon as those ceremonies can safely resume,” according to the update.
