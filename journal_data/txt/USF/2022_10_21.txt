Septemberâ€™s University Lecture Series (ULS), featuring actor Jai Rodriguez, was rescheduled for Nov. 3 after a monthlong delay due to Hurricane Ian, according to Center for Student Involvement (CSI) graduate assistant Hannah Sutherland.


The event was originally supposed to take place Sept. 29, but was canceled when the university shut down from Sept. 27 to Oct. 3 in anticipation of the storm, according to Associate Director of CSI Joshua Wilson.


Students will be able to attend the lecture, which begins at 8 p.m., in the Marshall Student Center Oval Theater, Sutherland said.


The delay will not impact the schedule of future ULS events, Sutherland said. The next lecture will still take place Nov. 15 as intended, where the theme will be LGBTQ pride. A speaker has yet to be announced.
