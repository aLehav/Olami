Sara Nevins’ outstanding career at USF ended last season, but she will get another chance to play for coach Ken Eriksen.


Nevins was the only member of the AAC to be selected for the USA Softball Women’s National Team on Sunday.  In her first experience with Team USA, Nevins helped win a silver medal at the 2013 World Cup along with a gold medal at the 2013 Mayor’s Cup and Pan Am Games Qualifier.


The team will prepare for the International Softball Federation Women’s World Championships by playing in exhibitions and three tournaments.


The Championships will take place Aug. 15-24 in Haarlem, Netherlands.


Twenty-four players tried out for the team this year, but there were only 17 roster spots for Eriksen’s assistants to choose.


The first tournament the team will compete in is the General Tire World Cup of Softball IX in Irvine, California from July 7-13.
