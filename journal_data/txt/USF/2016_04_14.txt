Veteran power forward Chris Perry has been dismissed from the USF men’s basketball team for violation of team rules, the school announced Thursday.


Perry, who just finished his junior season, becomes the second player to be dismissed in two weeks. Sophomore guard Roddy Peters was dismissed on March 30 for repeated violations.




“We have standards and expectations at USF and everyone will be held accountable to them,” USF coach Orlando Antigua said in a press release. “I appreciate Chris’ contributions to our program and wish him the best.”




Perry’s time at USF has been hampered by health issues. After a breakout freshman year – averaging 8.9 points and 5.3 rebounds – Perry missed the final 12 games of his sophomore year because of a problem with his left ventricle.


He returned to play in March 2015.


The 6-foot-11 forward was suspended for six games this past season.


He finished the season averaging 10.1 points and 6.6 rebounds.


Perry was one of three remaining players recruited by former coach Stan Heath, who was fired in March 2014. Only sophomores Bo Zeigler and Troy Holston
remain of the Heath era.
