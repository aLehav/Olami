The redshirt sophomore has three years of eligibility remaining after playing in 20 games for the Bulls over the last two seasons.


The decision comes after a season in which USF‚Äôs coaching staff struggled to select a consistent starting quarterback to go out and play each week. The Bulls also added two quarterbacks in the offseason, making an already packed position group even more crowded.


Aside from McCloud, the Bulls have Cade Fortin, Katravis Marsh, Jordan Smith, Jarren Williams and Timmy McClain all competing for the starting role.


In his time with USF, McCloud was 244-of-418 for 2770 yards, 21 passing touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also added 357 yards and five touchdowns on the ground.


The hometown quarterback from Tampa leaves the program on a high note as his latest performance against the UCF Knights on Nov. 11 was a career day. He posted 404 passing yards and five all-purpose touchdowns.
