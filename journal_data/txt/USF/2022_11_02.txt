An above-ground traffic sensor was installed at the intersection of Holly Drive and Genshaft Drive on Friday to provide better accuracy and traffic flow efficiency, according to Chris Fleischer, assistant director of utilities in Facilities Managementâ€™s Department of Maintenance and Utility Services.


These sensory systems placed throughout the Tampa campus will help traffic flow, according to Fleischer. They will replace in-ground detection loops moving forward.


The first sensor was installed eight years ago at the Holly Drive and Genshaft Drive intersection, according to Fleischer. More sensors have been placed at the intersections of Magnolia Drive and Holly Drive, Laurel Drive and Palm Drive as well as Alumni Drive and Genshaft Drive.


With more students than ever on campus, above-ground traffic sensors will improve traffic flow efficiency during peak and off peak periods, according to Director of Communication and Engagement Aaron Nichols.


The systems will likely be replaced about every 10 to 15 years, according to Fleischer.


The cost of the complete system is $22,000 and will be financed by operational funding or deferred maintenance, according to Fleischer. The addition of more sensors will be contingent on funding, Fleischer said, but he would like them placed at every intersection.
