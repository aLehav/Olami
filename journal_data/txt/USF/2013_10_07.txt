Finishing the game after over an hour-long power outage that occurred at the beginning of halftime, the USF Bulls (3-1-4, 1-0-1) shut out the California State University Bakersfield Roadrunners 3-0.



Not having a win at home since Sept. 2 against Stetson, and four draws in seven matches, the Bulls rallied back with a resounding win.



“It was shocking, but it was good to get the win,” said Coach George Kiefer.



After coming off a scoreless first period and the long delay, the ball was fed to freshman midfielder
Lindo

Mfeka
when he scored the first goal in the
47
th
minute of the game.



He scored another goal in the
81st
minute
of the match after bouncing the ball off the post, past the keeper, and into the goal.



Kiefer said
Mfeka
was just moved back to the middle position in the field, a location
Mfeka
said he’s played his whole life. He had previously been playing right wing for the team.



The third goal of the match was scored by senior defender Ben Sweat in the
85th
minute – his first goal of the season.


“The guys came out the second half with a very good mentality,” said Kiefer. “They have had so many delays that they kind of keep me loose at this point.”



Kiefer said he was pleased with the team’s approach coming off a match against No. 22 Connecticut in front of a crowd of over 1,800, and this could have been a letdown against a non-conference opponent.



The Bulls
outshot
the Roadrunners (2-5-1) 18-8 in the match.


USF’s next contest is their second conference match, Saturday, Oct. 5, against the Tigers (6-2-1) in Memphis, TN.
