After much speculation over the past week, USF football officially announced the hiring of Travis Trickett as its offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Friday.


Trickett will join coach Jeff Scott’s staff after having spent the last three seasons at West Virginia under coach Neal Brown, working with the inside receivers and tight ends. He also has seven years of experience as a coordinator between stints at Georgia State, FAU and Samford.


“I am very excited to welcome Travis back to Florida and to our USF Family,” Scott said in a statement. “His experience and expertise in several offenses and schemes that are similar to what we have previously run will make for a fluid transition for our players and staff and allow us to quickly build on the foundation we have laid.


“Travis comes from a football family and I look forward to adding his passion and sharp mind to our staff, and he will continue to elevate our quarterback play and maximize the potential of an offensive unit with 10 starters returning and some talented additions coming in.”


Trickett has a history of helping his offenses improve vastly.


While at Georgia State in 2017, he helped lead the Panthers to
multiple school records including fewest interceptions in a season (9), yards in a single game (670) and points against an FBS opponent (47).


At FAU in 2016, Trickett’s offense also broke several of the program’s single-season records such as rushing yards (2,519), yards per carry (4.8) and rushing touchdowns (31).
