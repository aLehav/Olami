After watching USF teammate Courtney Williams and 35 others hear their names called in Thursday’s draft, senior Alisia Jenkins is getting her shot in the WNBA.


The Georgia native, who averaged a double-double her final two seasons at USF, signed with the New York Liberty as an undrafted free agent, the school announced Monday.


Jenkins’ teammate Williams was selected eighth overall by the Phoenix Mercury.


Jenkins’ 6-foot-1 frame allowed her to dominate the paint for the Bulls and she’ll look to make the transition to the next level.


In her final two years, Jenkins began to step out of the paint and develop her game on a different level, developing a consistent mid-range jump shot and dabbled behind the 3-point line.


Jenkins left USF as the career leader in rebounds (1,284) and owns the only two 20-point, 20-rebound games in program history.


The Liberty begin preseason camp on Apr. 29 and kick off the 20th WNBA season on May 14 against the Washington Mystics.
