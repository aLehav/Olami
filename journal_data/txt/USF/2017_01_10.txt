With last night’s last-second heroics by Clemson’s Deshaun Watson to lift the Tigers over Alabama in the College Football Playoff National Championship, an authoritative stamp was put on the college football season.


Quickly following college football's biggest show came the final

AP rankings
of the season which saw USF finish 19th.It is the first time in program history that the Bulls finished the season ranked.


USF capped off the program’s first 11-win season with a 46-39 win over South Carolina in the Birmingham Bowl on Dec. 29.


USF was the lone AAC team remaining in the rankings with Houston, a once top-10 team, and AAC champion Temple not making the cut.


The Bulls were ranked ahead of five Power 5 schools including Miami, Louisville and Auburn, which all were ranked inside the top 10 at one point this season.
