The REC Fit Games will include events such as the 2,000-meter row, tire flips and sled pulls, ladder workouts, squat thrusters and overhead walking lunges. SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE


USF Recreation and Wellness is encouraging students to test their athletic abilities with a CrossFit-style competition this week.


The second annual REC Fit Games will be held
Nov. 2
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
at t
he Rec Softball Field
on USF Sycamore Drive.


The CrossFit-style competition
is
open to all USF students and USF Rec members and will have five different events.


Participants can register online for $10 if they are a student and $15 if they are a USF Rec member. Registration closes Oct. 31 at 12 p.m.


Part of the registration fee goes toward T-shirts for participants.


The workouts will include “a combination of endurance, strength and functional exercises,” according to the Recreation and Wellness website.


The games include a 2,000-meter row, tire flip and sled pull, ladder workouts, squat thrusters and overhead walking lunges.


Fitness coordinator for USF Recreation and Wellness Traci Smith said the REC Fit Games was an idea brought up by a previous staff member.


“Every semester we allow our program assistants or graduate assistants to create programs they want to offer to the USF community,” Smith said.


Last year there were 31 participants made up of 16 men and 15 women.


“We decided to mix up the events this year to allow variety from year to year,” Smith said.


There will be a men’s division and women’s division, with one winner from each.


“The [REC Fit Games] have become a tradition of our fitness department,” Smith said. “I would love to see [the number of participants] grow in the next couple of days.”
