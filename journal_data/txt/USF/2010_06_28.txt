OCEAN RIDGE â€“ U.S. Border Patrol authorities have taken 34 people, reportedly from Cuba, into custody after they came ashore on a beach in South Florida.


The immigrants arrived in Ocean Ridge, about 15 miles south of West Palm Beach, on a 28-foot boat early Sunday.


John Dair, a supervisory agent, says authorities saw a light on in an apartment and notified the occupants. Police were called to the scene, and all 34 people were taken into custody.


Under the U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act, most Cubans who reach U.S. soil are allowed to stay.


The immigrants included 16 adult men, 13 adult women and five children. They were being processed at immigration centers Sunday evening.
