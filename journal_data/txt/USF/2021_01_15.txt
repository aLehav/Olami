We’re ready to play a competitive schedule this spring and continue our streak of conference championships.”


This season will consist of eight conference games and two nonconference matches in the regular season, the Bulls will also have an additional exhibition game. USF will meet every opponent once and all matches are currently scheduled to take place on weekends.
