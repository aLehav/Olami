SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE




John Quinones, host of “What Would You Do?” on ABC News, is coming to campus on Oct. 26 as part of the University Lecture Series (ULS).


Quinones uses his show to challenge aspects of society by setting up different situations and placing hidden cameras to see how people react.  Some of his most recent situations include teens asking people to light a cigarette for them, parents having a negative reaction to their daughter’s interracial relationship and a shoplifting grandmother.


“As the ‘face of doing the right thing’ to millions of viewers, Quiñones embraces that role and will challenge audience members to examine pivotal ethical moments they face daily,” the press release said.


Quinones spent his teen years as a migrant farm worker before getting an education and joining ABC News — where he’s been for over 30 years — in a series of roles including as a news anchor for “20/20” and “Primetime.”


The lecture will be held in the Oval Theater at the Marshall Student Center. It is free and open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis with priority for students. Doors to the Oval Theater open at 7:30 p.m.
