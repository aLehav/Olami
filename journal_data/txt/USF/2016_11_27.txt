USF linebacker Cecil Cherry tweeted that he's transferring after a season in which he played in all 12 games and recorded 30 tackles. SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE




USF linebacker Cecil Cherry announced on Twitter that he’s leaving the school for a junior college on Sunday evening.


According to Brady Fredericksen of The Ledger, Cherry has known he was leaving USF for quite some time, but wanted to wait until the conclusion of the regular season to announce his decision.


Fredericksen reported that Cherry told him he would be transferring to Coahoma Community College because his playing time didn’t live up to what he said coaches told him he should expect in 2016.


The redshirt freshman transferred to USF in the fall of 2015 after spending just three practices with Texas and concluding that the team’s plans for him didn’t align with what he wanted.


Cherry played in all 12 games for USF in 2016 and recorded 30 tackles, the 13th-most on the team.
