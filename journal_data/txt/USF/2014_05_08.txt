Lee Ann
Spivey
hit a two-run homer in the third inning Thursday afternoon in Memphis, extending the
Bulls’lead
to five and sending the team to the semifinals. Though the Bulls didn’t score any more runs against the Tigers, they were able to cling to a 5-3 win over Memphis.


The Bulls recorded nine hits from four players, with conference rookie of the year freshman
Juli
Weber managing two hits and a run scored with an RBI.


Starting pitcher senior Sara
Nevins
was able to hold the Tigers to two runs over 5 1/3 innings. The two runs surrendered by
Nevins
came on one pitch to
Memphis’Ellen
Roberts. The
Tigers’senior
slammed the ball over the fence for a two-run home run.
Nevins
was relieved by sophomore Erica
Nunn
and together the two pitchers combined to give up five hits and strike out eight batters in the opening round of the American Athletic Conference (
AAC
) Tournament.


The second-seeded Bulls will play at 5 p.m. Friday against the third-seeded Louisville Cardinals (34-20) in Houston. The Cardinals knocked off Temple, 5-3, on Thursday. USF (41-14) will have a tough matchup Friday as they face a team that swept them in three games in regular season play this year.
