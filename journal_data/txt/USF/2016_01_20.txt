USF coach Willie Taggart has reportedly found his replacement for the open wide receivers coach position.


Fox Sports' Bruce Feldman reported Wednesday that Taggart has hired assistant T.J. Weist to replace former assistant Ron Dugans, who left to take the same position at the University of Miami earlier this month after two seasons with USF.


Weist most recently served as a senior offensive analyst for Michigan last season and was the receivers coach at Cincinnati during its two Big East titles in 2011-12.


The 50-year old veteran served as offensive assistant with Taggart for five years at Western Kentucky, which included the Hilltoppers’ 2002 Division I-AA national championship.


This hire comes shortly after Raymond Woodie was promoted to defensive coordinator following the departure of Tom Allen.
