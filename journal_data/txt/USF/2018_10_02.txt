The Student Government Supreme Court approved the on-campus stadium referendum in a unanimous decision Tuesday afternoon.


The referendum will ask students if they would be willing to pay a $6 to $9 per-credit-hour fee to help finance an on-campus football stadium.


The Court's approval allows the referendum to be placed on students’ midterm election ballots next week. Student can vote either “yes” or “no” on the referendum.


Midterm elections will take place Oct. 9 and 10.
