Indulge in the arts on the house

Betting big with Belushi


Spend a night at the Hard Rock Caf and Casino and make a bet or two. If betting is not your game then check out Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts band. Their show starts at 10 p.m. on Friday, with tickets available for $40 per person.


Get on those cowboy boots and take in a show


George Strait and Reba McEntire perform live at the St. Petersburg Times Forum Saturday. Strait and McEntire are considered to be among the greatest artists in the history of country music making it a must-see show for country music fans. The show starts at 7:30 p.m. and ticket prices range from $40-$90.


Catch a meal and a movie:


There is nothing wrong with partaking in a good ole’ fashioned dinner and a movie outing. Some of the latest films out are “The Dilemma,” starring Vince Vaughn and Kevin James or “No Strings Attached” with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher.
