USF President Judy Genshaft will be on annual leave until Oct. 15, leaving Provost Ralph Wilcox as acting president until then.


According to an email sent by Cynthia Visot, chief of staff, Genshaft began her annual leave on Monday and she has requested that all university business be directed to Wilcox. Genshaft, who last week announced her retirement, effective July 1, will be unavailable during this time.


University spokesman Adam Freeman wrote in an email to The Oracle that Genshaft will be traveling.


“She had a vacation originally planned for earlier this summer that she decided to reschedule for right after the announcement of her intentions to step down in July,” Freeman wrote.
