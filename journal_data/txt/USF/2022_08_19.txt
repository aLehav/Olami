The Sanford native entered the
transfer portal Monday
, soon after USF announced junior
Gerry Bohanon
as the starting quarterback.


McClain became the Bull’s starter quick in the 2021 season, taking over for former Bulls quarterback
Cade Fortin
.


Hours before McClain announced where he is headed, he tweeted that his recruiting process is closed.




I appreciate all the coaches from different levels for recruiting me and recognizing my talent.With that being said, I have made the decision to close down my recruiting process. Please respect my decision 🙏🏾

At a media availability after the USF Football Luncheon on Wednesday, coach Jeff Scott said McClain remained professional while at USF and that he has a “great future ahead of him.”


“I think it’s just the new reality of the kind of the environment that’s been created in college athletics,” he said. “Maybe some others that have been around coaching for a few years … remember those days where guys which stick around and keep battling.


“But really, I think the quarterback position is hard because there’s only one ball and when you get two guys together that are both starter capable, kind of guys. I mean, Timmy is a great young man. He’s gonna have a great future ahead of him. And he handled himself very well … while he was here, and we wish him nothing but the best.”


USF is expected to play UCF in its annual War-on-I-4 matchup on Nov. 26. This may be the last rivalry game in a while as UCF, Houston and Cincinnati are leaving the AAC in 2023 for the Big 12.
