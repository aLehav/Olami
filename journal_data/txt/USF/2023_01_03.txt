The search for a new provost has officially resumed after Interim Provost Eric Eisenberg announced his withdrawal from the race on Nov. 16, according to a Tuesday universitywide email from President Rhea Law.‚Å†


The search committee will remain unchanged, according to Law, with Chair John Ramil and Vice Chair Balaji Padmanabhan continuing to lead the effort.


Eisenberg assumed the role of interim provost Aug. 7 after former Provost Ralph Wilcox stepped down to spend more time with his family. Given his experience, Eisenberg was the leading contender in the previous search.


After the four finalists for the position spoke at their individual town halls, Law announced Eisenberg was asked to withdraw from the race and instead take on a newly created position in her cabinet as senior vice president of university-community partnerships.


Law said the search committee will begin reviewing applications and interviewing potential candidates soon, although no dates were provided.
