Following USF’s least attended game of the season, the school announced Thursday it would allow the first 300 student-driven vehicles to park for free in Lot 8 of Raymond James Stadium for its game against UConn on Saturday.


Lots open at 2:00 p.m. and each student vehicle must contain at least four passengers to qualify for the free parking. The lot for free student parking is located near the Student Government Tailgate and the Bulls Zone, which is adjacent to the sidewalk where the coaches and players walk by for the “Bulls Stampede” at 4:25 p.m.


Gates open at 5:30 p.m. and USF’s (5-1, 2-0) game with UConn (3-3, 1-2) is set to kick off at 7 p.m.
