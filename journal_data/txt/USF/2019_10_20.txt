Evelyne Viens has another record to her name, and she earned it on her senior day to boot.


Viens, who already held the USF women’s soccer record for most career goals, set the AAC record for most career goals when she scored her 62nd in the 25th minute of the Bulls’ 2-0 victory over Temple at Corbett Stadium on Sunday. The previous record was held by UConn’s Rachel Hill (2013-16).


The Bulls’ star striker set the program record for both single-season (20) and career goals last season in a year where she also set the program record for most points in a single season (47) and tied for most goals in the nation.


Viens’ game-winning goal Sunday came in the last regular-season home game for the Bulls

in which
she and four other seniors — including Andrea Hauksdottir, who scored on a penalty in the 71st minute — were honored before the game.


The outgoing senior class won the AAC regular-season championship last season, the 2017 AAC Tournament championship and has been ranked in at least one poll every week this season.
