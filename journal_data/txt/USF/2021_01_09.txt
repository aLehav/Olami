Adam Christian Johnson attended USF’s Sarasota-Manatee campus from spring 2015 through fall 2016, but he never earned a degree from USF. SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE/PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE


A Florida man and former USF student caught carrying Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during Wednesday’s mob in Washington D.C. was arrested Friday night and was being held at the Pinellas County Jail, according to arrest records.


Adam Christian Johnson, 36, was booked under a federal warrant, according to arrest records. His first appearance before a judge is scheduled for Monday, FBI spokesperson Andrea Aprea told the Tampa Bay Times.


Johnson was identified across the internet after posting a picture on Facebook next to Capitol Building signs stating “closed for all tours” with the caption “No.” His Facebook profile subsequently began circulating the internet where he identified himself as a former USF psychology student.


“There is an individual named Adam Christian Johnson of that age who attended the University of South Florida on the Sarasota-Manatee campus from spring 2015 through fall 2016,” said university spokesperson Adam Freeman in an email to The Oracle. “He majored in psychology, but did not earn a degree from the university.”


On Twitter, users began sharing Johnson’s personal information, including his date of birth and details about his family to aid the FBI investigation in finding those involved in Wednesday’s riots.


Johnson has five children and lives with his wife in Parrish, according to the Bradenton Herald.
