As men’s golf prepares for its fall season, coach Steve Bradley welcomed a new addition to the team on Monday.


Campbell Kennedy is the No. 5 ranked golfer in the state of Florida for the 2022 class and will join the roster this fall.


Kennedy has competed against a multitude of high-caliber golfers, finishing in the top 10 in three American Junior Golf Association events between 2021 and 2022. The Florida native is also ranked No. 74 in the country on the Junior Golf scoreboard, as well as No. 61 on the Rolex AJGA ranks.


In his high school career, Kennedy was elected both a member and a captain for the North Team at the 2021 FGSA Florida Cup, where he led the team to a championship.


He also won the Florida Junior Tour in 2021 and made 13 top 25 finishes along with eight top 10 finishes that same year.


With the addition of Kennedy along with previously committed player Nino Palmquist, who is ranked No. 3 in the Swedish Under-18 Golf rankings, the team has recruited a strong 2022 class.


The men’s golf team plans to utilize the incomers and hopefully build them to the level of other golfers like junior Albin Bergstrom, who has contributed to USF’s success since his arrival and was named 2022 AAC Golfer of the Year.
