Less than a week after being appointed as head football coach, Willie Taggart announced initial coaching staff changes Thursday.


While members of the former staff, including assistant coach Kevin Patrick, offensive coordinator Todd Fitch and defensive coordinator Chris Cosh, were let go, one member of the former staff was retained former running backs coach Larry Scott.


Scott has been tapped to serve as offensive assistant, while Taggart announced that Raymond Woodie, who coached with Taggart at Western Kentucky, would join as defensive assistant. Both Woodie and Scott are seen as strong recruiters something Taggart said he will prioritize in the coming seasons.


Since being officially announced as coach on Saturday, Taggart has received three commitments from Fort Lauderdale quarterback Mike White and El Dorado, Kan. defensive players Torrel Saffold and Rahmon Swain.
