USF women’s basketball once again reached new heights in the AP Top 25 Poll when it checked in at No. 13 this week.


This ranking is now the highest in program history, surpassing last week’s high of No. 14.


The Bulls were able to move up one spot without playing a single game since the last rankings were released. Games against Wichita State and Memphis on Jan. 20 and Jan. 23, respectively, were postponed due to
COVID-19-related
issues.


USF is currently 10-1 overall and holds an undefeated 7-0 record against AAC opponents.


The Bulls are set to play Temple at home Wednesday at 4 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN+ and broadcast on 95.3/620 WDAE iHeartRadio Bulls Unlimited.
