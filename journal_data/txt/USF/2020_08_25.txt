The AAC announced Tuesday that all soccer and volleyball competitions and conference championships will be postponed until the spring of 2021.


The news follows the
NCAA’s ruling that moved Division I championships to the spring
, which was the primary reason behind the conference’s decision.


“We were prepared to conduct competition in the fall in men’s and women’s soccer and women’s volleyball, but moving to the spring was in the best interest of our student-athletes as it will align our schedules to allow our teams to compete for national championships,” Conference Commissioner Mike Aresco said in a statement.


USF Vice President of Athletics Michael Kelly reacted to the news via Twitter.


“I know this news is difficult and disappointing to the many student-athletes and coaches who were preparing mentally and physically to compete this fall and were excited for that opportunity,” he wrote. “My heart aches for them. However, I know our Bulls are resilient.”

The conference will announce the regular season and championship schedules “after the NCAA Division I  Council clarifies the revised playing and practice season and championship formats.”


A decision regarding cross country competitions has yet to be made.
