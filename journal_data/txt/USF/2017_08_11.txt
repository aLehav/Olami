After over 50 years on air, the WUSF-TV station was sold and is getting ready to shut down Oct. 15.
SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE




WUSF-TV will officially be going dark Oct. 15.


The official date was announced Friday by Alisa Carmichael, executive administrative specialist with the station.


After 50 years of broadcasting, it was announced in February that the station would be sold in the Federal Communications Commission spectrum auction for $18.7 million.


In February, university spokeswoman Lara Wade said sale was because the station didn’t “align with our resources and mission and vision. The broadcast TV license was not part of our education mission to continue student success.”


Some of the programming will continue at
WEDU.org
, according to Carmichael.


This does not impact radio stations such as WUSF 89.7, the local NPR station, Classical WSMR 89.1 and 103.9.


The space the studio occupies was one source of discussion when the idea of selling came about. The Board of Trustees discussed in October 2015 the possibility of renting it to a local station.


However, according to Carmichael’s email, the film studios will be used for video production projects and serve as a learning environment for students guided by WUSF professionals.
