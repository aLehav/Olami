Quinton Flowers, who is widely recognized as the best quarterback in program history, is one of three former Bulls set to be inducted into the USF Athletic Hall of Fame on Sept. 30 at a 6 p.m. ceremony at TPepin’s Hospitality Centre.


The Class of 2022 includes Flowers, volleyball star Erica Berggren and former Director of Athletics Paul Griffin, bringing the total number of members in the hall to 31. It is also the third class to be inducted since 2013.


“The tradition and legacy of USF Athletics continues to swell as we proudly welcome members of the 2022 Hall of Fame Class that have left truly memorable and transformational marks on USF Athletics,” Vice President of Athletics Michael Kelly said in a Thursday press release.


This year’s class, which will be honored during USF football’s Oct. 1 game against ECU, is headlined by Flowers, who is the fourth football player to ever be inducted. He was quarterback from 2014-17, leading the Bulls to three consecutive bowl games, two of which they won.


Flowers also holds a number of USF records, including a program-record-tying 30 wins as starting quarterback. He is also the all-time leading rusher in program history, with 3,672 yards.


Berggren will be the second volleyball player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. The former middle blocker played from 1993-96 and earned four first-team all-conference selections and helped lead USF to a 105-26 record.


The Bulls made it to three conference championships with Berggren, winning in her last two seasons. She also holds a few records, leading USF in hitting percentage (.415), total blocks (626) and block assists (488).


Griffin will be the third director of athletics to be inducted. He served in that position for 15 years, from 1986-2001. During his time, he saw the addition of a women’s soccer team in 1995 and football team in 1997.


Some of his most notable hires were Lee Roy Selmon as associate athletic director for external affairs and former USF baseball player Ken Eriksen to join the softball staff and eventually become head coach.


He also promoted then-assistant women’s basketball coach Jose Fernandez to interim head coach in 2000. Fernandez just finished his 22nd season as coach and has been to the NCAA Tournament eight times. He helped USF win its first conference title in 2021.
