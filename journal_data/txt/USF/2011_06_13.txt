HOUSTON – An aide to U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords said Saturday that she could be released from a rehabilitation hospital in Houston as early as this month, offering the latest indication that the Arizona congresswoman is making progress in recovering from a gunshot wound to the head.


Chief of Staff Pia Carusone told The Associated Press that doctors and family are considering “many factors” while making the critical next-step decision to release Giffords from TIRR Memorial Hermann, the hospital where she has been undergoing intensive daily rehabilitation since late January.


“We’re looking at before the end of the month. We’re looking at early July,” Carusone said. “We don’t have a date.”
