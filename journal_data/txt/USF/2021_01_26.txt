Both the men’s and women’s basketball teams had their schedules altered Tuesday morning.


The men’s team had a previously postponed game against No. 6 Houston rescheduled to Feb. 10, and a future game against Tulane was moved from Feb. 13 to Feb. 14.


Tipoff times and network designations for both games will be announced at a later date.


Barring any other issues, the men are scheduled to return to the court Feb. 3 to take on Tulsa.


As for the women’s team, the next two games on the schedule versus Temple on Wednesday and Cincinnati on Saturday have been postponed.


A positive COVID-19 case and the ensuing contact tracing within the USF program resulted in the postponements.


No decision has been made about dates or times for the games to be rescheduled.


Assuming no other issues arise, the women’s team is set to return Feb. 7 in a noon matchup against UCF.
