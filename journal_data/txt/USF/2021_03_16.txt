Brown is the second player to transfer from the Bulls this offseason, as senior guard David Collins also entered the portal earlier in the week.


Collins and Brown have the ability to transfer after playing four seasons due to the
NCAAâ€™s decision that this season would not count toward a year of eligibility for winter sport student-athletes, meaning they have an additional year of eligibility left to use.


Over four seasons with the Bulls, Brown averaged 7.7 points and 3.5 rebounds per contest over 123 games, and 84 starts. Brown served as a dependable three-point shooter with the ability to heat up quickly as his collegiate career three-point percentage thus far stands at 34.5% on 4.5 attempts per game.


Of the three players who participated in Senior Night on March 2 â€” Brown, Collins and redshirt junior forward Alexis Yetna â€” only Yetna remains on the team.


The departure of two key veterans that helped the USF menâ€™s basketball program get back on track could signal a new era of Bulls basketball, as coach Brian Gregory may look to hand the keys of the team over to some of the younger players such as freshman guard Caleb Murphy and sophomore guard Jamir Chaplin.
