A student filed a battery complaint with University Police (UP) on Monday morning after being pepper-sprayed Sunday
evening in a residence hall.
“Three friends were monkeying around and one of them was sprayed with pepper spray,” UP spokesman Lt. Chris Daniel said.
According to Daniel, the student who was pepper-sprayed was done so after a “request for prostitution.”
The victim of that request has been referred to the State Attorney’s Office and if a charge is filed, UP will no longer be involved in the investigation.
Daniel said UP is waiting to hear what comes of the investigation into the request for prostitution.
