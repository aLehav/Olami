Though the regular season hasn’t started yet, USF coach Denise Schilte-Brown has noticed good team chemistry of late.


As evidenced by their pair of 2-0 exhibition game wins – USF only scored two goals in a game once last year – the youth is maturing quickly, Schilte-Brown said.


“Upperclassmen have been mentoring young players and the team seems to be meshing quickly,” she said.


Led by seniors Mallori-Lofton Malachi and Amanda McCormick, the Bulls only have a total of eight upperclassmen on their 34-player roster. That youth will be put to the test when USF hosts FAU (0-1-0) this Friday at 7:30 p.m. in its regular season opener, followed by a trip to Gainesville where they’ll take on No. 10 Florida on Sunday at 1 p.m. USF beat FAU 1-0 last year in overtime and leads the all-time series 7-4-2


USF has faced Florida twice in its 14 year history, losing 4-0 in 2007 and 5-0 in 2000. Florida finished last season with an 11-0 SEC record.


The Gators opened the season with a 1-0 win against Miami.


Schilte-Brown said she doesn’t even want to think about the Gators right now.


“We’re taking it one game at a time,” said Schilte-Brown. “We’re not even thinking about (Florida) until after FAU. Even though we’re excited to play the game, we can’t get ahead of ourselves.”
