The USF women’s basketball team is set to compete in the first-ever women’s Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas next season.


The tournament will take place Nov. 20-22 and will be held at the Paradise Island resort. It was originally scheduled to be played in 2020 but due to COVID-19 complications it was postponed a year.


Twelve teams are expected to make up the field including Oregon, South Carolina, Syracuse, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Buffalo and former AAC rival UConn. The rest of the teams are still to be announced.


Coach Jose Fernandez has always prided himself on putting his team through grueling nonconference schedules to start the season. Next year looks to be no different as six of the teams slated to play in the Battle 4 Atlantis also competed in the NCAA tournament.
