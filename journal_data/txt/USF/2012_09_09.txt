Gay marriage and delicious chicken sandwiches are not political statements.


I strongly believe no government, person or food chain should tell us what to believe in or who to love – hence why they are called opinions. I believe that gay marriage is simply an issue on just that: opinions.


When I read in Wednesday’s edition of
The Oracle
about a petition trying to remove
Chick-fil-A
from campus, I was shocked not only for the fact that a business is being punished for its opinion, but also because a school takes pride in being progressive is taking a stand against a business with a harmless opinion. The
Chick-fil-A
company is not asking if any customer is gay, nor are they shunning or refusing service to anyone based on sexual orientation.


Hearts are saddened every Sunday when
Chick-fil-A
stores are closed, but Americans never began protesting this business’ right to observe its religious beliefs then, so why begin now? Will banning the restaurant on our campus do anything but remove delicious and graciously cheap food from our grasp? I believe it is worth agreeing to disagree on this issue for the sake of allowing amazingly delicious chicken sandwiches to reach any USF student, no matter their sexual orientation.
