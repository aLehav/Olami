With the arrival of Amir Abdur-Rahim, the new men‚Äôs basketball head coach brings some of his own Kennesaw State talent to USF.


Junior guards Chris Youngblood, Kasen Jennings and Brandon Stroud announced they were transferring from Kennesaw State to USF on April 1, three days after Abdur-Rahim was named USF‚Äôs new coach. Abdur-Rahim coached four seasons with the Owls from 2018-19 to 2022-23.


Alongside Abdur-Rahim, the trio contributed to the Owls winning a program-best 26 games, an ASUN conference title and the school‚Äôs first NCAA tournament appearance last year.


As USF undergoes a rebuild, Youngblood, Jennings and Stroud will provide needed stability to the group.

The 6-foot 6-inch guard led the Owls in rebounds at 6.5 per game while also contributing 9.2 points per game.


Stroud‚Äôs field goal shooting also took a big jump at 44.5%, nearly six percentage points higher than the season prior.


Kasen Jennings


While coming off the bench, junior guard Kasen Jennings proved to be crucial to the Owls‚Äô success.


Jennings went from starting just one game in 2021-2022 to starting 18 the next season. He scored 6.2 points per contest while shooting 41% from the field and 37.8% from the three.


Kasean Pryor




Northwest Florida State sophomore forward Kasean Pryor committed to USF on Monday. During his decision process, he turned down offers from NC State, St. John‚Äôs and New Mexico among other programs.


In 35 games last year, Pryor averaged 14.8 points and 8.0 rebounds per game while shooting 46% from the field. Standing at 6 feet 10 inches, he boasts size and an ability to space the floor, making 35% of his threes during the 2022-2023 season.


Pryor was one of the premier junior college players in all of basketball and was named an NJCA first-team All-American.

In 2022-23 with the Ospreys, Placer averaged 14.0 points per game and scored a career-high 32 points against Lipscomb on Feb. 16. He also shot 41% from the field and 36% from the three.

Junior center Russel Tchewa announced he was entering the transfer portal on April 3. He spent three seasons with the Bulls after transferring from Texas Tech in 2020.

After completing his final year of eligibility, guard Tyler Harris declared for the NBA draft on April 12.
