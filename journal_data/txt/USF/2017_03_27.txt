USF football player Hassan Childs was arrested Monday morning for his involvement in what was described as a road rage shooting, according to Tampa Police.


Childs, 22, was charged with three counts of aggravated assault and one count of possession of less than 20 grams of cannabis after Tampa Police concluded its investigation Monday.


On Saturday night at 11:15, Childs was reportedly tailing Jovanni Jimenez, 26, and his wife and 3-year-old child in his Chevy Malibu. According to the police report, Jimenez pulled over multiple times to let Childs pass, but was met with a gun pointed at him from Childs’ vehicle both times.


The second time Jimenez pulled over, he fired his own gun and struck Childs three times in the torso, upper right arm and beneath his arm.


Jimenez then drove home to his apartment and called 9-1-1 to report the incident.


After being taken into custody at a local hospital, Childs is still being treated for his injuries and remains in stable condition, according to Tampa Police.


Both Jimenez and Childs own concealed weapon permits, and a loaded firearm was recovered from Childs’ vehicle.


According to Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office records, Jimenez was charged, but not prosecuted, for misdemeanor domestic violence two years ago. Jimenez also pled no-contest after an arrest in February 2012 for misdemeanor charges of opposing an officer without violence.


Childs has no prior criminal record in Florida.
