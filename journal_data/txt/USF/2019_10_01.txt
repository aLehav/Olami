The Health and Wellness unit of Student Success has new shoes to fill as it was announced that the current associate vice president, Rita DeBate, will step down from her position.


As associate vice president of Health and Wellness, DeBate oversaw departments such as Campus Recreation, Student Health Services, the Counseling Center, the Center for Student Well-Being, Victim Advocacy and Student Outreach and Support.


These departments provide initiatives and programs such as the Wellness Centers in the Marshall Student Center and the FIT, free flu shots for students, fitness classes in Campus Recreation and mental health services.


DeBate is stepping down to “devote more of her time to research, scholarship and teaching,” according to an email Vice President for Student Success Paul Dosal sent to the Student Success team Sept. 27.


She will be returning to public health after three years in the role, though she will still be active in Student Success initiatives as she will be the co-director of the Center for Student Success and Well-Being.


DeBate could not be reached for comment.


Tom Miller, the former vice president of Student Affairs, will step into the role of interim vice president of Health and Wellness.


Miller was the dean of students when he was hired at USF in 2001 and is currently an associate professor in the college of education.


“Tom brings unquestioned credentials into the position,” Dosal said. “He will provide valuable leadership, vision and stability to the Health and Wellness unit.”
