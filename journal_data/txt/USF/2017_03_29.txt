SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE




Nearly half of the 20 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed each year are found in those age 15-24, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).


Student Health Services (SHS) and the Center for Student Well-Being are partnering to offer students free testing for STIs with the annual “Get Yourself Tested” event.


Testing includes gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, hepatitis and HIV. Usually these tests cost up to several hundred dollars, although some organizations like Planned Parenthood offer discounted rates.


The CDC recommends getting tested for chlamydia every year if sexually active as it can affect a woman’s ability to have children if left untreated.


The testing will be offered at the Student Health Services Annex from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. today and usually takes between 60 and 90 minutes with results coming within three weeks.
