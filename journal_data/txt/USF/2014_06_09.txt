Victor Rudd is determined to
make an NBA roster. In preparation
for the NBA Draft on
June 26, the former USF forward
has been working tirelessly in
the gym and at team workouts
to impress talent evaluators
enough to garner a contract.


Danny Ainge, the president
of basketball operations for the
Boston Celtics, saw Rudd perform
at his pro day and was
impressed enough to offer him
a workout.


Last week, Rudd worked out
for the Milwaukee Bucks and the
Celtics. He said both teams gave
him positive feedback, but he
thinks the Celtics were particularly
pleased with his workout.


“The Celtics liked me for being
physical,” Rudd said. “They said
I was the most physical guy in
the workout.”


Such a compliment is high
praise for a workout that included
Adreian Payne, who is projected
as a first round draft pick
and led the Spartans to the Elite
Eight. Michael Dixon of Missouri
was also present at the workout,
along with a player from Oregon
State and a player from France.


Rudd, who has the 10th most
points scored in USF history,
said the workout consisted of
shooting drills and a game of
three on three, which is where
he said he made his impression
on the Celtics.


Rudd fully expects to be
signed to a team for the upcoming
season, whether it’s with
the professional team or their
D-League affiliate team. But
according to Rudd, he might not
have to worry about finding a
team to sign with after the draft.


“There’s a couple of teams
that are interested in drafting
me,” Rudd said. “But if they
don’t, I still have the summer
league games and that’s where
I’m going to show people what I
really can do.”


With his sights set on the
NBA, Rudd has been training on
the court and in the gym every
day. Rudd said he spends six to
seven hours a day working on
conditioning, lifting and shooting.
He has also been practicing
with NBA players DeMarcus
Cousins and Nick Young, as well
as former NBA guard Gilbert
Arenas.


Rudd said he hopes to play
for a team that is already established,
such as the Spurs or
the Thunder, but he thinks his
familiarity with the Celtics team
would make them a good option.


“I played high school basketball
with Avery Bradley and
I know Jared Sullinger, so they
would be a good fit,” Rudd said.


There are still many more
teams Rudd has to try out for
before the draft. Next on the
schedule are workouts for the Mavericks,
the Rockets and the
Pistons.
