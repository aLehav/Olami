With National Signing Day approaching on Feb. 5, time is of essence for college football coaches across the country, who are trying to secure commitments from the best student athletes yet to decide on a college.



However, USF coach Willie Taggart and his staff appear to have a jump on the competition, at least when it comes to quantity.



The Bulls have 24 commitments currently, tied for third in the American Athletic Conference (
AAC
), according to ESPN.com.



Houston (27) and Cincinnati (26) are ahead of USF, but neither have a four or five-star commit according to ESPN’s rating system, while the Bulls have four four-star commits, the most in the
AAC
.



Four-star players leading the class for the Bulls as of now are defensive end Eric
Mayes
, receiver
Ryeshene
Bronson, offensive lineman Benjamin Knox and athlete Jimmy
Bayes
, all from Florida.
