Despite a tough loss in the first round of the Big East Tournament in South Bend, Ind., USF pitcher Sara Nevins has reason to celebrate. The sophomore was named as one of the top 11 finalists for the USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year award.


Nevins is one of four pitchers still in the running for the award, and her 1.05 ERA, which is fifth in the nation, is the best among the finalists. The icing on the top of Nevins impressive cake of a season was her three no-hitters, including back-to-back no-hitters  one of which was a perfect game  on March 10 and 11.


There are 320 Division I teams  thats a lot of players on each team, said Head Coach Ken Eriksen. And for Sara to get recognized by the national
governing body, I think says a lot about what she has done this year against the schedule she has played.
