SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE




What does an ant whisperer, the student body vice president, a hula hooper and the dean of engineering have in common? They’ll all be sharing the same stage this weekend to give a TED talk.


TED is a global phenomenon meant to bring together some of the world’s brightest minds to share their ideas, hopes and dreams.


Since there are a million more ideas worth sharing, TEDx was created to bring local communities together to listen to their dreamers next door.


USF will host a TEDx event Saturday at the School of Music that will give the stage to the university’s professors and students who have something to say.


Speakers include:


—
Rhondel Whyte
, the student body vice president, who left Trinidad and arrived in this country hoping he may also achieve the American dream.


—
Jill McCracken
, a professor of rhetoric, who studies sex trafficking and violence against girls and women.


—
Parmvir Bahia
, a research associate and neuroscientist, who believes science can be brought to everyday people by reducing the gap between scientists and non-scientists.


—
Daniel H. Yeh
, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, who focuses on global health and thinks the problems of water, energy, food and sanitation can solved by biorecycling.


—
Jonathon Burroughs
, a sophomore majoring in health science, who appreciates the greatness of nature and advocates living modestly.


—
Carissa Caricato
, a graduate with a degree in mass communications, who sends hula-hoops to girls around the world and believes simple joys can make a world of difference in the lives of the downtrodden.


—
Robert Bishop
, the dean of engineering, who grew up surrounded by creativity and believes art and engineering go hand in hand.


—
Deby Cassill
, a professor at USF St. Petersburg, who claims to be an ant whisperer and wants to share the rich, inner lives of fire ants.


—
Ryan Swanson
, a graduate with a degree in architecture, who funded an event to improve urban areas under the theory that creativity can bring together urban communities.


—
Gloria Munoz
, a graduate with a degree in creative writing, who is part of an alumni team that focuses on collaborative art projects for a cause.


While tickets are no longer available for the 100 seats in Barness Recital Hall, the first 100 people in line Saturday morning will get to watch a live streaming at another room in the School of Music.


For those who aren’t able to get a seat, there will be other streaming parties hosted by student organizations and resident halls.


The first lecture starts at 10 a.m. and the event is expected to run until 4 p.m.
