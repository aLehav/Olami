Washington was recently named the receivers coach and passing game coordinator for Western Kentucky in January, but has now left to join the Bulls‚Äô (1-11, 0-8 AAC) staff. He also held the same role at Oklahoma during the 2022 season.


The news of Washington‚Äôs hiring comes after reports on Tuesday that former wideout coach Matthew Middleton left to take the same job at Kansas State. Middleton was hired a month before his departure.


With the Sooners (6-7, 3-6 Big 12), Washington sustained an offense that averaged 32.9 points per game. His top receiver, Marvin Mimms, totaled 54 receptions, 1,083 receiving yards and six touchdowns last year. Mimms also hovered around 20 yards per reception which was sixth in the nation.


Before his time with OU, Washington was the wide receiver coach at Southern University during the 2021 season. He also served as director of player development at his alma mater Missouri in 2020.


In addition to his experience as a coach, Washington also played the wideout position professionally. He signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2014 and played for seven different NFL teams from 2014-2015. He closed his professional career with stints in the CFL and AAF, as well as the XFL‚Äôs St. Louis Battlehawks.
