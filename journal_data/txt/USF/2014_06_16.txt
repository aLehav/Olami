After coaching the Bulls for four seasons, golf coach Chris Malloy is leaving USF for his alma mater, the University of Mississippi.


In his time with the Bulls, Malloy was the 2013 Big East Coach of the Year and coached two Conference Players of the Year.


These players, Brooks and Chase Koepka, have experienced their share of success lately.


Chase was recently named one of the 157 All-Region players for the 2014 season. His older brother, Brooks, finished the U.S. Open this past weekend tied for fourth place.


Malloy will replace Ernest Ross, who coached at Ole Miss for 16 seasons. This past year, the team finished last in the SEC Championship.
