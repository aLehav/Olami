Coming into the Tallahassee Regional with a strong pitching circle and explosive offense, the Bulls took Mississippi State 4-0.


The Bulldogs (33-25) headed into the matchup sporting the regional second seed, but weren’t on the dominant high that the Bulls (45-14) left off on.


Not only did USF have a successful regular season, but was just one game shy of an AAC championship after facing Central Florida, which is now hosting its own regional.


To start off their first game strong, the Bulls brought senior pitcher Georgina Corrick into the circle to take control of the game.


With Corrick tallying nine strikeouts in her seven-inning outing and not allowing any Bulldogs to reach home, the pitcher made it easy for the South Florida offense to do their job without the worry of Mississippi trailing behind.


The Bulls tallied their first run early in the first with junior outfielder Alexis Johns reaching home after redshirt sophomore outfielder Meghan Sheehan was caught stealing second.


South Florida’s bats remained quiet up until the sixth when the offense picked up its momentum once again.


Sheehan kicked off the inning with a solo home run to extend the lead to 2-0, but the powerful hits didn’t stop there. Shortly after, sophomore catcher Josie Foreman hit a two-run shot to left field to put on some insurance for USF, making the score 4-0.


With a dominant start to what will be a competitive NCAA Regional, the Bulls will continue to ride the wave they began on Saturday against No. 2 Florida State.


The Bulls will play Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Tallahassee. The game will be broadcast on ESPN+.
