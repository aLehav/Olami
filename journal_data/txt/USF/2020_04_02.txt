Dining Services said partial credits to meal plan holders will appear on each student’s OASIS account by April 10. SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE


Over a week has passed since USF Housing and Residential Education announced it would be issuing refunds on dorms, leaving students to question the future of their meal plan funds.


On Wednesday, however, over 7,000 students with meal plans finally got answers.


Dining Services said it would be giving partial credits to meal plan holders due to COVID-19, according to an email sent last night. A refund will be issued based on the number of unused meals, from March 23 through May 8, as well as unused dining dollars.


For the students who have decided to stay on campus, their meal plans will remain active.


The refund will appear as a credit on each student’s OASIS account by April 10. Before being deposited as a refund, the credits will be used to fulfill any fees the students may have.


“It is important to note that the amount of any credit will first be used to reduce any existing balance in the student’s OASIS account, with any remaining credit refunded to the student,” Dining Services wrote in the email.


Following Juniper Dining’s closure on March 29, The Hub will be the only dining hall that will remain open for to-go options through the remainder of the semester for meal plan holders.


With summer A, B and C being online, it is still unknown whether USF will offer meal plans continuing into the next semester.
