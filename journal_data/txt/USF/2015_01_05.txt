Florida is bringing in the New
Year with a sigh of relief for
many same-sex couples as it lifts
its ban on gay marriage today
and joins 35 other states to have
legalized it.


This step represents major
progress as it brings the U.S.
closer to full marriage equality.
Not only did a majority of states
come to legalize same-sex marriage
in 2014, but the possibility
is still open for several others as
the matter is under court review.
However, despite the progress
seen last year and today, the U.S.
is still lagging in consistency, as
there is much left to be done to
reach full equality.


For instance, the initial ruling
to lift the ban on gay marriage in
Florida would have only impacted
one county.


Although U.S. District Judge
Robert Hinkle ruled Florida’s
ban on gay marriage unconstitutional
last August, the ruling
was specifically effective in
Washington County, located in
the Panhandle, as reported by
CBS Miami. In Florida’s 67 other
counties, clerks were not necessarily
required to grant marriage
licenses to same-sex couples.


On New Year’s Day, Hinkle
clarified his ruling and declared
clerks must issue marriage
licenses under the Constitution
and even threatened that those
who don’t could face lawsuits.
His necessary statements no longer
leaves rights for same-sex
couples up in the air within the
same state.


The country already has
enough of this, as the same issue
prevails on a larger scale: 10
states outright ban same-sex
marriage while a majority of
them allow it.


Though the number of states
with bans is significantly smaller
than the number without, all
same-sex couples deserve the
right to marry regardless of
where they live.


In a country where anyone
can get married including Kim
Kardashian, and her notorious
72-day marriage to Kris
Humphries in 2011, as well as
Britney Spears’ 55-hour marriage
in 2004, it is unfathomable
that happy same-sex couples are
denied marriage by critics who
can support a “traditional marriage”
yet gawk at shows like
“90 Day Fiance,” which was
TLC’s highest-rated new show
in 2014 and details the lives of
six couples as they are pressured
into making a choice to marry
within 90 days before their visas
expire.


By the end of 2015, the U.S.
needs to have closed in on this
inconsistency among states. The
option to marry should be available
to everyone all over the
country.


This week may reveal whether
or not the U.S. Supreme Court
will address marriage equality
in the country, as five appeals
will be presented to the justices
during a conference set for Jan.
9, according to Bloomberg. If
the court decides to pick up this
issue, a ruling could be due in
June.


While this ruling would take
the matter out of the states’
hands, it could firmly establish
marriage rights that are currently
on shaky grounds.


For instance, as reported last
November in the Supreme Court
of the United States Blog, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit established same-sex
marriage bans in Kentucky,
Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee
and overturned the lower-court
rulings within those states.


While marriage equality has
met great strides today in Florida
and throughout the country, a
Supreme Court ruling could put
an end to the uncertainty and
inconsistency that still plagues
the right for same-sex couples to
marry, as seen with the current
bans. The right to marry is gaining
more and more legal visibility
within the states, but this year
the legalization of same-sex marriage
should finally fully encompass
the U.S. without question.
