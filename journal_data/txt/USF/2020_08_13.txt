A trip to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium appears to be off the books for USF football this season.


After
the Big 12 adopted an adjusted schedule of nine conference games and one nonconference game
, Texas has updated its schedule, and USF isnâ€™t on it. The Longhorns have opted to play in-state rival Texas El Paso as their season opener and only non-league opponent.

The Bullsâ€™ season is now set to kick off against Willie Taggert and Florida Atlantic on Sept. 26 at FAU Stadium, but USFâ€™s schedule is missing three opponents.


The Bullsâ€™ home opener against Bethune-Cookman was canceled after the MEAC in canceled all fall sports. The Mountain West had originally moved back its season start date to Sept. 26 but subsequently postponed its season, which meant USFâ€™s game against Nevada on Sept. 19 was scrapped.


The AAC is planning on having a season, but the conference is waiting for more information before making a decision.
