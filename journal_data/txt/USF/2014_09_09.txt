Three players on the USF men’s soccer team earned AAC honors last week after the Bulls won two games.

Senior midfielder Lucas Baldin was named the AAC Offensive Player of the Week, scoring three goals in two games. He made both goals in a 2-1 victory over No. 24 Akron last week. Baldin leads the team in shots on goal (9) and goals (3).

Junior goalkeeper Spasoje Stefanovic was named the AAC Goalkeeper of the Week. Stefanovic made four saves this week, during which he shut out Portland. The only goal Stefanovic gave up this past week was on a penalty kick against Akron.

Senior defender Wesley Charpie was named to the AAC honor roll this week due to his efforts against Akron and Portland. In both games, the USF defense didn’t surrender a single goal.

USF and its award-winning players will take to the road this weekend when they travel to play Old Dominion on Friday.
