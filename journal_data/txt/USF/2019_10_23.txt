In a new study by WalletHub, a personal finance website, USF was ranked No. 4 for “2020’s Best Colleges & Universities in Florida” and No. 117 in the nation.


The results may come as a surprise to some after
U.S. News & World Report’s ranking for the top public university in the nation rated USF at No. 44, ahead of its geographically closest competitor, UCF.


In the WalletHub study, however, UCF ranked No. 3 in Florida and No. 97 in the nation, just ahead of USF. UF was ranked first in the state and 32nd in the nation. FSU was No. 2 in the state and 43rd nationally.


To determine the results, the top-performing schools across the country with the lowest tuition rates for undergraduates were taken into consideration during the study.
