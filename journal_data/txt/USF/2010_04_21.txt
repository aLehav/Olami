LOS ANGELES â€“ A Mexican citizen is suing the Roman Catholic cardinals of Mexico City and Los Angeles over allegations they shuffled a Mexican pedophile priest between countries in the late 1980s.


Judges have thrown out two previous lawsuits, saying a Mexican citizen cannot sue another Mexican citizen in U.S. court.


An L.A. archdiocese spokesman denies any wrongdoing by Cardinal Roger Mahony.
