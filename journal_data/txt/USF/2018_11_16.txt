SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE/GOUSFBULLS






USF women’s basketball announced Friday senior Kitija Laksa will miss the remainder of the 2018-19 season due to a knee injury sustained during the third quarter of
Thursday’s victory against Bethune-Cookman
at the Yuengling Center.


An MRI on Friday morning revealed that Laksa, a preseason All-American candidate, suffered a torn ACL and meniscus.


“This is obviously a very difficult blow for Kitija, who is one of the top players in the nation, and our team,” coach Jose Fernandez said in a statement. “I know with Kitija’s will and determination, she will get through this and be back on the floor as a top-level player.”


Through three games this season, Laksa led all USF scorers with 16.3 points per game. She led the Bulls in scoring each of the past two seasons with 717 points in 2017-18 and 634 points in 2016-17.


According to USF Athletics staff, there has not yet been a decision on whether Laksa will declare a medical redshirt.
