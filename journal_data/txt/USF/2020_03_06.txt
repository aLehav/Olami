With spring break less than two weeks away, USF
World
announced that all study abroad programs occurring during the break  — March 14-15 through March 21-22 — have been canceled because of the ever-evolving coronavirus (COVID-19).


Vice President of USF World Roger Brindley announced in an email that the charges for the trip will be reversed on students’ accounts. However, students had to pay out of pocket for their flights, which could have been anywhere from $500-$1,300.


Some major U.S. airlines are offering full refunds or providing a refund in the form of credit which can be used over the next year.


Although the threat in Florida is still low despite the four confirmed cases, in Europe the spread of the virus has caused schools and universities to temporarily shut down. The number of cases in Italy has climbed to 3,000 with over 100 deaths, according to The New York Times.


USF is choosing to cancel the programs from recommendations by the U.S. State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).


No cancellations or details about summer education abroad have been announced at this time.
