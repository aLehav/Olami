A leak in a chilled water supply line has affected air temperatures in 65 buildings across campus, but Associate Director of Communications Aaron Nichols said the issue should be resolved quickly by the Facilities Management team.


The issue began around 1 a.m. Tuesday morning, in which a plan was developed within an hour to restore services to the affected buildings that include the Marshall Student Center, The Hub and some residence halls, according to Nichols. To fix the problem, parts had to be ordered overnight and repairs started Tuesday at noon.


The chilled water supply line does not impact ventilation of buildings, but rather the production of cold air indoors.


As of 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, Nichols said 40 buildings are still facing issues concerning air temperatures. The buildings that have currently been fixed have only received temporary repairs, as full repairs are expected to be completed Tuesday night.


Buildings that have received temporary fixes include Interdisciplinary Sciences and the Contemporary Art Museum.


Chilled water is expected to be completely restored by 5 p.m. in half of the initial 65 buildings impacted, with the other half projected to be fixed by 11 p.m.


Although Nichols said services are expected to be restored by Tuesday night, isolated incidents could occur after which the facilities team is prepared to address.


At the time of publication, it is unclear how the issue will affect faculty schedules and some events taking place throughout the day, such as Tuesday nightâ€™s University Lecture Series featuring Stephanie Beatriz.


The issue was resolved by the Facilities Management team Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
