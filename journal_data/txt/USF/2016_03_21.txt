A possibly armed individual on the northwest corner of campus remains unconfirmed, but an investigation is still underway.


At 1:42 p.m., University Police (UP) and the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office received a call from a third party reporting a possibly armed man crossing the Fletcher Avenue onto campus near Florida Hospital Tampa. The man was described as a black male in his early 30’s wearing a tan trench coat and a green hat.


UP responded immediately and flooded the area with officers. The adjacent area was searched by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. No one matching the description has been located and UP has not received any more calls concerning the individual.


UP will continue to patrol the area and investigate.


“We’ll continue to try to see if we can confirm whether or not this individual entered the campus or locate the individual … (for) as long as we feel necessary,” UP Lieutenant Charlotte Domingo said.


Domingo recommends students exercise caution and report any suspicious activity though they are free to resume normal activity.
