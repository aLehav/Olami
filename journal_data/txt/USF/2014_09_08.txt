The USF volleyball team saw its first action at home this season, hosting three teams at the Corral for the USF Invitational this weekend.


The Bulls were able to win two of three matches.


USF won its first match of the season against Buffalo on Friday afternoon in front of 615 people. The five-set match concluded with a final set score of 16-14 with junior outside hitter Erin Fairs recording the go-ahead kill.


Fairs posted a double-double for USF with 20 kills and 25 digs.


“That’s a big double-double,” coach Courtney Draper said in a press release. “Usually double-doubles are in the teens, but she was in the 20’s in both categories. She’s putting up some great numbers for us and she’s just playing a solid, all-around game.”


The Bulls matched up against FIU in their second match of the weekend Friday evening.


Despite another 20 kills from Fairs, USF lost to the Panthers in four sets.


FIU posted 15 blocks and had four players reach double-digit digs.


USF nearly pushed the match to five sets, tying FIU five separate times in the final set, but fell 24-20.


The Bulls were able to get back to their winning ways in the final match of the weekend as they swept South Carolina State in three sets.


All 16 players for the Bulls played in the weekend blowout.


USF will look to continue its winning start this weekend when they begin the Active Ankle Challenge. The Bulls face off against Winthrop on Friday at 5 p.m. in Auburn.
