Collins, who played in 116 games with the Bulls, is one of nine players to transfer out of the program this offseason. Other players who have entered the transfer portal include guards Xavier Casta√±eda and Ezacuras Dawson III, forwards Luke Anderson, Alexis Yetna, Justin Brown, Madut Akec and Rashun Williams, and center Michael Durr.


Of the players who have left, five others aside from Collins have found new homes.


Anderson
committed
to the College of Southern Idaho shortly after entering the portal, Yetna
went to
Seton Hall, Durr
elected
to go to Virginia Tech, Casta√±eda
chose
the University of Akron and Brown
opted
for UAB.


Each of the players announced their intent to transfer to their new schools via a post on social media or in Anderson‚Äôs case, a retweet of someone else‚Äôs post.


Durr and Collins both transferred to schools in the ACC and Yetna went to the Big East. Durr and Collins are also likely to play against one another next season.


Akec, Williams and Dawson have yet to announce where they will be heading next season.


In an effort to recoup some of the talent that has left the team, the Bulls have officially announced the incoming transfers of four players between April 9 and April 19.


Sam Hines Jr. from the University of Denver was announced via a
tweet
April 9, Javon Greene from George Mason was
announced
April 14 and
DJ Patrick
from Triton College as well as
Jake Boggs
from UNC-Wilmington were announced April 19.


Greene, who was a three-year starter at George Mason, averaged 11.5 points and five rebounds per game last season for the Patriots.
