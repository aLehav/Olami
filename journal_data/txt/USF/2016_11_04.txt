The next two ULS speakers are retired Army veteran Wesley Clark and sexual education activist Laci Green.


SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE




The University Lecture Series (ULS) will bring Wesley Clark, retired four-star general and NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, to the Oval Theater on Wednesday at 7 p.m.


Clark was selected in collaboration with Student Government and the Center for Strategic & Diplomatic Studies for his “leadership experience,” according to a press release.


He spent 38 years in the U.S. Army before retiring in 2000. Since then, he’s worked as an investment banker, alternative energy leader, instructor, businessman and military analyst. He also briefly ran for president in 2004. He’s written three books about war, including one released in 2014 titled “Don’t Wait for the Next War,” which tackles the country’s current and future national security challenges.


Additionally, ULS is bringing sexual education activist Laci Green to speak on Nov. 15. The speech starts at 8 p.m. in the Oval Theater.


Green specializes in sexual education with her show “Sex Plus,” which receives 5 million monthly viewers in 196 different countries through YouTube. She also writes and hosts the show “MTV Braless” and produces an educational series for Planned Parenthood.


She graduated from UC-Berkeley with a certificate in rape and dating violence crisis counseling and has worked with hundreds of organizations on sexual health and sexual violence prevention efforts. She’s expected to discuss these topics during her speech, according to the release.


Both lectures are open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis, but USF students receive priority seating.
