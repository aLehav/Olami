A student is still in the hospital after an on-campus motorcycle accident Thursday night, according to Danielle McDonald
,
the dean of students.


Fiifi Sam was in critical condition Friday and McDonald said she did not feel at liberty to say whether his condition has improved.


Sam was riding passenger with Etim Etim-Inyang on a motorcycle when
there was a collision
with a Toyota Corolla driven by Tresa Maria at the corner of USF Holly Drive and USF Maple Drive.


Etim-Inyang, who was wearing a helmet, was taken to the hospital for minor injuries, according to the Tampa Bay Times, and John was not injured. However, Sam — who was not wearing a helmet — was taken to Tampa General Hospital with critical injuries.


“The Dean of Students office has been working with and supporting the family,” McDonald said after visiting the hospital Monday.
