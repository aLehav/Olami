Junior USF football player Frederick Lloyd
announced on Twitter
Monday afternoon that he will be entering the transfer portal.


“I would like to start by saying thank you to my brothers for the bonds we created over the last four years,” Lloyd said in his Twitter post. “Furthermore I would also like to thank the coaches that have impacted my growth with my time being at USF. For that I will always be proud to say I was once a Bull.


“With that being said, my time at USF has ran its course and I am now seeking new beginnings. I will be entering my name in the [transfer] portal and transferring from USF as a graduate student with two years of eligibility left.”


Lloyd is 6-foot-5-inches and has primarily played tight end in his time with the Bulls. He also was working at wide receiver this offseason.


In total, he appeared in 27 games at USF from 2018-2020 after redshirting his freshman year in 2017, mostly on special teams.
