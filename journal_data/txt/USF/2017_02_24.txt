USF softball has lost last year’s AAC Player of the Year and offensive leader Juli Weber, as the school confirmed Friday that she has been permanently removed from the team for an undisclosed reason.


Weber, who started all of the Bulls’ 61 games in 2016, led the team in several offensive categories including batting average (.406), runs scored (49) and total bases (117).


“I can confirm that as of February 21, 2017, Juli Weber is no longer a member of the USF softball team,” coach Ken Eriksen said.
“
This was purely a coach’s decision that I felt was in the best interest of the program and the success of our team moving forward. Due to student privacy concerns, I cannot comment further.”


No. 23 USF is 7-3 thus far and will next play a four-game set in the Stetson Tournament in DeLand, beginning with a game against Mississippi tonight at 6:30 p.m.
