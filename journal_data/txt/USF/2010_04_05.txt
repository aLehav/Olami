As clubgoers filled the streets of Ybor City on Friday night, the Arctic Monkeys brought a taste of Sheffield, England to Tampa Bay.


It’s the first time in three years the four-man group – that topped the England charts with three No. 1 albums – has visited the U.S., gaining numerous fans and wooing over notable critics.


And the sold-out crowd at the Ritz in Ybor – the band’s second stop on their tour – made their success evident.


The Monkeys started with one of their slower songs, “Fire and the Thud,” but quickly followed up with the thumping song, “Brianstorm” featured on Guitar Hero 5. Strobe lights complimented the song’s vibrating drums and deep vocals.


It wasn’t until the song ended that lead singer, Alex Turner, introduced himself and the band. Of course, the fans approved the rocking loud start with their screams and sing- alongs.


Later, the band played its well-known track, “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,” and some of its less mainstream work, including “This House is a Circus,” “Do Me a Favour” and “Fluorescent Adolescent.”


The band finished with just as much force as when they started, including an acoustic set from Turner – a different sound than what fans expected.


The most notable acoustic song from the collection was “505” that began with an acapella solo before quickly turning into a rocking number.


Satisfied fans cheered as the final song ended. Many waited for photos and autographs after the show.
