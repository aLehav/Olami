A tweet from Bulls football strength and conditioning coach Hans
Straub
made USF coach Willie Taggart “very disappointed,” according to an article in the Tampa Tribune.


“Thought an organization with 5 Super Bowl titles would have a stricter draft criteria,”
Straub
tweeted after former USF defensive end Aaron Lynch was drafted by the San Francisco
49ers
.  “Clearly, integrity & character are not a priority.”


The tweet has since been deleted.


According to an email from USF Associate Athletic Director for Communications Brian
Siegrist
, Hans
Straub
submitted his resignation to USF AD Mark Harlan. The email stated a national search for his replacement will begin immediately.


Taggart was once an assistant under Jim
Harbaugh
, who is currently the coach of the
49ers
.


Lynch, a fifth-round pick in this year’s NFL draft, earned first-team
AAC
honors by leading the team with six sacks and 12.5 tackles for a loss.


Lynch was suspended for the first quarter of USF’s game against Louisville on Oct. 26. for violating team rules.
