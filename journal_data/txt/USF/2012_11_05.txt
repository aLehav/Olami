Eighteen-year-old Nathan Barker, who is not affiliated with USF, was arrested and charged with battery on a law enforcement officer, underage possession of alcohol and obstructing or opposing an officer without violence Sunday morning.
At approximately 1:50 a.m., University Police (UP) officers responded to a call reporting underage possession of alcohol near Holly Drive and Ash Drive. When the officer first made contact with Barker, Barker stuck the officer and fled on foot, according to an email from Lt. Charlotte Domingo, public information officer for UP.
A “foot pursuit and search” was then conducted and Barker was eventually located on North Palm Drive on campus. He was then taken into custody and transported to the Hillsborough County Jail. At the time of print Barker remained in jail with bail set at $2,750.
