Baltimore Ravens coach John
Harbaugh
, who was in town for the Ravens’ game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Thursday night, visited the Bulls’ practice Thursday morning and paid a visit to his friend, USF coach Willie Taggart.


Taggart,
Harbaugh
said, was like a brother to him and the “first son” of his dad, Jack
Harbaugh
, the former coach of Western Kentucky, where Taggart played college football and later coached. John
Harbaugh
spoke to USF players as they huddled and asked them about what it meant to win.
