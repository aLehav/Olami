Kathy Castor, Congressional representative (D) for Tampa and daughter of former USF president Betty Castor, is speaking today about current political events.


The event is hosted by the Honors College. Charles Adams, Dean of the College, said the event is a way for students to connect with their representatives.


“It’s an opportunity [for students] to talk to someone who’s in the middle of all those discussions … in Washington,” he said.


Castor has represented the Tampa area since 2006. She is the first woman to represent Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties in Congress.


A graduate of Chamberlain High School, Castor continued her education at Emory University and Florida State University College of Law.


The event will be held in JPH 1317 at 6 p.m.
