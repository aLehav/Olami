Prasant Mohapatra, vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Davis, will start as the provost and executive vice president of academic affairs on March 1, according to a Monday universitywide email.


Mohapatra was the only candidate in the running for the position, as the original search that occurred last fall was scrapped when Interim Provost Eric Eisenberg was asked to withdraw. After a brief pause during the fall semester, the search for a new provost was resumed on Jan. 3.


Eisenberg assumed a newly created position on the presidential cabinet as senior vice president of university-community partnerships. He will continue his duties as interim provost until Mohapatra officially begins.


On Jan.10-11, three town halls were held across all campuses where Mohapatra was given the chance to outline his plans and goals for the university to the public.


President Rhea Law said Mohapatra’s experience will prove him to be the right fit for the role.


“I am excited to welcome Dr. Mohapatra to the University of South Florida family,” Law said. “His extensive teaching, research and leadership experience will help build on our momentum and take USF to new heights of academic excellence.”
