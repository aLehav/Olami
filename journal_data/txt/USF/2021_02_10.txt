The USF women’s soccer team had its game against SMU scheduled for Feb. 14 postponed due to COVID-19-related issues within the Mustangs’ program, USF Athletics announced Wednesday.


A date to reschedule the match has yet to be determined.


The Bulls (1-0) opened their season last week with a 3-0 win over Florida Atlantic at Corbett Stadium.


The next game on the schedule for USF is a Feb. 21 matchup against Temple at 1 p.m. at home.


The match against Temple will be streamed live on ESPN+ and
broadcast on 95.3/620 WDAE/iHeartRadio Bulls Unlimited.
