The USF African Student Association (ASA) began a collection drive Sunday in commemoration of World Refugee Day 2009.


Donations of clothes, books, backpacks, shoes and other items can be dropped off through Friday on the third floor of the Marshall Student Center (MSC) in the Office of Student Programs.


ASA partnered with Lutheran Services Florida (LSF) to organize a World Refugee Day event at USF on Friday, said ASA Director of Activities Ijeoma Ekenta, a senior international studies major.


At the event, the collected donations will be given to LSF, an organization that helps refugees with their various needs, including transitioning from their country to the United States. LSF will then distribute the items to local refugees.


World Refugee Day was initially promoted by the United Nations and is celebrated worldwide, said senior computer engineering major Olisaemeka Echeazu, president of ASA.


A group of refugees will share their life experiences during Friday’s event.


There will be also free health screenings and children’s activities, including face painting, dancing and games.


The event will take place from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in the TECO room of the College of Education building. Everyone is welcome to attend.
