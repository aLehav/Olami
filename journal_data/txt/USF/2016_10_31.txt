The USF men’s basketball team will be without it’s leading scorer, sophomore point guard Jahmal McMurray, for the first six games of the season after a “violation of university policy,” according to the school.


“I can confirm that Jahmal McMurray is being withheld from competition for six games,” Antigua said in a statement. “Jahmal will continue to practice with the team and if he meets all of my expectations, will return to competition Dec. 3rd.”


First reported by the Tampa Bay Times, the suspension comes after a turmoil-filled offseason that saw the resignation of assistant coach Oliver Antigua — brother of head coach Orlando Antigua —in July after an NCAA probe into possible academic-related violations.


The program also dismissed two players, forward Chris Perry and guard Roddy Peters, for multiple violations of team rules in the spring.


To add to that, two USF’s prized recruits, Troy Baxter and Andres Feliz are no longer with the team.


McMurray was USF’s lone bright spot during its 8-25 season. He averaged 15.2 points and 35.2 minutes in 2015.
