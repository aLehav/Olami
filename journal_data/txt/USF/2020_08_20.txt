In the span of a couple of weeks, USF football’s nonconference schedule went from virtually nonexistent to potentially landing one of the big ones.


A report by Tim Prister of Irish Illustrated on Wednesday night indicated the Bulls will travel to Notre Dame Stadium on Sept. 19. The Fighting Irish has a vacancy after Western Michigan and the MAC canceled its season earlier this month, and USF was scheduled to play Nevada before the MEAC season was canceled.


With Notre Dame playing as an ACC member this season, the game against USF would be its only nonconference matchup.

The news came after the
Fighting Irish suspended its practice due to 222 coronavirus cases since Aug. 3
. As a result of the spike in cases, Notre Dame moved its classes to online-only instruction until at least Sept. 2.


The Bulls hold a 1-0 all-time record over the Fighting Irish — their one and only meeting was the 2011 season opener in which USF won 23-20.
