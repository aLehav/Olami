After scoring the winning goal on Saturday in Greenville against ECU for South Florida women’s soccer, freshman forward Haizea Aretxabala Blanco was named AAC Rookie of the Week.


Blanco’s first collegiate goal snagged the Bulls (7-6, 4-1 AAC) the 2-1 victory against the Pirates (7-6-2, 2-2-1 AAC). With less than 10 minutes on the clock, Blanco was able to extend USF’s winning streak to four games.


In a preseason press conference, coach Denise Schilte-Brown emphasized she wanted to focus on maintaining the final third of the game. Even though it was early, she was confident in Blanco’s abilities to do so.


“Our striker Haizea is very good back to goal and is quite dangerous with her head so we’ll see how it develops,” Schilte-Brown said.


Throughout the game, Blanco played for 12 minutes and only had one shot on goal. Originally from Spain, the true freshman has played 10 games for South Florida this season for a total of 400 minutes.
