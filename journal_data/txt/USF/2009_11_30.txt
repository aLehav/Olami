LOS ANGELES â€“ Authorities say an aerialist performing during a holiday show at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles has been hospitalized after falling three stories to the shopping mall floor.


Ray Pierce of Hollywood Aerial Arts, the firm putting on the performance, says the 26-year-old woman slipped Saturday night while hanging upside down from a metal hoop during the finale of the show.


Pierce says the performer fell into a video projection cube and injured her wrist and pelvis. She was not wearing a harness and no nets broke her fall.
