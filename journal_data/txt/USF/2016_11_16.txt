A USF student was robbed Tuesday night at 9:15 while walking near the Interdisciplinary Science Building, University Police (UP) said. UP are looking for two suspects who attempted to take the student's possessions, but otherwise left her unharmed.


One suspect was described as having shoulder-length blond hair and wearing a white shirt with khaki shorts, while the other as having blond hair and wearing gray sweatpants with a dark blue shirt, according to UP. Both were in their early 20s.


UP is currently conducting interviews with the victim and potential witnesses. The victim reported to UP that she was followed by the suspects while walking through the MLK Plaza toward ISA. They engaged her in conversation before grabbing her backpack and causing her necklace to fall off. Police recovered all of the victim's property at the scene.
