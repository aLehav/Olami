Coming in one by one in their vibrant, vestuarios flowing onto the makeshift stage set in the USC Village Plaza, members of Grupo Folklórico de USC began their inaugural Día de los Muertos Showcase by performing Flor de Piña, a regional song from Oaxaca, Mexico.
An audience of more than 200 people, including President Carol Folt, watched the dancers sway and dance back and forth across the stage while balancing pineapples on their shoulders.  
Off to one side of the stage, a Día de los Muertos altar honoring friends and family members who have passed away decorated with marigold flowers, pan de muerto, candles and photos. The spiritual holiday is typically celebrated from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2 and is rooted in indigenous and mestizo culture in Mexico. 
“In a lot of cultures, death is something that’s almost feared, and I think Día de los Muertos is something that embraces it,” said Ada Marys Lorenzana, a member of the group. “I think the best thing we did with this performance is try to honor that culture and try to honor our loved ones.” 
By hosting the event, the club wanted to represent Mexican culture and the Latinx community on campus by taking up such a large and prominent space frequented by students and neighbors daily. 
“[Latinx students] are a very small percentage on campus,” said Evelyn Lopez, a 2019 alumna who led the effort to reestablish Grupo Folklórico de USC last year. “We’re about [15%] right now … We just want to represent that little portion of campus and the fact that we are in [a community that USC resides in] which is primarily minorities.”
Paola Morales, a junior majoring in political science, said she was impressed with the effort the group put into the showcase and was particularly fond of the Sinaloa performance that expressed the vibrant garments of the region. 
“What made me come out [to the showcase] is being able to see my culture represented in a space that is predominantly white people and being right here in the middle of campus [where] everyone can see and that my culture is so vibrant and beautiful,” Morales said. 
The group performed Mexican regional dances from Guerrero, Yucatán, Sinaloa and Chihuahua to songs such as “La Iguana,” “El Coyote” and “Las Aguas de Río Nonoava.” Each dance tells a story about the region displayed through their varying choreography with each number and outfit changes. 
Folt arrived toward the beginning of the event, standing in the back of the audience to not steer attention away from the performance. At the end of the event, Folkórico members invited her to the altar where they explained the personal significance of the event to the Latinx community. 
“I just think this is a beautiful cultural event,” Folt said. “I love that it is designed to both celebrate the culture by the people whose culture it is and teach everybody else about it. So I’d love to see every single USC student here because it’s wonderful.” 
Morales, who noticed Folt at the event, was happy to see that Folt was making an effort to be involved in cultural events that pertain to underrepresented groups on campus. 
“It made me feel good that I saw President Folt made an appearance,” Morales said. “She actually stayed here to interact with students and see the work that the students put in — I think that shows her commitment to students of color and to diversity on this campus.” 
Grupo Folklórico de USC, which students reestablished in 2018 following a hiatus that lasted several years, practices in the Jefferson Boulevard Parking Structure two nights a week under the lighting of Dedeaux Field, which the group’s president Linda Diaz said often turns off by 7:30 p.m.  
“And then we’re pretty much in the dark. When we’re preparing, especially for this showcase, we’re using our flashlights on our phones just to try to see what we’re doing,” Diaz said. “And every now and then cars will have to pass by so we have to pause a rehearsal and allow them to pass just for safety.”
There is no current update to the fate of the group’s practice area for next semester, however the group has arranged a meeting with Student Affairs to resolve this issue for dance groups on campus. 
Although the group hoped for better circumstances to prepare for its showcase, Mia Islas, a freshman majoring in communication, said the show helped her feel represented on campus.
“It’s like a part of our culture that we grew up seeing, so seeing it where we’re living and like in a city that we could see ourselves living in for the rest of our lives is comforting,” Islas said. “It’s like going back home or like making a new home.”

Hundreds of students attended USC’s inaugural College Yoga Day, an all-day event held by the non-profit organization College Yoga Day in Associates Park. Live music and meditation sessions animated USC’s outdoor spaces as a joint collaboration between Student Affairs, the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life and the Physical Education Program.
The festival introduced the community to  yoga instructors and healthy lifestyle alternatives such as stress management techniques and meditation available on campus. College Yoga Day was directed by Loyola Marymount University professor Eden Goldman, who also founded Meditating Mascots, a yoga and mindfulness company that sells mascot-like plush toys and products to promote mindfulness on college campuses.
“All of this evolved out of what happened last year in February on Valentine’s Day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. … That was my high school,” Goldman said. “We came up with this idea as a way to bring more peace to campuses, and we thought we could make a big influence in that regard.” 
Students, faculty and staff were invited to participate in workshops throughout the day, including live music performances and yoga and meditation sessions and presentations on the science of wellness. Jennifer Guinter, a yoga instructor at USC, attended the event to support longtime friend Goldman and promote the things she loves to teach her students.
“It’s one thing to kind of roll out your yoga mat, do your yoga practice, roll it back up and walk home, which is great [because] it’s mindfulness, and building physical strength is important and nice, but we wanted to create more of a community environment,” Guinter said. “A lot of people engage in sports or Greek life and things like this but yoga and mindfulness are really geared toward self-care.”
Several organizations from USC attended the event, such as the Music Meditation Club, a student club that aims to create a safe space for students to come and experience the benefits of meditation in all forms. 
At the festival, club members distributed manuals on mindfulness as well as instructional guides on meditation. 
“At our club, we invite specific yoga teachers, meditation teachers, healing teachers that can come and give a short experience to the students,” said Hari Bhakta, a senior majoring in philosophy. “This was a perfect place to come and connect with like-minded individuals.”
Gould School of Law student Tammi Matsukiyo also emphasized the importance of the event as a means for stress relief. Matsukiyo said she was glad she attended the festival in order to learn about underrepresented health practices.  
“We were walking into [Lyon Recreation Center] and we saw a sign that said Yoga Day …,’ so we decided to head over.” Matsukiyo said. “It’s really important to promote alternative ways of exercising and alternative healing and stuff like that.”
The event also worked with local businesses and community leaders such as Sunshine Shop, an online apparel store that aims to promote a message of mindfulness and positivity.
“One of the organizers, [Goldman], he’s a good friend of ours, and he’s been a yoga instructor for us for a little while,” said Frank Bach, a representative of the Sunshine Shop. “[It’s] just this common theme of wellness and self-care and meditation and yoga. We land inside that umbrella.” 
Jay Valin, a College Yoga Day collaborator who helped organize the event on campus, said the non-profit plans to execute more events not just at USC but at other college campuses as well. 
“The next event will be at the University of Miami on Nov. 16 and then UCLA in February,” Valin said. “Next year, we plan on launching 15 other schools throughout the country.”

“How I Met Your Mother” star Josh Radnor discussed his struggles with mental health and his success in the entertainment industry at Bovard Auditorium Thursday evening. Starting the event by passing out complimentary snacks to attendees, Radnor casually fielded questions from audience members. 
Radnor was invited by the Academic Culture Assembly as the final speaker for Mental Health Awareness Month. He detailed his struggles with depression during the first few seasons of “How I Met Your Mother” and how celebrity status brought little fulfillment to his life. Radnor attributed multiple shamanic trips to Brazil, where he drank the hallucinogenic brew Ayahuasca, as an important turning point in his mental well-being. 
 “There was something about being demolished or bowing at the feet of that enormous medicine … It really gave me some sense of something much bigger than what was happening on CBS,” Radnor said. 
Radnor does not recommend Ayahuasca for everyone but discussed the importance of therapy and meditation for improving his mental health. 
Students also asked Radnor how to deal with feelings of self-doubt and tackling career transitions. The actor emphasized the significance of finding a mentor to build confidence and accepting the inevitable struggles of adulthood.
“I don’t know a single person that has just an single uninterrupted rollercoaster of ‘this is only getting better,’” Radnor said. “It just doesn’t happen that way.” 
 For the theatre majors in the audience, Radnor recounted stories of failed acting endeavors and doled out advice on the need for perseverance in the entertainment industry.
 “A lot of people have the talent to be a professional actor; not everyone has the stomach,” Radnor said.
 Many attendees asked Radnor about his most famous role as Ted Mosby from “How I Met Your Mother.” While Radnor said he appreciated his time on the show and the opportunities it provided him, he wishes fans could separate his identity from the sitcom personality. But, the actor still cherishes the enthusiasm and joy the series continues to provide its fans.
“I don’t know what I did or what we did to have made a show that has a certain antidepressant quality to it, but it’s unbelievable,” Radnor said.
Radnor also spoke about how his love of stories translated into songwriting. After starting the band Radnor & Lee in 2016, music has become another creative outlet for the actor and director. He performed three of the duo’s songs at the lecture, including “Goodbye House” and “Apocalyptic Love Song.”
Taylor Tryon, a junior majoring in economics, attended the event and found that, while tailored more toward creatives, Radnor’s advice on success was applicable to her own life.
“The idea to just kind of keep centered and focused, and what’s meant for you will come, and what’s not won’t and that you just have to be along for the journey,” Tryon said.

Michael Pittman Jr. should go down as a USC great because of games like Friday night’s. After a relatively quiet first three quarters against Colorado, the senior wide receiver exploded for 156 yards and two touchdowns in the final frame against the Buffaloes, helping the Trojans overcome a 10-point deficit and earn a tight 35-31 victory.
Pittman got to work almost immediately in the fourth quarter, reeling in a 44-yard touchdown along the left sideline with 11 and a half minutes left. He burned the Buffaloes on a vertical route, finding the hole between the cornerback and the safety in a blown coverage and retaining possession through a hit that forced his chin strap over his mouth.
People may forget Pittman’s first two catches on the game-winning drive, one of which was a tough, contested grab on third-and-10, because of how the possession ended. Pittman took a pass over the middle and turned on the jets to speed past the defenders before diving across the goal line for the go-ahead 37-yard score with just over two minutes left.
“The line just opened up and Kedon just threw a great ball. It just kept me in stride and I just kind of ran around the defense,” Pittman said of the clincher.
USC hasn’t had a ton of big games as Pittman has ascended to stardom, but it’s pretty difficult to think of one he didn’t show up for. Even as a seldom-used sophomore in 2017, Pittman made a massive impact in the contests that mattered most. Over a three-game span at the end of the season, he caught a third-down touchdown to jump start the offense in the team’s Pac-12 South-clinching win over Colorado, returned a punt for a score on a trick play against rival UCLA and exploded for seven receptions, 146 yards and a touchdown in USC’s close win over Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship Game.
2018 doesn’t bring back fond memories for any USC fan, but Pittman was a silver lining for much of it. 
His six catches for 155 yards and two touchdowns against Colorado (man, Buffalo fans won’t miss seeing No. 6 out there) were crucial to a team that, at that point, felt it could win the division again. USC fell apart at the end of the season, but it was certainly no fault of Pittman’s; he averaged six receptions for 109.8 yards and a touchdown per game over his final five contests.
Expectations were high entering this season, and Pittman has certainly delivered. His 10-reception, 232-yard and two-touchdown game against a tough Utah secondary was one of the best receiving performances in USC history, which is not a statement to be taken lightly. 
Pittman’s 77-yard touchdown, in which he beat a defender to a jump ball and held off another on a long run to the end zone as the Coliseum erupted around him, is likely to be the defining play of this season.
Pittman was the biggest reason the Trojans nearly beat BYU and stayed within striking distance of Washington on the road. And Friday night, when USC needed a win to continue to control its own destiny in the South, he willed the team to victory with his dominant fourth quarter.
Besides his prolific performance against Utah, Pittman isn’t likely to show up in the USC record books in a major way. He could find his way into the program’s top 10 in all-time touchdown receptions, but his reception and receiving yard numbers won’t be nearly great enough to match all-time greats like Robert Woods and Marqise Lee. Because Pittman didn’t become a prominent member of the offense until his junior year, he just hasn’t had enough time to make that sort of impression with cumulative numbers.
But Pittman will leave his legacy on this program for his reputation as a big-game player. 
Guys who raise their games in the most important moments are incredibly valuable to their teams and earn the undying loyalty of their fanbases. It’s why Patriots and Lakers fans won’t hear a word against receiver Julian Edelman or former guard Derek Fisher  — those guys don’t have the numbers to qualify as all-timers, but they both have a track record of coming through in the biggest moments. 
Pittman definitely fits that bill. Perhaps it’s a result of being the son of a long-time NFL running back, but Pittman seems to have a level of comfort under pressure and an understanding of these big moments that few players do.
Pittman’s performance this season has him shooting up NFL draft boards, and for good reason. He is showcasing not only a well-rounded skill set, but a propensity for excelling when the lights shine the brightest, which NFL teams love. But for the last few years, Pittman has been doing something that has greater long-term significance: solidifying himself as a certifiable Trojan great.

How much sleep did you get last night? How much coffee did you drink this morning?  When stress is a culture, cups of coffee and hours of sleep — or lack thereof — are a commodity.
Among the faux-Gothic red bricks of USC, eye bags replace Birkin bags, and students wear their stress like a Gucci belt: proudly and performatively. When stress is more than a feeling, more than a momentary aberration, but rather a lifestyle — a culture even — then we can ascertain meaning from it, develop a sense of self based off of it.
Certainly, you’d be remiss to find a college student who isn’t stressed out. School, work, social obligations, the demands of a still-forming prefrontal cortex and an uncertain future all come together during the college years to create a person invariably on the verge of frantic implosion.
Yet at schools like USC, this natural stress reconstitutes itself from something to avoid into something to aspire to. An all-nighter and copious espresso shots are, in fact, tangible examples of one’s dedication.
Quickly, this fuels a secondary culture of one-upmanship. Oh, you got three hours of sleep? Well, I got two. You’re taking five classes? I’m taking eight. It’s the suffering Olympics, and the first one to collapse wins.
Why would any sane being aspire to sleep deprivation and espresso-induced tachycardia? I’ll assume no one actually enjoys fatigue and heart palpitations, but sometimes the Herculean requirements of college — and life in general — necessitate all-nighters and Starbucks ventis.
It’s within these bleary-eyed, post-midterm Wednesdays that we must search for meaning. No one actually enjoys feeling like a bag of bones about to crumble outside of Taper Hall, but if we can assign purpose to this egregious state of exhaustion, then maybe all of that suffering is worth it.
By defining my negligible hours of sleep and concerningly frequent trips to Starbucks as evidence of my hard work and my ambition, I begin to construct an identity. I wear my eye bags like a badge of honor. I prescribe hierarchy to the world around me. That girl next to me in lecture who looks perfectly well-rested and doesn’t flash coffee-stained teeth when she smiles? She must not care as much as I do; she must not be as hardworking as me.
It’s perhaps human nature to construct our identities around the circumstances presented to us. If I’m going to look like a tired rat in my 8 a.m. lecture, I might as well feel like my tiredness projects some positive aspect of my personality. These eye bags are a statement piece of my work ethic. 
However, basing your identity around one thing is a treacherous path. I can’t hide behind these eye bags forever. Eventually, I’ll need a nap, and when I wake up, I have to figure out how to form a sense of self that doesn’t depend on burnout. 
When exhaustion is an aspiration, we forget that it’s actually quite bad for us. As good as it might feel to momentarily win the sleep-deprivation Olympics, a lack of sleep and too much stress create compounding health issues.
In the moment, sleep deprivation causes difficulty concentrating, difficulty making decisions, emotional downturns and increased risk of accident and injury. When a pattern of sleep deprivation continues, it can invite serious medical conditions including heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.
Similarly, accumulated stress can do any and all of the following: make it difficult to control emotions, promote various diseases, affect your love life, hurt your heart, cause weight gain, contribute to premature aging — ask any U.S. president — and weaken your immune system.
Stress is unavoidable. Sleep is hard to come by. This is true in college, and this will be true throughout the rest of our lives. But rather than incentivizing one another to sleep less and do more, we should actively work to establish positive, maintainable habits that will set us up for success in the future: Sleep deprivation and caffeine addiction need not apply.
USC students be warned: Stress is a false god. Do not worship at its altar.

The dominant professional culture at USC seems to shun the significance of the humanities. Professional schools like the Marshall School of Business and the Viterbi School of Engineering do not have foreign language requirements. Meanwhile, the German department has been dismantled, and the language major was removed in 2008. 
Programs in science, technology and entrepreneurship have grown in popularity, a trend made  evident with the recent opening of the new Iovine and Young Hall. But as the University’s reputation in business and engineering grows, programs in the humanities seem to quickly lose attention. 
This long-standing debate over the crisis of the humanities is not exclusive to USC. Since 2008, a drop in almost every humanities field was reported by the U.S. Board of Education, noting that history majors compose less than 45% of what they did in 2007, while the number of English majors has been cut almost in half since the ’90s. 
The 2019 budget proposed under President Donald Trump’s administration proposed the elimination of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency dedicated to supporting research, education and public programs in the humanities. Princeton and Stanford  universities have established programs recruiting high school students who are interested in the humanities, but numbers have still dropped. 
Although there are benefits to USC’s decision to place more emphasis on professional studies, what’s looked over in these efforts is the enrichment the humanities bring to one’s education. There is the valid concern that studying the humanities will yield a smaller range of job opportunities post-graduation. 
While an undergraduate humanities education may not hone the same technical skills as coding, they emphasize the development and mastery of other skills: reading and writing as well as creative, critical and quantitative thinking skills, more so than  STEM courses can teach.
They are essential in our increasingly interconnected global world, as the humanities encourage empathy for different cultures, histories and approaches to examining the world. They reveal how humans have tried to make moral, spiritual and philosophical sense of the societies and spaces around them through various mediums and creative endeavors. Humanities boils down to the study of storytelling: examining the artistic, historic and cultural products of the past and applying such knowledge to make informed predictions and projections about the future. 
The humanities are essential in promoting an interest and concern for the political and ethical dilemmas of today. A background in history assists not only in one’s ability to analyze current events but also in considering the tougher questions regarding right versus wrong and seeking change. 
It was also reported in 2016 that humanities majors demonstrate greater civic duty than other majors. According to U.S. Department of Education data for the class of 2008, 92.8% of humanities majors had voted in an election within a year of graduation; the same was true for 83.5% of STEM majors. It is clear that students with a background in verbal and critical skills may feel more ready to be civically and politically involved.
When reflecting on the role of scholarship, it is important to consider how a minimized focus on the humanities strays from higher education’s earliest intentions. Universities are spaces dedicated to more than trade and seeking job opportunities. They are centers for scholarship, spaces to openly question and critique, bastions of creative expression and home to the next generation of leaders and members of our global community. 
USC has in many ways done its part to ensure a humanities education in its students academic pursuits through the General Education program. It is ultimately, though, within the culture of the school — one that is undeniably wrought with concerns over professional application and ambition — that ought to concern itself with maintaining the integrity of the University through the continued appreciation, practice and study of the humanities.
