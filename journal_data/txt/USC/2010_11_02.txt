Leading up to Tuesday’s midterm elections, expectations for youth turnout at USC were predictably dismal. In the last few weeks, pundits have accused youth voters of everything from crippling laziness to lack of enthusiasm to naïve assumptions that the state will fix itself.
But around campus on Tuesday, the problem was not getting students to the polls — it was accommodating them once they arrived.
Students turned up in droves to vote on and around campus; the only on-campus polling station, Marks Tower, saw 500 students filter in throughout the day. But 80 percent of Marks voters — 399 of them — filed provisional ballots. These “challenged ballots” are usually counted more than a week after the results of the elections are announced.
Though it’s understandable that students would be more likely to fill out provisional ballots than other demographics — a particularly nomadic group, we tend to change residences frequently throughout our college tenure — political groups have been canvassing campus in the last month to ensure students didn’t have to resort to this.
The USC College Democrats, for example, had reportedly registered hundreds of students to vote around campus, including more than 50 at Marks tower. But according to College Democrats officials, the majority of the registered students were not on the list, forcing those who stuck around to vote provisionally.
This isn’t the first time USC polling stations have had trouble. In 2008, approximately one-third of the registered students who showed up to Our Savior Catholic Center to cast their ballots were not listed as registered. At the time, officials attributed the probable cause of the mix-up to a recent change in the campus’ ZIP code wreaking havoc in the registrar’s office, and steps were taken to prevent another snafu.
Apparently, these steps didn’t work.
Students occupy one of the most vulnerable voting blocs — our group is often depicted as disillusioned with politics and easily dissuaded from showing up. It’s dispiriting to see our political oomph diminish because of bureaucratic gaffes.
Student political groups worked commendably to inform students of their rights and stepped in to do damage control when the system faltered, but this is  a problem that now deserves attention from higher up.  It’s time for the university to flex its muscle as an influential force in the city and make sure the wrinkles are smoothed out in time for the next election.
The students have done their jobs. It’s time to make sure those votes count.
I showed up at Marks Tower to vote and they said I wasn’t registered-turns out a lot of the voter registration papers turned into Southside’s Battle of the Ballot didn’t get where they needed to go, which was quite upsetting as I was very excited to vote in my first “real” election.

Tuesday was expected to be an historic election, and it lived up to its billing. The House of Representatives is now firmly in Republican control, and the Democrats just barely held onto the Senate.
The punditry’s refrain has been that this is less a victory for Republicans than a loss for Democrats. The variety of Democratic losers — from moderates to extreme liberals, from clean campaigners to dirty ones — demonstrates this clearly.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Democratic incumbents who lost included Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida, a progressive whose offensive campaign ads labeling his opponent Daniel Webster “Taliban Dan” made him a favorite topic on Fox News; Rep. Tom Perriello of Virginia, whose focus on humanitarian issues in Africa and the Middle East did not resonate with voters; and Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, a “Blue Dog” Democrat who, despite almost single-handedly killing the public option during the healthcare debate, was still soundly defeated by the Republican opposition.
Other Democrats were saved only by the perceived lunacy of their opponents; it is unlikely that Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, Senator-elect Chris Coons of Delaware or Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo of New York would have defeated Republicans who did not embarrass themselves so thoroughly during the campaign.
Regardless of one’s political positions or campaign strategy, being a Democrat was enough to lose an election this year. What this shows is that voters were more interested in repudiating the Democratic leadership, particularly President Barack Obama and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, than they were in choosing between two individual candidates.
This outcome is the result of a double failure by the White House: a failure in action and a failure in communication.
Obama surely could have done more to spur the economy. One major change he could have made would be to prioritize it over healthcare, putting the latter debate on hold until the economy was growing again. This would have created more avenues for cooperation between parties and made stimulus spending less controversial. More generally, his proposals were normally tailor-made for partisanship; he could have focused on more consensus-generating ideas first.
But the greater failure was in communicating with the electorate. The White House’s message has been that it inherited a large hole from the Bush administration, one that takes a long time to escape. Regardless of its truthfulness, that message was clearly not enough to gather support for Obama’s policies.
Somehow, the president — whose campaign was characterized by its inspirational message — ran a White House that was known for its blandness and lack of spirit. As a result, Obama now faces an angry country and a troublesome Congress.
Since there is no such thing as a gap between election cycles in the age of CNN, focus has now shifted to Obama’s ability to win a second term in 2012. Unfortunately, it seems that the next two years are bound to disappoint virtually all Americans; therefore, the major determinant of Obama’s chances will be who gets the blame.
The Republican leadership is saying all the right things. In a tearful, patriotic speech Tuesday night, new House Speaker John Boehner said, “The people’s agenda will be our agenda. That is our pledge to America.”
Unfortunately for Boehner, the people’s agenda is a bit schizophrenic at the moment.
A September USA Today/Gallup Poll found that 77 percent of Americans think that entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare will create major economic problems for the United States in the next 25 years, but only 42 percent thinks government should raise taxes to fix this problem, and only 31 percent thinks government should cut benefits.
Similarly, a July Pew poll found that 80 percent of Americans find it very important for Congress to pass legislation to create jobs, which would presumably require either lowering taxes or increasing spending, but 70 percent find it very important for Congress to reduce the budget deficit.
It doesn’t take an accountant to realize that this is a group of people that cannot be satisfied. Currently, the government spends more money than it takes in, which creates a deficit. Yet public opinion polls demonstrate that Americans somehow want government to increase spending, cut taxes and lower the deficit all at the same time — something that is absolutely impossible.
Alarmingly, even Wall Street doesn’t seem to understand this basic math; according to the latest Reuters poll, its two highest priorities for Congress to focus on are tax cuts and deficit reduction.
Whether Republicans or Democrats are in power in Washington, government will remain unpopular until peoples’ expectations enter the realm of possibility. Given this fact, it is no wonder that Boehner made sure to qualify his remarks with, “We must remember it is the President who sets the agenda.”
Let the blame game begin.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Wednesdays.
So this was the anti-Democrat vote? Didn’t Obama become president on the “Anyone but a Republican” ticket? This was the biggest swing in House of Representatives in 70 years… and it went to the GOP… 2 years after Obama got in because he wasn’t a Republican. This isn’t a case of the Democrats losing, this is a case of politicians losing. We aren’t choosing a representative, we’re merely deciding the means of our rape. 
We hated the Bush years so we voted in Democrats. Now they’re screwing us over as well. Our only other option now is the same Republican party we despised 2 years ago? A revolution could be at hand.
What you say is basically true. Mark Steyn wrote about this the other day. If the GOP goes back to being “Democrat Lite” as they did during the Bush years, the American people will lose faith in the two parties and could very well found a new one. If the Democrats had won last night, the American people would have lost faith in the electoral process itself, and the result could have been national failure and revolution. The ball is in the GOP court now, and they have to prove that this time, they really mean what they say about limiting government, cutting spending, and rolling back the Democrat agenda… or else.
Well said, Joe! 
FYI to young Daniel: tax cuts and deficit reduction are not mutually exclusive. It is not that Wall Street doesn’t understand basic math, but that you are apparently unable to grasp the wealth-producing benefits of tax cuts. It’s not a zero sum game, Daniel.
LOL, the old “Obama hasn’t communicated enough” tack. I was wondering which excuse (of the many being thrown around by Democrats this year) the Daily Trojan might go with. Either it’s that the man who makes speeches constantly, everywhere, all the time, hasn’t communicated “enough”… or it’s that the people are stupid, or angry, and not thinking straight… or it’s that secret foreign money is coming in from the evil Chamber of Commerce… or… or… or…
Is it so hard to see that the American people know what you’ve done these past two years, they know what your agenda consists of, and they do. not. want. any. more.  Leftism is intellectually bankrupt. Leftism is morally bankrupt. What you’ve attempted is wrong, it doesn’t work, and the voters have put a stop to it. Proceed at your peril.

After a few clicks and a short Google Maps search later, it’s easy to see how far Saginaw, Mich., is from Taft, Calif.
To measure it in miles (2,304), however, wouldn’t quite tell you how far USC men’s basketball’s newest and youngest starting backcourt — freshmen Bryce Jones and Maurice Jones — have come to form an on-court bond that is bound to raise eyebrows from naysayers and skeptics alike.
In September 2009, while headlines of a falling football dynasty were swirling around USC, first-year basketball coach and top-notch recruiter Kevin O’Neill was putting into motion what would become his first class of incoming freshmen.
Recruiting visits are typically mundane, standard and trite. When Taft High School standout Bryce Jones made the nearby trek to USC’s athletic facilities for the first time, he was greeted by the unfamiliar yet welcoming face of Midwest recruit Maurice Jones.
Maurice Jones, who played at Arthur Hill High School — the same high school as two-time NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion Jason Richardson — is mild-mannered, reserved and lacks the vocal presence of the traditionally loud-mouthed, boisterous point guards in the Pac-10.
But though he might possess the subtle shyness that often accompanies an 18-year-old still trying to find himself thousands of miles away from home, it is on the court where Jones’ identity is most clearly defined.
A speedster and sensational distributor by nature, Maurice Jones’ cross-country trip to USC last September was not as clear-cut as his future running mate’s, who had already gained regional recognition for his high school exploits as an explosive offensive threat both on the perimeter and on the boards.
But encouraged by his high school coach Greg McMath — who just happened to be a close friend of O’Neill’s — the 5-foot-7 point guard was convinced into taking the recruiting trip for one reason: a chance to play in a big conference right away.
Although playing time was a motivating factor in the Midwesterner’s decision to start his collegiate career across the country, what ultimately drove his decision to don the cardinal and gold came from a sense of belonging that was fostered by his preliminary opportunity to bond with Bryce Jones and fellow newcomers Garrett Jackson and Curtis Washington.
“When I came on my initial visit, everybody on the team was cool, you know. We all hung out,” said Maurice Jones. “That was good for me to see who else was coming in with me if I decided to come here.”
For local-star Bryce Jones, the words “distributor” and “team player” were about as far from the 6-foot-5 shooting guard’s vernacular as Saginaw and Taft are in distance when he first met his future teammates. As an athlete who admitted last year that he was “selfish” and focused too often on competing for points with high school teammate DeAndre Daniels, a weekend with Maurice Jones, the Wolverine State’s premier, selfless floor general, seemed like a precarious situation on paper.
But just as championships are not won on paper, neither are the relationships.
From pickup games and taking in a USC football game to hanging out and sharing stories of future aspirations, it didn’t take long for Taft’s marquee talent to realize the two had a lot more in common than a surname.
“We all got along great,” Bryce Jones said. “During pickup games we played well together, so I kind of felt like we were all going to be here.”
Now, more than a year later, the gem of O’Neill’s 2010-2011 recruiting class isn’t just running the wing with his quickly forming partner in crime out on the hardwood — he’s living with him.
This summer the two freshmen trained together, played in tournaments together, ate pizza together, fawned over the formation of the Miami Heat’s new Big Three together, and, most importantly, matured together.
Their three months of unified growth is the type of bond that will instantly pay dividends between the black lines of the Galen Center, regardless of the academic year in which they are entering.
Although their biographies will tell a story of two separate individuals, raised in two separate backgrounds, driven on a court by two distinctly separate skill sets, it’s the component you can’t see which makes the pair an instant threat in the Pac-10.
Instinctive cohesion.
“It’s like no matter what, we always know where the other one is going to be on the floor,” Bryce Jones said.
With the influx of inexperienced players USC has seen prior to its 2010-2011 campaign, the No. 6 label that conference voters placed upon the unfazed Trojans’ last week is reasonable to say the least.
Although from an outsider’s point of view the upcoming season could result in a feast or famine-like outcome, the much-anticipated answer will likely be found in the youthful glue which holds together the Trojans’ continuous development: the Jones Boys.
Though even the most fortuitous prognosticator can’t be quite certain where this mixture of ability will be on the proverbial dance floor when the hands of time strike March, keeping up with the Joneses’ intangible connection might be a lot tougher for teams who make the mistake of measuring the Trojans’ backcourt simply by the numbers.

The two mystery positions that USC coach Lane Kiffin said he would re-evaluate this week were revealed Tuesday. Kiffin said Tuesday that the starting jobs of sophomore strong safety Jawanza Starling and senior left guard Butch Lewis are in jeopardy.
Kiffin is giving redshirt junior Marshall Jones a shot at the strong safety position that Starling has held throughout the season. Jones took almost all of the reps with the first team on Tuesday in the place of sophomore free safety T.J. McDonald, who was nursing a slight hamstring injury. However, Jones subbed in for both safeties against Oregon on Saturday and the coaches said they think he did well enough to give him a chance to earn Starling’s spot.
“We got our grades on Monday and I did pretty decent,” Jones said. “I made a couple mistakes but coach said I had a couple of good tackles, so if I continue to do that, I’m going see a lot more playing time.”

As for the left guard position, Kiffin said he is not pleased with Lewis’ performance. Redshirt junior Michael Reardon is poised to take over for Lewis a little more than a month after Kiffin tried Reardon out in the same position.
“We’re going to give Mike Reardon a shot there at practice, see how he plays at left guard because the production we’re getting there is completely unacceptable,” Kiffin said.
—
Speaking of the offensive line, Kiffin called many offensive players out during his weekly conference call Sunday.
“[The running game] has been something that has been very overrated this season,” he said, adding that the Trojans have only had three 100-yard rushers this year and that four of their opponents — Virginia, Minnesota, Washington State and Washington — are ranked less than 100 in rush defense in the nation.
Kiffin shifted this blame to the offensive line, which hasn’t played up to his standards.
“As I told our team, we played as bad up front as I’ve seen in my seven years of being here, and we’ve got to go back to practice this week and get a lot better to prove that we are a good running team because right now we are not,” Kiffin said.
While USC’s opponents had poor rush defenses, Kiffin said he thinks that the offensive line is playing much more inconsistently than it did earlier in the year.
“You look back to [the Oregon] game and pull some film from earlier in the year and they don’t look the same,” Kiffin said at practice on Tuesday. “Our effort [is] taking the easy way out instead of getting them on the ground. Our run game is built on cutting people and we go into the game like that and they rarely did it at all.”
Senior center Kristofer O’Dowd said the offensive line is getting back to basics and trying to correct the little things, such as leverage, helmet placement and footwork, in order to progress.
“It came down to small things like technique,” O’Dowd said. “The problem is that it’s come down to that every week, so we’re not really necessarily making progress. We’re going back to things we saw in the beginning of the year. So we have to get these little things that were supposed to be gone a month and a half ago, get those straightened out these last five games.”
O’Dowd said he thought Kiffin’s comments were fair and are a chance for the line to prove itself.
“That’s the head coach and I’m sure that’s what he saw,” O’Dowd said. “I’m all behind him. It’s just an opportunity to step up and get better, which we need to do.”
So, the inability of that great lineup of runners to get freed up is being laid at the doorstep of the offensive line?  Seems right, sounds right.  Prove it.

The USC men’s tennis team will head across town today to take part in what will be many players’ final official tournament of the semester.
Six Trojans will participate in the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships at the Los Angeles Tennis Center — the home of the UCLA Bruins — where 11 other schools will participate, including UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Pepperdine, University of Denver, Brigham Young University, Loyola Marymount, UC San Diego, Concordia University, UC Irvine, UC Riverside and Azusa Pacific University.
Five Trojans will participate in the singles main draw: No. 1 seed junior Daniel Nguyen, No. 4 seed senior Jaak Poldma, senior Peter Lucassen, freshman Raymond Sarmiento and sophomore JT Sundling.
Powering up · Junior Daniel Nguyen, USC’s No. 1 singles player, will join four other Trojans in the singles portion of the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships on Wednesday. The tournament is held at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
In the doubles portion, USC coach Peter Smith will continue to switch the lineups with pairs that have not played together extensively in competitions.
“With doubles, I’m always trying new things,” Smith said. “I’m never satisfied with the status quo.”
Nguyen will team up with Sarmiento as the No. 2 seed, Poldma will play with Sundling as the No. 3 seed, and Lucassen and freshman Michael Grant will start play in the qualifying draw.
Although USC’s attendance at the tournament is optional, the team said it relishes the opportunity to play against tough competition.
“This is another chance to play more matches,” Smith said. “It is important to take good results into the break. We want to translate good practice habits onto the courts.”
USC took a slightly unorthodox approach to preparing for the tournament. In addition to some good plays on the practice courts, the Trojans took part in a beach workout, including a competitive pickup soccer game.
Poldma said he believes that translating good results from the practice court this week will be important, especially when the team’s younger players take to the court of their crosstown rivals for the first time.
“It’s good for some of the guys — especially the freshmen — to play there before the UCLA match,” Poldma said.
One of the newcomers, Grant, has experienced some success as a Trojan already — he won the consolation bracket of the ITA Southwest Regionals last week. The freshman said that his transition to the Trojan lineup has been what he had hoped it would be.
“So far it’s been pretty fun,” Grant said. “I came here for the best tennis program in the nation. It’s been what I expected it to be — fun and competitive.”
As a junior player, Grant played in Europe, and he said that environment has helped him adjust to college tennis.
“I try not to become overconfident, but I have won a lot of matches, which has helped me,” he said.
The Trojans have definitely not exceeded expectations during the individual season, but facing some adversity is important before the intensity ratchets up during the dual match season, Smith said.
“They have had their butts kicked a little bit this semester, which has been good for us,” Smith said. “It’s good for us to focus on the future because the hangover of being two-time national champions is much more severe than from one year ago.”

Since 2006, the Echo Curio Curiosity Shop and Art Gallery has hosted experimental all-ages shows in its living room-sized storefront on a popular Echo Park strip of Sunset Boulevard.
But earlier this month, the privately owned community space known for its support of the freaky, demented and avant-garde side of Eastside culture was unceremoniously shut down by the Los Angeles Police Department, which cited the gallery-turned-venue for not having the proper entertainment permits.
The raid — which followed in the footsteps of a vice squad crack down on Echo Curio’s bring-your-own-booze policy last August — puts the important underground space in the same position as other prolific Los Angeles venues that ended up on the LAPD’s bad side, raising issues of enforcement that are ever-present for those creating and consuming music on the fringes of traditional media.
Though hardly low-key — shows filled with brown-bagging artistic types consistently flood the area’s main drag — the venue is one of many that have operated under the radar to provide a space for those contributing to the anti-mainstream musical identity in this city.
Similar to infamous Hollywood punk club The Masque, which was closed down for building violations in 1978, and the Sun Valley bowling-alley-cum-hardcore venue Godzilla — closed in 1982 after spending money on redecorating instead of permits — Echo Curio is the epicenter of an up-and-coming music movement, one ignored by established venues with expensive permits.
By allowing these community centers to thrive for years before suddenly enforcing live music permits or building codes, the LAPD effectively puts an end to built-up eras of expressive freedom, which one could infer is its intention judging by the arbitrary nature of these raids.
Take, for example, the PCH Club in Wilmington, Calif. From 1997 to 2000, the venue held drug-and-alcohol-free shows featuring bands such as Modest Mouse, Jimmy Eat World and Botch without any interference from the city.
Owner Alex Maciel said officers made numerous site visits to his establishment and never asked him about permits. A music scene flourished around the tiny stage on an industrial strip of Pacific Coast Highway until a reporter from the South Bay Weekly, a community paper of the Los Angeles Times, wrote to the Harbor Vice Division questioning the club’s legality, resulting in an investigation that abruptly shut down operations.
For the original Koo’s Café in Santa Ana — which held concerts without a permit for almost eight years because of its non-profit status — all it took were some impulsive threats of citation from the police department to get the volunteer-staffed coffeehouse and cultural hub to move.
And in the unfortunate case of Echo Curio, the LAPD started looking more closely at the space after a loud night of bass-and-guitar drone improvisations by local experimental composers garnered complaints from neighbors.
The solution to these types of raids seems like it should be easy: If a venue is cited for not having the proper permits, then the owner needs to go to the LAPD and apply for it, right?
As Echo Curio’s owners Justin McInteer, Grant Capes and Tim and Heather Goodwillie have found out in the last month, however, bureaucracy is never that straightforward.
According to Echo Curio’s blog, the space that has given some of Los Angeles’ most-loved experimental acts such as Pocahaunted, Magic Lantern and Random Patterns a stage to call home is only zoned for retail and is therefore ineligible for entertainment permits.
With this news, it looked like the gallery, curiosity shop and sometimes venue was going to throw in the towel and bow to the city’s threats by closing at the end of the year.
But on Friday, a post appeared on its blog that explained a new plan to add a tea room, apply for re-zoning permits and hope for the triumphant return of the music-minded community space.
On one hand, Los Angeles needs venues such as Echo Curio to run events with a devil-may-care attitude in order for cultural progress to be made without interference from government, but the unfortunate truth is that at some point, these idealistic projects will outgrow themselves and cooperation with the city becomes a must.
To continue its influence on the Eastside community, Echo Curio will have to cooperate with the same system that its events are speaking out against and, like its Downtown counterpart The Smell, abide by the rules. If not, it will be lifted into the pantheon of other long-lost open-minded venues that — even if it was only for a brief moment — gave the weird, the wonky and the off-beat Angelenos a safe place to hang.

Thank you for the kind words.  And the statements of the obvious, D-Man… nobody is claiming martyrdom… we had a good run, and will be back hopefully, legally holding concerts and other events….  Only one note, the show that got busted by the cops was one of the quietest shows we had had in recent times…
I hate to break it to you, but the fact is…. If you follow the rules FIRST (get your permits and zoning authorizations) you don’t have the problem later. This only happens when you try to get away with not doing what any business owner knows needs to be done. Just because you got away with it for years, doesn’t mean you aren’t going to get caught sooner or later… so stop playing at being a martyr, you pi**ed your neighbors off and they got tired of it. You took your chance and you got caught. Learn to deal with the real world.
Yup.
With the loss of the UNKNOWN THEATER earlier this year and CRANES TAVERN closing up after tonight the spaces that endeavor to support this kind of local music are disappearing. Thank you, Sarah, for pointing out that this has been the struggle for every generation of those who seek the real heart of rockNroll and experimental music. This is nothing new, folks, it’s just the lay of the land.
And thanks to the people who rise up and offer their spaces (and take their chances) so that the rest of us have the opportunity to play or hear this stuff.

If you haven’t been to the University Village since the epic 12-for-$1 Superior Grocers cucumber sale or the tragic closing of Elegance, chances are you won’t know about the newest eatery — Corcovado Brazilian Grill.
Mention Brazilian barbecue and the most common image is a meat feast with platters of beef and plates of juicy fowl. Corcovado has plenty of meat, but it is far more than a den for the hungry carnivore. It is also one of the best-priced and vegetarian-friendly places near campus.
Located in the international food court of the University Village, Corcovado looks like all the other somewhat-questionable eateries where convenience rules over food quality. Don’t be fooled.
Mimi Honeycutt | Daily Trojan
The immediate eye-catchers at Corcovado’s are not slabs of meat but fresh, interesting salads. Think of a very pared down Lemonade. Some of the standouts include a cold chicken, carrot and potato salad; a tangy crab salad; and a refreshing Greek salad. Lovers of cilantro will be happy, as the herb is sprinkled on everything from potato salad to tabuli.
Some might be surprised by the vegetable-heavy menu of this Brazilian grill. Actually, the veggies are part of the authenticity. Brazil, as an agricultural society, has a respect for pure vegetables that rivals its love of good meat.
Some might also be surprised at dishes such as chicken stroganoff and tabuli — dishes not commonly imagined as South American fare. Again, the owners of Corcovado wanted to show off Brazil’s true self, not a stereotypical view of the country, and that it includes meals inspired by its immigrant populations.
Next up are the hot side dishes. They include braised collard greens, steamed rice and black beans with sausage. Again, Corcovado knows its plant food. The collard greens are pleasantly chewy and bitter instead of typical food court veggie mush, while the black beans are smoky and filling.
An unusual standout is the creamy chicken stroganoff, which is a must-have for a rainy day. The fried yucca and polenta wedges will satisfy a fry craving, but the other side dishes are far more interesting. Everything can be topped with a sprinkle of farofa, a savory, nutty flour made from yucca.
But when it comes to the centerpiece meat, Corcovado delivers. Gristly, cheap cuts of beef? Think again. Corcovado is even careful about how it freezes the meat, to protect the flavor and texture.
The chef is a native Brazilian from Rio de Janiero and serves up a variety of meats to soothe the savage meat eater. Corcovado’s most popular and best-tasting meat dish is the picanha, a sirloin cap marinated for days until it’s soft enough to melt in your mouth. And don’t be scared off by the red meat — sirloin is one of the leanest meats on the cow.
Chicken is never dull when it comes wrapped in bacon, as it is at Corcovado. The crisp and salty bacon covers the dryness that comes from white-meat chicken breast. For more rib-sticking poultry, check out the chicken drumsticks — old fashioned drumsticks roasted on a skewer until they are rich and juicy.
The third kind of meat at Corcovado’s is Linguiça,  an authentic Brazilian sausage with a spice that is obvious on first bite and sinks into the natural sweetness of the pork.
One of the best things about Corcovado’s menu is the importance of the actual ingredients — for example, the restaurant uses oil as a tasteful flavor enhancer instead of a cover for poor-quality meat and vegetables. Likewise, condiments such as mayonnaise play second fiddle to the veggies, and fresh herbs do more than the dried kind ever can. The dishes will not bring about culinary rapture, but they are tasty, interesting and fresh, and well above much of its food court competition.
For impoverished college students living off Top Ramen, Corcovado also offers one of the best deals near campus. After 6 p.m., celebrate happy hour, where the grill becomes an all-you-can-eat buffet, including the meats, for just $9.99. Outside of happy hour, side dish-only meals are $6.99 per pound; meat-and-side dish combos are $7.99 per pound; and a Churrasco-style meat platter is $11.99 per pound.
Those expecting a lunch at Fogo de Chão’s are setting the bar a little high. But anyone looking for a filling meal at a reasonable price that leaves one feeling warm and satisfied instead of teetering on the edge of a food coma, check out Corcovado.

Smooth, sexy-voiced Norah Jones is back for her fifth studio album, …Featuring, proving her unusual ability to mesh well with every genre.
Her album will be released Nov. 16, but starting Monday, Nov. 1, a new Jones video vignette highlighting a collaboration from the new album will be posted online every day.  Based on these previews, Jones seems to be coming back strong, providing the same sultry vocal strength but this time with a surprising jazz, country, rock and hip-hop influence.
Since the success of her first album, Come Away with Me, released in 2002, Jones has provided listeners with Grammy-winning albums for the past eight years.
This time, however, with the help from EMI’s Blue Note Records, Jones reveals a different side of herself not demonstrated in other albums by collaborating with several different artists.
…Featuring presents 18 compilations of Jones’ music over the past decade, including tunes she recorded in 2001 before she became a hit. Each song on the album features Jones and other individual artists or bands, such as Ray Charles, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, the Foo Fighters, OutKast and others.
The album is definitely worth buying to hear this different side of Jones working with other many legendary artists successfully. Although it might be surprising to find out that Jones is the artist behind the album, what with the unexpected genre changes that occur from song to song, her contagious passion exists more so than ever.
…Featuring seems to focus on the other artists instead of Jones, with her powerful vocals used only as accompaniment. The songs are intriguing and easy to enjoy, but there is not much fluidity from one song to the next, making it nearly impossible to choose just one genre for the album.
Although this could make it difficult to choose an appropriate time to listen to the entire album, the unpredictably of it all has the potential to keep listeners’ ears glued to their speakers through all 18 tracks.
On a first listen of the album, it somewhat resembles the folksy and foxy tunes of Break Up, Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson’s collaborative album from last year. Although the two albums differ in genres, with Break Up having a much more happy-go-lucky feel, Jones and Johansson could easily be mistaken for one another vocally.
This multi-genre album begins with an upbeat and quick piano introduction with The Little Willies featuring Jones in “Love Me.” The duet exudes passion and will send you out of your seat to assume the fox trot while enjoying the ambiance in a ’50s diner.
The melody is smooth and works well with what sounds like a choir accompanying Jones in the background.
“Virginia Moon”  features Jones and the Foo Fighters singing together in perfect sync reciting, Virginia Moon, I wait for you tonight. Listeners might find their hips subconsciously swaying to the beat of the tunes, but they should just try to embrace it.
The album’s ninth track, “Life is Better,” is a beautiful rendition recorded with Q-Tip as the two of them mix rap and Jones’ soft high and low pitch voice together. Jones’ soft tunes work perfectly alongside the hip-hop and rap style of Q-Tip.
If anyone missed the passion and style of Ray Charles’ music, fear not, because the duet between Jones and Charles is one that should not be overlooked, even though it’s near the end of the album. Charles and Jones bring listeners back to the good old days of soul music, proving that Jones will let no genre stand in her way of providing great music for the public to enjoy.
The album concludes with an alternative-styled “Blue Bayou,” featuring M. Ward. The slow tunes unite country, guitar and very different pitches into one entity of bliss. Again, don’t look past the tracks at the bottom of the album.
For anyone going to listen to the album, don’t expect the same Jones that many have relied on for the past eight years. Her previous four albums feature similar sounding tunes that pinpointed Jones with her reliable and rugged voice.
However, for all the Jones fans out there, don’t miss this album. It is different than the others, but Jones continues to send those warm sensations running up and down your spine that come naturally while listening to this many-Grammy-winning award artist. Jones, who might have been considered a one-woman-show in her previous albums, proves her ability to successfully mesh well with pretty much every other genre.
Although the album is different, Jones’ passion still prevails.

Check in with the Daily Trojan tonight as we update you on the latest results from today’s statewide elections as they become available.  Results will be refreshed every 15 minutes.
8 p.m.: Polls are now closed in California, and early results should start coming in soon.
On campus, we’ve heard of some troubles at a few polling stations, primarily Marks Tower. Like in past elections, it seems as though students who were registered had to vote by provisional ballot anyway. We’ll keep you posted on those developments as we learn more.
On the national scene, several major media outlets are projecting that Republicans will win the House of Representatives, as Republicans have picked up several key seats in races across the country.
We’ll be updating every 15 minutes with the latest poll results, and as soon as winners are declared.
8:10 p.m.: Fifteen minutes might have been a bit ambitious. Several outlets are projecting Democrats Jerry Brown and Barbara Boxer to win the gubernatorial and senatorial seats, respectively. The Los Angeles Times, Fox News and Reuters have all jumped on board.
8:18 p.m. Returns are trickling in for candidates across the state, but nothing on the propositions yet. The Los Angeles Times has a good compilation of state results for California races and so does CNN if you want to see the numbers for all of the races.
8:30 p.m. Though no decisions have been finalized, per the L.A. Times, as of this time, Proposition 19 is failing, 57 percent to 43 percent (161,765 votes to 121,523). Two percent of precincts have returned results. Proposition 23 is also failing, 57 percent to 43 percent (113,429 votes to 84,192). One percent of precincts are reporting.
8:45 p.m. In other races across the state:
Democrat Gavin Newsom is leading the lieutenant governor’s race over Republican Abel Maldonado by 3 percent with 10 percent of precincts reporting, 596,407 votes to 559,571.
Democrat Debra Bowen is leading Republican Damon Dunn in the secretary of state race, 51 to 41 percent, with 10 percent of precincts voting. 639,064 votes to 512,760.
Republican Steve Cooley is leading Democrat Kamala Harris in the attorney general’s race, 50 percent to 41 percent, with 8 percent of precincts reporting. 462,028 votes to 384,102.
8:53 p.m. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that exit polls indicate Proposition 19, the ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana for those over the age of 21, will not pass.
9:04 p.m. Though it’s still up in the air, CNN is projecting that the Democrats will retain control of the Senate, despite the five seats the Republicans have already gained.
9:09 p.m. Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, just released the following statement congratulating Boxer on a win:
“Congratulations to Senator Barbara Boxer on a well earned victory tonight.  Despite the millions of dollars national Republicans sunk into this race, Senator Boxer’s tenacity and hard-work carried the day once again.  Senator Boxer’s victory tonight is not only a victory for California’s middle-class families, but Democrats and progressives around the country, who have a true fighter in California’s junior Senator.  I look forward to working with Senator Boxer for years to come, as we continue to fight for the values we as a party hold so dear.”
9:17 p.m. The L.A. Times has projected the same thing as CNN — that the Republicans will take the House, but the Democrats will maintain control of the Senate.
Yeah, howard, the title “California statewide election results” gives no clue that this blog is “California centric”.
Not one Republica victory reported on this blog….really non-partisan reporting guys.
See the Attorney General race.  What a dumb comment… were they supposed to make up results in the top races so that it appeared more Republicans had won?   You’ve been watching too much Faux news…
Not everyone who finds this page via Google will realize that this page is California centric.  Maybe instead of assuming that the other guy is an idiot, you can point out that the Daily Trojan is hosted by the University of Southern California and is reporting the Democratic wins in California.  
But I suppose it’s more gratifying to be anonymously derogatory.

I haven’t seen Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back in theaters since the re-release back in 1997. I was in the third grade then, and to say that Star Wars blew my mind would be the understatement of the century.
Much has changed in the decade since, but my love of the corporate monolith that is Star Wars has never faded.
Just in case you haven’t heard, USC’s School of Cinematic Arts is holding a special screening of The Empire Strikes Back this Friday at Norris Cinema Theatre as part of a special advance screening of the documentary Industrial Light and Magic: Creating the Impossible. The documentary takes a look at the visual effects company and its history of innovation since the 1970s.
I don’t know about you, but giant wookies couldn’t keep me away.

President Barack Obama told Los Angeles radio station KPWR listeners that his agenda would be “all at risk” if the Republicans were to take control of the government in Tuesday’s elections.
The Republicans are aiming for at least 218 senate seats — the number needed for the majority — in key races in California, Nevada, Washington, Colorado and Pennsylvania.
Obama said it was essential to get the vote out.
“We need to keep moving forward, that’s why I need folks to vote today,” he said.
He also said the health care reform bill would face significant obstacles if Republicans were to gain control of the senate.
“Across the board, things have gotten better over the last two years,” Obama said on KPWR. “The question is, can we keep that up? But we can only keep it up if I’ve got some friends and allies in Congress and in the state houses.”
Obama also spoke at several other radio stations Tuesday to rally votes across the nation.

From 220 miles above Earth, three American astronauts voted in today’s election from the International Space Station.
U.S. Army Col. Douglas Wheelock, Shannon Walker and Navy Capt. Scott Kelly voted on ballots created by officials in Texas that were sent up to the spaceship from Mission Control.
In 1997, Texas passed a law allowing astronauts to vote in elections from space.
“I voted on Sunday through an electronic e-mail system,” Kelly told Space.com via video conferencing. “It felt like an honor and privilege to exercise our rights as U.S. citizens from the International Space Station.”
The astronaut’s ballots are beamed back to Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center and delivered to their respective county clerk’s offices.

Last weekend the Trojans gained progress on the recruiting front for the future of their basketball program.
High school seniors Byron Wesley, a 6-foot-5 senior forward from Etiwanda, and 6-foot-1 point guard Alexis Moore of Long Beach Poly were among the recruits visiting last weekend.  Both players are currently verbally committed to the Trojans for the recruiting class of 2011.  Wesley is ranked by ESPN as a four-star prospect while Moore is rated a three star prospect.
In addition to those recruits, several others are considering signing with USC once they become seniors next year, including forward Zena Edosomwan from North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, shooting guard Gabe York of Orange Lutheran, forward Grant Jarrett of La Verne Lutheran, forward Xavier Johnson of Santa Ana Mater Dei and point guard Jahmel Taylor of Sierra Canyon.
The possibility of adding all these players from an already impressive recruiting class from 2010 has positioned the Trojans, who were recently picked to finish sixth in the Pac-10, in the right direction to move forward.
