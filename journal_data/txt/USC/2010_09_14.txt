The No. 4 USC men’s water polo team has had quite a first week of the season. The Trojans have reeled off four consecutive victories to begin the year, including wins over No. 8 Loyola Marymount and No. 10 Long Beach State. The wins kept USC undefeated in the MPSF and extended the team’s home winning streak to 36 games.
To cap the week off, junior goalie Joel Dennerly was named MPSF Player of the Week after recording 22 saves over USC’s two ranked opponents.
The announcement marked the fifth time that Dennerly has earned MPSF Player of the Week honors, and the first time that a Trojan has earned conference honors so far in the 2010 season.
Dennerly put together a solid performance in the Trojans’ home opener against Long Beach State at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, recording a season-high 12 saves, nearly twice his average while allowing only four goals to a team that averaged eight coming in to the match. He also stopped three of five power-play opportunities.
The next day against LMU, Dennerly picked up ten saves in the cage and did not allow the Lions to score in the second half.
The junior from Chester Hill, Australia is now seventh on the Trojans’ all-time saves list, with 440 career stops.
Dennerly and the Trojans will attempt to continue their impressive start to the season this weekend at the NorCal Tournament in Berkeley, Calif.

To bike or not to bike? The debate rages on.
Almost a month into the fall semester, the bicycle policy still remains a hot topic of conversation among those that navigate the stream of student traffic on a daily basis.
Last month, returning students found themselves in a for a rude awakening when their free-wheeling ways of yesteryear were forced to a screeching halt by the Department of Public Safety’s increased efforts to enforce an on-campus bicycle ban.  Many were up in arms about the rigid policy, complaining about the inconvenience of having to dismount halfway through their Tour de Class routines and the gruff treatment from DPS officers.
But, the ramped up enforcement efforts were not without cause.
The on-campus traffic during peak times is something to marvel at — pedestrians, skateboarders, service carts, bicyclists and even the occasional scooter operator fight for space on the school’s pathways every day.  The situation is exacerbated by the multitasking that each one of these individuals takes part in mid-transit.
What results is a game of human Frogger in which everyone is volunteered to be a participant.
According to Department of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton, more than 100 cases of traffic conflicts occurred in the last year and a half, ranging from minor scratches to overnight stays in the hospital. One student has already been hit by a vehicle this year.
In fact, Drayton said DPS is considering stationing a law enforcement officer at major intersections to document any traffic violations as a way to curb the reckless patterns of bicycle traffic on campus.
Taking both sides of the debate into consideration, we want to know:
What changes should be made to the on-campus bike policy?
—–
What do you think? Add your two cents to the conversation by submitting a comment in the entry form below.
I think eventually bike lanes would probably be the only reasonable solution, but if people are riding bikes to get to class faster, they would probably just ignore them and do whatever it took to get to class on time. In the short term, as much as it was annoying to have to walk my bike across intersections and get off and get back on, it didn’t really add too much time to the commute so I wouldn’t mind too much if that continued to be the case for now.
Just create lanes or force bikers to move to the right of walkways.  Or just ban them altogher except like on the back roads of campus… Everyone can easily make it from one end of campus to another in under ten minutes… I do it 3x a week …. If you can’t make it from kap to popovich hall in under 10 get your out shape self  to the Lyon center and quit crying about dps telling you to be repectful of pedestrians
guided lanes is exactly right. that’s what we need!
Just build tunnels for people to travel across campus. Others schools have them in case of snow. I mean, if we have the money why not right?
The problem in my opinion with the way bikes ride on campus is a lack of infrastructure and guided lanes. Pedestrians, bikers, and skateboarders all share a common walk area; this not only produces unneeded traffic but a ton of safety issues. The solution to this problem could be solved by painting conspicuous bike lanes. The major walkways on campus are wide enough to allow pedestrian walking and biking to coexist. Banning bikes is not the answer; creating a safe environment while keeping students interests in mind is.
Creating pedestrian-only zones in the core of campus with large amounts of bike parking around the edges of campus can be an acceptable solution if, and only if, it is augmented with dedicated bicycle infrastructure from one parking area to the next and strong bicycle connections to the existing and planned bicycle facilities in the surrounding community.  If space is going to be removed for bicycles, corresponding space needs to be created exclusively for bicycles.  If there is useful, convenient, and safe infrastructure for bicycles on campus, DPS won’t need to police the movement of bicycles in the way they are required to now with their current bicycle ban, allowing the university to redirect those resources and work hours elsewhere to more deserving needs.
I don’t think an on-campus bicycle ban will work because students are busy and need a fast way to get to class. I didn’t have a bike for a week or so and I would have to leave 30 minutes before my class just to walk there in time, and I live three blocks from campus. It would really be inconvenient for students. I think the most DPS can do right now is force students to walk their bikes in the intersection and possible down Trousedale since it’s the most crowded in that area. DPS only has so many resources though, and it’s really hard to regulate students walking their bikes at all hours of the day.

The fourth-annual Campus Safety Awareness Fair will take place today on the University Park Campus in celebration of National Campus Safety Awareness Month.
The fair, hosted on Trousdale Parkway near Tommy Trojan from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., will provide students, faculty and staff with information regarding safety during natural disasters, robberies, crimes and sexual assaults.
“[There are a] range of things for people to become better acquainted with how safety relates to them, especially for people who aren’t familiar with what it means to live in Southern California,” said Charlie Lane, associate senior vice president of Career and Protective Services. CPS co-sponsored the event with the USC Staff Assembly and the Department of Public Safety.
In response to the major earthquake warning from scientists, Bill Regensburger, director of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning, said this year’s fair is the perfect opportunity for the USC community to learn how to respond to such a natural disaster.
“Our goal is to make sure every student is safe,” Regensburger said. “We’re really trying this year to get people passing by to pass by and learn what to do … You at least need to know what to do when an earthquake happens.”
An earthquake simulator at the fair will give students, especially those who have never experienced an earthquake before, the opportunity to feel the effects of an earthquake, Regensburger said.
There will be 30 to 40 exhibits at the fair, including booths such as the Los Angeles Police Department, California Highway Patrol, USC Center for Women and Men, USC Campus Cruiser and Ready America.
Emergency preparedness kits and fire extinguishers will also be available for purchase.
“On a normal day, if somebody gets injured, you call 911, but after a major emergency 911 will be busy; 911 will not be available,” Regensburger said. “Everybody needs to be prepared. If your roommate is injured, you’re going to be the one to help them survive until help survives.”

The backgrounds of this year’s California gubernatorial candidates will play prominent roles — both good and bad — in the election, as discussed by panelists at the first Students Talk Back session, a weekly event hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, on Tuesday
Panelists, including Chief Deputy Mayor of Los Angeles Jay Carson, who was formerly a senior adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, and Matt Klink, executive vice president of Cerrell Associates, an independent public relations firm, discussed the ongoing election campaigns run by gubernatorial candidates Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman.
Jonathan Brebner, president of the USC College Democrats, and Emily Schrader, from the USC College Republicans, were also on the panel.
Carson said the candidate most likely to win the election would be the one who succeeds in convincing California voters that he or she is the most capable of solving the state’s current fiscal crisis.
“This is an election where California voters, whether they can debate about the economy or not, [they] know we’re in trouble. Voters are very, very smart,” Carson said. “The one who will win this election is the one who can best sell himself or herself as the one who can fix this situation.”
Some of the panelists also agreed that both candidates must distance themselves from the negative aspects associated with their backgrounds: Brown’s long-term tenure in politics and Whitman’s career as the chief executive officer of a large corporation.
“Both of the candidates are too far on one pole or the other,” Carson said. “One has spent their entire career in a system that is broken, one has spent no time in it at all. Their actual bios are tough to sell in this election.”
Brebner agreed the candidates need to build campaigns that steer away from their backgrounds.
“They come from two very different backgrounds. [Whitman] has decades of public service, and there’s a mood against high-level corporate types, and Brown will have to disassociate himself from being a political insider,” Brebner said.
Schrader, however, argued that Whitman’s background is not necessarily a point against the former eBay CEO.
“Yes, it can be a disadvantage to be a big, rich CEO,” Schrader said. “But [CEOs are] not to blame for the unemployment rates. She has a lot of experience creating jobs.”
Klink said he believed that criticism of Whitman’s excessive campaign spending was unnecessary.
“Meg Whitman is doing what she needs to do as the proverbial outsider,” Klink said. “If she didn’t have her personal resources, she would have lost in the primary elections.”
The panelists also spent time discussing the merits of both campaigns — or lack thereof.
“I think that the Brown campaign has been a bit slow out of the gate,” Carson said. “It’s like a boxing match. If you start to exert energy right away … you’re getting hit longer, you lose more energy. With limited resources [like Brown], you have to know when to start throwing punches.”
Brebner said he is confused about Brown’s campaign strategy, but remains hopeful for the candidate.
“It’s been rather frustrating. I’m not sure if it’s a purposeful strategy or if he’s waiting for another round. [Whitman has] been saturating the airwaves with ads since the primaries,” Brebner said. “It’s remarkable that against a $100-million campaign; he’s only behind by a couple of points.”
Alexa Ekman, former president of the USC College Republicans, said she found the panel enlightening, though she was disappointed by the areas discussed.
“There was more emphasis on their careers,” Ekman said. “But no one’s giving any attention to the fact that [Whitman] could be the first female governor.”
The panel was moderated by Dan Schnur, chair of the California Fair Political Practice Committee, and Kate Mather, editor in chief of the Daily Trojan.

In an effort to focus more on student interests and campus events, Trojan Vision Television will air a new live talk show beginning Sept. 27.
On air · Polina Diaz, a freshman majoring in screenwriting, works at the Trojan Vision studio. The station will debut a new show later this month. - Shabnam Ferdowsi | Daily Trojan 
The Daily SCene will be hosted by two anchors and will feature a variety of segments geared toward the USC student body. The segments range from interviews with USC professors and special guests, music and movies reviews, ideas for Los Angeles-based activities and coverage of entertainment news.
James Creech, a junior majoring in political science and cinema-television production and Trojan Vision’s general manager, said the idea for a daily talk show came from Elizabeth Daley, dean of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, and Don Tillman, executive director of Trojan Vision.
“We really wanted to bring a new inspiration in programming to the station,” Creech said.
The show will air from 11 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, and features two different anchors each day throughout the week. In addition, some programming segments will air on certain days of the week. The Daily SCene will broadcast live from the television kiosk near Tommy Trojan every Wednesday, a first for Trojan Vision.
Lipson said she hopes this presence on campus will help publicize The Daily SCene and Trojan Vision as a whole.
Trojan Vision had the capacity to launch the new show this semester after receiving record-breaking enrollment numbers — more than 100 people in Practicum in Television Production (CTPR 409). The course, which is required for some film majors, allows students to work directly with Trojan Vision to plan and produce daily programming.
“We had a lot of resources in terms of people that wanted to work for Trojan Vision as well as gear and equipment that we wanted to be able to use in a creative new way,” said Elle Lipson, a junior majoring in cinema-television production and the executive producer of The Daily SCene.
One way the production team plans on bolstering support for The Daily SCene, as well as its other shows, is by involving the student body through social networks.
“We’re trying to get started with a viewer-generated content segment where we’d have people [be] able to give their feedback over Twitter or Facebook,” Lipson said.
In addition, all episodes will be posted on the Trojan Vision website with additional special features, such as deleted scenes.
So far, the show has generated interest from students — currently more than 40 producers work on the team with even more crew members.
“We have a ton of volunteers and people who are just really excited,” said Olivia Bonin, a junior majoring in neuroscience and cinema-television critical studies and the promotions manager for Trojan Vision.
Overall, the show’s producers have said they are excited to launch Trojan Vision’s latest project.
“The general reaction has been very positive because they like that there is so much variety offered in the show and so much opportunity to really gear it to what students would like to see,” Lipson said.

A new budget was approved during Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, giving $30,000 to USC’s USG. The funds were provided by USC Student Affairs.  
USG received the money two weeks ago, but the Allocations Committee met four times to discuss the changes that would be made to the budget. The new budget passed by a vote of 11-0 Tuesday, with one member abstaining.
Big money - The Undergraduate Student Government voted 11-0 to approve a new budget plan, allocating $30,000 from Student Affairs. - Hayden Bennet | Daily Trojan
The branch of USG that received the most money was the Discretionary Board, which gives money to student organizations to fund events on campus.
“The discretionary fund is bigger than some of the other funding boards because it encompasses a wider range of possible events so there are more students that can qualify to get funding that way,” USG Senior Director of Communications Elizabeth Trower said.
The administrative branch of Program Board received $3,000 to cover basic costs such as paperwork, supplies, posters and shirts. The Performing Arts Committee of Program Board received $7,500, which will possibly go toward another event or bringing in more high-profile talent to perform at USC.
“They always have really well-attended events,” USG Speaker Pro Tempore and Greek Senator Mikey Geragos said. “So we thought students would really appreciate the money going there.”
Program Board’s Special Events Committee received $1,850, which will go toward improving the events already planned.
In previous years, the Special Events Committee had issues providing food for all the students that attended.
Another segment of Program Board that will receive an increase in funding is the Queer & Ally Student Assembly. A $2,000 increase will be allocated with the goal of having its funding more evenly match those of other assemblies.
“All their events have been so highly attended. They feel underrepresented at times,” USG President Chris Cheng said. “We want to give them more money to show our support for their community.”
The USG Student Senate Allocations Board also received an additional $800, which will go toward any specific projects the Senate is working on.
“Senate Allocations took a hit because they changed the interpretation of what Senate Allocations is there for,” Geragos said.
The administrative branch under the USG Executive Cabinet received $2,000. The increase will be used for purposes similar to Program Board’s administrative branch.
The Elections Commission received an additional $800. This money will be used to host events during USG elections, and encourage more students to run for various USG positions.
The USG legislative branch received $2,000 for projects that Senators are working on.

All the talk at practice Tuesday was about a player who currently resides in New Orleans and hasn’t played a down for the USC football team in five years.
Yet, it was almost business as usual for the Trojans.
Hurried · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and the Trojans practiced their no-huddle offense Tuesday after the set-up worked well for USC in Saturday’s win against Virginia, when the team scored twice in the formation. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
“I know you guys view this as a really big deal to this team but most people [didn’t] even know Reggie Bush. None of them were here when he was here. So it’s not as big a deal to them as you might think,” USC coach Lane Kiffin told reporters. “We didn’t even discuss it in the team meeting. The only reason I brought it up was so they weren’t surprised when [the media] asked them.”
Despite the fact that Bush has dominated the headlines for the last 24 hours, the team still practiced Tuesday — though you wouldn’t know it.
The offense worked on some no-huddle plays that it might look to incorporate into the game plan this week. The Trojans were most successful in the no-huddle against Virginia, scoring 14 out of their 17 points late in the first half. That’s something that sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said he wouldn’t mind seeing more of.
“I have experience of that in high school along these same lines,” Barkley said. “Not where we all have the wristbands and looking down but where it’s a slower-pace no huddle. I’m really comfortable with that — not that I have a preference of really wanting to do it or not — but I do feel comfortable if we were to go to that and I think we’ve been effective in it so far.”
Kiffin, however, stressed that a two-minute offense doesn’t have the same effect if it’s run before the last two minutes of the half.
“You got to remember too that if you start doing that when you’re not in the two-minute it’s a different situation,” Kiffin said. “Everyone says, ‘Well why don’t you do it more often?’ Well, the defense doesn’t play you the same way if you do it at a normal time because of the clock. They are in more of a preventive mode, but it’s something to look at.”

Junior defensive tackle Armond Armstead and redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry were both limited in practice Tuesday. Perry, who didn’t play in the Hawai’i game because of a high ankle sprain, left the Virginia game early because he said his ankle was bothering him. Armstead was injured in the Virginia game as well.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, this leaves the team very thin at defensive line. Many of the reserves don’t have much playing experience, as Kiffin didn’t use the normal seven or eight-man rotation in the first few games that most teams use to get players experience.
True freshman Christian Thomas, who was slated to play tight end just a few months ago, redshirt freshman Kevin Greene and senior Derrick Simmons, a converted defensive tackle, are players Kiffin said could see more time.
“It’s an opportunity for some different guys,” Kiffin said. “It’s good for us because it’s a reminder that this is what it’s going to be like in the next four years, so we’re getting used to it.”

The Trojans are also looking to use senior fullback Stanley Havili more this week.
Kiffin has limited Havili in his touches because there is no other scholarship fullback on the roster after D.J. Shoemate transferred to UConn over the summer.
But the Trojans’ offense stalled without the usual touches from Havili last week and Kiffin recognizes that he can’t afford to rest the senior much more.
“I never anticipated we would struggle the way we did Saturday on offense. I thought we would be able to move the ball without using him that much,” Kiffin said. “He’s a really good player. We haven’t given him the ball much and it almost backfired, besides the two-minute drill.”
Kiffin said he still hasn’t heard why redshirt junior tight end Rhett Ellison was ejected with four seconds to go in Saturday’s game, but he said Ellison has been cleared to play this week.

The No. 1 women’s golf team climbed up the leader board on the second day of the 2010 NCAA Fall Preview, but still finds itself five strokes behind No. 4 Alabama going into the final round today.

The Women of Troy are in third place at 5-under-par 571 (289-282). With three of four scoring players improving from their first round, the team is in position to make a run for first place in the final round.
“We’d like to win, but the important thing this early is to get better,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said.
The scores improved yesterday because the Women of Troy had three golfers under par, as opposed to one during the first round.
For the second day in a row, senior Lizette Salas walked away with the lowest score on the team. Salas is tied for fourth individually at 4-under-par 140 (70-70). She sits two strokes behind Marina Alex of Vanderbilt and Brooke Pancake of Alabama.
Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez finished tied for 15th at 2-under-par 142 (72-70). Four birdies helped Rodriguez overcome an early double bogey for her second under-par round of the year.
Two strokes behind Rodriguez is junior transfer Lisa McCloskey at even-par 144 (74-70). McCloskey’s two-bogey, four-birdie round propelled her into a tie for 21st, nine spots up from day one.
McCloskey sits one stroke above freshman Rachel Morris, who is tied for 24th at 1-over-par 145 (73-72). Morris started strong with back-to-back birdies on holes five and six, but undid them with a double bogey on hole nine.
Freshman Sophia Popov rounds out the roster at 7-over-par 151 (75-76), good for a tie for 54th. Two bogeys and a double bogey over a stretch of four holes proved to be Popov’s undoing in the second round of her collegiate debut.
The Traditions Golf Club in College Station, Texas is the site of the NCAA championship in May 2011. The team cannot predict the conditions it will see in May, but adjusting to the mid-90-degree heat and high humidity will be key for success. The Women of Troy have a history of success in College Station, winning an NCAA regional there in 2006.
The tournament wraps up today and the Women of Troy will go right back to work.
“We look at their stats, and see what areas need a little attention, and see what we need to work on,” Gaston said. “The only way we know what we need to work on is to play in tournaments.”

In 2008, Alex Ago faced a familiar conundrum for a film programmer ­­— he had too many movies and not enough screens.
Ago programs the weekly screening for film critic Leonard Maltin’s Wednesday night symposium at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Ago realized that the number of films he wanted to show far outnumbered the amount of films he could actually screen in class. With that in mind, he started the Outside the Box [Office] series at USC. Each week, Ago showcases films not available in a theater near you, often because they have yet to be released. They’re all free, and they’re available to anyone at USC.
The initial focus of Outside the Box [Office] was international cinema. Maltin’s class requires a speaker to accompany each film, but for foreign releases, those guests weren’t always available. These films then became the backbone of Outside the Box [Office].
Screening those films, however, meant finding the right room with the proper equipment.
“Outside the Box [Office] started as a Wednesday night program, but at the time I was limited to a theater that could not project 35mm,” Ago said. “Foreign films, for the most part, only had 35mm prints available.”
To solve the problem, Ago turned Outside the Box [Office] into a biweekly series. International films that came on a 35mm print found a home on Sunday nights, while films distributed on Blu-ray or digital video, including domestic films, screened on Wednesday nights.
“Over the years, I’ve found that there’s all sorts of stuff we can bring in,” Ago said. “Not just international cinema, but a lot of documentary cinema and a lot of independent cinema as well.”
When the School of Cinematic Arts welcomed the addition of the villa-style Steven Spielberg and George Lucas buildings, Outside the Box [Office] grew with it. Now, with the Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre, Ray Stark Family Theatre and Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre available, Ago can showcase multiple films throughout the week in both digital and 35mm formats.
An actor, director or producer of the film is present for a Q&A session after 60 to 70 percent of the screenings. Ago’s goal with Outside the Box [Office] is to screen films that — even if they are released in Los Angeles — might be difficult for students to find in theaters.
“[The ones we show] typically get released in a few theaters, frequently for a short period of time with little marketing and [are] in theaters that are frequently on the other side of town,” Ago said. “I thought it would be great to actually bring them to campus.”
Outside the Box [Office] has featured films from about 30 different countries, Ago said, attracting a variety of audiences.
“When you screen an Indonesian film or a Filipino film and you get a room full of USC Indonesian students that’s sort of exciting because it’s saying there’s something for all,” Ago said. “It exposes people to different cultures, which I think is important to a liberal arts education.”
The documentaries, including the suspenseful Catfish or The Lottery, which focuses on inner city schools in New York City, similarly blend broad appeal and niche audiences.
“Documentaries often have a great interest with very specific groups because there is subject matter being discussed that has relevance to all kinds of cross-campus departments or student organizations,” Ago said. “We’re doing a screening of Crude that examines some very interesting legal and ethical issues, so that’s something we think the law students and the business students and potentially the journalism students might be interested in.”
There’s even room for cult hits, like the 1990 classic Troll 2, which ran back-to-back with Best Worst Movie, the documentary chronicling the strange journey of Troll 2. Best Worst Movie director and Troll 2 star Michael Stephenson was even present for the screening.
“The films we’ve brought in are all offering something unique,” Ago said. “I don’t ever feel like something wasn’t worth doing. Even when something is not a masterpiece, it’s got something about it that really was worth your time, whether it’s the kind of story it’s telling, the culture it’s exposing you to or the subject matter of a documentary that might open your eyes to something you haven’t thought of our didn’t know about.”
For a full schedule, or to RSVP for screenings, visit cinema.usc.edu/outsidetheboxoffice. Students are allowed one guest, but come early — there’s often only standing room available.

In what is becoming an unfortunate pattern, the Obama administration — and political leadership in general —  missed an incredible opportunity last weekend.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
The past week saw the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a fiery controversy over Florida pastor Terry Jones’ proposed “International Burn a Quran Day,” and the first televised interview of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the  man behind the proposed Islamic community center near Ground Zero. Nine years ago, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center brought the West’s relationship with Islam to the center of American public discourse.
This renewed tension provides a chance to capitalize on the attention being paid to Islam’s place in the United States and an opportunity to create a more lasting peace. Societal turning points frequently happen when leaders step up in times of crisis. Whether it was Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s or Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, the United States’ illustrious history of leadership is the reason we have long been able to call our nation the land of the free and home of the brave.
It is during times like these that President Barack Obama, as a prominent and inspirational speaker, should emulate the heroes of the past. Unfortunately, it seems this moment will pass without a decisive display of leadership to remind us of our values. Fear of the electorate has won the day, as it has far too many times since Obama’s inauguration.
Obama should have used this week to make a major speech. The events of the week presented an opportunity to address multiple key facets of the United States’ relationship with the Islamic world.
First, Obama should have recognized that we can no longer pretend that the strained relationship between the West and the Islamic world is sustainable. Sept. 11 and countless other terrorist attacks perpetrated by Islamic radicals on Western targets demonstrate that there is a significant enough level of hatred by some in the Islamic world to pose a threat to the United States and its allies. Though the vast majority of Muslims oppose terrorist tactics and motivations, their voices are frequently drowned out by a minority that is, by definition, much more vocal and visible.
Conversely, the public needs to know that laws such as the Swiss ban on minaret construction and the success of radical anti-immigrant parties in traditionally liberal and tolerant countries — including the Netherlands and France — demonstrate that there is a growing intolerance of Islam in the West.
Recent events in the United States show the proximity of that intolerance, including the public outrage at the proposal to build an Islamic community center in Lower Manhattan and the decision of an extremist Florida pastor to sponsor a day of Quran burning on Sept. 11. The growing level of mutual distrust between many Islamic countries and the West threatens to escalate and endanger both, something Obama should not have left unaddressed.
His lack of a speech or notable public statement also left him remiss in his duty to emphasize — and capitalize on — the United States’ ability to keep its morals uncompromised. What has made America great through the years has been its faithfulness to its values even when they are most threatened. Obama should have challenged the nation to let the threat of extremism bring out the best in us once again.
Terrorism is a threat not because of the direct damage it can do, but because it can lead us astray from our values. Staying true to our values discredits Islamic fundamentalism; abandoning them strengthens it. The public often forgets that in its eagerness to decry all things Islam as radical, and as a result we undermine our patriotism.
A speech reminding the nation of this would have galvanized us, spoken to our capacity for tolerance and perhaps reminded the electorate what we loved about Obama at the beginning of his term as president.
Instead, the president sat down for a little-publicized interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in which he neither discussed the Ground Zero mosque nor addressed the greater social implications of the issue.
He did, however, offer up the following gem on Jones’ idea: “This is a recruitment bonanza for Al Qaeda. You know, you could have serious violence in places like Pakistan or Afghanistan. This could increase the recruitment of individuals who’d be willing to blow themselves up in American cities or European cities. You know and so you know, I just hope that, he says … he’s someone who is motivated by his faith. I hope he listens to those better angels.” Failing to show leadership by dodging the discussion of a large-scale social issue and instead choosing to be a scaremonger and cry national security — sounds more like “W” than Obama.
If that is the Obama team’s strategy for the next two elections, it might be time for him to find some new advisers. However, if this reflects Obama’s own instinct, to shirk the responsibilities of leadership — then it could be time for us to find a new leader.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Wednesdays.
Islam commands its followers to conquer non-Muslims in countless Koran passages.  Although Charnoff refers to the terrorists who murdered almost 3,000 innocent people on September 11, 2001 as “radicals”, they were in fact correctly practicing their religion.  Charnoff states, “Terrorism is a threat not because of the direct damage it can do, but because it can lead us astray from our values.”  Wrong, terrorism is a threat because it *kills* people.  Evidently, Charnoff does not recognize the danger posed by a religion that resents the very existence of Western civilization.  Also, he seems to believe that American values consist of “tolerating” the forces that work for its destruction, not individual rights and freedom.
Ah, Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr… two of our great, inspirational defeaters of Democrats. Boy, how I wish we had a few leaders of their caliber these days. My goodness, I think we actually do have one or two. Now, what were their names….?
Oh, Daniel, Daniel. You, unfortunately, never fail to amaze with your naivete. 
This week I got a belly laugh over this: “Terrorism is a threat not because of the direct damage it can do…”
Uh… okay. Tell that to the families left behind after 9/11. Or for that matter, the families who mourn every single day in Muslim countries because some idiot blew himself up and took out a loved one along with his own sorry virgin-seeking self.
At least his last line made sense: “It could be time for us to find a new leader.”
Yup, and we’re already looking.
From this editorial, it strikes me that the author either did not watch or did not listen to the President’s speech from the Oval Office last week. In the last and in this century, any speech by a U.S. President that originates from the Oval Office is by practice if not definition, a “Major address.” In the President’s Oval Office address last week, I heard a calm, articulate and clear message of support to not only the freedom of religious practice (as defined in the Constitution) but also to American Muslims, including those who serve in uniform. Perhaps for the author, the clarity of the President’s message got lost in the arguably ridiculous din of coverage of that “Kook” (using the President’s term) in Florida.
Daniel,
Come on, man. I realize you live in a small college world in which Obama is in fact still everyone’s savior, but an “inspirational speech” isn’t just something Obama can conjure up. Most of the nation now, just 1.5 years in, disapproves of him, while the overwhelming majority think his policies suck. Clearly he’s a likable guy, or else these numbers would be the opposite, but he’s no savior to anyone but those still blindly following wherever their political parties lead them.
Just for once, can you try to write something that’s not propaganda?

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 3-0 Tuesday approving a $1.3 million contract with Homeboy Industries, a Los Angeles based organization that provide job opportunities to young men and women to help keep them out of gangs.
Homeboy Industries, founded nearly 20 years ago, has been undergoing layoffs since the beginning of this year when charitable contributions decreased as the U.S. economy took a turn for the worse.
Yet the high demand for the program and its mission to provide positive opportunities for Los Angeles youth helped lead to Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas’ voting yes to approve the new contract.
“A premier organization that has distinguished itself by helping literally thousands of young men and women turn their lives around,” Ridley-Thomas told the Los Angeles Times. “An entity that has a national reputation for doing good ought to be aided at its time of need.”
Homeboy Industries plans to use the $1.3 million to hire 20 job trainees and provide counseling and other services to 665 probationers and other young adults at risk of incarceration, reported the L.A. Times.

There’s no doubt about it: USC has disciplinary problems on the football field.
Through two games, USC is tied with Arizona State for the most penalties, 24, in the Football Bowl Subdivision, and leads the nation in penalty yards with 240.
Coach Lane Kiffin has made this one of his top priorities over the past few weeks, after his team committed 11 penalties in its season opener against Hawai’I, but it doesn’t seem to be working. The game Saturday against Virginia reinforced that, as the Trojans committed careless penalty after careless penalty — 13 total — en route to a very unconvincing 17-14 win over a mediocre Virginia team.
“I talked about [penalties] immediately in the locker room after the game, just like I did before the game, just like I did in every team meeting [last] week, and that didn’t work,” Kiffin said. “It’s not that it won’t be noticed. It’s just that … that was my predecessor’s whole deal: Whatever you talk about, they draw towards. So maybe I screwed that one up.”
With just one more game left before the Pac-10 slate begins for USC, Kiffin has decided he is taking a different approach to try and cure the Trojans’ penalty problems.
“We’ve gone the other way with it,” Kiffin said. “Maybe our players were drawn to it because we paid so much attention to it, so we’re not going to talk about it, because it can’t get worse.”

Today marks the release of USC student Katherine Schwarzenegger’s first book, Rock What You’ve Got: Secrets to Loving Your Inner and Outer Beauty. The oldest daughter of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and a junior majoring in communication at  the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, Schwarzenegger said she felt the issue of body image was in great need of being addressed, especially after hearing girls of so many different ages worrying about their weight.
Schwarzenegger — a former intern for the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty — uses expert interviews, research and statistics in her book, which she said she hoped would provide girls a new perspective on some of the societal pressures they face.
“I never thought I would write a book,” she said in an interview with PR-Canada.net. “But my fuel came from research and information on the growing number of girls who feel so much pressure to be thin — and how young all of this is starting. My goal is to let girls know they’re not alone when they’re going through this and to spread the word about what young girls are going through today.”
“You don’t have to look like you’re on a billboard to feel beautiful,” she said. “I really wanted to correct girls’ perception of that.”

A video of the gas pipeline explosion that occurred in San Bruno, Calif. on Sept. 9 has been released, according to the Los Angeles Times.
A gas line blast killed seven people and destroyed dozens of houses after the area surrounding the pipeline was engulfed in flames.
The video, taken from a gas station nearby, shows a fireball forming and people running from the scene.
Authorities still aren’t sure what caused the pipeline to burst, though Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has stated that the line was checked regularly.
California Sen. Barbara Boxer has called on the state to provide aid to the victims of the explosion and for a thorough investigation of the incident.
So far, only four of the seven victims have been identified by coroners.
The fourth and latest identified victim was an 81-year-old widow.
Three people are still missing.

The president of the American Dental Hygiene Association has handpicked a USC senior, along with three other students from the nation, to serve on the ADHA student advisory board.

Joan Beleno, a senior majoring in dental hygiene at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, was selected because of her leadership skills and passion for ensuring patient health, said Diane Melrose, chair of the dental hygiene program at USC.
“Joan works very hard, is genuine, honest and an amazing person,” Melrose said. “Her overall character and great communication skills with individuals make her a great leader. She really wants to see our profession excel and has a real dedication to having our profession be the best.”
ADHA serves as a professional organization and the governing body for American dental hygienists, aimed at maintaining the livelihood of the profession.
Students are able to use ADHA as a connection to what is going on in the field of dentistry, what they need to know about the profession and what they need to do after graduating, Beleno said.
“The student advisory board is a group of four people from the whole nation who are the eyes and ears for the ADHA’s Committee on Student Relations,” Beleno said. “We are who the Student Relations Committee goes to and asks about student interests and concerns — we are the middlemen between the current students and ADHA.”
Beleno said she is happy to be on the ADHA board because she is able to represent USC.
“I’m really honored because I know that it is not every day that someone is able to work on the board,” Beleno said. “Being on the student advisory board also helps people know that USC has a great dentistry program and I’m looking forward to seeing the background of our profession and bringing different insights to USC.”
Beleno graduated from UC Irvine with a Bachelor of Arts in applied ecology before USC. She decided to go to USC because of the strength of the program at the School of Dentistry.
“I have always been on the dental track and dental hygiene has a lot to offer, with relationships with patients as well as working in the healthcare field,” Beleno said. “After being appointed a month ago, I’m excited to get everything situated, and hopefully this will encourage others to get involved in their legislation and with student programs so that they are aware with everything that is going on with dental hygiene.”
Members of the board meet for monthly or bimonthly conference calls to discuss upcoming issues and concerns.
Each year,  a national conference is held and the student advisory board is responsible for helping to plan the student portion of the national conference. The board also gathers guest speakers and conducts student activities.
Along with serving on the student advisory board, Beleno is president of the Student American Dental Hygiene Association at USC.
This year, Beleno participated in a table clinic/research poster session and presented at the National Dental Hygiene conference in Las Vegas. She also actively engages in community service and volunteers at AYUDA Dental Clinic offering dental treatment to children.
In the future, Beleno hopes to work in the L.A. area as a dental hygienist.

The U.S. Department of Justice recently reported that one in four college women will be victims of sexual assault by the time she graduates, though officials say that statistic might be higher than the reality at USC.
According to Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle, that number isn’t applicable to smaller communities such as USC.
In 2009, 27 cases of sexual assault were reported to DPS. In 2008, 16 cases were reported, he said.
“As you can see, with several thousand female students at the university, a claim that one in five female students are sexually assaulted is not borne out,” Carlisle said. “Of course, it is impossible to measure how many sexual assaults go unreported.”
Carlisle said it is not uncommon for victims of sexual assault to be reluctant to report it to DPS.
“We are not sure our numbers are a true reflection of the number of assaults,” he said.
DPS is required to forward all reports of sexual assault to the Los Angeles Police Department.
The USC Center for Women and Men is also called whenever an incident occurs. Danielle Lancon, director for the Center for Women and Men, said students at USC are no more or less at risk than in other communities.
“It’s just a high risk group of 18-25 year olds,” Lancon said. “Whole cultural change needs to take place about violence and sexism.”
Some communities within USC create environments that lead to more sexual assaults, however, according to Melora Sundt, associate dean for academic programs at Rossier School of Education who works with the Center for Women and Men.
“We have some of the indicators that would suggest that we would have a bigger problem here — higher levels of alcohol, relatively strong Greek life culture — not the cause of it — but when it comes to creating environments where predators can continue, you’re likely to find them there,” Sundt said.
Several groups at USC are dedicated to reducing the risk of sexual assault through education  and the encouragement of responsible behavior. USC Men Care, DPS’ Rape Aggression Defense and the Center for Women and Men are among these.
“We’re trying to work with the Greek system, doing presentations throughout the whole year, talking about risk reduction, feminism, etc. Chapters get more attention, and certain cases, like with high profile athletes, garner more attention,” Lancon said.
The best way to protect against sexual assault, Carlisle said, is to make smart decisions in party settings.
“Don’t leave a party with a stranger. Don’t walk alone off campus after dark. Take advantage of USC’s various transportation services,” he said. “Making smart decisions — such as drinking responsibly — greatly reduce a person’s chances of becoming the victim of a sexual assault.”
Sundt warns, however, that it is important to properly prepare women to proactively protect themselves from possible sexual assault without scaring them.
“You don’t want to sound like you’re blaming [the woman], but you want them to understand to be prepared,” Sundt said. “Some predators are smooth and polished … He goes out and targets victims.”
Often it’s not a case of bad communication between the predator and the victim, Sundt said, but it is a standard operating procedure for the predator to seek out vulnerable women.
“As just a woman in college, it’s upsetting to hear something like that,” said Ellen Streit, a senior majoring in neuroscience. “[But] it sounds about right, it sounds accurate.”
Streit said students new to USC might not have adapted yet to the social scene and might be more vulnerable because they are not familiar with safety practices.

The dining hall Everybody’s Kitchen received a “B” rating from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health last week, but USC administrators say they are working hard to fix the violations.

B-side · The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health inspected Everybody’s Kitchen on Sept. 9 and gave the dining hall a “B” rating. USC Hospitality said it is working to fix the violations that occurred. - Aditya Tannu | Daily Trojan
The health department conducted a facility inspection on Sept. 9 and gave the popular on-campus dining hall 81 points out of 100. Cafeterias such as EVK are inspected three to four times a year on a random basis.
“Everyone starts with 100 points. As the inspector goes through the violations that they come across, they start deducting points from 100,” said Mabel Gale, an environmental health specialist with the department.
The violations found at EVK included high refrigerator temperatures, lack of lids used on food storage, broken gaskets and dirty floors in the kitchen. Gale said most of the points deducted were because of broken gaskets that allowed the temperature in the coolers to rise higher than 41 degrees Fahrenheit, the required temperature limit.
Gale said, however, most of the violations committed were minor and did not pose a major health issue for students.
“It’s different if you have a problem with vermin, with rats, with mice,” Gale said. “The inspection is just a picture of what is going at that precise moment.”
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said he believes students should not be concerned about food safety at EVK.
“There’s no danger. If there were a danger, the health department would shut us down,” he said.
The university has paid a fee to receive another inspection in the next 14 days, and EVK will receive a new rating after the second visit from the health department.
Klinger said USC Hospitality has already begun fixing the problems that led to the “B” rating by implementing new training systems, working to fix the temperatures and ensuring more stringent audits of the kitchen.
“Students are a priority,” Klinger said. “So we’re going to get the ‘A’ back and maintain the ‘A.’”
The rating was a disappointment for the employees, Klinger said.
“It’s not a true reflection of the job that they do,” Klinger said. “They are very disappointed … They know the students well, they know everyone who comes in.”
Erica Silva, a junior majoring in political science, said she believes a “B” rating is unacceptable for a college cafeteria.
“It was really disappointing, because being at a university, we shouldn’t have to worry about the quality of our food. I think there is no excuse for them to have any kind of rating lower than an ‘A,’” Silva said.
Silva said EVK was a popular option for students with a meal plan who live in dorms on the north side of campus.
“It’s really a trek to go to Parkside,” Silva said. “For all the students in that area, [EVK is] where everybody eats. It’s kind of like your only option, especially with the meal plan.”
EVK had a rating of 94, or an “A,” before the inspection on Sept. 9. The last time the cafeteria received a “B” was in 2008.

Ride on · The USC administration is taking steps to deal with the bike traffic issue on campus and will discuss solutions at today’s forum. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
Bike safety has been an ongoing discussion in recent years, and the Undergraduate Student Government hopes the forum will provide a way for students to interact with administrators about their needs and concerns.
“We’re hoping that there will be a good turnout and that it serves a dual purpose,” said Monish Tyagi, director of  USG Campus Affairs. “We hope that it helps administrators understand student concerns and also students voice their concerns and insight.”
Department of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton said that because of the variety of transportation modes, conflict is inevitable.
“Our campus is filled with obstacles like other people, vehicles, golf carts and skateboarders, so there are a lot of traffic conflicts that can occur,” Drayton said. “A person should really focus on the task at hand.”
In the last year and a half, more than 100 cases of traffic conflicts occurred, ranging from minor scratches to overnight stays in the hospital, Drayton said. One student has already been hit by a vehicle this year.
“Students are being injured severely because they aren’t following the rules of the road,” Drayton said. “I’m not saying that they’re not aware [of the motor vehicle code] … I just don’t believe that they care because there’s not an enforcement present to make that happen on a regular basis.”
Drayton said DPS is considering stationing a law enforcement officer at major intersections to document any traffic violations.
The event will be held at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center in The Forum.
Correction: 9/15/10 — A previous version of this story was headlined “USG to host bike forum.”  However, the Campus Conversation Series is sponsored by the Office of Campus Activities.  This version of the story has been corrected to reflect this change.
