This weekend, the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team will travel to Stanford to battle in the Mountain Pacific Invitational and face off against the Air Force Falcons for the first time this season. The event will take place throughout the weekend and kick off with the Trojans playing the Falcons.   
The match against the Falcons will be the Trojans’ first major tournament of the year.  A win would put USC up against the winner of Friday’s Long Beach State vs. UC Davis game to continue group play at 8 a.m. on Saturday. 
The Mountain Pacific Invitational will kick off with the winner of Friday’s match to compete on Saturday morning and potentially move in to the semifinals at 2:40 p.m. that same afternoon, with Sunday featuring the championship game at 2:30 p.m. preceded by a 1 p.m. third-place game.
The 16-team tournament features 11 of the top 12 teams in the nation. USC will be entering the tournament as a top seed with an outstanding season overall record of 18-1 after last weekend’s devastating loss against Stanford where USC broke its 17-game winning streak. The loss to Stanford dropped USC to No. 3 in the nation.
The last time the Trojans competed against the Falcons was back in 1982. Friday’s match against the Falcons will be the 21st time in the history of the series that the opposing teams have met. At their last meeting in 2014, the Trojans defeated the Falcons, 20-7. 
USC started the season undefeated and managed to snag the No.1 position just two weeks in. The Trojans concluded their 2017 season at No. 2 in the land after reaching the NCAA final for the 13th consecutive season.
This season has not only started with a winning streak but has introduced a handful of new faces to the roster. One notable newcomer is freshman driver Hannes Daube. 
Daube’s presence in the water has not gone unnoticed. The 6-foot-5 freshman driver has recently been selected MPSF Newcomer of the Week for the third time this season. 
“Older guys, they have more experience, they help me in meetings, pregame, postgame, and give me little clues, and help me stay positive,” Daube said.
The Air Force is currently 4-9 overall this season and recently won against Santa Clara University last weekend.
Much like USC’s roster, the Falcons have notable freshmen dominating in the water. Air Force freshman goalie Anthony Tolbert made five saves and had a steal in their last match against Santa Clara. In that same match, freshman utility Henry Yavitt led the Falcons with four assists and also won all four of his sprints.
“Our defense is gonna be our main focus, not letting the center get the ball,” Daube said.

With Saturday’s USC vs. Colorado game quickly approaching, the Daily Trojan and CU Independent collaborated to obtain inside information through a conversation with sports editor Justin Guerriero.
Daily Trojan: Colorado is undefeated so far with a fairly easy schedule. How are the Buffs approaching this game compared to the others?
Justin Guerriero: Colorado has taken some significant heat on the national level from the media and fans alike for the combined 1-16 record of its opponents before last week’s matchup with Arizona State. I suppose that’s fair. But overall, the Buffaloes are prepping for USC as they would any other team. It’s business as usual. That said, I think coaches and players alike understand the toughness of playing at the Coliseum and are cognizant of Colorado having never beaten USC in program history. That very well may change come Saturday. Say what you will about the Buffaloes’ weak schedule thus far, but this Colorado team coming to L.A. on Saturday is one coming off a well-earned win over ASU last week and is ready to compete for a similar result against the Trojans. The Buffs have a lot of weapons on offense while Colorado’s defense has looked solid thus far, as well.
DT: Junior quarterback Steven Montez is ranked second in completion percentage behind Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa. What is it about him that makes the offense so productive?
JG: Steven Montez is very much a guy who was thrown into the fire as a young quarterback. In 2016, when the Buffaloes had a magical year of resurgence, finishing the year at 10-4 and making a bowl for the first time since 2005, Montez was backup to the tenured and now-graduated Sefo Liufau. In Week 3 at Michigan, Montez was called upon in the second half to lead the Buffs against the then-ranked No. 4 Wolverines after Liufau left the game with an ankle injury. Montez was far from spectacular, but in that game I think he got some jitters out of the way which allowed him, upon being named starter for the team’s Pac-12 Conference opener at Oregon the following week, to go in with confidence and lead Colorado to a major upset in Eugene.
Last year, the Buffs tailed off following the loss of nine out of 11 starters on defense and finished the season with a 5-7 record. Montez was good, but signs of growing pains were there. At times, he seemed uncomfortable in the pocket, tossed far too many balls into tight coverage and had a knack for refusing to throw the ball away in hopeless situations, resulting in major sacks and lossage of yards. That said, this season, he is displaying signs of extreme maturity. Colorado added Kurt Roper as quarterbacks coach for the season and his skills and influence on Montez are becoming increasingly apparent.
Roper told me over the summer that Montez’s work ethic and desire to get to know his receivers reminded him of how Peyton Manning operated when he was at Tennessee in the late ’90s (Roper was a graduate assistant for the Volunteers for Manning’s junior and senior seasons). Montez has gone above and beyond to establish a rapport with his wideouts. He once told me that he spent hours running routes in his apartment parking lot with Colorado senior wideout Juwann Winfree. He’s got a great arm and, with Roper’s help, is developing an ever increasing football IQ that’s allowing him to be cool in the pocket under pressure and exploit opposing teams’ defenses. Overall, his completion percentage is up 15 percent from what it was in 2017.
DT: Is Colorado’s defense going to be able to stop USC’s run game in senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware?
JG: Honestly, he very well could rush for 100 yards. Last week against the Sun Devils, Colorado’s defense struggled at times with ASU tailback Eno Benjamin, who rushed for 123 yards and found the endzone twice. But the Buffs held him to a 4.3 yards per carry average. Colorado’s defense buckled down in the second half, limiting Benjamin to 24 rushing yards in the final two quarters. The Buffaloes’ defense has solid linebackers in seniors Rick Gamboa and Drew Lewis plus sophomore standout Nate Landman, who leads the team with two interceptions and 48 tackles. Defensive lineman Mustafa Johnson has been great in 2018. His 4.5 sacks are a team-high and he’s proved adept at plugging holes and frustrating enemy running backs. I’d describe CU’s run defense as good, not great, but good enough to keep opposing tailbacks from delivering knockout blows to the team on the whole.
DT: Who are USC’s key offensive players that the Buffaloes are worried about?
JG: Freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is probably first and foremost on the list. I think he’ll be a good test for Colorado’s secondary. He strikes me as the type of guy that’s capable of elevating the game of the Trojans’ true freshman quarterback, JT Daniels, whom I respect but think could be prone to mishaps. The Buffs will certainly need to keep a tab on Ware, but also perhaps to a similar extent sophomore running back Stephen Carr. His 5.9 yards per carry average is impressive and speaks for itself. The Trojans’ running and passing plays are equal in 2018 at 169. I asked Mustafa Johnson this week about preparing for a balanced offense like USC’s and he essentially told me that he and the defense will look to shut down one element of the Trojans’ offense in the hopes of making them one dimensional.
DT: What’s your score prediction?
JG: 30-21, Colorado. I think Colorado will earn its first victory over USC on Saturday. I anticipate Colorado’s offense to outperform the Trojans on defense, and while I think the game will be close and hard fought, I believe the Buffaloes’ defense will perform well enough to limit the damage and allow Montez and Co. to hammer enough nails in USC’s coffin to ensure a win on the road.

Now halfway through Pac-12 conference play, the No. 2 women’s soccer team will head to Pullman, Wash. on Saturday to take on No. 19 Washington State.
After beating Arizona 2-0 and Arizona State 3-1 last weekend, the Trojans look to continue their winning streak and improve upon their overall record of 11-1-1. 
USC has conceded 5 goals this season, compared to scoring 36. They have outshot their opponents in all 13 matches. Aside from their loss against No. 2 Stanford on Sept. 30, the Trojans are undefeated with 10 shutouts so far. The Trojans have consistently been the first to put points on the board, dominating possession and controlling the pace of the game. They have held opponents to an average of .375 goals per game this season, the best in the Pac-12.  Redshirt sophomore goalie Kaylie Collins has seven shutouts, the most in the conference.
The Cougars (10-2-0) are coming off a two-game losing streak, their most recent loss being against Utah this past Sunday. The Utes pulled off a 1-0 upset in overtime with a converted penalty kick, handing Washington State its second loss of the season. The Cougars outshot the Utes 9-8, but could not find the back of the net for the first time this season.
Coming off two undefeated home games this season, the Women of Troy will hit the road again. 
“Anytime you go on the road into an environment … where a team is feeling confident, and they are feeling very good at home, we’ve got to make sure we lock in and really focus,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said.
Even though the Trojans beat the Cougars 2-1 in last year’s match, McAlpine said that Washington State is a strong team this season and will present a challenge.
“They can score, and they can defend, and teams like that are very dangerous,” McAlpine said.
The Trojans will prepare for competitive offensive players like Washington State junior forward Morgan Weaver, who has 7 goals this season, tied with USC’s top scorer senior forward Leah Pruitt. Weaver ranks ninth in the country with an average of 5.08 shots per game. Junior defender Maddy Haro ranks second in the nation in assists with 10 and will put up a tough offensive front against the Trojan defense under the leadership of Collins and senior defender Ally Prisock.
After a double-header weekend, the Trojans took a rest day before heading into practice to prepare for their game against the Cougars.
“Now that we are done with the weekend, we just want to take a good rest day and get recovered,” redshirt sophomore attacker Savannah DeMelo said earlier this week. “And then we want to go into practice working hard and getting ready for Washington State, because we know that they are a great opponent and it’s just going to keep our momentum going into the next [Pac-12] games.”
Saturday’s game will be broadcast on Pac-12 Network at 7 p.m.

Freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown has collected 396 yards this season and averages 15.8 yards per reception. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The 3-2 Trojans set their sights on extending their win streak after coming off their bye week as they square off with an undefeated Colorado team in the Coliseum on Saturday. USC barely made it out of Tucson with a win in their last game, after nearly surrendering a large second-half lead to the Wildcats as it racked up 18 penalties on the night. 
The Buffaloes, ranked No. 19 in the nation at 5-0, hold the top spot in the Pac-12 South — just one place above the Trojans. This game carries implications, as it’s likely that the winner finds themselves playing at Levi’s Stadium for a Pac-12 Championship come December. 
“It’s a talented team that has a lot of confidence, and every little thing we can get ahead on [will help],” head coach Clay Helton said. “Every little tool we can put in our toolbox is going to be crucial. And they walked out there and they were very business-like. [There was] very much a sense of urgency, and I was proud of them.” 
USC Offense vs. Colorado Defense
The Trojan offense has looked markedly better over the course of the last two weeks, largely thanks to the improved play of the offensive line. While it struggled against both Stanford and Texas, the line turned in steady performances over the last two games in both the run game (366 rush yards) and pass protection (three sacks allowed). 
Freshman quarterback JT Daniels and the passing game looks to be clicking now after a rough start to the season. He threw for three touchdowns and no interceptions while completing 66 percent of his passes against Washington State and completing 65 percent against Arizona. 
The receiving corps appears to have come to life after also having a rather sluggish start to the year, with wide outs redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and junior Michael Pittman Jr. posting impressive performances against Washington State with 64 and 72 yards, respectively, and one touchdown each. Freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown has continued to play at the high level he started the year with, leading the team with 25 receptions, 396 yards and two touchdowns, despite his relatively limited snaps. Sophomore tight end Josh Falo showed an impact for the Trojans for the first time this season, tying with St. Brown for the highest yardage against Arizona with 54 yards.
The running game appears to have found its stride as well, as the trio of senior Aca’Cedric Ware, sophomore Stephen Carr and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai have dominated on the ground over the past two weeks, scoring five touchdowns on nine yards per carry.
The quality of the defenses that the Trojan offense has faced recently has helped with their offensive production, but against a Colorado defense giving up an average of 18.4 points per game, things won’t be as easy for USC. The Buffaloes have only given up more than 21 points once on the year (28 by Nebraska), and have their fair share of playmakers on that side of the ball. Sophomore linebacker Nate Landman has racked up 45 tackles and two interceptions on the year, while sophomore defensive end Mustafa Johnson leads the team in sacks with 4.5. 
Colorado Offense vs. USC Defense
The Colorado offense comes into this week ranked No. 18 in total offense. Junior quarterback Steven Montez is an NFL caliber prospect who is tied with Tua Tagovailoa of Alabama for the highest completion percentage in FBS at 75.2 percent, to go with 1,420 passing yards and 11 touchdowns against only two interceptions. 
“[You can] just see [Montez’s] comfortability now and his poise in the pocket,” Helton said. “He’s not throwing a lot of interceptions. He’s 11-2 right now, 75 percent completion. He looks like he’s got three years of experience under his belt. He’s guiding the football team, not making any mistakes. He’s one of the reasons they’re 5-0.”
The Buffaloes have firepower on the ground as well, with senior running back Travon McMillan gaining 528 yards and four touchdowns. Montez himself has added 125 yards and three scores. 
“[Colorado’s] effectiveness in their run game is underrated, which is making them stay extremely balanced,” Helton said. “You look at their percentages on first and second down, it’s heavy run. They want to be a run team first, they take their shot and then get the ball out on the perimeter.”
However, it’s sophomore receiver Laviska Shenault Jr. who will demand the bulk of the USC defense’s attention on Saturday. Shenault leads the country in receiving yards and receptions per game, with a stat line of 51 catches for 708 yards and 10 touchdowns from scrimmage in only five games. At 6-foot-2 and 220 pounds, Shenault has been unstoppable, whether he’s carrying the ball out of the backfield, making tacklers miss in the open field or burning entire secondaries down the sideline. 
Washington State’s potent passing offense was a challenge for the Trojans, and the duo of Montez and Shenault will threaten to be even more dangerous. The Trojan defense has struggled to generate much pass rush, with four sacks in the previous four contests. Senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin has been the only player able to reach the quarterback, recording two-thirds of the team’s sacks. A big game from him and improved play from teammates like redshirt junior defensive lineman Christian Rector seem essential if the Trojans want to slow down Colorado’s passing game. 
Although the veteran duo of seniors cornerback Iman “Biggie” Marshall and safety Marvell Tell III have performed steadily for the secondary, it’ll be up to players like senior cornerback Isaiah Langley, freshman cornerback Olaijah Griffin and freshman safety Talanoa Hufanga to step up in order to keep Montez in check. Expect the Trojans to fare better in defending the run, where they’ve been good for most of the year, led by senior linebacker Cameron Smith and his 47 tackles.
“One of the beauties of having our schedule is you always have to be in playoff championship mentality,” Helton said. “It makes you ready for these games. It doesn’t matter if it’s Stanford, Texas [or] Washington State on the road. It’s always like it’s the Super Bowl. Our kids are used to that now. Now we’re coming in playing for first place.”
Prediction: Colorado 35, USC 28
The Trojans and Buffaloes match up well, and the game could realistically go either way. After all, it is a home game for the Trojans, who haven’t lost at the Coliseum in 18 games. The game hinges on USC’s defense; if they’re able to contain Montez and Shenault, the Trojans could very well add another game to their home win streak. However, the Colorado offense is incredibly potent. It seems like a lot to ask of the Trojan offense to expect them to keep up. Expect a high scoring game, but for Colorado to potentially pull away late.

If the Trojans had the chance to not play their upcoming matchup against Colorado, it would be a really smart move.   Unfortunately, this is college football and not a game of poker, where you can just leave the table and come back later. I say this because unless USC routs Colorado on Saturday by at least a couple touchdowns, fans and analysts will question USC’s ability. 
Let’s look at the two most probable outcomes of Saturday’s game: Either USC wins by a small margin or Colorado wins. Yes, Colorado is the leader of Pac-12 South and it does best USC in nearly every offensive and defensive statistic. But, once again, statistics are only relevant in context. 
Looking at the Buffaloes’ schedule, they have only just begun to meet relevant competition. In their first three games, the Buffaloes faced Colorado State, Nebraska and New Hampshire; I wouldn’t consider any of those squads elite football programs. On the other hand, they have played against two Pac-12 foes in Arizona State and UCLA, which happen to be the two worst teams in the Pac-12 South. It’s clear that Colorado has been able to “show” its eliteness through inflated stats, including their 2,453 yards of total offense. In stark contrast, USC has seen Stanford and Texas, two very solid teams. 
I don’t think Colorado deserves to be the No. 19 seed or even in the Top 25, and I don’t think USC deserves it either. If USC wants to prove it is an elite team, it needs to start putting up some serious points soon. That’s tough because the team is “incomplete” on so many fronts (hence the name of this Sports Extra). Like managing editor Eric He and columnist Trevor Denton have both said, this team has too much talent to not dominate games against weaker teams like Colorado. 
Take USC’s game against Arizona, for example. The first half showcased the team USC can be, and the second half glaringly illustrated how this team needs discipline and it still incomplete. In the first half, USC put up 17 unanswered points. The offense looked extremely dynamic, completing passes all over the field — including a couple tight end receptions (what a concept for USC), and the defense was absolutely lockdown. I remember thinking to myself at halftime, “USC is back, here is where they start rolling.” I had no reason not to think that, as the team has steadily brought things together throughout each game. Freshman quarterback JT Daniels’ strokes of genius became more and more prevalent, and the running game took off at the hands of senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware. 
But then came the second half.
My inner thoughts changed to, “Oh boy, here it goes.” I wouldn’t be surprised if that game was part of some conspiracy theory in which USC decided to put a completely different team on the field just to see what would happen. Arizona scored 20 unanswered points, and if it weren’t for a couple key defensive stops and the 60-minute time constraint, USC would have lost that game.  
USC must win this game against Colorado, and it must win by a large margin. It is imperative that the Trojans play as the team that fans saw in the first half of the Arizona game. Moreover, the penalties must stop. It’s difficult to win a game when a piece of yellow cloth keeps moving the ball 10 yards in the wrong direction. To provide some context, USC was penalized 169 yards against the Wildcats, and that game was on the back of its 118-yard penalization affair against Washington State. Both the penalty situation and second half performance come down to one word: discipline.
The Trojans have more than enough talent to be a solid football program. They have the capability to rout teams in at least a couple of their remaining matchups. I can only imagine what players and coaches were talking about this week behind closed doors. At the very least, the Colorado game will be a very telling gauge for USC. A win will grant them control over the Pac-12 South, but I am going to need to see some discipline out of this team before I believe that they have the ability to play up to their full potential.

In this Halloween fantasy, 13-year-old Marnie discovers that she is a witch. She finds a concealed portal that leads her to Halloweentown, a place where warlocks, ghouls and witches live isolated from humanity. The surprises and adventures Marnie faces in Halloweentown spurred a thrilling series.

Rev. Greg Vance spoke about the portrayal of Catholicism in different films across genres on Wednesday night at the Caruso Catholic Center. (Kaitlin Morris | Daily Trojan)
For decades, Hollywood has used Catholic themes, imagery and stories in its movies. Rev. Greg Vance discussed this phenomenon with students in an event called “Catholicism in Film: Deep Truths and Stereotypes.” at the Caruso Catholic Center Wednesday.
Vance began by listing the reasons people watch films, whether it’s the presence of a certain actor, director, composer or otherwise. He told the audience that watching certain movies can enrich their spiritual life because they take inspiration from a movie’s premise or message. To illustrate this topic, he divided movies into two categories: whether Catholicism is central to a movie’s plot and whether the movie contains theological themes.
“I’ve been thinking about these categories … for a long time,” Vance said. “I developed [them] through my experience of watching movies and trying to interpret [them].”
Vance organized his presentation on Catholicism in film into four categories: films about the church that are theologically aware; films about the church that are not theologically aware; films not about the church that are theologically aware; and films not about the church that are not theologically aware.
Throughout the presentation, he explained how various movies fit into each classification, showing trailers or clips for each.
“I was looking for movies that not many people would’ve seen … because I wanted people to come away with a thought of, ‘Well, I want to watch that movie,’” Vance said. “I also wanted movies that [represented] each category that I was trying to develop.”
In the first section, he showed films like “Risen” and “Of Gods and Men” that are set in Biblical times or centered around priests. However, he noted that some movies in this category, like “Agora,” did not necessarily support the theological message.
The second category mostly consisted of horror movies that center around a demonic entity. Vance explained how films like “The Nun” or “The Exorcist” use Catholic imagery to evoke fright, but are not based in theological knowledge. To illustrate how detached many of these horror movies are, he showed “The Devil and Father Amorth,” which detailed an actual exorcism. In the film’s trailer, director William Friedkin claims he did not know much about an exorcism when directing “The Exorcist,” thus rendering that film not theologically aware.
In the third category, Vance showed the sheer volume of popular films considered theological based off their imagery or parallels to Catholic teachings. He used the binary sunset scene from the original “Star Wars” because its imagery and music represented the beginning of spirituality. He discussed how Sam carrying Frodo in “Lord of the Rings: Return of the King” was author J.R.R. Tolkien’s version of the Calvary, in which Simon held Jesus while he carried the burden of the cross.
He also discussed how many sports or war movies, such as “Any Given Sunday” or “The Great Dictator,” alluded to Catholicism through their portrayals of teams as churches and speeches as sermons.
“He talked about how movies can be enriching spiritually but also don’t have a surface appearance of theology,” said Joseph Bioche, an undeclared freshman who attended the lecture. “I thought about it in a different light.”
Vance said finding movies that were neither about the church nor theologically aware was challenging; he only showed “Wall Street,” explaining how its glorification of greed classified it as an anti-sermon.
He concluded with an overview of the importance of narrative and Catholicism, stating that the relationship between the two elements falls in between binary opposition and complementarity. 
“I thought it was very well put together,” Bioche said. “Father [Vance] had a lot of good and insightful things to say, but at the same time, it wasn’t too dense.”
After the presentation, Vance opened the discussion to the audience for questions, who supplemented the discussion with their own suggestions of movies that exist in a theological gray area. The event’s final message was spreading an understanding of the nuances of theology and the way Christian images are represented in popular media.
“Underlying [this event] is the recognition that story and image and picture is a powerful way to move the human spirit,” said James Heft, President of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies. “Therefore, if we don’t pay attention to it, both aesthetically and rationally, we will miss out on some of the most powerful media there is in our own time.”

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
Just yesterday, millions of people celebrated National Coming Out Day on social media. In an exercise of performative wokeness, Facebook came to play by allowing users to list coming out as a life event on their timelines. But should there be a single day designated for people to come out? Probably not. 
Coming out is a lifelong process that every person in the LGBTQ+ community goes through. We come out to our friends, colleagues, loved ones, family — even to strangers we meet at parties — all in varying periods in our lives. While I find it quite arbitrary and archaic, coming out is an inescapable component of the queer experience, one that has tremendously helped me in my search for identity.
While a valiant effort to celebrate the important holiday, Facebook’s decision to include this new feature also devalues the experiences that queer individuals endure their entire lives. For me at least, allowing users to include “coming out” on their respective timelines comes at a hefty cost. Encouraging users to post explicit personal information that data miners and advertisers can take advantage of diminishes the celebratory spirit that characterizes the day. 
Whether that is an example of corporate social responsibility or a misuse of personal data is up for debate. However, one thing is certain: Coming out stories should neither be commodified nor disguised as a gift to a historically marginalized society. 
When activists Robert Eichsberg and Jean O’Leary founded National Coming Out Day in 1988, their intention was to allow LGBTQ+ people to live their truths without fear. Thirty years later, National Coming Out Day has become much more than just a day of solidarity for the queer community. It serves as a reminder of the progress we’ve made and the need for us to continue fighting for inclusion. Most importantly, it is a commemoration of the pivotal moments that allowed us to break away from social perceptions of who we should be and finally accept who we truly are. 
In the digital age, there is no question that coming out posts from friends, celebrities and other public figures have become integral to the fabric of queer culture. It is inspiring — and so incredibly brave — to see people of all ages taking to media to share their stories to a broader audience. In retrospect, I am grateful to every Facebook friend who shared their coming out story. In discovering their own voices, they helped me find mine. 
Exactly two years ago, I found myself in a difficult position, grappling with whether or not I should come out to my family. My best friend Dennis made a simple post on Facebook to celebrate National Coming Out Day. After reading his blurb of less than 200 words, I came to the realization that sooner or later, I would have to be honest with my parents, who were still coping with my brother’s coming out. In his post, Dennis reinforced a notion that, while overstated, is something I and so many queer individuals forget: There are people who will always accept and love you, no matter your sexual identity. 
After several failed attempts to come out to my parents (the only people I had left to tell), I finally decided to express my frustration by writing about it in my Daily Trojan column. While it was initially intended to be somewhat of a personal catharsis, “The A Game” became a public medium for me to share my personal struggles with balancing various facets of my identity. Somewhere during that process, however, I unintentionally came out to my parents when they stumbled upon what I had been penning and sharing with approximately 10,000 potential readers. 
The column my parents discovered resulted in a two-month fallout between us, and left me in a deep state of depression. However, even in the midst of our quarrel, I continued to write about my experiences in real time — an emotional release that I do not regret. 
In writing and sharing “The A Game,” I found support and love from friends, family and acquaintances, even from teachers who I had not spoken to in years. Over a year later, my relationship with my parents has never been better. Most of all, the incident helped me discover my own voice — my proudest accomplishment to date, which somehow began with reading people’s Facebook posts (special thanks to Dennis).
After scrolling through Instagram and Facebook posts over the course of National Coming Out Day, I found myself inspired all over again by the impact of those who shared their coming out stories. And in light of the event, I hope everyone, queer or straight, remembers the power of their own voices — and knows that they have the potential to help others find themselves.

The panel featured professionals from CPJ, ICIJ and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. The group discussed media integrity and protecting the rights of the press. (Ben Cormier | Daily Trojan)
A discussion Thursday at the Annenberg Auditorium, “Safeguarding the Truth,” invited prominent journalism professionals to discuss media’s purpose and the need to defend the rights of investigative and local reporters.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Committee to Protect Journalists co-sponsored the event. Panelists Bastian Obermayer and Marina Guevara came from ICIJ, a nonprofit newsroom, while CPJ, a nonprofit organization that promotes press freedom, was represented on the panel by executive director Joel Simon. 
Columbia Graduate School of Journalism Dean of Student Affairs Sheila Coronel started the discussion by highlighting the importance of the press in revealing truth. 
“Press should provide fact-based, evidence-based news that allow the public to make informed decisions — from whether we should do more about climate change to who to vote for,” Coronel said.
The panelists’ conversation covered a wide range of topics in journalism, including the potential for collaborative global efforts to establish a network of trust among reporters. 
Ramzi Malouki, the Los Angeles correspondent of the Foreign Affairs Bureau at CNEWS, shared his personal experience collaborating with local and international reporters in Tunisia.
Coronel summarized the major characteristics that innovative, transnational journalism organizations embody: collaborative rather than competitive, global and efficient with technology. 
She emphasized the lack of global infrastructure to support press freedom, especially for local reporters who are most vulnerable to government pressures and other threats. 
“We have to find institutional ways to address that vulnerability,” Coronel said. 
Guevara, the ICIJ deputy director, acknowledged the current progress on press freedom and stressed the need for improvement. 
Simon also clarified his definition of press freedom. 
“Press freedom is not to defend what you agree with, but to defend what you don’t believe in, the journalism that offends you,” he said. 
After the discussion, the panelists opened up the floor for audience questions.
Briana Trujillo, a senior majoring in journalism and international relations, asked about ways journalism students can learn to be accountable producers of news. The panelists advised her to learn everything she could and encouraged her to explore and invent new ways of storytelling that appeal to her generation. 
The hour-long event ended with a closing reception during which panelists and participants talked one-on-one.

USC has not always had the best relationship with public transportation. In his book, “Railtown: The Fight for the Los Angeles Metro Rail and the Future of the City,” Ethan Elkind discusses a one-day conference held at the University in 1976 where local scholars rallied against a proposal for rail transit, questioning its profitability and whether Los Angeles’ transportation system really needed it. Eventually, Elkin wrote that the rail proposal would be struck down by county vote — though the University didn’t singlehandedly make this decision, it certainly contributed to it. 
The 1976 episode demonstrates the power USC — and institutions of higher education in general — wield in local politics, particularly with transportation infrastructure. Although the University now benefits from having three Metro stations within close proximity, it should use its regional influence to continue to support city rail and bus extensions.
To understand how the University would benefit from advocating for public transit, look no further than the recently constructed Expo Line, which connects USC to downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica and everything in between. Completed in 2015, the Expo Line was a boon for students, who regularly use it to commute to their internships in the city; and after the Santa Monica stop was added in 2016, they used it to go to to the beach. 
While the Expo Line is the most obvious example of Metro’s recent success, the system is continuing an ambitious expansion plan. Several projects currently in the works would provide USC students comprehensive transit service at an affordable price. For example, Metro’s Crenshaw/LAX Line, which is set to open late next year, will connect with the Expo Line at a nearby station and take patrons directly to the airport, a major benefit for students traveling by plane. Furthermore, the Downtown Regional Connector, which is projected for completion in 2021, will connect the Expo Line directly to the Gold and Blue lines, enabling easier travel to Pasadena and points beyond. Lastly, the ongoing proposal for the Bus Rapid Transit on Vermont Avenue, if approved, will be a convenient option for students making the trek to Koreatown and Hollywood.
The University can undertake a number of key measures to support Metro. One way would be by incentivizing students to use public transportation. Colleges nationwide have begun adopting “U-Pass” programs, which use school revenue or student fees to offer discounted or free transit. Successful U-Pass programs such as that at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are not only encouraging young people to take public transit but also providing city agencies with a sustained revenue stream that can then be used for further improvements. Currently USC is experimenting with a U-Pass for graduate students, although it is unclear whether those benefits will be extended to undergraduates in the near future. USC faculty and relevant officials can also provide public support for new projects, which would potentially shift public opinion of public transportation as a viable and worthy investment. In a large city like L.A., where opposition can — and does — come from every corner, even a small effort toward supporting these projects can make a big difference.
As an agent for progressive change, USC should seek to improve transportation for not only its students, but residents of the city around it. Metro’s expansion — the Crenshaw/LAX Line, Downtown Regional Connector and Vermont Avenue Bus Rapid Transit — will benefit both USC students and those living in the affected neighborhoods, increasing their mobility and access to the rest of the city. In this traffic-dense region, efforts must be made to reduce automobile dependence and its adverse impact on the environment. 
USC professor of clinical preventative medicine Edward Avol put it succinctly in a 2015 letter Provost Michael Quick. Avol said that USC should support mass transit “not because it is cost effective, not because it is politically expedient, but because it is the socially and environmentally responsible thing to do.” 
If the University provides support for these projects, it will be doing its part to ensure a better future for students, the South L.A. neighborhood and Los Angeles at large.

Alan Hanft, a former child psychiatrist at the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, took a medical leave of absence last year due to an autoimmune disease. He was asked not to return to the office. (Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan)
A former child psychiatrist has filed a lawsuit against the Keck School of Medicine of USC, the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles and a hospital director for wrongful constructive termination, disability discrimination and other complaints last month.
Dr. Alan Hanft requested a medical leave of absence in October 2017 at CHLA due to an autoimmune disease. Hanft was hired through the Keck school to work at the hospital. However, Hanft took time off from work in December to March 2018 to take care of his own health. He returned to work in April, only to find an administrator and two security guards waiting for him in his office, according to the suit. The suit also stated that Hanft was escorted out of the office in front of his colleagues, and was told that he couldn’t return.
“I was humiliated,” Hanft said. “Never in my life was I escorted anywhere by security guards.”
After this incident, Hanft and his legal team drafted a civil complaint — suing Keck and CHLA for discrimination based on disability, harassment, retaliation, defamation, intrusion into private affairs and wrongful constructive termination in violation of public policy, among other charges.
Hanft said that his removal from the office was not an isolated incident.
USC Keck declined to comment, citing employee privacy. “Due to employee privacy issues, USC is unable to share details regarding personnel matters,” a university spokesperson said in an email.  
According to the complaint, Susan Turkel, an associate professor of psychiatry and the behavioral sciences and director of psychiatric child services at CHLA, had violated his right to privacy by pressing him to reveal personal information about his diagnosis before he requested a leave of absence in October. Turkel is listed in the Keck School of Medicine’s faculty index, and is being represented by USC.
Turkel did not respond to Daily Trojan in time for publication.
“Dr. Turkel persistently and repeatedly pried into my medical history and resented me when I wouldn’t share it with her,” Hanft said. “She was pressuring me for it. I told her that I was concerned that she would tell everyone else on the team, and she told me I have to accept that.”
CHLA declined to comment on Hanft’s allegations. 
As a doctor, this intrusion into private matters seemed off-putting to Hanft, who referenced the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other obligations of privilege and privacy that doctors swear to uphold.
“[Turkel] acted like she owned [my medical history] and it was hers to do what she wanted with,” Hanft said.
In November 2017, Turkel complained to Steven Siegel, the chair of the department of psychiatry about Hanft’s problematic and condescending behaviors and attitude, according to a memo obtained by the Daily Trojan.
Turkel’s memo described Hanft as being difficult to work with, establishing poor rapport with patients and being unresponsive to colleagues. Turkel called Hanft’s “fitness for his current position” into question and requested that his contract not be renewed. 
Hanft said that the memo was a malicious pretext set up to fire him. 
The Daily Trojan obtained five years of professional evaluations dating back to 2012, in which CHLA division chiefs called Hanft “outstanding,” “someone who met challenges with good-grace” and someone worthy of promotions. 
For each year from 2012-16, the question on the evaluations: “Are there behavioral issues?” was answered with a “no.” Three of these evaluations were signed by Turkel. 
John Winer, an attorney from Hanft’s legal team, said these documents showed a lack of support for Turkel’s claims. 
“There is zero indication of the pretext on which they [asked him to leave],” Winer said. “We were able to review a lot of the documents from the investigation file and … what we learned is that there is zero support for Dr. Turkel’s position in the case.”
Hanft further detailed the pain he endured during his final months working at CHLA under Turkel, characterizing it as a hostile work environment. 
The civil complaint said Hanft was yelled at for attempting to discuss his leave of absence. 
“[Turkel] was still glaring at [Hanft] and told him that she did not want to discuss the subject [of his leave] anymore and told [Hanft] to stop talking about it,” according to the civil complaint. “[When] Turkel left, [Hanft] closed the door to his office and began crying.” 
A month before he was removed from his office in April, Hanft began seeking legal advice and brought his case to the law firm Winer, McKenna, Burritt and Tills, LLP.
“The bad things that were happening seemed to be escalating,” Hanft said. “Bad things [were becoming] so bad they became intolerable. That’s when the legal [route] became more active. [Turkel] knew about my health issues, and when I requested time off it became much more of a problem.”
Winer stated that constructive termination — which Wex Legal Dictionary defines as “when an employee quits a job because working conditions are so intolerable” — was one of the main claims of the suit.  
“He couldn’t handle it anymore,” Winer said. “Instead of being welcomed back [to work], he was escorted out like a criminal in front of all of his coworkers.”
Hanft said that he believed the security guards were not necessary and that a phone call would have sufficed.
“They knew that [day] was my return date,” Hanft said. “I don’t understand why they didn’t call me the day before. Instead, I showed up.”
Before his official resignation at the end of May this year, Hanft said that he had repeatedly asked higher ranking members of the administration within Keck and the University to seek help. 
USC’s Office of Equity and Diversity reached out to Hanft via email in January, and Hanft arranged for a meeting in February, per emails obtained by the Daily Trojan.  The office is still conducting its investigation, and no conclusions have been reached, according to Hanft’s legal team. 
OED deferred comment to the University.
“I had reached out to [administration] high up within Keck and the University and it seemed like my concerns fell on deaf ears,” Hanft said.

One day last October, Ariella Amit suffered a panic attack in her dorm.
“It was [from] a buildup of issues that I had with my mental health in the past,” said Amit, now a sophomore majoring in public policy. “Just dealing with school and adjustment.”
Once she was able, Amit requested an in-person consultation with a mental health counselor at Engemann Student Health Center. But getting one took over a week because Amit did not meet the requirements for a student in “crisis” — she was not experiencing either a loss in her family or a breakup, among other possibilities. 
When she finally got to meet a counselor in person, she was told she was in need of “long-term counseling,” which Engemann does not provide for students on an individual basis. Instead, the counselor sent Amit a list of four clinics and centers in downtown Los Angeles.
“I felt that they pushed me off to the side because they prioritized short-term counseling,” Amit said. “I would have appreciated even short-term counseling, but they just told me that since my issues were more long-term, they couldn’t offer me anything except group therapy, which I didn’t want.”
Amit’s experience is not uncommon. At Engemann, approximately 70 percent of students who come in for mental health services are referred out, creating challenges for those who can’t afford to commute or don’t have time to travel off campus.  
Engemann is now working to reduce these numbers, announcing earlier this fall that the mental health department will add 12 new full-time therapists over the next two years. According to Robert Mendola, USC’s executive director for student mental health, the center’s goal is to establish trust between students and mental health service providers on campus.
“That is something that we face across the country, not just here,” Mendola said. “How do we have students receive the care and the feeling that they are truly being helped right from the outset?”
A model for short-term care
Engemann’s mental health services prioritize students in crisis or at risk of harming themselves, Mendola said. To that end, short-term care aims to help students grappling with problems like failing an exam or getting over a breakup. Counselors evaluate students and refer those like Amit — who might require more specialized therapy or prefer to talk to someone of a specific gender — to clinics, centers or social workers based on their needs. The places students are referred to can be as far as Santa Monica or Beverly Hills. 
From the list she was given, Amit called CENTERED Individual and Family Counseling on Vermont Avenue, since it accepted her health insurance and was within walking distance. Almost a year later, she has yet to receive a response.
“I just feel that it’s a lot harder for students to get a referral and then muster up the strength to call them and deal with that on your own,” Amit said. “[Engemann] should hold your hand and walk you through the referral process if they don’t offer the services.”
The referral process, Mendola said, can feel “very demoralizing.” While the initial consultation serves as a brief assessment to determine the student’s needs, it does not necessarily lead to treatment. 
Though the University focuses its resources on short-term care, Mendola said, the department is so underfunded that one therapist oversees 1,800 students. The International Association of Counseling Services recommends having one therapist per 1,000 students for the highest quality of care.  
“With that ratio, you will hear from most people that all they do [at Engemann] is refer you out,” Mendola said. “[It’s] really hard to change one’s reputation when the fact is that that’s what you’re doing.”
In a memo to the USC community on Aug. 20, Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman stated that Engemann aims to reduce the percentage of referred students down to 20 to 30 percent by adding 10 full-time therapists throughout this academic year and two more the following year. So far five new therapists have already begun working at Engemann.
“I felt that they pushed me off to the side because they prioritized short-term counseling.” — Ariella Amit, sophomore majoring in public policy
But for Amit, these changes don’t address the need for long-term care — which would treat more serious issues like depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Amit said at the very least officials should provide more support and follow-up with students throughout the referral process.
“USC should make more of a sustained effort to bring in even more counselors to make sure that everyone is supported at least by the [counselors] we have for short-term [care], and then [can be] guided for the referral process,” Amit said.
Short-term care can work for some students, as Angela Villamizar found — but not everyone has access. A few weeks into her sophomore year, Villamizar sought help from Engemann’s mental health services, starting with a brief phone assessment in 2016. 
“There were just a lot of transitions that were happening from all the excitement from freshman year,” said Villamizar, now a senior majoring in international relations and non-governmental organizations and social change. “There was a period in September for two weeks where I really didn’t want to do anything. I was always in bed, and when I woke up, I didn’t look forward to the day.”
Knowing that the lack of counselors would place her on a waitlist, Villamizar decided to enroll in a program in Engemann that allowed her to meet with a graduate student pursuing a career in mental health counseling. She spent eight sessions with the graduate student, an unlicensed therapist, an experience she called “very lucky.”
Most students are restricted to six sessions at Engemann before they are referred off campus,  if they still require more support. But mental health cannot be solved by a “magical pill” that wipes away students’ problems, Villamizar said. It requires time and consistent meetings.
“The first session is really you just processing through things and then seeing where you’re at,” Villamizar said. “The rest of the sessions really help you open up more, and your counselor gets to know you. If you only have four sessions, that really hinders their ability to pinpoint certain things and for you to feel the benefits of going. You need the time and the process.”

Rebuilding a reputation
When Mendola started working at Engemann last September, his first move was removing the waitlist. 
“If you’re in a season [where] there is more acuity, students are coming in with greater distress,” Mendola said. “What that does is push back your routine — people who could benefit from short-term counseling even farther into the wait because with the limited amount of staff, you are always going to see the ones who are in acute need first.”
Mendola said he spent the past year reevaluating the mental health department — for example, hiring more therapists from the Keck School of Medicine of USC’s psychiatry department. Mendola hopes this will help reduce the number of referrals by bringing therapists closer to where students live on campus. He also plans to hire two behavioral health consultants who can help establish policies and procedures.
“To send a student without a car [and] with a tight schedule to take an hour each way just to see someone for 50 minutes is not realistic,” Mendola said. “The fact that we could make a difference at USC around those struggles will be something that we should be proud of, and we are in the process of that.”
Engemann has also adopted JED Campus, an assessment and strategic planning initiative, to gather more insight on students’ mental health. Through JED Campus, Engemann has launched surveys like Healthy Minds to gather student responses for a four-year internal review. 
The center is also looking to launch a peer counseling program based on the initiative’s recommendation. 
“[It] makes sure that we are plugging all the gaps, meeting all the best practices for how to provide health for the campus, which includes a public health model [and] not just an individualized care for the students,” Mendola said. 
Let’s Talk, a program Engemann piloted this semester, allows students who do not feel comfortable with the school’s mental health services to receive support. Students can walk into sites scattered throughout cultural centers and the School of Cinematic Arts, as well as on the Health Sciences Campus, and have conversations with Engemann officials without feeling the pressure of having a counseling record at the health center.
“It is truly a drop-in,” Mendola said. “It’s a way of helping students feel comfortable with us … of reaching out. It’s not a form of clinical treatment.”
On Sept. 10, USC Student Health held two open discussions in light of National Suicide Prevention Week, but they were cut short when no students showed up.
“It’s not [the students’] fault,” Mendola said. “It points more to our need to have a more effective relationship with the students, to be part of the framework.” 
Villamizar, a resident assistant at Fluor Tower, said that Engemann has been offering resources like therapy groups through residential education, as well as support meetings for residential assistants. However, she thinks that the center still has a long way to go in establishing trust with students.
 “They’ve been trying to address the issues that are there, but I don’t think they know how to,” Villamizar said. “They’re still trying to be proactive, but they’re actually reactive … But it’s important that they’re engaging with the community and in those conversations.”
