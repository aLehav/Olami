Qingyun Ma will be stepping down as the dean of the USC School of Architecture following the end of his term in 2017, according to a memorandum sent out yesterday by Provost Michael Quick.
Ma was known throughout the USC community for the development of the USC American Academy in China, which has promoted a cross-cultural exchange in the arts, humanities and architecture, and the joint bachelor of science in geodesign between the Spatial Science Research Institute and the Price School of Public Policy.
He created his own architecture firm, Ma Designers and Architects: Strategy, Planning, Architecture and Media, in New York in 1996 and in Shanghai in 1999. Ma was recognized for his designing and building of urban spaces and buildings by being named one of Businessweek’s most influential designers in the world.
Ma was born in 1965 in Xi’an China and, according to USC Cinematic Arts’ World Building Institute, Ma graduated from Tsinghua University in Beijing in 1988 with a degree in civil engineering in architecture. He received his Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania in 1991.
Ma then practiced architecture at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. After practicing there, Ma created his own firm, MADA s.p.a.m., which has designed buildings like the Longyang Residential complex and the Silk Tower in China. He collaborated with Rem Koolhaas on the book The Great Leap Forward and also worked on the Central China TV headquarters in Beijing and the Stock Exchange Building in Shenzhen.
Ma has had experience as a visiting professor at Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University. He has also taught abroad in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and France.
The memorandum ended with praise and thanks for Ma’s contributions to the USC community and stated that Ma will return as a faculty member after his term as dean.
“I am delighted that Dean Ma has decided to remain a member in the School of Architecture’s faculty following his deanship,” Quick said in the memorandum. “He is a valued member of the Trojan Family.”

David Bridel is taking the main stage at the USC School of Dramatic Arts.
Bridel, performer, interim dean, director of the master in fine arts acting program and associate professor of theater practice, succeeded Madeline Puzo as dean of SDA on Friday.
Bridel has been an active faculty member at USC for the past 10 years, and he sees his new role as a way to expand the school.
“There is so much to develop, sustain and improve in the school that this kind of service position is very satisfying for me,” Bridel said.
In order to advance the development of the school, Bridel hopes to use the existing faculty to provide greater opportunities for students to enter the workforce by inviting liaisons in the industry to speak to students, for example.
“The school has excellent faculty and a very energized student body,” Bridel said. “I do feel that in the grand scheme of things we are looking to develop our contemporary programming, create more ways for our students to enter the industry with more know-how.”
Bridel said his experience as interim dean will allow him to maintain the existing reputation of the school and also improve upon it.
“I’ve had one year as the interim dean already, and I’ve worked very hard to create more opportunities for our students in the employment sector,” Bridel said. “Our students have auditioned for many more professional productions in the last year than they’ve had previously.”
His personality and experience working with students got him the job, Bridel explained, and that personality will benefit the school in the long run.
“I do have a lot of energy, and I have a genuine sense of what lies ahead,” Bridel said. “My own personality is very optimistic and forward-looking and very much a builder of trust and excitement and genuine enthusiasm.”
Bridel has extensive experience as a director, choreographer, teacher, playwright and librettist.
His published plays I Gelosi and Sublimity, winner of the 2013 Best Satire Award in the United Solo Festival, have received international acclaim.
As dean, Bridel hopes that he can use his experience working in other countries to improve on the international presence of the school both in the undergraduate and graduate levels, noting that the SDA has a large percentage of international students in its graduate program.
“We actually have an unusually high percentage of international students, and that’s been noted by peer institutions from other parts of the country,” Bridel said. “In my own life experiences as a professional theater artist, I have done an enormous amount of work in a vast range of different countries, and it’s very much in my field of interest to expand our reputation abroad.”
His work has appeared around the world and on big-name shows like Dancing with the Stars. Bridel is also an contributor for the American Theatre magazine and The Soul of the American Actor. He is the founding and artistic director of The Clown School in Los Angeles and associate director of the theater company Four Clowns.
Bridel is excited for what the future may hold and hopes that the school will be part of the University’s push for implementation of alternative media outlets like virtual reality.
“This is a time of unprecedented opportunity in my field,” Bridel said. “There are so many other changes happening and it’s happening really fast, and while that can be a little bit dizzying, it also provides a lot of opportunity and a lot of potential.”

USC will offer scholarships for up to five Syrian graduate students and one undergraduate student who are unable to continue their education in their home country due to the unrest in the region, the University announced Monday.
The announcement follows a university pledge on March 28 to uphold a resolution passed by the Graduate Student Government in October 2015. The resolution called for USC to join the more than 50 higher education institutions as a member of the Institute of International Education Syria Consortium for Higher Education in Crisis, which connects displaced Syrian students with university funding sources.
“The University of Southern California is proud to deepen our work with the Institute of International Education by joining the IIE Syria Consortium, furthering our contribution to one of the most pressing humanitarian issues around the world,” Vice President for Strategic and Global Initiatives Anthony Bailey said in the press release.
Students who receive the scholarships, offered to those who meet USC admission standards, will arrive on campus in Spring 2017. Full-tuition scholarships for master’s degrees will be offered by the Price School for Public Policy, Viterbi School of Engineering and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. In addition, one full-tuition scholarship will go to an undergraduate student in any major, and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will provide additional funding for Ph.D. candidates.
The civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, has displaced more than half of the country’s population. The Obama administration agreed to accept 10,000 refugees in 2015, many of whom will be resettled in the Los Angeles area through organizations such as the International Rescue Committee. Many of those who come to the United States will be looking to resume their education, a process that the University has an obligation to support, said Vice Provost of Academic and Faculty Affairs Elizabeth Graddy.
“A university with the stature and profile of USC must ensure that students and scholars of all backgrounds are afforded the opportunity to be part of a culture of academic excellence,” Graddy said in the press release. “Our participation in the IIE Syria Consortium speaks to our commitment to the public good and to our status as a global university by assisting those whose educations have been hindered by turmoil and warfare.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the civil war in Syria began in 2012. It began in 2011. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Since 1906, every graduating class has presented a parting gift to the University. This year, after more than 1,200 votes were cast through an online ballot and Grad Fest voting table, USC’s Class of 2016 voted on a scholarship fund as their senior gift.
James Gagnon, the associate director of Annual Giving Programs, serves as a liaison  to student volunteers to spread the word about the Senior Gift program to their peers.
“The USC Senior Gift is a time-honored tradition that unifies each graduating class and recognizes its unique contributions to USC,” Gagnon said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It’s one of USC’s oldest traditions, predating even Tommy Trojan. The Senior Class Gift provides an opportunity for each senior to foster their legacy as a member of the Trojan Family and spread the Trojan spirit.”
Gagnon shared examples of past senior gifts.
“Students that walk by VKC and enjoy its bell-tower music can thank the Class of 2009, who supported its Carillion restoration as their class gift. Students that enjoy a swim at the Lyon Center Pool when it’s chilly out can thank the Class of 2010, who supported the installation of a solar thermal energy system as their class gift,” Gagnon said. “The Class of 2016 will be joining the classes of 2013 and 2014 in providing scholarship support for students based on merit and need.”
This year, seniors were asked to rank their top choices between four potential gift options.
The USC Class of 2016 Scholarship Fund received 36 percent of the votes. Twenty-seven percent of seniors voted for a USC Facilities Management Services Recognition Day, 23 percent voted for a USC Career Services Dream Dollars Program and 14 percent voted for USC Volunteer Center Friends and Neighbors Day Program.
Megan Lee, a senior majoring in neuroscience and the assistant director of University Affairs in the Undergraduate Student Government, was delighted by the results.
“The generous scholarships that USC gave me were instrumental in my decision to attend the University,” Lee said. “They made it possible for my parents, who are also Trojans, to put both me and my sister through USC and keep the Cardinal and Gold blood running through our family.”
Starting on Monday, the Class of 2016 Senior Gift campaign went into full effect, and undergraduate seniors have the opportunity to participate via email, phone and in-person donation booths. Marketing efforts including a phone outreach and a crowdfunding project that will also encourage people to donate.
“I’m definitely planning on donating,” said Jay Hasegawa, a senior majoring in economics. “I think it’s important that future students are supported in their studies and college experience and I’d like to do my part in paying it forward.”
Last year, the Class of 2015 matched a university record by raising a total of $25,000 with 96 percent participation. This year, the Senior Gift Advisory Board is hoping to get 97 percent of the Class of 2016 to vote and exceed the $25,000 goal.
The campaign will last through June 30.

Michael Escoto, senior digital strategist of the National Republican Congressional Committee and a USC alumnus, advised students on how to get into politics on Monday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The event “Running a Political Campaign” was hosted by the USC Political Student Assembly, an umbrella organization that facilitates discussion between different political groups on campus —  among them the USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and USC International Relations Undergraduate Association.
Upon starting the event, Escoto said that aside from being involved in political campaigns, he was also passionate about helping people break into politics.
“The way I got into politics was very atypical, and I wish somebody would have talked to me about it when I was in college,” Escoto said. “There is so much to learn here and events like these are great.”
Escoto then walked students through various milestones of his life in hopes of providing guidance. He discussed his first jobs after graduating from USC, which included working as a congressional district chair for the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee and then an Absentee Ballot and Early Vote Director for the Nevada Republican Party.
Escoto then discussed some of the challenges that came along with working for the Nevada Republican Party. Although there were many absentee ballot directors in many states, Escoto was the only one in the West Coast. Ultimately, this required him to conduct conference calls in the early hours of the morning to be able to speak with politicians on the East Coast.
Following his job in the Nevada Republican Party, Escoto worked for the Monaco Group, a printing and direct marketing firm. When he started working there, he and his colleagues realized that there was a wide gap between the digital presence of the Democratic and Republican Party, with the Democrats using digital media much more effectively than the Republicans. For this reason, he emphasized that a knowledge of politics wasn’t the only skill needed to work in the field and encouraged students from other disciplines to get involved in political campaigns.
“Most political science majors don’t get into politics,” Escoto said. “If you want to work on a campaign, perhaps political science is not the best major. Knowing about communication can be extremely helpful.”
Escoto discussed his experience working for Meg Whitman during her campaign for governor of California in 2010, as well as digital strategic consulting firm Targeted Victory between 2011 and 2015, before going into his current job at the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Escoto encouraged students to be flexible for jobs in the political arena. For example, learning computer programs such as Microsoft Excel, even if it’s not immediately relevant to politics, is a must — as is being ready to learn even more on the job, he said.
“When I hire people, I know most people don’t have experience,” Escoto said. “However, if they are teachable, that’s all we need.”
Students demonstrated an interest in the event in order to learn more about campaigns and breaking into the industry. Clinton Keaveny, a freshman global health major and staff writer for the Daily Trojan, said that he attended the event in order to prepare for a future career in politics.
“I would love to run for office one day eventually, and these events are a great opportunity to build connections,” Keaveny said.
Tristan Jordan, an executive board member of PSA, said that he hoped this event would encourage USC students to become more involved in politics.
“If we continue bringing more people like Michael Escoto, perhaps people would become politically engaged,” Jordan said.

The No. 5 women’s lacrosse team continues to dominate on the road, extending its winning streak to 15 straight games with a 5-4 victory against Notre Dame on Monday and remaining perfect on the season.
With the help of a go-ahead goal midway through the second half and rock solid defense the remainder of the game, the Women of Troy continue their best season to date.
Making program history with the longest single-season undefeated record, the Trojans pride themselves on depth and efficiency. With a roster consisting of roughly half seniors, USC has a plethora of experience under its belt and in times of adversity, the girls can count on their teammates to step up to the plate. On both sides of the field, the Trojans have demonstrated their skills with five different Trojans earning MPSF Player of the Week’ honors this season: junior Michaela Michael three times on offense, junior Kylie Drexel on offense, senior Courtney Tarleton twice on defense and sophomores Gussie Johns and Lydia Sutton on defense.
A crucial win came Friday against No. 6 Notre Dame, a team that the Trojans have previously struggled against. While the Trojans were outshot 30-18, their efficiency on offense shone through and landed them a 14-11 victory.
The Trojans buckled down, limiting the Fighting Irish to just 4 goals and maintaining their lead throughout a tense second half.
“We capitalized on the right opportunities today and stayed mentally tough and confident,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “We put the opportunities away at the right times.”
USC gained possession right off the bat with a draw control by junior defender Nina Kelty, yet the Fighting Irish quickly sent a ball into the back of the net to give them a 1-0 advantage.
And with a crucial save by Johns and a shot on goal by senior midfielder Amanda Johansen, the Trojans were back on track and the score was tied 1-1.
The game continued in this manner and with 2 goals by junior Cynthia Del Core and Drexel and 2 goals by Notre Dame, at halftime the score was tied 3-3. However, the Trojans could have faced a deficit given Notre Dame’s stout offensive efforts. but Johns made nine crucial saves in the first half limiting the Fighting Irish to just 3 goals.
The Trojans came out fiery in the second half with Michael sending the ball into the back of the net off a transition to give the Women of Troy a 4-3 lead. Yet Notre Dame countered with a goal off a free position to tie up the score 4-4. Rebounding with a goal of her own off a free position with 14:58 remaining, Michael regained a Trojan lead, bringing the score to 5-4.
The next 15 minutes were long with just a slim lead, but with a tremendous defensive effort on both accounts, the remainder of the game was scoreless and the Trojans came out on top with a narrow-margin victory.
“It is a good test for us going towards the end of the season and postseason where you have to have a quick turn around from one game to the next,” Munday said. “The girls showed their mental toughness and strength throughout.”
Now at 15-0, the Trojans will continue their historical journey as they close out the regular season by facing each game with a fresh perspective.
“The biggest thing is sticking to the game plan no matter the score,” Munday said. “We take it one game at a time — we want to stay true to our gameplan going in and stay confident no matter what.”
The Women of Troy  next take the field Friday, April 22 to face conference opponent Stanford at 4:30 p.m.

Two days after USC’s annual spring game scrimmage, head coach Clay Helton announced on Monday afternoon that the battle for the quarterback position will continue into fall camp.
“There were a number of open positions on our team this spring where players performed very well, including the quarterbacks,” Helton said. “I met with them today and told them that, based on how well they played, I have decided to continue the quarterback competition into fall camp.  I will wait until then to name a starter.”
As it stands, the two players who have the biggest change of earning the starting role are redshirt junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold. Redshirt sophomore Jalen Greene and freshman Matt Fink will both be in the mix as well.
On Saturday, however, Browne and Darnold were the featured passers with Browne completing 7-of-11 for 114 yards and three touchdowns, and Darnold throwing for 6-of-7 for 63 yards and two touchdowns.
After last Thursday’s practice, Helton said he misspoke about potentially naming a starter after the spring game on Saturday.
Although Browne and Darnold offer skill and talent at the QB position, it has been Browne who has earned a reputation for his maturity, composure and accuracy this spring. Darnold, a dual-threat, possesses rare speed and quickness with his feet to combine with a big arm and field awareness.
Darnold said he isn’t focusing too much about the competition, emphasizing personal improvement this spring.
“I definitely took the mentality of being the guy out here as you’ve got to do when you’re going to compete for the starting job,” Darnold said last week. “I’m still taking tips from Browne and letting him help me as well.”
With the spring game in the books, Browne remains the leader of the quarterback competition. However, with a time to develop in the summer and fall camps, Darnold could easily become the front-runner if he can complete passes with accuracy.

The perpetual stereotype of the dumb jock is far from dead in today’s society, and at college campuses, idolized student-athletes are walking to the same classes that every other student is — or are they?
At USC, student-athletes account for roughly 1.2 percent of the total student population. The USC Athletics website lists 516 student-athletes accounting for the 43,000 total students at the University.
With the added burden of competing at a Division I school on teams that are regularly competing for national championships, it would be easy for student-athletes to allow academics to fall by the wayside.
Not the case at USC
The NCAA collects and reports data from colleges and universities regarding both their student graduation rates and student-athlete graduation rates. The rate is determined by calculating the proportion of first-year, full-time student-athletes who enter a school with institutional aid and graduate in six years. This is called the student-athlete graduation success rate.
USC’s overall student-athlete GSR is 81. In comparison with the regular student body though, the numbers are a bit more grim. Ninety-one percent of the 2008-2009 freshmen class went on to graduate in four years. Only 70 percent of student-athletes from the same class graduated at the same time.
This is partly due to the time commitments that athletes are dedicating themselves to on a daily basis that the regular student does not have. According to a study by the Pac-12 in April 2015, student-athletes self-reported spending 50 hours a week on athletics during the season. This is significantly more time than the 20 hours a week permitted by the NCAA.
At the College Sport Research Institution at the University of South Carolina, Mark Nagel is the associate director of the program that recently researched graduation gaps of Division I basketball players.
“The bottom line is, particularly in revenue sports, it’s putting a round peg in a square hole,” Nagel said. “Universities are set up with education as their goal. Football and basketball programs are not set up with education as their goal. As the money has become unbelievably larger, it has dominated what is important.”
The GSR rate for USC’s men’s basketball teams is 82, tied for the fifth highest in the conference. The football team, however, which has the lowest GSR on campus at 58, is second to last in the Pac-12.
Magdi El-Shahawy is USC’s associate athletic director in charge of Student-Athlete Academic Services. He declined to comment for this story. However, he did speak on the matter in an article on the USC Ripsit blog from November.
“Our current football GSR is a victim of our on-field success back then,” El-Shahawy said. “Of the 71 players in the 2005 to 2008 cohort, 41 of them graduated in the six-year GSR window. Of those who didn’t, 22 competed in the NFL. Ten left USC within one semester of graduating and four came back to USC after the six-year window to get their degrees. Next year, when the 2005 figure will no longer be part of the calculation, our football GSR will rise significantly.”
The Trojans’ second lowest sport in terms of GSR is track and field (73) something Nagel said isn’t that surprising despite the fact that it isn’t a revenue sport.
“Track and field is one of the few non-revenue sports that attracts a disproportionate number of African American and minority athletes,” Nagel said. “African American and minority athletes are coming from schools that are not as strong. It looks a lot like a revenue sport having underprepared students coming into the system.”
Of the African American track and field athletes who were freshmen in 2008-2009, only 63 percent graduated in four years and 75 percent in the GSR period of six years.
Seven sports have a GSR of more than 90 percent including two that boast a 100 percent rate — women’s basketball and women’s golf. The other sports are women’s water polo (96), women’s soccer (95), women’s rowing (94), women’s volleyball (91) and baseball (91). Baseball is the only men’s sport above the 90 percent mark.
What are students studying?
On the USC Athletics website, an athlete’s major is often one of the listed facts in the personal section.
Of the 516 student-athletes on the website, 89 did not have a major listed. An additional 99 student-athletes have their major listed as undecided or undeclared, leaving 328 listed majors.
Thirty-seven percent of student-athletes with a listed major fall into two majors: communication (67 students) and business administration (53 students). Both majors require 48 units of coursework. The drop-off between business and the next most common major is significant — there are 22 student-athletes that are human biology majors.
Above the rest
The USC Ripsit blog, the athletic department’s blog, lists the average GPA of a student-athlete at 2.94 during the fall 2015 semester. According to the Panhellenic Council website, the average GPA for the USC student body is 3.21.
“What is particularly impressive is that they are able to do well academically at a university where the academic profile of the student body continues to rise,” El-Shahawy said in the post. “That means our student-athletes are performing better and doing so against better competition.”
USC’s blog post went on to note that the highest team GPA was the women’s soccer team with a cumulative GPA of 3.30. However, the women’s lacrosse team saw the most athletes make the Dean’s List with 15 members.
“The fact that in most cases the female athletes are much closer to the performance of the female student body,” Nagel said. “If you are a female athlete, there isn’t as much of a pot of gold waiting for you. There is greater motivation for women athletes to keep education as a priority.”
The pot of gold waits for NFL hopefuls, however. The football team recorded its highest in-season GPA ever of 2.66, according to the blog. Thirty-six members of the team recorded a 3.0 GPA and the blog post said the team had its “fewest-ever sub-2.0 performers.” A 2.0 is the lowest GPA a student can have and graduate.
“If you ask any coach, they need to win, they need their athletes to perform,” Nagel said. “No one ever gets fired for bad graduation rates, they get fired for not winning. Losing equates to a lot less money.”

Manchester United has floundered this season.
While the English soccer giant has shown flashes of brilliance, the team has lacked the identity and intimidation factor it possessed in past years.
Man United is currently sitting at fifth in the Premier League, 17 points back from leader Leicester City. While Leicester and Tottenham have grabbed headlines for mightily overachieving, United has faded into the background as a team simply trying to qualify for the Champions League next season.
In many ways, the Red Devils’ mediocrity at the moment should surprise no one, as they are still rebuilding after a mass exodus of franchise-defining players. For countless seasons, Rio Ferdinand anchored the back line and Paul Scholes ran the show in central midfield. Ryan Giggs showcased remarkable stamina along with Scholes and was also complemented by a youthful talent by the name of Cristiano Ronaldo.
Mediocrity is typically not the operative word for a team anywhere in the vicinity of the top of the table in such a competitive league, but this is one of the most prominent clubs in the world. At the moment, United lacks the flare and command it had not so long ago.
But United’s return to the summit could be expedited by a dangerously effective tool at its disposal: youth.
Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Timothy Fosu-Mensah have a combined age of 56. Martial and Rashford are leading the next wave of great United attackers, while Fosu-Mensah has displayed stout defense as well as impressive tactical versatility since making his senior squad debut in late February.
After moving to United from AS Monaco, Martial seemed like a project — a supremely talented kid who would need some time to develop as he learned from the likes of Wayne Rooney. Instead, Martial has emerged as a reliable option for Louis van Gaal. He has bagged 13 goals in all competitions this season and has even drawn comparisons to his compatriot Thierry Henry, a legend for both Arsenal and the French national team.
Martial was not the only United infant to dazzle with a deft touch, searing pace and composure in front of goal.
Rashford came out of the woodwork — otherwise known as the United Youth Academy — and scored two goals in his first game. In the next game, he scored two against Arsenal at Old Trafford. He had sent the faithful into a frenzy not only because he had helped his team to victory over the Gunners but also because United fans knew this coaching staff had unearthed an absolute gem.
While Martial and Rashford have made a real impact and have scored some meaningful goals thus far — like Rashford’s rip against West Ham last week in the FA Cup — Fosu-Mensah has the ability to play virtually anywhere on the pitch.
Against Tottenham in a Premier League clash earlier this month, Fosu-Mensah was forced to exit the match early due to injury. For 68 minutes, he had contained Spurs playmaker Christian Eriksen by balancing discipline with strong tackling. However, two minutes after he exited the match, his flank went under siege. The area he had previously occupied looked eerily vulnerable.
Just after Fosu-Mensah departed, Tottenham scored 3 goals in six minutes.
Martial, Rashford and Fosu-Mensah have the ability to influence games. So while United as a whole continues to look like a shell of its former self, the young pieces are giving fans serious reason to be optimistic. United could win the FA Cup this season. It could also cap off the campaign with the good news of Champions League qualification for the 2016-17 campaign.
But the future is too bright to ignore. The beast is young, fearless and rapidly maturing. A handful of kids have made Manchester United a must-watch team once again.

In the midst of a five-game losing streak, the baseball team will look to get back on track against Long Beach State Tuesday.
Head coach Dan Hubbs gave his players the day off from practice Monday in order to “focus” and “mentally prepare” for Long Beach State after a being swept in a three game series on the road against Oregon last weekend.
“It was a bad week overall, coming off of a good week,” Hubbs said. “We did not pitch well. We put too many guys on base, threw too many balls over the middle of the plate. And because of that, we lost.”
Though Hubbs notes that there were some positive takeaways in the Oregon series from the offense — led by senior Timmy Robinson, who went 3-of-4 on Friday and 3-of-5 on Saturday, Hubbs affirmed that the greatest weakness with the team is its starting pitching.
Redshirt junior pitcher Joe Navilhon kept the Trojans largely in the game Friday, pitching seven innings and allowing 4 runs off of six hits. Tied 3-3 until the sixth inning, it was a series of two throwing errors from the defense that allowed Oregon’s Jack Bennet to score the go-ahead run of the contest.
But sophomore pitcher Mitch Hart — who is being slowly and cautiously reinserted into the rotation after returning from injury — lasted just an inning in his start Saturday, giving up 4 earned runs on two hits and four walks.
Senior Kyle Davis, the Sunday starter, threw five innings, allowing eight hits and 5 runs. Davis too got roughed up in the first inning, allowing 2 runs off of three hits, and failed to stop the bleeding in the second inning, giving up 3 runs off four hits.
“We are playing good teams, and when you play good teams with good pitchers, the games are going to generally be close,” Hubbs said, “We have to do a better job of not giving up base runners and being able to execute all of our pitches. And I think, once again, it comes with the intent to get the guy out as opposed to hoping that we make the right pitch.”
Hubbs noted if this team is going to turn their season around, players have to place their attention towards winning their immediate game or matchup as opposed to a championship and that the pitchers cannot dwell upon anything beyond winning their immediate battles with the batters in front of them.
The Trojans have also had several three-game win streaks this season and Hubbs knows his team is capable of another one.
“We have seen how one good weekend can just turn your whole season around,” Hubbs said. “But we need to just have one good game before having one good weekend.”
USC defeated Long Beach State 7-4 in their only previous meeting of the year 7-4 on March 1 thanks to a career-high five-hit day from senior outfielder David Oppenheim.
Long Beach State has a 21-13 overall record, and Hubbs is preparing his players for a talented pitching staff that generally throws fastballs and sliders for strikes down in the zone. They do not give up a lot of free base runners and boast an athletic offense that likes to run and make sure the runner scores when on base.
“At the end of the day, you have to win as many games as we can but we can only win them one game at a time,” Hubbs said. “We have got to focus on Tuesday and then we will worry about Washington State after we worry about Long Beach.”
First pitch of the one game series is at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Dedeaux Field.

Coming this Thursday, students will battle against each other in order to claim the title of best dance crew on campus. Now is your chance to get a glimpse of the dance talent right here on campus.
On Thursday, the USC Performing Arts Committee will be hosting USC’s Best Dance Crew: ARTiculate Movement, a student-organized dance competition featuring dance teams composed entirely of USC students. ARTiculate is the theme for this year’s annual art week hosted on campus. ARTiculate aims to incorporate every aspect of art that is created through all different types of mediums, including visual and performing art.
Leo Xia, a director of the Dance off Alumni Project, said he and his team, “contribute [to the ARTiculate movement] by trying to have as much fun on stage as possible, while hopefully giving off the same vibe to the audience.”
The event will be taking place in Bovard Auditorium from 7-10 p.m. In past years this event has taken place in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom, but it has drawn so much attention over the past couple of years that the Performing Arts Committee has had to change the venue in order to accommodate the massive crowd that is expected. USC’s Best Dance Crew is a part of USC’s Performing Arts Committee’s: Arts Week that runs from April 18-22. This event will be following other student-run like Arts Week Kick-Off Event, The Artist Network Mixer and ESA Solar Powered Band.
The dance crews that are set to be featured include: The Axiom Project, Lipstick Mafia, USC Zeher, Dance Off Alumni Project, USC Street Dance Society and Break Through. These groups specialize in hip-hop and break dancing, with the exception of USC Zeher, which will be incorporating a Bollywood-style performance.
“I am definitely excited; this is a cumulation of all the hard work we have put into this set all semester,” Xia said.
The dance crew who wins will be awarded a $250 gift card provided by the Performing Arts Committee.
Following promptly after the event will be a spectacular finale performance by a hip-hop performing guest Quest Crew. Quest Crew is famous for competing in Season 8 of America’s Best Dance Crew and is known for their unique choreography and skillful breakdancing. By following the USC Performing Arts Committee’s social media accounts, guests can enter to win VIP access to this event. Winners will participate by competing in contests through these outlets throughout the the duration of Arts Week.

Captain America: Civil War hits theaters on May 6, and Marvel promises a superhero movie audiences have never seen before. With the two principal characters squaring off, the Avengers are forced to choose sides as they battle the moral questions of government oversight and superhero regulation. Featuring more superheroes that he previous Avengers movie, Captain America: Civil War welcomes back the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Vision (Paul Bettany), as well as introduces new characters Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the much-anticipated third incarnation of Spider-Man (Tom Holland).
Advance screenings have revealed surprisingly good reviews for the action film, receiving a 94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. The Daily Trojan had the opportunity to interview one of the stars from the blockbuster, Emily VanCamp, who plays Agent Sharon Carter.
“When we find her, she’s working in Berlin, the Joint Terror Taskforce,” VanCamp said. “We meet her at Peggy’s funeral and that’s where Steve finds out sort of who she really is, because it was never mentioned in The Winter Soldier. And that’s sort of the beginning of when the whole Accords thing is happening, so she sort of finds herself a little bit between a rock and a hard place in terms of her loyalty to Cap.”
In the first film, VanCamp’s character was introduced as Steve Rogers’, (and therefore Captain America’s), neighbor and it wasn’t revealed to the audience until later in the movie that she actually works for S.H.I.E.L.D. VanCamp said that the reveal to Steve Rogers in this movie is a compelling advancement in the pair’s relationship moving forward, especially considering her allegiance to the organization for which Captain America opposes in this film.
In terms of making the creative jump to film, VanCamp has had a successful career in television, most recently starring as the lead character in the TV show Revenge. Before that, she starred on Brothers & Sisters, as well as Everwood. On her transition from television to film, VanCamp believes her experience in television has helped her when on a film set.
“I remember we did a little fight sequence on Captain America that, you know we were just losing the day,” VanCamp said. “We were running out of time and we had to shoot it in an hour and a half, or something ridiculous. And because I had that TV background, it makes it a lot easier to sort of learn quickly and get it done.”
The movie was directed and written by Anthony and Joe Russo, the duo that previously worked on the second installment in the Captain America franchise as well as the television show Community on NBC, the brothers will continue their work within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as they take on directing the two-part Avengers: Infinity War movies that are set to begin back-to-back filming for nine months at the end of 2016 to be theatrically released in May 2018 and May 2019, respectively. Throughout the press tour for this movie and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, cast members have had only positive reactions to working with the brothers, and VanCamp is no exception.
“I mean, they obviously are brothers so they have a tremendous rapport,” VanCamp said. “But with a movie of this scale, it kind of is amazing to have two people that, one person can be focusing on one thing, one person can be focusing on the other. So they really get great performances.”
As one of the sole female actors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, VanCamp has been recognized by Marvel for her work and has been tasked with spearheading a new diversity campaign, aimed at encouraging young girls to get involved in STEM  programs.
“To know that in doing this, it could be you potentially empowering young girls, is amazing,” VanCamp said. “I think Marvel’s really trying to diversify. They’re really sort of incorporating more women in these great parts and I think it’s just kind of heading in the right direction, you know? But it’s super enjoyable to play, too.”
As Captain America: Civil War rapidly approaches worldwide release, fans and celebrities alike have begun choosing sides in the Civil War, siding with either Team Captain America or Team Iron Man. VanCamp is conflicted, as are most fans.
“I mean, I always … I guess, because I have such an attachment to Sharon and her loyalty to Steve and Captain, I just feel that I sort of agree with him,” VanCamp said.
Although VanCamp is unsure of where her role of Agent 13 will take her in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is with excitement and anticipation that we await her next action-packed appearance.

If season one was more about Kimmy, played by Ellie Kemper, rediscovering the world, season two of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is more about Kimmy and the rest of the characters adapting to unfamiliar situations. This is especially true for Kimmy, who eventually winds up in the care of a therapist with a drinking problem, played by Tina Fey, who helps Kimmy cope with some of the problems that she’s struggling to deal with after going through a dark period in her life. Kemper does a wonderful job by keeping Kimmy’s innocence while adding a tinge of darkness to it. Her naiveté and stuck-in-the-’90s personality is still great material for big laughs, but she’s not as naïve as she was last season. This works well in the new season, as it draws attention to the consequences of Kimmy’s insistence to help others while putting her own happiness on hold. It’s a difficult but utterly hilarious process that keeps the show fresh and charming and adds layers to Kimmy’s instantly lovable character.
While there is more of a focus on how Kimmy helps herself, there’s still more than enough room for the other characters’ antics as well. Jane Krakowski returns as Jacqueline White — a surprisingly very well-rounded character this time around. After last season, where she made the transition from a stereotypical rich socialite to a middle-aged divorced woman who is more in-touch with her Native American roots, Jacqueline struggles to find who she is. Krakowski does an incredible job to the point where she almost upstages Kemper. Nearly every scene she’s in is filled to the brim with gut-busting laughs due to her comedic timing and heartfelt moments as she slowly finds the strength to become a self-assured, independent woman. While Krakowski’s performance is still very reminiscent of her character Jenna Maroney on 30 Rock, Krakowski does it so effortlessly to the point where it seems like she’s not even acting at all.
One of the more lovable but loathsome characters, Titus Andromedon, played by Tituss Burgess, loses a bit of his unredeeming aspects as a character as he charts new territory in a steady relationship with his new boyfriend Mikey. Burgess still maintains that pizzazz that immediately draws attention to his character, but he expands his range more by showing Titus’s vulnerability. It’s very sweet, and he reveals a side of Titus never seen before. He’s still the down-on-his-luck and flamboyant character that is one of the show’s main sources of laughter like he was last season, but his character, like others in the show, deals with more serious topics.
Even a character like Lillian Kaushtupper (played by Carol Kane) who was mainly used for comedic effect in season one, becomes more of a focal point with her fight against gentrification. Her tendency to drift into the realm of absurdity with her humor find a more suitable place this season. She’s no longer seen as just the crazy lady who is reliable for a good laugh, but as someone who can provide just as much laughter while tackling the pressures of seeing the neighborhood she’s grown up in slowly be lost to a younger, richer crowd.
This season never gets too serious;  quite the opposite, in fact, since a lot of the more serious topics in the season would be alienating without the quick-witted humor that moves at a rapid pace. Despite being a comedy, this show can’t be watched passively or without undivided attention, since most of the plays on words, visual humor and “high-brow” jokes that are distinctive of Fey’s comedy are everywhere this season. Everything from female empowerment to confronting feelings of repressed homosexuality is dealt with in the newest season, and it gives the show a feeling of purpose. Last season was able to coast by on its charm and humor, and while these two aspects are definitely not in short supply this season, the characters tackling more important issues in their lives give the audience a reason to really care about them. Without being too heavy-handed, the characters resolve fundamental problems in their lives that make them better people in the end. They’re no longer one-dimensional, and this type of development for a comedy series is impressive.
This season stayed true to what worked in the previous and didn’t hesitate to move into unknown territory with deeper plotlines for the characters. The nonstop laughs will have audiences clutching their sides by the end of the episodes, but it will also earn their respect and admiration for making smart and conscious commentary on controversial issues and subjects through the use of its humor. When the lingering laughter has stopped, audiences will remember the positive outlooks on timeless issues that this season provided in addition to some of the funniest material that’s been made in a while.

Last week, the first weekend of the 2016 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was held in in Indio, Calif. The USC campus and its surrounding areas seemed vacant over these past few days, most likely due to the significant chunk of the student population inhabiting the Coachella Valley for the festival. As a result, I reflected on the influence that music has had on my life. Furthermore, I contemplated how my own musical tastes, which seem to differ from most people my age, factor into our society as a whole.
To begin, I am an avid fan of classical music. Although my overall music taste spans across a broad range, I listen mostly to classical music, particularly opera. Many of my colleagues find this peculiar; in fact, I am often asked how my interest in this archaic genre came to dominate my psyche. I am unsure of when exactly it began, though I know it was sometime during early childhood: My mother, a classical pianist, used to play symphonic recordings, such as Antonio Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons, as I would drift to sleep. In addition, she enrolled me in piano lessons and my elementary school’s choir, while also encouraging me to participate in any sort of performance activities that captivated me. Granted, I am aware that many children were placed in similar situations, yet for most, no adoration for classical music was fostered. Therefore, I ask this question: Why isn’t classical music appreciated as much as pop music?
There are many misconceptions about classical music. For starters, I have encountered a fair amount of students who believe that orchestral and operatic performances are infrequent and inaccessible, which is definitely false — in addition to the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Los Angeles Opera, both of which offer student tickets at a discounted price, there are on-campus performances organized by the Thornton School of Music multiple times a week, all of which are free with a USC ID. Indeed, the declining number in attendance isn’t a result of poor advertising, but rather a lack of interest imbued within younger generations. Somewhere between baby boomers and millennials, classical music fell into obscurity. It is a chilling thought that even at some of the most celebrated and respected opera houses today, bankruptcy looms as each day progresses. And in a society that prefers Bieber to Boulez, it is exceedingly difficult to remain optimistic regarding the future of this craft.
Nonetheless, I am not a complete square with regard to more popular genres; I do listen to a fair amount of non-classical music. I’ve even been to a few music festivals, the last one being FYF Fest in 2015. There, I was excited to not only see some of my favorite artists, such as Belle & Sebastian and Solange, but also to broaden my pop-music horizons. Admittedly, I didn’t encounter any bands that struck my fancy, other than the groups that I had already known and cherished. However, I gave it a fair shot, and the experience allowed me to explore different artists that I most likely would never have come across had I not spent more than$200 for a ticket, only to stand in the sweltering heat for 10 hours waiting for a performance that I may or may not like. I don’t consider myself straight-laced, but I would much rather be surrounded by a 100-piece orchestra than a thousand screaming fans.
With all that being said, I understand that classical music is an acquired taste — I can’t expect others to fawn over Debussy’s opulent chromaticism if I am just as obtuse in recognizing my friends’ adoration for Drake. Though it was my mother who introduced me to this genre so many years ago, it was my own interest that propelled my ardor for this genre. However, the future of this art form is dependent upon Generations Y and Z. Maintaining a colloquial appreciation for classical music will help keep it alive, and could prevent the encroaching closures of many classical music companies across the country. When all the cards are laid out, it is your interest that can save our future.

Arya – I came across your article “Classical Music Should Be Appreciated More” and felt the need, as a fellow USC alumni and classical music lover, to comment. 
My love of classical music did not start in childhood, but grew from my interest in popular music. I was a rock & roller from its beginning. I still remember being excited upon first hearing Elvis’ “Hound Dog” when it premiered on L.A. radio in ’57. I was seven. Not long after, I started guitar lessons.  Fast forward a decade to the summer of 1967, when I went to Monterey Pop to see Hendrix, the Who and countless other rock greats. And I had the good luck at that time to be in the pop charts myself: I was the singer of a #1 gold record, “Incense and Peppermints” by a one-hit-wonder band the Strawberry Alarm Clock. What a great summer that was!
But by the early 70s, as my visions of becoming rock legend faded I realized I had better go to college. Plus, my passion for music pressed me to “listen wider” – rock was getting dull I felt.  So I started at Pasadena City College and had the great fortune to take a two-semester course in music history taught by an inspiring teacher (Mr. Heckman, for the record). And the world of Josquin, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Wagner and so many others unfolded in one exciting class after the other.  I transferred to to USC as a music major (history and composition), and then grad school in musicology as the University of Chicago. I then took another life-turn, and got into advertising which is what did for my career. I just sold my agency and, at 67, am heading to retirement.
But my passion for music generally and classical music in particular has not waned at all. I still play in a rock band — but listen to classical music almost exclusively. (I’m anxiously awaiting the opening of the Ring Cycle next month here in DC).  And as I’ve gotten more time, I’ve started teaching — so far, a history of classical music and a course in Beethoven. 
And I share very much your concern over the flagging interest in classical music. What a world of riches there are to be discovered so easily – but are simply overlooked! But as my own experience tells me, you don’t have to choose. (I loved being surround by 1,000 screaming fans when I saw the Beatles at Dodger Stadium…almost as much as seeing the Mahler Symphony of 1,000 a few months ago.) But you do have to adjust. Classical music seduces you, but to “get it” you have to listen with focused concentration, and follow the “conversation.” Pop music attacks you. (There’s a reason most successful pop records have what’s called a “hook.”) Its the difference between fine wine and Coke. Each has its place.
Your concerns about the demise of classical music I am afraid are commensurate with an increased in ability to sustain focused attention on anything – from politics to poetry to person relationships. (How many young couples do I see in restaurants staring at their cell phones instead of each other?!?!) Yes, I sound like the old analogue fart that I am – but classical music simply does not work as a multi-task. It requires linear, singular, uninterrupted attention. Without that, yes, it is boring. So I’m not too hopeful. But articles like yours do cheer me up a bit. My days at USC very enjoyable and nice to see there are bright young people out there still trying to push the boulder the damned hill. Good work!

Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival attendees may have noticed a key demographic missing from the Indio main stage during the festival’s premiere weekend — female headliners. Of the three performers featured atop the Coachella lineup, which kicked off its first of two weekend-long performances Friday through Sunday, none were women.
Though the lack of female representation within the festival’s headliners is nothing new, it does highlight a disturbingly pervasive trend throughout both music festivals and, more broadly, throughout the music industry. Given the status Coachella has as the highest-grossing music festival in the industry, it is best-suited to establish the precedent of promoting a more female-friendly lineup.
The male-centric headliners at this year’s festival — including LCD Soundsystem, Guns N’ Roses and Calvin Harris — have prompted many to dub the festival “Brochella,” but those who are familiar with Coachella know that the festival has always had a significant dearth of female performers. In fact, the only female headliner the festival has ever had is Björk, who last took Coachella’s mainstage nine years ago.
This is not simply a Coachella problem. Other major music festival headliners, such as those featured at other festivals including Lollapalooza, Outside Lands and Bonnaroo, have also been known to fail at highlighting the women-driven talent in the music industry today. The Lollapalooza 2016 lineup boasts zero female headliners, down from the one female headliner (Florence and the Machine) featured at last year’s festival. Similarly, both Outside Lands and Bonnaroo neglected to include any female headliners in their 2015 and 2016 lineups. What the continued failure to showcase female talent in music festivals highlights, however, is the broader issues faced by female talent in what has long been a male-dominated industry.
This is not to say, of course, that festivals such as Coachella don’t have female performers. In fact, this year’s Coachella lineup boasts more female artists than the festival has in years past — just not as headliners. Festival organizers have failed to slot deserving women artists in their topmost spots because of their intent to bring in artists who fit the traditional Coachella aesthetic: edgy, indie rock artists with the capacity to draw in large crowds. But if the fact that only 47 of the 162 acts featured in Coachella’s 2016 lineup are female — up from 26 last year and 28 the year before — is any indication, this aesthetic has been largely male.
But it doesn’t have to stay that way. Coachella is changing, and so too should the demographics of its headliners. As the festival continues to broaden its genre-focus beyond its indie rock origins — embracing everything from classic rock to electronic dance music — it should look to expand the diversity of its performers, and this includes highlighting the abundance of successful women in music. Beyoncé, Rihanna and current Coachella performer Ellie Goulding are all examples of women dominating the charts in a historically male-dominated industry. Moreover, they are exactly the kind of performers that can bring in the big audiences that festival-organizers are going for.
Though this gender disparity in the music festival scene certainly won’t be fixed overnight, there is a solution that promises to expedite the process — simply put more women at the top of the lineup. With so many top female artists having top spots of the lineup for multiple years in a row (Ellie Goulding has held the same second-tier spot since 2014), there’s no reason why festivals like Coachella can’t feature a female headliner.
There’s always next year.

This past Sunday, Bethany Cosentino of the band Best Coast took to Twitter to criticize Chris Brown. When I saw the tirade covered by Pitchfork on my Facebook news feed, I naturally assumed that she would be attacking the way that Brown has managed to maintain a relatively untarnished career despite being found guilty of violently assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna. Instead, Cosentino was criticizing Brown’s lyrics in his new single “Back to Sleep” for “perpetuat[ing] rape culture.” While Cosentino’s tweets insinuate that she, too, finds Brown to be an abhorrent excuse for a human being, the focus on a few lines of words over his actual violent past reflects a greater trend in how we judge the music industry.
Take the recent criticism levied against the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which I attended this past weekend. Some cultural commentators have disapproved of Coachella’s lack of female headliners, dubing the event “Brochella.” These critics focus on the numbers of Coachella’s acts, not the nuance, thus missing the point entirely. This year, for instance, the festival was headlined by LCD Soundsystem, Guns N’ Roses and Calvin Harris. LCD Soundsystem fits the standard dance-rock theme that used to characterize Coachella, and Guns N’ Roses acted as the nostalgia magnet to attract large crowds and media attention. However, most agreed that closing out the festival with Harris was an odd choice, as DJs and EDM music are staples for the smaller tents but rarely ever perform on the main stage.
Yet the rationale for Harris became obvious after Rihanna came out and stole the show, performing “We Found Love.” Many critics then asked: Why did Rihanna not just headline instead? The answer is likely a product of her highly strategic release and promotion of ANTI. It’s not that Harris is necessarily more talented than Rihanna, and it shouldn’t be seen as a comparison of their artistic narratives.
Ultimately, the argument that Coachella’s lineup makes the festival anti-feminist fails for two main reasons. The first is the culmination of multiple specific, open declarations of feminism during the festival. Most notable was Kesha’s riveting performance of “True Colors” during Zedd’s set. Coachella’s choice to showcase the singer’s talent and give her the opportunity to hold up a colossal middle finger to the judge who argued that “every rape is not a gender-motivated hate crime” was an act of actual feminism, not just words.
Then there was the pointed decision to juxtapose Canadian singer Grimes against Guns N’ Roses. Not only did Grimes hold her own against the more than three-hour set of GNR, but she also took the opportunity to endorse Bernie Sanders for president and Janelle Monáe performed with Grimes wearing the word “feminist” on her shirt.
The statistical disparity between male and female performers can be somewhat accounted for by the large number of EDM acts required to fill up the smaller tent as EDM DJs are more often men. Perhaps that number is a product of sexist oppression, but more likely it is a consequence of individual choice.
I would rave on and on about every female performance I saw, from the Lauren Mayberry-fronted CHVRCHES to Sia — and the incredible dancing and performance art of Maddie Ziegler — but realistically, I saw too many to list in this column. The fact is that Coachella 2016 was a series of compelling setups by men for women to arrive and steal the show. And looking at gender alone misses the incredible progression of the music festival entirely.
Instead of obsessing over numbers or ignoring the highly impactful demonstrations of female empowerment at Coachella, feminist activists would be better served by combating real issues such as female genital mutilation, which affects 200 million women and girls worldwide; rape, which affects an estimated 293,066 Americans 12 years of age and older annually, or even a less violent but equally pervasive issue, such as chronically low female turnout in STEM education and professions — which is the underlying cause behind the gender wage gap — because quite frankly, I am tired of this first-world, white feminism usurping productive dialogue over actual threats against women.

With Hillary Clinton at the forefront of the presidential race, one might be tempted to ignore the startling gender disparity that exists elsewhere in U.S. politics. From birth, Americans are taught that their country represents the quintessence of “democratic” values. In this familiar tale, one learns that, here in the United States, equal opportunity and equal representation exist for everyone. However, upon closer examination, a confounding truth emerges: Women hold less than 20 percent of congressional seats, despite constituting a majority of the country’s population. A movement toward gender parity, consistent with the democratic values this country claims to uphold, will require not only breaking down gender stereotypes, but also a reformed electoral system that accommodates more than two political parties.
According to Representation2020, a program by FairVote, the United States ranks 95th in the world for the percentage of women in its national legislature — behind countries such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which American political discourse conveniently labels “backwards” while praising the U.S. and other Western countries as “progressive.” The numbers further highlight this hypocrisy. As of today, there are only 20 women serving in the Senate and 84 women in the House of Representatives. On the local and state levels, the numbers are equally disappointing. Women hold less than 25 percent of statewide and state legislative offices, while locally, less than 20 percent of cities have a female mayor. The paucity of female leaders on the national, state and local level is due, in large part, to the scant number of women running for office — the result of pervasive gender stereotypes.
Gender bias is one of the most salient barriers to a woman’s decision to run for political office. According to a Pew Research study entitled Obstacles to Female Leadership, about 47 percent of females believe women running for political office are expected to meet higher standards and must do more to prove themselves to their parties and constituents. In contrast, only 28 percent of men see these expectations as impediments to the eventual election of female candidates. Organizations like Name It. Change It. and Representation2020 are attempting to combat the sexist and misogynistic media narratives that discourage women from entering politics. These organizations encourage greater female candidacy by holding political parties accountable. Despite these efforts, at the current rate of progress, 500 years must pass before women reach full gender parity in terms of equal political representation.
This unconscionable rate mandates a more radical solution — specifically, a reformed electoral system based on proportional representation. Elections to the House of Representatives and most state legislatures are held in single-winner districts, based on a winner-take-all electoral system. This means that the party that receives the most votes wins the entire district. If one party receives 49 percent of the vote and the other, 51 percent of the vote, the former party with 49 percent loses entirely. In an electoral system based on proportional representation, political parties win seats in proportion to their share of the vote. In a 10-seat district, for example, candidates who receive 40 percent of the vote will receive four seats. Proportional representation has historically, across different countries, improved minor parties’ chances for election. In contrast, winner-take-all electoral systems typically favor the parties with the greatest resources, like the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Providing minor-party candidates a chance at election is imperative. Minor parties, like the Green Party, tend to emphasize issues largely ignored in the mainstream and prioritize female leadership. In the face of greater competition, major parties, seeking to widen their appeal, will likely nominate more women.
Supporting electoral reform indicates support for progressive policy. For voters who wish to see social issues take precedence in the state and national legislatures, encouraging female candidacy and election is critically important. In the name of equality and fairness, everyone should join the initiative to honor the political voice that every woman rightfully deserves.

I don’t carry my phone around very much anymore, much to the frustration of the friend I’m supposed to be meeting for lunch. Finding internet on the move is like trying to catch handfuls of air, and there are only so many times you can see that your messages have failed to send before deciding to give up and see what’s so special about the great outdoors and spending time with loved ones. When I used to walk with my phone in my hand, I would instinctively check for the time at every possible moment, partly because my schedule always seemed so packed, and partly because I was always waiting for a text or a notification from the conversations I was trying to have all at once. Now, I rarely check the time, and in Cape Town, nobody seems to mind.
Here in South Africa, there is “now,” which is meant to mean “possibly in two weeks, but also maybe never.” “Just now” is not immediately but potentially soon, which I use when doing laundry or chores. “Now now” means that the person is playing no games and will likely show up at your house within the hour. Much of South African events and systems operate on a “just now” basis, something that my internal clock took some time to adjust to. Back at USC, in order to stay updated with Trojan Pride meetings, Helenes events, Trojan Scholars Society events and every time they were giving away Sprinkles cupcakes within a mile of campus, I had my life planned out to the minute. I would plan bathroom breaks and lunch dates, schedule alarms to remind me to send an email during my unicycle ride from one class to another, and find myself collapsing in bed, finally home at 11 p.m. after a day full of activities. I’m utilizing moments to take a step back, assessing all that should be done, but mostly focusing on what could be done after a few hours at the beach.
Seeing as how the school is on a mountain, the good amount of us who aren’t Olympians elect to wait for the Jammie bus to make its rounds around the residences and climb us up the mountain for class. It was quickly apparent that the bus schedule was merely a suggestion, or perhaps it was the schedule of a bus system in an entirely different country that was accidentally stapled to the walls here. Sometimes the bus doesn’t come. Sometimes it drives past you for no reason. One time a the driver with a bus labeled with the name of my dorm poked his head out of the window and said he was actually going home instead.
I live in the furthest, highest corner in my building from the Jammie stop, and when I step outside and see the Jammie waiting, like a little blue M&M ready to roll away, I run like a madwoman, my backpack swinging to the same rhythm of my nerdy middle school years. I quickly realized this is how people won at the game, “Spot the American.” Every other South African behind me, I quickly observed, walked slowly to the Jammie, hand sticking straight up, as if to wave a secret bro code to the driver that I wasn’t a part of. Sometimes the driver waits. Most times he doesn’t. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter. Sometimes lectures are mandatory and take attendance. It doesn’t matter. This is not to say people don’t take their education seriously. On the contrary, my peers here work harder and longer on assignments and in studying than any other peers I’ve had. But why jump over hurdles when you can walk around them at a leisurely pace?

I’m a senior and the struggle is real. Like really real right now. Graduation is fast approaching and I don’t give a sh-t about classes because they don’t mean anything. Plus, I haven’t a clue what I want to do. In an effort to escape my responsibilities, I am overextending myself in things outside of school that are taking up precious time and energy I know I need to devote elsewhere. It’s obvious, I need to clear my plate, but I don’t know how. I feel like people are counting on me now and I don’t want to let anyone down. What do I do?
The only reasonable thing you can do is to follow through with the commitments you’ve made (don’t be that guy … no one likes that guy) but start saying “no” to anything more! Get really organized with your priorities. Set realistic deadlines for actionable goals. In this last 3 percent of your undergrad career, make a last-ditch effort to effectively time manage, senioritis be damned. You’re going to get through this! Less than a month left!
And in a month, when you still don’t know what you want to do with your life (because that’s just something people don’t figure out for years, much less 30 days), graduation will have happened, classes still won’t matter and you’ll have made it through the era of overcommitment. With less on your plate, you can do some dedicated soul searching and information gathering to chart a new path forward.

Most college students know the challenge of living in a tiny, shoebox-sized dorm room with no kitchen. You reminisce about living at home, where you could make scrambled eggs or throw together a quesadilla on the stove. USC has great on-campus dining options, but sometimes you just need a quick snack and don’t want to leave your room. Or maybe it’s so late that your favorite restaurant or dining hall is closed. Well, have no fear because there are tons of delicious, pretty healthy foods to snack on in your room when you get hungry. Below is a list of eight great snacks to store in your dorm. 
1. Oatmeal. Luckily for you, most dorm rooms have microwaves. This means you can make instant oatmeal. Just add water to an oatmeal packet and pop it into the microwave to make a healthy, delicious breakfast or snack.

2. Peanut Butter. Keep a jar of peanut butter — smooth or crunchy — in your room at all times. You can spread it on anything from bread to crackers to apples. It adds a punch of protein to any snack. Also, there’s always the option of eating it straight out of the jar.

3. Granola/Energy Bars. There are hundreds of granola bar brands that taste great and are full of nutrients. Stock up on KIND Bars or Clif Bars to for a substantial, healthy snack.

4. Popcorn. Just because you’re not going to the movies doesn’t mean you can’t eat this classic snack. Opt for a less artificial, less buttery type of microwavable popcorn and enjoy!

5. Cereal. Sometimes, you just need a bowl of cereal. Instead of getting an overly sugary box, buy a whole grain cereal like Special K or Kashi. You’ll feel full and satisfied after munching on this healthy snack.

6. Fresh or Frozen Fruit. Everybody knows that fruit is always a good snack option. Keep fresh or frozen berries in your fridge for when you need something sweet. You should also always have bananas, apples or oranges lying around.

7. Nuts. There are so many tasty, nutritious kinds of nuts to keep in your room. Stock up on almonds, walnuts, cashews or pistachios. If you have a sweet tooth, throw some dried fruit and M&Ms in to make your own nutty trail mix.

8. Greek Yogurt. Greek yogurt is a healthy, filling snack to eat at any time of day. There are tons of flavors to choose, from blueberry to vanilla. The best part is, you can add your other snacks like nuts, berries and peanut butter to your yogurt!
