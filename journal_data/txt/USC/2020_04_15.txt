This year’s NFL offseason has served as a lone spark of entertainment in the absence of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic, as it has provided plenty of action in the past couple of months. In fact, this has been one of the craziest NFL offseasons in recent years.
As a result of the trading moves that different teams have made, football fans can expect to see a very different NFL landscape next season. 
Some moves that should make things interesting come September (or whenever the season starts) include running back Todd Gurley signing with the Atlanta Falcons, running back Melvin Gordon joining the Denver Broncos and wide receiver Stefon Diggs getting traded from the Minnesota Vikings to the Buffalo Bills.
But without a doubt, the biggest move made this spring was Tom Brady signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. While the move might seem disastrous for the Patriots and a contrary beacon of hope for Bucs fans, I would argue otherwise.
In a previous column, I argued that Brady was an average system quarterback rather than the greatest quarterback of all time, as he is commonly believed to be. This upcoming season could demonstrate whether my opinion is valid, as for the first time in his career, Brady will not be playing with the Patriots, where he has had invaluable coaching and defensive support his entire career.
This is why Bucs fans should not get overly excited about landing Brady as their quarterback.
Brady has often had the opportunity of playing under elite defenses — even last season, the Patriots’ defense allowed a league-best 14.0 points per game. The Bucs, on the other hand, allowed 28.1 points per game, which ranked 29th overall. Don’t get me wrong, the Bucs’ defense isn’t completely terrible — they had one of the best run defenses this past season — but Brady’s defense will not support him like it did in New England. 
This will put more pressure on Brady — who is coming off one of the worst statistical years of his career with a career-low 53.7 QBR — to produce at a high level to compensate for the Bucs’ inability to stop teams from piling on points. There’s no denying that the soon-to-be 43-year-old Brady is aging and most definitely slowing down from a performance standpoint despite new offensive weapons such as wide receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.
On the flip side, Patriots fans should be excited that their team has the opportunity to pursue a younger quarterback with more long-term promise to once again lead New England through deep playoff runs under the tutelage of the great Bill Belichick. Although the Pats have yet to make any moves, they will have plenty of opportunities to fill the position in the upcoming draft as well as the free-agent market, as former league MVP Cam Newton and former Bucs quarterback Jameis Winston are among those up for grabs this offseason.
Perhaps the second biggest move this offseason was the Houston Texans trading DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in next week’s draft to the Cardinals in exchange for running back David Johnson, a second-round pick and a fourth-round pick.
For the Cardinals, the trade was a huge steal since they acquired one of the league’s top receivers at a minimal cost. The Cards have had no use for Johnson since the emergence of Kenyan Drake, who went off on a hot streak at the end of last season averaging 103 rushing yards per game in his last three contests. And for Arizona, two draft picks was a small price to pay for Hopkins, who will most definitely make an immediate impact. 
The trade should also have a positive influence on the development of Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, who is coming off a solid rookie season in which he proved he is a more than capable NFL starter. Last season, Murray had a good — albeit not great — receiving corps with veterans including Larry Fitzgerald and Michael Crabtree. Now, with Hopkins, Murray will get a major upgrade and have an uber-elite playmaker that should boost his production and confidence. 
For the Texans, trading away Hopkins was a huge loss but not necessarily a critical mistake. According to ESPN’s Dianna Russini, Hopkins was seeking a bigger contract and was threatening a holdout if he didn’t get it. In addition, Hopkins was reportedly having issues with Texans head coach Bill O’Brien. It appears that the Texans were almost forced into trading Hopkins and taking a major hit in the process.
Houston was able to more recently obtain former Los Angeles Rams receiver Brandin Cooks in a trade for a second-round pick in next week’s draft and a fourth-round pick in 2022, but this intended replacement for Hopkins will not be sufficient enough for Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. Firstly, there is the small, yet very noticeable discrepancy in talent between Hopkins and Cooks, but what’s more is that Watson will have to develop a close relationship with his star receiver all over again.
Watson will still be able to work with capable receivers such as Will Fuller and Kenny Stills, but it’s difficult to envision Cooks being able to entirely replace the gap Hopkins had left. Thus, Watson will experience almost the opposite of what Murray will in this upcoming season, as he will have to work with a capable — but not as elite — receiving corps. 
These major offseason moves have changed the league’s outlook. In the case of Hopkins, the Cardinals instantly got better, while the Texans instantly got worse. With Brady, many people believe that the Bucs are an instant playoff contender, but I have plenty of doubts.
Stay tuned to see the NFL landscape continue to shift with this year’s virtual draft beginning Thursday, and watch for other marquee free agents such as Newton, Winston and defensive end Jadeveon Clowney to make splashes with big contracts before the season kicks off.

A former friend of mine used to joke about people having “white” and “dark” Air Force 1 energies, in reference to the popular Nike shoes worn by sorority girls, drug dealers and NFL owners alike. Seemingly wholesome, good and nonthreatening people have white Air Force 1 energy; those who seem shifty, untrustworthy and questionably evil have dark. Easy enough of a concept to grasp, right?
Well, what happens when the lines between light and dark are blurred? Sometimes I’d laugh my ass off at Anthony Jeselnik clips and my friend would mutter a passing comment that Jeselnik had “maddd dark Air Force 1 energy, dude.” But if Jeselnik was so dark and evil, why did he bring me so much joy? Is there something wrong with me for liking it?
Truthfully, the differences between light and dark are not so obvious. If we’re going by the previous descriptions of light and dark, that friend eventually proved to be dark Air Force 1 energy masquerading as white Air Force 1 energy, judging by his questionable actions rather than the things he would say (i.e. lies, manipulation, selfish behavior — you get the picture). This metaphor is probably a bit outlandish, so I will cease the comparison. Still, this binary of light and dark fascinated me, and the lines have only gotten more blurred in terms of the entertainment we consume and enjoy.
For years, television and film programming were more explicit in their definitions of light and dark, good and evil, moral and immoral. The good cowboys wore white hats and the bad cowboys wore black hats. The “bad guys” talked about death and despair, while the good guys talked about justice and righteousness. Comedy’s most celebrated voices were often light, silly and clean in their material, while the less-respected comics resorted to coarse, vulgar and taboo subjects in their work. 
Since then, mainstream comedy has only gotten darker and darker. Louis C.K. was probably the most respected and prominent voice in comedy of this century. Yet, his material was almost exclusively dark and taboo. Critics and audiences adored him because he was so open and hilarious about the things we all think about but are too afraid to openly discuss. We trusted him to be someone who wouldn’t actually act upon them, too. His credibility was lost once audiences learned about accusations of sexual misconduct that surfaced in 2017, at the height of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements.
While today, C.K. certainly isn’t the cultural force he was a decade ago, his success certainly reflected a change in mainstream preferences for dirtier, more extreme material. Even wildly popular “family” comedians like Kevin Hart and Gabriel Iglesias have plenty of vulgar or “blue” material at their disposal. Today, it’s especially impossible to imagine a “clean” comic like Bill Cosby having the kind of massive success that he did in the ’60s or ’70s. Although, if we’re being honest, there are much better reasons for that than just his material. 
The one exception to this dark and dirty rule is the massive success of John Mulaney. Still, to be fair, “Big Mouth” is one of the funniest shows about adolescent taboos, and it’s the brainchild of Mulaney and fellow comic Nick Kroll.
The youth have especially gone dark too. Go to any USC open mic (well, maybe next year), and I guarantee you at least half of the performances will consist of jokes about anxiety and depression. In fact, it’s fascinating to think that joking about one’s mental health has become so commonplace that it could be considered a hack at this point. As well, some of the most widely circulated TikToks during the coronavirus pandemic have come from an elementary school-aged kid with a drop-dead hilarious penchant for gallows humor. 
With television, a show like “The Sopranos” was so groundbreaking because no show had ever before challenged genre conventions or audiences’ notions of good and bad. The main characters were deeply flawed (to say the very least), wildly entertaining and surprisingly likable. Never before were audiences so inclined to empathize with characters as objectively awful as the Soprano family. It didn’t matter that Tony Soprano was a mob boss. He could’ve been an attorney or a plumber — the themes and lessons would still be the same.
Yet, while “The Sopranos” had fantastic comedic writing and funny moments in each episode, the groundbreaking series was a drama through and through. Still, the series’ widespread critical and commercial success opened the door for so many genre-defying series that remain popular today.
When one looks at the  “Outstanding Drama Series” nominees from the 2010s Emmys, many of the shows — including “Orange Is The New Black,” “Better Call Saul,” “Succession” and “Killing Eve” — have much more in common with dark comedies than traditional dramas like “The West Wing” or “Dallas.” The inverse is also true for recent “Outstanding Comedy Series” nominees — including “Fleabag,” “Barry,” “Russian Doll” and “Atlanta” — which are infinitely darker and more serious than “The Office” or “Two and a Half Men” from just 10 years ago. 
What does all this mean? Audiences are demanding more nuance and risk than ever, and it’s made for way better television. Dramas have never been funnier and comedies have never been more serious. Creatives trust audiences to know the difference between right and wrong. They trust audiences to be smart enough to not look at a film or television show to learn how to behave in real life. They know audiences consume art to feel a sense of comfort or solidarity in their own flawed humanity. Real life is complicated and our entertainment should be as well.

In Ambika Nuggihalli’s freshman year “Spanish Media and Literature” class, there was one particular lesson that sparked her interest: the work of Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector. While the class read Lispector’s book, “Água Viva,” Nuggihalli, now a sophomore, became infatuated by what Lispector calls “the instant-now,” inspiring her own writing. 
“I was kind of like taken by that idea of what happens in a second can never be repeated,” Nugglihalli said. “You can never come back to it. When you try to capture that and kind of bring it back, how do you do that? Can you really do that? What do you do with it? I like to think that most of my work follows that theme.”
Nuggihalli, who is majoring in communication and minoring in comparative literature, takes her present feelings, whether that be sadness or joy, and applies it to her artwork. She paints, writes poetry, draws with charcoal and is a digital artist. 
With the two zines she’s curated and created, along with her poetry, paintings and digital illustrations, Nuggihalli describes herself as an artist who “[expresses] states of mind, fleeting experiences, and stories through a variety of mediums.”
Outside of creating zines and drawing, Nuggihalli’s poetry has been published on many different platforms. She’s written for “Palaver Arts Magazine,” a USC student-run online art and literary publication and “The Luna Collective,” a Los Angeles-based zine that showcases the artwork of young adults. Most recently, her poetry collection “Arcana” gained recognition in the 2020 USC Undergraduate Writers’ Conference where she was a semi-finalist in the creative category. The collection focuses on her identity and reflecting on her past experiences. 
In her everyday life, she takes note of those instances, such as moments of stress, and transfers them to her artwork. Her drawings depict her state of mind, and her artistic epiphanies can come at any given time. Using pastels in her drawings and paintings, Nuggihalli depicts people embracing, frowning, or in a completely abstract form. Her artwork makes use of a wide array of mediums; she uses acrylic, charcoal, watercolor, colored pencils and ink. In her self portraits, smooth lines and overlapping colors express her complex mood; the colors may be warm, but the expression in her eyes is forlorn. 
Nuggihalli’s roommate, Tahrima Bhuiyan, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, knows these moments all too well. 
“Inspiration will strike her randomly,” Bhuiyan said. “It’ll be 2 a.m., and she’s supposed to be working on some essay, and then she’s just like, ‘Wait, I’ve got a poem’ and then she starts writing poetry … She channels a lot of things in her art. [It’s] definitely a way that she understands herself and the way that she expresses herself.”
Her love for art goes back to December 2018 when she began “Lotus Zine,” a zine that focuses on highlighting the experiences and voices of South Asian, LGBTQ people. 
“I had a bunch of friends who are all LGBTQ and also South Asian, and we were just kind of thinking that we should start a zine to represent how we make things as a community and open it up to other people,” Nuggihalli said. 
Nuggihalli served as editor-in-chief and curated the zine after reviewing submitted artwork from applicants. The proceeds from the 2019 publication were donated to Orinam, an all-volunteer collective of LGBTQ people in southern India. 
“I think it’s a wonderful way of getting art out to people in a way that’s actually viable and doesn’t put up barriers,” Nuggihalli said.  
Her most recent project, “Veil Zine,” is a product of her “Drawing for Art and Design” class last semester. This collection of ink drawings and witty captions represents Nuggihalli’s first foray into ironic horror and the blending of differing stories, or as she calls it, “twisted horror stories with punchlines.” 
“While the narration seems to tell one story, when juxtaposed with the visuals, a second story emerges,” Nuggihalli describes on her website. “Each tale offers two perspectives of the same situation: one on the surface, and one that peeks behind the veil.”
The zine begins with Victorian-inspired illustrations and evolves into frenzied brushstrokes as the plot progresses. With this, Nuggihalli comments on the role of women in the horror genre and their stories, which are often dependent on men. 
“They say all the suitors hoping to write themselves into her father’s will take one look at her and scream,” reads one of Nuggihalli’s captions. 
Nuggihalli is originally from the South Bay area in Los Angeles. A place where “everybody there’s also Indian or some form of Asian,” she said, speaking of the loving community of people who share a similar ethnic background. 
All of this changed during middle school when Nuggihalli’s family moved to the North Bay, near San Francisco. Her family’s move incited her artistic journey. 
“That was a big change for me as I was trying to figure out who I was,” Nugguhalli said. “That was when I started becoming my own person and not just living in the shadows of other people, which is a weird thing to say about yourself in middle school.” 
Nuggihalli describes her middle school self as a “typical nerdy book kid who rebelled.” She would sit in corners of her classes and doodle in the edges of her notebooks while friends encouraged her to keep drawing. She admits that she didn’t start taking art seriously until her junior year of high school. 
Since then, Nuggihalli has become driven, studying art theory and focusing on her creative works in her free time. For the artist, honing in on her technical skills is a pain, but without understanding the basics, she admits that there’s not much she can create.  
“I’m in the point right now, where I’m still working on the technical things,” Nuggihalli said. “I hate charcoal so much and I hate how much time it takes, and I hate realism, but that’s what I’ve been doing for the past few months because I’m like, well, that’s kind of where I need to work on things before I can do what I want to do.” 
Speaking of Nuggihalli’s drive, longtime friend Catherine Rimmer, a sophomore at Cabrillo College, believes that Nuggihalli strives for perfection as an artist through diligent, consistent work. 
“She gives a lot of respect to the people around her, which I think you can really see in her artwork,” Rimmer said. “She has a tendency in her art to make everyone really beautiful. It used to be something that — especially with the rise of art made [for] consumption on Instagram — it used to really annoy me when people in art were consistently beautiful. But, I realized for Ambika it wasn’t her trying to make her art more consumable and commodifiable, so much as [it was] her just genuinely seeing the beauty in every person.” 
With her varying interests, as an artist but also as a tenor saxophone player in the Trojan Marching Band and member of the USC Mock Trial team, Nuggihalli’s advice for creatives on how to elevate their craft is to persevere. 
“I have a lot of things in my sketchbook that I wish I had fleshed out and gone through with,” she said. “You’re not going to be able to flesh everything out, but when you have the chance and you have the inspiration, follow through with that and you might be surprised where it takes you.”

For many, paying for college may mean pulling together several different resources — scholarships, grants, student-worker jobs and loans can make a university’s large price tag much more affordable. But what happens to the price tag when the item arrives extremely different than advertised?
Obviously, no one anticipated a semester cut short. No one predicted that, by mid-March, students across the world would be attending classes in their own homes and in pajamas. Educational institutions everywhere are innovating on the fly, and professors are trying to somewhat maintain the sense of structure found in a traditional classroom setting. 
Given the state of the semester, students should be given a partial tuition refund for Spring 2020. While professors and University administration have gone to great lengths to adapt course curriculums to an online format and learn how to navigate Zoom, the caliber of education that students are receiving is evidently not the same. 
It seems logical that students would be partially reimbursed for on-campus housing and meal plans going to waste, but the same should hold true for University tuition. USC is a top-ranked learning institution and research facility, and the high cost of tuition is partially caused by the level of experiential learning and on-campus resources students have access to. Much of what tuition money goes toward is no longer accessible, like the University’s 23 libraries, laboratories or lighting stages, since the transition to remote learning. 
Closed classrooms, abandoned dorms and shuttered dining halls are only a facet of the college experience that students are missing from home. The costly biannual invoice from USC guarantees students smaller class sizes, unique course offerings and a more personalized education than students would receive at a large public university, not to mention an exclusive membership to the Trojan Family. 
Endowments, donors and generous financial aid make it possible for students of all backgrounds to attend USC. While the playing field is somewhat leveled when students are at school — free WiFi is available all around campus, laptops are available to rent and resources like the Trojan Food Pantry and Trojan Shelter offer aid to food and housing insecure students — this is not always the case when students are required to learn from home. 
Not everyone has access to the same resources, a quiet space to learn, a stable internet connection or even all of their textbooks. Although the University has made accommodations by changing the grading policy, some students may still be burdened by the loss of resources available at the University. 
While students and educators alike are making do with what they have, Zoom office hours will never be the same as interacting face-to-face with a professor, and there’s simply no virtual substitute for conducting undergraduate research in a lab on campus. Free events such as Visions and Voices and Speaker Series are postponed or canceled, and for the few events that have been moved online, glitchy audio and technical difficulties will never equate to sitting in Bovard Auditorium and listening to a presentation live.
As the U.S. economy continues to spiral downward and the unemployment rate surges in this new alternate reality, there’s no question that businesses everywhere are struggling, and even large not-for-profit research universities like USC are not immune. In a university-wide email from Provost Charles Zukoski sent earlier this month, the school’s higher administration vaguely referenced potential coronavirus-related financial trouble for the University, noting that there were “slowdowns in philanthropy and declines in endowment value” and “revenue losses from … donor receivables.” 
While the email focused more on steps that the University would be taking to save money, such as pausing hiring and nonessential travel expenses, and didn’t directly address the topic of student refunds for tuition, the overall tone in terms of financial loss was not optimistic. Many other schools are in the same boat and have chosen not to provide tuition discounts or refunds. Stanford, which sent students home at the end of the winter quarter, will not be pro-rating the end of the quarter and will be charging full price for the spring quarter, which is being operated entirely remotely. 
While frustrating and unfair, there is some legitimacy to the decision — schools can’t make up revenue lost on university housing or meal plans midway through the semester, and as Seton Hall professor Robert Kelchen noted, public and private universities “don’t have the kind of operating margin that lets them refund a couple of million dollars in the short term.” 
The entire country — and world, for that matter — is in a similar situation. Businesses, employers, employees and students are all dormant. Everyday life has stopped, and regardless of how the money is dispersed, as the world rights itself there will be a need for massive financial recovery. 
While the email sent by Zukoski was an attempt at transparency, students should expect more from USC. As unprecedented a situation as this is, USC has a responsibility to its students first. It claims to accomplish its mission of creating well-rounded contributors to society through a combination of “teaching, research, artistic creation, professional practice and selected forms of public service.” With the suspension of daily life and the introduction of remote instruction, obviously not all of this is possible. But if this is what students are paying for, then Zoom classes shouldn’t cost exactly the same as what a semester’s worth of hands-on interaction and experience would.  
Dealing with tens of thousands of individual students and their situations as well as those of all of the faculty members and employees of the University is far from straightforward or simple. The USC administration will inevitably be making a lot of tough decisions in the weeks and months to come. But so far, the University’s communication has been consistent and logical. Students are relying on administrators to be just as even-handed and understanding when it comes to their Spring 2020 tuition.

Everyone has been to a cute new coffee shop that serves matcha, blasts Lizzo on their speakers and has an iPad cash register, in the middle of a neighborhood that in no way matches the same “Instagrammable” aura exuded from the rest of the shops on the block. For many people, these renovations to various establishments feel like a “facelift” or a way for the area to modernize. New businesses, apartment contractors and universities all contribute to this “sprucing up” of the neighborhood and it’s a total win, right?
Wrong. 
The ugly side of renovations like this display gentrification, the displacement of lower-income individuals and the overall erasure of an area’s cultural keystones. New apartment complexes in South Los Angeles, North Hollywood and Boyle Heights with skyrocketing rents force longtime, low-income residents of these neighborhoods to say goodbye to places they have called home. Trendy restaurants and cafes have displaced small diners, grocery stores and shops that have resided in a community for years. This progress is only welcomed when it brings all people up, instead of only those who qualify for a higher tax bracket. 
The same is happening in the neighborhood surrounding USC. The Health Sciences Campus Master Plan — a $35 million investment in the Boyle/Lincoln Heights neighborhood that will be rolled out over the course of 25 years — as well as the beloved USC Village and investments by independent contractors to make apartment buildings for USC students in University Park might not seem like a direct attack against low-income people (most of whom are Black and Latinx) at face value. However, such investments have resulted in eviction notices for members of this community. 
Longtime residents of South Los Angeles have been backed into a corner because of spikes in rent combined with the closure of businesses. Grinder, a diner which closed down in March after operating for 48 years could not compete with the wealthy, more corporate establishments. To combat these effects, USC has invested millions of dollars into community initiatives and scholarship programs and has established a hiring program for local residents. The University has also invested $342,000 in businesses affected by the construction of the USC Village. This, however, is not enough. 
The dense population of individuals living in the areas surrounding USC, most of whom are first- or second-generation immigrants with a low-income background according to U.S. Census data, must feel the same security and prosperity that students at this University feel when they walk on campus. Throwing money at a problem to ease the damage that the University has caused isn’t enough, as it does nothing but temporarily mediate an issue that seems to have no halt. Beyond the financial crises it causes, gentrification surrounding USC’s campus contributes to cultural erasure and whitewashing. Not everything shinier or newer is necessarily better, even though the establishment of the middle class itself rests on this ethos. 
Rapid investment in this city to help “beautify” it without the consent of the people who have inhabited it means that all these new fancy buildings will forever intrude upon the culture and foundations of the community and replace them with a more palatable version for wealthier people. But establishing a pretty glossy version of reality will not erase the very existence of the people who are suffering, no matter how thick and costly the paint that covers it. The people whose livelihoods and cultural norms are wiped away will still exist even if the upper class ignores them. 
So what is the solution to a problem of big money versus the livelihoods of impoverished individuals? In a system where corporations aren’t heavily regulated, the best form of mediation is for the local, city and state governments to step in, provide rent-controlled housing and promote steps to homeownership for longtime residents of the area. 
Beyond the protection that comes with housing stability, there also needs to be regulations put in place that prevent wealthy developers and the University from causing local businesses to shut down. USC should practice uplifting these integral keystones of South L.A., rather than perpetuating the idea that opening up a new SunLife-esque establishment is the solution to their aesthetically-related problems.

While Xiaoke Ying never watched “Jeopardy!” growing up, an email advertising the popular game show in October piqued her interest as a trivia lover. 
Months later under the blaring fluorescent lights of the Jeopardy set, Ying competed against two students from Yale University and University of Texas at Austin, fielding questions on topics such as world history and American literature. 
Ying, a sophomore majoring in business of cinematic arts, won her semifinal matchup of “Jeopardy!” College Championship Wednesday. Ying went into Final Jeopardy in third place with a score of $10,200. Ying and the two other semifinalists answered the final question on presidential geography incorrectly, but Ying wagered only $2,000, while her opponents bet the majority of their earnings, securing her a place as a finalist. 
“I wasn’t very strong in [the category] because I don’t know my presidents very well, so I figured I should just try and lose as little money as possible,” Ying said. 
Ying came in third in her quarterfinal match, but her final score of $12,800 qualified her as a wild card in the semifinals. She said the win in her second match came as a shock after trailing her two opponents most of the game. 
“It definitely felt surreal,” Ying said. “It also felt nice that now there would be some female representation in the finals.” 
Ying said that while she knew most of the responses to the questions, buzzing in quickly proved challenging under pressure. 
“In terms of the questions, I think almost all the contestants know all the answers,” Ying said. “It’s just a matter of plugging in.” 
Ying said the video game category helped her find her footing. She answered clues on the classic arcade game “Q*bert” and the game series “The Last of Us” correctly. 
“I don’t play a lot of video games, but I do watch a lot of “Let’s Play”s and things like that, so when I saw that [category] and I was able to get those answers I was really glad about it,” Ying said. 
Ying taped her matches over two days in February at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City before Gov. Gavin Newsom implemented the stay-at-home order, which requires Californians to stay indoors as much as possible to help curb the coronavirus outbreak. 
“Jeopardy!” films a week’s worth of episodes per day, so the entire College Championship occurred over 48 hours. Ying said the marathon taping style left her waiting to film her match most of the day. 
“I didn’t realize that we would be stuck in the green room all day because we weren’t allowed to watch prior episodes, so that was kind of a tiring experience,” Ying said. 
While the taping days felt long, Ying said the “Jeopardy!” crew kept the contestants focused between rounds. The coordinators helped quell any anxieties about going on live television by offering general encouragement and advice on speedily answering questions. 
“The contestant coordinators are all really great, and they come on during commercial breaks and before Final Jeopardy! to give you a pep talk and … that really made it so much better when you might be nervous about it,” Ying said. 
Ying felt proud of her performance in her first match despite her nerves. 
“I was pretty nervous about doing well and not disappointing people who knew I was gonna be there,” Ying said. 
To secure a place on the show, Ying first took an online test of 50 general knowledge questions after receiving an email about trying out for the program in October. Based on the results of the test, she then attended an in-person audition in November, which included a written exam, screen test and short interview. 
“Jeopardy!” senior contestant coordinator Corina Nusu said the second stage of the audition process narrows applicants down to 200 potential contestants. The coordinators then chose 15 college students from schools across the country to compete for the $100,000 grand prize. 
“We’re looking for contestants that are having a lot of fun with their audition, who know how to play the game,” Nusu said. 
According to Nusu, it was Ying’s dynamic audition that helped land her a spot on the show. 
“She’s very strong, she’s a very determined player — we love that,” Nusu said. “She has a vast knowledge of many different subjects, which also works to her benefit, and she was just very energetic and fun and what we were looking for [in] the show.” 
After learning she qualified for the tournament, Ying only brushed up on her geography, taking online quizzes on state capitals and bodies of water for 30 minutes a day a few weeks before the competition. But she didn’t prepare too intensely for the taping as she typically follows current events to hone her trivia knowledge. 
“I didn’t prepare much beyond what I usually do, just reading whatever I find interesting and absorbing that information,” Ying said. 
Ying said the greatest asset for her “Jeopardy!” performance was participating in quiz bowl while attending Arcadia High School, an academic competition that tests participants on general knowledge topics, including history and literature. 
“I was on quiz bowl and history bowl all four years and that was definitely a great experience with friends and it definitely did help with trivia knowledge,” Ying said. “I think everyone who was competing had been on quiz bowl in high school.”
Christopher Schultz, Ying’s high school quiz bowl adviser, emphasized her versatile trivia knowledge as vital to her success on “Jeopardy!”
“[Ying] is just generally a good all-around player whereas a lot of people have specialties when it comes to quiz bowl. We’ll usually have a kid that’s a history specialist, another person that’s a literature specialist and so on,” Schultz said. “She works as an all-around person, she could answer questions in every category.” 
Schultz also said that Ying consistently competed in quiz bowl tournaments against other high schools throughout her four years on the team. She also went with one of the two qualifying teams from Arcadia to the National Academy Quiz Tournament her sophomore through senior years. 
“Over the course of the time that she was at Arcadia High School, she played in 27 tournaments, which is a lot and ended up being more than any other player that we’ve had in the last [few] years or so,” Schultz said. 
–
Ying said that while she took the competition seriously, she most enjoyed befriending the other contestants. 
“All of us who were there have become really close, and we still talk every day in a group chat, and we have Zoom calls almost every week,” Ying said. 
Ying will compete in the two-day championship final Thursday and Friday against students from the University of Minnesota and Indiana University.

Discussing policy issues is not uncommon for high school and college students, but junior Serena Allen said she noticed that oftentimes she and her peers don’t have the evidence to support their arguments or are immediately intimidated by the jargon and specifics of policy topics. 
In hopes of getting her and her peers’ questions answered, Allen, who is majoring in public policy, created “The Policy Paycheck,” a podcast launched last month dedicated to breaking down major policy issues and analyzing them without bias in easily comprehensible terms. In an effort to think past party lines, “The Policy Paycheck” aims to strictly focus on the data of policy topics ranging from immigration to taxation through conversations with experts and academics in their respective fields. 
Allen said she believes that the podcast can teach high school seniors preparing to enter college how to argue their ideas and support them with facts and evidence, a skill she thinks is not adequately taught in high school government and civics classes. 
“No policy is as simple as being black and white or right or wrong,” Allen said. “By looking at the nonpartisan lens and the economic side of it, you can kind of take the information you learn from the podcasts and the experts and then be able to make your own decision about what you believe and be able to back it up with something that is helpful to those that you’re discussing these issues with.”
Allen said she wanted the podcast’s content and rhetoric to remain nonpartisan to keep the focus on the foundational facts of policy matters rather than their political interpretations. Not only does she aim to provide information on policy topics, but she said she also hopes to shed light on the misconceptions that divide U.S. political parties. 
“It seems a lot of the time, there’s just certain buzzwords one side uses or the other, even when they’re talking about the same idea,” Allen said. “I think that there’s a huge misconception in American politics that the other side has different goals, when really, everyone’s main goal is to help the American people and to best serve them and the country and make it as beneficial as possible. And so, a lot of the miscommunication I think comes from just not knowing about numbers.”
To publish the podcast, Allen partnered with the USC Bedrosian Center, a research institute in the Price School of Public Policy that focuses on shaping public dialogue surrounding policy issues by sharing information. Aubrey Hicks, the executive director of the Bedrosian Center, believes that Allen’s goal of remaining nonpartisan is an important one when the intent is primarily to inform her audience and prepare them to make their own decisions. 
“When we talk about policy and economics, they get so muddled in partisanship, and [Allen’s] idea is to get underneath that,” Hicks said. “I think [Allen] comes with such an open mind to really look at the bigger picture and the sort of what underlies all of this partisanship and how can we get to a place where we have enough information to make our own decisions, regardless of party and politics and all of those sorts of propaganda.”
Allen said she chose podcasting as her medium because it allows her to ask experts clarifying questions in real time and lighten dense economic topics through casual conversation. 
“I think it’s helpful that I really don’t know — I’m not an expert on any of these topics,” Allen said. “I’m just an undergraduate who’s interested in learning about all these different topics and having the facts to back up anything I believe in. I think a lot of people have an interest in pursuing the same thing in policy and understanding policies.”
“The Policy Paycheck” has published two episodes to date, the first about taxes and government spending and the second discussing health care programs including Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. Its digestibility is one of the most defining features of its production and content, according to Allen’s peers. 
Corey Hedden, a video producer at Price Video Service, edits Allen’s audio. He said that in working with her he was eager to learn about public policy by listening to “The Policy Paycheck,” despite lacking a background in the field. 
“A lot of the stuff we [at Price Video Service] do — some of it kind of goes over my head because it’s not as familiar — but [Allen’s] podcast is designed for high school students, and it’s actually one of the more interesting things I’ve worked on because it helps me understand it much more easily and clearly,” Hedden said.
“The Policy Paycheck” logo was designed by Jordan Williams, a junior majoring in art. Williams also said the podcast is successful because of its content’s accessibility in addition to its wide availability on streaming services and the Bedrosian Center’s website.
“I think it works really well at sort of making it accessible to a lot of people where it’s pretty easy to tune in,” Williams said. “It was really breaking down a lot of these big important political discussions that [high school and college students] will be affected by pretty soon and making it something that everyone can sort of grasp and understand.”
More “The Policy Paycheck” episodes will be posted in the upcoming weeks, totaling eight episodes for the first season. Allen said she hopes to produce more seasons and tackle more topics as she collects suggestions from her audience. 
“I’m happy that people are gaining what I was hoping to do with that product,” Allen said. “I’m really excited to get more of the marketing out so I can better suit the needs of our audience and have more people listen to it and do more episodes.”

Having to video call my family in the late hours of the night to counter the time difference between Los Angeles and Mumbai, India, cooking to brighten up my days and furthering a hobby despite not having roommates around to share my food with — this is my new normal.
A twinge of homesickness hits when I wake up to texts informing me that the rest of my family and extended relatives in Asia spent hours playing a board game on an online platform while I was asleep. As an international student at USC, social distancing and quarantine have brought with it a unique set of challenges. They are small things, granted, and I remain grateful for financial stability, the (virtual) support of my friends and loved ones and the routine that online classes offer. But the small things add up. 
And when they add up, they widen the gap between my experiences and those of my friends, the majority of whom happen to be from this country. USC has felt like home for more than two years now, and I credit that to my community of friends, who, with each passing semester, made me feel less like a foreigner and helped me believe that this was where I belonged. 
But in a time where these friends have moved to social distance in the comfort of their family homes and the adrenaline-pumping nonstop nature of college that leaves little time for homesickness has eased, my sense of belonging starts to waver. When the orders to stay at home were first announced, people around me sighed about having to “go home” for quarantine. But for someone who’s spent almost three years trying to make campus feel like my new home, what does “going home” even mean? 
Coming to college approximately 7,000 miles away from home meant branching out and making a space for myself in the world. True, it was never explicit; I was never told that I had to move away and have a home of my own post graduation, but for as long as I can remember, it seemed inevitable that I would travel to a different continent, to a city where I knew absolutely no one, to pursue an education that would allow me to live an independent life. There is little space in that narrative for what you are supposed to do when your education, the primary purpose behind that life, is functionally put on pause. 
At a time when visa restrictions are in flux, when travel bans are self-imposed by other nations, and when both the administration’s rhetoric and federal policies within the United States are increasingly unpredictable, the safest option for international students seems to be to “stick it out.” To stay here — perhaps alone, on or near a campus that has likely become a ghost town — is to avoid the possibility of being told that once this is all over, we might not be able to return despite the fact that this is now where we call home. To evade being caught on the wrong end of American travel restrictions, staying away from family for a few months seems a fair price to pay. After all, making it on our own is a force of habit by now. 
“Why come all this way for college?” is a question I have heard time and time again in the last few years. The promise of a more prestigious education, perhaps? Or, more accurately, the promise of a land of endless opportunities? Not being American does not mean that I escaped growing up with the ideals of the American dream. But now, with federal social distancing policies here lacking in comparison to those facing my family back home and the growing rate of coronavirus cases throwing into sharp relief the flaws in this “more developed” American system of governance and health care, I begin to wonder if studying abroad, as we sometimes jokingly refer to it as, is deserving of the rose-tinted glasses we international kids are taught to look at it with. 
It may not be rose-tinted anymore, but I am still beyond grateful for the experiences studying in the United States have brought. Staying away from my family is not easy, but the unending support from friends who know I am weathering this storm alone is a constant reminder of all that I have gained. 
Reach out to your international friends, even if it is just a text to remind them that you are there for them. The knowledge that our Trojan family is here to support us goes a long way.

Angelos Gaviotis begins his day after the sun is past its peak, around 3 p.m., joining his family for breakfast when they are eating lunch. By the time Gaviotis prepares for his classes, the Dubai skyline outside his window is dark — Gaviotis peers at his bright laptop screen starting at 8 p.m., his classes often lasting until 5 a.m.
“My daily schedule is completely flipped,” said Gaviotis, who returned to Dubai during spring break. “I work at night, I go to classes at night and I sleep during the day.” 
Colleges across the nation have swapped in-person lectures with online classes in an effort to curb face-to-face interactions due to the coronavirus. Following USC’s decision to transition all classes to online mid-March, many international students immediately dispersed to their home countries. 
Though the University has required all online lectures to be recorded, students across the globe are united in their struggle in maintaining the momentum from the first half of the semester amid the change in their environments.
When asked for a comment on specific accommodations USC has made for international students, USC redirected the Daily Trojan to the University’s online guide for students. 
USC created the Student Basic Need Fund to assist students who have encountered unexpected financial burdens due to the coronavirus, which is open to the entire student body.
“If I don’t go to class live so I can ask questions and see the teacher talk, it’ll be tougher for me to stay up to date on my classwork,” said Gaviotis, a sophomore majoring in economics and mathematics. “I feel like if I actually go to the class on time, I’m more enticed to do it.”
Using Gulf Standard Time, Dubai is 11 hours ahead of California, a nearly perfect reversal of mornings and evenings.
The University recommended all students who must travel overseas to contact the Office of International Services to address potential visa complications amid ongoing travel restrictions across the world.
Many students from countries outside of the United States find the loss of an on-campus, in-person college experience has undercut their original expectations for their spring semester in Los Angeles.
“It’s discouraging, especially as international students,” said Zuzanna Iwanejko, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law who is taking her classes from Poland. “We went to USC to physically be there and get to know our professors and use the resources USC provides for us.”
With daily schedules entirely altered, students are finding difficulties in adjusting to unfamiliar routines. 
“I really am a morning person,” said Iwanejko, whose classes run until midnight. “Just having everything in the evening influenced my participation a little bit because I’m more tired in the evening, perhaps less engaged.”
For Katherine Yang, a sophomore majoring in media arts and practice, returning to Hong Kong created an array of problems for her core classes. In a studio class for her major heavily based on discussion and collaboration with other cohort members, the transition to online meetings has offered clear shortcomings.
“If you’re working in breakout sessions in a classroom, you can still overhear certain things or say something to the entire group or walk over and look at somebody else’s work,” Yang said. “Those things can’t be built organically into something like Zoom.”
Centered on group projects, Yang’s studio class required students to create an experimental game exploring speculative design methods.
To adapt to the new online format, Yang’s professor adjusted the class to utilize more breakout sessions — none of which Yang can attend as they run from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. in her local zone. 
Yang contributes to her group project in her own time, removed from the active discussion and moments of creative bursts among her classmates during the sessions.
“Having to just watch the recordings and trying to work with my group members at other times, it’s a big loss for me,” she said.
Yang’s experience is shared with many students overseas who were forced to make drastic changes to their daily schedules. 
“It just doesn’t seem real right now,” said Audrey Yang, a freshman majoring in neuroscience and economics, who is attending classes from Taiwan. “I don’t have a routine anymore, which is really messing up everything because I feel like I’m slacking on assignments at the same time.”
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep across the globe, students are scrambling to balance their focus between the outbreak and their academics.
“With everything going on, it’s just so depressing that you feel like this isn’t that important anymore,” Audrey Yang said.
Internet strengths often highly vary from country to country, leaving students with poorer connections finding themselves unable to consistently attend Zoom classes.
“I have four routers in my house … and I still get kicked out,” Iwanejko said. “There are some classes that are definitely harder, especially big lectures, because I have so many people, the server is overcrowded [and] I tend to get kicked out of the system.”
Poland’s unsteady internet connection prevents Iwanejko from being able to join meetings with her video on, making her the only student in her Chinese language class without it.
Though reluctant to replace live lectures with recordings, Iwanejko said she may need to in the future because of a shift in her mental health from an increased sense of urgency throughout her day.
“After a week of attending classes [in my timezone] and waking up late, I felt a difference in my personal well-being,” Iwanejko said. “It’s harder for me to manage my time more effectively because I have less time between when I wake up and my classes.”
Some overseas students have faced an additional obstacle during their reentry: government-mandated quarantines. 
Singapore, South Korea and Poland are a few of the countries that require all individuals who have entered the country to use a government tracking app during their self-quarantine. Poland’s app necessitates users to send periodic selfies to prove their location, notifying the police if there’s no response within 20 minutes.
On top of transitioning to a new time zone, Iwanejko also didn’t have a Polish SIM card, prompting police officers to physically check up on her nearly every day of her two-week period of self-quarantine. On every visit, police confirmed Iwanejko was in quarantine and Iwanejko would explain her phone situation.
“I think out of 14 days, they came 10 times, one of which was twice in the same day,” Iwanejko said. 
When Emily Lu, a senior majoring in media arts and practice and visual and performing arts studies, returned to Hong Kong, she and her sister who attends Princeton University had to quarantine themselves in a hotel room for two weeks to prevent possibly spreading the coronavirus to their family. 
As a member of USC’s hip-hop dance team Chaotic 3, Lu used her passion for hip-hop to help cope with her situation as she danced in her hotel room to pass time. Lu and other members of Chaotic 3 began sending videos of themselves to each other dancing from their respective locations, continuing the group’s engagement despite being separated.
“I’ll stay connected with my other friends who are also going through this … just being a support system for each other since these are nearly unprecedented circumstances,” Lu said.
With more than 1,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, Hong Kong began implementing electronic wristbands that track the location of its user on March 19.
With the complications that arise from international flights, travel restrictions and ever-changing border policies, USC’s swift decision to permanently move this semester’s classes online because of the coronavirus forced international students to rapidly plan changes for the semester.
The United Arab Emirates temporarily blocked visa holders from entering the country on March 19, less than a week after the University declared classes would be moved online.
“I’m very happy with how quickly USC made the decision to close classes and go into Zoom,” Gaviotis said. “If they hadn’t told us before spring break, I would’ve been stuck outside of Dubai and wouldn’t have been able to come back to my family.”
Despite the inevitable timezone conflict, students said they’d rather be in the safety of their own homes.
“Ultimately, would you rather be stuck in the U.S. or stuck in your home country?” Katherine Yang said. “I think a lot of people would prefer the latter.”

Price School of Public Policy vice dean Neeraj Sood launched a study Friday testing Los Angeles County residents for immunity to the coronavirus. The project, launched in partnership with the L.A. County Department of Public Health and L.A. County Chief Science Officer Dr. Paul Simon, will identify individuals who have contracted and developed antibodies to combat the virus.
Over the weekend, researchers tested 1,000 adults, selected randomly through market research firm Lieberman Research Worldwide, Inc., at six locations throughout the county.  The researchers designed the sample to approximately reflect the racial demographic breakdown of L.A. County to provide a more accurate estimate of immunity to the coronavirus across the county’s population.
The test determines whether a subject has antibodies that combat coronavirus pathogens, which result from exposure to and contraction of the virus. If the test, which takes 10 to 30 minutes to the time results are ready to read, comes back positive, the subject has developed immunity and has minimal risk for contracting or spreading the virus.
By testing a large number of people, it will be easier to determine how many have contracted the virus and recovered, which will give a better estimate of the virus’ hospitalization and mortality rates.
“If COVID is, say, less deadly than the flu, then maybe we might say, ‘Hey, we can open up our economy, or we can ease some of the restrictions we have right now,’” Sood said. “But if COVID turns out to be 10 times more deadly than the flu, then you will be like, ‘No, we cannot open up our economy — we’ve got to be more careful about it.’”
The research team will repeat the testing with different 1,000-subject samples every two to three weeks, Sood said. The periodic tests will provide longitudinal data about the proportion of county residents who develop immunity over the course of the pandemic and when cases begin to plateau.
According to a press release from the L.A. County Department of Public Health and the Price school, antibody testing may enable certain employees to return to work without becoming ill or spreading the coronavirus.
“Testing for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19, in addition to testing for the absence of the virus itself using traditional COVID-19 tests, could potentially identify those who can enter the workforce with minimal risk of infecting others or getting infected themselves,” the press release read.
According to Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman, Student Health is working with health officials around the nation to track the success and feasibility of antibody testing and the possibility of implementing it at USC in the future.
“There’s a lot of conversation about the use of antibody testing as a way to determine, ‘Are people immune?’” Van Orman said. “Right now, what we know about antibody testing is that we don’t know enough to make a good recommendation on it.”
Sood said he hopes that with testing, individuals who have recovered from the coronavirus can be flagged as potential plasma donors. Research has shown that injections of plasma from people immune to the virus can help coronavirus patients recover, he said.
Sood plans to discuss with the National Institutes of Health’s Institutional Review Board, which prevents mistreatment of human subjects in research, the possibility of sharing information of subjects who test positive for coronavirus antibodies with scientists looking into plasma treatment.
The study will continue through the coming months until the end of the pandemic or the depletion of funds, Sood said. He plans to present his findings to colleagues in his field and use the results to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of measures like social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
“If the number of infections is rising rapidly, then it says stay-at-home is not working,” Sood said. “If the number of infections have remained flat or are not rising, then that might say stay-at-home is working. Plus, this tells us when the epidemic might end.”

Singer-songwriter Jessica Harper has always had a wide-ranging music taste — something that has translated into her own art. She grew up with this tangled taste in music — from listening to rock artists like AC/DC and Led Zeppelin to classical pop musicians like Frank Sinatra, Harper eventually found her own niche, bringing a classical feeling to rock music.
Harper, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, started singing for strangers in Target when she was only a toddler. In second grade, she joined her school’s musicals, which allowed her to showcase her talent more openly. 
From the beginning, Harper’s family has supported her love for music. 
“My family loves music, so we were always listening to it and singing along, and it was a very community-based thing,” Harper said. “It was always just kind of a part of my life.”
Although no one in her family pursued a career in music, her relatives have supported her in all of her endeavors and encouraged her to take the steps necessary to help her pursue her own. When Harper expressed her desire to attend an art boarding school in high school, her parents were initially reluctant to let her join, but they ultimately supported her as they saw her passion for music grow.
Harper’s high school journey wasn’t a typical one to say the least. When she first joined the boarding school, she went in with a focus on opera music. As soon as she discovered the variety of programs that were available, she decided to pursue songwriting. This experience gave her the opportunity to collaborate with individuals in other programs, including the dance and visual arts programs. 
“It was just this beautiful, collaborative, artistic place that just let us try new things,” Harper said. “Especially in the songwriting program, my teachers never tried to make me be a certain genre or write about a certain topic. They tried to push me in every direction so I could figure out which one I wanted.” 
Sean Holt, a USC alumnus, faculty member and mentor to Harper, has known her since she joined his sophomore songwriting music cohort a few years ago. Outside of his classes, Holt works with students to find ways they can pursue a more long-term career in music. 
“I don’t focus too much with my students necessarily on any particular outcome that they’re going to achieve — I’m much more interested in a continued process in their careers,” Holt said. “The beautiful thing is that anything we lay claim to right now may not even be as cool as what is possible for [Harper’s] career. She’s certainly got all of the capability and skill to be the next megastar, and she could also enjoy a really great career as an effective songwriter.”
Harper doesn’t take her title as an artist lightly. Her music aims to provide people a way to escape the realities of their everyday lives and to give them a sense of safety and comfort when they need it most, she said.
“I just want people to be in touch with their emotions and to provide an outlet for them to connect with something if they wouldn’t normally get to express those things,” Harper said. “I feel like the general population represses their emotions a lot for the sake of other people and the job of artists is to release that for them.”
Rather than writing about typical love stories, Harper adds her own twist to make her music relatable. She expresses her personal struggles in her music while also writing about social issues important to  Generation Z, including body positivity and wellness, to spark vital conversations.
“I do write a lot about whatever I’m struggling with emotionally,” Harper said. “I write a lot about eating disorders because I struggled with one for a long time, and stuff about body image and self-love.”
Writing has always been the best outlet for Harper to process her emotions, so when it came to eating disorders, she wrote about her own relationship with food. This topic was a sensitive and personal one for her, which made it difficult to explicitly write about, so she got comfortable writing in metaphors to help her mask the intensity of the topic, she said.
Another mentor of Harper’s, USC alumnus Michael Arrom, has instructed her in piano. Arrom is a strong supporter and advocate for Harper’s unique lyricism and the messages behind her music.
“Her music can mean something different to every listener,” Arrom said. “I find that every song paints a different picture as well. [What] I personally hear throughout her music is a love of life, whether in the beautiful, the tragic, or the bizarre — she explores everything.”
Throughout the time Arrom has worked with her, he said he sees great potential in Harper and a long-lasting future, no matter how she decides to orient her music career.
“Jess has a very bright future with a lot of potential avenues,” Arrom said. “She’s an unbelievably talented singer-songwriter and her interests and skills go far beyond that. She has a great intuition for stitching together sounds and textures. She’s a curious and collaborative learner, so where she wants to go is up to her … I don’t see Jess being confined to a single path.”
Harper said she aims to continue her career in music, whether it’s touring around the world as a singer, working on her own artist projects or even writing for other musicians. 
“I want my artist projects to be a balance of socially conscious while still being a fun live experience,” Harper said. “So the subject matter of the songs a lot of times would be focused on things that I want to further, or open up a dialogue about, while the music of the songs themselves would be just something that everyone would jam to.”
You can listen to Harper’s EP “Michigan,” which is available on all platforms including Apple Music and Spotify. Be on the lookout for a music video for her song “Rainy Day,” projected to come out at the end of April or early May.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed a resolution with eleven of twelve votes in support of establishing permanent resources for undocumented students at its meeting Tuesday. 
The resolution, authored by Improving Dreams, Education, Access, and Success executive director Valeria Resendiz and Sens. Kevin Gutierrez and Ruben Romeo, was first presented at last week’s meeting. The resolution faced 21 amendments before approval, including the inclusion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status students in the resolution, which it had not explicitly mentioned when introduced. 
“A lot of the amendments that we made were to make the language consistent throughout, being DACA, TPS and undocumented students,” Gutierrez said. 
One amendment called for USC administrators to release an official statement to publicly express their dedication to initiatives and resources for DACA, TPS and undocumented USC students, including legal counseling, admission and financial aid assistance and mental health and services accessibility, similar to when IDEAS met with President Carol Folt and Vice President Winston Crisp in December to discuss new resources for the community, including a centralized center. The amendment also urged administrators to create a position to directly support this community during the coronavirus pandemic and oversee the transition of the pop-up DREAMer center into an Undocumented Trojan Resource Center. 
“IDEAS has met previously with Dr. Folt and Winston Crisp and has also gotten their support in person, but again, this is calling for a sort of written statement,” Gutierrez said. 
The Senate also approved the appointments of cabinet, legislative, funding, programming and communications branch officers for the 2020-21 school year. More than 100 applications were received to fill approximately 80 open positions. 
The Senate also approved a resolution in support of incorporating the Native American Student Assembly into the programming branch, which would allow the organization to receive official recognition and funding from USG after successfully passing a semester-long trial period as a cultural assembly. In February, the Native American Student Union was one group that pushed for an amendment that would allow cultural organizations to become recognized student assemblies by submitting a petition signed by at least 50 undergraduate students, allowing organizations representing smaller communities to more easily gain necessary funding and resources from USG.

Galen Center’s court was packed for the first time in nearly a month Tuesday, but not for the usual reasons. Donors showed up in droves for a blood drive that ran from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., hosted by USC Athletics and the American Red Cross.
American Red Cross external communications manager Christine Welch said that the blood could be donated to sickle cell patients, patients with bloodborne cancers, accident victims and patients undergoing organ transplants. The drive came less than a month after the Red Cross declared severe blood shortages in the Los Angeles area due to blood drive cancellations caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
“We had a great turnout,” Welch said. “Thank you to the Trojan community and the Southern California community for coming out and rolling up a sleeve to donate and help save lives.”
Though COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted by blood, USC Athletics and the Red Cross still had to take extra precautions to ensure that donors and health care workers alike were following public health protocol — whenever possible.
“Everyone in the building is wearing masks,” USC associate athletic director Hatcher Parnell said. “We have our six-foot social distancing at check in, everything [is] spread out pretty well. There’s still the close touch when [donors] get their screenings but other than that, everybody’s abiding by the social distancing and [wearing] masks and gloves and [doing] everything that we’re supposed to be doing.”
Welch said that in a usual blood drive, the Red Cross takes several measures to ensure proper sanitation and safety such as disinfecting equipment, using facemasks, wiping down surfaces that have been touched by donors and changing out gloves frequently. 
Amid the pandemic, Welch said those procedures have been taken to another level. 
“There’s a number of new safety protocols that have been put into place for a few weeks now,” Welch said. “And that includes taking your temperature before entering the drive, screening for health symptoms — again, and that includes travel to coronavirus-risk countries … So there’s a number of safety protocols that are put into place to keep it a healthy and safe environment.”
Hatcher said the athletic department values helping the local community and that partnering with the Red Cross for the blood drive was a great way to do so. Athletic director Mike Bohn called it “the most important game of the year” in a statement announcing the drive on April 3, and the big screen at Galen Center during the drive portrayed that message as well.
“It’s something near and dear to our president [Carol Folt] and to my senior staff here in athletics,” Parnell said of assisting the surrounding community. “It’s one of those things that we’re really passionate about — helping the community — and in this time of need and the Red Cross needs blood, it’s the right thing to do and we’re here to assist whenever we can help save lives.”
Welch said that the partnership between the Red Cross and USC Athletics had been facilitated through the Red Cross L.A. humanitarian services branch of the organization. 
“We heard USC had a great space to hold a blood drive that would support social distancing, allow us to put the donor beds appropriately spaced apart, waiting areas, etc.,” Welch said. “So we appreciate the support of USC in opening their doors to provide the space and support a type of a blood drive where we can still put into place those safety protocols while still collecting blood in a great environment.”
Parnell said he hopes the event will spur businesses and other universities to follow USC’s footsteps amid the pandemic. 
“USC likes to be a leader in the community,” Parnell said. “And this blood drive kind of helps us do that. So, hopefully, other institutions, other companies, etc. see this and if the Red Cross comes a-knocking, hopefully they can step up as well.”

The truest mark of resilience is the ability to make something horrible work in your favor. The NBA has the opportunity to do just that as the end of its season continues to be postponed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The NBA Playoffs were supposed to start Saturday, kicking off two months of highly intense action (well, apart from the first round, which generally features a lot of lopsided four- and five-game series). Instead, we’re still sitting here waiting just to see if the regular season will ever come back.
For weeks now, the suspension has prompted discussion of when the league might return, but with the possibility of the start of the playoffs being pushed all the way to the summer, some have begun championing the idea that the league should push its regular season back permanently.
This idea actually arose nearly a week before the league’s suspension. On March 6, at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston, Atlanta Hawks CEO Steve Koonin proposed moving the league’s start time back from mid-October to mid-December. This would, in turn, shift the start of the playoffs to June, with the Finals kicking off in August. The NBA Draft and Summer League would also be pushed back, with both likely occupying a September time slot.
Interesting when you lay it out:Mid-June- start of the NBA playoffsEarly August- NBA FinalsEnd of August- DraftSept. 1- Start of FASept. 10- Summer/fall leagueDec. 10- training camp opensDec. 25- regular season opens (82 games)Mid-June- NBA season ends
The idea makes sense because it places the NBA in a more advantageous spot on the sports calendar. The NFL is not only the dominant sports television property in the country right now, it also has the highest ratings of any TV program. NFL games made up 78 of the 100 most-watched telecasts in 2019, according to the Sports Business Journal.
Koonin made his proposal amid falling viewership for the NBA this season. There is concern that the league’s popular momentum from this last decade has faltered. 
“Relevance equals revenue,” Koonin said. “We’ve got to create the most relevance, and the revenue will fix itself.”
The NBA doesn’t have the capability of competing with the NFL right now, so moving out of the fall (also allowing it to avoid college football) would help on its own. However, the NBA wouldn’t simply be fleeing from the television behemoth that is football. 
Moving the NBA’s best product — the playoffs and Finals — into the summer, known to be a dead period in sports when the only thing going on is MLB’s regular season, gives the NBA a chance to carve out a section of the calendar of its own, similar to how football dominates the fall.
There are some potential issues to consider. People generally want to vacation during the summer months, so the shift might backfire and hurt viewership during the league’s most significant stretch. Free agency would also be pushed back into the football season, which would draw attention away from the period that actually generates the most attention for the NBA.
However, the league might have a built-in out. If the playoffs are able to resume this season on a schedule similar to the one listed above, this season could act as a test run. If it plays out and works the way I think it might — great! If it flops and ratings bottom out, then the league will know not to do the same thing again. 
Even if viewership tanks in the summer, the circumstances of the pandemic will serve as a security blanket against any retrospective criticism of the shift and whatever revenue the league gets is still preferable to none. 
According to reports, the league is pretty open to the idea. If it proceeds, it will be interesting to see what other decisions the NBA makes in accordance. Christmas Day has long been the unofficial start of the NBA season, but will it become the actual start to the season if the league chooses to implement the change? Will the league double up on changes and experiment by adding a midseason tournament with playoff implications? Who knows, but the possibilities will be there. 
The NBA has been the most progressive league for a while now. Commissioner Adam Silver has proven that he is not beholden to the traditions of the sport if they aren’t the most beneficial option for players and the league’s reputation. Most of his big decisions have been made to uphold the integrity of the NBA’s brand and allow its stars to use their own voices, such as his ouster of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling and his vocal defense of players criticizing President Trump. 
Those were important and correct decisions on Silver’s part, and he’s gained a lot of popularity among players and the media because of them. But now Silver has the chance to get creative in a big structural way. Perhaps he’ll come to the decision that shifting the league schedule back isn’t feasible, but we’re going to find out over the following months just how far the NBA’s doctrine of forward thinking extends.
