The Pac-12 Conference announced a partnership with diagnostic testing company Quidel Corporation Thursday including coronavirus testing that could be conducted daily and allows for results to be returned in as little as 15 minutes.
Each of the Pac-12 athletic departments is expected to receive its machines and tests by the end of September. 
In a press release announcing the partnership, the conference said the new testing could accelerate the timeline for the return to competition, as the infrequency of testing and the lag in results turnaround contributed to the conference’s mid-August decision to postpone all sports until 2021. 
“This is a major step toward the safe resumption of Pac-12 sport competitions,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in the release. “The availability of a reliable test that can be administered daily, with almost immediate results, addresses one of the key concerns that was expressed by our medical advisory committee, as well as by student-athletes, coaches and others.”
The press release also said the testing program will help reduce the level of necessary contact tracing and ease the burden on local health officials as spread among athletes is significantly reduced. 
“Our partnership with Quidel, the industry leader in point-of-care antigen testing, will provide crucial research data that will benefit our members’ communities as well as the entire country,” Scott said in the release.
In a media press conference Thursday, Scott said that he is hopeful the testing arrangement will allow basketball season to begin before Jan. 1 and that the conference will continue to reevaluate the start date of football season, with both 2020 and 2021 potential starts in mind. 
The testing program will apply to all close-contact sports at each university, with the 15-minute results period allowing for infection incidents to be isolated.
The testing system will begin in a research phase to see if the rapid testing immediately prior to practices or competitions can decrease or even eliminate the risk of infection through sporting events. It will also study how the virus operates in asymptomatic individuals. 
Dr. Doug Aukerman, Oregon State senior associate athletic director of sports medicine and chair of the Pac-12 Student-Athlete Health and Well-Being Initiative Board, said in the release that research will have an effect beyond college sports as well. 
“This will allow us to learn even more about the behavior of the virus, especially in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals,” Aukerman said. “The implication is that this can inform the broader medical community on asymptomatic cases as well as our care and treatment for student-athletes.”
Scott reiterated in the press conference that while the testing program is likely to reduce the spread of the virus among student-athletes, the Pac-12 will still require clearance from member schools’ local health authorities before returning to competition. Many of the Pac-12’s schools, including USC and UCLA, currently do not have such clearance.

For months, public health officials have been warning about a twindemic caused by the doubling of flu season and the coronavirus pandemic, encouraging people to get their flu shots. At USC, these concerns led to the implementation of a shortened, earlier semester set to finish before Thanksgiving break when initial hybrid plans were announced. Now, outdoor stations have been set up around campus for students to get their flu shots, a decision made with social distancing guidelines in mind. 
As the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise in the United States, health experts are advising people to get the flu vaccination before this year’s flu season starts. According to Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman, USC Student Health is currently accepting appointments for students to get vaccinated. 
“We are scheduling appointments, so what that means is that rather than people walking up, we really are spacing people out,” Van Orman said. “Our teams that are giving the flu shots are wearing full [personal protective equipment], people are waiting in lines six feet apart.”  
Similar to its on-campus coronavirus testing efforts, Student Health has moved flu shot stations outside. Instead of coming into the clinic for their shots, students  go to an outdoor tent during their scheduled time. This protective measure considers students who worry about going into a clinic and getting infected. 
“One of the things we are learning about this is, because of the nature of the air solation of the virus, indoors appears to be a part of the problem,” Van Orman said. “Where possible, particularly something like flu shots, where we know it’s a lot of folks, we’ve actually moved it outside.” 
Students who are selected for free asymptomatic coronavirus population testing through Student Health are also encouraged to get their flu shot and can do so at two locations at the University Park Campus — Pardee Tower and Parkside. Student Health said it had administered 1,060 flu shots as of Wednesday.
Aaron Wang, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, lives near campus and said he would get a flu shot at one of the outdoor sites after seeing how Student Health has handled coronavirus testing in a serious manner.
“Recently, I’ve been able to go on campus a couple of times to get my Color COVID test, and I felt that the measures that they’ve been taking in order to make sure that the campus is an accessible environment are pretty safe,” Wang said. “As long as they continue to uphold the seriousness of the situation, I think that most students that I interacted with, including myself, wouldn’t be against getting a flu shot on campus.”
Will Chambers, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, plans to get a flu shot but said he would feel more comfortable going to an outside clinic rather than Student Health. He worries that going on campus to get the shot will put him at greater risk for contracting the coronavirus from another student who’s infected and may not know it. 
“For the most part, that’s definitely a good idea to have a setup similar to the way COVID testing is happening on campus with having things socially distanced and outside,” Chambers said. “But I still think that you run the risk of having infected people show up and get flu shots and have infection spread.”
Nicole Levi, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, typically goes to a pharmacy for her flu shots, but after hearing about Student Health’s outdoor stations, she said she is thinking about getting vaccinated at USC instead.
“I would totally consider going to Student Health,” Levi said. “I might even do that instead of going to CVS or somewhere like I normally do, just because it makes me more comfortable knowing that they’re doing it outside, that they have masks. I know CVS and stores like that are really crowded, and I feel a little bit worried about doing it indoors.”
Levi said despite Student Health’s safety efforts, getting vaccinated at the same location that students are being tested for the coronavirus raises a concern for her.
“I’ve been a little bit worried about testing because I think the people in line might be people who are experiencing symptoms,” Levi said. “So if it’s in the same spot as the flu shot, that’s one thing I’d be a little bit worried about.” 
Student Health has been offering flu shots early, and it plans to open a new site at USC Village, giving access to more off-campus students.  
Wang said more students may be inclined to get vaccinated at USC Village since students frequent the area to purchase groceries and likely aren’t on campus often with online classes.
“There’s a lot of students who do their daily shopping at Trader Joe’s or Target,” Wang said. “I think adding one of the sites at the Village would be an excellent way of incentivizing students to get their shots.” 
Chambers said that a station at USC Village will most likely lead to more people going to get their shots but that students should decide whether or not they feel comfortable going onto campus as case numbers continue to rise among students. 
“I think the University’s decision right now is the best they can come up with given everything that we know about COVID and this upcoming flu season,” Chambers said. “[The University] should be congratulated for their efforts in some ways, but also, you have to take whatever measures are being taken with a grain of salt because there’s no way to know how safe anything is until you get to the backside of things and you see how many people get infected as a result of it.”
Students can schedule a flu shot appointment through their MySHR Portal.

In her viral hit song, “In the Party,” 20-year-old Alabama rapper Flo Milli wisely quips “I smoked all his weed and I told him to leave (goodbye).” Beyond the hysterical giggling this line always elicits from me and my friends, lies the sheer ingenuity of her mind in writing it: the subversion of male hegemony in cannabis circles.
Forgive me, but I’m going to reach a little, taking these lyrics and running with them.
The backbone of this column is an axiom I’ve repeated countless times: The cannabis industry, just like every other industry, is (say it with me now) inherently flawed, an unjust product of its racialized, classed and gendered history. 
We’ve seen this manifestation in the overplayed media trope of the middle-class white stoner bro. It’s self-evident in the direct relationship between the increasing numbers of Black and brown people who have been incarcerated for weed-related offenses and the unabated growth of decriminalization legislation passed across the country. I could list countless other concerns specific to the cannabis space, but now I want to spotlight one key issue that directly ties into all of them: gender.
As with all behaviors, cannabis consumption and acquisition are heavily gendered. In a 2020 review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, qualitative research showed that adolescents perform gender through cannabis use, often playing into gender stereotypes and the myth of the gender binary.  
While girl smokers were deemed overtly giggly and foolish — if not completely deviant for engaging in consumption — boy smokers were perceived as laid back and cool. Further, men performed traditional masculinity by supplying cannabis, rolling joints and engaging in competitive drug taking with their male peers in an attempt to show dominance in outsmoking others.
In the same vein, women were observed as performing traditional femininity by not being the suppliers of cannabis, instead relying on their relationships with men for access. Within the traditional framework of masculinity embedded in cannabis use, this is alarming — if not dangerous — at best. 
In a study quoted in the review, one male user identifies how cannabis and kickback scenarios can facilitate private moments where one can “steal” a woman away to have an intimate conversation. 
Within the gendered contexts of cannabis use, situations where men unashamedly lord the fact that they willfully provided free cannabis to women over their heads, pressuring them into unsafe sexual environments, become not only common, but are far too often the norm. Not to mention, their direct access to the supply to potentially lace or meddle with the substance (as if the drug’s intoxicating effects aren’t enough) are equally as probable, just as they are horrifying. 
A simple first-hand example is college dorm room parties, where sexual assault rates are already sky high. And when you factor in cannabis’ natural effects — including fixation, short term memory loss, increased confusion and lack of coordination and oftentimes heightened joy and paranoia — you see a pattern emerge, where men having control of that space and the supply is a recipe for disaster.
Of course, as with most things, these spaces are mere microcosms of the industry itself, aggravations of the market’s decadeslong campaign of hypersexualizing women to sell products. In the 1990s and 2000s, cannabis was a boys’ club, evident by a “Boobs and Bongs” marketing tactic that plastered naked women paired with cannabis paraphernalia on the front covers of popular magazines such as High Times. 
When cannabis first emerged out of its sociopolitically constructed criminality, women weren’t seen as consumers but the sentient equivalent of pipes, grinders and blunts — accessories to the weed men were smoking. 
Even now, sexism remains a prevalent issue within cannabis spaces, with women dealing with issues ranging from lacking access to investment capital to resorting to having trusted men accompany them to cannabis events as a means of safeguarding themselves from harassment. Oh, and it’s not like those objectifying ads completely disappeared, either.
But despite these barriers, the industry has the potential to be a great equalizer, with women occupying more than a third of senior-level positions in 2019, according to a Marijuana Business Daily survey. Additionally, cannabis itself can break traditional, restrictive conceptions of gender.
While cannabis can often further solidify binary definitions of gender, especially when it comes to men in predominantly male spaces, it can also oppositely cultivate a safe environment. Masculinity coded within cannabis use, while prone to toxicity as I mentioned earlier, can also assume an ideology of gender equity, whereby men feel like they can discuss their emotions openly with other men.
For women, cannabis can serve as a reclamation of their bodies, whereby consuming cannabis is no longer stigmatized as nonfeminine or stemming from trauma, but signifies a pleasurable, independent act. 
However, as constructions of gender continue to evolve in society, and thereby in cannabis spaces, we must remain wary of the way cultural and class barriers will continue to act as gatekeepers for marginalized women. 
Stereotypical portrayals of women as healers based on supposed biological differences severely undercut the types of companies, products and images women cannabis entrepreneurs can project. Additionally, as cannabis companies continue their attempts to legitimize themselves, we must oppose the roles whitewashing and heteronormative feminity play in this sanitization, staying vigilant against the industry’s efforts to pride itself on the sanctification of white womanhood as the standard of purity and noncriminality. 
“To be the Martha Stewart of weed is to be the charming woman in an apron, baking homemade goods with cannabis butter for her family,” writes Jacqueline Kittel in her article on women in weed published in The Arbutus Review in 2018. “To be the Martha Stewart of weed is to invoke the power of normative white femininity in order to bring cannabis into Canadian homes as a non-threatening leafy green vegetable just like spinach or broccoli.”
The industry has tried — at times not so enthusiastically — to rid itself of its frat boy image and the hegemonic male culture it has propagated. Undoubtedly, it will continue grappling with its systemic inequities, but it can’t do much to combat the unsafe environment it has willfully created for women, especially women of color, queer women, low-income women and women with disabilities. 
OK, so do Milli’s lyrics actually point to any of this analysis? Probably not. But this is also the same singer who, in response to an interviewer asking her if men seem to irritate her easily, said “Yes, they do. It’s their pure existence. Sometimes they just don’t know things and don’t understand — that’s annoying. It’s a whole bunch of things. I could write a book on it, to be honest.”

Yes, the rumors are true: HBO Max is free for all USC students. Even though HBO Go has been discontinued, that does not mean your days of watching quality television and movies are now over. In fact, they are better than ever. 
HBO is TV with no rules, and HBO Max offers titles outside HBO’s usual catalog. “Friends” is back filling the hole Netflix left when it removed the title in January. In addition to “Friends,” HBO Max also has the 2011 hit show “Pretty Little Liars.” You can watch all of HBO’s best shows, including “Barry,” “Sex and the City” and “Game of Thrones” with your new subscription. 
There’s an endless array of entertainment at your fingertips, and this, understandably, can become overwhelming. To help you out, here are some notable selections you can start streaming now on HBO Max. 
“A Star is Born”
“I just wanted to take another look at you” is what Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) tells Ally (Lady Gaga) in “A Star is Born,” and it’s what you should tell this movie before scrolling past it on HBO Max. “A Star is Born” follows Ally, an up-and-coming pop star, on her journey to fame. Audiences see her grow as an artist, wrestle with rifts in her relationships and find her footing in the music industry. Be sure to watch “A Star is Born” soon — this title will be leaving HBO Max Sept. 7. 
“Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey”
“Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey” is a movie that centers women at its forefront. Screenwriter Christina Hodson and director Cathy Yan bring charisma and energy to this movie, stealing the spotlight from men and giving it all to the women. Audiences will find themselves entertained from beginning to end by comical quips, the occasional explosion, hyenas and vibrant colors — all of which are quintessential components to any movie featuring the eccentric anti-hero Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). 
“Curb Your Enthusiasm”
This improvised show will never fail to make you laugh by poking fun at the seemingly mundane life of Larry David. Comedy students rate Curb as “Best comedy on television right now!” The rhythm of “Curb” is truly sensational comedy. Guest stars of the show range from Ted Danson to Mel Brooks. Join David, who plays a heightened version of himself, in his everyday predicaments that lead to more and more chaos. 
“Euphoria”
“Euphoria” is a Twitter-proclaimed “cultural reset” and rightfully so. The makeup and fashion have become societal staples as the show has become a rightful household name. Dealing with the very real issue of teenage addiction, the show is not for the faint of heart. However, the message is deep and meaningful. Zendaya and the rest of the cast create a touching and beautifully messy world where they struggle to understand the present, past and future. 
“The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”
Who isn’t nostalgic for the ’90s? No more need to stay up late to catch the good-natured sitcom on Nick at Nite. Sing along to the iconic theme song while cooking dinner or spending time with your quarantine circle. “The Fresh Prince” will remind you of Will Smith in his prime before his most recent stint as a YouTuber. Laugh along with Will and dance along with Carlton — “The Fresh Prince” is a great show for beers and buds. 
“Game of Thrones”
If you haven’t seen “Game of Thrones,” what are you doing! “GOT” is a binge-worthy fantasy drama with lovable characters — although maybe just skip the last season. The show garnered worldwide popularity in its heyday, but the plot and emotional connection to the characters remains timeless. “GOT” is full of tight twists and turns that are guaranteed to keep you on your toes. Plus, there are many references to it in mainstream media, so now you can be in on all the jokes!
“Get On Up”
The late Chadwick Boseman delivered a sensational performance as the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, in “Get On Up.” “Get On Up” is a biographical, musical drama that tells Brown’s incredible life story as he evolved into a pioneer for the music industry, especially for soul. The movie touches on multiple parts of Brown’s life, giving the audience further insight into the mind of a man who left an astounding legacy behind. The movie doesn’t use a typical chronological storyline but uses asynchronous editing to keep movie viewers engaged, resulting in a magnetic and electrifying experience and one definitely well worth your time. 
“Grease”
Shooby back into the 1950s with this classic movie musical. While the message of the movie may be flawed and problematic, the music is still great for a sing-along movie night. Newcomer Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) and previously popular all-star athlete Danny (John Travolta) navigate the trials and tribulations of love in high school. As long as you’re aware a woman should never modify her look for “true love,” the movie will be highly enjoyable. Young John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John and the rest of the cast are supremely talented singers and dancers guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. 
“Insecure”
Feel all the feels in Issa Rae’s “Insecure.” Join the protagonists Molly (Yvonne Orji) and Issa (Issa Rae) on their journey to find themselves in the last years of their 20s. While most sitcoms based on the lives of their creators focus on self deprecating humor Rae’s writing is positive, delightful and insightful. Additionally, the soundtrack is full of great jams. The show portrays the relationship between two Black women and South Central in a genuine, personal way. 
“Jojo Rabbit”
Taika Waititi’s anti-hate satire “Jojo Rabbit” is the ultimate heart-melting film. Travel back to World War II and meet a young Nazi enthusiast and his imaginary best friend Hitler. Starring everyone’s favorite “Asian American” actress Scarlet Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Alfie Allen and Waititi himself. It’s an important watch to understand the hand all adults have in shaping the next generation. “Jojo Rabbit” combines gut-wrenching drama with humor.
“Queen & Slim”
Although speculation arose that this movie would be the Black equivalent of the Bonnie and Clyde tale, “Queen & Slim” is way more nuanced than that. It delivers insight on the systems of oppression in the United States that marginalize Black folk and uplift white people. In particular, it criticizes the U.S. justice system and the question of who is innocent or guilty based on the color of a person’s skin. “Queen & Slim,” screenplay written by Lena Waithe and directed by Melina Matsoukas, is a gripping, engaging movie worthy of all praise. 
“Spirited Away”
HBO Max features a collection of 21 Studio Ghibli movies, all of which stand alone as quality, animated masterpieces. But in case you only have two hours and five minutes to spare, “Spirited Away” is the awe-inspiring fairytale you need to watch. Writer-director Hayao Miyazaki builds a charming world that explores supernaturalism, greed, Western consumerism and Japanese culture. “Spirited Away,” the Best Animated Feature winner at the 75th Academy Awards, is a movie worthy of being on your watchlist. 
The “Lord of the Rings” Trilogy 
If you’re a devoted “Game of Thrones” fan who seeks to find solace from the show’s finale, “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy is meant just for you. Immerse yourself in this high-fantasy, enchanting world filled with hobbits, elves, wizards and tons of adventure. And unlike other shows that have unfulfilling, rushed endings, this trilogy won’t disappoint. “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” the trilogy’s final installment, won all 11 Academy Awards it was nominated for. 
“Veep”
“Veep” makes all the horror and awfulness of politics hilarious. “Veep” follows Vice President (VP or VEEP) Selina Meyer as she makes her way into the White House. VP Meyer, who is portrayed by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and her staff are best known for their brutal, vulgar and deeply descriptive insults. Despite being a female protagonist Meyer is an unlovable and very difficult anti-hero to stomach. A great binge if you need to laugh but sometimes it does hit a bit close to home when reflecting on politicians’ corruption.

At the beginning of the school year in Fall 2019, most people would probably say I was doing really well. I had a great internship in the industry I wanted to work in. I held a leadership position at the Daily Trojan, and I even had started writing the “On My Mind” column. I had gotten fairly good grades in all my classes up to that point and fall semester was looking like it would go the same way. 
On the inside, though, I was at my worst. I had so little motivation that it took hours for me to get out of bed, and I barely made it to my classes. I spent all my energy keeping up the façade of a happy, well-adjusted Karan for everyone else to see, so there was none left by the time I got home. I was so miserable that the constant barrage of thoughts in my head that told me I was a failure, that I was a burden and that I was worthless felt more true with each passing moment. 
I had felt depressed before, but never like this. At the same time, identifying the culprit wasn’t hard — to put it simply, I was lonely. I was living alone for the first time, something I should’ve known was a bad idea, given my history of mental illness. My depression made me push away the people closest to me — I fought with my best friend and kept my mom in the dark about how I was feeling. 
My loneliness was so powerful that I found myself checking into a psychiatric hospital and ended up taking a full-year leave of absence from USC to work on my mental health. But I’m back now! I learned so much about myself, mental health and what wellness really looks like. I’m excited to share all of that with you in this column throughout the semester. 
Now, I have a strong social support system and a team of mental health professionals I can turn to in times of crisis. That being said, the loneliness hasn’t gone away — it’s probably gotten worse. I haven’t seen most of my friends in person for almost a full year now, both because of my leave of absence in 2019 and because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
I’m not the only one experiencing loneliness. Even before the pandemic hit, a January report from health insurance provider Cigna said that over 60% of Americans feel some degree of loneliness. Looking at young adults between the ages of 18 to 22 specifically, that number goes up to 79%. It might seem like loneliness isn’t a big deal, but it’s an epidemic that rivals the effects of the coronavirus.   
According to a meta-analysis conducted by researchers at Brigham Young University, the health risks of loneliness are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Loneliness is linked to a wide array of chronic health issues, from expected problems like depression and anxiety to more serious conditions, including dementia and heart problems. 
Loneliness during this pandemic is particularly harmful to college students. College is an inherently social experience. Classes are just one part of a broad university culture that’s defined by a thriving social life: Attending parties, joining clubs and student organizations and making friends that’ll stay with you for life are all integral to student life — and we’re missing out. 
It might seem like social media is the answer to the problem of loneliness. It’s an easy way to connect with friends, communicate instantly and see what the world is up to — but research from the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology reveals that social media might actually be one of the things contributing to people’s loneliness. 
The study asked one group of college students to limit their social media use to 10 minutes per platform each day and told the other group to use their social media as usual. The group that used social media less reported significantly lower levels of depression and loneliness. While it looks like an easy way to connect with friends, social media often only makes us feel left out (or, given the current coronavirus mandates, makes us miss people we haven’t seen in months because of the pandemic). 
However, there is hope — being alone or isolated doesn’t necessarily translate to loneliness. Loneliness is a feeling, not a fact. It takes work, but nurturing existing relationships can make you feel as connected to each other as ever. 
Stay in touch with your friends in different ways. It might feel normal to only contact that one friend by text or always FaceTime that other friend on the weekends. This works when online communication happens in conjunction with in-person meetings. When you can’t engage with your peers face-to-face anymore, doing the same thing over and over gets boring. 
But it’s easy to get creative. Send a snail mail letter to a friend, meet up with them over Zoom the next day and text them that afternoon. Find fun ways to keep in touch — I’ve started sending my friends quirky questions, like what kind of restaurant they would open if they could. I end up learning more about my friends while also connecting with them on a personal level. 
Make the most of online Zoom meetings. Pre-pandemic, a party could just be people standing around while music plays and drinks are served. Now, over Zoom, that would probably be boring and ineffective — but there are many creative ways to use Zoom to throw epic hangouts. You can plan a scavenger hunt, giving riddles and clues that lead to household items you know your friends have. You can host a Netflix Party drinking game, rejoicing over a favorite film by taking shots at its most iconic moments. A few weeks ago, I hosted a murder mystery party over Zoom, giving each of my friends a motive to kill the victim and leaving clues about who the murderer could be throughout the game (it was a spectacular experience). 
Loneliness is on the rise, and college students are one of the most at-risk demographics. It’s essential to stay connected with social support systems in creative ways and reach out for help when it’s needed. It’s never wrong to tell someone you’re not doing okay, and there will always be people available to support you. 
Help is available for anyone who needs it. Students dealing with mental health concerns can contact the 24/7 phone line (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance from USC Mental Health Services. If you are concerned about a fellow Trojan, you can notify Trojans Care 4 Trojans by calling (213) 821-4710.

Although no one wished for its return, the California wildfire made a major comeback this August, creating two of the three largest fires in California history, damaging nearly 2,000 structures and causing seven fatalities in Northern California by as of Sept. 2. An unusually massive lightning storm is believed to be the main cause of this tragedy, but the underlying problem of climate change cannot be overlooked.
Unfortunately, people rarely see the connection between wildfires and global warming, primarily because wildfires are often regarded as unpreventable natural disasters. However, an article from National Geographic points out that the frequency, scale and damage of wildfires have increased dramatically since 1980. Another group of statistics provided by Cal Fire indicates that 17 of the 20 largest wildfires in California took place after 2000. Flammable materials such as trees and grasses, dry air and extreme heat are believed to be the triggers of these wildfires. 
In the meantime, California has been suffering a long-term drought for almost two decades, and this summer is on track to be its hottest in history. These factors undoubtedly increased the spread of the recent fire, which ravaged more than 520,000 hectares of land by Aug. 27. For comparison, the wildfires burned about 105,147 hectares in all of 2019, which is about the size of 71,529 football fields.
There is no reason to conclude that the scale and intensity of these wildfires increased by accident — at least, not logically. Similar trends connected to climate change have taken place in other parts of the world. In 2019, Australia experienced its most intense bushfire seasons, which lasted for more than half a year and raised significant environmental concerns worldwide. Last winter, Venice, which has experienced high tides with increasing frequency in the past several years, also reported having its second-highest water level in history. The ongoing wildfires in California stress the importance of taking action against global warming and preventing the existential threats and financial damages it brings to all humans. 
Individuals can try to make a difference by taking a variety of measures, such as participating in carpools, purchasing energy-efficient appliances and not using disposable food containers. People can also participate in community clean-ups and water preservation, which will help lower carbon emissions and protect the soil. In the meantime, students can also increase their advocacy for environmental protection by participating in environmental science lectures and joining environmental clubs. In order to help those who have been suffering from this year’s wildfire, individuals should consider donating to local food banks that support affected families. Other organizations, such as the American Red Cross and the California Fire Foundation, also accept donations to provide relief.
Aside from individual, small-scale efforts, the government must also implement better strategies to combat climate change. President Donald Trump led the United States to drop out of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, saying the decision would alleviate the economic burden cutting emissions would have on United States businesses and workers. However, that does not mean that the process of establishing an environmentally friendly society should come to an end. The government should make careful decisions regarding national environmental regulations.
The current administration plans to roll back around 100 environmentally conscious policies and has already revoked California’s authority to set stricter tailpipe emission standards. The government has also weakened the limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles this March. These measures contributed to the largest decline in carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, and rolling them back will not only increase fossil fuel production but also seriously challenge the United States’ former pro-environmental protection stance in the world. 
Supporters of the rollbacks may argue that environmental regulations hinder economic developments, but economic growth will ultimately lose its necessity when the state of the environment inevitably becomes too volatile and chaotic to ignore. Instead of relying heavily on fossil fuels, the government should divest from fossil fuel and consider investing in clean or renewable energy, boosting energy efficiency and making public transportation more convenient. The U.S. can also strengthen its cooperation with the United Nations Environment Assembly to work on national and global environmental management, evaluate current conditions and educate people to help protect the environment.
The future of the environment is linked to the future of humanity. The damage that climate change has wrought over the years can no longer be ignored. Especially in light of the California wildfires, it is imperative to start listening to the environment when it is showing the negative effects of climate change and work to prevent the next tragedy from occurring.

When I hear the word “baseball,” particularly MLB, all five senses are activated in my memory. What could be more endearing than the smell of sausages and beer mixed with a cacophony of screaming adults? Although I cherish my memories of baseball, that’s all it is to me now: just memories. 
Baseball, traditionally known as “America’s pastime,” has struggled in recent years to find the energy it once created in the country. This year threw MLB a curveball, and the league now sits in between a rock and a hard place, asking itself: What are franchises yearning for more energy supposed to do in a pandemic?
Back in March 2016, Bryce Harper, then playing for the Washington Nationals, was criticized for saying, “Baseball’s tired. It’s a tired sport, because you can’t express yourself. You can’t do what people in other sports do.”
The league has made efforts to speed games up to make watching them more appealing, but MLB has still seen declines in both TV ratings and attendance since the early 2000s. The league clearly shows that it has recently shifted its focus to the fan experience, but now in the face of the pandemic, that shift has left no room for consideration about its players and staff. Going into the 2020 season, MLB’s priorities were still stuck on getting fans to the ballpark instead of the safety of players, and now the league must work to correct itself.
In just under three months, the NBA was able to approve a $170 million “bubble” to continue the season that had been shut down in March. MLB had not even started its 2020 season, giving the league ample time to coordinate a strategic effort to hold a season and keep players safe. The bubble has proven to be successful for the NBA, which enters its seventh straight week without a player testing positive for coronavirus. Because of the NBA investing in the safety of its players and the players’ compliance with strict guidelines, the season has resumed without much issue. 
In MLB, however, players are feeling the effects of the league’s lack of precaution and preparation. The league failed to see how important investing in sanitation resources is to continuing a season without a hiccup. Now, because of the attitude of league officials and the shortcomings of MLB’s policies to protect players, ball clubs are frustrated with the consequences of positive cases. Just on the Miami Marlins alone, 17 players have tested positive for the coronavirus this season.  
“If there’s any group that understands the seriousness of what we’re dealing with, it’s our group, because we’ve seen how it’s gone through our clubhouse,” Derek Jeter, Chief Executive Officer of the Marlins, said to The New York Times. “It comes down to discipline. I don’t think there’s any secret formula for a team to be successful through this. You have to be extremely disciplined.”
The discipline in the league should not be on players but on club owners, managers and franchisees — the people making decisions. The players continued their lives like every other American but with more traveling and social interaction. These players were not afforded the option to work from home or in a bubble, so blame should not be placed on them if the coronavirus spreads throughout the league.  
MLB is struggling to grow, especially compared to the NBA. It should have looked to the NBA for a way in which to progress into current times. Instead of being proactive to prevent complications from the pandemic, MLB gives the impression that it was just going to be reactionary once an issue arose.
The same can be said for our country. Individuals should not be blamed for the spread of a virus. Yes, some people continue to be excessively irresponsible. But our country’s decision makers who failed to exhibit leadership when it was needed the most are the real cause of the pandemic’s consequences. When it mattered most, leaders decided that it would be too much to prevent an outbreak, so now we are stuck not knowing what to do next.
Like MLB, the United States had more than adequate time to respond to the threat of the coronavirus and build a plan around it. However, it refused to invest the resources needed and left decisions to be made by individual citizens. Now, individuals are being held responsible for the recklessness of their elected leaders. 
On the other hand, many countries — just like the NBA — invested heavily in safety protocols. Citizens took these precautions seriously and listened to informed advice from national leaders. Unsurprisingly, these investments were effective and countries have begun to recover. 
Now the United States, like MLB, is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Fortunately, MLB may just be losing millions of dollars. The United States, however, has lost nearly 200,000 lives. 
Hopefully, when the time comes, the NFL goes in the direction of the NBA and not MLB — the latter has proven to be the wrong route.
