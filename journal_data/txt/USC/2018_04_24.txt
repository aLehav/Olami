For the past few months, USC students have had issues connecting to USC Wi-Fi networks. Complaints of being unable to submit assignments on time and lagging videos filled halls, classrooms and Facebook chats. Eventually, on March 29, Chief Information Officer Douglas Shook sent every student an email addressing and explaining the recent wireless performance issues. While it is understandable that some issues are out of the University’s control — outside vendors and unforeseen circumstances in weather and hardware both affect the reliability of our Wi-Fi — USC should consider emergency alternatives to provide wireless connection. Institutions of higher education have an obligation to their students to provide a reliable, strong internet connection.

Though Wi-Fi complaints may be brushed off by the older generation as a characteristic of the internet-obsessed, gadget-savvy millennial generation, Wi-Fi is a staple that students cannot function without. According Inside Higher Ed, students come to college with an average of eight or nine wireless devices, compared to the two to three in previous decades. Professors are diverging from printed material in favor of the eco-friendly and ink-saving alternative of online assignments.
USC’s Information Technology Services department is currently working on improving the wireless connection situation, but this process will take a few years before reaching completion. In the meantime, the University has no clear short-term solutions for improvement. The transformational program is called Secure|Connected through which ITS “will rearchitect USC’s network and information security infrastructure to provide faculty, students, researchers and staff with a high-performing network with greater reliability and security protections.” It is anticipated to be complete in 2019, upgrading buildings one at a time, and at times thought to be the least disruptive to occupants.
Aside from eduroam, USC provides two points of connection — “USC Guest Wireless” and “USC Secure Wireless.” However, both run at about the same speed, despite one being only used by USC students and faculty. Guests to the University use the same bandwidth as some of our student population, and though the secure wireless exists to ensure students and staff have network priority, there is not much difference between the two wireless networks.
USC should consider the solution Elon University has adopted — the utilization of one Wi-Fi connection for larger amounts of data streaming, like video games or video streaming. The other can be for milder network usage, such as emailing or document sharing. This ensures that the network is not slowed by less important tasks. The difficulty in this solution is regulating usage — it is unlikely that gamers or viewers will adhere to one network, especially if it is heavily slowed by all the users on the same network.
As ITS works on transforming our wireless connection, there are still instances of network slowdown or blackouts that USC has no short-term solutions for. One would be for students to use the cellular data on their personal devices to upload projects and read materials online. But not everyone has a data plan with this capacity. A more reasonable solution would be for USC to provide a temporary network for when the campus-wide connection is not working. At times, the access points go down in a singular building, and having a backup access point — a hotspot or mobile Wi-Fi — to turn on just for that building would be helpful for students. While USC may not have the infrastructure for an entirely new campus-wide network in cases of emergencies, the University does have capability to provide emergency Wi-Fi access.
Network reconstruction is an expensive project, and for larger universities, the costs can run up into the millions. However, USC’s campus is relatively small — 226 acres of coverage — with most access points located within buildings. This is a project USC can afford and should prioritize. Students are struggling to perform basic tasks necessary to their academic success, and some do not have the mobile data on their cell phone plans to use in place of a stable Wi-Fi connection.
Though USC is working to improve its network connectivity, there are still far too many instances of poor connection. The University is implementing a solution for the long term, but overlooks short-term issues. Students should not have to use up their personal cellular data plans for school-related projects and assignments. At the very least, USC should look to instate a few emergency short-term solutions.

Earlier this month, Maryland passed legislation that, if signed by its governor, would require state education officials to develop health and safety practices for digital device usage in schools. 
For some parents and educators, this bill could help soothe their anxieties about growing digital usage in their children’s daily lives. But it also overestimates the ubiquitous nature of our digital world; if a law ensures a child is limited in their computer hours at school, that doesn’t necessarily mean their habits at home will be monitored. These limitations are a Band-aid solution to growing parental concerns as education has rapidly become steeped in technology. Now, even state-standardized tests are being administered electronically. 
Restrictions on technological use in schools, which imply that these devices are harmful, could also affect children from low-income backgrounds, whose parents aren’t familiar with digital devices and whose technological literacy is almost entirely taught in schools. 
Instead of enforcing hard and fast rules on usage, schools and state officials should work to improve educational curricula so they aren’t as rooted in technology, and encourage moderation in digital use. 
Of course, children should still be taught digital literacy, the basics of surfing the web to find accurate information, the harmful effects of cyberbullying and many more prevalent digital topics. But imposing time restraints on digital usage only serves to create a negative connotation surrounding these tools, which, if used correctly, could actually enrich children’s educational experiences. 
Extreme digital use could have a harmful effect on a child’s health, but what many parents and officials fail to realize is that time spent online isn’t necessarily counterproductive or non-educational. Khan Academy, TED Talks and Crash Course are a handful of thousands of platforms that serve as knowledgeable resources for school-aged children and students in general. Tumblr and Reddit are also public forums that initiate thought-provoking discussions on a variety of topics that are beneficial not only to children, but also to adults.
Another aspect to consider in monitoring young people’s digital behavior is adults’ behaviors. If adults spend most of their free time with their necks craned over an iPhone, this behavior becomes normalized for children to mimc. 
I grew up with two immigrant parents who only recently purchased smartphones last year, but it was out of sheer curiosity that I became the most technologically literate member of our household. And for many children, curiosity is what drives them to go online, especially if they see many adults exhibiting similar behaviors.
Maryland’s upcoming legislation, and the debate over if and how schools should regulate children’s computer time, is only going to create a new set of rules children will want to break. There has been a recent push to teach kids programming skills, and technological literacy is touted as a necessary skill in the 21st century. As understanding digital tools becomes increasingly important, even within the classroom, it would be difficult to impose these regulations without overstepping boundaries in dictating how children should behave — at school and at home.

For so many years, music festivals have been the cornerstone of American youth culture. The famed festivals in U.S. history: Woodstock ’69, Monterey Pop Festival, Newport Folk Festival, all have been considered symbols of pure, unadulterated escapism.
As it stands today, there are dozens of major music festivals that run annually across the country, each with their own unique memories, associations and themes. 
Festivals like Michigan’s Electric Forest, South Florida’s Okeechobee, New Orleans’ Voodoo or New York’s Governor’s Ball illustrate the inexplicable satisfaction of sharing a musical celebration with thousands of close strangers.
Naturally, it is the dream of many to attend, by today’s standards, the true Mecca of them all: Indio’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. And, truthfully, for fans of music festivals, their bubble will be obliterated.
Coachella was the antithesis of just about everything that makes music festivals special. The community, the unspoken camaraderie between the artist and the patrons, the artist’s visible sense of accomplishment playing in front of thousands of people whose lives they’d changed with their music; none of that was present in the desert this past weekend at Weekend 2 of the festival. 
For many attendees, Coachella seemed to hold little value outside of the bragging rights and the opportunity to wear outfits that they could never wear anywhere else. Coachella is a place to be seen; the music comes second.
Thus, one’s sympathy should lie with the 150+ artists who tirelessly prepared for a career-defining Coachella performance, only to find out that they had lost the crowd before their show even started.
To be fair, there were a few, albeit obvious, sets where the crowd properly engaged with the performer. Beyoncé played perhaps the two most anticipated concerts of the year on back-to-back weekends, but BeyHive Twitter quickly attested that the thousands in attendance could have been far more grateful for the chance to witness such a milestone in music. She was, after all, the first woman of color to headline the heralded festival since its inception in 1999. 
Yet, Beyoncé’s larger-than-Coachella presence still led to some unintended consequences for performers earlier in the afternoon. Nile Rodgers, a legend in his own right, took the main stage with Chic more than seven hours before she was scheduled to perform. Still, the disco and funk rock legends couldn’t manage to get the swaths of Beyoncé campers on their feet despite the overwhelming talent they showcased.
BROCKHAMPTON’s Coachella debut was especially transformative, as patrons had been acutely aware of their talents, but they were not prepared for the youthful explosion of personality and professionalism on display. The exact choreography, unique personalities and impeccable chemistry between each member allowed everyone in the crowd to understand how special this group could be.
Never before had many in the crowd been so naturally drawn to a group of people their age. They understood how millennials felt, and they expressed it through their music better than most artists their age — or those far beyond their years — ever could. The wide emotive range of aggression, swagger and grace within their music exemplifies their refusal to be pigeon-holed. However, BROCKHAMPTON sensed that the sheen quickly wore on the jaded crowd five songs into the set, and their composed professionalism turned to inspired rage as they went feral on their most aggressive tracks like “HEAT,” “STAR” and “QUEER.”
Additionally, hip-hop artists Vince Staples and Flatbush Zombies delivered high-energy, jaw-dropping performances in front of crowds where the vast majority of attendees refused to match the moxie of the performers. Both artists were visibly upset, and audibly in the case of Flatbush Zombies, as they left their respective stages.
As far as musical purpose goes, Coachella is devoid of all integrity. It represents the hyper-capitalist approach to escapist hedonism that ruins the essence of the music festival with their primary focus lying in exclusivity. Music festivals are about community, bliss and, most importantly, the live music experience. While Coachella obviously believes that these can be achieved through the principles of supply and demand, a change in culture needs to happen for the festival to return to its former glory.

The Arts District is temporarily abuzz with construction and trucks, but a moment of seclusion amid the chaos can be found in a new cafe, Maru Coffee. The new location, situated on Santa Fe Street, is their second location, with the chain’s first being in Los Feliz.
Photo from Yelp.
The long, cherrywood-topped counter offers up bags of Maru’s own brand of coffee and other beans. Their pastries, baked fresh each morning, include all different kinds of croissants. The plain one is $4, and chocolate or ham and cheese come at an additional cost of $0.50. The chocolate croissant is flaky, and the chocolate, though ample, is not overly sweet. It pairs well with a mocha, as Maru does not overpower its espresso with sweet chocolate, opting instead for a stronger, deeper flavor.
While a cup of joe is already generally quite pricey in Los Angeles, Maru is on the more expensive side of the spectrum. A latte or a cup of cold brew is $4.50 and a mocha or matcha latte is $5.25. This is more expensive than their other location, where a latte is $4.50, a mocha is $5. This is in part because of the cost of operating in downtown Los Angeles; though there are more caffeine-seekers than in suburban areas, the cost of the space is indelibly more expensive. Other coffee shops in the area are on the same price scale — Maru is just a few blocks south from Blue Bottle Coffee, where a latte is $4.75 and a mocha is $5.25. 
Maru brews Ippodo matcha, an authentic and heavily sought after brand of matcha. Their special signature coffees include a spiced cold brew sprinkled with pepper and topped off with a sweet cream. They also serve an espresso tonic, consisting of two shots of espresso poured into a cup of Fever Tree tonic, resulting in a bitter combination that is definitely an acquired taste. Served in a thick ceramic mug, their house drip coffee is a medium full-bodied roast, a strong start to any morning.
The space is white and open, a total revamp of the original warehouse. The side wall is lined with tall windows, filling the room with natural light. The floor maintains its original gridded concrete, but the walls are coated in a glossy eggshell white, which can be a bit too aggressive on the eye in broad daylight. The darker wooden ceiling has two small skylights, and a few spotlight style lamps. Part of the space is enclosed by a windowed wall,  which surrounds a table and a small home office setup, with a printer and an Apple desktop computer. The workspace is unusual in the open space, but not terribly out of place. Maru’s playlist features jazz artists McCoy Tyner and Cannonball Adderley, mixing the sounds of saxophone with the buzz of the espresso machine and whizz of passing cars. 
Along the walls are light wooden benches, with slightly raised partitions that act as short wooden tables. There is also one large communal table in the center of the open space, accompanied by wooden seats. The table is a bit low, and patrons have a tendency to hunch over the table while doing work, which can get uncomfortable when sitting for over an hour. There are a few decorative plants, but they are sparse and long-leaved, so that the greenery provides contrast but does not take over the white and pale wood look. 
Amid the hustle and bustle of the Arts District, Maru is a beautifully minimalist space, perfect for sipping espresso and clearing one’s head. Their coffee and tea are well executed, not watered down or smothered by sugar. Maru Coffee’s Arts District location is open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends.

A few weeks ago, I dreamt that I was a freshman on move-in day at USC. Unfortunately, I don’t remember much else from the dream besides unpacking my things into a room in Birnkrant Residential College, but the combined feeling of anxiousness and excitement was so vivid that it didn’t feel like a dream at all — for a moment it was like I was 18 years old again. When I finally awoke, I couldn’t shake the emotions from the dream. I carried those feelings of nervous elation for a few days, until I forgot all about it. That is, until now.
I don’t think it was a coincidence that I had this dream. For weeks now, I’ve been dreading this very moment — saying goodbye to “From The Top.” I have a hard time letting things go, and I also hate change. I’m set in my routine and I try not to stray from it. Ever. But there are times when certain life changes will be out of my control. Seeing as I am not continuing with my graduate degree after this semester, I knew I’d be forced to end my column. And that time is now.
I didn’t think this was going to be a big deal, but I literally haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. In the last week alone, it has been the only thing on my mind. And seeing as I’ve been thinking about this day in such detail, it can’t not be a big deal. So my initial idea to keep this last column distanced and unemotional was scrapped, because it wouldn’t feel right to end things that way. This is my last chance to say what I need to say, so I’m veering from my usual script to end things as cleanly as possible.
When I first pitched this column years ago, the plan was simple: create a classical music column that was tied to my life as a gay student living in Los Angeles. I wrote about La bohème, I puritani and Lucia di Lammermoor and how they compared to my emotional state or love life. Over the years, things began to stray, and its structure became less rigid and more of a public diary. I began writing on topics both candid and vague. Some were personal, such as the lucid retellings of disastrous dates. Others were detached from myself, like the time and Beyoncé released LEMONADE and I just had to say something about it. I met my boyfriend Matt during the early days of this column, so the primary accounts of my loneliness soon blossomed into sonnets of true love. I didn’t expect to become so attached to “From The Top,” but it was the only constant in my life for a long time. I looked forward to seeing it in print on Tuesdays. It eventually became a lifeline of mine, perhaps to a degree some would deem unhealthy. I just never wanted it to end.
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
When I “graduated” in 2016, I bid farewell to what I thought would be the end of my career at the Daily Trojan. I took some time away from school to work, but would eventually return a year later to finally finish my degree. Thus began “From The Top: 2.0,” because I felt like I left things unfinished the first time around. When I completed my undergraduate degree later that semester, I thought it was finally over (again), and I would need to say goodbye (again). Until, that is, I got into USC for graduate school. I had yet another chance to finally say what I needed to say, because again, I felt like I had more in me. But with this third time being the charm, I realize that there will always be something more to say. There’s always going to be that feeling of regret — feeling like I wasn’t honest in my writing, or wishing I had talked about a certain topic or concern. In some ways, I feel like the only reason I chose USC for grad school was to continue “From The Top.” But now I’m just starting to feel like Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed. Frankly, at 26 years old, I’m far too old to keep this going.
As much as I hate letting things go, it’s time to move on.
Before I submitted this final column, I took a long walk around campus. I wanted to get a good look at things before saying goodbye. But as soon as this hits the printers, it’s all over. And I’m OK with that. Have I said all I needed to say? Absolutely not. I don’t think I ever will. But to quote the great BoJack Horseman, “Closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets. It, like true love and the Munich Olympics, doesn’t exist in the real world. The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.”
I’m never going to feel satisfied with how I leave this column. But I need to be OK with moving forward. And move forward I will. So thanks for the laughs, and thanks for the cries. It’s been a pleasure.
But maybe I’ll be back some day. Who knows?

In collaboration with the United Way of Greater Los Angeles Home for Good Initiative, the USC Price Center for Social Innovation has established the Homelessness Policy Research Institute. 
The Homelessness Policy Research Institute focuses on research to inform policy and program design. Photo from USC News.
According to a press release, the institute funded by a leadership gift from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation and with support from the Home for Good Funders Collaborative brings together over 30 local and national experts from research institutions to conduct research to address homelessness in Los Angeles County.
“The urgent need to reduce the number of individuals experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County requires a new model of collaboration between researchers and policymakers,” HPRI director Gary Painter said in the news release. “The institute harnesses the collective talent of the region’s top scholars from a range of disciplines, including housing and real estate, economics, behavioral and primary health care … to conduct timely, actionable research that directly informs policymaking at all levels of government.”
Committed to collaboration across universities, HPRI operates with the USC Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness and builds upon the United Way’s aim to end homelessness in Los Angeles County through four main goals. 
According to the press release, the institute will strive to foster collaboration and coordination among the researchers. They will also provide current and upcoming research to policymakers and community partners to increase transparency when presenting “on-the-ground work.” Additionally, HPRI plans to inform policy and program design through research and assist the development and coordination of proposal requests.
“This collaboration between policymakers and the research community will ensure that policies and programs aimed at ending homelessness benefit from leveraging Los Angeles’ research resources,” said Bill Pitkin, director of domestic programs at the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. “In order to make effective policy and program decisions that positively impact our homeless neighbors, we must ensure that they are informed by research on what works in ending homelessness.”
Through research, experts at HPRI plan to inform funding allocations that directly affect the homeless population. According to the release, these include Measures H and HHH, which provide tax support for new housing developments and an increase in services offered to the homeless. Additionally, the institute is in communication with local and regional homelessness agencies. 
“While 58,000 people experience homelessness on any given night in Los Angeles County, there are another 700,000 severely rent-burdened households whose housing instability puts them at great risk of homelessness,” said Peter Lynn, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority executive director. “Our partnership with HPRI will allow us to better serve people facing housing crises by evaluating the effectiveness of the programs we have to serve them.”

NBC News political director Chuck Todd sat down with The Week’s editor-at-large Marc Ambinder on Monday for a conversation at Wallis Annenberg Hall. At the panel, the pair focused on politics, the impact President Donald Trump has had on the nation and the future of journalism.

The conversation began with Todd’s thoughts on contemporary politics. He cited globalization as a defining characteristic of the current “historical era” and expressed concern over the influence of social media on the political climate.
“The thing we don’t appreciate enough is how much social media has changed human behavior,” Todd said. “We have to create some cultural guardrails on social media. I think it’s self-governance and I don’t think it’s something you can expect to come from government.”
Todd also answered questions about the upcoming midterm elections in November. He said he doubts Republicans will be able to rely on last December’s tax cuts.
“I’ve never felt so uncertain about fall this late in a midterm cycle,” Todd said. “We don’t know how things will play out. About half of the Democratic candidates think it’s ‘run against Trump,’ while the other half think they have to ignore him and stick to the issues.” 
During the event, Todd also discussed the effects Twitter has had on media consumption. He said that if readers only follow Twitter headlines, they will only get the “stereotypes of each party, the stereotypes of every position and the stereotypes of every debate” while losing the critical nuance stories have to offer.
“The thing that has changed the most is speed and interest,” Todd said. “Here is the challenge for journalism over all. We live in a time where all we want is something that saves us time. Unfortunately, that has not worked well for following political news.”
At the event, Todd described his upbringing in a bipartisan household where his father ensured he had a “wide aperture for politics.” Todd went on to emphasize his belief in nonpartisan news coverage and underscore his respect for the institution of the presidency.
“There is no such thing as a purist neutrality, but I still demand that,” Todd said. “If I hear my kids making fun of the president because it’s become an easy thing to do in elementary schools and middle schools, I tell them I don’t want to hear that — you don’t denigrate that.”
Todd and Ambinder also addressed the series of recent tweets from Trump referring to Todd as “sleepy eyes Chuck Todd.” 
“I’ve asked Trump where he came up with the nickname and he said, ‘I don’t remember but once I have a nickname, I stick to it,’” Todd said.
Many have questioned whether or not Trump’s insult is anti-Semitic. 
“I have a theory,” Todd said in reference to Trump’s time hosting The Apprentice. “It’s pretty simple: He watches a lot of NBC because it’s his home network. I think I said something that made him upset so he hit pause on his DVR. You ever hit pause and you catch someone’s eyes and you’re like, ‘Wow, that’s funny?’ I always say to myself, think like him — think like Trump. Do we really think he researched some 1933 secret anti-Semitic society, or, did he just hit the pause button on his DVR?”
Ambinder, an adjunct professor at Annenberg, said that by engaging with guests like Todd at events like these, students can develop deeper insights into the effects of social media essential for budding journalists. 
“Chuck would literally read hundreds of political articles a day to figure out what was most important for his audience,” Ambinder said. “There’s a deep well of knowledge behind what he does and preparation is essential. Also, social media’s effects can be really toxic or really helpful. As Chuck said, we collectively have to think of some guardrails for it.”

Over 1,000 students gathered at Bovard Auditorium Monday night for the annual USC TAMID Tank, which allowed several students to pitch to a venture capitalist panel for potential investment.

TAMID Tank, modeled after the ABC television show Shark Tank, featured three student startup groups. With more than 35 applicants, the organizers of the event selected only three groups via student body voting online.
According to Daniel Newman, who founded the event at USC last year after seeing its success at Queens College, the organization was created to empower students by giving undergraduates an opportunity to showcase their ideas on stage with venture capitalists.
“What I realized is that a lot of people at USC had a bunch of ideas, but none of them actually acted on [them],” Newman said. “I realized sometimes when I spoke to them, the reason they thought was they were too young and too inexperienced to actually go out and pitch their idea to raise money.”
The three student founders who led the group pitches were Sarah Allen, a senior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation; Molly McClary, a junior majoring in public relations; and Jack Agarwal, a senior in the World Bachelor in Business program.
IN/LINE, a startup founded by Allen and Ben Choe, a senior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, is a fashion showroom solution that provides efficiency for wholesale buying appointments. According to Allen, this software development solution is aimed at making the wholesale buying and fashion industry more efficient and fast paced for niche retail clients.
“Wholesales has not been touched [by software solutions],” Choe said. “We realize that IN/LINE has the potential to revolutionize wholesale business. Not only make the jobs easier for sales reps, but allowing brand to generate more revenue while developing stronger relationships with their clients.”
ABLEapp, founded by McClary, is a customer review-driven platform that connects parents of individuals with intellectual disabilities to services for a lifetime. The app was created to aid families with mentally disabled children through digitally connecting parents with each other, therapists and medical providers. 
“We create ABLEapp as a way to alleviate some of the apprehensions that parents face day-to-day,” McClary said. “We are a platform that connects parents to better resources and services for each and every stage of their child’s life.”
Itinero, co-founded by Agarwal, is a consumer tool delivering itineraries that fit consumer preferences and schedules. The app considers traffic time, weather, scheduling and entertainment factors to deliver a more efficient itinerary planning experience for users. 
“Itinero guides you through your free time by creating a road map of activities and great restaurant recommendations based on your budget, you time frame and your personality, like maybe adventurous or laid back or romantic,” Agarwal said. “Itinero is the quickest way where you can go from not knowing what to do to doing fun things in Los Angeles, never having to waste another second planning.”
The event also featured investors on the Venture Capitalists panel as keynote speakers of the night. Speakers included Tinder co-founder Jonathan Badeen, Applied Semantics co-founder Eytan Elbaz, former Nickelodeon actress Jesse Draper, Luma Launch venture lead Laurent Grill and PLG Ventures partner Elaine Russell.
Elbaz shared his experience building a successful startup business. 
“You are not really going to know whether or not [your startup] will be received well,” Elbaz said. “One of these products might be a great product … but you should think about the size of the company you want to have, the aspirations you have. [You should] be honest and realistic about how big the idea is that you are focusing on.”
According to Badeen, TAMID Tank makes an effort to invite a panel of experienced and successful investors. The organizers want to provide audiences and competitors with valuable feedback regarding their innovations and how to execute them into reality. 
“As an entrepreneur, you are creating tools for everybody,” Badeen said. “So the more that you understand everybody and markets the better you are. Don’t be afraid of going off an uneven path and learning something.”
TAMID Tank introduced a new segment, “Life after TAMID Tank,” to the event. According to  TAMID Tank chair Deepthi Sampathkumar, the segment was implemented to reflect upon the lasting impact TAMID Tank has had in supporting last year’s winner Kevin Kassel in his startup career. 
“I wanted to make sure that it has an impact on these students,” Sampathkumar said. “They come, they pitch, they get an investment. And it is really important to get to see how that investment helped them.”
Another mission of TAMID Tank is to forge a connection between the Israeli economy and American entrepreneurship. 
“[Israel] has a solution-oriented mindset that has to deal with things in a very specific, short amount of time,” said Elbaz, an Israeli American entrepreneur. “So when you think of responding to the threat of annihilation, needing to innovate, getting a product out quickly, the same things that help you essentially defend the nation are the exact same skills that you need to build a startup. So that is what Israel has done.”
The competing companies were judged by two factors: the audience attendance and the opinions of the panel of venture capitalists. After tallying the votes from both peers and investors, ABLEapp came in third place, Itinero second and IN/LINE took the grand prize of $1,000 to develop their startup.

The USC baseball team convenes before the first pitch. They are looking to right the ship during the final stretch of the season. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The UCLA Bruins swept the USC Trojans in this weekend’s three-game series. The Bruins improved their record to 25-10 on the season while the Trojans now sit at .500 with a record of 18-18 on the year.
Game one saw USC freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt take the mound against UCLA senior pitcher Jake Bird. Experience was key in this matchup as Bird and the Bruins took game one by a resounding scoreline of 16-1.
The game started off poorly for the Trojans as the Bruins scored 5 runs in the first inning. The Bruins would go on to score 2 more runs in the next inning. Hurt then kept the Bruins quiet through his final two innings on the day as he went on to pitch four innings in total. Hurt faced 23 batters on Friday’s game, and allowed seven earned runs on eight hits, but managed to strike out five batters. Comparatively, Bird went for seven innings and faced 28 batters on the day; however, he only allowed one earned run on eight hits with just one strikeout on the day.
The rest of game one wasn’t pretty for the Trojans either as freshman pitchers Riley Lamb and Augie Sylk collectively gave up 9 runs to the Bruins in five innings. While the Trojans weren’t lacking in hitting, having recorded eight hits on the day, their defense and pitching ultimately failed them as they were unable to capitalize and score any runs.
Game two Saturday didn’t fare any better for the Trojans as the Bruins obliterated them 19-2 at Jackie Robinson Stadium. Junior pitcher Solomon Bates took the mound for the Trojans against the Bruins’ star freshman pitcher Zach Pettway. Pettway has been impressive all season, posting a 6-1 record on the year after Saturday’s game. He aims to be a potential star pitcher in the Pac-12 for years to come. After Saturday’s game, Bates now has a 3-2 record on the year.
The Bruins got off to an early lead, putting up 2 runs in the first inning. However, the Trojans fought back in the second and brought the scoreline to 2-1. The highlight of the game for the Trojans occured in the second inning as freshman shortstop Ben Ramirez hit a solo homerun, his second this season.
However, the Bruins got hot in the next three innings, scoring 3 in the third, 1 in the fourth and 6 in the fifth to put the scoreline out of reach at 12-2 in favor of the Bruins after five innings.
The Trojans showed a little more grit in game three, but were unable to stop the Bruins from scoring in the end. Junior pitcher Quentin Longrie took the mound for the Trojans on Sunday, and showed real composure throughout the game. Through the first six innings, he only allowed the Bruins to score 3 runs, an impressive feat considering the Bruins’ quality of batting order and previous results.
The Bruins got off to an early lead scoring 1 run in each of the second, fourth and sixth innings to take the scoreline to 3-0 through six. However, in the seventh inning, the Trojan bats came alive as junior left fielder Lars Nootbaar hit another 2-run homerun, taking his tally to 5 on the year. That brought the scoreline to 3-2 through the top half of the seventh. But the Bruins fought back and put up 4 runs of their own in the bottom half of the seventh, halting all of the Trojans’ momentum. USC was able to put up 1 more run late in the ninth to bring the final tally to 7-3 in favor of the Bruins.
After the UCSB game Tuesday, head coach Dan Hubbs urged his team to limit mistakes on the defensive side. 
“If we don’t make those mistakes we can limit the damage,” he said. “When you’re not playing great can you limit innings to 1 or 2 [runs] instead of 3 or 4?”
Yet, this weekend’s series showed the opposite from the Trojans. They were unable to limit the scoring damage in several innings, rendering each game out of reach. The Bruins are one of the best baseball teams in the country, and they proved that this weekend. Ultimately, the Trojans did not do enough to limit their innings and fight back.
The Trojans will look to end their current three-game losing streak in their next game against Long Beach State Tuesday night at Dedeaux Field. The Trojans will follow up that game with a weekend series against Pac-12 rivals Oregon in Eugene. 
Oregon is 19-18 on the season and 6-12 in the Pac-12.

The Trojans headed into last weekend’s Beach Invitational and Mt. SAC Relays with high expectations and did not disappoint, putting up impressive performances in both meets. The team combined for six first-place finishes, breaking school records along the way. The team heads into its last meet of the regular season next Sunday at UCLA with the No. 9-ranked men’s team and the No. 2-ranked women’s team in the nation.

The Trojans’ performance at the Mt. SAC Relays was headlined by the women’s 4x100m relay team’s victory with a school record-setting time of 42.57. Redshirt sophomore Angie Annelus, seniors Kendall Ellis and Deanna Hill and freshman TeeTee Terry ran blistering times against elite competition, including a USA team featuring former Trojan and Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix.
Terry went on to break another school record individually, as she blazed a time of 10.99 in the women’s 100m dash invitational. Remarkably, she beat out 2016 Olympic silver medalist Tori Bowie, who finished second with a time of 11.04. Terry’s time is the best in the country this season. Annelus also secured a victory in the women’s 100m open dash the day before, with a time of 11.44.
Unsurprisingly, sophomore Michael Norman won the men’s 400m race once again, running a time of 44.53. Junior Rai Benjamin gave the Trojans a second-place finish in the event as well, on a time of 44.74. Freshman Cameron Samuel won the men’s 400m hurdles, setting a PR of 50.95. His performance put him into the top-15 times of the season nationally.
Sophomore Anna Cockrell finished third in the women’s 400m hurdles, with a season-best time of 56.66. Senior Kendall Ellis placed third in the women’s 400m invitational, running a 51.43. Redshirt senior Nick Ponzio placed second in the men’s shot put invitational, with a best distance of 62-1.75. Redshirt senior Breana Jemison rounded out the meet for the Trojans with a second-place finish in the women’s shot put invitational, with a best throw of 54-11.25.
The Trojans made their presence felt at the Beach Invitational held in Long Beach last weekend as well. Sophomore Courtney Corrin won the women’s long jump, with a best leap of 21-2.25, which is a season best. Senior Madisen Richards came in second behind her, with a PR of 20-8.00. Redshirt senior Eric Sloan took third in the men’s triple jump with a best of 51-9.75, the best among collegians at the meet. Redshirt sophomore Nathan Bultman placed ninth in the men’s hammer throw with a best mark of 208-2, which was also the best among collegians. 
This weekend, the Trojans head into their last meet of the regular season with the Dual Meet against UCLA, an annual tradition. This year’s iteration of the event will be held at UCLA’s Drake Stadium. School pride will be on the line as the two bitter rivals battle for dominance once again in direct competition. The Trojan women won last year’s meet, while the men fell to the Bruins. Both teams will look to bring home victories and bragging rights on Sunday.

USC senior Jo Kremer was announced as the 2018 Pac-12 Beach Volleyball Scholar-Athlete of the Year on Monday. The award is given annually to an athlete who excels both in the classroom and in their respective sport. Kremer is the second-consecutive Trojan to win the award for beach volleyball, after Nicolette Martin received the honor last season.

Kremer, who is originally from Pacific Palisades, Calif., is currently finishing her degree as a communication major and holds a 3.72 GPA. After transferring from Notre Dame’s indoor volleyball team in 2014, Kremer has been one of the key factors to the Trojans’ recent dominance in collegiate beach volleyball. Last week on Senior Day, heach coach Anna Collier spoke about Kremer’s contributions during her time as a Trojan. 
“Jo helped carry us to three national championships,” Collier said. “She was part of the foundation of what we’ve had for the past few years.” 
Before winning the Scholar-Athlete of the Year award this season, Kremer was named on the conference’s all-academic second team in 2016 and 2017. On the sand this season, Kremer has a 23-8 record individually and boasts a 19-7 record when paired up with fellow senior Jenna Belton, good for third-most on the team. Kremer will look to help carry USC once again on their quest to repeat as both Pac-12 and NCAA champions.
According to the Pac-12 Conference, the Scholar-Athlete of the Year must be a senior in terms of athletics and be on track to receive a degree. They also must have maintained a GPA of 3.0 or higher, partaken in at least half of the contests in their respective sports and spent at least one year living at their school. 
Every Pac-12 school is allowed to nominate one individual per sport, and the winners are then chosen by a committee of conference staff at the end of each sport’s regular season. The accomplishments of the athletes in their sports are also taken into consideration when choosing a winner.

Julia Poe | Daily Trojan
Most people have a dream of what they want to be when they grow up. When I was little, I wanted to be a wizard, and when that didn’t work out, I settled on being a zoologist. It took until I reached high school to discover that journalism was an OK profession, and I didn’t latch onto sports writing until my sophomore year of college.
But for young athletes, childhood dreams are swiftly becoming expectations before kids enter high school. Just this past February, Alexia Carrasquillo committed to play softball at the University of Florida. She turned 12 the next day.
Maybe this is just a reflection of the growth of athletics in the past decades. After all, the growth of the youth sports world has boomed into an international industry. Players, coaches, trainers and parents alike are investing in sports for their kids at a younger age, which is in turn elevating the level of play that we see at all levels. Maybe this is just another important step in this continual progress as athletes become more competitive and the game continues to improve.
Yet something seems wrong about turning the game into a business at such a young age. I’m sure that a college commitment doesn’t make Carrasquillo, or any other young commit, love the game any less. She might even feel more relaxed as she enters high school, unafraid to take risks without any college scouts to impress. 
But she’s also already chosen her path for the next 10 years of her life. Imagine yourself at 12 years old. Did you know where you wanted to go to college? What you wanted to major in? How you wanted to live the next 10 years of your life?
When I first profiled him a year ago, the thing that struck me the most about Sam Darnold is that he’s only two days older than me. At the time, I was asking him and his parents questions about things like first-round draft picks and NFL starting gigs. It was hard to rectify the clarity and maturity of those conversations with the fact that Darnold was only a few days older than me — a sophomore at the time with absolutely no idea where the heck life would take me.
Now, Darnold is heading into the NFL Draft on Thursday while I’m just focused on passing a few finals. It’s wild to think that kids — because that’s what they are, kids — grow up into these adult expectations so quickly. I don’t think all of this is bad. Along the way, star athletes are often forced to become more dedicated and motivated individuals, and quarterbacks in particular often develop a specialized set of leadership skills.
But when I watch the draft this week, my mind is going to keep shifting back to the younger kids, the ones in middle school like Carrasquillo, who are already dedicating their lives to this expectation of athletic glory. No matter what they’ve gained, these kids have given up their childhoods for a dream that will eventually end. 
No matter where Darnold goes in the draft, he’ll still call it quits within a decade or two. I don’t mean this to be cynical, because I’m sure he’ll go in the top five and land himself in the Hall of Fame by the end of his career. But eventually, sports come to an end for every athlete. And what happens afterward?
For the kids who commit to this dream when they’re 12 or even younger, there’s a shift that scares me. How do you play for fun at a young age when you’re fighting for scholarships? How do you take a game lightly when it’s the only future you know? 
In my opinion, this is one of the ways Darnold moved his career in the right way. He played three sports in high school, focusing on basketball just as much as football all the way through his senior year. He had to be convinced to do elite academies as a college recruit, preferring pick-up games and his basketball team to the rigor of becoming an elite college recruit.
Darnold allowed himself to be a kid. And even as he now prepares for the draft, he can look back and feel reassured that he did this right in not growing up too soon. 
This is an approach that I wish more parents and young athletes alike took. There’s no rush to grow up, no rush to commit to a college and a future. Things change, and kids get bored or get hurt or find something else they love more. 
A year ago, the NCAA changed the rules of lacrosse recruiting to prohibit programs from approaching athletes before they entered high school. I hope that soon, similar rules will be developed for recruiting in all sports. Yes, playing sports at a highly competitive level helps kids to mature in many ways. But let’s help them stay kids a little longer.
