Morales came as a guest speaker for JOUR 572: Reporting on Entertainment and Popular Culture, which focuses on how journalists should cover the entertainment industry. However, USC students were welcome to attend the event. 
Morales is currently the West Coast anchor of the Today Show and also hosts the show Access Live. Prior to joining NBC, she worked at a variety of news organizations across the country, covering major news events like the Columbine mass shooting and 9/11.
Morales was interviewed by Annenberg associate professor Mary Murphy, who teaches JOUR 572. 
“[The class] is based on my own life experiences as a journalist,” Murphy said. “What I had to do as a journalist covering pop culture is I had to be aware of everything … I designed the course based on the real life experience and being a journalist in Los Angeles.”
Students in the graduate course are given many opportunities to experience the industry firsthand, from visiting the set of the hit TV show Mom to meeting with James Corden, host of the Late Late Show. Morales was the class’s first guest speaker. 
While she ultimately graduated with degrees in journalism and Latin American studies from Rutgers University, Morales said she spent many of her college years unsure of what career path she wanted to follow, and she encouraged the audience to explore a variety of paths while in school. 
“Getting a breadth of experience really is what then allowed me to say ‘this is what I love,’” Morales said. 
Morales grew up in a variety of Latin American countries, including Panama, Brazil and Spain, and she credits this worldly experience with helping her develop her skills as a reporter. 
“It really opened my eyes to the world at such a young age, and I realized very quickly that the world does not revolve around the U.S.,” Morales said. 
Morales, who speaks Spanish and Portuguese, touched on the opportunities that would not have been open to her had she not been trilingual, such as her coverage of the rescue of the Chilean coal miners in 2010.
Although Murphy asked Morales about recent sexual misconduct allegations against former Today Show host Matt Lauer, Morales avoided answering the question and said that allegations had already been covered to the fullest extent, so she didn’t want to comment further. 
Later in the interview, Morales reminded students that they have to work hard to succeed in journalism. 
“You can’t take too many shortcuts … You have to work your way up,” Morales said. “The best thing you can learn is to always say yes when it comes to somebody asking you to do something that is going to help you grow.”
Students in the class were grateful for the opportunity to talk with a professional in the industry they hope to join one day. 
“They can be so candid and you get one-on-one interaction with them,” Bridget Winstead, who is studying to get her master’s in public relations, said. “You can ask them genuine questions [and] they’ll give you genuine answers on the spot.”
According to Murphy, opportunities where students get to talk to professionals in their field are an important part of a comprehensive college education. 
“Learning from the people who are doing the job is an essential thing to learning what the job is,” Murphy said.

The LAC+USC Medical Center at the Health Sciences Campus unveiled its new Family Justice Center, a facility housed at the medical center that will provide services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and child and elder abuse.

The center was developed in partnership with the County of Los Angeles and the City of Los Angeles, and is based upon the nationally recognized Family Justice Center Alliance model, according to a press release from L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. 
According to L.A. Supervisor Hilda Solis’ website, the center is only the second of its kind in L.A. County. 
After Solis proposed using the LAC+USC Medical Center for the project, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors approved the center in June, according to Solis’ website. 
The center is designed to address all of the needs of victims in one place. Besides medical services, the Family Justice Center will also provide law enforcement resources and social services, the release said. 
The Board of Supervisors designated 5,400 square feet for the East Los Angeles Women’s Center, which will provide temporary shelter for victims and help them transition out of dangerous situations. They also designated 4,750 square feet for the Los Angeles Police Department, where victims can seek legal recourse with onsite police officers and investigators, according to minutes taken at the Board of Supervisors meeting where the board approved the proposal. 
“These men and women need a place of refuge where they can find comfort, guidance and all the services they need in one place,” Garcetti said at the facility opening, according to the release. “Together with our county partners, we have created this new Family Justice Center to give victims and their families the help and relief they deserve.”
By bringing together these services in one place, the Family Justice Center hopes to provide more effective and efficient aid to those in need.
“Too often, women and their families are driven into homelessness by domestic violence,” said Los Angeles City Councilmember José Huizar at the facility opening. “The Family Justice Center will help us respond to this horrific abuse and give domestic violence victims the support and security they need today, and the hope and inspiration they will surely need tomorrow.”
According to the press release, the Family Justice Center is the first step toward future projects in partnership with the LAC+USC Medical Center.
Waste of taxpayer money.

The Norman Topping Student Aid Fund Governing Board passed three motions at an emergency meeting on Thursday, including one to void Provost Michael Quick’s elimination of the Topping director position.

The first motion stated that the provost’s decision to restructure the Topping Fund, specifically the removal of Christina Yokoyama’s position as Topping Director, be voided and held invalid due to the lack of consultation and communication between the governing board and Quick. The motion was passed unanimously.
To address any potential issues with the program’s funding in the future, the second motion moved to “freeze all NTSAF funds, specifically any salary reallocations or changes made to the NTSAF operating budget, NTSAF endowment and student fees allocated to the NTSAF until the USC senior administration reverses the decision” to eliminate Yokoyama’s position.
This operating budget includes the salaries of Yokoyama, associate director Trista Beard, NTSAF Governing Board Chair Sierra Williams, and three existing graduate assistants.
The third motion, passed unanimously, specified that Quick must abide by the governing board guidelines and reverse any decisions that have violated the guidelines, including the elimination of the director position.
“We made these resolutions to make sure that the administration was not overstepping our authority as the governing board,” Williams said. 
The approved motions come the same day Topping students organized a sit-in at Tommy Trojan to protest the changes.
Since the provost’s memorandum last Friday notifying the modifications made to the overall organization of the program, Topping scholars, alumni and several faculty members have united to request a reversal of the provost’s decision and have Yokoyama’s position reinstated. 
While Williams initially planned to go over the governing board guidelines with vice provost of undergraduate programs Andrea Hodge and assistant vice provost David Glasgow in attendance, both notified the governing board 15 minutes after the scheduled meeting start time that they would not be attending. 
“David and I will not be able to attend the emergency meeting tonight,” Hodge wrote in an email to Williams, obtained by the Daily Trojan. “We look forward to meeting all of you soon.”
Williams explained that Hodge and Glasgow’s presence was expected, since Hodge had previously requested to meet with the board.
Neither Hodge nor Glasgow immediately responded to multiple requests for comment.
Earlier on Thursday, Topping scholars also gathered at Tommy Trojan to protest the provost’s decision.
This past week, David Delgado, a Topping senior majoring in gender studies and theatre, and several other members of the Topping Fund spearheaded the sit-in at Tommy Trojan. 
During the sit-in, which lasted six hours, scholars held posters that read “#SaveTopping.” The scholars also requested that students sign an online petition addressed to Provost Michael Quick, which was launched Wednesday night.
By the time of publication, the petition had received 1,202 signatures. 
“With an escalation plan, you want to slowly grow your movement,” Delgado said. “We didn’t want to do anything large and extremely verbose … Right now, we just want to touch the bases and make sure that the student population knows about what’s happening, that they are able to sign the petition if they support it and that they can get involved if they would like.”
On Friday, Yokoyama will be meeting with Quick to further discuss the reasons behind her elimination from the Topping Fund.
