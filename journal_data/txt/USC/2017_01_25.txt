Concentrated on the strengths of this man who stole a business from others, The Founder explains McDonald’s founder Ray Croc’s success, engaging the audience to think for themselves if this triumph is extraordinary and worth revering.
The movie begins in 1954, as Croc (Michael Keaton) is not yet an underlying force of fast food empire, but a salesman with his pitch to a prospective customer who isn’t impressed at all. Croc is frustrated not only with his failures in selling milkshakes to fast-food joints, but also with his unambitious wife Ethel (Laura Dern). He knows there is a relentless force and will deep inside his personality, which is not yet fully discovered. 
As viewers may know from history, Croc’s name is tied with the McDonald’s fast food empire, although he was not the first to envision a high efficient restaurant chain that became capable of providing customers orders within less than a minute. Croc visits the first San Bernardino McDonald’s station, and from this moment on, his life was never the same.
His character takes an opportunity to charm McDonald’s founders and open his franchise, thus evolving from a hopeless milkshake salesman into a fierce businessman with his own vision and personal driving force. He is not as talented and innovative as a founder of the biggest fast food enterprise should be, but Croc’s character certainly does not lack ability to turn everything around into his tools to achieve success. By calculating every detail and striving toward impeccable performance, Croc makes his fortune on the McDonald’s brand.  
The movie wavers between sympathizing Croc’s character while exposing his harmful energy. The Founder is supported by subplots with characters suffering from the main protagonist’s complicated and sometimes cruel personality.
For example, Croc’s loving wife, Ethel, was replaced by Joan (Linda Cardellini), who becomes his third wife but is more fitting for his character’s vision and understanding of life. The supporting actors create an important background for the main theme, escalating the viewer’s perception of Ray’s conflicting personality. 
Keaton gives a high-level performance through his character, delivering an old-fashioned life lesson on how weakness and absence of rigidness can cause a complete withdrawal from business. The decent side fallen from the power of Ray Croc’s grit is presented by McDonald’s brothers (Nick Offerman as Dick, John Caroll Lynch as Mac) who make the audience think about moral standards versus charismatic vices.
The Founder is a carefully executed movie that reveals the backstory of fast food chain development, intertwined with personal dramas. This combination works well with the audience, as the world of business may change with the new technologies and fast moving innovations, but the art of dealing with the obstacles on the way to success will always require people to push their limits — and this theme is highly relatable. This new film from John Lee Hancock (Saving Mr. Banks, The Blind Side) is an entertaining biopic and a great complement to the director’s collection of authentically American stories crafted with soul.

Los Angeles has long been revered as the center of innovative art. All types of artists — graphic designers, virtual reality artists and traditional painters — make pilgrimages to the vibrant city to participate in the latest, most cutting-edge ways to display and appreciate art. One of the most successful of these artistic ventures, the stARTup Art Fair, supports independent artists, entering its second year at Highland Gardens Hotel in Hollywood from Jan. 27 to Jan. 29. 
Co-founded in 2015 by USC alumnus Steve Zavattero, the stARTup Art Fair focuses on bringing the community together and fostering an appreciation for independent artists. Consequently, the artists keep all of their sales’ proceeds to support their artistic endeavors. 
“Our intimate, boutique fair provides artists and art enthusiasts with direct access to the art world, fostering new relationships and creating an unparalleled exhibition platform for thought-provoking contemporary artwork in the entertainment capital of the country,” the stARTup website states.
The stARTup Art Fair works to give access to independent, California-based artists who may not be able to afford or gain access to elite galleries. The event emphasizes a fair admission process, implementing a blind jury system to select the artists to be featured in the fair. The jury is comprised of several L.A. artists, art journal contributors and gallery owners from the area.
“We didn’t want this to be a pay-for-play situation, where someone just ponies up $5,000 and they get in,” said Ray Beldner, co-founder of the stARTup Art Fair, to the Los Angeles Times. 
Over the course of three days, the fair will host several exhibitions as well as “art conversations,” panels about topics relating to contemporary art. One panel, titled, “Rhizomatic Arts: The Hybrid Practice: Art & Entrepreneurship,” is a discussion between four artists who support their crafts as freelancers or creative business owners. The entrepreneurs and artists tackle the topic of maintaining a steady art practice while implementing business strategies within their own creative communities. 
“The panelists will discuss different shapes artistic careers might take and how one leverages their skills as artists to make an impact or fill a need outside the studio,” the description states online.
Another conversation, titled “The Collectivists,” focuses on the power and impact that artists can have if they unite to create lasting change.   
“The current surge of standout artist-run spaces has become a democratic movement; and en masse, artist collectives are challenging the established hierarchy of how the gallery system and commerce function in the art world,” according to the description online.
In addition to the traditional exhibits and panels, the fair has partnered with several non-profits and art centers, such as 18th Street Arts Center, to present four curated rooms. Fifty percent of ticket sales will also be donated to Lancaster Museum of Art and History, the stARTup Art Fair’s beneficiary museum this year. 
The stARTup Art Fair attracts several art experts from around the L.A. area, including art tarot reader Alexia Lewis, director and head curator of the Torrance Art Museum Max Presneill and GYST radio host Kara Tomé.
Update: This post has been updated to reflect that the stARTup Art Fair was co-founded by USC alumnus Steve Zavattero.

USC’s underground events venue, Tommy’s Place, is bringing a wide variety of events to campus this semester. The venue is home to weekly trivia nights, movie nights, sporting events, monthly band nights and the all new Tommy-oke, a karaoke night. 
Located in the basement of Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Tommy’s Place is operated by USC Trojan Event Services. The venue has hosted hundreds of events throughout the year, such as a conversation with pop singer Halsey, a meet and greet with the indie band the Neighbourhood, Comedy Nights with the Upright Citizens Brigade and other student-related events. 
Trojan Event Services and USC Student Affairs hope that the venue can be a social space accessible to students both for attending events and producing them. The department offers a discount for student organization rentals and hopes to create new partnerships with organizations to help them produce events that USC students can enjoy. 
In addition to events by student organization, Tommy’s Place hosts many self-produced events, their most popular being trivia nights with themes like Star Wars, the Beatles and sports. 
The newest self-produced event to hit Tommy’s Place this Thursday night is Tommy-oke, the venue’s karaoke night.
“We love to emphasize our concert quality sound and lighting systems and make them available to our students,” said Michael Prenger, senior director for student engagement for USC Student Affairs. “When one of our full-time staff members mentioned going to Tommy-oke as a student a few years ago, it immediately jumped out as something we wanted bring back. Anyone can enjoy Tommy-oke, whether you’re there to watch or to sing, and at Tommy’s Place, we’re always looking for free events everyone can enjoy.”
Students can grab a bite to eat in Traditions and then head over to Tommy’s Place to belt out some hits. Attendees will be able to choose their favorite songs and sing their hearts out on stage with professional sound and lighting, as well as lyrics. 
In addition to Tommy-oke, Tommy’s Place will also be hosting its monthly band night this Friday, with USC artists Michael Arrom, Julia Ryan and the Way and No Telescopes. A senior majoring in the popular music program, Michael Arrom began playing piano at the age of 18. 
Julia Ryan and the Way is led by senior Julia Ryan McLane, who gathered a group of funky, upbeat fellow musicians. The group’s groovy style will keep the audience on their feet with a full horn section and jazzy basslines.
Also performing this Friday is No Telescopes, an alternative rock band with musicians Skyler Garn, Dave Fulmer, Austin Shaw, Chris Robinson and Nick Brumme. 
Tommy-oke will take place on Thursday Jan . 26 from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. January Band Night will be occurring on Friday Jan. 27 from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.

Anxiety can be both beneficial and dangerous to a musician’s career. In John Beder’s documentary film Composed, he exposes musicians’ struggle with anxiety and the ways they cope with it. USC Thornton Health and Wellness Committee held a screening of Composed and a live Q&A with Beder alongside multiple USC Thornton School of Music faculty members on Tuesday.
According to the film, 98 percent of concert musicians have experienced and struggled with music performance anxiety. The film reveals how professional musicians grapple with symptoms of anxiety, particularly in auditions, and how it conflicts with their performance.
“We made this film because we are musicians,” Beder said. “I remember, very clearly, being 18 years old trying to play something very soft and quiet on the snare drums and watching as my hands shook violently — to the point where I couldn’t even attempt the excerpt.”
Performance anxiety can be detrimental to a performance, and this disorder caused Rod Gilfry, a concert vocalist and associate professor of vocal arts at Thornton, to lose his job at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
“I got fired because my anxiety about two of the passages were very high,” Gilfry said. “They kept on coming back to it, and it got worse and worse … and they finally let me go.”
Although performance anxiety is a common condition for musicians, it is often ignored and goes undocumented. The film noted that hypnosis, yoga, meditation, neuroassociative conditioning and mindfulness thinking can help musicians with anxiety symptoms. Lynn Helding, an associate professor of voice and voice pedagogy at Thornton, discussed her research on the subject.
“There really hasn’t been any one or even five things that seem to work,” Helding said. “It’s really up to each person to know themselves and then try different things, and … seek help. The one thing, however, that seems to be the most helpful is when other performers share their stories.”
Beta blockers, a prescription originally given to patients with heart conditions, are a controversial remedy that some musicians turn to as a cure-all and obtain without a prescription. Some musicians are actually prescribed beta blockers, but those who are not can develop an unhealthy dependency  that diminishes the authenticity of their performance.
“There is no quick fix,” said Michael Johns, the director of the USC Voice Center. “Seek medical attention for this. There are folks who will help you navigate your issues both in terms of psychological support and even medical therapy.” 
In moderation, anxiety can be beneficial and healthy. The film explained the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which illuminates the relationship between anxiety and arousal. Every individual has a specific pocket of anxiety that will bring a peaked arousal, which is beneficial in a musician’s performance. 
Whatever level of performance anxiety a performer has, Composed brings light to an issue that many performers fear in their daily life. It brings assurance that no one musician is alone with this condition. 
“You see a problem?” Johns said. “Do you have a passion for it? Create the solution. You can do it. There are no barriers around you. There are opportunities for leadership wherever you are in your life journey.”

It appears that Big Brother has traded in his binoculars for earbuds. Section 27400 of the California Vehicle Code, effective Jan.1, prohibits a person from biking while wearing “a headset covering, earplugs in or earphones covering, resting on or inserted in, both ears.” At $178, the fine for violation of the new restrictions is substantial, though the realistic repercussions of such an act are not. Wearing headphones while bicycling tends to be a victimless crime, so long as pedestrians remain mindful of their surroundings. Arguably, no one is endangered — save the bicyclist. In this sense, the overreach of the nanny state has gone far enough.
The USC Bicycle Coalition estimates that between 6,000 and 9,000 bicycles roam campus on any given weekday. Mix that statistic with the ever-present tendency for earbuds to be hanging from the ears of college students, and you have countless easy targets for LAPD officers who are more concerned with individuals’ personal lives than helping to prevent real crimes.
Already, some students have already been stopped at intersections by the LAPD on the way to USC for non-compliance with the new earbud restrictions. However, none claimed they had been informed of the limitations on their ability to listen to music or talk on the phone while commuting before receiving their citations.
USC failed to adequately issue a warning about the new policy to the Trojan community, ignoring the thousands of bike-riding Trojans who ride to and from campus every day. In the same way USC makes an effort to inform students of notable incidents of crime and relevant changes in school policy, the administration must also bring changes to laws in California that stand to burden students to the Trojan community’s attention.
However, even with the lack of notice by USC’s administration, the new law shows that we have a long way to go in the arena of basic civil liberties. Yes, we can buy alcohol and cigarettes, vote for the next president, go to war for our country, drive two-ton automobiles and even own guns if we meet certain state requirements. But when it comes to wearing headphones while riding a bike on the way to class, that’s not safe — so says our state government.
The new headphone law reminds us of other overbearing provisions adopted around the country in recent years. A soda tax, adopted in cities such as San Francisco, Berkeley and Philadelphia among others, places the personal choices of American diets into the overreaching hands of big government bureaucrats. A bill introduced in New Jersey back in March aimed to fine pedestrians for walking and texting simultaneously. Another initiative issued by the FDA in June called for reductions in salt content in a range of food products produced in the United States, without consumer input.
It is not up to the government to save us from ourselves. For Americans living in the proverbial People’s Republic of California, overreaching laws, such as this new headphone law, force us to question to what extent we are really free individuals with the right to make our own decisions and take our own actions. The government should not look at citizens as misguided invalids who are lost without policy oversight, and it is time to recognize the importance of personal liberty and agency of the individual in making our own victimless decisions.
Non story, this change in the law was invisible to bicyclists. It was already prohibited. This change added a specific type of hearing system to the list of prohibited devices. And, yes none of this should be prohibited.
There’s an old saying that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  If you want to discuss the Communist Party of CA, you should take a look at what the state legislature and Gov Brown are trying make law.  Raising state income taxes, managing a bankrupt treasury, pushing for CA to be a sanctuary state and to support sanctuary cities, letting hundreds of millions of gallons of water to run off in the ocean m instead of capturing the water for future use…. CA is truE to its nam… the Left Coast.  And that’s a shame.

In response to the inauguration of President Donald Trump, Saturday’s Women’s March saw millions of women and feminist allies take to the streets to stand up for their rights, with roughly 750,000 marching in Los Angeles alone. Though the march was a celebration of inclusion and diversity, women who oppose abortion have since blasted the protest, its participants and modern feminism at large for excluding “pro-life feminists.” This naturally raises the age-old question of whether those who oppose a woman’s right to autonomy over her body have claim to the title “feminist.” 
By no means is this a simple debate. But particularly in the context of Saturday’s historic Women’s March, the ability to be a woman and object to abortion appears to be a privilege that low-income, minority women can’t afford. The Women’s March was about so much more than women and abortion; it was a rally of solidarity in defense of all marginalized groups attacked by Trump’s rhetoric and policies, reflective of modern feminism’s move toward inclusiveness and intersectionality. 
To be a feminist today, you must not only support the human rights of  affluent, heterosexual, cisgender white women, but also acknowledge the disproportionate historical and modern implications of abortion restrictions on poor, immigrant women of color. Economic barriers to contraception and legal barriers to abortion have historically resulted in the entrapment of marginalized women in intergenerational cycles of poverty as they are forced to birth children they cannot afford, and violently mauled in back-alley abortions. Research has shown that the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding from going toward abortions for women on Medicaid, among other restrictions on the procedure, disproportionately affects women of color, prioritizing the ideologies of some over the dignity and needs of low-income women.
Speaking of back-alley abortions, which continue to this day in states with few clinics and a myriad of regulations deemed by the medical community as medically unnecessary, what abortion opponents can’t ignore is that it’s only possible to ban safe abortion — whether or not abortion is legal, it will continue to happen at the same rate, but at the expense of women’s safety. Opposition to abortion puts less privileged women’s health and safety at risk while also reducing them to the indignity of navigating the black market for basic healthcare. 
Women of all races and classes are united by the simple fact that opposition to abortion is rooted in reducing them to second-class citizens whose rights are worth less than those of fertilized eggs,  ignoring the most basic science of fetal viability at women’s expense. Not only do pro-life feminists who rally under the “women deserve better than abortion” slogan tend to be conservative-leaning opponents of funding for contraception, but they often also fail to answer the question of what “women deserve better” means: Objectively speaking, abortion is a safe, dignified procedure like any other. The stigma around it is just the disguised, age-old hatred of women exerting control.
No combination of any contraception offers 100 percent safeguard against nature, and to oppose abortion is to approve of select, unlucky women being punished by biology in a way men never will be. Fifty-one percent of women who have abortions used some form of contraception that failed. 
Ultimately, if women deserve better, so do their children, and not just when their children are fetuses. To be pro-life and not just anti-abortion, support paid family leave, wider access to healthcare, and investment in education and the social safety net that disproportionately help single mothers and their children.
Feminism is not nearly as complicated as portrayed by its critics: It is merely the recognition of women as human beings. If the right to choose to have children is a human right, it’s one feminists should support.
I participated in the Women’s March on Saturday, and the last thing it sought to do was divide women and shame them for their differences. It celebrated diversity of identity as well as diversity of the beliefs that we each uniquely bring to the table. There’s a simple reason this column about feminism is called “You Do Uterus”: Feminism is about encouraging women to be themselves and make their own choices, however different these choices are from anyone else’s. On the other hand, feminism is not opposing women’s right to make choices, whether it’s to wear makeup or not or to have an abortion or give birth, simply because you wouldn’t make the same one. 
In this sense, anti-abortion women’s ideology is inherently in conflict with feminism, but it isn’t fair to sweepingly call them sexists; they merely favor policies with disproportionately sexist consequences. And just as it’s their choice to support policies that prevent other women from the right to choose, it’s my choice to refuse to recognize them as feminists.

On Thursday night, Undergraduate Student Government campaigns will become public and candidates will be unveiling their positions on campus issues. It is worth recalling that last year, only 3,700 students — less than 20 percent of the undergraduate population — cast their ballots in the Undergraduate Student Government election. To put that in perspective, more people in Kentucky in Knox County wrote in candidates such as Dolly Parton and The Walking Dead character Rick Grimes than USC students voted at all last year. It’s no secret that millennials tend to not show up to vote at national elections, but it’s surprising and concerning that so few students take the time to invest themselves in decisions that affect nearly every aspect of their college experience. But it’s a new year and a new student body — so let’s find our voices and register our votes.
Elections provide an opportunity for people to express their beliefs, but the fact that not even 4,000 students voted last year — even with incentives like free In-N-Out — is discouraging, to say the least. This low voter turnout reflects not only our political apathy, but also our indifference toward how our campus runs. We talk about civic engagement and political participation on the national level — and even at the state and local ones — but there’s no reason that these concepts shouldn’t apply to our colleges. After all, it’s the policies created and enforced on campus that have a greater effect on us than many federal and other laws. 
In the midst of lingering issues such as mental health awareness, silence is no longer an option. The options in the dining hall and on campus affect our health and well-being; policies related to sexual assault determine whether survivors receive the justice that they deserve; and tuition hikes often force students to take out more loans or even leave the school. Despite the progress of recent administrations, USC still struggles with transparency, affordability, sustainability and accessibility. Despite efforts by both students and faculty, many Trojans still feel disenfranchised, frustrated and voiceless. Despite recent initiatives, more work remains to be done to transform University Park Campus into a more socially, politically and environmentally aware campus. And with the advent of President Donald Trump’s administration, the question remains how USC should respond to federal policies, such as its stances on environmental protection and student debt.
It’s easy to doubt whether a student government can advance progress, much less affect a single student’s life. But realize that this isn’t your typical high school student government. Equipped with a staff of over 100 students and a budget of over $2 million, USG hosts dozens of events from concerts to speaker series, advocates for policies such as tuition freezes and makes structural changes, from extending dining hall and library hours to forging a partnership with Uber.
But voting isn’t passively checking a box — it’s an active decision that requires research and deliberation. We have the opportunity to elect a president, vice president and 12 senators — it’s our responsibility to weigh our options, determine which candidates align with our own positions and make informed decisions. At the very least, this should make us more aware of campus issues and steer us toward making a difference ourselves. We owe it to ourselves and to our fellow students.
Civic engagement is a lifelong pursuit, and it should begin here at USC. Too many millennials may have stayed home in 2016, but 2017 can mark a new year of student engagement, progress and, of course, free In-N-Out.

Undergraduate Student Government President Edwin Saucedo described the final projects he is working to implement during the remainder of his term at the USG meeting Tuesday. Chief among these are his plans to establish a resource center for first-generation college students, a fall break and a stipend for student leaders on campus.
Saucedo began by explaining his goal of creating a resource center for first-generation, low-income students, modeled after others such as the LGBT Resource Center. Part of this project involved working with the University administration as well as with members of student government in other universities to come up with a plan to support first-generation students. Saucedo said he had submitted a proposal for a resource center to Provost Michael Quick and had discussed the idea with President C. L. Max Nikias.
“Being first-generation at an elite university can be an intimidating process. The idea for a resource center is about addressing the needs of the students to make them successful in an academic setting. Being able to provide them with resources such as career mentoring opportunities and different programming will help to create a community among students.”
Saucedo said he has been working with Trista Beard, the associate director of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund and chair of the First-Generation Student Union, and Associate Provost Andrea Hodge to put together best practices for first-generation college students. He brought up the example set by different universities including Stanford University and Brown University, both of which have resource centers like the one he hopes to implement at USC. Saucedo said he hopes to have a center set up for first-generation students by the end of the school year.
Beyond his first-generation college student project, Saucedo also discussed his plan to create a two-day break between the eighth and 10th weeks of the fall semester, which he said will be ready to present on Feb. 15. Saucedo said he was discussing the project with Academic Senate President Paula Cannon, and that a final resolution would be ready by March 29.
“If we look at the fall semester, between Labor Day break and Thanksgiving, our school currently has 56 instructional days, one of the largest amounts of instructional days without a break in the nation compared to peer institutions,” Saucedo said. “That’s 11 weeks for students without a chance to breathe. This has to do with promoting an environment where students can address mental health issues and not feel so stressed out.”
Finally, Saucedo announced his plans to move forward with the Positional Leadership Stipend, which he first introduced one year ago when he was still the USG Finance Director.  The stipend, according to Saucedo, is intended to meet the needs of low-income students who have to choose between having a job or being able to get involved on campus. Students in any official, unpaid leadership position on campus —  such as a club officership — would be eligible to apply to receive funding, which would reflect the compensation that paid positions such as USG members receive. 
“The stipend is similar to a scholarship opportunity, so that students can choose to get involved instead of having to [work to] meet their finances,” Saucedo said.
Last spring, Saucedo implemented a pilot program for the stipend, which he said received 65 applications requesting over $70,000 in award money. After seeing this interest, Saucedo decided to bring the stipend back this semester, and he is currently working to allocate the funding from different USG accounts.
After Saucedo reviewed his final plans as president, the Senate also approved its new exceptional funding allocation, which encompasses any additional money USG received this semester that was not originally anticipated. Saucedo said this often results when last year’s USG budget underestimates the next semester’s enrollment. This year, USG calculated $145,057 in exceptional funding, which will be distributed to different USG organizations such as the Concerts Committee, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and Environmental Student Assembly.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated Saucedo announced his plans to create a two-week fall break. His actually plans to create a two-day fall break. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The first 100 days of Donald Trump’s administration will span most of the rest of the semester. On Tuesday, students and professors gathered to discuss what this would mean for American foreign policy. The event, entitled “America’s Role in the World in the Era of Trump,” is the first of the series hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
The panel was moderated by Unruh Institute Director and featured Jefferey Sellers, an associate professor of political science and public policy; Nina Rathburn, an associate professor of international relations; and Luke Phillips, a senior studying international relations.
Panelists were asked everything from the situation in the Middle East to Brexit and the rise of “alt-right” movements in Europe and China. They also discussed possible foreign policy avenues that Trump might take, including the fight against ISIS, the United States’ relationship with Russia and the recent withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Unlike his predecessors, the President has no clear-cut foreign policy agenda, so the panelists relied heavily on conjecture based on campaign promises and Trump’s Twitter account. They also used the inaugural speech  as a possible indication of his policies.
“One thing that is clear about the Trump administration is that they’re going to gear policy towards the U.S. and the electorate,” Sellers said, referencing Trump’s “America First” promise in his inaugural speech last Friday.
Rathbone, however, disagreed. She said that an “American First” foreign policy is almost impossible to achieve based on previous entanglements abroad and the global society that we live in today. She explained that there is no way to know exactly what Trump is thinking or how he will structure his administration’s foreign policy. 
“I would recommend to ignore a lot of the Twitter feed of the Trump administration,” Rathbone said. “I don’t think even he means to have a lasting impact.” 
Rathbone said that though Twitter was the main avenue of communication that Trump used to communicate with his supporters during the campaign, that may not be the case now that he is in the White House.
Phillips agreed and pointed out the prominence of foreign policy in President Trump’s messaging. 
“Foreign policy seems to be much of a branding effort for the Trump administration, dating back to the campaign,” Phillips said. 
The panel from the Unruh Institute was the first since the election of Trump. Unruh will continue to hold evening programming on Tuesday nights for students discussing the current state of politics.

John “Jack” Wills Jr., professor emeritus of history, died on Jan. 13 in Pasadena, Calif. He was 80.
Wills was known for teaching Chinese history. He helped found the East Asian Studies Center in 1975, and he directed the center from 1990 to 1994.
“This is a man who grew intellectually more and more the longer he operated,” Professor Emeritus of History Gordon Berger told USC News. “He had this wonderfully original and creative mind.”
Wills published his book Mountain of Fame: Portraits in Chinese History in 1994. His book went through 5,000 years of history, illustrating the lives of the most important political figures of China. Wills’ other works included 1688: A Global History and The World from 1450 to 1700. Wills also wrote more than 50 articles about China, according to USC News.
Wills began teaching at USC in 1965. After retiring in 2004, he continued to be active on the USC campus. In 2006, Wills donated $50,000 for a graduate scholarship for those majoring in East Asian studies.
He earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Wills received his Ph.D. in history and far Eastern languages at Harvard University after serving in the U.S. Army.
“He was a wonderful collaborator,” professor emerita of history Charlotte Furth told USC News. “He was a force to be reckoned with in the history department and in the University. He made my career at USC possible and that was very important to me.”
Wills is survived by his wife, Carolin “Connie” Wills; his children Cathy, Chris, Jeff, Joanne and Lucinda; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

The National Hockey League brought one of its most iconic trophies to the center of campus Tuesday to promote All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles.
Students had a chance to take selfies and pose with the Stanley Cup in front of Tommy Trojan, while NHL staff handed out free tickets for the NHL Fan Fair on Thursday. USC Residential Education hosted the event and encouraged students to attend to earn points for the Residential College Cup. 
Bill Miller, vice president of NHL events, said it’s important to include college students who may not be able to afford All-Star tickets in the NHL experience. 
“At the very least it brings a little joy to them,” Miller said. “They get to see the cup.”
On Tuesday, Hockey fans posed in front of the cup sporting gear that represented their hometown NHL teams. One family posed with their baby, while others used this opportunity to check an item off on their bucket list.
“They can touch it, give it a kiss – even though thousands of people have kissed [it], people still do it,” said Brendon Lamphear, the NHL’s All-Star location supervisor. “We like giving them a little show, and what better spot than Tommy Trojan.”
This weekend’s All-Star game is in its 62nd year, though colleges only became involved in 2014. In previous years, the cup was displayed at The Ohio State University and Vanderbilt University. Mike Bolt, one of the cup’s handlers who spends 330 days out of the year with it, said it is one of the most unique trophies in sports. 
“This doesn’t hide behind glass — it’s always open to the public doing events, and every day it’s taking pictures with our great fans,” Bolt said. 
Hockey fans were especially ecstatic to get photos with the trophy they hoped their teams would win one day. Anant Jain, a freshman majoring in computer science, said he hopes that the San Jose Sharks will win the Stanley Cup for the first time ever after they lost in the finals last year. 
“I heard this was here and I’m a big ice hockey fan, so I definitely wanted to come over here and get a picture with the Stanley Cup,” Jain said. “It doesn’t mean much for me right now because I’m a fan of the San Jose Sharks and we haven’t won the Stanley cup yet, but we can dream.” 
Los Angeles has a hockey team, the Kings, but All-Star Weekend will bring even more support for the sport on the West Coast and throughout the country. 
“I know the Kings have won the Stanley Cup and everyone’s excited during those years, but for it to be here on a different year and have NHL Weekend here or All-Star Weekend … it’s a big deal,” said Isha Rahman, a senior majoring in human biology.
Hockey may not be as popular on campus as sports like football and basketball, but Lamphear is excited to bring the Stanley Cup to long-time fans.
“We’re kind of that fourth sport but hockey fans themselves are truly dedicated, and so what we like doing is bringing the oldest trophy and most respected trophy out there to people,” Lamphear said. 
Bolt said that the NHL tries to bring out the hockey fans in every university that they visit. 
“There’s hockey fans in every university campus and this is the greatest trophy in sports, whether you are a hockey fan or not,” Bolt said.

Steven Kramer | Daily Trojan
It is always impressive when a player crushes the competition that is presented to her. But it’s even more impressive when someone goes out of her way to seek out and battle the highest level of competition available — and that’s the story for women’s lacrosse’s senior attacker Michaela Michael. 
“It’s different growing up in California. Obviously, California lacrosse isn’t the biggest thing — it’s not usually considered a hotbed for talent,” Michael said. “When I was in the eighth grade, I realized that the high school I was planning on [attending] didn’t have lacrosse, so I decided to apply to some private schools that did.” 
At Menlo School in Atherton, Calif., Michael became a four-time letter winner in lacrosse. Michael also competed for the Bay Area Wave club lacrosse team throughout her
high school years. In addition to her lacrosse pursuits, Michael lettered in soccer as a sophomore at Menlo.
“Looking back, it was kind of weird that I had to seek out competition, but that was really helpful for me and playing against some of the older girls gave me some good role models,” Michael said. “Finding coaching was always kind of an active search. If I heard that a college player I knew moved out into my area, I would go online and find a way to get in contact with them to see if they could work with me. I wanted to get as much coaching as I could, but it wasn’t just around me.”
At Menlo, Michael was honored as an First Team All-American in 2011 and 2012. She was also honored as an All-American on multiple occasions by Under Armour during her high school career. 
“When I was recruiting [Michael], I knew she was a special player,” head coach Lindsey Munday said in an interview with U.S. Lacrosse Magazine. “She’s tall, athletic, fast, strong, but you could tell that she had this edge about her that was really going to translate at the next level.”
Since arriving on campus as a freshman in 2014, Michael has established herself as arguably the top offensive threat in USC lacrosse’s young history. Michael holds the program record for free position goals (45), game-winning goals (12) and draw controls (275). She ranks in the top three all-time for the Trojans in almost every offensive category, including points (206, second all-time), shots on goal (235, second), goals (156, second) and assists (50, third). Michael is projected to hold every offensive career record by the end of her senior season this spring. 
Michael attributes much of her on-field successes to Munday and assistant coach Alyssa Leonard, who was an All-American and NCAA champion as a player at Northwestern. 
“[Leonard] has made all the difference for me,” Michael said. “She got here my sophomore year, and she began working with me three to four times a week … She’s taken me under her wing and taught me things that made her successful.” 
Michael started all 18 games for USC as a freshman. She scored a total of 25 goals and recorded six assists in her first season. Michael won MPSF Rookie of the Week honors in March 2014. 
In her sophomore campaign, Michael was named MVP of the MPSF after tallying 76 points on 63 goals and 13 assists. Michael then became the first player in program history to earn All-American honors (Third Team) in 2015. 
As a junior in 2016, Michael broke her own single-season records for goals (68), game-winning goals (6) and draw controls (123). Michael also set USC single-season records for points (99), shots on goal (96) and free-position goals (22) in 2016.
“The only reason I record goals and assists is for the team’s success,” Michael said. “I don’t care about the stat sheet. I care about the results of the games. That’s my motivation: Is this team getting
somewhere it wants to be?”
In just its fourth season of existence in 2016, the lacrosse program launched itself into national contention with a record-breaking regular season. USC (20-1 overall last season) won the 2016 MPSF league championship and finished the season as the No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament, while Munday took home 2016 MPSF Coach of the Year honors. During the season, the Trojans also put together an MPSF-record 20-game winning streak.
After becoming the first West Coast school in history to host an NCAA Tournament game, USC fell to Syracuse 12-11 in overtime of the NCAA Quarterfinals. 
“You don’t just get over and forget about a game like that one,” Michael said. “Having an overtime heartbreak like that, there’s nothing you can do about that except try and get back to that point. And that’s what we’re trying to do.” 
The Women of Troy will open this season as the favorite to win the MPSF championship. After USC finished No. 4 in the final 2016 NCAA standings, expectations will be at their highest for the team in 2017. 
Entering the new season, USC will be without some of its biggest assets that were at its disposal in 2016. Defender and last year’s MPSF MVP Courtney Tarleton (who graduated last spring) will be one of the crucial pieces that USC will be forced to function without this season. 
“[Tarleton] was awesome,” Michael said. “She really matured and came into her own as a player. She set herself apart on the field.”
Michael is one of four USC players to receive Preseason All-American honors entering 2017, but above the many merits she has garnered, Michael has her eyes set on one goal for her senior season: bringing USC its first NCAA title in program history. 
“It’s just going to come down to doing the little things right and having a solid team atmosphere,” Michael said. “Winning won’t just come down to the Xs and Os, it will be about playing as a team.”
Michael sees a national championship as the fruit of the labor that she has poured into a program that only existed from one year prior to her arrival on campus. 
“It was totally a leap of faith,” Michael said. “I knew that if I chose any of the top five programs that I was looking at, I would get to play in a Final Four or a National Championship game at some point in my four years. Coming to USC, I wasn’t sure if we would even have a winning season over my four years, just because there wasn’t a tradition of lacrosse here.” 
For Michael, humble beginnings in the sport have sprouted into an exalted collegiate career.
“I was nine when I started playing, but I didn’t even know what lacrosse was,” Michael said. “I actually thought it was like field hockey, so I kept hitting the ball on the ground. That was my first experience with it.” 
That childhood curiosity with the stick has since evolved into brilliance on the lacrosse field.
Fight on, Kerrigan Miller!!!!

Two Trojans took home Player of the Week honors this week due to their weekend performances. Junior Gabby Smith was recognized on the women’s tennis team, while senior driver Stephania Haralabidis won the award for women’s water polo.
Smith was named Pac-12 Player of the Week for the second time in her career on Monday, after she helped USC top UC Santa Barbara in its season opener last Thursday. Smith dropped her doubles match to start the day, but she rebounded with a momentum-shifting 7-6 (5), 6-0 victory in singles play. Smith is currently riding a six-match unbeaten streak, including an undefeated weekend at the National Collegiate Tennis Classic earlier this month. During the tournament, Smith defeated Arizona’s No. 18-ranked Lauren Marker 6-0, 6-3. Smith and her doubles partner, senior Zoë Katz, are also currently ranked No. 18 in the nation.
Haralabidis then earned MPSF Player of the Week honors on Tuesday. The senior tallied an incredible 17 goals in five games over the weekend, as USC stormed to a perfect 5-0 record at the UCSB Winter Invitational. Haralabidis scored in every single game of the tournament and also set a new career high with nine goals in the final game against hosts No. 9 UCSB — which also matched a single-game MPSF record. She has now scored on 202 occasions as a Trojan, eighth most in program history. Three more goals will push her
up to No. 7.
Both players will look to defend their titles this weekend. Smith and the women’s tennis team will head to Auburn, Ala. for the ITA Kickoff Weekend on Saturday, while Haralabidis and women’s water polo will make a trip to Riverside for the Cal Baptist Invitational, which also begins on Saturday.

Nothing lasts forever.
That’s true of many things, but nowhere is it truer than in sports. Dynasties, winning streaks, losing streaks and healthy quarterbacks — they’re all cut short eventually. The Curse of the Billy Goat at Wrigley Field collapsed this year, and Connecticut’s 94-game run will someday come to an end. Even Steph Curry couldn’t keep his team at the top
of the league forever. 
It’s odd because, for most of us, sports are a constant. We wear the same jerseys every year, grumble about the same coaches and curse the same rivals. There’s upheaval, yes, when the underdog takes the championship or a star player is traded away. But sports themselves are always there.
Which is why, when something does end, it feels like such a shock. When the Cubs win the World Series. When Kevin Durant puts on a Warriors jersey. When Peyton Manning retires. There’s a bittersweet quality to this sudden change, an understanding that nothing will ever feel quite the same.
When a player dies, it’s something entirely different. It feels like something has been stolen.
On Sunday, Kansas City Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura died in a car crash in the Dominican Republic. He was only 25. The news moved quickly. I found out from a Bleacher Report notification as I headed to the Daily Trojan office in the rain, wiping water off my screen to reread the words. 
It was a sinking feeling, made almost overdramatic by the rare L.A. rainstorm soaking through my jacket. I didn’t have words for the feeling. 
My hometown lowered flags to half-mast and lit up downtown in our colors of blue. Fans gathered outside Kaufmann Stadium with flowers and candles in hand. A dozen Royals players caught the red-eye to the Dominican, unable to stop crying during their phone interviews with ESPN.
The day taught me what I’d always known and yet always forget — how sports, in all their grit and beauty, tie us together and tear us apart over our love of these talented strangers whose time is often cut too short. 
Ventura didn’t exactly fit the typical mold of the Royals. He was tall and scrawny and baby faced, the brim of his cap always seeming too wide for his head. He mouthed off from the mound and incited every bench-clearing brawl over Kansas City’s two-year run to the World Series. He was scrappy and hot-headed and fiercely competitive, and my God, his fastball was a thing of beauty.
As fans, we didn’t mind his rough edges. We liked the young guy, barely older than a college kid, who slung 100 mile-per-hour pitches and snarled at opponents and snatched balls straight out of the air. And for every fist fight that he started — and, of course, lost — there were equal times that we caught that puppy dog smile that he flashed when he shut down the top
hitter in the league.
“You were a tough one to deal with,” Royals infielder Cristian Colon said after Ventura’s death. “But your love and smile could always make everything OK.”
Colon’s words sum up who Ventura was to us. Something about him captured the spirit of being young and being an athlete, of being in love with a game and a team. He was just getting started. Which is why, in part, his death felt so devastating.
Here’s the thing about Ventura — he was supposed to be a success story. 
This was a kid who dropped out of school as a 14-year-old to pick up a construction job to support his family. He tried out for the Royals with not much more than a lofty dream and a brilliant fastball, and he came up alongside Mike Moustakas and Salvador Perez on the Royals’ famed farm teams.
Ten years after dropping out of high school, Ventura became a World Series champion. It’s one of those stories, the type of happy ending that makes your heart feel warm and fuzzy.
A year and a half later, he died in a car crash as unexpected as it was inexplicable. It’s horrific and devastating, and it just doesn’t make sense. It’s not how the story is supposed to go.
There was already a taste of tragedy in Ventura’s past. On the morning of Game 6 during the 2014 World Series, Ventura’s friend and St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras died in a car crash in their home country. 
Ventura wrote Taveras’ initials and number on his cap, dedicating the game — a victory for the Royals — to his friend’s legacy. He spoke afterwards about the impact that the tragedy impressed upon him.
“You never know what’s going to happen tomorrow,” Ventura said after Game 6. “[My] biggest goal is to not leave anything behind, to give everything you have knowing that that could be the last game.”
That was a truth that Ventura knew, a truth that ended up spelling out the end of his life — that life is short, that every game, every season, could be the last.
It’s a painful lesson to learn in this way, but it’s one that I think must be remembered as often as possible. Things end, no matter what we say or do. And if Ventura taught us anything, it was how to live with fire, no matter the day or the game or the opponent.
My family loves baseball movies, and we have one favorite: Field of Dreams. In the days since Ventura’s death, I’ve thought often of that film, of the nostalgic image of an eternal baseball diamond for the greats of the game.
I hope Ventura found that diamond. I hope he’s playing ball with Taveras, slinging fastballs past Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle. Because life is short, and an athlete’s prime is even shorter, and Ventura didn’t get enough of either. And if a player like him deserves anything, it’s a lifetime or two more of throwing from the mound.

After losing at home to Arizona last Saturday, UCLA (19-2, 6-2) fell outside the top five in the AP poll for the first time in eight weeks. Meanwhile, USC (17-4, 4-4) received votes for the ninth straight week. The two teams were part of an elite corps of six that finished non-conference play undefeated. With UCLA off to its best start since the 2006-07 season — which saw them reach the Final Four — and USC off to its best start since 1971-72, Angelenos have been anticipating Wednesday’s game for quite some time. In fact, tickets sold out nearly one month ago. 
The Trojans will need to feed off the home-crowd energy delivered by 10,000-plus fans, including 1,500 raucous students. USC has won 27 of its last 31 home contests, but UCLA excels on the road, and it will surely bring a sizeable contingent of fans to the Galen Center, too. The Bruins are 4-1 away from home this season, with their sole loss coming from a buzzer-beater miracle at Oregon.
Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
In UCLA’s rare losses, it has allowed 92.5 points per game. USC has scored 93 points three times this season — once in an overtime victory — but the Trojans average 69.9 points per game in conference play. 
Basketball statistician Ken Pomeroy ranks UCLA 127th in defensive efficiency, as the team has allowed 80.6 points per game in Pac-12 play. However, the Bruins have hid their defensive deficiencies behind one of the best scoring offenses in the nation. UCLA head coach Steve Alford has a repertoire of skilled guards on his team, as well as six double-digit scorers.
The Bruins share the ball better than all of their conference foes. Their 22.3 assists-per-game is the highest mark in the Pac-12. Freshman prodigy Lonzo Ball leads the conference with 8.0 assists-per-game, and the guard’s ball-handling skills are unparalleled. He has maintained a 3.58 assist/turnover ratio this season — a full-point better than all other point guards in the league. 
No one scores more prolifically on UCLA than the coach’s son, senior guard Bryce Alford. He leads the Pac-12 in 3-pointers (71), and four Bruins, including Alford, shoot better than 43 percent from beyond the arc. There aren’t many all-around threats like UCLA freshman T.J. Leaf, who is second in the Pac-12 in 3-point percentage. The 6-foot-10 big man plays similarly to USC’s own, sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright. Leaf rebounds, passes and scores, averaging 16.7 points, 3.2 assists and 8.7 rebounds on the season. 
USC’s defense faces a tall order in slowing Leaf and company, especially without Boatwright and potentially redshirt senior forward Charles Buggs, who sat out Sunday night with a sore left knee. The Trojans will probably spend much of the game in their zone defense to solve the tricky individual
matchups UCLA poses. 
“We’re doing a good job defensively this year,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We’ve been inconsistent this year, but we play hard. We block shots. We steal the ball. We play small. We play big. We’ve got a special group here.”
Boatwright was originally expected to miss 6-8 weeks after injuring his knee against San Diego in November, but eight weeks later, he continues to sit. The coaching staff expects him to return to full practice soon — hopefully within a week or two.
“Our coaching staff is thrilled to be 17-4 without Bennie,” Enfield said. “The 327th most experienced team in the country has played beyond its years.”
