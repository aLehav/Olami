As California confronts one of its worst droughts on record, students in the Environmental Student Assembly announced the launch of a new certification program on Tuesday. The program will provide organizers with a guide on how to make on-campus events environmentally friendly.
ESA Executive Director Shawn Rhoads says that the certification program is a major step in making USC a leader in sustainability.
“We don’t want to ‘be like’ some other university, we want to set the standard,” Rhoads said.
On-campus groups, student organizations and university departments are all eligible to use the certification program as a guide and resource for environmentally friendly event planning.
If an organization uses the program, ESA’s executive board approves a checklist of environmental goals for a planned event and rates the event based on seven categories: general practices, food and food services, communications and marketing, promotional items, transportation, production and a miscellaneous category for other innovative green practices.
Within the category of food and food services requirements for the certification range from vegan and vegetarian options to a prohibition on styrofoam products for food. Transportation requirements include the use of either public transportation or electric, Zipcar or hybrid vehicles.
Based on the percentage of the checklist met overall, the event receives a certification of “Cardinal,” “Gold” or “Green.” Green is the highest certification an event can achieve, with 67 percent or more of the applicable checklist practices met.
“I want this to serve as encouragement for students. I want students to go to an event and ask, ‘Is this ESA-certified?’” Rhoads said.
ESA moved to reform events after the 2014 Welcome Back concert that took place Aug. 23 on McCarthy Quad. Ralphs Grocery Company promoted the event and gave students plastic bags with food and grocery items. After the event, many bags were left on the quad.
“Not only were these bags left on the quad, but all the food and all the bags were wasted,” Rhoads said.
Rhoads hopes that the certification program will eventually be adopted into official university policy. The program is the next stage of ESA’s mission to create a “green culture” on USC’s campus.
“Program Board committees and assemblies, including Concerts Committee, recognize this issue on campus and have expressed interest to focus [their] efforts to use our program as a resource for their events,” Rhoads said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
On Tuesday, ESA members and supporters met at the “Fall in with ESA” event at Hahn Plaza. The event, which featured bicycle-churned ice cream from Peddler’s Creamery, informed students about new initiatives and ways to promote sustainability.
Ashley Louie, graphics director for ESA, said that she joined the organization because it combined an issue she cared about with her professional ambitions in architecture.
“In the field of architecture, it’s not just about creating a sustainable building, but determining how much energy it takes to maintain a building,” Louie said. “Things like natural lighting and solar panels are important.”
ESA began in spring 2014 as a representative assembly for all environmental organizations at USC and has since grown from its initial group of five member organizations to nine. Rhoads, who was elected as the organization’s first executive director last spring, said identifying sustainability issues on campus is a critical part of ESA’s mission.
“I think that since USC is a global leader, it should take more responsibility for its own community,” Rhoads said.
Among these issues is USC’s use of a single-stream recycling service that combines plastic and paper recyclable waste. This limits the amount of waste that can actually be reused due to the contamination from soiled items.
ESA also wants to raise awareness about companies such as Freeport-McMoRan drilling using hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” on Jefferson Boulevard. Environmental activists are concerned that the chemicals used to break up rock underground can taint groundwater supplies and be hazardous to residents.
Water conservation is another issue. Currently, USC’s Facility Management Services charges fees to turn off fountains and sprinklers for events. Instead, ESA believes the university should incentivize water conservation.
“We’re in the middle of a drought; why aren’t we conserving water?” Rhoads asked.
In spite of these issues, some students think the university is improving its sustainability. Supporters have pointed to examples such as efforts to eliminate waste on football game days.
ESA hopes to raise its profile even more this semester. Members said that the event certification program is only the beginning.
“Sustainability is a huge issue, and our campus certainly needs to work on it,” said Kelly Billings, a junior majoring in environmental studies.

USC was ranked 25th in the 2015 U.S. News & World Report’s list of “Best Colleges” released Tuesday, down two spots from the 23rd position last year.
The university’s tied with Carnegie Mellon University, while crosstown rival UCLA and the University of Virigina remained tied in the same position from the 2014 report at 23rd.
Katharine Harrington, the USC vice president of admission and planning, noted that the drop shouldn’t have any sort of impact on university admissions for next year.
“We see shifts in U.S. News rankings of one or two places not unusual at all,” she said. “It’s a small enough change that [admission decisions] are unlikely to be negatively impacted.”
The yearly report ranks schools based on an annual survey gathering data on up to seven indicators, including undergraduate academic reputation, student selectivity and faculty resources. U.S. News then weighs each of these factors subjectively in terms of importance and compiles a final weighted composite score to be compared alongside other schools.
Nearly 1,400 schools were ranked in this year’s edition, with 91.5 percent returning statistical information requested by U.S. News. In a change from past years, the report now contains campus crime statistics and a school’s three-year federal loan default rate, though the publication stated these additions are not factored into the ranking methodology.
“U.S. News has published these statistics to help parents and prospective students gather more information as they evaluate schools,” the U.S. News website stated.
Harrington also suggested there may have been some tinkering with the methodology this year as ties from the previous lists were broken up this year, such as the 2014 five-way tie at 23rd between Carnegie Mellon, USC, UCLA, the University of Virginia and Wake Forest University.
The magazine has stated on their website, however, that there has been no change to their methodology for the 2015 edition. Robert Morse, chief data strategist at U.S. News, told the Daily Trojan in an email that USC’s drop was attributed to three main factors. 
“USC fell because its data relative to the other schools it [sic] was very slightly weaker in academic reputation, graduation and retention, and HS counselor ranking,” Morse wrote. “USC’s change in rank was very small since last year there was a big tie of 5 schools at rank # 23 and those schools became untied as a result of very small changes in their data.”
Students on campus have expressed some dismay with the ranking slip.
“I wouldn’t want us to drop any more,” said Amanda Fear, a senior majoring in accounting. “It’s nice to still be in the top 25, though — I hope we can move back up.”
Himmat Singh, a sophomore majoring in biology, mentioned that the rank shift could possibly have a negative impact on an incoming student’s decision.
“If a student gets into USC and [also] a school that’s ranked higher than USC — even if USC might be a better choice for that student — they might end up going to the other school just because it’s ranked higher,” Singh said.
Though it is a common fear that a lower ranking may have a negative effect on admissions, a survey from UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute indicated that only 17.6 percent of incoming fall 2013 freshman considered “rankings in national magazines” to be very important. On the other end of the spectrum, 64 percent considered “a very good academic reputation” to be very important.
U.S. News considers their ranking an “excellent starting point” for students exploring colleges, rather than the be-all and end-all. In line with this, Harrington stressed that rankings alone cannot serve as proper indicator of where a student will best fit.
“Honestly, there is no ranking that can really adequately capture what the undergraduate experience is at any college or university,” she said.
 
 
I always look at the rankings of USC for fun, and as an alumnus, I would like to see USC higher than UCLA or Cal.  I have a Ph.D. from Cal and I attended UCLA for fun when I was at USC as an undergraduate.  The U.S. News and World Report survey is a ranking for undergraduate education, and I find it bothersome as a university instructor that UCLA and Cal seem to always receive a higher rank than USC, yet the class sizes at UCLA and Cal are much larger than at USC.  Although the professors at UCLA and Cal are more distinguished, fame and status does not translate directly into teaching quality.  Classes taught by Graduate Student Instructors at UCLA and Cal cannot provide the same level of quality as a private university course taught by a professor.  It is not fair to criticize undergraduate education based on the fact that USC professors are not at the same status as professors at a school like UCLA.  Look at Notre Dame.  Do you think Notre Dame professors have more status in their fields than UCLA or Cal professors?  They do not, yet Notre Dame is ranked higher than UCLA and Cal.  I would hope that USC would do a better job convincing the world that the undergraduate education at USC was better than it is perceived.  Academic reputation is not important if it is based on Ph.D. programs, such as at UCLA and Cal.  USC has been under-rated for many years.
Unfortunately, it’s human nature to take things at face value i.e. rankings, who’s got more distinguished faculty, etc. Nobody really slows down to delve past the images i.e. the fact that UC schools got 400+ students in their lectures with TAs, that shouldn’t even be teaching at a jr. college, leading the lectures.
SC will always be the “football” school, and the UCs…”public Ivies.”
So true that Marshall is a bad joke.  If you get the right accounting professors in the first accounting classes and do well in those classes and major in accounting and graduate with at least a 3.5, you will definitely find work as an accountant.  Otherwise, forget it.  The business world has no respect for USC Marshall, the Trojan network is a myth, and after graduation from Marshall you will be lucky to get a $10 an hour job as an office clerk.  Of course no one at Marshall prepares students for the nightmare they will face when they graduate and try to find work.  They ought to close all of Marshall except the accounting part and tell the non-accounting students to go major in engineering, computer science, a non-English language, or economics so that they might actually find work in their fields someday.
I agree with you. But, let me give you a little more insight into what I’ve learned from speaking with an alumna from a different b-school. A couple years ago I came across this girl, who went to UC Berkeley Haas as an undergrad. She also told me things didn’t look promising although she diligently exhausted her efforts via interns, rounds of interviews, submitting resumes, networking, etc. After working a few years in inauspicious jobs as accounting-temps, clerical work, and so forth…she gave up and pursued a post-bac med-school thing. It seems that med-school is the only promising academic area. But we all know it’s very difficult and competitive, making business or other non-STEM academic areas look like a joke. Anyways, the gist was, Haas is ranked much higher than Marshall…but Haas alumni don’t really fare better than Marshall’s. The Bay areas is not the Northeast *hint Ivy League b-schools got more prestige*
My second point is that Marshall needs to drastically reduce the capacity for Marshall. Haas is about 700 students (undergrad) whereas Marshall (including Leventhal) is like 3,600. No need for the over saturation of this. Haas’ much smaller number also contributes to its more exclusive admissions; people don’t know this, at least not outsiders. So yeah, USC needs to stop cranking out Marshall or accounting majors. It’s ridiculous! It’s a degree mill. And yes, you’re right…It gets no respect in the b-school rankings. SC Marshall needs to emulate Haas wrt student-capacity and U-Penn Wharton. U-Penn is located in the Northeast i.e. Wall Street. An SC alumnus ain’t gonna beat out a Wharton grad, no way! Banking, analysts, options trading, etc. are all old-boy connected with the strings being pulled by Ivy alumni; ditto with white-shoe law firms.
Pssst, let me give you some hints as to why Ucla or Cal will most of the time, if not always, beat USC in these academic rankings. First of all, I am a Trojan. But I do look at things with objectivity. Second, my girlfriend, who attended Ucla as an undergrad, went here for grad school. What she criticized USC for, was that she felt SC didn’t have distinguished faculty. She wasn’t too impressed with her instructors’ alma maters, background, research, et al. and thought  they weren’t as impressive as Ucla’s faculty. Sooooo, the “peer review” criterion in these rankings I think has to do with what was just mentioned. Lastly, SC needs to cut down on the academic departments that are over saturated e.g. the business school…and other stuff in which you generate myriad grads who become disgruntled and disillusioned after discovering that that area isn’t too auspicious in the job market. As a Marshall grad, I still keep in touch with a few alumni. But they too, aren’t too happy with what they’ve experienced five years out. So yeah, I think it’d behoove USC to cull a more distinguished faculty; cut down on the over saturated academic areas; do better wrt security (the recent murders over the past 2 years); and so forth. Then, maaaaaybe, USC can indelibly plant a spot in the teens of these academic rankings, rather than tenuously teetering back and forth, losing to Ucla here and there.
But let’s keep our focus on other important things: Let’s kick ass in football. I’m very pleased with what I’m seeing so far.
Fight on!

The Asian Pacific American Student Assembly announced plans for a month-long voter registration campaign at Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government meeting. The campaign will take place from September to Oct. 17 and focus on political empowerment within the Asian Pacific American community at USC.
Working together · USG holds their weekly meeting Tuesday night which featured a presentation by APASA to launch new voting initiatives. – Carol Kim | Daily Trojan
APASA Executive Director Kaylee Ho planned and organized the campaign.
“Asian Americans are known for our lack of political participation. We wanted to show our constituents why voting matters,” Ho said.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Ho said that Asian American political apathy is often blamed on preoccupation with socioeconomic status, as well as a preference for Asian politics rather than American politics. However, she said there is evidence suggesting these assumptions are incorrect.
Ho cited an April 20 article in Diverse Magazine, which found that Asian Americans vote at similar rates to the general population once they are registered. The article also suggests that few organizations make the initial effort to mobilize and register the Asian American community.
To counteract this trend, APASA applied for and received a $1,000 grant from the Los Angeles branch of Asian Americans Advancing Justice to conduct their voter awareness campaign.
APASA is hosting the campaign in collaboration with two of its member organizations, the Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment and Troy Philippines.
The campaign will be on National Voter Registration day, Sept. 23, at Tommy Trojan. A social media campaign will also take place.
Ho said that one of the main challenges in the campaign is addressing myths associated with voting in the Asian community.
“A lot of [Asian Americans] don’t register to vote because they want to avoid jury duty,” Ho said.
Ho says that in many states, jury pools are drawn from income tax returns and DMV registration rather than voting registration. APASA hopes to counter the effects of such beliefs with its voter awareness campaign.
APASA Assistant Director Sean Zhong said that the campaign is designed to fight unfamiliarity with voting regulations and empower the Asian American community.
“Asian Americans aren’t aware of their own political power,” Sean Zhong said. “On the political stage, we can be downplayed a bit.”
APASA represents students from the Asian Pacific American community, a category that includes 45 distinct ethnic groups who speak over 100 dialects.
“We’re extremely diverse, and it’s really hard to get everyone together to fight for the same cause,” Ho said.
She suggests the diversity of Asian Americans can be better acknowledged and accommodated if Asian Americans are politically empowered.
“[All Student Count Act] just shows statistics about Asian Americans not, for example, Chinese Americans,” Ho said. “We’re all lumped into the same group of people, and it’s something we’re trying to change.”

The USC a capella community boasts USC’s finest singers making up eight a capella groups.  This eclectic community provides singers the opportunity to join their voices and communicate to the larger community. At the start of each semester, the a capella community hosts auditions for singers interested in joining a group.
Sing it! · UnderScore provides many opportunities to bond, including fun outings for delicous Jamba Juice Smoothies. The group makes it one of their biggest priorties to get as close as possible so that they can smoothy work together and accomplish their goals. — Photo Courtesy of UnderSCore
Despite the camaraderie that a capella groups can create, auditions create a competitive environment; the quantity and quality of singers is overwhelming. More often than not, each a capella groups turn down talented singers due to the limited space. Even the best singers may leave a capella auditions disheartened and disappointed. Junior theater major Coral Palmon was one of these singers, but she put her emotions behind her and created the newest addition to the a capella scene: UnderSCore. Created last spring, UnderSCore allowed Palmon to create an a capella group that suited her interests and filled a niche in the larger a capella community.
UnderSCore offers singers a unique and gratifying experience that is remarkably different from already established a capella groups.
“I knew a niche needed to be filled (in the a capella community),” Palmon said. “UnderSCore strives for vocal excellence and participates in community outreach.”
The community outreach Palmon refers to is volunteering at local schools to help children flourish creatively and personally.
“We volunteer at local schools to foster kids’ creativity, confidence and spontaneity because we believe these qualities are all important, especially when kids are developing,” Palmon said.
Community outreach, however, is just one of the many ways that UnderSCore distinguishes itself from other a capella groups.
UnderSCore is the first USC a capella group to have a theater-based repertoire. Palmon began singing at the age of 6 old and participated in musical theatre every year before she started at USC.
“Our repertoire has more musical theatre and Disney songs than the average a capella group, but it’s definitely a mix,” Palmon said. Clearly, UnderSCore performs songs that aren’t from musicals. Though the group deviates from performing songs from musical theatre, it doesn’t lose touch with its theatrical roots. For example, the name UnderSCore refers to the underlying musical background in theatrical productions. But UnderSCore’s name and identity stretch much further.
Palmon notes that singers in UnderSCore are able to poke fun at each other while still working hard at rehearsals. Group bonding occurs at rehearsals, and UnderSCore makes a point to provide its members more opportunities to bond with one another. The retreat the group has planed is something that Palmon is really excited about and will be an amazing experience for new members of the group. Members of the group also identify with one another through their love for the Trojan family. Palmon mentioned that the name UnderSCore makes a reference to USC’s frequently used abbreviation of SC. In this way, the name of the group effectively and appropriately creates unity throughout the group.
UnderSCore made its official debut last semester during one of Ground Zero’s open mic nights. For that to happen, — get to know eachother Palmon held auditions for potential members and found four singers who share her passions.
“I felt like there were other people passionate about the same things, and I found them,” Palmon said. Leading up to the performance at Ground Zero, Palmon worked with her five-person group to establish UnderSCore as a legitimate member of the a capella community. UnderSCore gained eight additional members at a capella auditions last spring. This week marks UnderSCore’s participation in a capella auditions for the second time in the group’s history.
“So many people are coming out to audition. It’s pretty fun, and we’re getting a lot of talent,” Palmon said.
Palmon also said the group developed strategies to get past internal group conflict over which singers to call back.
“There are always bound to be mild disagreements. It’s natural. But we talk it through, and if our members don’t agree, then we drop the conflict,” she said. “We always make sure that we stay respectful of each other’s opinions.”
During auditions this week, UnderSCore looked for capable singers of all backgrounds who have an interest in the community.
“If you like singing and you like kids, it’d be more than a great fit for you,” Palmon said. “There’s not a specific type of person we’re looking for,” she said.
Overall, Palmon described auditions are “overwhelming in an awesome way.”
As for what’s next for UnderSCore, Palmon says they hope to become more integrated in the USC a capella community,  and hope to reach out to more schools in the community and participate in a capella competitions.  UnderSCore will continue to grow this semester and provide more opportunities for students to broadcast their talents to the community.

The concept of Women is simple — the stage show attempts to fuse Louisa May Alcott’s beloved Little Women and Lena Dunham’s infamous HBO series Girls. Put them together and we have Women, a play set in the 1800s replete with Victorian-esque leather lace-up boots and frilly, long sleeve blouses, featuring a female cast that speaks in modern, casual language that is peppered with slang and repetition of phrases like “um, like.”
Written by Chiara Atik, directed by Stephanie Ward and performed by a female-heavy ensemble, In a similar fashion to Dunham’s series, Women is notable for its sheer amount of female presence on, and off, the stage. Women offers a refreshing alternative to the male-dominated entertainment we see today. A Hollywood Fringe Festival darling with the potential to positively impact the role of women in entertainment, Women sure had a lot to live up to, but it unfortunately fell slightly flat.
For those of you unfamiliar with Little Women, it can be summed up as follows: Four sisters live in the quiet New England countryside with their mother while their father is off to war. The family is very poor, which limits their ability to travel or own multiple dresses. (Women references this by having one of its characters complain: “Do you know Sally Moffatt has like six dresses? It’s insane.”). Of course, there are many more nuanced elements within the novel, but the play uses that basic premise as a jumping-off point. From there we meet Jo March (Lauren Flans), who is the outspoken writer of the four sisters and fills the slot for Dunham’s Hannah Horvath character on Girls. At one point she climbs into a bath, strips naked and displays her arm tattoo –— all of which is very much an ode to Hannah’s trademark brazen exposition.
The other sisters, however, do not measure up to their counterpart Girls characters. There’s Amy (Jacquie Walters) who attempts to speak in a British accent in hopes of fulfilling the role of Jessa. Then there’s Meg (Erika Rankin), the Marnie of the women, who states early on, “I’ve met like two guys so far in my life.” And finally, Beth (Brigitte Valdez), who speaks at a million miles a minute with a topknot on her head, attempting to channel Shoshanna. In true Little Women form (and as the play stylizes on the back of the playbill) we watch as #BethDies — which provides the only true conflict in the play.
The attempt at depicting the characters from both Girls and Little Women simultaneously is very admirable, but not entirely successful. For instance, the Jo in the play is a lesbian who rejects the advances of neighbor Laurie (played by a very good Clayton Farris) because, as she states in the play, she “isn’t interested in men.” At the end of the play  however, she reconnects with her friend Professor Bhaer (Ben Moroski) for a compatible yet “entirely sexless” relationship. Not only is this unfaithful to the plot of Little Women (in it, Jo finds both a romantic and sexual relationship with Bhaer), it also doesn’t align itself with Girls’ extremely male-dependent Horvath. It seems the choice was to be played for laughs — some of which it got — and not for its loyalty to either of the original texts, which is pretty much how the entire show went. Meg doesn’t seem to be an accurate portrayal of Marnie, either. Instead, she comes off as more of a composite of stereotypes the playwright found in Girls rather than Marnie herself.
The show in its entirety is 55 minutes long, which is arguably twice as long as it should be. Had the characterizations been a bit more specific, it could have been more enjoyable to watch. Of course, not everything was bad. The use of John Williams’ original score from the Little Women film justaposes nicely with cues of Beyonce’s “Run the World (Girls)” track. Additionally, Valdez’s cheery yet constantly coughing Beth is a highlight of the play, and though Meg wasn’t an accurate reconstruction of Marnie, Erika Rankin did a very good job as the frustrated, stay-at-home sister of the group. All in all, if you want an airy, somewhat funny but too-long pop culture joke to occupy an hour of your time in a tiny theater smack dab in the middle of Hollywood, then Women is right for you.

USC Athletic Director Pat Haden left the press box during the third quarter of last Saturday’s 13-10 win over Stanford’s to personally challenge a refereeing decision. Haden, who is a member of the  College Football Playoff Selection Committee, explained that head coach Steve Sarkisian had requested his presence after Sarkisian no longer felt comfortable arguing an earlier sideline warning. Haden was criticized for his decision to head to the sideline, and on Monday received a $25,000 fine from Pac-12 conference officials.
One fine day · USC Athletic Director Pat Haden was fined $25,000 by the Pac-12 for confronting game officials on the sideline at Stanford. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Daily Trojan sports editors Aubrey Kragen and Will Hanley discussed Haden’s decision, his punishment and the role of active athletic directors in the new selection committee.
 
Q: Do you agree with Haden’s decision to respond to his coach’s request and head down to the field?
AK: I definitely do. Athletic directors, university presidents and miscellaneous celebrities roam the sidelines at games quite often, so I can understand Haden deciding to head down. It was a huge game for the Trojans, so why wouldn’t he come when he heard that his head coach needed help? The officiating in that game was already questionable, so after Sarkisian had already been dealt an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, Haden stepped in like an overprotective mother. It happens.
WH: I do, and I don’t. You have to remember, Haden’s a football guy at heart. More than that, as Sarkisian explained after the game, he’s a Trojan. Of course he was going to go help out his head coach in the tensest moment of maybe the most important game of the year. Sarkisian had a job to do and wasting his time arguing with officials while he should be focused on the task at hand would have been a huge mistake. Plus, because of his earlier sideline warning, Sark was risking a possible ejection. If the Trojans had to play that last quarter without their captain and their head coach, things might have turned out differently.
Still, Haden could have gone about it better. I completely understand the running, the screaming and the arm waving, but a guy as experienced as Haden should have known better. Not only was his demonstration perfect highlight material for a tired, underpaid associate producer at ESPN, but it reignited a seemingly dormant debate about his role on the NCAA selection committee. By calmly walking down to the field and quietly engaging an official, he could have avoided a lot of this mess.
 
Q: Was the Pac-12 right to fine Haden? Should he face any other punishment?
AK: I’m not sure I agree with the $25,000 fine. Media reports of his “confrontation” with the officials are really exaggerated, and I don’t see anything wrong with him arguing a call. I do understand, though, the Pac-12’s desire to take a stand on the issue.
WH: Yeah, the conference probably did the right thing here. The fine sets a good precedent, even if it was borne out of one of the more bizarre events I’ve ever witnessed. I can’t imagine the NCAA levying any further punishment on Haden; he’s accepted the Pac-12’s punishment and even picked up some public goodwill by negotiating with the conference to have the fine donated to charity. The NCAA has felt some heat for revoking Penn State’s sanctions, and I doubt strengthening its apparent vendetta against USC by punishing Haden would look all that great. As far as the selection committee goes, he’ll stay on. The head of the committee is voicing his outright support for Haden, and I doubt the committee wants to make such a significant change this late in the game.
 
Q: Overall, how well do you think Haden, Sarkisian and the Athletic Department handled the aftermath of the situation?
AK: I think Sarkisian came out of this looking a little sheepish. Calling Haden down in the first place looks, in retrospect, like a kid having someone bigger fight his battles for him. But he and Haden have apologized, and I’m sure people will forget about this by Sunday morning.
WH: Haden is actually coming out of this looking pretty good. He and the Athletic Department have spun this into a simple case of a passionate AD coming to his coach’s aid in a crucial situation. Plus, that $25,000 kick to charity won’t hurt. The guy who took the real hit in this situation was Sarkisian. First, he got hit with a sideline warning in an incredibly important game, then compounded that warning by arguing about it. He had good motives at heart when he asked Haden to come down and deal with the situation while he coached the game, but Sark definitely had other options. In the end, this won’t be a big problem for either guy. Haden will be fine, and Sark was open and apologetic enough that this will all blow over.
 
Q: Should current ADs be permitted to vote on the selection committee?
AK: If coaches get a vote in the Coaches Poll each week, why shouldn’t athletic directors be able to serve on the college football playoff selection committee? Haden arguing a call on the sidelines does not that mean that he is incapable of making an unbiased decision when it comes to the playoff teams. Six of the 13 members of the committee are or were athletic directors at some point, and I’m sure the founders of the committee thought long and hard about allowing them on. Each member of that committee will have a slight bias, toward his or her alma mater at least. But they all must do their best to suppress that when it comes time to make the big decisions.
WH: Yes, for now at least. The current makeup of the committee is balanced enough for at least a trial run. The recusal policy, which forces any active AD to leave the room while his or her team is being considered, is a no-brainer, but I’m not sure if it’s enough. Athletic directors could still favor their own conference in negotiations. Even worse, they could hypothetically vote for teams that they feel are a better matchup for their own school. I’m not convinced this will happen. In fact, I really doubt it. Still, if any evidence of this type of tampering comes up there will be no doubt that this was a failed experiment.

The USC men’s golf team started its season on a strong note by placing second after three rounds of the season-opening Southwestern Intercollegiate tournament at the North Ranch C.C. in Westlake Village, California. The Trojans jumped up to second place on Tuesday after finishing in third on Monday.

After eight consecutive trips to the NCAA Championships, the Trojans combined for a two-round 8-over 580 after Monday, leaving them only eight strokes behind first-place Stanford and two strokes behind second-place Washington State. San Diego State and Pepperdine rounded out the top five, respectively.
Other competitors at the tournament included Arizona, Loyola Marymount, San Diego, UC Davis, Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Northridge and Hartford.
By the end of Tuesday, the Trojans had improved their placement and finished at 11-over 863, jumping Washington State in the placement. Perennial powerhouse Stanford remained in first place and won the tournament with a 4-under 848.
“Stanford looks to be solid once again,” said head coach Chris Zambri. “We’ll need more great play from everyone in the lineup if we are to beat them the next time we see them.”
The USC team was led by freshman Sean Crocker who, in making his collegiate debut, shot a 54-hole 5-under 208, which was enough to tie him for second overall in the event.
“Although we don’t like finishing second, there were a lot of positives this week,” Zambri said. “The play of Sean Crocker would be the first to mention. He put up three solid rounds for us.”
On his way to his second-place standing, Crocker shot seven birdies in his first round and finished the final ten holes of his second round at 2-under before shooting a 3-under in the final round of the tournament.
Crocker, who was born in Zimbabwe, comes to USC with a lot of experience under his belt, having competed in the California State Amateur each of the past two years.
His success at the course this week might be partially attributed to the fact that he moved to Westlake Village when he was young and attended high school there.
While Crocker placed second in the individual draw, 2014 All-American Rico Hoey began his sophomore campaign by tying for 16th at 6-over 219.
His first round of the tournament included three birdies and he followed up that performance by shooting four birdies the next round. Hoey looks to improve upon his freshman year when he had one of the most successful seasons in Trojan golf history. Hoey’s 71.36 was the best stroke average on the team. He also led USC in top 10 finishes (eight), rounds in the 60s (16), birdies (165) and eagles (eight).
His accomplishments earned him the 2014 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year award.
Crocker and Hoey were not alone on the leaderboard, as fellow Trojan freshman Jonah Texeira tied for 26th overall in his career debut. Texeira birdied 10 through 13 en route to a 1-under back 9 to close the night in the second round.
Senior Eric Sugimoto also had a strong showing at the tournament and finished tied for ninth by the end of the third round. He shot a final round 3-under 68 which vaulted him 17 spots in the rankings, prompting his coach to praise his efforts.
“Eric Sugimoto played a nice final round and showed that this year could be a big one for him,” Zambri said.
Next up for the Trojans is the Itani Homes Collegiate in Pullman, Washington from Sept. 29-30.

I’m an idiot.
OK, not exactly. But I certainly look like one if you go back and read this past Friday’s Daily Trojan.
Pumped up kicks · Senior kicker Andre Heidari went 2-for-2 USC’s win over Stanford on Saturday. Heidari has never missed a field goal against the Cardinal and has nailed the game winners the last two seasons. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
I was the only of five sportswriters to predict in the Best Bets table that USC would lose to Stanford. I was absolutely rooting for the Trojans to pull off the upset and exploded with the other couple thousand USC fans in Stanford Stadium as senior kicker Andre “The Lumberjack” Heidari’s 53-yard field goal attempt went through the uprights. But my attempt to be the smartest guy in the room last week backfired, and I may have to start picking against USC every week for good luck.
I stand by the thought process behind my prediction; USC obviously outscored Stanford, but I wouldn’t necessarily say the squad outplayed the Cardinal. Nonetheless, the Trojans proved that the media — myself included — very much underestimated how good this team is.
A look at the stat line and it’s easy to figure out why the score looked the way it did Saturday. Stanford had 413 yards to USC’s 291, 21 first downs to 16, eight penalties for 68 yards to 10 penalties for 87 yards and 33:47 time of possession to USC’s 26:13. But the one stat that matters most wasn’t in Stanford’s favor, as the Cardinal had two turnovers and USC had none.
The timing of the two turnovers, both fumbles, was huge. The first one came just after senior linebacker Hayes Pullard was ejected from the game for a targeting penalty on a big Stanford kick return. Just when it seemed like Stanford had grabbed all the momentum, the Cardinal gave it right back. The second one came on Stanford’s final drive at USC’s 25-yard line and sealed the win for the Trojans when a touchdown from Stanford would have stolen it.
The other big stat a little deeper in the box score illustrates another telling story: USC made both of its field goal attempts while Stanford missed two of three. Those six points left on the table would have been the difference with all else equal.
And that’s not even counting the field goal attempts Stanford passed up because of a lack of confidence in the team’s kicking game that day. The Cardinal punted from USC’s 29-yard line instead of attempting a 46-yarder on its second drive. Stanford went for it on fourth-and-1 on USC’s 3-yard line instead of kicking but got stopped on the sixth drive and punted from USC’s 32-yard line on the eighth drive instead of attempting a 49-yarder.
I’m not an accounting major, but I’ve got over two touchdowns’ worth of points left on the table by Stanford because of special teams. Maybe you chalk up the turnover on downs to a well-executed goal-line stand by USC instead of a bad play call. But a field goal attempt would have made sense there in such a close game, and Steve Sarkisian elected to kick when the Trojans had a fourth-and-1 from Stanford’s 7-yard line.
So with all of that considered, did USC win the game or did Stanford lose it? Do all those mistakes indicate that the Trojans are a better team than Stanford, or that USC just got lucky a bunch of times? There’s obviously a little bit of both, but the implication of where the balance lies is huge. I think there’s a very good chance USC and Stanford play again in the Pac-12 championship game, a victory which will almost certainly guarantee a spot in the four-team national championship playoff.
If you had told me before the game that USC was going to win because of its exponentially superior placekicking, I would have called you an idiot. I haven’t always had faith in Heidari, and I would have gone for it instead of kicking on both the fourth-and-1 from the 7-yard line and the fourth-and-5 from the 35-yard line. But me not knowing anything has been a consistent theme this column, and Sarkisian turned out to have made the right call in both situations without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. Heidari does love beating Stanford, but Stanford’s kicker Jordan Williamson went 18-for-22 last year, so I imagine he would play better in a rematch.
The fact that USC showed toughness when it mattered most, though, is something I should have seen coming. The team has been mentally tested with adversity early this season, all of last season and really all of the last four years since the NCAA sanctions. So it wasn’t surprising — though it was very impressive — to see how the team reacted to the Pullard ejection.
It looked like a very soft call from the stands — though replay and most commentary confirm it was a legitimate call given new targeting rules — and it would have been very easy for the team to let anger with the officials snowball given the loss of a senior captain for the rest of the game (and the first half of the next game), especially after the sideline flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct just before the snap. Instead, the team directed all that energy towards forcing a fumble on the next play, arguably the biggest moment of the entire game.
Whether Stanford’s problems were aberrations or indicative of endemic weakness in the program is yet to be seen. We’ll find out when the Cardinal plays Oregon and possibly in the conference title game.
But that conference title game is looking like a distinct possibility for USC. UCLA had another very underwhelming non-conference performance, and the Trojans are now the top-ranked team in the South division, though that race is far from over.
With how exciting this new rivalry has become, and with the Pac-12 championship game scheduled to be played in the San Francisco 49ers’ new Levi’s Stadium, I would love nothing more than a rematch for Weekender round two.

USC will put its 2-0 record on the line this weekend at Boston College and is spending the week preparing for the long roadtrip. The Trojans are focused on not allowing a letdown after the big Stanford game, which might be difficult without their star linebacker and possibly without their top defensive lineman.

Pulled Out
Redshirt senior inside linebacker and co-captain Hayes Pullard was ejected in the third quarter of USC’s game at Stanford last Saturday and will have to miss the first half of the Trojans’ game this weekend at Boston College as a result. Head coach Steve Sarkisian did not express any concern about Pullard’s absence, showing full confidence in sophomore inside linebacker Michael Hutchings.
“Michael will step right in, just as he did in [last Saturday’s] game,” Sarkisian said. “And he’ll start at that position next to [redshirt junior linebacker] Anthony Sarao.”
Sarkisian also mentioned true freshman linebacker Olajuwon Tucker as the second man the team is looking at to see significant playing time this Saturday in Pullard’s absence. Sarkisian admitted that this is the first time he has dealt with this type of situation and that he needs to clarify some of the specifics of the rules with the conference prior to the start of the game.
“I don’t know if he’s allowed to warm up and pre-game with us or not,” Sarkisian said. “I don’t know if he’s allowed to be on the sidelines or not … but whatever we can do and whatever Hayes can do we’ll do and have him ready to go for the second half.”
According to league rules, Pullard can warm up with the rest of his team before the game, but he must spend the first half of the game in the confines of the locker room.
Injury Update
While Pullard will definitely be  out for the first half of the game, junior defensive end Leonard Williams’ status is more up in the air.
The recently named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week sat out of practice on Tuesday. Williams sustained an ankle sprain in practice last week, but played through the injury over the weekend and recorded 11 total tackles and a sack. Sarkisian said sitting Williams Tuesday was mostly precautionary and expects him to return to practice later this week and play on Saturday.
The Trojans will also again be without redshirt junior running back Tre Madden, who is working through a turf toe injury, and senior linebacker Lamar Dawson, who is rehabbing his knee this week.
Freshman safety John Plattenburg strained his Achilles tendon, but Sarkisian says the injury is not serious.
On the Road Again
Following the Trojans’ game in Palo Alto this past weekend, the team now turns eastward as it prepares to travel to Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.
The team insists that its preparatory routine remains the same regardless of the location of their game.
“We are going to keep the same mindset and the same focus,” redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler said. “You can’t let factors like where you’re playing or when you’re playing affect how you play.”
There is a stigma about back-to-back road games, but Kessler remains unfazed.
“We could travel out of the country and these guys are still going to show up,” Kessler said. “It doesn’t really matter where you play. It’s the opponent, not where we are playing.”
The Trojans faced their first road test amid a vocal Stanford crowd, and the players are anticipating nothing less coming from Boston College.
Freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith is looking forward to his second road game ever.
“I’m pretty sure it’s going to be a big game out there,” Smith said. “It’s going to be really loud and be really fun.”
Though Smith appeared excited to head to Boston, Sarkisian insisted that he won’t let his team get wrapped up in the lore of the city.
“They can go on a vacation later,” Sarkisian said. “This is a business trip.”

Few understand the overall impact a service dog has on a person with physical disabilities. Some service dogs have the ability to sense when a seizure is coming for their owners, while others can help their blind owners cross the street safely. It is appalling when some businesses refuse to acknowledge such animals, and worse, the people that need these animals for daily use.
This was the case for 24-year-old Amy Kaplan of Brighton, New York last week when Starbucks turned her away because of the presence of her service dog. According to NBC News, Kaplan suffered a tragic brain injury in a car accident that left her with memory issues and anxiety, and, according to USA Today, she suffers from a severe form of bipolar disorder. Her dog helps her manage these issues, so her need for it in a crowded place like Starbucks is critical.
As seen on the YouTube video that Kaplan posted of the encounter, a Starbucks employee told her that she could not “come in with [her] service dog” and that he could “see no proof that that’s a service dog,” to which Kaplan had to attempt to justify her dog’s presence in the store by referring to the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a business is only permitted to ask a customer if his or her animal is a service animal and what service it has been trained to perform. Its placement in society is to prohibit “discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodation, communications, and governmental activities,” according to the United States Department of Labor. The Starbucks incident with Kaplan seems to be in direct violation of the “public accommodation” aspect of this law, which is disturbing.
This isn’t the first time Starbucks is making headlines with this issue, however. Just last February, U.S. Army veteran Yancy Baer was told he could not enter a Texas store because of his service dog, Verbena, who he’d gotten after a leg amputation due to bone cancer in 2009. Baer, in an interview with Fox News, recalled that after he had stated that Verbena was a service dog, the employee said blankly, “You’re not blind.” This case, and Kaplan’s, both happened at Starbucks, but the repeat seems to point to an issue of ignorance on a larger scale.
Though there are some cases in which people have abused the use of service dogs, the need for sensitivity in such cases is still a priority for many people in need of service animals. Though there is not a specific solution to this problem, considering that no one can legally ask for a service animal’s documentation, educating people on the importance of respecting the business of service animals seems to be the most prudent policy.
In response to the actions taken against Kaplan, the regional vice president for Starbucks tried to call and email her an apology, according to the Democrat & Chronicle. Kaplan felt that the gesture was appropriate, but that Starbucks needs to better train its employees with regard to handling customers with service animals. Employees should be willing to accept the answer “this is a service dog” from a customer if asked about his or her animal, and they should not further question the customer. Even if the customer turns out to be using the explanation disingenuously, it’s better to let someone slip through the cracks once than to deny a customer his or her guaranteed rights.

The ‘its a service dog’ excuse has been massively abused,which unfortunately has ruined it for people with a legitimate need. I work at a popular entertainment location and on a daily basis see people who I suspect are simply saying it so their dog can stay with them all day. I saw a teacup yorkie claiming to be a service dog once. Often it is apparent the dog is not a service animal by its behavior. Service dogs are highly trained and know how to behave. Pseudo-service dogs frequently bark at other people and appear distracted by the excessive stimulation of a situation. Sad to say, it is sometimes necessary to question the legitimacy of the ‘service’ dog claim.

This summer, as the world watched the growth of police militarization in Ferguson, Missouri following the fatal shooting death of a teenager by a police officer, the school board in Compton, California passed a policy to allow campus police to carry assault rifles while on duty. The school board said it was responding to the prevalence of shooting sprees in the nation in recent years. Though it was intended to be a security measure, the Compton school board’s decision to address a larger social issue with more force will simply create more problems.
Andrea Wijaya | Daily Trojan
 
The policy allowing police to store semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifles in their patrol car trunks will go into effect as students head back to school this fall, according to the Washington Times. When the school board met in July to vote on this policy, its members reasoned that school officials needed firearms to properly protect students if a threat arose inside the school buildings.
The police force in the city defended the decision. Citing an FBI study, Compton Unified Police Chief William Wu said that roughly 5 percent of mass shooters have used similar firearms.
“This is our main objective — save lives, bottom line,” Wu told the school board.
Arming police with these heavy weapons around school children has the potential to cause more harm than help, however.
According to Pentagon data obtained and published by The New York Times, police departments have received tens of thousands of machine guns and accessories during President Barack Obama’s administration. Reports suggest that grants from Homeland Security allowed small towns to purchase tanks and other military equipment. Ferguson was one of those cities. A strong argument that came out of the Ferguson situation was that the small town police officers do not know proper safety etiquette when using their weapons. Several pictures documented Ferguson police officers with their guns drawn and aimed at civilians who had their hands raised.
Several gun companies, including Magtech Ammunition, recommend that “before you pick up or accept a gun from someone, make sure you know how it works” as a safety precaution.
Compton campus officers have been given proper training before receiving their weapons, according to The Atlantic.  The training, though, must be thorough to ensure officers know the proper steps in order to make a positive impact.
Additionally, access to assault rifles might cause distractions to the learning environment that the Compton school system is looking to create. The city has a long-held reputation as a place of danger and violence by the police and against violence both by and against the police. As a result, like many urban schools, the Compton school police are already situated inside the school to provide security for day-to-day happenings. Officers should not shift a large focus of their jobs to planning for possible worst-case scenarios. It should maintain focus on normal security concerns and address students in an approachable manner.
Compton’s school board is not the first one in California to authorize its police to carry firearms in a manner reminiscent of a war zone. School police in Los Angeles and San Diego are currently allowed to carry assault rifles in a limited capacity. These school systems, too, are headed in the wrong direction if they are truly committed to curbing violence in schools.
The local police union in Compton reasoned, “If we encounter an active mass murderer on campus with a rifle or body armor, our officers may not adequately be prepared to stop that suspect.”  But what if officers encounter a student that just looks like he or she has a deadly object? In such a case, what if they accidentally misuse their firearms?
The response to reach for more guns in this country when we feel the need for protection is flawed. Instead, we need to reach out to others and discuss the deficiencies in society and the reason why violence is so prevalent. Attacking the underlying problem of a culture of violence in the United States should not be done with more force. Yes, the normalization of campus shooters needs to be addressed. Law enforcement, school administration and the communities, however, should not just simply arm themselves. They must look at the root causes of the shootings that are occurring more frequently on campuses.
Since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 in which 26 children and teachers were killed in a mass shooting, there have been 10 instances of intentional mass shootings on school campuses, according to Politifact. Americans regularly hear about shootings in deemed “safe” places, such as schools, movie theaters and the workplace.
Drawing on past experience to make the future safer is a wise choice. Allowing school police the ability to draw weapons on perceived threats, however, is not the solution. In the face of danger, police militarization might seem like the way to go, but an honest conversation about the root issues of these shootings is what’s truly needed in school zones in California and throughout the nation.

If “no means no” becomes “yes means yes,” California could become the first state in the country to adopt a new affirmative consent standard for universities’ sexual assault and gender-based violence policies.
The California bill, penned by Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), passed unanimously through the state senate last month. If signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, it would require colleges receiving funding from the state to adopt an affirmative consent standard of “yes means yes,” in which only an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement uninhibited by silence, a lack of resistance or intoxication of any kind can be regarded as consent.
The law would also include policies and procedures detailing how to best handle cases of sexual assault or domestic violence on college campuses in order to ensure academic institutions provide the treatment, information and resources necessary to students.
Though the legislation is still pending, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said the university will abide by the law completely if passed.
“If it adds clarity for students to use the affirmative ‘yes,’ we welcome it, “ Carry said. “Every educational effort we can deploy adds clarity to the conversation.”
The bill is being considered amid a nationwide conversation regarding sexual assault on college campuses. At least 76 universities, including USC, UC Berkeley and UCLA, are currently under investigation by the Department of Education for alleged misconduct in handling sexual assault cases.
Undergraduate Student Government Assistant Director of Wellness Affairs Francesca Bessey said that though calling for affirmative consent is an important step, it also reflects the need to remove the responsibility from the victim to the offender.
“There are a lot of associated cultural and policy shifts in choosing the ‘yes means yes’ idea because what that shift really reflects is a transition from victim-oriented conversations to predator-orientated conversations, and shifting responsibility from the person who was supposed to say no to the person who was supposed to seek permission with a yes,” Bessey said.
USC Center for Women and Men Director Ekta Kumar said USC already incorporates affirmative consent language in its policies regarding sexual assault on campus.
“Generally, I think this bill is great, and it helps point universities in the right direction,” Kumar said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “USC, however, already utilizes this type of affirmative consent language in its procedures and policies.  If you look at SCampus policies, it is already in line with this bill and helps combat rape culture.”
Last month, the university implemented seven new provisions for sexual assault prevention designed to educate the campus community about sexual misconduct, including the implementation of initiatives such as mandatory online sexual assault education and a “Step-Up” program encouraging bystander intervention. Also included in the new provisions will be a campus-wide task force composed of student volunteers committed to coordinating university efforts to address issues of sexual assault.
Bessey said that though the national and on-campus conversations surrounding issues of sexual assault are to be applauded, the university must do more to seek enough input from students on how to handle it.
“It is my feeling that consent is not consent if it’s not being actively given,” Bessey said. “I wish that my university would have that same standard.”
Though no  single  piece of legislation will solve the issues surrounding sexual assault prevention on campus, Carry said the combined efforts of legislators, university administrators and students is a step in the right direction.
“Students are talking about it, students are aware of it — and that’s exactly what we want,” Carry said. “We want students to be aware of these things on Friday and Saturday nights when they’re making smarter choices.”
Carry also stressed the importance of maintaining the momentum surrounding nationwide conversations about sexual assaults on campus.
“What I don’t want is for us to have this big storm of excitement and then forget to talk about it,” Carry said. “I’m proud of the efforts in Sacramento and on our college campuses to keep the conversation going.”
Gov. Brown has until Sept. 30 to sign the bill.

ShakeAlert, an early warning earthquake program currently in operation at USC, was the topic of discussion during last weekend’s three-day Third International Conference on Earthquake Early Warning at UC Berkeley.
Among the attendees were earthquake experts from around the world and politicians who discussed the difference a few seconds make in terms of earthquake preparedness.
Already utilized by five universities, ShakeAlert typically gives a 10 to 30 second notice (or more time depending on location) before significant waves hit. ShakeAlert currently costs $15 million a year to operate and will require an additional $82 million to implement throughout the entire state over a period of five years.
Though ShakeAlert is still in its early stages of development, it successfully warned of the 6.0 magnitude, Aug. 24 Napa Valley earthquake 10 seconds before the ground began shaking.
According to post-doctoral researcher Robert Porritt of the Southern California Earthquake Center headquarted at USC, it is only the initial cost of ShakeAlert that is significantly high. After implementation, operational costs are relatively low.
“The startup cost is the biggest cost for the early years,” he said. “It’s going to be front-heavy to get out the sensors and the recording instruments. We have to get infrastructure in order to pipe that data back to the processing center.”
Other countries that had representatives presenting at the conference, including Japan and Mexico, have implemented a nationwide early warning system already. It is the viewpoint of USC as well as other universities, politicians and researchers that an early warning system ought to be also implemented for California statewide and perhaps even the entire west coast.
Peggy Hellweg of UC Berkeley’s Seismological Laboratory attended the conference and explained the attendees’s shared vision of implementing ShakeAlert.
“We all agree that ShakeAlert can work, and it can work throughout the state if we have the right equipment,” she said.
Hellweg said the $82 million is to be split into $23 million for infrastructure and installation and $59 million divided evenly annually for operational costs of subsequent years. Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill last year advocating a statewide earthquake early warning system. The bill states the Office of Emergency Services has until January 2016 to find funding. Questions remain, however, about the source of the funding.
“There was no conclusive answer to that question,” Hellweg said. “Everybody agrees that some of the money should come from several different governments. There should also come from private partners and other resources or fees.”
Porritt said the costs of maintaining the system would decline after the initial investment of public funds.
“Once [the infrastructure is] in place, the costs are relatively low,” he said. “You just need somebody to maintain the computer systems and get the alerts. We’re talking three to four peoples’ salaries per year. Once it’s in the ground and running, it’s going to be a very low cost. It’s just the initial cost that’s huge.”
Regarding fees, Porritt believes ShakeAlert can be a business opportunity for consultants. He believes insurance companies in particular may have incentive to have ShakeAlert since it could reduce the cost they have to pay out when earthquakes do happen.  He also believes ShakeAlert should be a public system with niches for private companies.
The summit also addressed the issue of how alerts would be communicated to companies and the general public. Jennifer Strauss, the external relations officer at UC Berkeley’s Seismological Laboratory, said there were various ways to keep the public informed about earthquake safety measures.
“There’s a whole range of possible ways this can work,” Strauss said. “We were talking with various people during the conference about the dissemination technologies. You can envision apps on the cellphone, Java apps on the computer, built-in alerts like Amber Alerts, weather radios or TV.”
Though there is still ongoing research into improving the program, the focus is now primarily on funding and distribution to companies and the general population.
Caolinn Mejza, a sophomore majoring in public relations,  said that despite the costs of implementation, ShakeAlert is a project worth pursuing.
“I think the cost to develop it seems large but in comparison to human lives and the damages a potentially big earthquake could cause it is definitely a necessary investment,” Mejza said. “It’s better to take precautions now when we haven’t had any major tragedies recently rather than regret not taking any after one.”

Walter Lee Williams, a former USC professor, pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of sexually assaulting at least seven underage boys while in the Philippines.
Williams, 65, taught for approximately 20 years at USC until he quit in 2011. He was placed on the FBI’s Most Wanted List in June 2013 and was arrested later that month. Prosecutors allege that Williams used the pretext of research to travel to the Philippines and make contact with his victims.
In exchange for Williams’ plea, prosecutors recommended a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, as well as fines paid to his seven victims.
Williams taught in USC’s General Education program and specialized in history, anthropology and gender studies. He was the recipient of a Fulbright Award and a USC General Education Outstanding Teacher Award in 2006.
The ex-professor reportedly made sexual advances toward two Filipino boys over a webcam in 2010, then traveled to the Philippines in 2011. During his time abroad, he assaulted the two boys, aged 14 and 13, and another victim who was 15.
During his time in the Philippines, Williams made contact with at least three other boys, the Los Angeles Times reports. Prosecutors speculate that Williams, who made several trips to the South Pacific during his career, had at least 10 victims.

Approximately 25 students along with alumni, professors and Los Angeles community members met with Executive Director of the League of Women Voters of Los Angeles Raquel Beltran as part of the first “Lunch with a Leader” event. The luncheon was hosted by the Sol Price School of Public Policy’s Judith and John Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Public Enterprise at the Widney Alumni House.

The Bedrosian Center hosts events that connect students with leaders in the community in order to educate students on the strengths and workings of governance, as well as policy and its effects on citizens.
The theme of the event was how to increase voter participation and the quality of votes cast.
At the beginning of the event, Raphael Bostic, director of the Bedrosian Center, posed two questions to the attendees: “Why do we see such little turnout in our elections?” and “What should we do about it?”
Responses varied from requiring voting by all citizens, having a raffle for every person who votes, informing people more effectively of when elections are, closing down all the business on Election Day and investing more time and energy into civic engagement.
“Voter turnout is the last step in the process,” said Terry Cooper, a professor at the Price school. “Civic engagement starts before that.”
The group brainstormed different ideas for several minutes.
“Let’s have public informational and neutral meetings in large public places, like libraries, to help inform people of elections and the process,” said Seema Yedavalli, assistant director for career services at Price.
Beltran, who has led the League of Women Voters of Los Angeles for six years, responded in opposition to the suggestion and opted for a different approach to the same idea.
“Find out what meetings are already taking place, and have an audience and leaders and ask if you could present your issues there,” Beltran said.
One of the issues is that the voting population of Los Angeles does not account for renters.
According to Beltran, two-thirds of Los Angeles’s population is made up of renters, but two-thirds of its voting population is composed of homeowners. She emphasized that citizen participation was necessary to address the diverse needs of Los Angeles residents.
“It’s nice to see the League is interested in getting broad participation [from] people who do not normally get involved,” said Erik Yesayan, an ’08 alumnus. “This is what inspires me to stay involved. I loved the idea that voting should be the last step and that a lot needs to get done before and after for more civic engagement.”
The event ended with Beltran encouraging students to get involved.
“I always say do something,” she said. “Do something. Find out where you’re comfortable and just get into it. If every single one of you does something at the level you can manage and something you’re comfortable with, that is a big change.”
