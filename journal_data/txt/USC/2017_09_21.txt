Will the real Trojans please stand up?
We’re three weeks into the 2017 season, and we know more or less as much about this USC team as we did heading into opening day. The Trojans kicked off their campaign with an unconvincing win over Western Michigan, rebounded with a statement victory against Stanford but then required two overtime periods to down a double-digit underdog Texas team.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold has thrown for more than 1,000 yards and seven touchdowns so far this season, but he has also been picked off six times — already two-thirds of his 2016 total. The two-headed rushing attack of junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Steven Carr, which shined against the Broncos and the Cardinal, was held to less than three yards per carry against the Longhorns. USC’s defense, though formidable, has appeared prone to the occasional big play, which nearly crushed the team last weekend when Texas marched down the field and took the lead with 45 seconds left to play.
The Trojans now hit the road for their first game away from the Coliseum this fall. They will face an undefeated Cal team surging with confidence from its Week 3 upset over Ole Miss — and new head coach Justin Wilcox will be eager to exact revenge on his former team (he was USC’s defensive coordinator under former head coach Steve Sarkisian). Though the Bears endured a brutal 2016 campaign, they picked up an opening-week win at North Carolina in addition to beating Ole Miss, and they could very well give the Trojans their biggest test of the year so far come Saturday.
But another battle of attrition could spell trouble for this banged-up USC squad, which can ill-afford more injuries — let alone a loss. A slew of key players have been on the sidelines during practice this week, including Jones, junior linebacker Porter Gustin and three other starters. Of course, the Trojans’ injury issues will only make their task more difficult against the hungry Bears.
Fortunately, USC can take heart looking back at last year’s matchup. Even if Wilcox’s presence is a massive boost to the defense, this is largely the same roster that allowed USC to torch them for 629 total yards on offense in 2016; Trojan runners bowled the Bears over for 398 yards while Darnold rang up five scores through the air. Granted, 163 of USC’s receiving yards came from JuJu Smith-Schuster and Darreus Rogers, but junior wideout Deontay Burnett, who has racked up more than 120 yards in four consecutive games dating back to the Rose Bowl, should still keep Cal’s defense very busy.
However, can Jones and Carr rebound from their tough night versus Texas? Will a potentially depleted receiving corps get open for Darnold?
Can Darnold himself avoid giving the ball away to a Cal defense that ranks third in the FBS in forced turnovers? There is still plenty of confidence in this program, especially after last week’s dramatic win, but the feeling of invincibility that made fans chant “We want ’Bama” last year is fading rapidly. Whether it’s due to unlucky bounces or lack of chemistry, USC hasn’t completely clicked yet this season, and paranoid fans are starting to see upsets looming around every corner.
But there still remains a feeling that — when push comes to shove — the Trojans will jump on Darnold’s back and pull through. There was no better example of it than last weekend (save for maybe the Rose Bowl). Darnold, despite his two picks on the game, came out firing with no fear and deadly efficiency with less than a minute on the clock and no timeouts. From the second USC went down, the Trojans’ quarterback was spectacular, showing off his mobility, pocket presence and unmatched improvisational ability.
Even with all Darnold’s ability, though, it’s impossible to expect that from him every week. If they keep trying their luck, the Trojans will eventually wind up on the losing end of one of these nail-biters, especially away from home. USC hasn’t seen a deficit it couldn’t overcome in a full calendar year. You wouldn’t expect that streak to come to an end against Cal, who the Trojans haven’t lost to since 2003, but you can be sure the Bears smell blood after USC’s close call against Texas. Depending on which version of the Trojans shows up at Memorial Stadium, we could be in for another heart-stopper.
This team has been more roller coaster than hype train so far this season, but I’m still all in. With all the playmaking talent USC has on either side of the ball, there’s no question there is championship quality on this roster — and right now, there doesn’t seem to be a more automatic player in football than Darnold in clutch situations. It wasn’t necessarily pretty, but the Trojans took care of the Longhorns last week. Now it’s time for the bear hunt.

After two come-from-behind wins this past weekend, the No. 10 women’s soccer team will start their Pac-12 season when they travel to Salt Lake City for Saturday’s matchup against No. 25 Utah.
Utah (5-2-1) will present a tough challenge for the Trojans in their Pac-12 opener having never lost at home this season — with four wins in four games — and outscoring their opponents 17-2 while in Salt Lake City. The Utes’ last game was last Friday against a Kansas team responsible for the Trojans’ only loss of the season, and they defeated the Jayhawks 2-1 at home. This result should be noted by the Trojans as even though Utah was outshot by Kansas 19-12, the Utes were more clinical in their finishing, which allowed them to collect all three points. 
Out of the Utes’ 12 shots, they were able to get more than half (7) on target, suggesting that they take smart shots that have high probabilities of testing the goalkeeper. The Trojans must prevent the Utes from occupying the dangerous space in and around the penalty box if they want to prevent them from taking high-percentage shots, leading to more dangerous goal-scoring opportunities.           
The Utes are led in scoring by the dual threat of junior forward Hailey Skolmoski and junior midfielder Paola van der Veen, who have scored 7 and 6 goals respectively in eight games this season. These two goal-scoring threats have contributed (goal or assist) to 15 of the 21 goals scored by Utah this season, a little over 70 percent. What makes these goal scoring exploits even more impressive is that both Skolmoski and van der Veen have hit the target around 60 percent of the time, making them even that much more dangerous to the USC backline.    
As opposed to last weekend’s opponents, who did not have any main goal-scoring threats that the Trojans could identify and mark, the Utes will force the Trojans’ back line to constantly note the positions of both Skolmoski and van der Veen to keep these threats to a minimum. This task will be led by both redshirt senior defender Dominique Randle and junior defender Ally Prisock, who as the senior leaders of the Trojans’ back line will have the responsibility of keeping the entire defense organized and focused on stopping the Utah attack.
On the other side of the field, the Trojans’ front line cannot afford another performance like last weekend. Utah has a very stout defense, which has only surrendered seven goals in eight games this season and 10 shots per game. Coming from behind against this Utah team will be difficult. To prevent a repeat of last weekend’s performances, the Trojans must take the initiative and start strong. This task will be led by leading goal scorer freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo, who has four goals in seven games this season, scored two goals this past Sunday at San Diego. The Trojan attack must come ready to play and produce if they want to leave Utah with all three points.     
This game will be a challenging test for the Trojans to start off their Pac-12 season. Utah is a solid team that shares many characteristics with the Trojans, with both outscoring and outshooting their opponents. The result of this matchup will be decided by whether or not the Trojans can get off to a fast start and break the Utes’ home-winning streak.

The No. 5 Trojans are off to a 3-0 start, but so far each game has been contested in the comfort of the Coliseum. Now, the Trojans embark on the road for the first time this season in a matchup against a burgeoning program in Cal. 
“There is a mentality that I think you have to take [into road games] to not let the outside distractions come in,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Whether that is a different stadium, different locker room, crowd noise, getting on an airplane and traveling —sometimes it’s the first time for some kids getting on a plane.”
As they head into Saturday’s matchup, USC has not lost to Cal since 2003 back when Aaron Rodgers was the Bears’ quarterback. The Trojans’ current winning streak is the longest in a century’s worth of games between the two California programs. While USC has dominated Cal for over a decade, the Bears now possess one aspect of the game they have not had in a long time: a solid defense under new head coach and former USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox.
“He’s an unbelievable, brilliant coach,” Helton said. “And an aggressive coach. We figure that he will continue that aggressiveness versus us. He’s done it in the last three games.” 
Cal entered this football season with one of the toughest schedules in the nation (the 13th hardest according to Bleacher Report). Combine that with an inexperienced offensive line, the loss of prolific quarterback Davis Webb to the NFL, and the hardships of breaking in a new head coach, and it looked like the Bears would be on a fast track toward the very bottom of the Pac-12. Yet in Week 4, Cal stands at 3-0, with strong victories over North Carolina and Ole Miss primarily because of an aggressive, revamped defense. 
Finding statistics to illustrate just how bad Cal was on that side of the ball last year is not a difficult task. The Bears’ unit was the worst in the conference, as they gave up the most points (42.6) and second most rushing yards (272) per game. 
However, this year, Cal seems to be infused with new energy. Against Ole Miss, it forced three interceptions and sacked budding gunslinger Shea Patterson five times. Experienced Cal defenders like senior linebackers Devante Downs (leads the team in tackles, sacks and interceptions) and Raymond Davison III (23 tackles and two sacks) look like they are finally playing in a system that suits their talents and strengths. One storyline to watch will be how much Wilcox is able to decode USC’s offense given his time on the coaching staff just two years ago.
“Justin [Wilcox] and I were together for two years,” Helton said. “So obviously he knows my personality and I know his.”
Combine Cal’s defensive turnaround with its still-potent offensive attack (they were first in Pac-12 yards per game in 2016) led by running back Patrick Laird, and the Bears could be a dangerous threat to USC, which is still working out kinks on both sides of the ball. 
After running backs junior Ronald Jones and freshman Stephen Carr looked dominant against Western Michigan and Stanford, they were stifled in last week’s Texas game. The two combined for just 75 yards, as USC struggled to stay ahead of the chains. The Trojans were 6-of-18 on third down and came up short on all three fourth down attempts, partially due to a litany of drops from the receiving corps. Without effective running, the offense turned to redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold relying on his arm to make plays late in the game. 
“You’ve got to have that balance between run and pass,” Helton said. “If you commit to stopping the run, you have to be able to throw the ball … and then convert on 3rd-and-short with that run. Thank goodness the passing game came through that last game.”
On the defensive side, USC will be challenged due to a slew of recent injuries. Junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin will be out indefinitely with a lingering big toe injury and a torn bicep. He finished with two sacks alone in the first half against Texas. While junior nickelback Ajene Harris returned to practice on Thursday, Helton was unsure if he’d be able to play a full game against Cal. Meanwhile, both senior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and junior defensive tackle Rasheem Green have been dealing with nagging knee injuries.

The Interfraternity Council sent out a letter Thursday to the USC community expressing its disagreement with the Academic Senate’s resolution from 2015 to defer Greek recruitment to spring.
The letter said that the IFC leadership met with USC administrators on Sept. 13 who again asked to push Greek recruitment to the spring semester, citing mental health concerns among first-year students.
“While we take these concerns to heart, the Interfraternity Council does not believe that the administration’s recruitment eligibility proposal will combat issues of academic stress,” the letter read.
The letter explained that research suggested that anxiety and stress from first-year students typically stemmed from a sense of loneliness, and that deferring fraternity and sorority recruitment to the spring would remove a support system already in place by the organizations.
“I don’t think it’s USC who should make a decision whether [first-year students] should join Greek life or not,” said Alexander Lorenzo Cuoci, president of the IFC.
Cuoci said that while he rushed during his spring semester freshman year, he understands that students come to USC ready to join Greek organizations. He said that the IFC is willing to have proactive conversations to offer viable solutions for the issues listed by administrators.
In the letter, the IFC leadership said they take responsibility for issues in the community and will work to create a safe environment for first-year students.
Cuoci added that Greek organization members will be emailing President C. L. Max Nikias, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Provost Michael Quick urging them to reconsider their decision.
“This [letter] is the last push to make sure that our voices are heard and that the administration is not just making decisions without hearing our voice,” Cuoci said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry responded to the letter with a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan following the time of publication.
Carry requested the statement be published in its entirety:
“To be clear, the proposal is not deferred recruitment. The University is accepting input on policy to require a minimum grade point average of 2.5 and completion of 12 units of course work at USC before going through the rigorous recruitment and new-members education process of joining a Greek-letter organization. In other words, allow first-year students one semester (90 days) to get adjusted to college academics and social life before going through the rigors of a 15-week new member education process. Under this policy, Greek-letter organizations would still be permitted to welcome new members in the fall semester that have at least a 2.5 GPA and completed 12 units at USC – sophomores, juniors, seniors, and spring admits who are in their second semester. In the following spring Greek-letter organizations would be able to recruit first-year students that have completed a semester at USC. We are examining implications of this policy for transfer students. I ask: “What is so unreasonable about giving first-year students 90 days to adjust to college life?” USC is not the first school in the country to prioritize the health, wellness and safety of new students by allowing them time to adjust to college life, many of our peers and aspirant institutions have similar policies.  For the past two weeks I have been sincerely listening to leaders of Greek councils and organizations on this matter and I will do so until a decision is finalized. The first year of college is the toughest. We owe our new students every opportunity to be successful in and outside the classroom. When there are opportunities to consider changes that may improve the quality of the student experience, reduce stress and anxiety, and give students the time they need to adjust to college life, I will examine it. USC remains committed to prioritizing student health and wellbeing.”

Thursday marked the 26th anniversary of Armenia obtaining independence from Soviet rule, and professor Frank Zerunyan celebrated by wearing his Armenian army uniform.
On all other days, Zerunyan proudly displays the gift from the defense minister of Armenia on a hanger in his office in Lewis Hall. Zerunyan is of Armenian descent, but has no familial connection to the country as it stands today.
Zerunyan teaches graduate level courses in the Sol Price School of Public Policy that focus on governance, negotiation and leadership, and he is in the process of establishing the Armenian Scholars program at USC. The 10-year program is set to begin in Fall 2019, the semester the first scholar arrives.  
The program’s goal is to consecutively bring five scholars from Armenia to enroll in the doctorate in public policy and management program at the Price School. Upon graduating, each student will return to Armenia to form a public policy and management department at a university. By the end of the 10th year, the department will have five employees, all graduates of the USC program. If a scholar commits to working for the department for at least five years, USC will pay for his or her education.
“Every year, we will try to recruit someone with a variation of interest in public policy and management so that we don’t have duplicates,” Zerunyan said. “Even though they will all come from Price, we will make sure that they all matriculate into different disciplines.”
The idea for the Armenian Scholars program was conceived about five years ago when Zerunyan began traveling to Armenia to teach. It was at Yerevan State University, the largest university in the country, where Zerunyan realized public management is only offered at the undergraduate and master’s levels in Armenia; a doctoral program in public management does not exist.
After brainstorming ways to combat the issue, he asked colleagues from Yerevan State University to write him a letter about the need for a doctoral program in public management. He then presented the document, as well as his ideas for the Armenian Scholars program, to Jack H. Knott, dean of the Price School.
Zerunyan said Knott supported the idea then and still supports it today.
“Through establishing this Price School doctorate program, we will have the opportunity to prepare the first generation of Armenian scholars and educators in public policy and management,” Knott said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It will help to improve Armenian governance, professional public management and democratic political development. This program will reflect USC’s moral imperative to use its expertise to make a positive global impact.” 
According to Zerunyan, the Los Angeles area is the largest Armenian community outside of Armenia itself, making USC the perfect place for the program.
 “My hope is that this becomes the hub of the caucuses in the former Soviet Republics as the premier institution for public policy and management doctorate programs,” he said.
Zerunyan said he will begin recruiting scholars when he teaches in Armenia next summer, and plans to make a final decision by January 2019. In the meantime, he said he will prepare, develop and raise funds for the program. 
“To me, this is a mission,” Zerunyan said. “We want them to go back and provide that mission back to the country.”

After a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico on Tuesday, Arturo Cajal, a Ph.D. student studying mechanical engineering, knew he could not sit back and watch his home country crumble to the ground.
He felt that there was not much he could do from the United States, but nevertheless he needed to do something. 
For that reason he and approximately 10 other Mexican students formed a group to set up a relief fund to aid those in the Mexico City area who have been affected by the earthquake, which has now killed over 270 people, according to Telemundo Noticias.
The group Aid For Mexico, has set up a booth on Trousdale Parkway near Founders Park, and encourages people to donate either through a Venmo account or relief organizations like Topos de Tlatelolco, which aids those affected by natural disasters worldwide. They will be accepting donations for the next week.
“By fortune, we were able to start this and I feel more relieved that I’m doing something for my country,” Cajal said. “But there is still a lot of work to be done.”
The group of students is working with Iniciativa México Innova, an initiative of the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles that aims to increase the network of Mexican immigrants in Southern California. 
The students opened a bank account through this nonprofit to assure that all donations are transferred directly to Cruz Roja Mexicana. Just after two days of collecting funds, they have already gathered over $500, according to Cajal.
Donating money through this medium is the most transparent method, according to Francisco Valero-Cuevas, a professor of engineering at USC and the president of Iniciativa Mexico Innova. 
The group is working with the Consulate General of México, along  with El Centro Chicano, the Latina/o Student Assembly and the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science at USC.
El Centro Chicano will be one of the locations where those wishing to help can donate funds, according to Billy Vela, the center’s director.
“We all got together and got our heads around it,” Vela said. “Now the hope is that we can get the rest of the University involved, not just Latinx Trojans.”
While the group hopes to expand its involvement beyond just Latinx students, it’s aware that Mexican students are most impacted by the earthquake, since it hit close to home.
Alejandra Ramos, a graduate student in the specialized journalism program, is one of these students. Ramos was born in Mexico City and said she is still in shock seeing her hometown go through a natural disaster like this one.
“My heart is broken,” Ramos said. “Even in my neighborhood, the buildings are collapsing. It’s shocking and I don’t think any one of us was mentally prepared to be living this.”
Ramos said she is proud to see her community come together to help save as many lives as possible, but she hopes that efforts expand past Mexico City.
“I am so happy to see society together, because I don’t think the government is doing enough,” Ramos said. “I think the efforts need to focus on all the places that are not receiving help, because there is no accessibility there.”
Isabel Velasquez, who donated to the Aid For Mexico fund and is a graduate student in the School of Social Work, agreed with Ramos. She said her family currently lives in Puebla, a city less than 40 miles away from the epicenter of the earthquake and that many houses in her family’s pueblo were destroyed and many are still without electricity and are receiving little to no help.
“A lot of the small pueblos aren’t getting enough help from the government,” she said. “I understand that [Mexico City] had a lot of damage, but there are also a lot small towns around the city that also need help that aren’t getting any help.”
Velasquez said that she wishes she could be in Mexico helping the victims of the disaster, but was glad she could pitch in to the relief fund and will be volunteering with the student group.
“I feel like I am useless,” she said. “My donation is nothing compared to the people out there trying to help but I can’t go out there and help myself.”
As the efforts continue to save lives and bring the country back to normal, Ramos believes that the earthquake will have long-lasting effects on her beloved Mexico.
“I think we are no longer the same people,” she said. “Nothing is going to be the same.”

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
On Sept. 7, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced controversial changes she intended to implement at the Department of Education regarding Title IX, a law requiring gender equity in institutions receiving federal funding. While these changes specifically affect campus sexual assault, another issue involving gender inequality on college campuses has gone widely ignored for years: reproductive health.
Students’ ability to make safe, healthy decisions about their bodies is integral to their ability to pursue academic excellence. About 80 percent of the millions of Planned Parenthood patients across the country go to the women’s health organization as their main source of contraceptive access, which Planned Parenthood relies on Medicaid reimbursements to provide. But in April, President Donald Trump signed a bill allowing states to take away Medicaid funding from organizations that provide abortion services, which could result in the shutdown of local clinics around colleges that female college students rely on. 
The potential for this women’s health care insufficiency must be addressed by institutions of higher learning such as USC. Universities have an obligation to offer reliable access to crucial reproductive health resources on campuses, or perpetuate inequality by placing a burden on female students but not their male peers. For example, female students in need of abortion services are often forced to miss class, internships or their jobs to travel to have the procedure, incurring costs and anxiety that can impede their academic performances. 
On USC’s campus, the absence of reliable, hormonal birth control options or emergency contraception only increases the risk of unintended pregnancy, and the lack of childcare services offered at the University amount to a difficult environment for female students with children.
In April, UC Davis made monumental progress in this area. The institution installed a Plan B vending machine, which offered — among other reproductive healthcare products — emergency contraception, condoms, pregnancy tests, tablets for urinary pain relief and a range of feminine hygiene products. At UC Berkeley, the student government passed a resolution demanding medication abortion in the campus health center, and the university’s Students United for Reproductive Justice group took an active role in moving state legislation to require all California public colleges offer the abortion pill. The legislation passed the State Assembly and the Health Committee of the State Senate, and is presently being considered by the Education Committee.
Public colleges in the state of California are doing their part to promote gender equity by prioritizing reproductive health on college campuses. As a well-endowed private institution, there is no excuse for USC to be lagging behind. USC’s health center carries condoms, menstrual products and a number of birth control services on an appointment-basis, and Plan B at its campus pharmacy. But long lines and inconvenient scheduling to access these products ignores the sense of urgency around reproductive health. Immediately accessible distribution of Plan B on campuses through vending machines in residential halls is crucial because the number of hours between unprotected sex and ingestion of Plan B must be minimized in order to be effective.
That being said, this is not just about Plan B. There is a reason that UC Davis’ reproductive health vending machine carries a number of different products: Reproductive health is a broad issue ranging from preventing pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted infections to accommodating students with unique family situations and gender orientations. 
Ideological reservations about female sexuality, gender nonconformity and casual sex should not dictate the living standards and opportunities of USC’s students. And simultaneously, many situations involving the need for reproductive health care do not arise out of student choices.
As an institution of higher learning, USC is in its best shape when every member of its diverse study body is in the best position to contribute their unique skills and intellectual capital, and when male and female students are on equal footing to excel in their academics. The stress and mental and physical health struggles and range of other barriers to accessing crucial health care services can impede young women’s ability to succeed. If not out of concern with morality and student well-being, USC should, at the very least, note how offering incomplete reproductive health care could negatively impact its prestige as an elite institution. 
Reproductive health care is not expensive to provide; if anything, it is an investment in ensuring that University students have everything they need to succeed. The limited accessibility of reliable women’s health care is not only detrimental to the University at large, but also arguably contribute to campus gender inequity.

In today’s news we learn that the incidence of new cases of STD’s in California is at record highs, especially in the under 25 year age range.  I’m thinking condoms are the solution here, not powerful medications like Plan B.  Better still, keep it zipped.
The article’s accompanying image leaves the impression that USC must do more to prioritize the distribution of lubricants.

This Tuesday, National Voter Registration Day comes around once again. This time last year, I took some time to harp on the civic necessity of voter registration; happily, and with that same sense of American urgency, I’m here to do it again.
I’ll spare you the lofty ideals of civic duty, political efficacy, the American privilege of participation in the future of our great nation and skip to the pragmatic part: Millennials represent a huge chunk of the electorate — or at least, they would, if they bothered to turn out. Of course, we’re not entirely to blame — we had higher turnout numbers in the last election cycle than other cycles of our recent political past, and had we been the only demographic to vote, Donald Trump would have been defeated by alarming margins. Thus, the young electorate possesses a pretty significant political power, and overwhelmingly seeks to support progressive causes. Our electorate could change this country with that power — if only it were willing to wield it. 
Of course, politicians are nothing if not pragmatic, and they know as well as the rest of us that millennial turnout is often dismal. And as you can probably infer yourself, they’re not in the least incentivized to include millennial issues in their platform or use their offices to achieve millennial goals if they cannot rely on the payoff — i.e., if they act in our favor or run based on our interests, they still cannot be reasonably certain of winning your ballot — because they cannot be sure you will submit a ballot at all.
Low registration goes hand-in-hand with low turnout. Gerrymandering and economic burden aside, even the millennial voter registration of privileged upper- and middle-class communities is exceedingly disappointing. If we register in higher numbers on this day, and before the upcoming midterms, we will send a direct message to those carefully watching voter demographics and electoral strategy: In an era in which our college educations, our affordable health care, our post-grad job prospects, our civil and human rights and our future international affairs and capabilities are all on the line, the millennials are no longer laying down. 
The absence of perfect political conditions is the nature of politics itself. If you refused to turn out in November because Bernie Sanders wasn’t on the ballot, perhaps the lovely Trump era has made you recognize how beautiful pragmatism can really be. This Tuesday, ensure you are registered. I’m sure Sanders will continue running around looking vaguely disheveled, endearingly shouting and endorsing anti-choice candidates in future cycles; let him rely on your vote. If you believe California’s heavy Democratic swing means your voice won’t count, change that by participating in local and state politics to a far greater degree. Don’t give in to conservative attrition in California — go fight that life-saving health care, or whatever else it is that makes your fists shake with self-righteousness. Let them rely on your vote.
Either way, whatever your cause is, it goes unheard if your vote is unreliable. If our registration numbers are still abysmal, and if politicians still cannot believe that working on behalf of your interests will be fruitful and reliable, your wishes will go ungranted. No one — no one — cares about the needs of the armchair activist or the apathetic non-voter. You’re not political? Chances are that at least part of your discipline’s field, your higher education, your family’s health care is federally subsidized or even partially funded. Politics is not only characterized by the idolization of one specific candidate or another, or the catharsis of shouting into the ether for your cause. Whether you see it as fickle, or you’re simply “not into that” — trust me, you are — you are deeply invested in more ways than one. The endless sea churns with or without you. And whether you choose to take the horse by the reins or leave your country to whichever way the wind blows, change will come, and it will affect you and the things you care about. Don’t be part of the idiocy of a “come what may” philosophy. Make sure that change is a change you wanted. Vote.

Emma Peplow | Daily Trojan
Harry Styles isn’t your typical rockstar.
He has a smattering of tattoos, but of arbitrary, non-threatening objects — a mermaid, a butterfly, sparrows. Underneath his perfectly coiffed pompadour lies a verisimilar face reminiscent of gritty rock god Mick Jagger. He transitioned from the guilty-pleasure, wholesome pop of his former boy band One Direction to a debut solo album that is as unapologetically rock as it is self-aware — all without his fans seeming to bat an eye.
And nowhere was Styles’ enigmatic effervescence on display more so than in his sold-out show at the Greek Theatre Wednesday night performing his eponymous debut album. In the second show of his first world tour and first Los Angeles show as a solo act, Styles employed the screams, the theatrics, the frenzy originating with the ‘70s rock that brought us Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and the Sex Pistols, on the stage just a few feet away from merchandise booths selling shirts that have “TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS” emblazoned across the front. Maybe “kindness” didn’t have a place in the rock and roll pioneered by Styles’ forerunner Jagger, but that’s what’s remarkable about Styles — he is a 21st century rock star. He sets the terms.
Throughout his set, he was cognizant of his rock influences. Styles, dressed in a teal and gold patterned, wide-legged suit was flanked on both sides by suited guitarists, while a drummer sat on a tall pedestal behind him and a keyboardist stood next to the drummer. Minus the keyboardist, Styles assembled his band in the classic Beatles’ formation. The ’70s-inspired suits, the line of three guitarists, the raised drummer — Styles wants you to know he did his rock and roll homework before jumping from the sometimes vapid world of pop. He also indulged in the rock star tongue waggle during one of his more hard rock tracks, “Only Angel,” and danced like a rock star banshee during his most archetypal rock song, “Kiwi.”
A remarkable moment came when he performed the Fleetwood Mac classic “The Chain” to a crowd of fans singing along to all the words, though most were not yet born at the time of its 1977 release. Throughout the show Styles brought a new generation of fans into the long-held secrets of rock and roll, while making his mark on a new rock era.
Though the concert weighed heavily on the side of rock influences — heavy drums, heavy guitar riffs and high-pitched shrieks marked the hour and 15 minutes of the performance — Styles did not shy away from his pop past, performing covers of two One Direction songs: “Stockholm Syndrome” and “What Makes You Beautiful.” Perhaps it was to acknowledge his roots or maybe to show how far he has come, but there was something striking about the songs being sung not in a pop capacity by five fresh-faced young men, but by a five-piece band with real instruments, a rock arrangement and a lead singer oozing with the confidence that only a mature performer can possess. That night, his stage presence was markedly different from his show business debut at age 16.
Styles’ performance was minimalist in a way few of his contemporaries’ large concert tours are. He went through most songs without speaking in between, and with the exceptions of his more uptempo rock tracks, stood relatively still behind a microphone stand, either singing or playing the guitar. Styles, perhaps in alignment with the highly personal nature of his album, kept stoic, almost low-energy for the majority of the performance, breaking only a few times to giggle at a failing microphone or to employ a few self-deprecating lines of humor about his short set due to his limited discography.
And the crowd more than made up for Styles’ mellow demeanor. It might be a tired comparison to equate the reactions of One Direction fans with Beatlemania, but the intensity of response Styles evokes from his fans with the slightest flash of a grin or sway in between verses must be unprecedented. Tears, hyperventilation and screams are just a few symptoms of “Harrymania.” 
But Styles’ muted performance worked for him. The show had plenty of theatrics — his ostentatious wardrobe choice, the sweeping rock ballad hit “Sign of the Times” as Styles’ final performance of the evening — but Styles’ demeanor and the stage itself were not among them. This night was about the music, not him — though surely the fans reduced to sobs upon hearing the first notes of “Ever Since New York” as the show began would disagree.
Styles has built his career on being elusive. He gives you just enough to be intrigued, but never enough to be fully satisfied. He rides the border. He embraces androgyny; he’s the bad boy rockstar that preaches kindness; he’s the most talked-about without talking much at all; he looks new wave in a suit that even the ’70s probably would have looked upon as tacky.
Contradictory, yes. Perplexing, perhaps. But there’s just something about Harry Styles, the solo performer, that sticks. And no, he won’t tell you what it is.

I grew up amid a whirlwind of start-ups, coding and technology. People learned the word “entrepreneur” before they learned algebra. My entire life, I lived a hop, skip and a jump away from the most revolutionary companies in the world. As I matured, I realized that medicine, engineering or coding were not what I ultimately wanted to pursue, and this isolated me further and further from the community I called home. I detested the looks of hesitation and awkward pauses that I got when I told people that I wanted to major in journalism in college — and then the looks of relief when I said that I probably wanted to go to law school. There is a short list of acceptable humanities paths to pursue in the Bay Area — and law school is one of the few. 
Throughout high school, I grew more and more resentful of what I thought the entirety of the Bay Area was. I wanted the same number of opportunities that “the STEM kids had.” I aggressively branded myself as a “humanities person” by emphasizing that I never wanted to touch other subjects. I did this just to make a statement, even though I had greatly enjoyed math and science. I felt that barely anyone truly appreciated what I wanted to do and I vowed leave home as fast as possible, and never move back. 
A year into college, my negatively tainted view of my hometown was only amplified. Los Angeles seemed significantly more cultured to me — with its countless museums, well-attended indie film screenings and media companies in every nook and cranny. Whenever I went home, I raved about how much I loved Los Angeles and how central it was to my college experience. But my love for Los Angeles and determination to make it my home felt both forced and necessary. Don’t get me wrong: I fell head over heels in love with the city and continue to appreciate it every single day. But, at least some part of my infatuation stemmed from a feeling that I had something to prove. 
This past summer, despite my attempt to be rebellious and escape the Silicon Valley, my desire to be with family and friends pulled me back home. And I had a completely different experience than my first 18 years spent at home. During my writing and public policy internships, I uncovered an entirely new side to the Bay Area that I had never witnessed or taken the time to discover. I found people who were completely dedicated to projects and initiatives that perfectly aligned with my interests. I learned about companies and opportunities in my field of study that only the resources of the Silicon Valley could make possible, such as start-ups that attempted to increase voter registration and connect politically engaged individuals, companies using their resources to build subsidized, affordable housing for community members that they displaced, or the utilization of virtual reality to bring journalism and media closer to audiences. The intersection of technology, politics and media offered endless opportunities that I had never even considered. I realized that in my stubbornness to escape from my hometown, I had never really given it a chance. 
I did not have an epiphany that completely changed the way I saw my hometown. The Bay Area is far from perfect. The drive and meritocracy that are idealized rapidly turn into cutthroat competition, especially for adolescents and younger generations. The culture of diversity and equality that the Silicon Valley prides itself on is greatly lacking, as evidenced by several cases with Uber, Google and other work environments that perpetuate the “bro culture.” And, in an attempt to produce the best and grow in the most profitable way, the Silicon Valley can often forget to account for the marginalized communities and consequences of their actions. 
I am well-aware of the problems that run rampant where I grew up. After all, I spent the last five years dwelling on everything I hated about it. But it did feel good to fall in love with the place that I still continue to call my home. To recognize the strengths and benefits of living in a place that had the characteristics of the Silicon Valley. To find opportunities that were exciting and innovative. And most importantly, for the first time, I felt confident that I could contribute significantly to my community. Whether it be attempting to solve the social and economic problems that plague the area or working for one of the companies that I had once completely dismissed, I felt that I had the responsibility to return to make it better. And that’s how you know that something is truly important to you.

For Manny Sanoja, the  journey matters just as much as the destination. After years of soul searching, the recently self-published author of Enlightened Awakening: A Practical Guide to Self Awareness, Hope and Healing credits his successes to personal experience. 
Since he was a child, Sanoja dreamt of pursuing classical piano and later experimented in vocal performance, going through what he dubbed a “boy band era.” However, after the devastating death of his father in 2004, he turned to writing poetry to filter the pain and channel his emotions while simultaneously working numerous jobs and later moving to Arizona. After three years away from home, he decided to return to school to pursue his love for music. He moved back to California and attended Bakersfield College where he met a choir coach who praised his talent and believed in his capabilities, urging him to apply to USC’s Thornton School of Music. 
Sanoja would go on to graduate from Thornton with a Bachelor of Arts in music with an emphasis in vocal arts and opera in 2014. After graduation, he performed in opera tours, but realized he needed a stable career in addition to music and writing and became a financial analyst alongside his two passions. Sanoja currently works as the associate manager for Prudential Financial.
“Eventually, I found a lot of comfort in reading self-improvement [and] personal development books, and it resonated with me,” Sanoja said. “Music and writing were hand-in-hand in finding … and reestablishing myself and finding my purpose.”
Although being an author was never in his original plan, Sanoja credits the process of self discovery in helping him understand his meaning and believes he has been called to write in hopes of helping others. 
“I just thought that it was so cool — that my own difficult journey and experiences helped people,” Sanoja said. “It made me feel like I was giving back in using my talents and abilities. I think that was a really satisfying point in my life, and I knew from then on that I needed to keep writing.” 
Sanoja’s book Enlightened Awakening is the first volume in a three-part series and was published within a month, released on July 26. It contains short pieces that aim to inspire readers. At the core of this daily guide, Sanoja challenges his readers to ask and answer the question of “why?” in reference to some of life’s most challenging queries. 
To him, self-awareness means being cognizant of one’s actions and the affect they can have on others. He said this includes understanding that being vulnerable is important in the process and making the conscious decision to be a better person. His book is based on these observations, alluding to topics such as commitment to one’s own purpose and choosing positivity despite outside influence and external circumstance. 
“It reminds us of our condition,” Sanoja said. “It’s easy to fall into the traps of what society tells us [that] makes us happier and what we need to be. It reminds people to focus on what’s important … and not what the world says. It’s really what’s in your heart.” 
Sanoja will host a book signing for Enlightened Awakening at the University Bookstore on Oct. 6 from 12 to 4 p.m. 
“I’m grateful USC is welcoming me back … I’m just happy to be there and hopefully give some inspiration to the students on campus who are going through hard times,” Sanoja said. “Hopefully the things I’ve been through can help them, and when they pick up this book … some of the words will resonate with them in a way that’s helpful to them. I hope it can bring the same hope and healing that it brought to my life because that’s ultimately what my goal is.” 
I thank the author of this book, Manny Sanjoya, for writing it. Thank you for simply sharing your gifts. Your wisdom will no doubt benefit so many people, as this type of paying forward is exponential in its output of the positive, something that is greatly needed in this world. I hope your altruistic spirit inspires others to realize their worth and their potential, and to give back as well.

Welcome to Sex and the Campus, a weekly column where I discuss all things love and relationships. It should be noted that I do not claim to be any kind of expert in either area. Dating is hard, but hopefully reading this column won’t be. 
If you have any burning questions about love and relationships or just have a good dating horror story to share, feel free to send them to dailytrojanblogs@gmail.com 
This week, we’re talking about dating. Not just any kind of dating, though. I’m giving my personal thoughts on how to date with a chronic illness.
11 years ago, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. It’s an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the colon among other unpleasant symptoms. In other words, it’s a “bathroom disease.” I spent the majority of my tweens and teens moving in and out of hospitals, trying new treatments, and desperately waiting for my boobs to magically spring forth. 
I was lonely, emaciated and severely insecure. “Love” was a four letter word — and something I truly didn’t know if I’d ever get to experience outside my family. I lived vicariously through the characters in books I read; they were brave, beautiful, and always ended up with their one true love, no matter the obstacles they had to overcome. 
High school was a complete bust to say the least. As a skinny new kid who always got a free pass to the bathroom, I wasn’t exactly prom queen material. This was before “politically correct” culture, where people with disabilities were more respected and even revered in some cases. No, I was just weird. 
Coming to college was a complete culture shock. I was able to completely reinvent myself, and my health was on the upswing as well — oh, and I finally got boobs. The attention from boys was intoxicating, but it wasn’t enough to fully extinguish my insecurities. I finally felt “normal,” but I was as empty as ever. 
I still wasn’t being honest about who I was. My illness is not all that I am, but it is a huge part of my identity and my life. But when’s a good time to explain to someone what they’re getting into when they decide to date me? Between dances at a fraternity party? This sickness became my biggest secret, and it left me feeling really alone. 
Then came a boy. A year ago, I agreed to go on a blind invite date — I had no idea what saying yes would mean. To say that we hit it off is a gross understatement; it was like we had known each other forever. He instantly became my best friend, the person I wanted to spend as much time with as possible, and with whom I could truly be vulnerable. 
About a month into dating, I went into the worst flare-up since coming to college. This boy who I barely knew now had to see me at my worst. I was waiting for him to take off screaming. I wasn’t his problem and neither was my health. But something amazing happened instead: He stayed. Not only did he stay, but he also became my biggest support system. He made me feel normal even when my body was revolting against me. 
It’s been a year now and my health has still had many ups and downs, but he’s been there riding every wave with me. Some days I’m the biggest bitch and others I’m a pile of mush.Somehow, he never takes it personally. I know it’s hard for him though.When he hears the words “chemo-drugs”and he doesn’t understand why I have to be on them. When I have a bad reaction to anesthesia during a colonoscopy and end up with a 103-degree fever. When date nights have to be cut short because my colon is completely unpredictable. And when feeling “sexy” is so not going to happen.
 I see the fear in his eyes when he realizes that my future health is scarily uncertain. I think that the worst part is the questions we can’t answer: Will I have another flare? Will I graduate? Will I keep my colon? Can I have kids? Could they have the same illness? Yet through it all, he remains. 
Dating with a chronic illness is not easy. There’s a lot of awkward moments, tears and uncertainty, but it’s so worth it in the end. Everyone deserves to find love or even just a fun night out with free food. Don’t limit yourself, don’t let society limit you, and don’t limit your partner. Let them be there for you and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable — do this and they’ll be there for every doctor’s appointment, hospital visit, and scary moment. All relationships have their obstacles and a chronic illness is just one of them.

Brennen Lopez | Daily Trojan
After a full weekend of games at the Aggie Roundup, the men’s water polo team charges into yet an even more jam-packed weekend as it takes on UC San Diego on Thursday and then co-hosts the Mountain Pacific Invitational with Loyola Marymount Friday through Sunday. 
By the end of the weekend, the Trojans will have played five full games, which is a daunting task. The Trojans know this and are trusting their training and mentally preparing for it, so they can show up to each game with the same amount of energy. 
“I think the most difficult part is just going to be getting tired,” senior utility Mihajlo Milicevic said. “We just have to deal with that fatigue and we just have to stay focused and stay motivated because we have five games this week. We just have to be motivated for each game and go step by step just to stay focused.”
The Trojans’ first game on Thursday is not attached to the tournament, but it is still a significant part of their overall weekend. The team always talks about focusing on each game as it comes, but the Trojans are using the game against UCSD as a sort of trial run for the tournament. It will be at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, like the tournament, and will give them a chance to show their home crowd what kind of play to expect this weekend. 
“It is going to be a great game,” Milicevic said. “It is going to be more of a great practice for us before the tournament because San Diego is a great opponent. It’s just more for us to prepare for the tournament.”
Nine games into the season and still undefeated, the Trojans know how important each game is to reaching their goal of a national championship title. Even though they have conquered each opponent so far, they know that they have a long way to go before they will be satisfied. This weekend plays right into that mindset, as they plan to take each game at a time and learn from them in order to play even better the next game.
“Every practice we have, we practice different plays and different strategies,” Milicevic said.  “We tried to implement that during those games, and it helped us find out more about each other — what are our weaknesses, what are our strengths and what we should work on in the future.”
The tournament is setting up to be a big one. The Trojans will start off by facing San Jose State on Friday. With a victory, they will come up against either UC Irvine or UC Santa Barbara Saturday morning. From there, they have a chance at a rematch, as they could end up taking on Long Beach State or Stanford again Saturday evening. The biggest potential match would be the final on Sunday, as the Trojans, if they make it to the finals, could potentially play Cal, which beat them last season at the national championships. For USC, making it to that game is the goal so that it can redeem itself and show Cal that this year is different. 
More than anything, though, the Trojans are excited to play this next set of games at home in front of their crowd of loyal fans. After a long weekend away, they are happy to be back at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. For them, the atmosphere is different at home than away, and they feel the crowd helps them with their energy and ultimately in protecting their house.
“It is always great playing at USC, at our own pool,” Milicevic said. “It is just completely different. It is going to help us a lot.”
The Trojans’ game against UC San Diego begins at 5 p.m. on Thursday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

My kids will never play football.
This is a conversation that we have a lot around the sports office at the Daily Trojan. Whenever it comes up, the debate is short. Yes, football is a fun sport — if not the most fun sport — to watch. But it seems ridiculous, almost villainous, to allow our children to play.
I love football. My parents met at a bar owned by a former Kansas City Chiefs player and got engaged at Arrowhead Stadium. In the fall I live and breathe the sport along with most of the USC campus. It’s hard not to love everything about the game — the touching back stories; the arcing deep tosses to the end zone; the dazzling trick plays; and, of course, the big hits.
So much of football is based upon the sport’s simple brutality. There is a beauty in its violence, something extremely primal and exceedingly satisfying that keeps us coming back for more. There’s a reason the NFL generated over $13 billion in 2016; the game gained popularity for transforming physical, grungy, head-to-head competition into sheer entertainment. And when a football game is on, it’s hard to look away.
And yet I repeat, unflinchingly, that my children will never put on pads and a helmet. It won’t even be an option, and I won’t feel any guilt for keeping them from the sport, even if they love it, crave it or claim that they need it. 
If you need an explanation, just open The New York Times. Three days ago, the paper reported on a study produced by a Boston University research team specializing in concussion research among football players.
The researchers found that children who play tackle football before the age of 12 are likely to struggle with brain problems later in life. Playing even a season between the ages of eight and 13 causes boys to suffer from diminished brain function throughout the rest of their lives. In short, football destroys the minds of the young and often clueless children who play it.
Honestly, the study affirms what common sense should have already told any parent signing their child up for Pop Warner. This isn’t all that surprising if you think about the basics of the game: tackling on defense and breaking tackles on offense. This is a game of big hits, and it celebrates every body-to-body clash.
Take the USC offense, for example. One of the aspects of the offense I laud the most is the ability of the running backs to power through contact. The backs earn most of their rushing yards after an initial hit, breaking tackles to sprint into the open field. Sometimes, these yards come from breaking sloppy arm tackles or hurdling over diving defenders. But often, the running backs earn these yards by lowering their heads, slamming into a defender and continuing to power forward.
Meanwhile, our defense prides itself in its ability to “set its jaw” and provide hard hits. These players aim to meet the offense at the line of scrimmage and not give up an inch. Their success is based on the physical ability to outlast and overpower any opponents.
It’s truly impossible to watch these players in action without acknowledging that damage must be occurring. These players are huge — 210 pounds and heavier, built of solid muscle — and they move at high speeds for spectacular crashing tackles. And although empirical evidence such as the study from Boston University validates this knowledge, the fact that football isn’t safe is intrinsic to the game itself.
I’ll be watching the game on Saturday, and I’ll most likely continue to report on it for years to come. But the one thing that I am set upon is never adding another number to the statistics. I won’t let my children play football because I don’t think any more brains need to be damaged by this sport.
And I urge others to do the same. I will never deny the appeal of football. It’s an intense, addicting game to watch. It’s been a central part of my life, my family and my career for as long as I can remember. It’s pure, unadulterated fun — but only when watched through a lens of ignorance.
We must reach a breaking point. Whether it’s stories of players dropping dead in high school, or repeated studies showing that we risk our children’s lives by putting them in this sport before they can pronounce chronic traumatic encephalopathy, we must reach a breaking point. 
There is only so long that we can continue to go on with our eyes shut, watching this game while ignoring what happens when it ends. And when we open our eyes, I think every football fan will see the truth — the lifespan of football has an expiration date, and it starts with the children of our generation.

Congrats Julia !
Very Brave article Julia. I agree with you 100%.
Be very careful what you read and watch on tv.  agenda driven. “through the lens of ignorance”
Bottom line: USC students and alumni deserve the best.

On Wednesday, No. 5 USC continued preparation for their first road game of the season against Cal, focusing on containing the Bears’ aggressive defense.
Trojans ready for stout Cal defense
Last year, Cal possessed the worst defense in all of the Pac-12, allowing the most points per game (42.6) and the most rushing yards (3,274). However, new head coach Justin Wilcox has injected new life into the Bears’ defense this year, as the unit looked impressive last week in a win over Ole Miss, sacking the quarterback five times. On Wednesday, USC prepared for Wilcox’s aggressive defensive schemes.   
“We worked a lot of Cal’s pressures,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I’ve been really impressed with the blitz packages that they do. Each and every week, it seems to change based on your protection … You look up and they have nine sacks on the year in three games and that’s pretty dang impressive.”
Cal senior linebacker Devante Downs is one opposing player USC’s offense will need to keep tabs on. He currently leads the team in tackles (32), sacks (3) and interceptions (2) through the first three games.
Wilcox served as USC’s defensive coordinator in 2014 and 2015. While the Cal defense is currently excelling under his direction, the Trojans struggled with him at the helm, giving up over 400 yards per game.
USC imitates road environment
For their first three contests, the Trojans had the luxury of playing in front of the comfort of the Coliseum. This weekend, they travel to Berkeley for their first road game at the California Memorial Stadium. 
“Obviously this is our first road game,” Helton said. “So we filtered in some in-house crowd noise to be able to function there.”
For several young key players, like freshman running back Stephen Carr and freshman kicker Chase McGrath, this will be their first experience playing in a hostile environment.
“All of a sudden you’re in a new stadium, a new locker room, there’s crowd noise which you didn’t have for three games straight offensively,” Helton said. “It changes things and you’ve got to try to make sure that you give as much adverse conditions out here so it becomes a comfort level once they get there.”

The No. 21 USC women’s volleyball team (9-3, 1-0 Pac-12) kicked off its conference play with a dramatic five-set upset (25-21,15-25, 18-25, 25-21,15-11) over No. 11 UCLA (7-3, 0-1 Pac-12) at Pauley Pavilion. It was USC’s first victory at Pauley since 2015, and the fourth time in the last six meetings between the rivals that they went to five sets. 
On the upset, head coach Mick Haley pointed out that the team made a statement in its first conference match of the season. 
“It’s a really big deal, especially since UCLA is so highly respected in the polls,” Haley said. “Maybe some people will start looking at our team now.”
It was almost as if USC robbed the season opener right from under UCLA, as the Bruins put up a higher hitting percentage (.301 to .251), more kills (66 to 64) and more blocks (11.0 to 4.0). 
USC came out attacking from the backline. In the first set, the Trojans put up three service aces with only one serving error. Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier put up two aces and junior middle Brittany Welsh also went 3-for-3 in the first set. Her consistent attack from the middle kept UCLA on its toes, respecting the Trojans’ varied attack. 
The Women of Troy came out firing. Catching the Bruins a bit off-guard, USC was able to snag the 25-21 set win over UCLA in the first set.
UCLA took advantage of USC’s break in tip coverage to build a lead in the second set. After putting up a .242 hitting percentage in the first set, the Bruins bounced back to a .395 hitting percentage in the second. USC, on the other hand, dropped from a .286 hitting percentage to a .243 hitting percentage. The Bruins also recorded an ace of their own while USC did not have any. UCLA took a steady handle on the second set, grabbing a 10-point win over the Trojans, 25-15.
USC rebounded early in the third set, taking a 5-1 lead over the Bruins. UCLA didn’t gain its first lead of the set until going up 7-6, but a kill by Welsh tied the score back up for USC. 
USC gave up the lead early, but slowly chipped away at the lead that UCLA built. A kill from senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie put the Trojans within three, and the Bruins called a timeout. To get within tying the Bruins, the Trojans went back to serving aggressively and tightened up their defense. UCLA didn’t look bothered at all coming out of their timeout, taking a 19-15 lead.
Then, the Bruins broke out on a 4-1 with no signs of stopping. Haley called his second timeout of the set, attempting to put some brakes on UCLA’s run. Reily Buechler and Madeleine Gates left no space over the net for senior opposite Niki Withers, completely stuffing her attack for the 25-18 set victory. 
The fourth grew into a dramatic set. What began as a near formality for USC to force the fifth set turned into a near comeback for the Bruins before USC buckled down and scored their last couple of points. Abercrombie nailed down a kill in the center of UCLA’s side to pick up the set win, 25-21, for USC.
In the fourth and fifth sets, USC fell into a rhythm. After pulling ahead to a 7-1 lead in the fifth, USC never let UCLA pull closer than three points to tying. Through the fourth and fifth sets, USC held the lead the entirety of the sets. 
The Women of Troy’s late success came from keeping the ball in bounds and feeding workhorses Abercrombie and Lanier, who had 18 and 17 kills, respectively. Lanier and Abercrombie were responsible for eight kills — more than half the team’s points — in the final set.
Abercrombie dominated for USC, recording a team-high in kills and a .450 hitting percentage. The senior opposite only had one hitting error on the night. Junior outside hitter Alyse Ford, who didn’t start the match, made her presence known on the court throughout the fourth and fifth sets. 
“Every girl on the court is there for each other,” Abercrombie said. “We have each other’s backs.”
Abercrombie credited  the support throughout her team for their overall success. 
“It just shows that we can fight so hard as a team,” Abercrombie said. “We just want to win so badly, and we proved that we could do it.”
With the win over UCLA, USC moves to 32-10 in all-time conference openers — 12-5 under Haley. This victory also snapped a three-match losing streak for USC against its rivals. 
USC will next play at home on Sunday, their first time since August 26th, against Oregon State (10-3, 0-1 Pac-12) at 1 p.m. 
Congratulations to the team on the win. Big credit for hanging tough in the last two sets to pull out the victory.
Anytime you can beat the ‘ruins it is wonderful. Hope this propels the team to a good run in the conference , and
a post season invite. Fight On!

On any given Tuesday, there are upwards of 440 classes offered to undergraduate students at USC. On Tuesday, Sept. 5, Alex Currie wasn’t in any of them. 
Instead, Currie was at the 2017 Made in America Festival in Philadelphia, an annual music event founded by Jay-Z in 2012. But he wasn’t ditching class either. Currie is part of a new breed of student — the kind of student that flies across the country because he’s actually been hired by Jay-Z’s music streaming service. Like student-athletes and student-performers, Currie has a crucial hyphen to his student status: student-professional. 
More specifically, student-photographer (though he’s expanding his horizons). With his joint student and professional photographer status, he frequently  leaves campus for shoots, and, at any given time during the school year, has anywhere from a handful to a bafflingly-hard-to-manage number of professional photography and video projects to attend to. Any student studying in Leavey Library may be tempted to brand Currie’s student-professional photographer lifestyle an exceptionally glamorous one, but to argue that it is undeserved is much more challenging. 
Like anyone who ever became skilled at anything, Currie has been practicing for a while. Study Breaks estimated his foray into photography occurred at age 10; USC News suggested that he started out when he was 12. Neither one is right, necessarily, but also neither one is wrong: To pinpoint an exact date on which Currie started taking pictures is a fruitless endeavor. 
“I’ve been in school as long as I can remember, and I’ve also been taking pictures almost as long as I can remember,” Currie said. 
Practice makes perfect. And for Currie, practice has led to clients like Capitol Records, HBO, Sony Music and Warner Brothers. 
Despite his professional credits and impressive accolades (Flickr’s “20 Under 20” list and Complex’s “20 Best Photographers Under 20” list, to name a few), Currie is also a student, making a conscious decision to attend college, rather than forgoing school and trying to forge a professional career at the age of 18.
Creatively, the decision to attend college has paid off. Currie is majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Studying film and exploring parts of the Roski School of Art and Design library has shaped the way Currie thinks about himself.
“I think of myself less of a photographer and more of … a person,” Currie said. “I’m exploring more creative ideas — if it’s film or photography or web-based or artistic based.” 
And as a “person,” rather than exclusively a photographer, Currie has the agency to explore  and pursue new fields. His scholarly pursuits, to some extent, have granted him creative freedoms.
That said, it bears repeating that Currie is also an artist. As such, he says the confines of academia limit him, for personal and practical reasons. The structure and makeup of the classroom, for example, proves to be a significant roadblock.

“It’s hard to be creative and to make really creative work in school,” Currie said. “You’re kind of just surrounded by all like-minded people, you’re in a bubble and everything you’re being taught is really theoretical.” 
In other instances, the concrete constraints of USC’s campus present a different kind of creative roadblock. Accordingly, Currie feels he is more inspired away from campus, in nature or in Los Angeles. It’s there that he can separate the two environments. 
Separation is a theme that looms large for a student-professional like Currie. In fact, the term “student-professional” itself might not even be entirely fitting; the two worlds are often so removed that, as Currie said, the moniker of “person” could provide a much more practical, and much less fragmented, conception of self. In any case, the lifestyle of a college student and that of a professional, though instinctively contradictory, have created a useful dynamic for Currie. 
When asked if he has ever “double-dipped,” that is, used outside projects for school, he had a quick reply: “Freshman year, I had a video project due and I just submitted a slideshow of pictures instead. I was like, ‘Here! Here’s this.’”

The place is Vancouver and the year is 1948. The world is in recession, with banks plummeting and housing crises hitting every city throughout Canada. In the midst of it all, “tough guys and femme fatales” find themselves resorting to unethical measures to get by, scrambling and succumbing to daily gambling and vices. 
Welcome to the world of Helen Lawrence, a film noir that centers on an up-and-coming woman, Helen (played by Canadian Stage’s Crystal Balint), as she navigates through crime hotspots like Hotel Vancouver and Hogan’s Alley. From Oct. 13 to 14 at UCLA’s Royce Hall, students and the general public alike will have the chance to step into this film noir landscape in an experience that interlaces live-action theater as well as visual and cinematic arts. 
Coordinated by the Center for the Art of Performance, UCLA’s public arts unit, this Canadian Stage performance will showcase the work of world-renowned visual artist Stan Douglas and screenwriter Chris Haddock. Actors will appear in front of blue screens, which generate a 3-D facade of the run-down hotels and streets that make up the noir landscape. 
With Douglas’ signature visual arts technique and the accompanying technology, the performance will have actors looking more realistic in the “movie” pictured on blue screens than on stage. 
“[In this project], film noir meets theater in real time, live-action movie magic,” CAP UCLA Communications Manager Holly Wallace said.
Since late 2015, CAP UCLA has been planning the premiere of Helen Lawrence in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
While CAP UCLA boasts a season of ticketed performances that range from spoken word poetry to international dance, Art in Action is an additional public engagement program that hosts workshops, post-show discussions, symposiums and other art-focused activities tailored to the CAP performances. 
“[These activities] provide deeper meaning and explanation to many of the events we have in our season,” said Meryl Friedman, CAP UCLA’s director of education and special initiatives. 
For Helen Lawrence, Friedman and the rest of the Art in Action team started planning the artistic activities in late spring. Throughout the past four months, they have been communicating with the UCLA Library Special Collections, as it houses the papers of several noir writers, including Los Angeles-based writer Raymond Chandler. 
“Los Angeles is known for its noir film and literary movement,” Friedman said. “And since Special Collections holds many [works from] noir writers and comic book artists, we’re also doing a co-curation with the library to feature a number of things in that collection that relate to the noir literary movement, especially if it relates to Los Angeles.”
CAP UCLA’s Executive and Artistic Director Kristy Edmunds, says she has enjoyed evolving her curatorial focus by working in both visual and live performance mediums. The integration of these two forums was made possible through patronage from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which helped CAP UCLA collaborate with various museums and visual art spaces to introduce performance work into its repertoire.
Having already done a number of past projects with LACMA, such as spotlights on American composer John Zorn and choreographer Trisha Brown, CAP UCLA is receiving support of the Mellon Foundation alongside LACMA again. Since Douglas has holdings that are on display in LACMA, a project that blended his visual arts practice and his live performance practice resulted in the premiere of Helen Lawrence.
For Friedman, the method and mechanism behind the show’s execution allows the performance to be “beautiful, innovative and interesting.” She is most excited for the audience to enjoy the show and especially to witness Douglas’ perfected techniques in the visual arts and theater. 
“The story is new but set in an old noir tradition,” Friedman said. “It is very tongue-in-cheek and it’s like watching actors from old-fashioned movie on stage in real time. The way the crew uses video and film and live actors is this beautiful merging of digital art and technology and performance that you normally don’t get to see.”
CORRECTION: a previous version of this article cited Tricia Brown as a saxophonist. It has been updated to reflect Trisha Brown’s correct name and title (choreographer). The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

For as long as I can remember, I have been obsessed with figuring out the meaning of life. I have sort of a recurring issue, where every so often I stumble across some concept that seems like it might lead to a meaning, something that feels “right” or “important.”
Gradually, I start to think about this idea, better define it and construct a meaning of life around it, almost as if building a house or skyscraper, and every time, without fail, I eventually find some flaw or otherwise grow dissatisfied with my construction. And after a brief period of denial, it all comes crashing down. Annoyed, but still hopeful, I continue stumbling through life until another idea catches my attention and the process begins again.
A couple times in the past few years I have started to lose faith in my endeavor. After all, humans have been searching for meaning for millennia; if all of history’s greatest thinkers have failed in providing a meaning that I find satisfactory, who am I to think I could do better? Or perhaps there isn’t a meaning after all, and my search is destined to continue failing. But then again, when I do find an idea that seems meaningful, the feeling of rightness and emotional completeness that come with it seem unquestionably real — as real as the feeling you get the first time you hear a great song. This feeling has led to my new theory of meaning (well, not really “my” theory; the interested reader is encouraged to look up the “Metaphysics of Quality”).
Though we think scientific truth to be constant, our understanding of it is always in flux. Flaws are found in old theories, and new theories replace them, only to be replaced again by newer, less flawed theories; the cycle never ends. Similarly, the meaning of life is not a constant. It changes as each person understands it differently and develops it in their own way. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not real. If anything, the only way to find the meaning of life is to trust that feeling of rightness. When you find it, don’t pass it off as something imagined, or something you don’t have time to deal with. Take a step back, think about what caused the feeling, what it means and open your mind to the prospect of finding it again.
Near the end of my sophomore year, I heard Made Possible by The Bad Plus for the first time, and the opening track “Pound For Pound” was one of those moments of “rightness.” The quiet but driving pulse, swelling dynamics, textural diversity and elegantly simple yet gorgeous melody and harmony all come together to create something that at its core seems astonishingly profound. The way The Bad Plus is able to achieve this philosophical artistry is through a very natural style of improvisation, displayed also on tracks like “Seven Minute Mind,” “For My Eyes Only” and notably “In Stitches.” In this way, it only makes sense that so much of its music should have that “right” feeling for me, as their improvisation embraces change and impermanence rather than rejecting it, thereby embracing a more dynamic meaning too: a meaning that develops and grows with each iteration. A meaning that must exist, but can’t really be defined or explained, only felt.
If the meaning of life is always changing, then I must change with it. I must keep improvising in my own search for meaning and accept the destruction of my past meaningful constructs as positive learning experiences, and as opportunities to open my mind to the possibilities of all that the meaning of life can be — if only for a moment.

This week, Senate Republicans breathed new life into what seemed like a lost battle since the end of summer: the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Without the ACA and its protections for those with preexisting conditions, millions of disabled, elderly, sick and low-income Americans would lose insurance and, according to some estimates, thousands could die as a result. 
It’s no surprise that political maneuverings with such steep consequences for so many Americans’ everyday living standards have reinvigorated activism across the country. Over the summer, congressional phone lines were flooded with calls from enraged or terrified constituents, and disabled people staged “die-ins” by the dozens in Senate offices. The new Graham-Cassidy bill could yield the same reactions.
All of this demonstrates how the experience of oppression and political targeting does not give affected individuals the option to “be political” or not. You’d be hard-pressed to find an individual who has been fired or evicted for being gay, or an African-American mother grieving the loss of a young son to police brutality, indifferent about today’s political climate and current events. Political apathy and irritation at those darned “social justice warriors” emerge from a very specific group: those who do not face identity-based challenges and persecution from political institutions. 
The new Graham-Cassidy bill, like its previous incarnations, would be a disaster for a number of groups, but it would have devastating consequences for women and new mothers in particular. The bill defunds Planned Parenthood and slashes funding for Medicaid, which pays for roughly half of all births in America and provides family planning services to 13.5 million women. Ironically, Graham-Cassidy follows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All bill, which would provide universal health care as a right, and cover all women’s health services, including abortion. 
Sanders’ bill marked not only an impressive moral step forward for the Democratic Party (to argue that in the wealthiest country in the world, sickness and poverty should not be a death sentence is a surprisingly radical stance), but also a move to respect women’s bodily autonomy through pregnancy and maternity, and invest in their economic enfranchisement. This jarring 180-degree reversal in the Senate shows how our standards of living as women, like the standards of living for all marginalized people, are — for better or for worse — powerfully dictated by the choices of our lawmakers.
The potential for suffering, poverty and death from the dismantling or defunding of Obamacare underscores the lived consequences of politics. It shows that the ability to separate politics from one’s personal life is the epitome of privilege and that, in no uncertain terms, the personal is the political. Empathy and recognition that the absence of and need for social justice regardless of one’s personal experiences is another important driver of activism, and we certainly shouldn’t expect the only people fighting for health care to be the ones at risk of losing it. 
But while oppression exists on a wide spectrum, experiencing any form of it — from identity-based micro-aggressions to hate crimes — is life-changing. Our politics are shaped by our experiences. And it doesn’t necessarily take losing your health care and facing certain death to realize the inextricably personal nature of politics. 
As much of a women’s rights news junkie as I may be now, the conception of this column was born far more from 18 years’ worth of gender-based personal struggles than some arbitrary, detached interest in politics. As a 16-year-old high school student, I made the “choice” to become “political” about as much as I made the “choice” to routinely face sexual harassment, endure mental health and body image struggles, and — until very recently — face conflict after conflict with my parents about my behavior as a young woman.
From the clothes I wore to those most intimate aspects of my personal life that my male peers could partake in without fear of being subjected to traumatic verbal assault, my consciousness of the reach of patriarchal politics — beyond Capitol Hill to my suburban Bay Area high school — was born of my personal experiences. Granted, these experiences coincided with my AP United States History class, a course rife with lessons about our nation’s past that opened my eyes to lingering injustice. 
It was the same year as my first visit to my local Planned Parenthood — the same year an anti-choice gunman killed three at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado and extremists set a handful of clinics across the country on fire. And it was also the same year as some of the most high-profile, racially-charged police killings in our nation’s recent history: Mike Brown, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice. They were all their mothers’ babies, shot dead or brutalized to death, in the same year I was barely on speaking terms with my own mother, and I watched in disbelief as Republicans struggled to concede that the lives of those young black men did, in fact, matter. From that year onward, the part of me that had long filtered the expression of my beliefs and convictions, that had grit my teeth to force my silence on what I cared about, was utterly expunged. 
Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning and fight for what, to many onlookers, appear to be lost causes? I wish I could identify the reason as some noble, higher calling — a decision made not from urgency but from the goodness of our hearts. But in many cases outside of celebrity activism, the answer is that many activists don’t have a choice. So much of political activism is a war for survival — a war for the right to live in this country, to love and marry who we choose, to have decision-making power over our bodies, to not have to die because we can’t afford health care. 
In this political moment, activism is a war for the right to exist in a country built by slaves and, to this day, ruled by white men. And for people of marginalized identities, for people on the brink of losing their lives because of Obamacare repeal, activism — like being political — isn’t a choice.

You’re oppressed? I can guarantee you that in 100 years, China will be majority Chinese. In 100 years, Africa will be majority African and India/all of southwest Asia will have the same ethnic composition as today. But white countries, and only white countries, have been targeted by (((globalist))) forces for mass immigration and ethnic replacement.
You’re such a drama queen.  Existential threats, survival, oppression, controlling white men, pending death due to congressional adventurism, traumatic verbal assault, terrified constituencies, political targeting, die-ins, death from police brutality, et al.  My guess is that you realize that only another under-exposed student would take to heart your tripe.  You, among the totally unaffected, attending a prestigious university with prosperity and abundance in your future are a self-anointed fake social warrior in the extreme. You, madame, are a poser.
“In this political moment, activism is a war for the right to exist in a country built by slaves and, to this day, ruled by white men.” 
“Kylie Cheung is a sophomore majoring in journalism and political science.” 
Repetitive, tiresome content of this article aside, the most disappointing realization is that USC journalism is pumping out people for whom the height of critical thinking is writing politically-motivated, hand-wringing clickbait for the leftist echo chamber, and nothing more. How original. I am certain that every single “journalism” piece of this type convinces more people to vote to re-elect Trump.

Jessie Chang | Daily Trojan
As ambiguity around the status  of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program persists, nearly 800,000 young people in this country — at least 40 of whom attend USC, according to previous Daily Trojan reporting — are living in a state of uncertainty. And combined with the right wing’s dismal stance on public funding for education, the president’s threats against DACA mark a move to limit higher education access for people born into undocumented families. After all, to take away young people’s chances to live in America is to take away their chances to go to American colleges and enrich these schools with diversity. 
USC has a significant population of international students and a body of undocumented students, whom the University declared support for in a memo released earlier this month. The University addresses their unique needs with a number of resources., like waivers for DACA renewal fees for students. The Gould School of Law has a clinic that provides legal counsel and help filling out and submitting documents. The University also made a pledge last year to protect undocumented students’ identities from unwarranted government searches and inquiries. USC may not be a sanctuary campus by name, but the University nonetheless protects its undocumented students.
That being said, the issue of educational equity for undocumented students is not one that can be reliably expunged on an individual, school-by-school basis. This inequality — in terms of the hoops undocumented students must jump through and the anxiety they face about their right to go to school — cannot be removed on a national level no matter how many resources USC provides. 
The federal government must recognize how severely its policies and the rhetoric from its leaders have created institutionalized inequality in higher education, and ultimately make amends for this. Until this unfolds on a national level, equal education will continue to evade DREAMers at USC and across the country.
Education and equal opportunity are fundamental cornerstones of American democracy, which lawmakers are trying to use fine print and narrow, restrictive definitions of citizenship to deny thousands of young people from partaking in. The abilities of young undocumented people to pursue careers, support their families and pursue higher education may be up in the air throughout President Donald Trump’s presidency and Republicans’ hold on Congress. 
For these young undocumented people, anxiety about their futures in this country and its schools can certainly take its toll. On top of the mental health struggles that may inherently go hand-in-hand with concerns about one’s status in this country, legal fees for DACA renewal and hours spent at courts and clinics are just additional barriers to higher education for DREAMERs. Without DACA, American education is inherently unequal. 
While Trump seemed to soften his stance on DACA last week, making a tentative deal with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that would grant DACA recipients some conditional protection, his rhetoric and reassurance to his base shows he is firm in opposing immigration reform. A compromise with Pelosi and Schumer today does not negate a future of uncertainty for young undocumented people on college campuses.
The author says “Education and equal opportunity are fundamental cornerstones of American democracy, which lawmakers are trying to use fine print and narrow, restrictive definitions of citizenship to deny thousands of young people from partaking in.”
Fine print and narrow definitions of citizenship?  Either you are here legally or you are not.  The print is not fine at all.
No it wouldn’t since it is not the job of the United States to educate foreign nationals who were illegally smuggled in. Let Mexico  & Company educate their own kids.
Nice reporting Sara. Sadly,Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more thing that makes being an international student away from home difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Welcoming and assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   Something that might help anyone coming to the US is the award-winning worldwide book/ebook “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” Used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors, it identifies how “foreigners” have become successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest misguided voice!

Following a 3.6 magnitude earthquake in Westwood on Monday night, and a 7.1 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday afternoon that toppled buildings and claimed hundreds of lives in Mexico, earthquakes seem like a more pressing danger than ever. Researchers at the Southern California Earthquakes Center are actively investigating how and why earthquakes occur to better prepare Los Angeles for its next tremor.
SCEC, which is headquartered at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, comprises a collection of scientists and researchers from over 75 institutions and organizations from all around the world. Now in its fifth phase, the Center’s work is dictated by proposals from members of the SCEC community. The researchers involved in the international initiative convene at an annual meeting each September to present their recent work to be reviewed by their colleagues.
SCEC’s flagship project is an initiative named Cybershake. Jason Ballmann, the communications manager at SCEC, described Cybershake as an intense computational endeavor that compiles sets of earthquake data.
“[Cybershake] takes into account a lot of different types of scientific inputs, like looking at where the faults are, looking at the probabilities of those earthquakes happening, and also understanding what is happening within the earth’s crust,” Ballmann said. “What that means is specifically being able to know how fast or slow seismic waves can travel in various parts throughout the crust as defined by the California boundary.” 
Ballmann added that Cybershake is an important step in preparing California for its next major earthquake.
“The project takes all that data into consideration and then models different types of earthquake scenarios,” Ballmann said. “It lets us know what kind of shaking can occur, how hard it can shake and what way, so people like emergency managers, policymakers and design engineers can figure out how they can best make policy or design buildings.” 
Steven Goldfarb, senior coordinator of USC emergency planning and business continuity, explained the resources and response plan the University has instituted in case an earthquake occurs near the campus.
“The reality is that we have a whole department dedicated just to plan for this,” Goldfarb said. “There are things that a lot of people aren’t aware of, because there are so many elements to it.” 
Goldfarb outlined three phases of an earthquake scenario: planning, response and recovery. 
According to Goldfarb, USC’s preparedness plan includes building retrofitting and an extensive supply of emergency water, food, power and housing. The University also has a disaster medical plan in place in conjunction with Keck Medical Center and Engemann Student Health Center to provide emergency medical care.
The next phase of the response involves several USC emergency teams, including building emergency response teams to help evacuate building occupants and a campus emergency response team to perform disaster search and rescue, triage and first aid.
The Department of Public Safety is also trained to provide a first line of defense and emergency response in addition to surveying the campus in the event of an earthquake for damage. The Emergency Operations Center is responsible for coordinating response plans. Additionally, a team of medical professionals comprise the disaster mental health response team to provide stress relief services to students.
Protocols for recovery and continuity include departmental business continuity plans for schools and departments to continue their work offline, IT and financial disaster recovery plans and disaster waste management.

USC has participated in The Great Southern California ShakeOut every year since the its establishment in 2008. This year’s drill is scheduled for Oct. 19. Ballmann urges students and faculty to participate to learn more about proper earthquake protocol.
“For some people, [the -ShakeOut] can mean something as simple as doing a stop, drop, cover and hold-on drill,” Ballmann said. “It can also mean that you do much more. At USC, that means getting the faculty, staff and students notified ahead of time that they can participate at a time that works for them.” 
Ballmann also encourages students to establish a communication plan with their families.
“Your family members are going to want to try to call you after a disaster,” Ballmann said. “But cell towers are going to be overrun with many other calls that are trying to take place, and we need to reserve that data space for emergency responders. Your communication plan with your family should be digital — text or email based.” 
In addition to the ShakeOut, the University also has online resources available for its students. These include the USC emergency procedures video and emergency preparedness webpage.
SCEC and USC Fire Safety/Emergency Planning will co-host the Emergency Preparedness Fair on Thursday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in front of Bovard Auditorium to educate students and faculty on the importance of earthquake safety and building a disaster supply kit.
“We do know that we’re going to have earthquakes in the future, and we have to be prepared for them,” Ballmann said.

The Keck School of Medicine of USC is teaming up with two other universities — the University of California, Irvine and the California Institute of Technology — to develop a fully implantable brain-machine interface device that allows people with paraplegia to regain greater mobility. 
The initiative is funded by the National Science Foundation’s Cyber-Physical Systems Frontier five-year grant of $8 million.
The focal point of the research is to convert the existing technology into a version that is entirely implantable. The institutions will work together to create a  device that will transmit signals to a robotic exoskeleton that then sends the pulses to the brain.
 The project will require the skills of all three institutions to restore the sensation and walking ability of those with spinal cord injuries. Clinical studies will then be conducted on volunteers who have previously sustained spinal cord injuries.
“The restoration of walking is a very significant goal for patients after spinal cord injury,” said Charles Liu, the principal investigator at the Keck School of Medicine and director of the USC Neurorestoration Center told USC News. “New solutions are possible with the recent advances in neuroprosthetics and regenerative medicine.”
Liu’s co-principal investigators on the project are Richard Andersen, the James G. Boswell professor of neuroscience at Caltech; Zoran Nenadic, professor of biomedical engineering at UCI; and An Hang Do, assistant clinical professor of neurology at UCI. 
The long-standing collaboration between Liu and his colleagues at Caltech and UCI will be maintained through the USC Neurorestoration Center.
According to Nenadic, this study also aims to expand knowledge on the human brain’s control of walking and sensation that would give insight into how different diseases may affect mobility-related physical functions.
The Cyber-Physical Systems Frontier is one of the largest programs within the organization to provide financial support for scientific initiatives that integrate computation, networking and physical processes.

Just months after graduating from USC last spring with a bachelor’s degree in business administration, Michelle Wolzinger already has a startup under her belt. 
Before transferring to USC from George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Wolzinger was involved in a program called “Lemonade Day.” Participation in the program was required of every student to major in business administration. Its goal was to teach kids how to start their own businesses, culminating in a “Lemonade Day,” where each child would operate their own lemonade stand.
As a sophomore, Wolzinger noticed that the program did not exist at USC and took it upon herself to bring it to campus. Through the program, mentors from USC were able to visit local schools and teach kids how to start their own businesses. 
“I was inspired by working with these kids [my freshman year], Wolzinger said. So when I transferred and realized that there was no Lemonade Day program, I realized that it would be the perfect opportunity to create another connection between USC and the neighboring communities.”
Upon graduating, she decided to commit to this idea, building a website in two months and gathering all of the vendors to set their products up on her website. 
Her start-up, Radiant Roots, is a one-stop shop for all things related to sustainable beauty. 
“I am hoping that this is [where people can] find their products that they would normally buy in the drugstores because there are so many products that are horrible for your skin and filled with toxins,” Wolzinger said. “When you use 100 percent natural skincare ingredients, they are nurturing your skin and they make your skin radiate. I’ve seen a huge difference in myself and other people who use these products and want people to make the switch to be conscious consumers, and I’m hoping Radiant Roots can be a part of that movement.” 
If there’s anything a current USC student hears a lot, it’s about the Trojan Family. For Wolzinger, it’s no different. As a recent alumna, she’s had a lot of resources that have helped her along the way in launching her first business, including everything from programs like Blackstone LaunchPad, which is designed to support and mentor entrepreneurial students, to personal relationships with faculty and peers. 
“Some of my professors are like mentors now, still helping me in real time,” Wolzinger said. “They’re doing everything they can to help me work towards my goals. You can’t get that at any other school; the USC family is especially supportive. The Trojan Family is just so massive and important and incredibly impactful.”
As a young entrepreneur, Wolzinger has fresh advice for Marshall students, or any students seeking to start their own business. 
“Be awake,” Wolzinger said. “Be very active in your classes and your community because every single person sitting beside you is your network.”
To Wolzinger, the hardest part of entrepreneurship was simply starting out.
“A lot of people sit on ideas and don’t act on them and regret it later,” Wolzinger said. “You have unbelievable resources from USC right at your fingertips, and all you need to do is push yourself to start. Don’t do it alone, and use the advice from everyone around you to help you along the way.”
