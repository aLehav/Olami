The Pac-12 Conference has canceled the remainder of its men’s basketball tournament in addition to all other conference-wide competition due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Pac-12 announced in a statement Thursday. Shortly after, the NCAA announced that its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments as well as all other winter and spring championships had been canceled as well.
All other Power 5 conferences have also canceled their own tournaments.
“This decision has been made in consultation with our member universities in an effort to limit the spread of the virus and in the interest of the health and safety of our student-athletes, campus personnel, working and event personnel, and all those who attend Pac-12 events,” the Pac-12’s statement read.
USC’s men’s basketball team was scheduled to play Arizona in the quarterfinal of the Pac-12 Tournament hours after the statement was released. 
“We were all really looking forward to playing in the Pac-12 Tournament, but first and foremost, life is more important than basketball,” senior guard Jonah Mathews said per USC Men’s Basketball on Twitter. “We’re all wishing everybody the best of health and wellness around the country.”
USC Athletics had announced in a statement Tuesday that all intercollegiate athletic events on campus would continue as scheduled but without spectators except family until March 29. Now, however, all Pac-12 competition has been shut down.
“The conference and NCAA tournaments are the most exciting competitions of the year,” head coach Andy Enfield said per USC Men’s Basketball on Twitter. “We’re all disappointed that we can’t play for a Pac-12 title, but we are very understanding of the situation and know that this decision was made in the best interest of everybody.”
USC was expected to earn a berth in March Madness for the first time since 2017. The NCAA had announced Wednesday that its men’s and women’s March Madness tournaments would go on without spectators. However, Thursday afternoon, the organization pivoted. 
The tournaments will no longer take place, nor will any other NCAA championships.
“This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities,” the NCAA statement read.
The announcement also comes shortly after the NBA suspended its regular season for at least 30 days immediately after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive for coronavirus Wednesday night. The NHL also announced Thursday morning it is suspending its season. MLB has suspended Spring Training and delayed the start of its regular season by at least two weeks. MLS also suspended its season for 30 days.
USC announced a number of changes to the athletics department moving forward in a press release Thursday. All practices, camps, clinics, recruiting and recruiting-related travel have been suspended until further notice, and athletics department staff will work remotely through March 22, when the situation will be reassessed. 
The NCAA’s cancellations also apply to Mountain Pacific Sports Federation competition. 
“Our hearts ache for our student-athletes, coaches, alumni, fans, and all those affected throughout the world by the COVID-19 pandemic,” athletic director Mike Bohn said according to the release. “The health, safety, and well-being of our student-athletes is always at the forefront of everything we do. Therefore, our university and athletics department support the decisions made today by the NCAA and the Pac-12 Conference. These are unprecedented days for all of us. I have communicated to our student-athletes that we are here to support them however we can. Our Trojan Family will be stronger for having endured these challenges together.”

All USC-guided campus tours and admissions sessions have been canceled through April 14, Dean of Admission Tim Brunold confirmed to the Daily Trojan in an email Wednesday. Online programming will be available for newly admitted students before the enrollment commitment on May 1, Brunold said. 
The cancellation follows the University’s decision to cancel or postpone most USC-sponsored events on and off campus through the end of the first week after spring break. The period of remote instruction was extended by two weeks; however the University has not said how this will affect events.
“While we don’t like turning away visitors, there will be ample opportunity for prospective students to visit USC in the future — well in advance of the next cycle’s application deadlines,” Brunold said. “USC tours and campus visit programs are regularly offered year-round, and this temporary stoppage represents a relatively small percentage of our annual capacity.”
Admission ambassadors will continue to be employed during the period but will likely see a temporary reduction in hours due to reduced workload, Brunold said in the email. Students will continue to answer phones and perform administrative tasks.
While there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus at USC, the University will continue to monitor the situation as it develops across Los Angeles County and internationally. L.A. County reported the first coronavirus-related death Wednesday after confirming the first instance of community spread of the virus Monday. Last week, the county declared a public health emergency and the total number of confirmed cases has since risen to 29 at time of publication. 
As of now, USC campus tours and programmings are scheduled to resume April 14.

Students and faculty are managing how to transition classes online and navigate technological problems following the first day of remote instruction. Several classes encountered problems with class engagement, while others made the digital shift smoothly.
The three-day online trial period started Wednesday and incorporated virtual instruction through Blackboard and Zoom. Most laboratories and performance-based classes did not participate in the trial. In a campus-wide email, Provost Charles Zukoski announced online classes will continue through April 13. 
Anthropology professor Erin Moore usually conducts her lectures by incorporating group discussions and visual content, but hasn’t figured out how to do so while classes remain online. To prepare professors to teach classes digitally, she said USC provided one-on-one Zoom tutorials through USC Information Technology Services.
“The last few days, there’s been practically a place to learn Zoom every hour of the day, some place on campus,” Moore said. “[USC] flooded everyone with potential for learning.”
As of yet, she said she is not comfortable with the program but hopes to improve with each lesson. 
“I think that each time I do it, I’ll learn a few more of the features, and it’ll be less alien to me about how to use it and how to get back some of the intimacy in a classroom that you have that you don’t have over Zoom,” Moore said.
Josh Weadick, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering, said in his “Introduction to Digital Circuits” class, the professor opted to conduct class on Webex, another online conference platform, instead of Zoom. He said the professor had often used other educational programs to submit assignments instead of Blackboard.
“I’m in engineering, and most of our classes are lecture-based, so it was pretty much the same as being in lecture,” Weadick said. “I was expecting it to be a little more challenging to understand him and get his notes, but it was pretty much the same. It was actually a little nice because there’s a chat box that students were talking in while he was lecturing for clarifications from each other.”
Clara Miller, a junior majoring in design, said she had varying experiences with the platform depending on the professor leading the class. One professor conducted an exam on Zoom to accommodate student circumstances and provided exam documents on Blackboard in case students experienced internet connection difficulties. Another professor did not encourage enough interaction with students via the program, she said. 
“The [professor] did not [require students to have] cameras on … she didn’t have her own camera on, she’s just talking while the slides were on [Zoom],” Miller said. “It felt really easy to zone out or not listen … She didn’t make an effort to try to engage people.”
Although Miller said she believed her first day went smoothly, the online classes could not replace the in-person experience. 
“It’s a weird thing when you’re not like in the presence of someone,” Miller said. “You can’t always get your emotions across text, it’s even hard across the camera … It feels very one-sided.” 
Moore, who plans to work on learning new features on Zoom to incorporate an interactive setting with students, said the new setting will require students to be more responsible with their academics. 
“You can’t form the same kind of communities that you can in a classroom,” Moore said. “You’re less able to form and nurture a learning community … I think it also puts a lot of the onus on the students to start taking charge of their own education.”

The USC football team held its first spring practice Wednesday with the full squad at Howard Jones Field. It was the first of 15 sessions allowed by the NCAA between March and May. 
Four early enrollees made their debut alongside multiple new coaches, including defensive coordinator Todd Orlando and special teams coordinator Sean Snyder. One of USC’s two four-star recruits, wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr., ran routes with both sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis and recovering redshirt senior quarterback Matt Fink. With a starting offensive line that only lost Austin Jackson and a wide receiving corps that has plenty of young talent to fill the shoes of departed wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., expectations are high for the Air Raid offense’s production.
“It’s been an offense for a year now and we understand it for the most part,” junior wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown said. “But there’s always these little details we can focus on.”
St. Brown is one of several players recovering from an injury on head coach Clay Helton’s squad after an offseason sports hernia. Also out on offense — along with redshirt sophomore quarterback JT Daniels — are redshirt sophomore tailback Markese Stepp and sophomore wide receiver Munir McClain, who are not expected to take the field this spring. 
On the defensive side, junior safety Talanoa Hufanga spent Wednesday’s practice running drills on the side as he recovers from an offseason shoulder surgery. Hufanga and teammate redshirt junior safety Isaiah Pola-Mao will bear the leadership responsibilities as Orlando overhauls a defense that allowed 408.7 yards per game in the fall.
“We’re just trying to be the quarterback of the defense,” Hufanga said. “We really want to be back there. We want to be able to call the shots and help put our guys in the best position we can.”
Even without contact, Helton set a fast pace for his team to build on in the spring slate. Special teams took over the field both at the beginning of practice and before full 11-on-11 scrimmages, running through both kickoff and punt returns. 
One-on-one competition was heated in coverage drills with the young receivers going up against the defense in the end zone, as sophomore running back Kenan Christon brought the energy against coverage by Pola-Mao. 
Slovis participated in the full-field scrimmage but was under cautionary watch by Helton’s coaching staff and is currently limited to 150 reps per day after experiencing elbow strain in December’s Holiday Bowl loss to Iowa.  
The practice had been scheduled as private before Wednesday. However, due to the University’s decision to move students to online classes amid concerns of the spread of coronavirus, USC Athletics announced that further spring practices will be closed off to fans through March 29. 
It is unclear if Wednesday night’s announcement from the provost’s office suggesting that students do not return to campus until April 13 will affect players’ ability to return to spring practice after leaving for break. 
Fan attendance at the USC Spring Showcase, scheduled to be played at the Coliseum April 11, may also be at risk after the NCAA announced all national championship tournament games will be played without fan spectatorship. This will be the Trojan fan base’s only opportunity to see the squad before the team opens its official 2020 season in Arlington against Alabama.

The USC men’s basketball team will take on Arizona in Las Vegas Thursday in the Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinal. The Trojans, who earned a first-round bye, will battle the Wildcats after they beat Washington 77-70 Wednesday.
Thursday’s game will be played in a desolate, fan-less T-Mobile Arena. The NCAA announced Wednesday that March Madness will be closed to the public in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the Pac-12 followed suit hours later.
Like all conference tournaments, the Pac-12 Tournament is being played at a neutral site — but that has not normally stopped USC, Arizona and other basketball fans from traveling across the country for the action, until now.
“We were 15-2 at home this year and we were 8-1 in the league,” head coach Andy Enfield said per the Los Angeles Times. “I think if you look around the country, the home court means a huge advantage … There won’t be any advantage for any team. So the schools that usually draw a lot of fans … it will be a big difference.”
Regardless, the matchup between two All-Pac-12 First Team freshmen forwards Onyeka Okongwu for USC and Zeke Nnaji for Arizona will be watched closely, especially as Nnaji was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year over Okongwu Monday.
Nnaji recorded 11 points and nine rebounds against the Huskies Wednesday, but the Wildcats’ efforts were led by freshman guard Josh Green, who dropped 19 points on 50% shooting from the field. The performance helped Arizona set the stage for a rematch with USC after the two teams split the season series 1-1.
“We’re excited to advance and have a chance to play USC,” Arizona head coach Sean Miller said. “They’re a very good team.”
Meanwhile, the Trojans are coming off a wildly competitive win at Galen Center over crosstown rival UCLA capped off by a game-winning 3-pointer from senior guard Jonah Mathews. The Santa Monica native became USC’s all-time leader in 3-point field goals that afternoon as well.
Despite Enfield’s prior struggles in February and postseason play, USC has won at least one game in the past five Pac-12 Tournaments and will look to increase that number against Arizona. USC beat Arizona in last year’s tournament, but the Trojans’ win over the Wildcats was led by forward Bennie Boatwright and guard Derryck Thornton, neither of whom remain on USC’s roster.
The biggest question for USC, as it has been for the regular season, will be regarding its consistency on both ends of the floor. Players like Mathews and redshirt senior guard Daniel Utomi must continue to hit shots when it matters most, and the Trojans will need to improve their abysmal 41.7% free-throw percentage from the win over the Bruins, as there is a good chance the game will be closely contested in the final minutes.
USC will also need to rely on its leading scorer, shot-blocker and rebounder per game in Okongwu if it wants to strengthen its case for a higher seed in March Madness. Okongwu, who is averaging 16.2 points, 8.6 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game, has been USC’s anchor on offense and defense and is expected to play a huge role against the Wildcats on both ends of the floor.
USC will tip off against Arizona Thursday at 2:30 p.m. at T-Mobile Arena. The winner will go on to face the winner of No. 1-seeded Oregon and No. 8 Oregon State in a Friday semifinal matchup at 6 p.m.
