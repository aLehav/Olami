Forever.FREEDOM.Dreaming is the free debut mixtape by rapper, singer, producer and USC graduate Vin Villa (aka Melvin Villaver) available on online platforms this Friday. Vin Villa has collaborated with rappers such as Juicy J and Young Thug. The Long Beach native’s project is mostly self-produced and avoids being sample-heavy, which showcases Villa’s instrumentals. The second track, “Legendary”, has hints of J. Cole with a unique drum beat over the emcee’s musical aspirations to be a legend. Followers of Vin Villa will be familiar with certain tracks in a final version of lyrical content officially released, such as “Time”, a soulful song and “Vinny Gigante”, a powerful track outlining swagger through beat and lyrics. Vin Villa clearly has an ear for creative hit-making, as the melody in “FREEDOM (feat. SLR)” has an unorthodox horn loop that is bound to induce head-bobbing. Perhaps what is most refreshing for the academic emcee is his lyrical content, drawing upon his experiences and lifestyle growing up in a working-class family and being part of marginalized communities. Villa is Filipino, and offers insightful commentary on race in his life and society while interlocking it with entertaining beats. The Daily Trojan discussed the project with the artist. 
Daily Trojan: Who are your biggest inspirations for this mixtape and in hip-hop?
Vin Villa: I am inspired by the real Los Angeles. I’m talking about South Central, Inglewood, Watts, Compton, Gardena, and Long Beach. My biggest influences for this project are the Los Angeles uprisings. I was born on the day of the LA Riots in ’92 in Los Angeles, so I draw inspiration from the city post-riots. I draw inspiration from literature and academics I was exposed to at USC. The American Studies & Ethnicity department has a course called Black Music and the Political Imagination. These courses developed my radical imagination and opened my mind to create this project.
DT: Not many emcees can claim that they’re a graduate of a university of such a high standard as yourself. How do you think your education has influenced your music?
Vin Villa: I’m inspired by academics. We’ve heard emcees talk about how nerdy hip-hop is. I’m definitely one of those nerds. The way I grew up, not very many of my friends went on to pursue a collegiate education, whereas I looked at my education as a way out, as well as a chance to meet new people and develop my thoughts and creativity. USC is a big influence on me. I’m a hometown kid who got to go to his dream school, but it came a significant price. My parents are working-class, so I had to work hard to survive and thrive at ‘SC. I underachieved during high school so I had to transfer to ‘SC from community college. But I knew that being here would sharpen my skill set. So I really have no regrets. At this point, my music and my education are part and parcel of each other.
DT: Much of your mixtape is self-produced. How did you get involved in production?
VV: My mother enrolled me in piano lessons at a young age. Those skill sets translate well into MIDI-based computer software music production. I grew up loving artists that wrote, produced and composed original material, so that is what I strived to become. Producing wasn’t always a passion of mine. I was tired of asking for beats, and with the piano background, I took the initiative to develop my production skills. Now, I have a multi-dimensional skill set that separates my music. Everything is written, produced and performed by me with the exception of a few well-trusted collaborators.
DT: You’ve opened for artists like Juicy J and Young Thug. What advice can you give to aspiring performers to gain opportunities and visibility that you have obtained?
VV: Creating your stage show is a whole other monster. You’re only as good as your live show, and I went from being a studio-based musician to a confident live performer. I would advise performers to find a good booking agent who believes in your music and who can get you on stages. From the big name venues to low-end small stages, all performance venues count.
DT: What would you say sets your lyrical content apart from other hip-hop performers?
VV: We like to turn up, and we make music to turn up to… But I’m not the kind of artist who is going to glorify a superficial, wealth-obsessed lifestyle often heard in rap. I come from a working-class immigrant background. My parents sacrificed a lot just to raise me here in the States. So I make music with deeper meaning. It’s music about life. It’s music that is experimental but balanced, bending genres. You hear a variety of genres influencing each sound. It’s a combination of what I grew up listening to and where I grew up and who I grew up around.
DT: What themes or topics do you delve into most on this release?
VV: The project has taken on its own life as a complex metaphor. I like to call it a young man’s take on labor, race, class, sexual, gender and identity politics in 2016. The language of youth is present. How we talk, platforms we use, emotions we go through and paint a picture of a young person finding themselves. I talk about my dad losing his job, being Filipino and dark-skinned while growing up in a neighborhood that is influenced by black American and Latino cultures. I negotiated my identity, code switching between L.A. hood slang, Spanish, academic English and Tagalog. I talk about the social issues impacting the communities that I’m a part of, including race and relations with police. I open up about my joys, and I disclose my fears. It’s a thorough account of my life up to this point, growing up in L.A. post-L.A. riots and what that culture signifies to me and my generation.

On Wednesday evening, a dozen-odd volunteers gathered in the garden behind  Watt Hall to turn over the soil in a 15-foot square. That square will be a cornfield by the end of this summer. The soil-turning event marked the sweaty beginning of The Crop Project, a senior thesis by Roski School of Fine Arts student Crystal Liu, whose goal is to bring the USC community together through agriculture.
Liu’s project is something between a public art piece and an urban farm. She selected the plot of land and the crop herself, but volunteers will be involved at every stage in its cultivation, beginning with Wednesday’s event. Liu’s project brings the agricultural process back to its roots, inviting visitors to return to the site throughout the summer to tend to the cornfield and watch the plants grow. Liu plants to host regular educational workshops about growing and cooking corn. The next step is a corn planting event next week, where a guest speaker will give gardening tips for aspiring vegetable cultivators. 
The artist’s inspiration for The Crop Project came when she visited Taiwan last summer. While working at the National Museum of Prehistory in Taiwan, Liu learned about the island’s local millet culture. 
“Their music, food, dance, everything is embedded in their millet culture,” Liu said. “The group harvest is the most important festival they have. It’s like Christmas here.” Liu is planning a similar group harvest event for USC’s cornfield when the corn is mature.Liu believes that urbanites can learn from the agricultural way of life. 
“Because I’m a city girl, that [visit] was a huge moment for me, and I want to bring that to the city,” Liu said.
Education is at the heart of The Crop Project. Liu wants to bring the gardening specialists who provided the corn seed to speak on campus and connect The Crop Project with local urban farms. Liu notes that though corn is the most widely-grown crop in the United States, most people know very little about the agricultural process. A majority of the corn that is grown in the U.S. is processed into products like corn syrup and cereals, so Liu hopes that The Crop Project will remind participants that corn is a plant that requires care and investment.
Liu adds that corn is an important part of America’s cultural heritage and has been grown on the continent for more than a thousand years. 
“We eat food every day, but we don’t know how it’s grown,” Liu said. She says that learning to maintain a cornfield has led her to embrace a more proactive lifestyle. “I wake up at eight every morning to look at the field.” 
In the future, Liu hopes to expand The Crop Project to other locations and cities. She graduates next week, but will stay around campus to tend her cornfield and seek funding for future projects.
Anyone interested in participating in USC’s new cornfield is invited to next week’s planting event. The Crop Project will culminate in a group harvest in late July, where volunteers and community members will cook and eat the corn together.
Correction: This article previously Liu worked at the Taiwan National History Museum. He worked at the National Museum of Prehistory in Taiwan. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Last night, to avoid writing the final paper of my undergraduate career, I started calculating how much time I had spent in the Daily Trojan newsroom during my time at USC. We begin production at 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and routinely stay until almost midnight. On Sunday, we start at noon (brunch provided) and usually wrap up around five or six in the evening. That’s more than 30 hours a week, 15 weeks a semester. I stopped calculating after that.
When I tell people about the time I spend at the DT, their reactions are usually incredulous. “Why?” is the question I get asked the most. “Why would anybody do that?” It’s a fair question. For the DT I’ve sacrificed my grades (sorry Ma), my social life and — despite Arianna Huffington’s warnings — my sleep. But the reason I kept going back is that I’m not alone in doing so. 
It’s no secret that fewer students are reading the paper nowadays, but even fewer students know how it gets made. Every day, starting with blank InDesign templates and stories emailed in or shared via Google Docs, my staff and I produce a product 10,000 copies of which will be distributed on campus the following morning. It’s a collaborative effort involving dozens of students — reporters, photographers, designers, bloggers, artists, copy editors and editors — all of whom contribute their time and effort each day to creating this megaphone for the student voice.

As editor-in-chief, I get to have my name at the top of the masthead, but I’m really just a small part of a process that dates back to 1912 — and it’s a beautiful thing to be a part of. The paper has certainly evolved since it began more than 100 years ago, and will continue to. Just this semester, we launched on Apple News, introduced graphics and video to our social media platforms and created a new digital edition of our supplement issue, It Takes a Village. 
But the greatest part of the DT is timeless — it’s students coming together every day to create something together. We’re not perfect, we make our fair share of mistakes, but we do a lot of great work too. This semester we celebrated our men’s basketball team making the NCAA tournament, we shone a light on the issue of homelessness in Los Angeles and we called out the administration for its lack of transparency with tuition increases. We beat the Los Angeles Times on a story about faculty unionization efforts and The New York Times noted an opinion from our editorial board calling for a female athletic director. And we went to class — sometimes.
The best part of my job as editor was seeing my staff grow over the semester to the point where I realized that if I didn’t show up, they would be fine on their own. It was seeing eager freshmen on staff and knowing that the paper still has a bright future ahead of it. It was being part of something far greater than myself or any individual student. It was being part of a tradition of excellence that will continue long after I leave this campus. To those who ask why I did it, I say: I couldn’t have been anywhere else.
