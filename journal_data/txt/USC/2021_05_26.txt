When Annette Kim, associate professor of public policy, began seeing lease and closing signs displayed at local businesses, she was inspired to work with her students to preserve legacy businesses in certain Los Angeles neighborhoods like Little Tokyo and historically Black Santa Monica.
Every year, Kim teaches the “Urban Spatial Ethnography and Critical Cartography” course in the Sol Price School of Public Policy. In the class, students partner with community-based organizations and city departments to create projects to assist with cultural asset mapping, or collecting and analyzing information to describe a community’s cultural resources. This year, Kim instructed her students to focus their projects on L.A. legacy businesses — businesses that have been part of the city’s culture for decades. 
“Culture often is embodied in the small businesses,” Kim said. “A lot of times, people weren’t thinking of these businesses as culture bearers, but I think as they started being threatened, especially during the pandemic, people felt it would be a huge loss for the city. It’s part of what gives it its distinctive identities and so, the culture became supporting legacy businesses.”
Kim’s proposed solution to this problem was to make these businesses “more legible and easier to find, and [to] create content to show their value.” With this, she hopes that more people will want to visit them. 
For Lindsay Mulcahy, a graduate student studying heritage conservation and urban planning, Kim’s course was special. 
“[The course] was really all about different ways that people connect to place and how, really dissecting the physical landscape, through the lens of stories and visuals and data analysis, can give us a better understanding of what’s in a place and what makes it special to people,” Mulcahy said.
Mulcahy did her project for the course on Little Tokyo, highlighting its history and identity. She said that the projects are centered around people’s voices, their personal experiences and the history of the project’s chosen neighborhood.
“The project is all about getting to know people and getting to know a community that you’re not in,” Mulcahy said. “It’s also hard too because it’s about people’s stories and the cultural significance of these places, and then figuring out how to tie that to policy solutions is also difficult.” 
Anthony Gill, a 2021 graduate with a master’s degree in public policy, said that, for him, one of the best parts of taking the course was being able to tell stories that people may not know much about.
“Being in public policy … we don’t really get to do things that center stories and people in this type of way, and then that gets to put together a product that’s pretty cool and creative,” Gill said. “Just getting the experience to put something together that’s a little bit unique, and hopefully tells a story [people] may not know that much about … It’s cool to get to kind of share a little bit about that story.” 
Gill did his project on historical Black Santa Monica. When people think of Santa Monica, he said they think of the beach, shopping and the arts but not necessarily that there used to be a “really thriving Black community” there. 
According to Kim, there was a greater emphasis on archival research and data analysis this year than in previous ones. In previous years, Kim encouraged her students to visit the places they were researching and to talk to people in person, both of which were not possible during the pandemic. However, this limitation provided new outcomes for the students’ projects, as it drove them to dig deeper into the history of the areas they were working in.
“Surprisingly, I think we had some of our best projects,” Kim said. “I’ve heard I have a reputation that this is a hard class. I asked a lot, but the students usually rise to the occasion and do amazing things.” 
According to Caelan Rafferty, a 2021 graduate with a master’s degree in urban planning, instead of exploring the urban environment and interacting with the community in person, this year’s projects had to use previously made research, providing a “deeper understanding” of prior research.
Rafferty also did his project on Broadway business districts in Black Santa Monica, although he faced difficulties finding information on Black businesses. 
“It was really rewarding to be in Professor Kim’s class and to have the different perspectives as we were looking into alternative histories because it was focused on histories and narratives that are not generally recorded,” Rafferty said.
Kim said she hopes her course will teach students to get creative and gather data that they need to understand different places. 
“I think it’s been helpful for [marginalized groups and community based organizations] to see those communities valued, and put extra attention on,” Kim said. “Because a lot of times, that data can misrepresent them.”

USC’s Leslie and William McMorrow Neighborhood Academic Initiative is one of many organizations that had to adapt to a virtual platform during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The program focuses on creating a pathway to college for first generation students and has helped over 1,000 students since its foundation 24 years ago. For a majority of these students and their families, the shift to online programs posed a new challenge, as many face unstable internet connection in their homes or have difficulties with technological literacy. 
Ivonne Rodriguez, a project specialist at NAI who works directly with families, observed these problems first hand. She said that circumstances, such as living in multi-generational households where students may have difficulties finding a space to speak about themselves or their personal beliefs freely in their home, can pose challenges for students’ academic success in a virtual setting.
“We ask, sometimes, for students and families to turn on their cameras,” Rodriguez said. “Then you realize that the only space they have to do that is a little corner, or in a garage or outside if they are able to get a connection.” 
Families are also required to take part in the program. They must attend eight Family Development Institute sessions, where members of the initiative teach family members ways to create a healthy learning environment in their home for their students. Lizette Zarate, program director at NAI, calls the transition of this program to Zoom a “culture shock” for many in the community the initiative serves. 
“Even our parent component moved over to Zoom so you can imagine [we have been] helping our families who might not be comfortable on a computer, who might never have been on a computer, teaching them now how to access these weekly sessions,” Zarate said. 
The inequities expand beyond the classroom as well. Over the course of the past year, the initiative shifted to provide personal needs, like food and clothes, for their students’ and families’, even more than before the pandemic. 
“When COVID hit, some of the needs in the community just looked much different,” Rodriguez said. “They were exasperated … because of lack of employment, having to quarantine, all of these things.” 
Kim Thomas-Barrios, associate senior vice president of educational partnerships at NAI, said that in the last year, NAI has likely helped pay for more funerals than in the past 20 years. 
“We’ve had families who were completely overrun by [the coronavirus], where everyone was sick,” Thomas-Barrios said. “We had some parents who have passed away, many of whom were breadwinners because they were in the front lines and essential workers.” 
Despite the hardships, Thomas-Barrios is grateful that the initiative’s students have enough trust in the people in the program to seek their help in the midst of troubling circumstances.
“It is our duty and our honor to be able to hold hands with these families in such a trusted fashion so that we’re able to really ensure that these students are able to stay in the college pathway,” Thomas-Barrios said. 
The pandemic also inspired NAI to strengthen their partnership with the School of Social Work. In addition to previously established counseling services, the social work team launched initiatives such as “Wellness Wednesdays,” where students receive self-improvement tips through social media. The team also created a book club and an additional support group for both middle and high school students. 
“We’ve always had really tight communication with our constituents, but since the pandemic struck, we’ve been far more involved in what’s happening, making sure that our families and students have their needs met, whatever needs we can support,” Zarate said. “We’ve been able to step in, and we’ve really inserted ourselves into what’s going on.”
The transition toward greater technology use also prompted NAI to create an app for students and families. Now, each student can register for programming on their mobile device and easily find the Zoom link they need in one place.
“Out of adversity or necessity comes … invention,” Thomas-Barrios said. “[The pandemic] has made us really think deeper about how we can automate some of the functions of an online Saturday Academy program, while keeping the same kind of in-person feel.”
Additional changes and services are likely to be implemented throughout the coming years, Zarate said, even as NAI prepares for an eventual return to in-person learning. 
“We know [next year] will look different in some aspects,” Zarate said. “We’re okay with that because … we’ve had so many lessons this year that will allow us to be nimble to whatever limitations are presented to us.”

Shannon Sharpe and Julio Jones could very likely have changed the way rumors spread in professional sports, forever. In case you haven’t heard by now, the Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Jones is not happy with the franchise. The 10-year NFL veteran has spent his entire career in Atlanta, Ga., but rumors have circulated this entire offseason that Jones is looking to move to a championship contender. 
With speculation swirling for months, it seemed as if we’d never really know what was true, what was false and what Jones really wanted. That was until Shannon Sharpe stepped in. The Hall of Fame tight end and current co-host of Fox Sports’ “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed” called Jones on-air with his co-host Skip Bayless Monday to ask him if he really wanted to leave Atlanta.
Eliminating media speculation, leaks from agents and gossip from team executives, Sharpe spoke directly to the source in an unedited, unfiltered conversation about Jones’ career plans. The conversation was so casual, Sharpe and Jones even joked about ruling out the Dallas Cowboys as a potential destination because Jones wants to “win.” 
Cutting out the “middle” man, or woman, in these situations can change how athletes use members of the media. When an athlete expresses a desire to leave their current team, the information or “scoop” is usually linked to a reporter or TV host like Sharpe by any of the numerous parties involved. For various reasons, an agent, team executive or player could be motivated to leak rumors of unhappiness to the public. The situation itself is not unique. 
What is unique, however, is Sharpe and Jones’ decision to eliminate the leaks, rumors and inside information and discuss everything on live television. And yes, Jones was absolutely in on this. No producer would allow Sharpe to cold call Jones on air without Jones’ consent. Not only is it technically illegal in California, but it would ruin Sharpe’s reputation within the community of professional athletes. 
Long story short, Jones decided to use Sharpe’s show to say what he needed to say. Jones publicly said “I’m out of there,” to Sharpe when he was asked about potentially staying in Atlanta on the call. It doesn’t get more straightforward than that. 
Jones’ strategy of speaking directly to fans is becoming more common. Athletes are fed up with the media’s tendency to escalate situations, take quotes out of context and chase headlines. Instead of rolling the dice and giving information to reporters, who can in turn spin the information any way they choose, athletes are instead creating their own content and delivering their own “scoops.”
Now more than ever, athletes are at the front of their own stories. Sharpe’s decision to simply pick up the phone and speak directly to the source clarified the situation, which allowed Jones to say his side of the story and generated a massive amount of buzz on social media. The rumor was addressed, confirmed directly and everyone got clarity on the situation. 
There’s a good chance Jones just laid the blueprint for every other athlete who’s trying to figure out how to communicate what they feel without risking their words being twisted by the media.
Pioneered by LeBron James’ nationally televised free-agency hour-long special “The Decision” in 2010, athletes are starting to realize they can break news themselves. Gone are the days where an athlete needs a member of the media to get a specific story out there or create a certain narrative in the athlete’s favor. 
Athletes like James are creating their own platforms to control their own narratives. James created Uninterrupted, a brand where athletes like him can speak directly to a camera, clarifying any twists or turning points in their career, without having to ask a reporter to do it. 
Former New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter created “The Players’ Tribune” in 2014, a platform where athletes write their own stories under their own byline. Kobe Bryant used the Tribune to announce his retirement from the NBA in 2015.  
It’s not just the free agency, trade and retirement announcements that athletes are seizing control over. It’s everything. 
Athletes are live-streaming themselves playing video games, casually talking about non-sports -related topics with fans regularly. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer makes “behind the scenes” vlogs where he thoroughly explains his thought process before, during and after games.
Who wants to listen to a reporter vaguely summarize information when you can hear directly from Jones, James and Bauer themselves? 
The point being made here is sports media companies like ESPN, NFL Network and The Athletic as well as the reporters who work for them are going to be made increasingly obsolete if athletes continue to deliver breaking news directly to sports fans. “Insiders” in sports are in the business of getting as many scoops of information as possible. If these scoops stop coming in, serious changes will have to be made to the way these companies operate. 
How these insiders pivot and remain relevant will be intriguing. Will professional athletes start announcing their decisions live on ESPN, college-style with a table and three hats to choose from? 
All I know is that when athletes see how Jones was able to take control of his own narrative and combat misinformation, their patience for “insiders” and the game they play is going to diminish, quickly.

The No. 12 men’s tennis team ended their season Thursday after a 4-3 loss to No. 4 Texas in the NCAA Team Championship quarterfinals. The Trojans end their 2021 season with an overall record of 23-7. 
On courts one, two and three, the Trojans started with their doubles, which came down to a tiebreaker later in the matchups. Sophomore Stefan Dostanic and junior Bradley Frye set the tone early for the Trojans as they won their match 6-2. Texas would split the pair against junior Jake Sands and sophomore Ryder Jackson, who won 6-4. 
Court one was the deciding factor as the Trojans were up in the set until the Longhorns returned and got the doubles point from a 7-6(4) decision against senior Daniel Cukierman and redshirt senior Riley Smith. 
Looking to focus on singles play and redeem themselves, USC found themselves down early. 
Smith was defeated quickly by Longhorns No. 38 Micah Braswell in two sets — 6-4, 6-3. Sands put the first point on the board for the Trojans, winning in two sets after being down 0-3 in the first set to cap off the victory 6-4, 6-4 against Evin Mcdonald. 
At 2-1, the Trojans put their eyes toward their remaining courts to make it a close score as the matches would all end in three sets. 
No. 49 Cukierman won the first set of his intense battle against No. 23 Eliot Spirrizzi from Texas at 6-4. Cukierman would lose the second set 2-6 in a fiery third-set tiebreaker. Cukierman would leave no room for error in the tiebreaker as he finished the third set 6-1 to tie the score for the day at 2-2 for the Trojans. 
As the Trojans looked to take the lead for the day against the Longhorns, they found themselves down again. 
Freshman Lodewijk Weststrate lost in the three sets to Chih Chi Huang 6-2, 0-6, 6-3 to boost the margin for Texas to 3-2 as two more courts played to the end. 
No. 116 Dostanic gained some momentum for the Trojans with a win against No. 75 Siem Woldeab in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to tie the total tally at 3-3. Court four would determine who would win the matchup. 
Frye would give No. 108 Cleeve Harper everything he possibly could. He battled back to force a third set and had a tiebreaker on the last. However, it was not enough to beat Harper as Frye would lose to Harper 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. 
A back and forth battle resulted in a loss for the Trojans with Texas winning the matchup 4-3 and advanced to the NCAA semifinals. 
While USC’s season has come to an end, there were few players who had the chance to continue representing the Trojans. 
Cukierman and Smith, who both won their singles matches on Sunday played in the Round of 32 Monday.  While Smith lost in straight sets to No. 5 Valentin Vacherot, Cukierman excelled. Cukierman upset No. 37 Matej Vocel to advance to the Round of 16 where he fell in a close 6-4, 7-6 (5) match against No. 2 Daniel Rodrigues. Cukierman’s appearance in the Round of 16 marked the first time in his career.
Despite the losses, the doubles squad of Cukierman and Smith won their Round of 32 match Monday and their Round of 16 match Tuesday. They’ll play their quarterfinals match Wednesday.

A prosperous Track & Field season concluded last week with USC athletes earning impressive awards.
Senior sprinter TeeTee Terry was named Women’s Track Athlete of the Year and redshirt senior distance runner Isaiah Jewett was named Men’s Track Athlete of the Year, the conference announced last week. 
Terry won the Pac-12 100-meter sprint this season for the third time in a row and the 200-meter dash with a personal best time of 22.72. She is also a key member of USC’s 4×100-meter relay squad. A class of 2021 graduate, Terry graduated from USC as one of the greatest runners ever. Terry holds the USC record in the 100-meter dash and is ninth all-time on USC’s outdoor 200-meter dash list. 
Jewett concluded his career by winning the Pac-12 800-meter title for the second year in a row with a personal record of 1:45.16. His time moved him into second place on USC’s all-time list behind only Ibrahim Okash with a time of 1:44.92 in 1988. Jewett became the first Trojan to win the 800-meter dash in back-to-back years. 
Both Trojans had imperative roles in outstanding Pac-12 finishes. Women’s Track & Field won its third straight Pac-12 championship earlier this month, and the men’s team finished second. They’re also part of teams ranked No. 3 going into the NCAA West Preliminary Rounds next month. 
Outside of Terry and Jewett, head coach Caryl Smith Gilbert was named Women’s Coach of the Year for the third straight year and fifth all-time. Gilbert has coached the Trojans for eight years. During this time, USC has won 15 combined Pac-12 titles and 75 individual titles in seven Pac-12 Championships. 
This year’s women’s team put up 162.5 total points — the third highest in the program’s Pac-12 Championship history.

Only seven months after the 2020 Billboard Music Awards was postponed, the annual award show returned Sunday to honor the world’s finest music artists. 
Hosted by singer-songwriter and actor Nick Jonas, the event kicked off with DJ Khaled, H.E.R. and Migos performing “We Going Crazy,” accompanied by an exciting fanfare of trumpets. The live audience added fuel to the fire that was the performance. In contrast to last year’s show, a live audience was permitted at the outdoor venue, following appropriate coronavirus guidelines.
Singers Doja Cat and SZA proved themselves as multifaceted artists with their performance of “Kiss Me More.” Along with their stable vocals, the duo displayed their dance abilities with controlled and sharp movements. As always, they were in perfect harmony with each other, both vocally and choreographically.
Following both performances, singer-songwriter The Weeknd accepted the night’s first award, Top 100 Artist. He was nominated for 16 categories and won 10 — the most of any other nominee — a well-deserved accomplishment after being unfairly deprived of a single Grammy nomination this year. He ultimately took home the biggest win of the night for Top Artist.
The performances resumed with Twenty One Pilots singing “Shy Away” from their new album “Scaled And Icy.” Alicia Keys also sang a special, nostalgic medley of some of her biggest hits to celebrate the 20th anniversary of her debut album, “Songs in A Minor.” Other performers included pop trio AJR, English band Duran Duran, Latin singer-songwriter Karol G and Latin rapper Bad Bunny, with the latter winning four awards, including Top Latin Artist.
Other artists also took home major awards. Clad in a stunning golden dress, singer-songwriter Gabby Barrett won Top Country Female Artist and Top Country Song. Before the live broadcast began, she was also crowned the winner of Top Collaboration for her duet with Charlie Puth, earning Barrett three wins out of her nine nominations — the most nominations of this year’s female artists. Rappers DaBaby and Roddy Ricch’s “Rockstar” was awarded the Top Rap Song. 
Globally-renowned K-pop group BTS won Top Selling Song with “Dynamite,” beating out fierce competition from Cardi B’s “WAP” and Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage.” The song also beat The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights,” which later won Top 100 Song. Before the live broadcast, BTS won Top Song Sales Artist and Top Duo/Group, which they narrowly missed last year. The seven-member group was declared Top Social Artist for the fifth consecutive year.
In addition to winning all four of their nominations, BTS gave a debut performance of their second English song, “Butter,” which was released Friday. Unable to join the venue live, the group still did “pull [me] in like no other” from South Korea with full charisma and charm. The dance was as smooth as the song title, ushering groovy choreography of body rolls and glides across the floor, which perfectly tied in with the single’s playful and flirtatious vibes.
Singer-songwriter P!nk also joined the roster of performers. P!nk and her daughter Willow delivered a beautiful aerial dance of their mother-daughter duet “Cover Me in Sunshine.” P!nk’s guitarist then joined her for “All I Know so Far” before P!nk turned the stage upside down with a lightning mash-up of her most iconic songs, including “So What,” “Just Give Me a Reason” and “Get the Party Started.”
P!nk became the 10th artist to receive the Icon Award, while the late rapper Pop Smoke won five awards, one being Top Billboard 200 Album. His mother, Audrey Jackson, accepted the award on his behalf.
Though the BBMAs are usually intended to award top-charting music artists, the 2021 BBMAs highlighted artists’ important non-music contributions. Rapper and activist Trae tha Truth accepted the Change Maker Award, honored for his non-profit organization seeking to provide relief for those affected by natural disasters.
Songwriting duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis sang a tribute to Minneapolis, a “place that musically has always represented change to the status quo.” Joined by singer Ann Nesby, vocal ensemble Sounds of Blackness delivered a moving acapella rendition of “Optimistic,” a song that serves as an anthem for strength.
Many artists made their BBMAs debuts this year. During his acceptance speech for Top Rock Artist, singer-songwriter and rapper Machine Gun Kelly noted how this was his first time being invited to a big stage, despite releasing his first mixtape 15 years ago. British rock band Glass Animals, too, performed at the BBMAs for the first time.
Huge familiar faces also returned to the BBMAs. Singer-songwriter and rapper Drake received the Artist of the Decade award. With 27 wins, he now holds the record for most BBMAs. 
The Jonas Brothers returned to perform for the first time since 2019, joined by producer and DJ Marshmello, to perform their collaboration “Leave Before You Love Me.” They closed out the night with even more intensity with a medley of the JoBros’ hits.
Thanks to coronavirus vaccines, the 2021 BBMAs more closely resembled a “normal” spectacle than last year’s event. With the presence of a live audience, albeit masked-up and distanced outdoors, the energy and excitement remained high throughout the night. From Sounds of Blackness to BTS to Alicia Keys, each dynamic performance shined in their own ways. Though complete normalcy for awards shows is yet to be attainable, the 2021 BBMAs is one thrilling reminder that music can and should still be celebrated.

This review contains spoilers.
The first two seasons of “Master of None” were unlike most successful contemporary shows of its time. Episodes dedicated to the stories of older adults, filmed in black and white and spoken in Italian added to the eccentric and unconventional nature of the show. 
However, in season three, director Aziz Ansari takes both the plot and the aesthetic in a whole different direction. While the first two seasons centered on Ansari’s character, Dev, as he navigated through romance and his career, the third season focuses on Dev’s friend Denise (Lena Waithe) and her wife Alicia (Naomi Ackie) as they deal with the messy, brutal realities of marriage. 
It’s hard not to assume that one of the reasons for the switch in character focus is due to the sexual assault scandal involving Ansari back in 2018. However, he was never subject to the full cancellation some of his peers experienced, and Netflix has been more than happy to continue working with him.
The genius and beauty of this season lie in its subtlety. Due to unique cinematography choices, such as the smaller frame size and the grainy film quality, Season 3 feels more personal, as though it was filmed by an uncle obsessed with his new camcorder. In the first few episodes, the action rarely strays from Denise and Alicia’s stunning, antique house, with the narrative resting solely on the two characters as they talk, eat, dance and argue.
Dev, the star of the previous two seasons, makes only two brief appearances. We learn that Dev is having marriage issues and has moved back into his parent’s house, and the obvious hair thinning and general despondency will make viewers grateful for the shift in characters.
The decision to shift the focus onto Denise and Alicia’s relationship, whether out of necessity or not, proved to be wise and somewhat radical. Relationships between Black queer women are still relatively untouched when it comes to film and television, and yet, across these five episodes, their relationship is made to seem beautifully and exquisitely unextraordinary. 
Another reason for this season’s success was giving more significance to the genius that is Lena Waithe. Waithe has had a rising profile ever since her historic Emmy win as the first African American to win the outstanding writing for a comedy series category. She has since starred in multiple TV shows, written the critically acclaimed film “Queen & Slim” in 2019, and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ representation. 
Part of the beauty and intimacy of this season is how intimate and yet unremarkable the story is. 
This is real life in its truest form, accentuated by Ansari’s decision to take his sweet time by switching between shots. The awkward silences — the 10 seconds after someone leaves the room, the settling down after the music stops playing — is all there. There are two full minutes where we see Alicia just sitting miserably at the laundromat while an obnoxiously loud Latin song plays overhead. These are the moments that make this story seem more authentic than your run-of-the-mill romance. It’s not the grand gestures that are important but rather the small, forgotten details. 
Although this series of episodes is titled “Moments in Love,” the two characters spend more moments out of love than in it. As Denise and Alicia deal with differences in career success, miscarriage and infidelity, the illusion of the dancing-while-folding-laundry couple quickly disintegrates. After their separation, the focus shifts to Alicia as she deals with the hardships of trying to get pregnant as a single lesbian woman, and Naomi Ackie carries the role with a quietly gut-wrenching performance deserving of a standing ovation.
While this season is drastically different from the previous two, its intimacy and genuineness are what help make it “Master of None’s” best season yet. Despite a shift in characters and a mostly single-key location, this season satisfies the needs of both hopeless romantics and love skeptics. The indie, rustic vibe also adds to the quiet beauty that elevates this mini-series. In the season’s dying moments, Alicia asks Denise, “What’s wrong with being like everyone else?” To which Denise responds, “Everything.” It is clear from the start that the reason this third season is so remarkably touching is due to its pointedly unremarkable nature.

In an ever-evolving political climate, it can often be intimidating for young voters to seek out appropriate sources for political news.  
Enter Political Playlist, a new way for young voters to learn more about young politicians fighting for issues they are passionate about.
“We hope that the experience is one of discovery,” said Michael Kristoff. “That you get your playlist [and] you are discovering people that you’re not reading about in mainstream news sources and what we’re seeing on TV.”
Learning about politics in a safe space can make a massive difference in forming one’s opinion, and Political Playlist brings the next generation of young voters and politicians together through non-partisan conversations.
The founding members of Political Playlist, USC alumni Anthony Barkett, Anna Musky-Goldwyn and Michael Kristoff, are a real example of the power of the Trojan Family. While these three did not know one another as students, they immediately connected upon meeting due to their shared USC degree and mutual interest in politics. It wasn’t long after when they founded Political Playlist. 
Political Playlist is a website service that offers two unique experiences. An algorithmic tool on their website allows users to create their own “political playlist” by taking a survey to gauge which political issues they are passionate about. Based on those results, participants are sent an emailed newsletter with updates from young politicians, under 45, working on said issues. Since the group is non-partisan, it makes an effort to expose users to voices from both sides of the aisle.
“We want it all to be objective, we didn’t want to be like a scientist behind the scenes,” Musky-Goldwyn said. “We wanted …you to put in your answers, and there’s a math problem solving that as opposed to like the three of us … handpicking anything.” 
The second component is a podcast that allows audiences to delve into the intersectionality of politics and discover what they care about.
“This more kind of culturally focused conversation series is very specifically generated by what we find interesting and it’s much more curated,“ Musky-Goldwyn said. “To sort of give that discovery access point for people to say like, ‘Hey are you interested in fashion, we’re going to talk to a stylist about fashion in politics or, you know, are you interested in, tech, we’re going to talk to someone who does like tech in politics and so just kind of finding those, those connecting points, I think is more the point of the chat.”
Although new, Political Playlist has hosted many notable guests in politics and other sectors including Congresswoman Sara Jacobs and CEO of the nonprofit organization Thirst Project, Seth Maxwell. Additionally, the group was nominated for a Webby Award alongside the White House for the best government and civil innovation website.Each member attributes their deep passion for politics to their experiences at USC, both in and out of the classroom.
For example, founding member 2012 alumnus Barkett, a business administration major and International Relations minor, engrossed himself in foreign policy through an immersive experience with the International Relations program, Problems Without Passports.  
“[The program] gave you a menu and DC was Capitol Hill, NGOs, think tanks, so that helped sort of solidify a lot of the political landscape,” Barkett notes.
Gary Glass, a former professor of International Relations who led Problems Without Passports, added  that the success of his program was largely due to younger generations facing the futility of partisan gridlock.
“[Barkett] is smart, creative, insightful and was always very involved in national politics,” said Professor of International Relations Steven Lamy. “He was one of those students who was interesting to talk with and who [knew] who was running the country.”
For fellow founding member a USC alumnus Kristoff, his time at USC became more involved with learning about politics. 
“My political discovery began at USC when four other friends of mine and I started going out to dinner after every exam session,” Kristoff said. “It was kind of through those like fun, lively, engaging conversations that is sort of what sparked me to join these guys with one of the plan was to kind of create, how do we create a place where people can feel like it’s a fun, lively dinner to go to and talk about politics.”
Due to the pandemic, the in-person group conversations have been put on hold. Political Playlist still hosts virtual conversations through their social media platforms and hopes to transition these into real-life conversations. In fact, the pandemic offered a unique opportunity for people to realize the intersectionality between politics and daily life, said Musky-Goldwyn.
“I think that from the sort of mission of what we’re doing, it helps, because I think it made people understand how connected we all are to politics, even if we previously might have not thought that,” Musky-Goldwyn said. “You ask anyone who went on unemployment, it’s like, ‘Oh, so you should pay attention to politics right because like you’re getting an unemployment check, maybe for the first time in your life.’”
At its heart, the mission of Political Playlist is to provide a safe space to learn more about political issues without feeling reprimanded for current opinions. 
“I think the message is [that] you don’t have to change or sacrifice your beliefs to learn about what’s out there,” Musky-Goldwyn said. “And that educating yourself doesn’t mean that you’re becoming a different person or that you’re, you know, like betraying the people that you care about or the things that you care about.”

Tonatiuh Elizarraraz grew up listening to the stories of the people who frequented the beauty salon his mother worked at. He was constantly surrounded by people who were eager to talk about themselves, their lives and even their divorces as they sat back in chairs getting their hair done. 
Elizarraraz was fascinated. At the salon, his curiosity often led to his mother scolding him for being nosy. At home, he would spend hours developing original stories for his toys as he played with them in the bathtub. Consuming stories through television and film also provided Elizarraraz insight into how the world worked. 
His interest in the stories of others, television and film is part of the reason why he decided to become an actor. The other reason isn’t as heartwarming. 
“The joy part of [acting] came from wanting to belong and being around other people,” Elizarraraz said. “But I guess every story comes with the dark side, and, to me, a lot of it was I needed to learn to shift my behavior and belong as a means of survival.” 
Elizarraraz was bullied growing up, which led him to seek a sense of belonging through acting. However, along the way, he never forgot about his love for storytelling and how the world makes sense of itself through stories and language. As a professional actor, Tonatiuh understands that these narratives, as well as those who control them, can shape the world. 
“Culture changes much faster than politics,” Elizarraraz said. “If we can help control the agreements, or guide the agreements between us as society, and create a more tolerant and empathetic place that is just for everyone, then we can thus reflect that in politics and policy and law.” 
As an actor, Elizarraraz is a direct participant in the shifting of culture. The USC’s School of Dramatic Arts alum has appeared in many film and TV projects, such as two STARZ drama series “Vida,” and “Promised Land” and an ABC pilot currently in production. Tonatiuh’s road to success exemplifies his tenacity and laser focus on his values of empowering marginalized voices. Delving into the business aspect of Hollywood, Elizarraraz interned at a talent agency during his time at USC. Following graduation, the agency offered Elizarraraz a job, and he set his sights on becoming a part of the theatre community in Los Angeles. He hopped from gig to gig, making friends along the way. 
All the while, Elizarraraz remained focused on his commitment to storytelling. By not limiting himself to on-screen roles, Elizarraraz helps shape pivotal narratives through political work and conscious storytelling.
“I hope that the stories that I tell impacts people in such a way that liberates them,” Elizarraraz said. “But I also hope that the stories that I tell impact people in such a way that they take action.” Besides focusing on telling impactful and inspiring stories, Elizarraraz also works as a volunteer in organizations that effect change through protests, community outreach programs, and education.
“I have worked with Build Power and Black Lives Matter,” Elizarraraz said. “From being out on the field and protesting, helping them with their tech aspects, helping anywhere that I’m really needed.”
Elizarraraz also lends a hand to script writers by posing important questions about the framing of their stories and the way they represent different cultures. Addressing issues that range from colorism to accurate on-screen representations of communities of color, Elizarraraz helps with the intention of creating characters that provide more realistic representations of communities of color. 
In addition to giving advice to storytellers on developing their stories into conscious works of art that accurately represent marginalized communities, Elizarraraz also directly participates in work that aims to provide a voice to the voiceless, starring in two short plays from Chalk Repertory Theatre’s series “Chalk Lines.” Elizarraraz stars as Arturo in the play “Mutual Life,” which tells a narrative about the AIDS epidemic in 1992 around the historic West Adams area within Los Angeles. In “March of Time — Time Warp” viewers witness how the city of L.A. has evolved over the course of 150 years from Chinatown all the way to the Coliseum. 
Giovanni Adams, the writer of “Mutual Life,” is an actor, playwright and friend of Elizarraraz. Adams said when he was writing the play, he had Elizarraraz in mind for the role of Arturo.  
“And I just felt with Tona’s deep understanding of L.A. and his affiliation with the queer community here in Los Angeles, he would bring so much to the role, and I was not disappointed,” Adams said. “He has realized Arturo in a way that is such a marvel to watch as a playwright.” 
Adams lauds Elizarraraz as a great actor and said he was “not disappointed” with Elizarraraz’s work in “Mutual Life,” which will be available for viewing June 19. But, Adams didn’t only sing words of praise for Elizarraraz as an actor. He also praised him for being a great friend. 
“He has a great laugh, great sense of humor and a very, very sharp wit,” Adams said. “He’s a fiercely loyal, committed friend.”
USC alumna Jamie Lew is an artist who has created and designed art installations and theatrical sets for the likes of rock band Aerosmith and Disney Music Group. She met Elizarraraz at USC when she saw him performing in a play she worked on as a set designer. Her words of praise for Tonatiuh speak volumes about his character. Lew described him as charming and beautiful, with a strong political and moral voice. 
“I’ve learned a lot from him … to be non judgmental of different experiences of life,” Lew said. “And to be empathetic of different experiences of life.” 
As professionals, Lew said she and Elizarraraz have grown together. They have deep heart to hearts about their experiences with microaggressions and being used as an artist which makes them feel less lonely in their experiences. 
“People should know just how brave and powerful he is,” Lew said. “His success right now is only the beginning of what he is going to do and change in this world.”
When he isn’t on screen driving the narrative for conscious storytelling or volunteering in political organizations, Elizarraraz engages in all sorts of activities including, dancing, traveling, competing fiercely in game nights with his friends and holding intimate conversations with people about who they are. 
Tonatiuh is a person that has goals for their future but also the determination to accomplish them. 
“On the micro level, my goal for myself is to have enough money to provide for my family and to have financial freedom,” Elizarraraz said. “On the macro level, … my goal is to allow people to be seen, allow people to tell stories that empower them to grow.”

With summer rounding the corner, it’s always a pleasure to continue the conversation as we progress toward the in-person situation. To preface, this column primarily revolved around older adults and how ageist perspectives inherently degrade our understanding and appreciation for the aging process. We covered topics from careers in the aging field to how ageism affects our media consumption habits and everything in between. But, as cool, relevant and hip as it is to talk about a variety of topics relating to older adults, my column will be switching things up to cover some reflections and lessons learned by actual older adults I have met throughout my life. As someone who lacked cookie tins filled with knitting supplies or days spent with grandparents growing up, I often recommend going out to work or volunteer with older people (socially distanced with the right precautions, of course) and learn something new.
“Make the best out of the family you [have] because you’ll only realize what you miss once you’ve lost them.”
Today’s tidbit of advice comes in from an older woman who I met three years ago during community service rounds in my senior year of high school. Given that she was speaking pre-pandemic, her words also speak to the nature of graduation, seeing friends, partners or family members leave sacred Trojan ground for professional endeavors. 
This life lesson also speaks to the nature of the pandemic now that we are pushing onto a year and three months of quarantine. Many of us may have lost those friends, partners or family members set to don graduation robes in what was a tumultuous and traumatic time in our lives. A return to ‘normalcy’ for some begins this summer, and for others, that return may take a while to come around. However, the nature of the post-pandemic restoration gives us an opportunity to heal and grow from a period of loss and grief. This opportunity absolutely calls for us to truly appreciate what remains in our lives today. 
Maybe the pandemic gave you an opportunity to reflect on friendships and see who really stood by you when the world screeched to a halt. Maybe the pandemic provided you time to figure out what you wanted out of life, whether in terms of relationships or self-improvements. Maybe you took what was probably a well-needed social media break, considering that it always feels like a new problem pops up with every refresh. Maybe you just stopped and watched the whole thing go down. While now may seem like the time to figure out what is going to happen moving forward, do not forget those who got you through the whole mess in the first place — the friends, partners and family members.
For the folks making their return to campus in the Fall after spending only a handful of months on the stomping grounds, remember the relationships you had when you first started out. Also, know that it is totally OK to cry after not seeing your friends for a whole year. Go nuts. 
For the new folks, enjoy the campus when given the opportunity. Meet new people and be open to the changes that come your way.

USC Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards is responsible for upholding USC’s standards of behavior and integrity through disciplinary action. Standards include academic violations, such as plagiarism, and non-academic violations, such as hazing. In a survey sent out by the Daily Trojan, 31 students shared their personal experience with SJACS regarding academic violations. These responses come from all years and a variety of classes, showing a prominent pattern of concerning behavior by the institution. This alarming sample of responses warrants a closer look at SJACS’ practices. 
Unlike the United States justice system, SJACS requires no threshold of evidence for a trial. Professors have the power to make accusations with little to no evidence. For example, in Fall 2020, students were accused of cheating simply because they picked a multiple choice answer that could have been found on Google. 
Some professors, who do not take SJACS reports seriously, make accusations without much ground. In Spring 2021, one student talked to his professor after being accused of cheating and cleared all issues directly with the professor. However, two days later, the professor said he no longer believed the student and would file a report with SJACS. Professors are able to make these life-changing accusations on a whim with complete disregard as to how it might affect their students. Due to the nonexistent threshold of evidence, there have been cases where more than one-third of a class is sent to SJACS.
Following these accusations of academic dishonesty, involved students became understandably worried. SJACS only adds to this stress further by not communicating with students. Although it is University policy for the professor to tell the students about the situation before sending it to SJACS, many do not. Therefore, many students do not even know what they are accused of for months. In Fall 2020, one student sent dozens of emails to SJACS and the professor asking to see the accusation report to no avail. To this day, months later, the student only knows the details of his accusation from other students involved. Students are forced to go through the SJACS process blind with no support from the school.
Many are stuck in this clueless limbo for a very long time as SJACS cases can take up to a year. Besides mental health consequences, these long waits also have practical consequences. For instance, if the class in question is a prerequisite, students cannot plan their next semester without a verdict. Some classes are also required for internal transfers to other USC schools. If the class in question is needed for transfer, students may not know their admission decision for many months. Students do not know what their major is, what classes they should take or what career path they can pursue without a verdict. Leaving students with months of no communication is completely unfair. 
Due to the severity of the consequences and the long wait, many students are put under chronic stress — the prolonged and constant feeling of stress that often leads to mental and physical pain. Living every day in constant fear for nine months is detrimental to one’s mental health. The severe isolation, lack of support and lack of communication involved in the SJACS process lead to anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. Many wake up each morning with anxiety and go to sleep crying. Due to the sheer length of the wait, many students cannot enjoy their summer vacation. No one — guilty or innocent — deserves to go through this process. 
SJACS is no better during the actual trials either. Not only is there no evidence required for an accusation, but there is also no evidence needed to find students guilty. Instead of requiring professors to prove a student’s guilt, students are required to prove their innocence. SJACS automatically sees students as villains, and it is the students’ responsibility to overturn that. Evidence to prove innocence is extremely hard to attain, leading to many innocent students being found guilty. The consequences of these baseless verdicts go beyond failing a class. Failing a class may affect financial aid, leaving low-income students with no way to attend USC. Students considering medical, law or graduate school are also hit hard. Many students’ academic careers are ruined from these groundless verdicts. 
SJACS claims to uphold the Trojan values and integrity through disciplinary action. With students going through months-long extreme mental health crises from baseless accusations, SJACS has failed tremendously in its responsibility as a member of the Trojan family. 
SJACS, your actions have been evaluated and a verdict has been reached: you do not fit the Trojan standards of integrity and we demand a revolution of your practices.
