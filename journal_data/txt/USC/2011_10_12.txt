For decades, the Weekender has been a highlight of the USC football season, as students travel to Northern California to watch the Trojans take on the University of California, Berkeley or Stanford.
This year, however, the Weekender lost some attendees because the game against Cal is on a Thursday instead of the traditional Saturday. As a result, some students chose not to attend the Weekender because of Thursday and Friday classes.
Julia Kirchhofer, a sophomore majoring in history, said she would have headed up North if she didn’t have a test.
“I’m a huge football fan and I’ve been looking forward to the Weekender since the summer, but it lands on a Thursday and I’ve got a midterm,” Kirchhofer said. “It’s really unfortunate.”
Jon Vidar, an adjunct instructor of journalism, said he was holding a midterm for his photojournalism class today, despite the Weekender.
“I am a USC alum and I’ve [been] on the Weekender and really enjoyed it,” Vidar said. “But school should come first.”
Devon Graves, a senior majoring in philosophy, said he was looking forward to attending the Weekender for his first time, but cannot miss school for the game.
“It’s more of a ‘mid-weeker’ than a weekender,” Graves said. “I’ve never been to the Weekender and I was really looking forward to going this year because it’s my last year at USC. But, as much as I want to, I just can’t afford to miss class this week.”
Some students feel the Weekender is a valuable tradition that should be maintained, even if that means pulling all-nighters to write papers and cram for midterms.
Brittany Valiza, a senior majoring in communication, is flying to San Francisco just for the game and plans to return Friday morning.
“It’s a nice break to step away from academics and do something fun, but I do have midterms next week to study for,” Valiza said.
Kelly Austin, a junior majoring in communication, is excited to attend her first Weekender after transferring to USC, despite having to write two papers in advance.
“I’m so ready to finally see what the Weekender is all about,” Austin said. “I’m not going to let schoolwork stop me.”
Austin and her friends are taking a different approach and left Wednesday with plans to return Sunday, stretching the trip as far as they can.
“It’s not just about the game,” Austin said. “It’s about the social experience and having a blast. I’m sure I’ll be seeing the game, but probably in a bar; I don’t have a ticket.”
Regardless of whether students attend the Weekender for social reasons, the game or a combination of the two, finding a place to stay has been a challenge for many students because of a Nike Convention in Downtown San Francisco.
This year’s game against Cal will be played at AT&T Park because of renovations to Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. AT&T Park is closer to Downtown San Francisco than Berkeley, making it more difficult for students to find hotel rooms than in previous years.
“Forget the hotels,” Austin said. “We’re staying at a friend’s place in Berkeley and saving a boatload of money too.”

The USC Catholic Center is experiencing a decrease in Mass attendance without a permanent structure on campus, but an increase in attendees at its events.
Construction · The Catholic Center, on Hoover Street, has been under construction since October 2010. Masses are currently held in a classroom in Grace Ford Salvatori Hall. - Victoria Gu | Daily Trojan
Mass, which was previously held in the old Catholic Center on Hoover Street, is now being held weekly in a classroom in Grace Ford Salvatori Hall.
“Mass attendance is down because it is [at the] far end of campus,” said Father Lawrence Seyer, pastor at the Catholic Center. “We are pretty sure it will bounce back.”
Some students said although the Catholic Center does not currently have a permanent home, it still has an important presence on campus.
“Social events still have great turnouts because the people a part of the Catholic Center are very outgoing and friendly so it motivates people to come out,” said Catholic Center Liturgy Coordinator Joy Phan.
Students walking by the corner of 32nd Street and Hoover Street can see the progress of the new Catholic Center. The center will include a new European limestone-designed church that will seat up to 350, a community center, outdoor courtyard and an events plaza.
Regardless of the location, some students still regularly attend Mass, and are looking forward to the opening of the new Catholic Center.
“I still go to Mass every Sunday,” said Anita Dukart, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. “I can’t wait to see what the new Catholic Center looks like. I think it’s going to bring a lot of people together into one positive community.”
Seyer feels the upgrade will expand the possibilities for the Catholic population to come together and better serve the community.
“I’ve noticed the difference,” Seyer said. “Whereas before when I talked with someone I’d say ,‘that church on Hoover’ and they wouldn’t know what I’m talking about.”
The Catholic Center plans to continue steady promotion of social and religious events at the center and cater to its growing Catholic population.
“We just need to spread the word since we don’t have a recognizable building,” Seyer said. “We are pretty sure it will bounce back.”
Thank YOU for clarifying that, Natalie.
I would really like to know where Catholics going to this church will be able to P A R K …..?
Without a Parking Structure, it sure makes scrambling for a parking spot, before Mass, a stressful time…maybe that’s why people won’t come?
I’m on the Catholic Center leadership team, and I’d just like to point out that mass is actually held in SAL (the Salvatori Computer Science Center), not GFS.

USC women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin sits in his office and talks. He talks about his team, about injuries and bad luck, about life in general. He would talk about his squad’s season, but as he said, “Where to even start?”
Plugging away · Despite a nagging knee injury, senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge leads the Women of Troy in goals and assists this year. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
After being swept in the Bay Area last weekend, the Women of Troy (3-11, 0-5) are guaranteed their first losing season since the first year of the program in 1993. For Khosroshahin, it will be his first losing season in his 11 years as a Division-I coach.
“It’s hard,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s disappointing. We’ve dealt with it the best we can. We try to keep our focus on improving every day.”
USC travels to Seattle to take on Washington on Friday night. The Huskies (6-5-3, 2-2-1) got their first Pac-12 wins of the season last weekend by sweeping Colorado and Utah. There are now just two teams in the Pac-12 without a conference victory; USC is one of them.
“I hate this,” Khosroshahin said of his team’s struggles. “I hate every loss. Whether we lose 1-0 after outplaying No. 4 Oklahoma State or get destroyed by No. 1 Stanford. They’re all the same: terrible.”
Much of the squads’ struggles have come from injuries. Ten players have missed time, many of whom are scholarship athletes.
“I hate making excuses,” Khosroshahin insists. “And I’m not, because the bottom line is you gotta be competitive. But you take away that many players from any team, you’re gonna struggle.”
The team’s struggles, however,  have been overshadowed by some noteworthy individual performances.
Senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge has been struggling with a knee injury for most of the season, and Khosroshahin raves about how she has battled through it.
“Write about Brittany Kerridge,” Khosroshahin said. “That girl is a warrior. A warrior.”
Kerridge leads USC in assists with five and in goals with three, a statistic revealing in and of itself. The Women of Troy have been outscored 15-26 this year. They rank 10th in the conference in goals per game at 1.07 and 11th in goals allowed at 1.86. They have committed the second-most fouls in the conference, averaging more than 11 per game.
“Set pieces have been a killer for us,” Khosroshahin said. “Last week against Cal we dominated the first half. We told the girls at halftime, ‘The only way we’re gonna lose is if we give up set pieces.’ Bang. They score both their goals on corner kicks.”
The Women of Troy are used to having games count toward their run at a conference or even national title. Under Khosroshahin, they have made the NCAA tournament the last three years and won the program’s first championship in 2007. Now, they’re just playing for themselves.
“Every game is a chance for us to get better,” Khosroshahin said. “So we’re going to use them.”

After two weeks off from racing, the USC cross country team will take on five other schools at this weekend’s Northridge Invitational. This race will be the first time this season the Women of Troy run a 6-kilometer distance.
In addition to meet host Cal State Northridge, USC will compete alongside UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal State Bakersfield. The course, recently moved from a local park in Northridge, Calif., to the Cal State Northridge campus, is a flat, fast course that will play to many of USC’s strengths. Eleven of the team’s runners will compete this weekend.
“All of the girls have made big improvements in the last four weeks, so it’s hard to single out one person that I expect to run fast,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “My main goal is to win the team title, but we will have to run fast and be aggressive if we want to win that team trophy.”
The few extra weeks of training bode well for USC, particularly in a distance many runners are not accustomed to. The team has been running well during its rigorous training, and Walsh is optimistic about its performance.
“The team dynamic has changed some,” Walsh said. “The freshmen know that they are expected to contribute right now, and the older girls know that I expect them to step up and lead. The good news about the freshmen is that all six girls keep improving each week.”
This meet carries extra significance as well — it will help Walsh select his runners for the Pac-12 championships on Oct. 29, another 6-kilometer race. The pressure of this selection process will affect how the runners race.
“Only two spots [of seven] are secured, and we have 10 people battling for those final five spots,” Walsh said. “The race on Saturday will carry a lot of weight in determining those remaining five spots because the race is 6-kilometer, and also because I want to see who can run fast under pressure.”
The meet begins Saturday.

The USC women’s golf team, coming off an eighth-place finish at the Mason Rudolph Fall Preview in Nashville, Tenn., looks to notch its first tournament win as it competes in the Stanford Invitational this weekend in Palo Alto, Calif. The tournament, held Friday through Sunday at Stanford Golf Course, features 16 teams, including crosstown rival and Fall Preview winner UCLA.
The Women of Troy started strong to open the season, finishing tied for first after the first day of play in the Fall Preview tournament. The squad, however, struggled to maintain the first-day performance, eventually slipping to eighth place with an overall score of 24-over 888, 15 strokes behind the Bruins.

USC was spearheaded by the efforts of senior Lisa McCloskey and sophomore Sophia Popov. Both channeled strong starts into dual eighth-place finishes at 2-over 218, six strokes off the lead. Sophomore Rachel Morris, who struggled to a score of 80 on the tournament’s first day, rebounded nicely to finish tied for 52nd at 13-over 229. Highly touted freshman Kristen Park debuted with a solid 73 on the opening day and finished tied for 57th at 14-over 230, and senior Inah Park finished 15-over 231 and tied for 62nd.
The three-week break between tournaments has served as a boon for the Women of Troy, who used the downtime to practice extensively for the upcoming tournament. Though the results were disappointing, confidence has not been shattered by the team’s performance in the Fall Preview.
“We didn’t play well as a team, and we didn’t get the results we wanted,” Popov said. “However, we have been working hard in practice to improve upon our weaknesses, and we feel that it should pay off this weekend.”
As Popov noted, the main focus heading into the tournament is consistency. The team recorded a strong start and built an early lead in the Fall Preview, but faltered in the succeeding rounds. The second round was especially troublesome, as only Morris (80 to 75) saw a score improvement from the first round.
This, however, doesn’t faze the Women of Troy.
“We’ve had so much time to practice, and we’ve all worked to add consistency to our individual games,” Popov said. “Also, we have confidence in ourselves as a team. We’re returning four players and have two great freshmen, so our expectations are obviously high. However, we know what we’re capable of, and after our strong season last year, we know that we have the ability to do well and hopefully we can get some tournament wins.”

As a result of its current eight-match win streak, the USC women’s volleyball team has climbed to the top of the Pac-12 standings.
After consecutive road trips, No. 3 USC (13-3, 8-1) returns home to the friendly confines of the Galen Center for two straight weekends.
“It’s always better to be at home,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “But we can’t relax. It’s where you finish at the end of the conference schedule that’s most important.”

For the first time since 2002, USC didn’t play a single home match during the non-conference schedule, as it had to play six of its first nine conference matches on the road.
Since they won all six road matches, the Women of Troy have given themselves the chance to defend their first-place Pac-12 standing where they want to — at home.
“We’re taking care of business right now,” Haley said. “We just have to keep our intensity and stay together.”
On Friday, USC will take on No. 16 Oregon, which was swept by California last weekend before falling in four sets to Stanford.
“While they didn’t fare well this weekend, they are a very good team,” Haley said. “We know they can score, so we’re going to have to defend really well.”
The Ducks (12-4, 5-3) feature  junior outside hitter Alaina Bergsma, who ranks second in the Pac-12 in kills per set (4.83 kps), and sophomore setter Lauren Plum, who ranks second in the Pac-12 with 11.70 assists per set.
“[Plum] really throws it around in a fast system, and Bergsma has been unstoppable,” Haley said. “[Bergsma] is name of the game for them. If she can carry a heavy load, they can play really well.”
Both USC and Oregon played Minnesota and Penn State to start their seasons in the AVCA Showcase, with varying results against both teams.
USC beat Minnesota in five sets while losing to Penn State in five, and Oregon lost to Minnesota in five sets but beat Penn State in four.
The Women of Troy have won their last five matches against Oregon, and haven’t lost to the Ducks at home since 1990.
USC will then face Oregon State on Saturday night, in a match that could potentially be the squad’s 10th straight win.
The Beavers (11-7, 3-5) have lost their last four matches, including consecutive four-set losses at home last weekend to Cal and Stanford.
But the squad doesn’t have any jitters about playing on the road; it has a 4-2 record when it plays away from its home arena in Corvallis.
“They’re flying under the radar, and playing better than people know,” Haley said. “They have a different system [than Oregon], it’ll be difficult to plan for them.”
Oregon State’s offense has struggled this year, as the Beavers rank 10th in the Pac-12 in hitting percentage (.188), ninth in assists (11.23 aps) and ninth in kills (12.27 kps).
But the Beavers have showed some fight on defense, as they are fourth in the Pac-12 in digs (15.49 digs per set), sixth in blocks (2.49 digs per set) and fifth in opponent hitting percentage (.174).
“They’re a much improved, more athletic team [from last year],” Haley said. “They have some young players that are playing really well.”
The Women of Troy have also won their last five matches against the Beavers, and haven’t fallen at home to them since 1996.
Though USC has matched the 2003 national championship squad with seven consecutive conference wins, Haley thinks the team has to improve in fundamental areas to get to the level of that championship squad.
“The difference between those two teams is that [the 2003 team] played really outstanding defense,” Haley said. “We’re not as good as that team yet, but we could be changing that by the end of the year.”
Both matches against the Oregon teams start at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Three Trojans from the No. 1 USC men’s tennis will have another swing at a national singles title at the Battle in the Bay Classic today through Sunday in San Francisco.
No. 66 sophomore Emilio Gomez and freshmen Eric Johnson and Jonny Wang will represent USC.
Undefeated · Sophomore Emilio Gomez, an All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention last year, looks to keep his singles win streak alive this season. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The three will participate in a 32-player singles field, and Gomez and Johnson will also pair up in a 16-team doubles bracket.
The competition, hosted by the University of San Francisco, begins today at 9 a.m. at the California Tennis Club. Singles and doubles play will run until Sunday, with the doubles final beginning at 10 a.m., followed by the singles final at 2:30 p.m.
Last year at the Battle in the Bay Classic, USC sophomore No. 15 Ray Sarmiento took home a singles title after dispatching four consecutive opponents in a 16-player draw.
Despite an opportunity to defend his title, Sarmiento will not participate after reaching the consolation quarterfinals at the Men’s All-American Championships in Tulsa, Okla., last week.
Despite Sarmiento’s accomplishments last year, the players feel little pressure to defend his title.
“I just really want to go in and work on things that coaches have wanted me to do,” Johnson said. “Feeling better and getting some good matches in is my main goal.”
Wang has a similar mentality.
“I don’t really feel any pressure at all,” Wang said. “I just want to do my best and see where that takes me.”
Gomez, a native Ecuadorian, hopes to continue his undefeated singles run after going 3-0 at the Fall Chowder Fest in Cambridge, Mass., last month, while the freshmen are ready for additional collegiate experience after their efforts at the Fresno State Bulldog Classic in early October. Johnson reached the quarterfinals of the main singles draw, while Wang battled to the semifinals in the Flight B singles bracket.
The various fall tournaments provide opportunities for USC’s veterans and newcomers to hone their skills for the upcoming spring season.
“I’ve been working on my serve a lot, being aggressive and trying to move forward,” Johnson said. “All of those combined are really important for my game to be successful.”
Along with preseason practice, the Battle in the Bay Classic will offer USC an early conference preview of fellow Pac-12 schools. Players from No. 7 Stanford and No. 14 Cal, including Cal junior Riki McLachlan, who reached the semifinals of the tournament last year, will compete.
After the Battle in the Bay, USC will participate in just four more tournaments before kicking off the Intercollegiate Tennis Association season in January.

The No. 4 USC water polo team isn’t accustomed to not being at the top of the water polo food chain.
With the desire to get back to their former No. 1 standing, the Trojans (11-2, 2-0) head to Berkeley, Calif., this weekend to face the No. 2 Golden Bears (14-2, 2-0).
Despite the recent setbacks, however, senior driver Peter Kurzeka is optimistic about the Trojans’ performance thus far.

“I feel we have progressed since our two losses in the SoCal tournament,” Kurzeka said. “Our defense has been improving; we have been keeping with our goal of holding other teams to four goals. Offensively, we are putting up good numbers; however, we need to finish so that in the fourth quarter we either have the lead or our confidence is up.”
Last weekend, 10 different Trojans scored in the game against Loyola Marymount University — and one of those players was freshman driver Kostas Genidounias. For the year, Genidounias has already notched 19 goals. The native Greek scored a hat trick in the game against LMU, and is one of the younger players to watch, according to Kurzeka.
“Kostas is one of the best players in the country,” Kurzeka said. “He has gotten adjusted to the way American water polo is played. It’s a lot in the beginning and I think he will gain his confidence as the season keeps going.”
Though USC’s offense might be getting all the attention, its defense has stepped up as well, allowing just six goals in the last two games. The three goals LMU scored were on power plays, thanks to USC exclusion penalties.
Senior goalie Joel Dennerley stressed the importance of collectively playing as a unit on the defensive end this weekend to slow down Cal’s offensive attack.
“We really tried to play a bit more team defense for sure [against LMU],” Dennerley said. “This weekend we will need to continue that. Cal has multiple offensive threats and to play them one-on-one will be a tough task, so to play well we will have to have a good team defense.”
Though the Trojan defense might be holding down their opponents thus far, the Golden Bears offense will be a formidable challenge for them, regardless.
“Cal, offensively, is strong across the board,” Dennerley said. “They’ve got great outside shooters, counter attack players, their 6-on-5 is unstoppable almost. They’re really dangerous in almost every area so we are going to have to pick up our game again this week.”
Among California’s most formidable players is senior Ivan Rackov, who led the 2010 Golden Bears and the MPSF with 79 goals in 27 matches. Even after an incident occurred in the pool last year between Rackov and Dennerley, USC is not rattled by the prospect of facing him again.
“To each their own,” Kurzeka said. “It’s not a big deal; we are going to play our game without worrying about what he is doing.”
Saturday’s game against Cal will begin at 2 p.m. at Spieker Aquatics Complex. It will be a rematch of last year’s NCAA title match, when the Trojans defeated the Bears, 12-10, in overtime.

With thousands of USC fans making the dedicated pilgrimage to San Francisco today to watch the Trojans take on the California Golden Bears, everyone’s hoping the team doesn’t put up a stinker.
In fact, this one’s a must-win for USC to salvage some pride, exert dominance and satisfy hordes of fans who accompany the team upstate.
Why is this one so important?
Well, it’s USC’s first rivalry game as a member of the Pac-12. It’s the Weekender. And USC hasn’t lost to Cal since 2003, when it took the Bears three overtimes to down the Trojans 34-31.
It’s also one of the two teams of merit that USC has handled in the Matt Barkley era — along with UCLA.
Many were upset the game is on a Thursday, when it’s inconvenient for a lot of students and alumni to make the trek. But the game will get a lot more attention this way.
It won’t be buried on a Saturday afternoon between Verne Lundquist slobbering over some SEC team and a blowout Big XII game. It’ll be primetime tonight on ESPN; the only other notable game scheduled is a showdown between San Diego State and Air Force.
On national television, it’ll be a great opportunity for USC to put on a jaw-dropping spectacle.
Cal is not a very good football team. It won its first three games against sub-.500 teams this season before dropping its first two conference games (the game against Colorado didn’t count against the conference record) to Washington and Oregon, which it tried to defend with the same strategy that nearly took down the Ducks last year.
The Golden Bears played man coverage with a quarterback spy on every play for the second straight year. The issue with that this year is simple: Darron Thomas doesn’t run the ball anymore.
So the Bears wasted a man in run and pass coverage focused on a quarterback who barely left the pocket.
This is why USC has to win. It’s playing a not-so-good team on a big stage with the toughest tests of the season yet to come.
Losing on the road at Cal would drain all momentum from this young team and spell certain doom against the likes of Stanford and Oregon — if it’s not certain already.
The loss would also deal a serious blow to USC’s street cred in the Northern California-Southern California showdown. Pat Haden and others went to great lengths to make sure USC’s rivalry games were preserved in the reorganization of the conference. But the Trojans have lost their last two games to Stanford. If they drop the Weekender to Cal this year, there will be an awful lot of egg on some important peoples’ faces.
Just as boxers hate to lose fights they lobbied for, you never want to lose a game you fought hard to make happen.
Sure, USC will eventually lose to Stanford or Cal. But to lose in the first year of the Pac-12 Weekender in enemy territory? That would be bad.
But just how easy will it be for USC?
That remains to be seen. Cal’s weak point on defense seems to be its run containment after it surrendered 365 rush yards to Oregon (although Oregon torches basically everyone on the ground).
USC’s run game has been mediocre. Figure Cal will expect Barkley to throw 40 to 50 passes and do its best to neutralize sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, a charge easier planned than executed.
Nevertheless, someone will need to have an effect on the ground or Cal will capitalize on the one-dimensional offense. Whether it’s senior tailback Marc Tyler, junior Curtis McNeal or redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan, someone’s going to have to step up and turn carries into yards.
And don’t think USC will hold Cal to 15 points this game. Quarterback Zach Maynard is no Nick Foles, but USC’s inability to cover underneath routes and its tendency to miss key tackles will give Cal a chance on offense it doesn’t really deserve.
And no coach has seen USC more than California coach Jeff Tedford, who has run the Golden Bears’ football program since 2002 — that makes him the longest-tenured coach in the conference.
USC should hope the special teams remain as solid as they have been up to this point to give some leeway for the offense and defense to screw up once or twice.
There’s a reason USC is only favored by three points in this game, and it’s not because USC can’t execute. It’s because USC is terribly inconsistent and largely unable to put together strong offensive and defensive showings within the same game.
The last time USC went into AT&T Park was to play its 2009 Emerald Bowl game against Boston College; it came away with an easy victory.
USC needs to win against Cal — or else it’s going to be a long ride home and a long rest of the season.

A season ago, USC disposed of California — almost seamlessly.
The Trojans compiled 602 yards of total offense. Quarterback Matt Barkley, then a sophomore, threw five touchdown passes — a single-game school record. Perhaps most impressively, they led 42-0 at halftime en route to a 34-point victory over the Golden Bears.
“That day everything went right for us,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of the win, which snapped a two-game losing skid. “It was just one of those better days and that happens in football where everything goes right for you and everything goes wrong for them.”
Making his mark · Last year, junior quarterback Matt Barkley tossed five touchdown passes against California in a 48-14 win. Through five games in 2011, he has thrown 14 touchdowns compared with four interceptions. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Under coach Jeff Tedford, Cal (3-2, 0-2) hasn’t beaten USC since 2003 and in its last three games against the Trojans (4-1, 2-1) — all losses — it has been outscored by a combined score of 95-20.
USC, nonetheless, hopes to continue its modest seven-game winning streak over Cal on Thursday, as it faces the Golden Bears at AT&T Park in San Francisco (Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, Calif., is undergoing renovations).
Offensively, at least, it doesn’t appear as if the Trojans should anticipate much of a dropoff, as they rank 15th nationally in passing yards this season with an average of 318 yards per game. Barkley, in particular, has posted some impressive numbers of his own, completing more than 70 percent of his passes for 1,587 yards, 14 touchdowns and a mere four interceptions.
In two career games against Cal, Barkley has thrown for 635 yards with a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 5:1.
“I think I’ve been really well prepared,” Barkley said of his success against the Golden Bears. “They try to be confusing with their defensive fronts and schemes, but we have done a great job in the past at protecting what they’ve brought.”
Though the passing game is arguably as proficient as ever — sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods and freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee have combined for 76 receptions for 1,070 yards and nine touchdowns — the Trojans’ running attack has appeared rather inconsistent through five games, ranking just 70th nationally with 136.6 rushing yards per game.
Though senior tailback Marc Tyler leads the team in rushing with 338 yards and two touchdowns on 72 carries, he missed the opener against Minnesota because of a suspension that lasted for much of training camp and has been inconsistent at times this season.
Against Utah and Arizona State, Tyler finished with 113 yards and 149 yards, respectively. Against Syracuse and Arizona, though, he combined for a mere 76 yards on the ground.
“It definitely shows up on film in the second half of games,” Kiffin said when asked about any lingering effects of the suspension.
But if anything were to be labeled inconsistent, it might be the Trojans’ defense.
Despite opening the year by allowing just 17 and 14 points in wins over Minnesota and Utah, the Trojans allowed 43 and 41 points, respectively, against Arizona State and Arizona, marking the first time in program history that it surrendered at least 40 points in consecutive games.
The Golden Bears feature a passing attack that could challenge that inexperienced defense, as sophomore wide receiver Keenan Allen and senior wide receiver Marvin Jones have combined for 68 catches for 1,109 yards and seven touchdowns.
“Jeff [Tedford’s] a great quarterbacks coach and he’s got [quarterback Zach Maynard] playing well,” USC assistant head coach Monte Kiffin said. “They’ve also got a balanced attack. They can run the football and take some pressure off the quarterback.”
With an extra week to prepare, however, the Trojans remain hopeful their defense won’t have a repeat performance.
“We always strive to be perfect,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “And this game, hopefully we can put it all together. We got to because it’s been a bye week.”
Perhaps more concerning is the element of playing on the road, as the game marks just the second time this season USC has left Southern California.
Each of USC’s four wins this season have come within the friendly confines of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“This is the second time on the road, so it’s really important we come out and set the tempo,” Robey said.
Against Arizona State, USC’s only road contest of the season thus far, the Sun Devils march out to a 21-6 lead midway through the second quarter.
Thursday’s contest against Cal will kick off at 6 p.m. and will be broadcast nationally on ESPN.

Street artists are usually seen as troublemakers. Many tamper with public property, create controversial pieces with charged messages and sometimes end up being arrested for the art they create.
One of the biggest issues any street artist encounters is getting his or her work accepted as actual art. It’s tough to convince the average civilian a poster illegally placed on a telephone pole is an important work of art.
One artist who has managed to break into mainstream popular culture is Frank Shepard Fairey — better known as Shephard Fairey.  This topical artist hasn’t had it easy given his arrest in 2009 and lawsuit by the Associated Press. This reputable law breaker, who consistently challenges society with his works, will speak at the Tutor Center next Wednesday, at 7 p.m.
If you’re wondering who he is and why you should care, it’s simple: Fairey has created quite a stir in the art world.
He’s complicated the idea of the underground street artist by producing popular works like his famous Obama poster and by designing his iconic OBEY clothing line.
He isn’t just a street artist out to garner fame by placing his works in the city. He’s an important figure in the history of art, street art and society’s perception of art.
Fairey gained an interest in art as a teenager, but didn’t start out in the streets. Like any diligent art student, he attended a specialized school — the Rhode Island School of Design — to pursue a bachelor’s degree in illustration. Fairey worked at a skateboard shop after graduating and eventually went into stenciling and designing T-shirts.
In 1990, Fairey revealed a manifesto for his work, taking ideas from the philosophies of phenomenology and Martin Heidegger. He also launched his personal art career by creating posters and stencils of various sizes featuring Andre the Giant, an iconic French pro wrestler with the word OBEY over his head.
Fairey created the design with the hope of making people really think about their surroundings. For Fairey, the piece did not necessarily have one clear meaning; instead, it was merely meant to bring attention to the power of images.
Soon, the Andre the Giant design was everywhere, from telephone poles to building sides. But Fairey soon realized not everybody loved the image, — some found it annoying and destructive. The kids who loved graffiti art, however, made it their emblem.
Today, it’s not uncommon to see someone wearing an OBEY poster in the form of a T-shirt. In that sense, Fairey has been able to use us as canvases, and has managed to get his name on our lips in the process.
For many street art lovers, however, Fairey’s mainstream success makes him a sellout.
There has always been a battle between creating underground art and making money — people tend to be skeptical about the authenticity of an artist who turns a huge profit from his or her art, even if he or she started out creating works in the street. Considering Fairey’s original OBEY poster was also meant to shed light on all the commercial images that surround us, his creation of something as commercial as a clothing line felt like betrayal to some fans.
But sticking to an accepted image of artistic authenticity doesn’t pay the bills. To be fair, Fairey still took the same legal risks as all the other street artists out there. And when he wasn’t in trouble with the cops, he took the time to involve himself in activities that gave back to the community, from an art sale to benefit the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center to creating works for the recently opened West Hollywood Library. Fairey has constructed a multi-faceted image, and in the process has changed the notion of what it really means to be a “street artist.” The street artist is no longer just a kid on the street pasting up his art — he or she can be an entrepreneur, a social activist, philosopher and philanthropist at the same time, too.
Though Fairey had many significant predecessors, his prolific presence today seems to ensure the street art movement will not die out any time soon. Those OBEY posters and T-shirts might not seem like a big deal, but Fairey proves that street art — and the street artist — have much more substance than what we might think.

“An Evening With John Waters” will be held at USC’s Norris Cinema Theatre on Friday, and will be moderated by USC professor James Egan.
Egan, a filmmaker, producer and professor, has been friends with the iconic and iconoclastic filmmaker John Waters for almost 40 years.
In the early ’70s, Egan did Waters a favor by providing an insurance policy for the film Female Trouble with backing from Egan’s father’s company — but he didn’t ask his dad for permission. In return, Waters inspired Egan to pursue a lifetime career in the film industry.
“If it weren’t for [Waters], I would’ve never gotten into the film business,” Egan said. “The first student project I did in film school was an interview with him.”
Waters built a name on outrageous “trash films” that advanced the world’s image of the outlaw and the outsider by putting them in the foreground of many of his early films such as Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Desperate Living. He was attracted to the irony of ugliness, forcing the viewer to confront the obese, the snaggle-toothed and the perverse, casting actors such as Divine — perhaps the most famous transvestite of all time.
“People who first saw [Waters’] films thought these people were real,” Egan said. “It wasn’t so much the content of the films that shocked people but the possibility that these people existed and were thriving in America. He had to explain they were all fictional characters he made up in his mind. You don’t lose yourself in the characters of a Waters film — you are confronted by them.”
In addition to creating a cult following, Waters is recognized by many of modern American cinema’s most important contemporary directors, such as Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson, his work having influenced their work.
“Passionate people consider him the father of modern cinema,” Egan said. “He’s going to hate that word: ‘father.’”
Egan recently edited a book with Waters of interviews, which contains 23 articles written since 1965 by writers such as Dennis Cooper, J.T. Leroy, indie film director Todd Solondz and Egan himself. The University Press of Mississippi approached Egan to edit the book after hearing of his connections with Waters through his USC faculty biography.
“[Waters] is a very private man,” Egan said. “Because we have this lifelong friendship, I had access that few other people would be given to his archives and papers.”
To work on the book, Egan visited archives in Baltimore — Waters’s hometown and the setting of many of his films — the Museum of Modern Art in New York, The Juilliard School, Wesleyan University — where Waters’ archives are kept — and USC’s Doheny Cinematic Arts Library.
Egan also collaborated with associate professor and directing program head Everett Lewis, who contributed an appreciation piece to the end of the book.
“Lewis really supported me and deserves credit,” Egan said. “This wouldn’t have happened without his love for John Waters.”
The USC School of Cinematic Arts, intrigued by the collaboration, awarded Egan a grant, which enabled him to spend his time researching and preparing the book.
Egan read hundreds of interviews and eventually narrowed them down to the top 40.
“I wrote up little descriptions about why these articles were pivotal for depicting his work and career, and he and I discussed those and narrowed it down to the 23 that are in the book,” Egan said.
The rights to the interviews were not difficult to obtain, Egan said, because each of the writers asked were “honored” to be included in the book.
“The publisher said he’d never seen such incredible generosity,” Egan said. “It really reflects the love people have for [Waters].”
Egan currently teaches graduate-level screenwriting courses at the USC School of Cinematic Arts and is the founder and head of the award-winning Wild At Heart Films, a company that aims to produce movies “that make a difference.” It has produced films including the documentary Kimjongilia, which focuses on concentration camps in North Korea.
“I started out wanting to make John Waters movies and I end up making significantly important social change films,” Egan said. “But [Waters] has had an incredible impact implementing social change through humor. That definitely inspired me.”

Festival of California Poets
Writers, poets and all lovers of the arts, for that matter, have a lot to look forward to this weekend at the Festival of California Poets at the Hammer Museum.
The Hammer Museum, Poetry Society of America and PEN Center USA will present this fifth annual event. This year’s festivities will feature readings by prestigious and honored poets such as Maxine Hong Kingston on Lucille Clifton, Suzanne Lummis on Nora May French and James Ragan on Denise Levertov, with a Q&A to follow.
As if our very own California poets, exploring their homeland through their craft, are not enticing enough, tickets are free, a beautiful thing for the broke college student — balancing out the expense for “The Lord of the Rings In Concert” ticket. Mark your calendar — this epic literary event will be held Friday at  7 p.m.
Foo Fighters
It’s finally here: Foo Fighters are back in Los Angeles and back with a vengeance.
This energetic, iconic, riotous rock band will be performing full force at its upcoming shows put on by KROQ at The Forum on Thursday and Friday.
Frontman Dave Grohl is sure to get the crowd going with his frenetic energy and matching instrumentals will stir up a wild, crazy night, particularly with classics like “Best of You” and “Times like These.”
As an added bonus, up-and-comers Mariachi El Bronx and Cage the Elephant, think “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked,” will open this  musical spectacle.
Tickets range from about $20 to $60 but are in limited supply so be sure to reconnect with your good friend Ticketmaster or your ticketing outlet of choice.
One thing is certain: The show is sure to leave you thinking, as the band’s hit “Everlong” so beautifully puts it, If everything could ever feel this real forever / If anything could ever be this good again.
Be sure to get your tickets as soon as possible and get in on these good feelings.
Lord of the Rings concert
Saturday marks an epic musical and theatrical hybrid event.
From Peter Jackson’s critically and popularly acclaimed The Lord of the Rings series, the very movies that made an astounding feat during awards season by taking home four Oscars among many other awards, comes The Lord of the Rings In Concert: The Fellowship of the Ring.
Fans, rejoice, as this is your opportunity to relive the splendor of one of the best trilogies of all time on the big screen once again. Not quite on the bandwagon? There’s no better way to fall in love with this mythical adventure than with a live orchestra to heighten the mood and suspense.
This spectacular event will take place at the Anaheim Honda Center with tickets starting at $42.50, including service fees. Though this might seem like a hefty price for the college students, nothing compares to experiencing the epic journey of Frodo, Gandalf, Samwise the Brave, Aragorn, Legolas and so forth, with a live orchestra to accompany.
You shall not pass — up this wonderful opportunity.
Los Angeles Haunted Hayride
Let the Halloween countdown continue!
Griffith Park houses the Los Angeles Haunted Hayride, an exploration into the violent nightmares of the Clifton Twins, daughters of the zookeeper Ferdinand Clifton.
As if the premise were not creepy enough, the idea is based on the emotionally disturbing journals of the twins, which recorded the eerie nightmares caused by their sleep disorders.
Scares range from the Haunted Hayride through the woods containing “15-foot mascots of death” and “400-year-old children,” the terrifying monsters hidden in a sea of darkness in The In Between maze and The Human Menagerie featuring black magic and psychics.
Tickets start at $25 and the events go through the pinnacle of the season: Halloween night itself. Be sure to make it in time for a night of thrills.

Remake Footloose?
Reactions were mixed. After what feels like hundreds of remakes, many of which seem to get worse and worse each year (see The Women or Fame), it seems the American public has become fatigued with the lack of originality.
So, when Paramount Pictures announced in 2007 it was planning a remake of the beloved 1984 film, not many were pleased.

No one is aware of this more than the filmmaker, Craig Brewer.
“Here’s what I had to decide when I decided to do Footloose: I had to make peace with the fact that there was going to be a wall of hate coming my way,” Brewer said. “I do know that, with the best of intentions, sometimes people don’t show up, or people pre-judge. I can’t anticipate what the box office is going to be because that’s, to some degree, out of my hands.”
The film’s star, Julianne Hough, agrees.
“When I first found out they were doing a remake of an iconic movie like Footloose, which is really close to my heart, I thought the same thing — like, ugh, remakes, they suck, you know? Like, nobody ever does them justice,” Hough said.
Brewer’s involvement in the project is what apparently changed her mind.
“I think there wouldn’t have been a better choice to do this film other than Craig Brewer,” Hough said.
To some, Brewer might not be familiar. Most recently, he was behind 2005’s critically acclaimed Hustle and Flow as well as a not-so-acclaimed flick — Black Snake Moan, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and Justin Timberlake. Both films were noted for their sense of southern grittiness.
In either case, they’re a far cry from Footloose. So what inspired Brewer to take on the remake?
Brewer, who passed on the film twice, said, the need for greater authenticity in the portrayal of teenagers was what compelled him.
“There was a time where teenage movies actually dealt with teenage problems,” he said.
The portrayal was real, not glamorized or dumbed-down or as Brewer puts it, “under the guise of Glee,” taking a dig at the popular — yet pretty fluffy — television show.
Hough believes Brewer’s presence helps the remake reflect our modern society, as well as proverbially thank the original.
“I think that [Brewer] did justice with giving [the movie] the same heart that you felt when you were watching it in 1984. I think he was the perfect choice,” Hough said.
Despite success in the production process, the film was actually plagued by problems since its inception in 2007.
The original director was Kenny Ortega (High School Musical), and Zac Efron was slated to play the lead role of Ren McCormack. Differences with the studio, however, caused Ortega to back out, and Efron soon followed.
Soon afterward, Gossip Girl’s Chace Crawford came on as the lead, but left because of scheduling conflicts. Finally, Kenny Wormald signed on as Ren around the same time Brewer came on as director.
All the production conflicts worried Brewer, mainly because he was afraid the film would try too hard to be just a dance film.
“They kind of got the same team that made High School Musical,” Brewer said. “I kind of shook my head saying, you know, I don’t know what they’re going to make. Footloose is more than a dance movie.”
Brewer wanted to tap into real teenage lives. He wanted sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll — topics often deemed taboo in mainstream films based on teenage lives.
“I think I was particularly worried that a spoof was going to be done, that it was just going to be like a dance movie that somebody threw the name Footloose on, and called it a day, you know?” Brewer said.
According to Hough, a copious amount of content in the remake was based off the original Footloose, but with some tweaks, such as the loss of Ren’s mother and greater explanation as to why the town’s elders outlaw dancing.
Simply watching the film’s trailer can show how much has changed — in place of line dancing, there’s break-dancing.
Brewer isn’t worried about changes reducing the film’s appeal, though. In fact, he believes updating the original will help the film’s message speak to a new generation.
“There is a tremendous amount of love for the original,” Brewer said. “But there is also an urgency to tell a movie that has the ideals of the original Footloose, that has the energy of the original Footloose, and to give it to a new generation.”
Footloose is set for theatrical release Friday.

Same-sex classes beneficial
Leslie Chang’s “Same-sex education not as detrimental as it seems” (Oct. 6) discussing the pros and cons of same-sex education reminded me of an experiment we did when I was finishing my graduate work in the School of Education in the mid-1980s. I was a teachers assistant in the program for the study of women and men in society  -— which I believe now is referred to as gender studies.
My job was to conduct discussion sections for the SWMS General Education Class (210g) taught by Professors Gloria Orenstein and Walter Williams.
Considering the sensitive issues we were dealing with — women’s roles in a male-dominated society, stereotyped as well as unconventional sexual orientations, power and submission and so forth — it occurred to us perhaps mixed-sex discussion groups might be inhibiting some ideas and feelings from being expressed.
Thereafter, we decided to try same-sex only discussion groups for a couple of semesters.
Some students resisted at first, saying they felt uncomfortable in such an “artificial” setting, but there is no question the discussions soon took on a completely different tone, providing the students with perspectives on the issues that they wouldn’t otherwise have had.
Since the mid-1980s women’s equality and presence in mainstream society and influence in politics and the economy have changed considerably.
Still, there are two predominant genders.
As long as this situation continues, carefully-arranged same-sex groupings in educational settings and elsewhere can provide awareness opportunities that tend to break down stereotypes and lead to increased understanding of the self and others.

Single-use plastic shopping bags might be the best thing since sliced bread, but the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits. During the five-minute walk from the store to the car when we use a bag, it might be our savior, but in the long run, that very same bag could end up suffocating a sea turtle.
CALPIRG, a primarily student-run organization, is in the middle of a frantic attempt to alleviate this situation by lobbying to ban plastic bags in California, a state that, for all its claims to love the ocean and its surroundings, uses nearly 12 million plastic bags every year.
As students and as the future of the community, it is our responsibility to show support for this cause by helping the USC chapter of CALPIRG the best we can.
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, as it is sometimes known, is a dense region off the coast of California where degraded plastics, chemicals and other artificially produced debris are the dominant species.
This swirling sea of sludge contaminates the ecosystem in horrific ways, destroying the habitats and lives of thousands of marine organisms every year.
This disruption — to put it lightly — eventually ends up affecting us as well because people consume a number of these contaminated fish, ingesting of toxic substances.
By demonstrating a widespread backing of the efforts, we can send a message that the community is in favor of a major change in policy: one that doesn’t allow the chemical and plastic industries to pollute the environment without consequences. A state-wide ban, if passed, would reduce the overall plastic output and, in turn, would prevent the deaths of millions of marine creatures. CALPIRG’s Great Pacific Cleanup Campaign intends to do just that, starting with the nine chapters located at various campuses in California.
You might have seen the Plastic Bag monster fighting the Mutant Sea Turtle on campus a few weeks ago, which attempted to raise awareness about the issue and collect 9,000 petitions by the end of the semester.
Partly because of the work of CALPIRG students and their coalition partners, 14 cities and counties in California have plastic bag bans and more than 40 cities are considering proposals. Even so, unless some serious momentum builds up with regard to this issue, this ecological disaster will only continue to expand.
Showing support for local organizations trying to incite change and spreading awareness about the facts by telling friends, family and random strangers on the street are also key ways to effect change.
We might be the most resourceful creatures on this planet, but if we continue to treat the environment as our personal waste disposal system without considering the implications, it might come around to bite us in the rear.
 
Rasik Srinath is a junior majoring in mechanical engineering.
Have you ever read about or saw pictures of the North Pacific Gyre? I think it should be talked about in every school and without a ban this will continue to get larger. The main producer of single use plastic bags is China, and they are banned there. These bags put a strain on the environment as well as oil. Do some research before thinking a ban is not the answer.
More govt regulation is not the answer. Stop whining to the govt.

Every generation has its heroes.
These figures all have critics, but people in almost every demographic category revere them. Their importance shapes our culture.
What about this generation, though? Our hero is more difficult to find. We could look to politics, but even President Barack Obama, who conducted one of the most inspiring campaigns in American history, faces heavy criticism.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Entertainment celebrities are similarly ill-suited for the role because of websites like Perez Hilton and TMZ. As for entertainer-politicians; Arnold Schwarzenegger is hardly former President Ronald Reagan.
But the coverage of Steve Jobs has brought him to the forefront of media attention. His passing is a tremendous loss — and the public’s response suggests he might just be our generation’s hero.
His death has shown how the role of the traditional hero is falling and a technological innovator leader such as Jobs could be the new hero.
It might seem ridiculous to grant him this title only a week after his death. He’s been an important public figure for some time, but the term hero is rather emotional.
Yet, frankly, so are the comments on his death. Business and technology leaders have responded with reverence, but so have people who have almost nothing to do with his line of work.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg remembered Jobs with eloquence: “Again and again over the last four decades, Steve Jobs saw the future and brought it to life long before most people could even see the horizon.”
Surprisingly, so did Ashton Kutcher: “We have all surfed on the wake of Steve Jobs’ ship. Now we must learn to sail, but we will never forget our skipper.”
Emotions also ran high at Apple stores across the country. A CNET feature on the experience at the stores was full of touching quotes.
When asked how much he has spent on Apple electronics, one customer simply said, “You know what, today it doesn’t even matter. It doesn’t matter. I loved them.”
Jobs’ hero status has several implications for our generation. Some of them are related to technology. Others, though, have more to do with what we will come to expect of our future leaders.
First of all, the utilitarian days of technology are ending. Value will be determined through something more powerful than logic: feeling.
Though the last few decades have been full of rapid innovation, Jobs stood out by personalizing our relationship with gadgets.
For evidence, spend an evening watching Pixar’s Toy Story or hide your roommate’s iPod. Nowadays, it’s practically mandatory to include the personal touch.
Think about the way dysfunctional web pages look. They used to say, “404 not found.” Modern websites add in a small apologetic message, as if to demonstrate the Internet wants to say sorry.
That’s the path Jobs set us on. Judging by the way people revere his ideas, that’s the path we want technology to take. Perhaps one day we’ll shell out extra for beautiful microwaves.
More broadly, the way people idolize Jobs suggests Americans are prepared for a new kind of leader.
Traditionally, we appreciated heroes who knew how to sympathize — people who listened first and acted next (or at least appeared to do so).
Jobs didn’t fit this mold. His style is only traditional in the Silicon Valley: It’s unorthodox, informal and a little impertinent. One of his most famous quotes is about not listening to anyone but yourself: “Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice.”
He gave people what they wanted before they knew they wanted it at all.
These values could very well transcend the tech world. In 2008, the buzzwords of the presidential race were “hope” and “change.”
In a few more decades, they might be bolder; they might sound more like “think differently.”

I am guessing that modern day “heroes” who have made billions of dollars do not have an obligation to society to be philanthropic.  Can you identify any charitable act of his?  Perhaps he was too busy dreaming up the specs of the iPad 3.
jobs made us think critically and imagine that everything is possible. He will be remembered by  the generation to come emulating him as a role model  thanks to the apple.
Visionaries like Steve Jobs reveal the true secret to the Universe in that nothing is impossible with time, perseverance, and positive visualization.  Such a passion for furthering human communication inspires.  His legacy will survive generations with names like Edison, Tesla as the greatest inventors and visionaries of all time.  As an artist, I draw from these inspirations and advancements in my work and you may enjoy my recent portrait of Mr. Jobs, now In Memoriam at http://dregstudiosart.blogspot.com/2011/08/end-of-era-steve-jobs.html

Looks like there are no awards in sight for The Academy Is…, one of the most recent bands to end its run in the music biz. Apparently, the band has been growing apart since its inception nine years ago. Three albums later, it was time to cut the chord.
The Academy Is… has long been overshadowed by the slow-burning depreciation of the group. Two members left the band in May. Five months later, the rest have decided to call it quits.
The band took to its website to announce the news, saying “The Academy Is… have decided to go our separate ways,” but that the members look back on their history together with fondness, appreciation and a sense of accomplishment.
With almost 500,000 units sold of their trio of albums, numerous Warped Tour appearances and a loyal fan base, the band surely has made its mark. The video for their song “The Phrase That Pays” has almost 3 million views on Youtube.
William Beckett, the lead singer of the high-school alternative rock band, wrote on his own blog that fans can “expect new music from each of us.” So fear not, TAI fans; this is not the end. “Not by a long shot,” writes Beckett.
If you were planning on seeing the band tour with Jack’s Mannequin later this month, you’re out of luck. The band played its last official show on Sept. 8.

Renowned actress and author Shirley MacLaine, 77, will receive the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award at a gala ceremony June 7.
Known for works such as The Trouble With Harry and Terms of Endearment, MacLaine will be the 40th recipient of the AFI award, placing her among the likes of Morgan Freeman, her younger brother Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Taylor and Alfred Hitchcock. (Click here for a complete list of recipients.
You don’t have to look far to find MacLaine’s achievements. Having starred in more than 50 movies in addition to appearing on television shows and theater stages, she’s proven she’s more than just a pretty face for the camera. Her acting has been recognized in the form of six Oscar nominations (and one win for Best Actress in Terms of Endearment) and seven Golden Globe wins. If that isn’t enough, she has also authored several books, including Sage-ing While Age-ing and I’m Over All That: And Other Confessions.
Pushing past the film world, MacLaine has dabbled in politics, contributing to the 1972 presidential campaign of George McGovern. It’s also no secret that she is very spiritually minded, and her books go beyond your typical autobiographies as they often explore spiritual topics as well.
When talking about the decision to award MacLaine, president and CEO of AFI, Bob Gazzale said, “What is not to love about Shirley MacLaine … She defines the term renaissance woman and what an honor for the AFI to shine a proper light to all she’s given the world. Then when you get into her films, it’s across genres, it’s across decades. This is a force of nature all to our benefit.”
Established in 1973, the goal of the Life Achievement Award is to highlight a person of film “whose talent has in a fundamental way advanced the film art … and whose work has stood the test of time.” Embodying these specifications, MacLaine, still going strong with feature films and books, has permeated through the decades and will continue to be a force to be reckoned with.
The special award ceremony will be broadcast on TV Land in June.
