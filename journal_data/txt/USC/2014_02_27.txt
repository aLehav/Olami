On Thursday night, the Student Coalition for Asian-Pacific Empowerment hosted its third annual InspirASIAN conference, an event aimed at putting USC students in contact with members of the Asian-Pacific-American media community.

The panelists included Dante Basco, a slam poet and voice actor for Nickelodeon’s Avatar: The Last Airbender in which he played Zuko; Jenny Yang, a comedian and writer; Taz Ahmed, an American-Muslim activist and USC alumna, and Traci Kato-Kiriyama, a  multi-disciplinary artist.
Despite the conference’s emphasis on reaching out to the  Asian-Pacific-American community, SCAPE aimed to make the night accessible to all USC students. Alex Kanegawa, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism and social media chair for SCAPE, saw this as distinguishing from the mainstream media.
“There’s a lot to be learned,” Kanegawa said. “I don’t think this is something that only Asian people will care about; these artists are talented. I think it’s a good gateway into L.A. culture, and these are important figures in their local community.”
SCAPE’s goal of empowering USC’s Asian-Pacific-American community has prompted it to ally with community centers seeking social justice. Kanegawa also stressed that the panel’s gender ratio, with women as three of the four panelists, aimed to promote another under-represented community.
This emphasis on social justice of any and all kinds found itself in all the speakers’ performances.
Kato-Kiriyama lead the evening with her performance poem “Desire,” which looked at lesbian relationships. One particular line, “what made a girl a girl was the ability to be an object of desire / but not an object to be desired by me,” expanded the scope of the event beyond Asian-Pacific-American issues.
Yang followed Kato-Kiriyama’s performance with a stand-up bit. Her brand of comedy, based around deconstructing Asian stereotypes, started with a freestyle rap completely in Chinese. For those who did not know Chinese, this caused a strange discomfort, which Yang promptly made fun of.
“I’m playing really hard right now,” Yang said, “You’re like ‘oh, did I walk into the wrong room. I thought this event was for all Asians, why is this so Chinese?’”
Yang’s comedy ranged from jokes about pi, to jokes about how pi jokes only enforced the Asian stereotype. By playing on the audience’s discomfort with these stereotypes, she highlighted the modern conditions of racism.
Ahmed’s poetry dealt with her experience growing up as a Bangladeshi-American. Her poem “Mantras of Silence” played on the adage “if you don’t have anything good to say, say nothing at all.” Ahmed claimed that this statement had paralyzed her during her youth.
Basco shared poetry based on his character from Avatar: The Last Airbender.
“So, if you don’t know what Avatar is I can’t help you,” Basco said. “But on my Instagram, you know those 15-second videos, I wrote some 15-second videos for Avatar. Here’s the first 15-second poem.”
After that, Basco shared a medley of poems dealing with his Catholic and Filipino heritage, which silenced the room.
Yang went on to discuss the many identities that play a part in her life.
“There’s so much that we are,” Yang said. “I identify as Chinese, Asian-American, because that’s a political choice. A woman. Female. Feminist. Somewhat everything. There’s so many. I didn’t come out of the womb or college thinking I would do stand-up comedy. I definitely identify these last few years as an artist, writer and       stand-up comedian.”
Then, jokingly, Kato-Kiriyama replied, “All of the above.”
Becky Houser, a freshman majoring in animation and digital arts, found the panelists’ comments on art to be insightful.
“I like what all  the  panelists had to say about expressing yourself through art,” Houser said. “Especially as part of the Asian American community, because I am half [Asian]. Because I’m in the cinematic arts school, that really struck a chord with me.”
Carolina Chiou, a freshman majoring in fine arts, felt the evening was marked by strong performances.
“I really liked Jenny’s rap in Chinese, and I actually understood it,” Chiou said. “I liked Taz’s performance too. I liked what she said about Muslim women and how she wants to change everyone’s view … Everyone’s just focused on how repressed [Muslim women] are, but if that’s what they believe in, they should do what they want.”

In a field traditionally dominated by men, the role of female engineers can often be downplayed. In recent years, however, the number of women in the industry is growing rapidly, and the Viterbi School of Engineering is helping to lead this effort.
The Office of Women in  Engineering in Viterbi reports that 30 percent of its undergraduate population is female. Though that number might seem low in comparison to the 51 percent of women who make up the university’s student body as a whole, the American Society of Engineers reported that in 2011, only 18.4 percent of bachelor’s degrees in engineering went to women.
Despite the fact that only 30 percent of women make up Viterbi’s undergraduate population, faculty and students said it often does not feel this way in their classes.
Lianne Moreno, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, noted her classes were usually split equally between males and females.
“In my classes, it is 50/50,” Moreno said. “In fact, in some of my engineering classes, I feel that there are even more girls than boys.”
Milind Tambe, a professor in the computer science and industrial and systems engineering departments, made a similar remark. He has experience working with both students getting their Ph.D.s and students in Freshman Academy, a two-unit class that gives freshmen an introduction to engineering through guest lectures and team projects. Tambe said he has noticed that there is not a remarkable difference between male and female students.
“In my classes, approximately half of the students are male and half are female,” Tambe said.
Mia Smith, a senior majoring in environmental engineering, explained that students could be led to believe there are less women in certain classes because of the specific major’s demographics.
“Some majors attract more women than others,” Smith said. “For example, when I take classes outside of my major, I sometimes feel there are more men since environmental engineering is more attractive to women. Still, I don’t feel outnumbered.”
Students also felt that professors treat their students equally regardless of gender.
“Professors are just as strict,” Moreno said. “They have the same expectations for boys and girls.”
Many of the students agreed that Viterbi provides a supportive environment to its female students, and believe that this is one of the reasons why the male-to-female ratio of students in Viterbi is higher than the national average.
“I believe that Viterbi is attracting more women into engineering because it has a diverse and engaging program that encourages women to take the lead in an engineering career,” said Leilani Rebolledo, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering.
Viterbi offers a variety of programs catered to female engineers. One is the Society of Women Engineers, an organization with a main focus of creating a community of female engineers. The group hosts many networking events for its members.
The Women in Engineering office also provides female students with opportunities for community outreach and a place where they can receive leadership development and professional support.
Many of the students also said that aside from Viterbi having multiple programs, the feedback they received outside of the school has been rather positive.
Moreno said when she would tell her family and friends that she was going to study engineering, they were encouraging.
As for Smith, she agreed that she never received negative feedback and people were usually encouraging. Smith has engaged in a variety of international studies, and she said she has noticed that other countries are changing their perspectives in regard to women in engineering as well. During her semester studying abroad in Cape Town, South Africa, Smith noticed that in her engineering classes, there were far fewer women. She mentored high school girls who seemed very enthusiastic about studying engineering.
“There is a lot of development going on in Cape Town, and many of the young women are eager to get involved in the engineering aspect,” Smith said.
Smith also spent a summer in China working in a research lab and she was surprised by the number of female engineers.
“I thought it would be the same, but there were many women engineers,” Smith said.
Despite the changing industry, students are still aware of some of the prejudice that comes along with being female engineers.
Alexia Gutiérrez, a junior majoring in environmental engineering, recalled the time when she was applying for an interview and they tried to discourage her.
“They were surprised that I was a girl, and they started telling me that in construction sites it was very aggressive, suggesting that it would be a difficult environment for a woman to work in,” Gutiérrez said.
Still, Viterbi’s female engineers viewed their role as somewhat of a challenge. Karishma Nagar, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, has faced similar difficulties, but is glad to take on the challenge.
“Eventually if you demonstrate a sound understanding of problems and come up with innovative ways to resolve them, you gain credibility and are taken just as seriously as your male counterparts,” Nagar said. “I don’t consider the prejudice as an obstacle. Rather, [it’s] a challenge to take on.”

Michael Reinprecht, a current European Union official and former Austrian diplomat, discussed the EU Neighborhood Policy with students on Thursday afternoon.
Foreign affairs · European Union official Michael Reinprecht met with students to discuss current and past crises facing the organization. – Kirstin Louie | Daily Trojan
The event was hosted by the International Relations Undergraduate Association, an organization that strives to connect students with professionals in the field of international relations.
Adela Jones, a member of the executive board for the association, gave insight into its hope to make a difference among the student body.
“A lot of planning and foresight goes into these events,” she said. “Relevance is especially important to keep in mind — we want to keep [international relations] students informed on current events by connecting them with experts on the subject, people who have firsthand experience.”
Reinprecht began the event with a discussion on the state of the current European Union Neighborhood Policy. This policy is not to be confused with the European Union itself, but rather something developed to prevent dividing lines between the EU and its new neighbors.
“It is not to be mistaken for a waiting room for membership into the EU,” Reinprecht said.
The ENP shares the same goals as the EU, as it aims to build upon mutual commitments to common values throughout Europe. The EU itself dominated the discussion at the event.
The EU prides itself on inclusiveness, which was the basis for the ENP. There are certain conditions to joining the union, however, which Reinprecht listed.
“To become a member, a                nation-state must have a functioning market economy, democratic structures, rules of human law and respect for common rules and policies,” Reinprecht said.
These conditions prevent Ukraine and Russia from being a part of the EU. These two nations were the main topics of discussion as they fueled the creation of the ENP. Reinprecht, however, mentioned that both are strong candidates for potential membership.
“Although there would be mutual benefit in including both Russia and the Ukraine to the EU, the countries do not fit within the standards yet,” Reinprecht said.
The EU has promising future plans. Between now and 2020, they plan to put an emphasis on pre-accession assistance, peacekeeping, human rights action and the spread of democracy, Reinprecht said. He discussed how the EU plans to reward nations that support democratic values by giving them further economic support.
“The EU has allocated 50 billion euros to this project. This is about 20 million U.S. dollars,” Reinprecht said.
The students attending the event matched Reinprecht’s passion for the subject.
“Having someone extremely knowledgeable share his opinions gives us a different view on current events,” said Brian Sun, a senior majoring in international relations.
Juhee Shah, a freshman majoring in health and humanity, echoed Sun’s sentiments.
“It’s a different experience than if you just learned all this in a class,” Shah said. “It’s a whole different perspective to hear from someone with personal experience.”
The event ended with a conversation about the future of the EU. Reinprecht admitted that “this is an open question because no one really knows.” He continued to name the United States as an example for promising outcome.
Whether or not Russia and Ukraine become members of the Union is uncertain. Reinprecht emphasized, however, that the EU is moving forward regardless. Reinprecht closed the discussion on an optimistic note, saying, “One day the whole of Europe may be living cooperatively under the EU umbrella.”

The tension packed action/thriller Non-Stop pits Liam Neeson against terrorists hijacking a plane, but the frantic pace of the film and general implausibility detract from its solid acting and unique premise. The film has several glaring plot holes and issues throughout, problems which Liam Neeson’s star power does not have the ability to redeem.

Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a federal air marshal who suffers from a drinking problem. He is scheduled to go on a flight to London from New York. After Neeson gets settled on the flight, he receives texts from an anonymous person asking for $150 million and threatening that otherwise someone will die every 20 minutes. While Neeson’s character tries to find the hijacker, everyone on the plane becomes more wary of him as the flight goes on. As he barrels through his frantic search for the hijacker, he must deal with the dissent among the plane passengers and the accusations that he has gone rogue and is attacking the United States.
The film is ambitious with its plot. While there have been hijacking films in the past, Non-Stop is the type of thriller where the audience is constantly guessing who the terrorist is and how he or she is capable of manipulating the events on the plane. The film analyzes how technology can change the nature of terrorism. With people being picked off one by one and the people on the ground less likely to comply with Marks’ requests, the film’s plot does an excellent job of building up anxiety and tension. With so much paranoia surrounding flights since 9/11, the topic consistently captures the attention of the audience.
The major draw of this film is Neeson. After the sleeper hit Taken was released in 2008, Neeson has become the epitome of the older, weathered action star. That film elevated him to incredible fame, and Non-Stop tries to bank off that film’s success. It makes no mistake in emphasizing that he is the major appeal of the film. He is featured predominantly in almost every single shot. Neeson’s performance mostly consists of barking at people and looking angry, which he capably complies with. His performance is not outstanding by any means, but it works. He is the vintage, hardened bad-ss that people expect to see in his films.
The film also builds up a talented supporting cast, led by Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll and Lupita Nyong’o. They are all victims on the plane, concerned onlookers who must deal with the potential of a rogue air marshal. They realistically convey a vast range of emotions, from concern to paranoia to anger. The supporting cast’s roles are fairly minimal, however, in order to incorporate as much of Neeson as possible during the film. Though they all play their parts well, the film’s shortcomings limit their ability to perform.
The major issue with the film’s plot is that it takes multiple turns toward the improbable. Drugs, firearms and bombs are just a few of the items that manage to be snuck onto this particular flight. And though this might be construed as an attack at the TSA, terrorists most likely do not come up with plans that require all three of these being successfully smuggled onto the plane. There is also one sequence in particular in which, as the plane loses its balance, Marks manages to somehow catch a gun in midair and fire it successfully at his target. The film relies heavily on coincidences and absurdity to propel the plot forward.
The pacing of the plot also struggles to find balance. The film is an action/thriller, but throughout the film, there is not much physical action or violence. Once in a while, Bill Marks will dazzle the audience with a special move that he must have learned at spy camp. But the majority of the film follows the formulaic pattern of Marks accusing someone of being the terrorist, then being wrong. The film jumps from moment to moment in rapid succession, never stopping to take a break. Once the film gets the ball rolling, it never stops. The tensions are never resolved, and audience members are forced to deal with higher and higher stakes without any breaks for the entirety of the film.
Non-Stop is not a bad movie. It can spark enough audience attention that some people will be utterly captivated as the plot unravels. The cast does an adequate job, but they do not have the talent or the skill to save the film from its pitfalls. The general lack of regard for plot holes and implausibility will leave many moviegoers shaking their heads as they walk out of the theater.

All your bags are packed, you’re ready to go — or are you? Traveling to a new city might seem simple enough, but having a plan can mean the difference between a good vacation and a great vacation. Upon recently returning from the first weekend trip of my semester abroad, I’ve found that some of the best travel survival tips either aren’t quite so apparent or just need proper reinforcing.
Despite the name of this column, I by no means consider myself a travel guru, but I have learned a few valuable basic starter tips for travelers-in-training. The following advice is based on a two-day trip to Edinburgh, Scotland, but these guidelines apply to anyone planning a quick trip somewhere new on a budget. Bon voyage!
Pack light
This one seems obvious but is likely the most often ignored piece of travel advice. It might seem prudent to throw in that extra T-shirt “just in case,” but all that extra weight will eventually catch up with you when you’re lugging an oversized suitcase around a foreign city. You never know how long you’ll need to carry your bag, so try to avoid taking anything larger than a carry-on with you. If you’re flying, waiting in line to check a suitcase and retrieve it when you land will cut into prime exploring time, and really, how much stuff do you need? Believe me, it’s less than you think.
Have a plan
I had this idea in my head that when I got to Edinburgh, I would step off the plane into the middle of the city and instantly know where I wanted to go. This did not happen. First of all, it’s important to have an idea of the logistical information you’ll need to actually get where you want to go, like buses and trains from an airport to a city’s center. Secondly, having a rough itinerary will allow you to maximize your time. Once you’ve chosen a few sights to see, take a look at a map and plan out the most logical order for your tour. Consider transportation and time spent at each stop, but don’t be afraid to take a detour. Some of the best stuff you’ll encounter on your journey is off the beaten path.
Talk to locals
You’re only traveling for a few days, so you probably don’t have time to become an expert on a brand new city. Good thing there are plenty of experts all around you! Locals have all the inside information, such as where to get the best food and which attractions are OK to skip, not to mention they are pretty excited that you are American, at least in my experience. Even if they don’t tell you anything useful, congratulations, you just made a friend.
Be aware
This tip is actually pretty serious if you’re thinking in terms of holding on tightly to your wallet and passport, which you should do, by the way, but cultural awareness can be just as important and a little harder to pick up on. For example, it is apparently illegal in Scotland to take photos of the Crown Jewels. Was there a sign that said “No cameras”? Yes. Was there a sign that called into question the legality of using said camera? No. The moral of the story is don’t push it, or at least that’s what the lady who chased after me said. To avoid hiccups on your trip, think seriously about doing anything that you suspect might not be 100 percent acceptable.
Do the cheesy tourist stuff
I’m not talking about taking your new Facebook profile picture in front of Big Ben or the Eiffel Tower, though I can’t say I haven’t done that. I’m talking about the embarrassing activities that your parents would have made you do if they were with you on the trip, while you roll your eyes and pretend that you’re not having a good time. Let’s not kid ourselves: That stuff is usually hilarious. I was skeptical when my friend wanted to go on a nighttime tour of haunted locations in Edinburgh, but one look at the cloak-wearing guide and I was hooked. It was highly entertaining even though we were surrounded by vacationing families. And now I know a lot more about Middle Age torture.
Shop smart
Drop the credit card and step away from the cash register. Before you commit to bringing home that authentic Scottish kilt or a full-on lederhosen getup, consider the question, “Do I really need this?” Most shops near major sights and attractions are huge tourist traps offering overpriced, overrated souvenirs that serve no real purpose other than making it clear to everyone around you that you are a gullible foreigner. Plus, don’t forget you’ll need to carry your purchase around with you. If you really want a memento from your travels, take some pictures.

In 2003, John Cusack starred in a dark gem of a horror thriller called Identity. The film, helmed by future Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma director James Mangold, revolved around 11 apparent strangers who take shelter in a Nevada motel during a storm, only to discover that there’s a deranged killer hiding in their midst. The film used this deceptively generic premise — one heavy with allusions to Agatha Christie’s seminal whodunit Ten Little Indians and Hughes Mearns’ eerie poem “Antigonish” — to subvert audience expectations, defy genre conventions and deliver a diabolical denouement that succeeded in being simultaneously absurd and totally unnerving.

Now, 11 years and dozens of forgettable direct-to-DVD releases later, Cusack is checking into another motel with an alarmingly high body count, but the results couldn’t be more different. Writer-director David Grovic’s The Bag Man, formerly known by the even more innocuous title Motel, is already an early contender for 2014’s dullest, dreariest, most derivative excuse for a movie, an insipid Tarantino knockoff starved of all original thought, honest emotion or even basic technical competence. Attention, screenwriters: If a scene involving Robert De Niro waxing poetic about his favorite episode of Full House fails to earn a laugh, that’s a pretty good indicator that something has gone horribly wrong.
Cusack stars as Jack, the “hit man with a heart of gold” inspired — some would say lifted wholesale — by the actor’s role in the 1997 assassin comedy Grosse Pointe Blank. De Niro, meanwhile, appears as the enigmatic crime boss Dragna, Jack’s frequent employer and, based on his snazzy pompadour, a die-hard Bruno Mars fan. The plot, such as it is, kicks in after Draga hires Jack to recover a mysterious parcel for him, expressly forbidding his underling from looking inside it, a plot development that should prove mildly intriguing to those who have never seen Pulp Fiction, Kiss Me Deadly or even that episode of Spongebob Squarepants in which Spongebob becomes obsessed with the contents of Patrick’s jealously guarded “secret box.” Spoiler alert: The MacGuffin lurking in Jack’s bag have nothing to do with embarrassing photos from a Christmas party.
After recovering the bag in a shootout that leaves one of his hands a mangled mess, Jack holes up in a seedy motel run by the fidgety, wheelchair-bound Ned (Crispin Glover, the only actor who isn’t defeated by the film’s often cringe-inducing dialogue) to care for his injury and await further instructions from Dragna. He’s there literally five minutes before running into Rivka (Rebecca Da Costa), a blue-haired hooker dressed in a torn Wonder Woman costume. Rivka wants to use Jack’s deadly skill set to escape from her abusive employers, namely Lizard (Sticky Fingaz), whose defining character trait seems to be his snakeskin eye patch, and a surly dwarf named Guano (Martin Klebba). At first Jack resists, but who can deny true love when it’s this forced and uninteresting?
Even though De Niro and Cusack have become notorious for lending their considerable talents to bottom-rung dreck like this, it’s still pretty mystifying to watch them appear in a movie whose script peaks in quality when a character named Jack actually says, “You don’t know Jack.” Not even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Laurence Olivier of one-liners, could hope to elevate a stinker like that. Cusack, meanwhile, stumbles through the film in a disheveled stupor. De Niro, hidden behind designer lenses and a Liberace wig, seems surprisingly engaged, probably because he only has to appear for a handful of scenes. The sooner he reunites with Martin Scorsese for The Irishman or The Winter of Frankie Machine, the better. Da Costa, a Brazilian model and actress, has a fierce, unfocused energy that might prove more interesting in future projects. To be fair, none of the performances here are flat-out terrible. The fault lies with the slick, self-satisfied script.
The Bag Man also suffers from a troubling undercurrent of misogyny. When Dragna breaks the nose of his female assistant over an innocent accounting error, the camera eagerly zooms in, lingering on the woman’s quivering, tear-streaked face for several beats longer than necessary. Later, when a trio of crooked cops detains Cusack and Da Costa, a barely clothed Da Costa is brutalized by a leering backwoods sheriff during a long, clumsy sequence that stops the movie cold, derailing any forward momentum the story had managed to pick up during its mildly diverting second act. A clumsy final reveal also raises  disturbing implications about Jack’s relationship with his recently departed wife. Precious little here actually makes sense, and all of it seems cobbled together from  bits and pieces of far better movies, especially an ending that appears determined to rip off Seven and the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo simultaneously.
Simply put, life is too short to waste on recycled garbage like The Bag Man.

Someone once told me that time is a flat circle — that everything we’ve ever done or will do, we’re doomed to repeat over and over again.
Righting the ship · Head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s Women of Troy started out strong in 2014, winning seven of their first eight Pac-12 games. Since then, USC has dropped six of eight, including their last three contests. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Okay, admittedly, that pseudo-philosophy didn’t come from the sanest of sources — a suspected murderer on HBO’s excellent new crime thriller True Detective said it — but fans of USC’s women’s basketball team might be quick to adopt such an outlook on life.
The Women of Troy haven’t received a berth to the NCAA Tournament since 2006, but have come agonizingly close to snapping that streak several times. When I covered the team as a beat writer during the 2010-11 season, former head coach Michael Cooper stressed to me several times that the magic number USC had to reach to get a bid was 20 wins. It sounds pretty arbitrary, but it might just be true.
USC hired Cooper back in 2009 to universal praise — Cooper had won consecutive WNBA championships in 2001-02 as head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks, and looked primed to guide USC back to March Madness.
Instead, over the next four years, the Women of Troy only participated in a maddening cycle of near-triumphs and missed opportunities. In a span of three seasons from 2009-2012, the Women of Troy finished each regular season with 18 or 19 wins, with each year ending the same way — as one of the “last teams out” of the Big Dance. In 2012-13, USC finally reached the magic number 20 — but in the losses column. The Women of Troy only logged 11 wins, Cooper resigned and everything reset — perhaps a little too familiarly.
Hope presented itself this offseason in the form of new coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, who captured two national championships while playing for USC from 1982-86. That sliver of hope became a beacon after the Women of Troy stormed out to a 14-6 start and were miraculously standing all by themselves in second place in the Pac-12 with a 7-1 conference record after upsetting then-No. 16 Cal on the road on Jan. 24. That 20-win goal looked easily attainable — all the Women of Troy had to do was win six of their last 10 games.
Since then, however, things have taken a turn for the worse. USC has lost six of its last eight, including devastating home losses to Washington and Washington State, two fringe bubble teams with whom the Women of Troy are now tied for fifth in the Pac-12 with a 9-7 conference record. In a conference that will likely put four teams in the NCAA Tournament, USC looks to be just one spot out of contention — again.
There is still some hope, though. ESPN women’s basketball bracketologist Charlie Creme has USC as the headliners of a group labeled “Next Four Out,” five spots away from the field of 64 (the NCAA tournament for women’s basketball doesn’t contain the silly “First Four” as the men’s bracket does to expand the amount of bids to 68 — though it would certainly help the Women of Troy this season). That’s certainly within striking range — but USC really can’t afford to suffer a loss until the semifinals of the Pac-12 Tournament, if then.
The squad’s two remaining regular-season contests — against Colorado and Utah, two bottom-rung teams in the Pac-12 — are absolute must-wins. As the probable No. 5 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament, USC would then face hapless Arizona (5-22, 1-15) in the first round before playing the No. 4 seed (basically whoever loses between Arizona State and Oregon State in their matchup this weekend) in the quarterfinals.
If they win all four of those games, the Women of Troy will have finally reached the evasive 20-win plateau. Unfortunately, that still might not be enough — losses to lowly Cal State Northridge and mediocre Saint Mary’s have looked increasingly worse as the season has progressed, and USC’s best nonconference win is against Fresno State, a middling squad that won’t make the NCAA Tournament unless it clinches an automatic bid by winning the Mountain West tournament.
The Women of Troy do have that impressive road win over Cal — but might have negated that by conceding a loss to the Bears at home last week. USC also hung tough with Stanford at the Galen Center last week, eventually falling by five points, the Cardinal’s smallest margin of victory this season. But the NCAA Tournament selection committee claims it doesn’t take margin of victory into account, so the hard-fought loss will be just that for the Women of Troy — a loss.
A missed opportunity.
The Women of Troy are well-acquainted with that term after years of heartbreaking collapses down the stretch. But those painful memories could be wiped away with a massive upset over No. 1 seed Stanford in the Pac-12 Tournament, which would virtually guarantee them an invitation to the Big Dance.
Ultimately, this season should not be regarded as a major failure even if USC misses out on March Madness once again. The future looks bright, as Cooper-Dyke has proven to be a solid recruiter, vaulting USC’s four-woman recruiting class to the top 15 of ESPN’s Class of 2014 rankings.
But the Women of Troy have drawn top recruits before. One of them, senior forward Cassie Harberts, is about to graduate as one of the program’s all-time most accomplished scorers. But a NCAA Tournament appearance is not among her many achievements. Is she doomed to repeat the experience of nearly missing out on the NCAA Tournament? Or are the Women of Troy finally ready to exit the seemingly never-ending circle of excruciating defeats?

The sun never stopped shining at Marks Stadium yesterday afternoon, allowing the USC women’s tennis team to pick up its fourth consecutive victory. The No. 6 Women of Troy (7-2, 0-0) avoided the threat of rain and defeated St. Mary’s 6-1 behind dominant efforts in singles and doubles action.
Second chance · Junior Sabrina Santamaria, the 17th-ranked singles player in the nation, defeated No. 6 Jenny Julien of St. Mary’s yesterday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Starting off the day was the 19th-ranked doubles team of senior Kaitlyn Christian and junior Sabrina Santamaria, who finished off the Gaels’ Jenny Jullien and Catherine Leduc by a score of 8-0. Freshman Zoë Katz and senior Brynn Boren, ranked No. 8 nationally, secured the doubles point for USC shortly after, defeating Parminder Kaur and Danielle Flores 8-2. It has been all good news recently for Katz, who was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week after clinching victories over San Diego State and No. 4 California in her previous two outings. Seemingly on their way to a doubles victory for USC was the remaining team of juniors Giuliana Olmos and Zoë Scandalis, whose match was suspended at 6-2. Olmos and Scandalis are ranked sixth in the nation.
The singles portion of the match seemed to move just as quickly, with the Women of Troy claiming the three wins they needed for victory in quick succession. Sophomore southpaw Ellie Yates got things started with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Jade Frampton. Not far behind was Christian, who took down Leduc 6-1, 6-0. Olmos, the nation’s 65th-ranked singles player, then picked up her team’s fourth and final necessary point with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Kaur.
Still left to play individually were the Women of Troy’s top-three seeded singles players: Santamaria, Boren and Scandalis. Seventeenth-ranked Santamaria scored an impressive 6-1, 6-4 win over No. 6 Julien, while No. 30 Scandalis picked up a dramatic 6-3, 3-6, 10-8 over No. 69 Jamie Pawid. USC’s only individual loss of the day came from Boren, who fell to Flores 6-4, 7-6.
Though she has lost her last two singles matches, Boren’s performance yeterday was a promising sign. The ITA All-American transfer from Tennessee struggled with injury throughout last summer and missed several matches earlier this season. Playing in the competitive No. 2 slot, the Laguna Niguel, Calif. native has shown steady improvement in her matches over the past few weeks.
Yesterday marked USC’s second win over St. Mary’s this year; the two squads first met in the championship of ITA Kick-Off Weekend last month. Last time, the Women of Troy completed a 4-0 sweep. This victory was especially sweet for Santamaria, who got another crack at defeating Julien after the pair’s previous match was suspended. In January, the two appeared to be heading into a third, deciding set when the match was called after a USC victory.
The Women of Troy will now travel to the Lone Star state to take on No. 26 Texas on Sunday before returning to Los Angeles for a huge home showdown with No. 2 UCLA next Friday.
The Bruins boast two of the nation’s top 10 singles players in No. 3 Robin Anderson and No. 9 Chanelle Van Nguyen, along with the top-ranked doubles team of Anderson and Jennifer Brady. The Women of Troy will attempt to avoid the fate of their male counterparts, who fell to the Bruins 5-2 last Tuesday.

The USC women’s lacrosse team enters its second campaign of Division I competition today, taking on Marist at McAlister Field. The Women of Troy, who were tabbed third in the preseason Mountain Pacific Sports Federation poll, begin the year with high hopes after making a run to the MPSF conference tournament semifinals last season.
Young and talented· Sophomore midfielder Amanda Johansen leads a strong contingent of underclassmen for the USC women’s lacrosse team. Johansen scored 41 goals and added 16 assists in a strong freshman campaign. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Similar to USC, the Marist Red Foxes finished just under .500 a year ago and ended their season in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference finals, just short of an NCAA tournament bid. The Red Foxes lost their top scorer and goalie this season, however, and are now led now by attacker Kirsten Viscount, who scored 39 goals last season, and Jamie Romano, who added 32.
“They’re a great team, very physical, and prepared to battle,” USC head coach Lindsay Munday said. “We’re just excited for the challenge … and excited to come together as a team after the long preseason.”
Considering the Women of Troy’s jump in the preseason polls, USC could earn its first NCAA tournament bid by season’s end — an impressive feat for such a new program. Munday has made sure, however, to keep the team focused on handling its own business rather than getting caught up in others’ expectations.
“We don’t set goals for the season because we’re more focused on ourselves,” Munday said. “It’s a daily commitment, focusing every day on getting better and looking at yourself in the mirror asking if you’ve given everything you have to this team.”
This past season, USC relied heavily on its inaugural freshman class to carry the bulk of the load. Nearly every major contributor returns this year, and Munday sees leadership as one of the strengths of the Women of Troy.
“What’s great about this team is that we have 37 players that are leaders,” Munday said. “Whether you’re a freshman in your first collegiate game or have more experience, we want everybody to be a leader on this team.”
USC’s roster only features two senior leaders in midfielder Ceilidh Meagher and midfielder/defender Elizabeth Eddy, who pulls double duty for USC’s women’s soccer team and was recently drafted by the National Women’s Soccer League.
One of USC’s younger leaders is sophomore midfielder Amanda Johansen, who started all 18 games for USC a year ago, finishing with 41 goals and 16 assists. The Glen Head, N.Y. native said the Women of Troy have benefited from a greater number of players in training throughout the fall and preseason, increasing the intensity level in practice.
“This year we have a full army,” Johansen said. “Now we can go fast-pace in practice and have a lot more ways to attack. We’re a lot more talented team.”
With a full roster and a brand new season ahead of them, the Women of Troy are focused on starting off the season strong against Marist. Whether or not the USC women’s lacrosse team is ready to make its first NCAA tournament appearance, fans will just have to wait and see.
“Every team in Division I wants to [make the tournament], but we’re taking it one day at a time,” Johansen said. “It’s all about the journey.”

Hayao Miyazaki has captivated audiences around world with dramatic yet light-hearted storytelling and enchanting animation. Within a two-hour animated film, Miyazaki weaves a tale of romance, history and an assortment of aviation eye-candy.
A phenomenal takeoff · The Wind Rises takes audiences to higher places.
In contrast with his previous child-friendly movie, Ponyo, Miyazaki’s latest animated film gives rise to a historical drama based on a blend of both Tatsuo Hori’s short story “The Wind Has Risen” and the designer of the  A6M Zero, Jiro Horikoshi. The animated feature follows the fictional life of Jiro Horikoshi as he aspires to design the world’s most beautiful airplanes. His passion for aviation influences his recurring dreams with his personal hero Caproni, the famous Italian aeronautical engineer. Initially, Jiro’s dream to pilot airplanes was metaphorically crushed by his nearsighted vision. Yet this limitation never stopped him as he finds other means to channel his fascination for aeronautics. Interestingly, it is Jiro’s imagined version of Caproni that lights Jiro’s inspirational candle to create airplanes. Immediately after Jiro receives inspirational words to follow his dreams, he buries himself in his studies of an English aviation magazine under candlelight.
Of course, one of the most extraordinary aspects for every Miyazaki film is attention to detail with every animation frame. Miyazaki, along with his team of talented animators, undergoes great pains to take audiences to an interactive world where the audience can feel the cold sensation of metallic surfaces by sight alone. During Jiro’s tour to Germany, he surveys a Junkers G38 and the microscopic detail of the plane’s ridges and rivets overwhelm the human eyes, leaving it unable to blink in fear of absorbing too little information before the camera pans away. Another scene worth mentioning is the initial earthquake, the low rumbling of which numbed and deafened ears as the uprooted earth swallowed vision. The crying earth screamed as it tore to pieces and houses crumbled as they were ripped from their foundations. Words fail to describe the trauma experienced by audience members as they watch the horror unfold on the screen.
World famous animator and film director, Hideaki Anno, provides the monotonous voice of the movie’s hero. Despite criticism, Anno’s unchanging inflections create a realistic personality for Jiro that audiences can relate to. Instead of an actor repeating well-rehearsed lines, Anno portrayed Jiro with such realistic sincerity that the audience quickly adjusts to his unusual style of vocal delivery. Anno’s voice made Jiro more believable as a character, as his passions could clearly be read despite his muted demeanor. Overall, Anno’s lethargic rhetoric was indeed very characteristic of Jiro, who is portrayed as a remarkably normal person imbued with an interest in aeronautics.
Surprisingly, the most amiable aspect of The Wind Rises was not the animation but how it addresses the subjective and controversial topic of art itself. The audience can sympathize with Jiro, a blindly enthusiastic artist, who pushes through long nights to design a flyable aircraft despite his continual failures. Similar to how Jiro built his planes out of sheer appreciation, Miyazaki creates his films out of sheer passion to plant the seeds of inspiration around the world. The movie reflects the personal sacrifices and risks of being too involved in artistic fervor. These passions manifest in Jiro’s workaholic personality where he places his work above spending time taking care of his wife. At the same time, Jiro’s naivety is a result of his devotion to his dreams. While Jiro is in the middle of Nazi Germany observing the new Junkers G. 38, he seems oblivious to the destructive capabilities of the plane even as his friend reminds him of the amount of arsenal the plane can carry. Throughout the film, Jiro’s fixation on airplanes has left him ignore his descent into military affairs as he focuses on designing flyable works of art.
But to many critics, Jiro’s occupation as a World War II fighter designer overshadows his innocent desire to create stunning and innovative airplanes. The movie sparked controversy both in and outside of Japan as critics accused Miyazaki of asserting a pro-war message by glorifying the man who designed military aircraft. Yet this is an entirely misconstrued interpretation of Jiro’s character and the overall message of the movie. Ultimately, Jiro’s dreams and education bring him to work for the Japanese government because it was the only viable compromise to express his abilities and make a living. He reaches his goal of building magnificent airplanes but unfortunately his art was used as a tool of war. Miyazaki intended for this film to be a reflection his own dedication as an artist, where his passions have led him to let the time and his own work slip out of his hands and into the control of others. Lost in his own dreams of inventing goliath airplanes, he slowly drowns out the events occurring in the rest of the world, seemingly unfazed by anything other than his work and his wife.
Certainly, the historical backdrop of World War II in context is merely an allusion to blurred lines between artistic invention and innovation for personal satisfaction and for militarism. Working for the Japanese government was the only method of making money and attaining his dream at the same time. Jiro has no intention of developing for the purpose of nationalistic pride; he just happened to build Japan’s most deadly fighter planes. Despite Jiro’s brilliance, his naive obsession to design aircrafts blinds him from the changing world around him until it’s too late and can no longer take back the destruction his creations have caused.
The film’s underlying message in The Wind Rises is portrayed no differently than Miyazaki’s previous fantasy films. Although Jiro is able to achieve his goal, he solemnly shows remorse over the use of his art as weapons of mass destruction. Similarly to Jiro’s own aspirations to make beautiful airplanes, Miyazaki’s purpose in creating The Wind Rises is simply because he wanted to make something beautiful.

On Wednesday, a group of senators led by Sen. Barbara Boxer introduced the Protecting Children from Electronic Cigarette Advertising Act to prohibit the marketing of e-cigarettes to children. Such a bill would give the Federal Trade Commission the power to determine what constitutes inappropriate marketing to children, which would then be translated into a ban enforced by the FTC and states’ attorneys general. Despite the bill’s good intentions, its overly broad restrictions and sweeping assumptions over the influence of these e-cigarettes on the nation’s youth must be addressed.

The electronic cigarette, otherwise known as an e-cigarette, is a battery-powered device intended to imitate the experience of smoking without the harmful health effects. For habitual smokers, e-cigarettes both look and work like normal cigarettes. Unlike cigarettes made with tobacco leaves, however, e-cigarette users inhale and exhale liquid nicotine in the form of vapor, thereby avoiding both the harmful carcinogens and second-hand smoke of traditional cigarettes.
This safer nicotine fix, marketed as a healthier alternative for habitual smokers who wish to quit smoking cigarettes, has come with scrutiny. Proponents of the bill proposed by Sen. Boxer and others have attacked e-cigarette companies’ marketing tactics, which include celebrity advertisements and the marketing of fruity flavors, which they consider to be too appealing to youths.
“It is troubling that manufacturers of e-cigarettes — some of whom also make traditional cigarettes — are attempting to establish a new generation of nicotine addicts through aggressive marketing that often uses cartoons and sponsorship of music festivals and sporting events,” Sen. Tom Harkin said in a statement.
Though concerns regarding the health of the nation’s youth are valid, the proposed legislation doesn’t properly address these issues. Rather than calling for traditional restrictions imposed on other addictive substances such as tobacco and alcohol, the bill instead calls for manipulating the ways in which these products are marketed.
Such restrictions on advertising have failed in the past. In the 2001 case of Lorillard Tobacco v. Reilly, the Supreme Court found that advertising restrictions on tobacco products aimed at protecting impressionable youth were, in fact, too broad. As was in the case in Lorillard, denouncing e-cigarette advertisements for marketing different flavors, hiring celebrities and using cartoons is absurd, and such limitations would be too broad to ever be truly enforced.
Like any other product that deals with serious substances such as caffeine and alcohol, consumers should be advised of the consequences associated with nicotine. But to impose advertising restrictions banning the use of cartoons and varied nicotine flavors out of fear that it will sway the impressionable younger generation is absurd. Advertisers utilize different flavors and celebrity cameos to market products proven to be more dangerous, including alcohol and tobacco. To attempt to impose these unenforceable limitations on e-cigarettes doesn’t solve the problem these senators seek to address — it just creates additional ones.

Though electronic cigarettes are a hot trend, one thing is for sure: They shouldn’t be on the rise among youth. On Wednesday, five U.S. senators introduced legislation to prohibit marketing of electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes, to children and teens. The Protecting Children from Electronic Cigarette Act, penned by Sen. Barbara Boxer, addresses the important need of regulating what can and cannot be marketed to the nation’s young.

Though advocates of e-cigarettes have lauded the device for helping smokers quit, the unknown long-term effects and potential nicotine addiction could ironically be the younger generation’s gateway into smoking actual cigarettes. The duty to shield youth from e-cigarette advertising might be difficult due to the ambiguity of the lines between what targets youth and what doesn’t, but the lives saved early on make it worthwhile.
The e-cigarette is a battery-operated device that converts cartridges of liquid filled with addictive nicotine, other additives and flavorings into vapor that is inhaled by the user. Since it’s still new, e-cigarettes are not yet subject to federal laws and regulations that apply to traditional cigarettes. Such restrictions include a ban on marketing to youth, legal sale to children and age verification laws.
U.S. Sens. Boxer, Dick Durbin, Tom Harkin, Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey proposed the legislation in hopes of counteracting these risks. More than 1.8 million middle and high school students say they tried e-cigarettes in 2012, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey.
“We cannot risk undoing decades of progress in reducing youth smoking by allowing e-cigarette makers to target our kids,” Boxer said in a statement. “This bill will help protect our children from an industry that profits from addiction.”
From the use of celebrity endorsements to the promotion of varied fruit and candy flavors in e-cigarette advertising, the senators behind the legislation cited the youth-geared promotion that makes such a bill ultimately necessary.
“Tobacco companies advertising e-cigarettes — with flavors like bubble gum and strawberry — are clearly targeting young people with the intent of creating a new generation of smokers, and those that argue otherwise are being callously disingenuous,” Sen. Blumenthal said in a statement.
Though critics of the bill might call it overbroad, the issue is easily resolved by narrowing down the specifics and components of advertisements that are clearly geared toward youth. The bill itself doesn’t list restrictions. Determining of where to draw the line could be tailored to specific ads in a more effective, purpose-driven way.
It isn’t unconstitutional for the government to hold interest in alleviating the effects of tobacco advertising on such impressionable consumers. In fact, e-cigarrettes might be more dangerous than traditional cigarettes precisely because of their flavor appeal, accessibility and unknown health effects.
It might be difficult to suppress all marketing from e-cigarette companies targeting children, but this is a worthy effort for a cause that concerns many young lives who depend on the decisions of today’s leaders.

When I was a kid, smoking never entered into my mind as an option because I had PARENTS that I knew would kick my butt if they ever saw me take a puff. They raised me to understand the dangers and so the stinky smoking thing never took purchase with me. The point is NO AMOUNT OF LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME IMPACT AS RESPONSIBLE PARENTS LAYING BOUNDARIES FOR KIDS. If these politicians are truly interested in kids and interested in solving the problems of society at large – then they should focus on the fact that more and more stupid people are cranking out kids that they do not parent. I am tired of the government becoming larger every election cycle because some mealy-mouthed politician is trying to pick on issues that they can stick kids on the poster and pretend they actually care. let’s put PARENTS back on the hook for raising their own kids and let’s stop POLITICIANS from thinking they can constantly (s)mother us to death.
