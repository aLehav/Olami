Panelists Dee Dee Myers and Jon Macks joined Bob Shrum for a discussion about how the entertainment industry can shape politics through representation of different lifestyles. (Joseph Su | Daily Trojan)
Prominent figures in the entertainment and politics industries came together on Tuesday at Tommy’s Place to discuss how entertainment affects the political atmosphere of America. 
The discussion was part of a weekly series sponsored by the Department of Political Science and was moderated by Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics  director Bob Shrum. 
Dee Dee Myers, who served as White House Press Secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Jon Macks, a Hollywood writer and producer, spoke on the panel.
The discussion covered how Hollywood and politics intersect, particularly through political television programs such as “The West Wing” and “House of Cards,” and talk shows like Jay Leno’s and John Oliver’s. 
Macks spoke about the relationship between news and late-night comedy shows. He said that recently, the relationship has changed in that the premise of the jokes are no longer necessarily factual. Late-night comedy shows have evolved into a “source of humor.”
“In a sense, you could get the news and then you could get the jokes,” Macks said. “Today, people are getting opinions more than they are getting the news.” 
The discussion covered how monolithically partisan Hollywood is. Macks said that while she worked at “The Tonight Show,” there were two Republican writers on a staff of 18. 
“Creative people are inherently not conservative,” Myers said. “I think that’s part of the reason why communities like Hollywood are more progressive …  The creative instinct is to look at things a different way and that’s part of why there isn’t a conservative analogue.”
Shrum said that in 2016, Hillary Clinton campaigned with a string of celebrities, and posed the question about whether it was helpful or hurtful. Myers said it was “mostly hurtful.”
“I don’t think it’s good for the politicians, and it’s generally not good for the celebrities,” Myers said. “They politicize themselves and divide their audiences.” 
Myers and Macks both agreed that celebrities’ involvement in causal campaigns can have a beneficial impact instead of a detrimental one. Myers said the effect on celebrities’ image is different for causal campaigns, like the #MeToo movement.
 “#MeToo was born in Hollywood and grew out of the behaviors that came out of Hollywood,” Myers said.” For women celebrities to step forward and hold the industry and the system accountable is a little different.” 
When discussing the overall impact of Hollywood on American politics, Myers said that Hollywood has a “tremendous impact” on culture, which  affects politics. 
“There is no question that when you start to see something in your living room it becomes normal,” Myers said. “I think that starts to give people context to start thinking differently about LGBT people [and] colored people who have not necessarily been in their lives. That is very powerful.”

BSA co-Director Nia Warren said violence would not stem from protests. (Lillian Zeng | Daily Trojan)
Student leaders launched into an emotional discussion during Tuesday’s senate meeting, after the Office of Campus Activities decided to not revoke funding for an event featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.
The Office found that Young Americans for Freedom’s decision to cancel specific students’ tickets did not violate university rules. According to Director of Campus Activities Gabriel Valenzuela, there has not been a change of status regarding USG’s funding of the event, which will be held Thursday at Bovard Auditorium. 
YAF received $4,100 from the Undergraduate Student Government’s Discretionary Fund. According to the fund’s guidelines, events that receive discretionary funding must be free and open to all undergraduate students. Last week, multiple student assembly leaders expressed their concern with YAF’s decision to cancel students’ tickets, arguing that the event’s funding should be revoked.
Sen. Max Geschwind initiated a discussion about the event and the controversy surrounding the ticket cancellations during Tuesday’s meeting, noting how he had never seen a conservative speaker at USC.
“The notion of intellectual diversity and diversity of thoughts and ideas is frequently seen as an invalid form of diversity,” Geschwind said. “It’s unacceptable, shameful and goes against everything college stands for to present a one-sided view of political issues facing this country.”
Sen. Michaela Murphy then asked YAF Chairman Maxwell Brandon why the group canceled certain students’ reserved tickets, adding that allotting $1,000 for student protestors was “a consolation prize” for the cancellations. 
“It’s clear that there is racial profiling as a motivation,” Sen. Meagan Lane said to the Daily Trojan after the meeting. “It was stated that members of cultural assemblies who RSVP’d to protests were already known to have disagreement, which is a contradiction to what they say, because they say they want people to disagree and then they cancel the tickets of [those] who they had evidence of them disagreeing.”
Brandon explained that the organization had proof that students whose tickets were canceled planned to disrupt the event. He also said that the cancellations were not racially motivated.
“It’s not our fault if people get offended,” Brandon said. “We’re tired of having to tailor what we do around people that disagree with us … Regardless of what we do, those who disagree with us will never be happy, so we are going to do what we want to do, have it open to the best of our ability.”
BSA Assistant Director Mae Gates teared up while saying that the cancellation of her ticket was unacceptable.
“Up until now, I have definitely been silent about it. But now I feel the need to break that silence,” Gates said. “It’s unacceptable that I pay $64 a year and that money is going to someone who is not necessarily the most nice and the most light-hearted when it comes to racial issues, but also that I have to pay but continue to be unpaid [as a USG senate aide] to be disrespected.”
Brandon explained that YAF supported students’ right to peacefully protest, but that the organization would not allow for violent protests inside the event. He also explained that students who were upset with their tickets being canceled could have reached out to the organization.
Lane described her discontent toward Brandon’s reactions to people’s emotional responses about Shapiro and ticket cancellations.
“Your demeanor, your posture, your tone is kind of a slap in the face,” Lane said to Brandon. “People are out here putting their heart on their sleeve just to have a conversation … I would challenge you to take the mindset of listening.”
Black Student Assembly co-Director Nia Warren said that if violence did occur, it wouldn’t be from student protests.
“If you’re not bringing someone that’s violent, you’re bringing people in this crowd who are going to be incited by what he says to be violent,” Warren said. “Violence is not coming from our side.”
Shapiro is set to speak at Bovard Auditorium Thursday at 7 p.m. Protests of the event are also scheduled for the same day.

Trojan Support is led by a board of directors and 15 trained student volunteers. (Photo courtesy of Drew Hodis)
A USC student support group will launch in October to serve as a supplement to the Engemann Student Health Center’s counseling services.
In August, the center announced it would implement changes to students’ mental health needs by adding 10 new therapists, an effort to reduce the staff counselor to student ratio. But even with more staff and an updated policy, Trojan Support believes it can branch the divide between students’ hesitance in reaching out to Engemann health professionals and the crucial resources they need.
“It takes time out of your day and there’s a whole stigma behind going to talk to professionals,  especially with the recent issues at USC with Engemann,” said Trojan Support vice president and head of volunteers Gabrielle Van Der Velde-Kraft. “Not everybody trusts the school and wants to talk to someone at the professional services.” 
Trojan Support President and Founder Armand Amini decided to create the organization after realizing the need for a peer group for those uncomfortable with seeking professional help.
“[I wanted to provide a space] for individuals who want to speak with someone their own age [who] they can actually relate to at a similar time in their lives [and] they can feel comfortable [with],” Amini said.
The process to become a school-approved support group had its challenges. 
“In the first year or two, almost everyone shut me down immediately,” he said. “I got really, really discouraged. Those first five or six months at the end of the semester, I’d almost given up.”
The University hesitated to get involved to avoid potential liabilities, Amini said. Trojan Support worked with the health promotion strategy staff of USC Student Health. Health Promotion Specialist Andrea Moore, who was involved with advising Trojan Support, said that the group needed to shift its focus towards offering support, rather than counseling.
“The state of California has very specific legal meaning behind if you were calling yourself a counselor and you were providing counseling to other students,” Moore said. “We wanted to provide them with something that would help them become supporters of their peers but not necessarily counselors.”
Tania Tsao, Trojan Support’s head of student care, will handle the concerns of volunteers and ensure they are offering services according to protocol.
“We are expecting certain cases to be more serious than others and require a lot more caution when dealing with student information,” Tsao said. “[We want] to constantly find new ways to improve our services as well, but I think that comes with time and experience.”
With those mechanisms in place, the organization was approved by Chief Student Health Officer Sarah Van Orman, who became an advocate for the organization from that point on, said Van Der Velde-Kraft.
“I think that this organization would not exist without [Van Orman’s] help because of a lot of liability reasons and all of that,” Van Der Velde-Kraft said. “We needed their support throughout the entire process, and so because of Van Orman, it’s actually going to be an organization.”
But even with support, the organization faced months of delay by not having enough staff, Amini said.
Trojan Support began recruiting volunteers, even though they hadn’t received full campus approval. The group found 400 students that were interested, interviewed 40 and narrowed it down to 15 volunteers. 
“We’re looking for individuals with high emotional intelligence … We’re looking for diverse people,” Amini said.  “We wanted to have a group that represented USC itself and want all people … to be comfortable coming in.”
Over five days, including 12 hours of Certified Peer Education training, volunteers were trained to approach a range of scenarios — from alcohol abuse to suicidal ideation.
“I think it was a pretty solid crash course on diversity, mental health stuff like suicidal ideation [and] body image issues,” Tsao said. “It covered a large range of common mental health issues that happen within the higher education community.”
Speakers from Engemann and Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services came in to go over what they’ve seen on campus and in their own office to give the volunteers added preparedness for what to expect, according to Van Der Velde-Kraft.
Student Health Services may continue to support the organization in the future in the form of additional training depending on its success. While Trojan Support is a recognized student organization under Undergraduate Student Government, it is not directly sponsored by Engemann, Moore said.
“[Trojan Support is] recognized as a student organization and we were able to help with the training and getting them speakers,” she said. “Student Health doesn’t certify or sponsor student organizations.”
Trojan Support is currently focusing on spreading its mission to students and campus groups.
Once they open their doors, Trojan Support will welcome walk-ins and appointments. Students can schedule a session online and make specific requests if they want a volunteer who can speak to their individual experience. Students who walk in will be accommodated as soon as someone is available to see them.
“If someone wanted to talk to an individual that has been dealing with similar issues, they can always request that,” Amini said. “We’re not going to represent everything ever, but we’ve done our best to be able to talk about a wide range of potential issues.”
For issues that are beyond the capacity of peer support, the organization can refer the students to see a professional.
“We can’t replace [professional] counseling,” Van Der Velde-Kraft said. “We can help people and point them in the right direction and talk with them, but we aren’t official counselors, so I think that’s the big distinction to make.”

Jessie Chang | Daily Trojan
The news cycle has been exhausting for survivors who see ourselves in the women who have risked their lives, careers and identities to allege that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted them. The nastiness these women have shouldered — death threats, being forced from their homes for their own safety and receiving attacks by the most powerful man in the country — has offered a master class on why up to 90 percent of sexual assaults go unreported. 
It’s tempting to dedicate this column to a point-by-point examination of the facts that indicate the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez. It’s tempting to dive head-first into a rant about the cruelty survivors are subjected to and the gendered nature of credibility that places women in situations that include not being believed about our experiences with sexual abuse. But at this point, both routes feel pointless, unproductive and needlessly exhausting. I’m exhausted. 
You don’t have to testify before a predominantly old, white male Senate committee on national television to know how draining it is to try to prove basic realities to people who are never going to understand. People who don’t want to understand. People who have never shared your experience, and have no capacity for empathy. What I’ve come to discover and want to remind the decent people who believe Ford and survivors, is that it’s not the survivor’s job to prove their humanity to people who are unwilling to see, accept and respect it. It’s not their job to change the minds and hearts of — simply put — bad people. 
I’ve drawn on my own experiences with sexual harassment and abuse through the years, and I see my younger self so starkly in the high school girl Ford described herself as at the time of her assault. Taking care of myself and supporting the other survivors in my life has worn me to my core. On top of this, I don’t owe anyone my time and energy to offer explanations, or attempt to humanize survivors, whom decent people should already see as human beings. For all those who try to rationalize sexual assault and start debates out of malice and a twisted, child-like yearning to win an argument, I have no words. I owe you nothing. As survivors, we owe you nothing. 
It’s an oft-repeated line among well-meaning, progressive politicians that it’s our civic duty to have conversations with people we disagree with, to use polite, open-minded debate to advance what we believe in. Of course, there are always going to be polite, decent people you can disagree with and have productive debates with. There are plenty of neutral issues that can always be debated. But speaking for myself, there are issues that I am not going to degrade with debate. 
I am not going to debate veracity of survivors, who have nothing to gain and everything to lose in coming forward. And I’m certainly not going to waste my time debating people who are already determined to not believe survivors. 
I’m an adult woman who has shouldered slurs and attacks that I’m certain would send half the men who call me a “social justice warrior” or a “snowflake” into retirement. I’ve lived enough life to know that debating the realities of rape and misogyny is unequivocally beneath me.
To all the men who argue that accused men must be presumed innocent until proven guilty, what can survivors provide for you that would actually be enough “proof” for you? Most survivors who don’t experience penetrative rape can’t provide any DNA evidence, most don’t have witnesses or witnesses willing to testify. Many who do experience penetrative rape are so traumatized that the physically uncomfortable, invasive process of collecting a rape kit can be unbearable. The truth is, it’s often physically impossible for survivors to provide anything beyond their testimony. 
So, when it’s a survivor’s voice against a powerful man’s and you consistently find yourself believing the powerful man, find it in yourself to question why that is. Question the rigidity of your standards for believing someone who is risking it all to tell you they are in pain. I’ll be more than willing to debate when you can tell me what, exactly, survivors can provide you to prove their experience.

More than 1,500 Young Americans for Freedom chapters at colleges and universities nationwide have applied for the opportunity to host conservative author and commentator Ben Shapiro on his college campus tour. USC was one of the six schools selected, and it was announced in July that Shapiro was booked to speak at Bovard Auditorium on Thursday. 
However, over the past few weeks, I’ve noticed an increased awareness of Thursday’s event. There has been backlash leading to protests and demonstrations organized by Undergraduate Student Government’s cultural assemblies, planned counter-events by left-leaning political student groups, an endless supply of #SoundTheAlarm Instagram posts with faulty information and several op-eds in the Daily Trojan calling Shapiro “racist,” a “bigot” and a “white supremacist.”
The last critique is especially amusing, considering that a 2016 analysis conducted by the Anti-Defamation League found that Shapiro was the most frequent target of anti-Semitic attacks from white supremacists and the alt-right. And so, on the eve of Shapiro’s visit to campus, I see it as timely and necessary to provide an alternate perspective to Shapiro’s evening lecture at Bovard Auditorium, one much different to the largely one-sided point of view that some USC students have been exposed to. 
On Thursday, I fully intend on walking into Bovard Auditorium, taking a seat and attending Shapiro’s lecture. Attending does not denote a full agreement with everything that Shapiro stands for or believes in. Rather, my planned attendance of YAF’s event on Thursday represents an endorsement for the much-needed intellectual diversity — diversity of thoughts and ideas — that often goes unnoticed and disregarded by students and college campuses nationwide. 
I am in my senior year at USC, and this is the first time I can remember a high-profile conservative speaking on campus. That, to me, is unacceptable, shameful and goes against everything an institution of higher education stands for. Colleges and universities are supposed spaces meant to provoke, challenge and, yes, even offend. Challenging and uncomfortable discourse paves the way for students to  discover and solidify their personal political views. If universities leave students’ beliefs unchallenged during four of the most impressionable years of their life, they are doing them a disservice by allowing them to be intellectually complacent. 
In the past few years alone, the campus has had many outstanding speaker events from well-regarded liberals such as Gloria Steinem, Angela Davis, Barbara Boxer and just last week, Jose Antonio Vargas. Nearly all were supported by USG and faced little to no resistance or disruption from those who disagreed with these speakers. I can only hope that our fellow Trojans will give the same respect to Shapiro, who is exercising his constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of speech when he visits our campus tomorrow. 
I hope that they extend that respect to the students and guests attending YAF’s event and look forward to the protests and demonstrations planned by the Black Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly, the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and other motivated student activists looking to exercise their First Amendment right to assemble in expressing their disagreement with Shapiro. I commend YAF for accommodating protestors and ensuring that they will have a space on campus to gather and demonstrate.
Hate speech is not simply speech that you disagree with. Shapiro is not a “purveyor of hate speech,” as a viral post falsely pointed out. Trying to shut down someone’s speech with which you disagree is fascism. I’m supportive of Shapiro’s dissenters and the act of free assembly and protest. I encourage them to challenge him on Thursday: Call him out, put his feet to the fire and make him answer for his perceived controversial views. After all, college is  about confronting of opposing viewpoints. More speech, and differing speech, leads to the truth rising to the top. Shapiro seems to agree, as he is known for always insisting on having those that disagree with him to ask questions first during the Q&A portions of his events. So my anti-Shapiro friends, protest — but protest and challenge. Attend and participate.
In conclusion, putting political viewpoints aside, we are all Trojans. Let’s coexist peacefully and respectfully Thursday evening. For those attending and protesting, let’s be proud of the interactions we have with one another and keep them free of insults, innuendos, vulgarity and personal attacks. Those in and near Bovard Thursday will show if USC is able to handle the existence of opposing ideas in a compact space. Will we be known for being peaceful, courteous and civil? Or will we be seen as disruptors, insolent and unable to hear thoughts with which we disagree with? Whichever pathway we choose Thursday as student leaders on campus, and as Trojans, will have ramifications in the days, weeks, months and perhaps years to come. My only wish is that we choose the former.
I look forward to seeing you Thursday. Let’s have a discussion.
Max Geschwind, ‘19
USG Senator

Named after Bessie Smith’s 1927 performance “Muddy Waters,” Karon Davis’ plaster-covered exhibition at Wilding Cran Gallery exemplifies the struggles that victims of natural disasters face. The show is inspired by the consequences of climate change, including the displacement of underprivileged communities. 
“I started thinking about black bodies being affected by brown water, displaced by brown water, our relationship with water…” Davis told the Los Angeles Times. 
Davis came up with the idea for the collection after she and her son were forced to evacuate from her home in Ojai, Calif. as a during of the Thomas Fire. 
“We had been planning a different exhibit together initially,” said Anthony Cran, the owner of Wilding Cran Gallery. “She couldn’t go back to her home for three months; so, the idea from the show changed because of that.”
Davis’ work is placed front and center in the narrow space. The eight pieces comprising “Muddy Waters” are displayed in an oval shape in the foresection of the gallery. As a unit, the pieces are meant to appear immersed in a flood. 
The first structure represents “Moses,” leading his people through this migration with his staff in hand. The wooden staff breaks from Davis’ white plaster aesthetic, but brings a certain heaviness to the work. Behind “Moses,” “Blue Boy” towers elegantly, inspired by Thomas Gainsborough’s painting “The Blue Boy.” Beside him is a mailbox, floating in the water, half drowned. 
A few of the sculptures were inspired by images Davis had seen online of natural disasters victims in cities like Houston and New Orleans, according to Cran. 
“God Bless Preston,” was inspired by an image she saw of a man trying to catch hold of a stop sign in Houston. The man barely grips on with one arm as the rest of his body is forced away by a natural force, represented by the thick layers of plaster. 
Davis placed herself within the collection as well, with “Beth and Solomon.” The sculpture depicts a boy helping a woman out of the water. Cran said this represents Davis’ son guiding the way as she tries to keep up with him. Davis also includes a depiction of her evacuation — “Noah and His Ark” is an intricate piece showing two women in a boat filled with their belongings, as they are led by a portly man. The man pulls the boat along as one of the women holds her belongings to her chest, and the other sits legs wide apart, indifferent. Among the items in the boat is a candle stand and other decorative household items. 
Though all of these pieces depict devastating situations, they are followed by a sense of promise. The sculpture “Mami Wata” displays a woman carrying a water jug above her head. The jug is full of clean water, which Cran says symbolizes hope at the end.
As an addition to the “Muddy Waters” exhibit, Davis pays 
tribute to Hurricane Katrina in the sculpture “George Bush Doesn’t Care About Black People” (and Neither Does Trump). The work depicts two children on a roof surrounded by yellow wallpaper and a small sculpture of a shark fin at the bottom.
Through her signature plaster and wire sculptures, Davis accurately represents the impact of a natural disaster, especially since she has been through one herself. The intricacies of this collection are impressive; using personal tragedy and creativity, Davis recreates famous photos and paintings through her eyes and lived experiences. Taking from biblical to present day accounts of natural disasters, Davis uses the evocative white plaster to retell the stories of those who have endured such calamities and bring them back to present day. “Muddy Waters” is a moving, timely and relevant exhibit, one that demonstrates increasingly concerning environmental issues that continue to plague the U.S.
The exhibit will be on view at Wilding Cran Gallery until Nov. 4.

No matter whether the trees outside are barren, draped in verdancy or gilded in brilliant flames — no matter what time of year it is, it seems we are always wallowing neck-deep in a season designed to induce stress over our professional prospects — “application season,” “recruiting season,” “internship season.” We are all trapped on this rollicking merry-go-round, clinging onto those precious documents that showcase what meager assets we have to offer: resumes, cover letters, letters of recommendation. 
It is the last that has always concerned me, because with the competitive spirit growing more feverish by the day, my professors could not possibly provide a personalized ringing endorsement unless I make a concerted effort to stop by office hours and schmooze, which is not in my nature. And if the endorsement just ends up being a Mad Libs game, then what even is the point?  
My fears were somewhat allayed and exacerbated by reading “Dear Committee Members,” Julie Schumacher’s wildly funny epistolary novel. The book comprises letters of recommendation written by Jason Fitger, a professor of creative writing and literature at Payne University, an aptly-monikered liberal arts college in the Midwest. Fitger is, to put it lightly, a pompous blowhard, beset by a multitude of woes.
One floor above, the economics department is getting a full facelift with all the works, while the English department hasn’t seen a single nip tuck since its installation. To add insult to injury, Fitger is forced to contend with all the asbestos and noise pollution, while inhaling the aromas of the restroom next door. 
His first book was a firework, his second a firecracker and his third a sparkler — each one fizzling until his latest was practically a candle. Fitger needs a big splash, especially since he’s in the running for a promotion, for which his superiors are skeptical of  his merit. 
His relationship with another faculty member has recently disintegrated, in part because he preferred to remain noncommittal while sharing a Keurig and an apartment with her. He wants to keep things civil — she less so — until he’s faced with a letter of recommendation request from her as she transfers to another institution. 
The apple of his eye, a student named Darren Browles who has written a Melville-esque novel of epic proportions, can’t seem to catch a break with publishers, writers conferences or the world, really. Fitger’s glowing letters all lead to dead ends, but it’s certainly not because Browles’ work is aimless, disjointed or incoherent.  
“Dear Committee Members” is at times forlorn and occasionally pitiful, but mostly just very, very funny. It won the Thurber Prize for American Humor: But the true testament to its comedic value is the fact that it actually made me perform that ubiquitous, yet rarely accomplished acronym — LOL. “Dear Committee Members” made me want to escape academia as soon as possible, and send my poor professors, who I’m sure are equally beleaguered, an edible arrangement. It is with great pleasure that I find myself recommending this book.

Susan Park’s mission for Revolutionario North African Tacos is simple: If you walk in, you eat.
“If somebody comes and they can’t afford to eat and they tell me they’re hungry, I can always give them chicken, rice, vegetables, and a drink,” Park said. 
The walls of her restaurant  are covered with words of praise and support from customers, scribbled in multi-colored Sharpie. For Park, the walls are proof that the restaurant she runs with her husband on West Jefferson Boulevard is accessible to people from all cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds.
“In any given day or week if you just sat here and saw the customers, you’ve never seen a more diverse space,” Park said. 
 Revolutionario stands at a crossroads in its food. It introduces North African cuisine with a uniquely Southern California twist. 
 “I know that from experience … it’s very globally appealing food,” Park said. “It’s entry-level foreign food for just about anybody because it’s going to remind somebody of something.”
Naiya Ross | Daily Trojan
 Park and her husband, Farid Zadi, a classically trained chef  born in France to Algerian parents, opened Revolutionario North African Tacos in 2015. 
Park — who is a food historian and chef — was born in South Korea and moved to Los Angeles when she was five years old. Together, the couple set out to combine North African and Latino cuisines through the lens of Los Angeles.
“In terms of food culture, the idea makes sense to me because Arabized Northwest Africans … conquered Spain and ruled it for over 700 years, so there is a lot of culinary influence, and the Spanish brought that to the Americas,” Park said.
The chicken tagine taco epitomizes this culinary ombination: A small tortilla comes loaded with pieces of chicken that are slightly lemony and perfectly spiced. 
“It was just kind of a natural marriage,” Park said. “The food tastes good together and … there are already things that exist in Mexican and Latin American cooking that are influenced by North Africa, so it just works.” 
Revolutionario’s meats are halal, meaning they’re prepared in the Islamic tradition — a conscious decision that Park made in order to appeal to a wider range of religious backgrounds while adhering to the food’s North African roots. 
“I wanted to make a point … to be inclusive and make a sociopolitical statement,” she said. “You can do something that’s for other people and be inclusive. You don’t have to be a part of that group necessarily to do something nice.”
But Park doesn’t limit herself to making tacos — and with her customers’ trust, she allows herself to be creative.
“Our customers just say, ‘Make whatever you feel like,’” Park said. “‘We know it’s good.’”

There is no reason why the best teams should not be rewarded with the best position in the playoffs. Whether that be baseball, basketball or football, it makes the most sense from both ratings and a practical point of view for the teams with the winningest records to be put into a position where they can continue to last long in the playoffs.
The New York Yankees, who finished the season with 100 wins and the third best record in baseball, shouldn’t be put into a place where they face a must-win Wild Card Game to make it into the playoffs. There is also no reason that if they win that game, they would have to play a Boston Red Sox team with 108 wins. The Red Sox should have an easy pathway to making the World Series because they finished the season with the most wins, yet they will still have to face another World Series favorite in the Yankees.
This system puts an emphasis on divisional play; however, it is also unfair for divisions that consistently perform at an elite level. The Yankees and Red Sox typically have the highest payroll and invest the most money into their respective teams, which is why they are always in the running in October. Yet, one of these two teams has to play a one-off game every year because they face each other.
Most people would agree that the best teams deserve to be in the playoffs and that they want to watch the best teams in the postseason. But with the current system in place, the best teams will not stay in the playoffs for an extended period of time, and the World Series will not consist of the two best teams.
The same can be said about basketball. The Western Conference has recently consisted of two teams that deserve to be in the NBA Championship. Last season, the Houston Rockets and the Golden State Warriors were the two best teams, but were pinned against each other in the Western Conference Championship instead of the Finals. 
The NBA Finals is obviously more watched than the Western Conference Finals. Yet, the better series last year was the one between the Rockets and the Warriors, not the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Warriors. And still, people were forced to watch the Cavs in the Finals instead of the Rockets because of this playoff system.
Fans deserve to watch the two best teams play in the Finals. Teams deserve to be rewarded for their regular season success and not be punished because of where they are geographically located in the country.
NBA commissioner Adam Silver said that it makes no sense to break up conferences and seeding because of where teams are geographically located. While it would be hard for two teams across the country to play each other in a best of seven series, it should not be the sole reason for preventing fairness in sports.
These players and organizations are getting paid millions of dollars to compete and entertain fans. At the end of the day, the players can put up with a little bit of extra travel to give the fans the best source of entertainment and declare a fair winner.
As a fan, I want the opportunity to watch the Red Sox and Yankees face each other at the highest stage in baseball instead of barely scraping into the playoffs, because they are both much better than the rest. At the end of the day, people want to see the best teams compete against each other in the championship, and right now, that is not the case. This MLB postseason is poised to be an entertaining one because of the level of talent. Yet, record-wise, the American League is better than the National League, but the American League teams will have to grind against each other before the World Series. This could mean whichever team comes out of the AL will probably be worn down by the time they face the worse NL team, and that doesn’t make for the best World Series.

Senior libero Victoria Garrick has recorded 1,312 career digs, recently passing April Ross’s USC record. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
After playing 10 of 11 of its last games on the road, the women’s volleyball team will finally host its next four games at Galen Center. Currently undefeated at home (4-0), the No. 12 Trojans will have their first set of home games that will test home court advantage against Oregon State on Thursday and Oregon on Sunday.
“Having that fan base at home is really easy to play in and get pumped up for,” sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin said. “On the road you’re tired, your sleep schedule is messed up and then you have to perform in front of people who are cheering against you.”
They plan to use the home energy to drive their game.
“There is absolutely an advantage in playing at home,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “Who knows what that is, if it’s rest, or if it’s just more in your comfort zone, or that you’ve got people cheering for you instead of against you?”
 The Trojans average 14.0 kills, 13 assists and 1.6 aces per set, while their opponents are averaging 13.5 kills, 12.7 assists and 1.1 aces per set. The averages may not appear to be that decisive, but  aces and kills can especially impact a game.
 “In terms of getting the kind of wins we want and what the scores should look like, we spent a lot more time on that [on Monday] and we will in the next few days to hopefully get back to where we were,” Crouch said.
Serving alone will not stop either team from attempting to take control of Galen Center. Oregon State will come in with fire as it seeks its first Pac-12 conference win after falling in its first four games. With sophomore libero Grace Massey locking in the Beavers defense with 290 digs already this season, it will be up to USC’s hitters to find the holes and capitalize on them when they can.
“What we do before every match is we show our team how they’re going to defend certain play types, and all of our hitters know these are the shots that are going to score,” Crouch said. “If [they are] in trouble they have their outs … they know [they] can put it here and it is going to create a lot of trouble.”
After taking on Oregon State, the Trojans will then regroup and face Oregon, which is currently 2-2 in conference play. Oregon will pose a different challenge than Oregon State as the Ducks’ two leading hitters rival the numbers of USC’s own. For the Trojans, outside hitters sophomore Brooke Botkin and junior Khalia Lanier have had 246 and 238 kills, respectively, this season. While the Trojans’ stats still dominate, Ducks’ junior middle blocker Ronika Stone and senior outside hitter Lindsey Vander Weide have tallied up 164 and 163 kills, respectively. 
“They usually run a fast offense with a lot of combinations, so serving is the answer for that,” Crouch said. “I just want to serve them tough enough so they can’t run any of that stuff.”
While Oregon State is unranked and Oregon is ranked No. 20, these are still important games.
“We want to play the same regardless of what the ranking is or what the standings are,” Crouch said. “I think every team in the Pac-12 can beat any other team [on] any given night. Everybody’s really good, so we talk about trying to maintain that level of consistency and the same energy level.”

USC’s defense celebrates after shutting out Arizona in the first half last weekend. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
After a nail-biting win following a last-minute comeback attempt by Arizona, the football team is on a bye week before taking on Colorado at home. On Tuesday, USC held the first of its two practices on its week off.
The team, especially the defense, focused heavily on conditioning and controlling fatigue, something that almost cost the Trojans the game down the stretch as they allowed 20 unanswered points to Arizona in the final quarter and a half. Numerous injuries, most notably to senior captain and offensive lineman Porter Gustin (knee) have forced defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast to experiment with different lineups in practice before throwing them out on gameday. 
The most crucial, as Pendergast alluded to, are the absences of sophomore safety Bubba Bolden, who has not suited up this year for undisclosed reasons, and redshirt freshman safety Isaiah Pola-Mao, out for the year after injuring his shoulder against Stanford in Week 2. Despite the challenges, Pendergast has been impressed from what he’s seen from other players stepping up in practice.
“I think we’re finally developing some continuity, particularly in the secondary,” Pendergast said. “I like playing a lot of the same guys together, and particularly in the back seven, where they can kind of get a feel working together. It’s been tough for [senior safety Marvell Tell III] because he hasn’t really been able to settle in with one safety that he can play with the majority of the time.”
However, Pendergast singled out freshman safety Talanoa Hufanga as one player who he particularly believes is ready to take on a greater role.
“It’s pretty much proven now that Hufanga can be that guy, so I think that is the 1-2 punch there at safety that I’m excited about, continuing to grow as the season grows,” Pendergast said. “Now that the season’s moving on, that I think will help the whole defense.”
Tell has led the Trojans in tackles every single game this year. For him to get consistent help from his fellow defensive backs and develop chemistry will help make sure that the defense can sustain the level of production it did through the first two and a half quarters against the Wildcats. 
Freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele believes that the Trojans have proven that they can execute their game plan, and that they’ll only continue to improve as the intangibles start to develop.
“The whole week we were just emphasizing on defense that we were gonna stop the run,” Tufele said. “All of the stuff we were doing in practice that we were working on, it was all leading up to that, and I think we did a great job on Saturday proving that we could be efficient on stopping the run.”
Sophomore defensive lineman Brandon Pili concurred with Tufele.
“We prepped for them all week,” Pili said. “We knew they had a looser back, we knew they had a solid O-line, and we just prepared how we usually prepare for run heavy teams. We just went out there and did our thing.”
Helton gets back to the basics
Head coach Clay Helton is taking advantage of the bye week to resolidify his team’s foundation and principles.
“[We] really concentrated on not as much scheme work, but fundamentals, techniques and things that we need to improve individually,” Helton said. “There was a lot of individual time, some good competition in one-on-one, in team run and then some development on some of those players that are just on the edge, that are just one-snap away from being starters with injuries.” 
Helton as a whole was pleased with his defense’s play in stopping a very dynamic Arizona offense.
“Our goal was to go in the game, stop the running game … but make it one-sided where the quarterback had to play and had to be a thrower,” Helton said. “To limit the explosive plays — they were a seven -yard play per team average team, a very explosive team … it was really a shutout in the first half.”
Helton attributed the defense’s gritty performance to one key theme: discipline.
“The problem that people were having was somebody would take the bait, get out of their gap, and when [Arizona running back JJ] Taylor hits a hole, he is gone,” Helton said. “I thought the discipline of gap integrity … held firm all night on it. I was really proud of them.”
Injury Update
Gustin is nursing an ankle injury. His status is unknown until next week. 
Redshirt junior inside linebacker John Houston Jr. is dealing with a neck injury. He will be reevaluated on Monday.
Freshman cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart suffered a high ankle sprain. He will be out for several weeks.

The 6-foot, 205-pound Hartsell hit .396 with 110 RBIs for his high school career.
Right-handed pitchers Chandler Champlain (No. 34) and Ethan Reed (No. 39) round out the Trojans’ top-40 prospects.

Chaplain also has a large national profile; he played for Team USA youth teams from 2014-17 and was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels in the 38th round of the MLB Draft.
Reed, the fourth-ranked pitcher in California, was a two-sport athlete at Aliso Niguel High School in Laguna Niguel. At 6-foot-4-inches and 200 pounds, Reed was dominant both on the mound and the hardwood; along with winning a league basketball championship, Reed was named to the All-South Coast League team in his junior and senior seasons.
The final Trojan freshman ranked in the top 100 by Perfect Game was Emilio Rosas. Rosas, a Mater Dei product who comes in at No. 54, is the fifth-ranked shortstop in California and 20th-ranked at the position nationally. The Rawlings Pre-Collegiate All-American hit 367 with a .405 on-base percentage in his junior and senior seasons, joining Champlain on the All-Trinity League team.
Carson Lambert and Calvin Schapira, the No. 319 and No. 321 pitchers in the nation respectively, fill out the pitching rotation. Lambert posted a 1.44 ERA and recorded 147 strikeouts in 165 innings over three seasons at Newbury Park High School in Thousand Oaks, Calif. His 0.86 ERA as a junior set a single-season record and was the back-to-back Marmonte League Pitcher of the Year in 2017 and 2018.
