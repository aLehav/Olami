Competing on the road for the first time this season at the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic in Springfield, Mass., the Trojans earned a convincing win against New Mexico State on Sunday after a gut-wrenching loss to Bradley the day before.

Playing motivated after losing the first two games of the tournament, the Trojans (3-2) jumped out to a 17-5 lead against New Mexico State and held on to defeat the Aggies, 80-61. USC held New Mexico State (2-3) to a 35.7 shooting percentage and forced 18 turnovers.
Freshman guard Bryce Jones scored 21 points, the highest total in his first five collegiate games. Junior forward Nikola Vucevic added 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Senior guard Marcus Simmons had 12 points and six rebounds.
The blowout victory allowed USC coach Kevin O’Neill to play walk-ons redshirt junior guard James Dunleavy, sophomore guard Daniel Munoz, junior guard Eric Strangis and redshirt freshman guard Tyler Sugiyama for the first time this season.
On Saturday, USC came within seconds of the victory. The Trojans were up 31-23 at halftime and led the entire second half until Bradley (4-0) commandeered the lead with 58 seconds left in the game. In the final seconds, the Trojans led 63-61, but Simmons fouled the Braves’ Sam Maniscalco on a 3-point attempt with .3 seconds left in the game, allowing Maniscalco to make three free throws to give Bradley the victory, 64-63.
Two Trojans starters — Simmons and senior forward Alex Stepheson — combined to score only four points in the game, while freshman guard Maurice Jones had the worst game of his young collegiate career, missing all 10 of his shots and turning the ball over five times.
USC’s two-man bench rotation kept the Trojans in the game. Senior guard Donte Smith made four 3-point baskets, and freshman forward Garrett Jackson scored 12 points after recording a combined two points in his first three collegiate games.
Vucevic led the Trojans with a career-high 22 points and 15 rebounds against the Braves but missed two key free throws with 11 seconds left in the game and the Trojans leading 63-61. Bryce Jones contributed 13 points, five assists and five steals.

When junior driver Peter Kurzeka recorded his 29th goal of the season on a shot that sailed past UC Irvine goalie Matt Johnson midway through the second quarter at Anteater Pool on Saturday, his coach resisted the urge to grin.
For the score · Junior driver Peter Kurzeka was one of four Trojans to score two goals Saturday against UC Irvine. Overall, seven players scored for USC and goalkeeper Joel Dennerley notched 12 saves. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
Kurzeka’s shot gave USC a comfortable 7-2 first-half lead, but instead of issuing a congratulatory message, USC coach Jovan Vavic remained emphatic about his young team maintaining its five-goal margin.
“It was very important for us to get off to a quick start,” Vavic said. “We never wanted Irvine to be close to us in the fourth quarter because they’re all the more dangerous at home.”
Vavic’s demands were met as the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (23-2, 6-2) defeated No. 6 UC Irvine (16-7, 4-4) by a six-goal margin, 11-5, as Kurzeka, along with freshman driver Nikola Vavic, redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal and sophomore utility Mace Rapsey, each recorded a pair of goals on the afternoon. It was a balanced effort in the team’s regular season finale that allowed the Trojans to stave off a second-half run by the Anteaters.
“We really don’t rely on one person, and that’s the strength of our team,” Vavic said. “We really have so many guys who can score.”
And the numbers prove it.
So far in 2010, the Trojans have watched eight of their players record at least 20 goals, a remarkably balanced attack for a team that continues to average at least 13 goals per contest. Predictably, Saturday’s showing was no different.
“Offensively we did a good job,” Vavic said. “We scored on quite a few six-on-fives, and overall we did a good job. Eleven goals is a very good offensive performance. Any time you get at least eight or nine goals, that’s good.”
And with the postseason set to begin in less than a week, the Trojans received uplifting performances from some of their older, more experienced players.
Both Kurzeka and Rosenthal have been members of the Trojans’ last two national championship teams, which combined for a total of just two losses in two seasons.
“It’s really important for our leaders to play well because our team feeds off of them,” Vavic said.
But if the first half belonged to the offense, credit the defense for a similarly strong performance in the second half.
Despite a pair of five-meter penalty shots from UC Irvine, which had only lost at home once in 2010, the Trojan defense, anchored by junior goalie Joel Dennerley, surrendered just three second-half goals.
Dennerley has been in goal for both of USC’s NCAA championship seasons in 2008 and 2009, yet Vavic said  he is ahead of where he was in seasons prior in terms of ability and experience.
“Joel is more mature,” Vavic said. “He has played well in every big game for us. I think that Joel, with every game, brings a whole lot to our defense. I’ve always seen him play well in big games. He really doesn’t make mistakes.”
And with the Trojans’ upcoming slate of games, he won’t be afforded an opportunity to do so.
Coupled with No. 1 California’s 9-6 win over No. 5 Stanford, USC sewed up the second seed in next week’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament in Palo Alto, Calif., with a matchup against No. 7-seed UC Santa Barbara on Friday for a spot in the semifinals.
“There are no easy games,” Vavic said. “I’ve never been a part of a season in which so many teams are equally matched. I think everybody is dangerous, and you can’t relax.”

With just one game left in the regular season, the No. 6 Women of Troy locked up a third place finish in the Pac-10 standings after defeating No. 23 Oregon and Oregon State on the road this weekend. This is the second time USC has beaten each of these teams this year.
Focused · USC freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana helped the Women of Troy beat Oregon in five sets with 22 kills and seven digs. - Jesse Bowman | Daily Trojan 
USC (24-4, 13-4) started out strong at Oregon (18-10, 6-10) Saturday night, winning the first two sets, 25-19, 25-23, and moving out to an early 2-0 lead.
“I thought we intimidated them,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We passed really well, and we hit with more firepower.”
But the lead didn’t last. Oregon battled back, largely thanks to outside hitter Alaina Bergsma, who led the team with 19 kills. The Ducks won the next two games, 25-21, 29-27, forcing the match to a fifth set.
“I think they had a spirited halftime talk and really came out on fire, and then we started to fade a little bit in our concentration,” Haley said, referring to his team’s youth. Haley has six freshmen on his team and played five of them on Saturday.
Saturday’s match marked the final game the Ducks will play at McArthur Court, and it was also the team’s Senior Night.
“They had reason to do all kinds of good things, and you know, we weathered through that and didn’t quit,” Haley said.
After going down 4-2 in the final set, USC went on a 4-1 run, giving the Women of Troy a 6-5 lead. They never looked back, ending the game on a 5-1 run and winning the fifth set and the match, 15-9.
Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana led the Women of Troy with 22 kills while also posting seven digs.
“Falyn is really coming on as a quality passer, and that really makes us a lot better,” Haley said.
Saturday’s match largely paralleled USC’s other encounter with the Ducks this season. The Women of Troy went up 2-0 on Oct. 22 at home before Oregon came back and pushed the match to five sets. The Women of Troy prevailed in the final game 15-10.
“When we played [Oregon] at our place, we had the same trouble, so we’re gonna have to battle against these guys the next two years because they’re young too,” Haley said.
On Friday night, USC faced off against Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore., and for the second time this season, the Women of Troy came away with a three-set sweep of the Beavers, 25-22, 25-19, 25-17.
Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led the team with 10 kills. Freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard recorded eight kills and one error, while junior middle blocker Lauren Williams had seven kills and zero errors. In the third game alone, the Women of Troy recorded 10 kills with just one unforced error.
Hitting errors — or more specifically a lack of hitting errors — was a big part of both matches for the Women of Troy this weekend. On Saturday, USC only recorded a total of 12 over the five sets.
“That’s less than three hitting errors a game. That’s an all-time record for this team,” said Haley, who later added, “I’m pretty pleased with what we’re doing, and the reduction of errors makes me feel really good.”
With the season coming to a close, every victory is huge for the Women of Troy.
“Any time you win, it helps your confidence, but they also get us closer to a very good bid in the NCAA tournament placement-wise,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy are certainly making a statement with their recent impressive play as they have won 10 of their last 11 matches.
“We’re right on task right now,” Haley said. “We’re getting better at the right time.”
The Women of Troy will play their final match of the regular season Friday at UCLA.

USC freshman tailback Dillon Baxter did not travel to Oregon State after accepting a ride in a golf cart from an NFLPA certified agent who is also a USC student.
A member of the USC compliance department saw Baxter riding in the golf cart with the logo of the 1st Round Enterprises on the side panel, USC Vice President of Compliance David M. Roberts said Saturday.
1st Round Enterprises, of which 1st Round Sports is a subsidy, is led by USC senior Teague Egan, who is the chairman and CEO. Egan is also a NFLPA-certified agent.
“We did nothing wrong, broke no rules and have never given any players anything,” Egan said in a text message Saturday night.
USC is hopeful Baxter will be reinstated this week after he pays the value of the ride, about $10, to a charity.
“We’re hoping that’s going to be the end of it and that the NCAA will understand that we acted proactively and quickly,” Roberts said.
Was there ever any explanation of the snub by Stanley Havili of Head coach during the introduction of seniors during the opening ceremonies vs. ND on saturday. Every other senior stoped, hugged , etc, Stanley ran right by the coach, no contact, no conversation. Very odd. Please respond. thanks
This guy Egan knows better. Student or not, stay away from the athletes!

The setup: Then-No. 20 USC came into Corvallis, Ore., fresh off a 24-21 win at then-No. 18 Arizona and looked to build off that momentum as the Trojans tried to break the Corvallis Curse, as they hadn’t won at Oregon State since 2004, after losing their last two games there when ranked No. 1 and No. 3.
A sorry sight · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley was helped off the field Saturday after suffering a high-ankle sprain during the second-to-last play of the first half on Saturday. The timetable for his return is unknown. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The story: Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley could be done for the season.
Barkley received a high-ankle sprain on his right foot after he was sacked on the second-to-last play of the first half. He was carted off the field and did not re-enter the game. He came out of the locker room in the second half with a walking boot on and using crutches.
“I don’t know the depth of the injury,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Obviously we’ll work to get him back but otherwise we got to move forward.”
Barkley said that being out for the remainder of the year is the last thing he wants to happen and did not know after the game if he will be able to play this week.
Down and out: USC got down early and never came back. Like the previous two losses, the Trojans dug themselves in a deep hole early. A pass from Barkley was intercepted and returned for a touchdown to put the Beavers up 10-0 early in the second quarter.
Seven minutes later, Oregon State running back Jacquizz Rodgers ran the ball in for a three-yard score to put Oregon State up 17-0. The Beavers tacked on a field goal before the half, creating a deep deficit that proved too much for the Trojans.
“The problem with [the interception] is that play happens and you have the feeling, ‘Here we go again,’” Kiffin said. “I’m sure everyone had that feeling. That’s the blueprint for coming in here and playing a team that hadn’t played well the last few weeks before. We handed them the ball and seven points.”
USC found itself in more trouble when Barkley injured his ankle.
As a result, senior backup quarterback Mitch Mustain led the Trojan offense in the second half and gave it some spark coming out of halftime. He led a drive that ended in a 13-yard touchdown run from senior running back C.J. Gable with three minutes left in the third quarter that brought the Trojans within 16.
On USC’s next possession, Mustain put together a nine-play drive but turned the ball over on downs after his pass fell incomplete to freshman receiver Robert Woods on fourth-and-four at the Beavers’ 46-yard line. That incomplete pass would be USC’s last chance to get back in the game as Oregon State scored a touchdown on its next possession to put the game out of reach.
Mustain finished with eight-for-17 passing for 60 yards.
“You can’t put a guy in a much worse situation,” Kiffin said. “On the road against a defense that’s playing really well that day, and we’re not playing great on offense anyway, and we’re down by much. But it was very good for Mitch’s experience especially because he might be our quarterback next week and the week after.”
Mustain said he didn’t feel much pressure going in and enjoyed competing with the outcome of the game still in limbo.
“It’s nice to be playing for something, per se,” Mustain said. “Not that it doesn’t always matter, you can put it on film, but this is different. This is a chance to get in with these guys and really make a difference. The hardest part for me especially is that we didn’t execute in times that could’ve helped us.”
The game was over when: USC walked into the stadium. Even with Barkley running the offense in the first half, he was inconsistent and couldn’t establish any rhythm. The farthest the Trojans ventured into Oregon State territory in the first half was on their first drive to the Beavers’ 26 yard-line, but redshirt junior running back Marc Tyler was stuffed on fourth-and-two.
“If you turn the ball over, don’t make many third downs, barely make any fourth downs and don’t get any turnovers, that’s what happens,” Kiffin said. “Obviously, our offense was terrible.”
The resurgence of Gable: For the first time this year, Gable saw extended playing time and was arguably the best Trojan on the field. After Tyler hurt his ankle in the first half, senior running back Allen Bradford dropped a pitch in the second quarter — and with freshman tailback Dillon Baxter absent after possible contact with a registered NFL agent — Kiffin gave Gable a shot.
Gable’s 56-yard kickoff return in the third quarter set up the Trojans’ only score  — his 13-yard touchdown run. He finished with 10 carries for a team-high 57 yards.
Key injuries: Several Trojans were injured in Saturday’s contest. Barkley went down with a high-ankle sprain, Tyler hurt his ankle, junior right tackle Tyron Smith hurt his knee and redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo suffered a concussion.
Galippo should be back next week but the timetable for the return of the other three players is unclear.

There was a lot to be said about the Trojans’ impressive win against Arizona two Saturdays ago.
But after a week of sub-par practices culminated in a shocking 36-7 upset loss to Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore., on Saturday, not many words remained.
“I don’t know what it is. I don’t know,” senior tailback C.J. Gable said, trying to answer why USC couldn’t seem to get it together.
Redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo failed in doing so as well.
“I have no idea,” he said.
Had you watched USC’s game on Saturday, you would realize how fitting this statement — or lack thereof — is.
Not only were the Trojans beat in Corvallis, they were blindsided, trampled and overrun. USC, a team that came into Saturday averaging 35.2 points per game, was held scoreless in the first half and limited to just seven points for the night.
In case you weren’t keeping track, neither of those things had happened to the Trojans since 2001. And in case you need reminding, this beat-down came not from a national contender, but from a team that had just fallen to Washington State at home by 17 points.
The Beavers looked nothing like anyone expected them to, and the Trojans were not the least bit ready for it, despite knowing full well that they were headed to Corvallis, the place where USC hopes go to die.
The win two Saturdays ago in Tucson, Ariz., was extremely promising for USC, which finally looked to be taking a step in the right direction as a program. But that victory gave the Trojans more than just some momentum and a whiff of a 10-win season — it gave them a distraction and a reason to be lackadaisical.
And Oregon State knew it was coming.
Chalk it up to whatever you want — poor coaching, missed opportunities, crowd noise, injuries — but at the end of the day, the Trojans suffered from a general lack of mental preparation.
This is not to say that USC coach Lane Kiffin and his staff didn’t get their team ready to play football — they did. The problem was they were ready to face typical circumstances, against a typical team, with a typical stadium and a typical coach.
If there is one thing the Trojans have learned in the last four years, it is that you don’t simply approach a game in the state of Oregon — where USC has now lost five years in a row — the way you approach other contests. Although there is no specific reason why this is so, historic evidence is just too overwhelming to think otherwise.
USC entered the game looking potent on its first drive, but a missed fourth-down-and-one conversion gave the Beavers just enough momentum to start a run, and the Trojans were not prepared to squash it before it overcame them. Soon, it was 20-0 at half, and visions of former USC quarterback Mark Sanchez and the No. 1 Trojans of 2008 began to creep into the back of people’s minds.
It didn’t help that USC was playing with backups at quarterback, tailback and linebacker for much of the second half. But at that point, it didn’t seem to matter.
So what is needed to finally break the Corvallis Curse?
For as much critique as I can give on the game, I have just as few answers for this curious Oregon State team. If there is one lesson to take into the Trojans’ next game there, it is to prepare to be tricked.
From now on, the Trojans will need to realize the team that takes the field opposite them might be very different from the one they prepared for or watched the week before on game film. It might not run the same offense, it might not make the same mistakes and it might not look capable of losing to the worst team in the Pac-10.
The team should have learned this lesson in 2008, and it certainly should now.
Until someone is able to come up with an answer better than “I don’t know,” this is a test that USC will continue to fail.

Saturday’s game against Oregon State was supposed to be then No. 20 USC’s chance to flex its newly toned muscles, take the next step toward the coveted 10-win season and ultimately break its four-year curse of losing in the state of Oregon.
Running wild · Oregon State junior running back Jacquizz Rodgers continued his dominance over the Trojans, running for more than 115 yards for the third time in as many games against the Trojans. He has also scored four touchdowns in those three games. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
It turned out to be anything but that.
The Trojans (7-4, 4-4) fell behind from the start and never caught up, falling victim to the up-and-down Beavers (5-5, 4-3) 36-7 on a bone-chilling night in Corvallis, Ore.
“I am very disappointed and really shocked by the outcome of this game,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
Several Trojans players attributed the loss to an unfocused week at practice.
“It just goes back to practice like coach Kiff said,” redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Matt Kalil said. “It was our worst Tuesday, our worst Wednesday practice and it showed.”
Although Oregon State tailback Jacquizz Rodgers — who finished with 128 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries — gave the USC defense trouble, the loss came as a result of the Trojan offense’s inability to produce results: USC’s ground game was continually stuffed by the Oregon State defensive line, and its pass attack seemed to be non-existent under the watch of the Beaver secondary. No Trojan rusher gained more than 57 yards, and USC was held to just 135 yards through the air.
“We did not play well as an offense at all; not nearly close to how we needed to play to win,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said. “It just wasn’t a good day for us.”
USC showed some fight at the start of the contest, but the Trojans simply could not respond to Oregon State’s challenges. USC surrendered a sole field goal in the first quarter, but the three-point differential quickly expanded in the second — the Beavers returned an interception for a 65-yard touchdown, then converted a touchdown and a field goal on their next two offensive possessions to take a 20-0 lead into the half.
Although the Trojans entered the third quarter led by senior backup quarterback Mitch Mustain, they managed to not only find the scoreboard for the first time but to also outscore Oregon State in the quarter. After a Beavers’ field goal, USC senior tailback C.J. Gable found the end zone on a 13-yard run to cap a seven-play, three-minute Trojan drive.
Unfortunately for USC, these were all the points it would manage for the night, as a couple of late touchdowns by Oregon State in the fourth ran the final score up to 36-7.
Senior fullback Stanley Havili said he felt the game simply came down to the Trojans being outperformed.
“We have to execute,” Havili said. “When you kill yourselves on drives, there’s nothing you can do.”
To make matters worse, injuries ravaged the already-depleted USC roster. Barkley left the game after being sacked with just four seconds left in the first half, and sat out the rest of the contest with a high-ankle sprain. He was just 10-of-19 with 75 yards and an interception at the half. Redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler, who had 34 rushing yards on 11 carries, injured his ankle in the third quarter, re-aggravating a previous injury. Redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo left the game in the first quarter with a concussion and reported experiencing a loss of vision and nausea shortly afterward.
“We got banged up throughout the game,” Kiffin said. “Hopefully we get all those guys back and get to work.”
Saturday’s game marked the first time in nine seasons the Trojans were held scoreless in the first half; their seven-point total was the lowest for USC since its 10-6 loss to Utah in 2001.
But despite the poor performance, Kiffin said the game on Saturday wasn’t a season-defining loss for the Trojans.
“We don’t overreact to one game either way,” he said. “One game doesn’t define you. Last week we weren’t the greatest team with no problems. This week we weren’t the worst team with a million problems. But if you put together a couple games when you play like that, it becomes who you are. So obviously it will be our goal not to do that, and we’ll go back home and have the chance to play in [Los Angeles] two weeks in a row.”
An embarrassing loss is what you get when you do not tke your opponent seriously.
Now for Notre Dame and UCLA, SC will be out played nd out coached unless everyone steps it up.  Both ND and UCLA are out for blood this season as they must win in order to get to a bowl game.
So, Trojans?  What’s it gonna be?
Fight on!
Beat the Domers.
At least our basketball team is making some strides. SC’s not a 1-trick pony you know. But for the Irish and Bruins, we better step it up. We can’t go out like that.

The USC women’s basketball team used a balanced scoring effort to take down Long Beach State 82-60 on Sunday at the Galen Center.
Nine 3-pointers in the second half didn’t hurt, either.
The Women of Troy bullied an undersized 49ers team down low in the first half, then got hot from outside to secure their second win of the season. Four players scored in double figures for USC, led by freshman forward Cassie Harberts and senior guard Jacki Gemelos with 14 points apiece. Junior guard Ashley Corral (13) and sophomore forward Christina Marinacci (11) rounded out the scoring for the Women of Troy.
“That’s one of the things that we’re stressing in our offense,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “When you share the basketball everyone’s having fun and working hard for one another. This was a good game for us to bounce back from Duke.”
As a team, the Women of Troy finished with a season-high 20 assists.
USC didn’t play its best basketball in the first half but staked a 16-point halftime lead by dominating its own backboard. The Women of Troy grabbed 12 of the 23 shots they missed in the half and converted those offensive rebounds into 11 second-chance points.
“We started a big lineup because we wanted to rebound well,” Cooper said. “We got beat up pretty bad at Duke but we learned our lesson and understand we have to do our work when the ball is in the air.”
The Women of Troy jumped out to an 8-0 lead minutes into the game before turnovers and missed layups allowed Long Beach State to crawl back in to the game. After 49ers guard Jazmyne Porter banked in a 3-pointer from the top of the key, the score stood at 10-9. From there, USC closed the half on a 26-11 run to take a 36-20 lead into the locker room.
In the second half, the Women of Troy did most of their damage from the outside. USC knocked down seven of its first nine 3-pointers in the second half and stretched the lead to as many as 32 points before a late run by Long Beach State.
“Sometimes you get a little complacent when you have a big lead,” Cooper said. “We have to understand that you can’t afford to do that.”
Gemelos started the game slowly but knocked down 5-of-6 shots after the break to pace her team in scoring.
“I came out in the second half with the mentality to keep shooting the ball,” Gemelos said.
Her biggest contributions came when she wasn’t shooting the ball. Gemelos handed out six assists in the game, several of the spectacular variety. In the first half, she found junior guard Briana Gilbreath under the basket with a no-look pass. Later in the game Gemelos threaded an up-and-under pass through traffic to a streaking Harberts.
It’s really nice playing with her because I like to cut backdoor,” Harberts said. “Ashley and Jacki are both great passers.”
Harberts also chipped in eight rebounds — five offensive — for USC.
One of the only negatives for the Women of Troy was the play of 49ers freshman guard Brandi Henton, who scored 23 of her 30 points after halftime. Still, Cooper didn’t seem overly concerned with his team’s defensive play.
“She got loose a lot but we did a good job overall,” he said. “She scored 30 but nobody else got more than eight. One player is not going to beat us by scoring 40 or 50.”
Next up for the Women of Troy is a home date Tuesday against Georgia.
“It’s going to be similar to the Duke game,” Gemelos said. “Big, strong girls that we’re going to need to be tough against.”

It takes a real cupcake lover to stand in the rain on a cold morning in Hollywood, waiting for a chance to taste the confections of some of the most passionate cupcake bakers in Los Angeles. At the Cupcake Camp L.A. event, produced by BakeSpace.com founder Babette Pepaj, cupcake connoisseurs and amateurs alike indulged their sweet tooth with a cupcake tasting event that benefited three worthy charities.
The event was comprised of two two-hour long cupcake tastings: one from noon to 2 p.m. and a second tasting from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Entrance fees paid for five tasting tickets, allowing attendees to choose five cupcakes of their liking to sample. Some booths had miniature cupcakes, but most had full-sized treats.
The only problem was choosing from the hundreds of different flavors offered, as the scene inside Hollywood’s Music Box Theater on Saturday was a dream come true for any cupcake fan. Tables and booths were overflowing with the sweet treats. Cupcakes large and small, ranging in flavors from the classic chocolate and vanilla to red velvet and pumpkin, filled the room. Some were topped with fruit, while others were covered in glitter.
Some bakers debuted new and unusual flavors at the charitably sweet event. The most intriguing among them was Jackie Brubaker’s Jack and Coke cupcake, with Coca-Cola-flavored cake and Jack Daniels whiskey frosting.
Where does one get the inspiration to model a cupcake after an alcoholic beverage?
“I just really love Jack and Cokes,” she said.
Apparently, her ingenuity paid off, as she was the first of the day to run out of cupcakes at the tasting.
Brandy Simon, owner of Parties and Cupcakes event planning service, got inspiration for her cupcakes for the event from something a little less 21-and-over: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
She debuted her Harry Potter-themed cupcakes, affectionately named “Fawkes’ Phoenix Rising Beignet Cupcakes” and “Hagrid’s Pumpkin and Chocolate Cauldron Cakes,” the same weekend the first part of the final movie opened in theaters.
Others used recipes passed down from generations, like Sheryl Mueller, who used her grandmother’s recipe for her “chocolate surprise” cupcakes.
“I’ve been baking since I was a kid,” she said.
Besides following in her grandmother’s culinary footsteps, Mueller also displayed a cupcake concoction of her own — a surprisingly delicious root beer float cupcake. Rather than putting the root beer in the frosting, she added it to the cake portion to give it a stronger flavor. Like most of the bakers, Mueller baked more than 250 cupcakes for the event.
All in all, 56 bakers were in attendance, all with their own original flavors and flair. Some went for chic simplicity, while others went all out, like the ladies of Sweets ‘N Treats, a cake and candy supply company.
The theme of their cupcake booth was “Happy Hour,” and they displayed cupcakes inspired by classic fruity drinks — lime margaritas, appletinis and strawberry daiquiris. Not only were the flavors imaginative, but the cupcakes themselves were decorated true to the theme, complete with little pink straws and cocktail umbrellas sticking out of the frosting.
For most of the bakers it was their first time participating in a Cupcake Camp event. But for many of them, it won’t be their last, either.
“We’re loving every minute of it,” the workers at Sweet ‘N Treats said in unison.
Although the favorite flavors of the day are subject to debate, it is obvious that the seven months of planning and preparation that host Pepaj put into the event paid off. It was Pepaj’s first time hosting a Cupcake Camp event, and she said that the day ran smoothly and everyone enjoyed the event.
Besides cupcakes, the event also had three photo booths, which uploaded pictures directly to Facebook and MySpace, as well as face painting for kids, a DJ and cupcakes for attendees to decorate themselves on the stage of the theater. Attendees were also able to vote for their favorite-tasting cupcake, and the “most L.A.” cupcake of the day, with the winning bakers receiving trophies as prizes.
Proceeds from the event went to three charities: Angel Acres Horse Rescue, InvisiblePeople.tv and American Tortoise Rescue. Pepaj’s goal was to raise $15,000, but the actual outcome is not yet known. With a line all the way down the block of hungry cupcake fans, it seems likely that the goal was met or exceeded.
Regardless of the actual numbers, it was a sweet day for cupcake fans and charities alike.
I live in San Francisco and ordered from Sweets N Treats an amazing array of cakes, cupcakes, cookies and candies for Halloween. Yvette Gonzales (the owner) shipped everything to me Federal Express.  Her carrot cake with cream cheese frosting was AMAZING!  The best carrot cake I’ve ever eaten…luscious, moist, great texture and the frosting…yummy! We had a whole array of cupcakes decorated with Halloween decorations and for the World Series winner, the SF Giants.  My dessert table was a smashing success!  Thank you Sweets N Treats!

Only a few films can mix comedy and drama in a period piece, but Made in Dagenham is a rare gem that does exactly that.
Equality · Dagenham follows the true story of the 1968 strike. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics 
Made in Dagenham tells the true story of the women working in the Ford Motor Co. in 1968 who go on strike, demanding pay equal to men. Directed by Nigel Cole (Calendar Girls), the film is an inspiring tale of women who stayed true to their belief in equal rights, despite the many hurdles they had to overcome.
This British film smoothly combines humor with drama, making its audiences laugh and cry all within two hours.
The film follows 187 factory women who sew car seat upholstery. They work under horrid conditions with a leaky roof and stifling heat in the summer, and despite their skilled labor, are only paid a fraction of the men’s pay.
Their sympathetic union representative, Albert (Bob Hoskins), encourages the women to bring their grievances to Ford management, by arranging a meeting to speak with the higher ups. At the meeting Rita O’Grady (Sally Hawkins) — outraged by the lack of respect the men show her — demands that the women be given pay on par with the male workers.
With the encouragement from Albert and Connie (Geraldine James), the factory workers’ matriarch of sorts, Rita soon leads the women on strike. The company at first finds it amusing but quickly worries about the strike and its impact on the factory.
The men working in the factories, including Rita’s husband Eddie (Daniel Mays), start to resent the women on strike the entire Dagenham facility is put on temporary closure after the plant runs out of furnished seat upholstery.
However, Rita’s fight for equality begins to generate headlines around the country and the women get the attention of Barbara Castle (Miranda Richardson), the secretary of state for employment and productivity.
Castle is smart, blunt and forceful, adding a level of excitement to the film. This spark of energy makes for several comedic scenes, and Richardson does a superb job in bringing her feisty character to life.
The film brings together an impressive and noteworthy cast that delivers a great performance. Hoskins plays a key role in the film providing emotional and humorous moments, giving the movie a sympathetic male viewpoint. His facial reactions and one-liners keep the audience laughing.
Hoskin’s scenes with Hawkins are some of the strongest in the film, adding a greater level of depth to both characters.
But it’s the lead actress that steals the show. Hawkins deserves special recognition for her wonderful performance as Rita.
In essence, the role is similar to Sally Field’s title role in the 1979 film Norma Rae, but Hawkins delivers a unique, standout performance.
Rita is an identifiable character — she is a young working mother who struggles with balancing her work and her home life. She does not consider herself a leader but her great passion for equality pushes her forward to do wonderful things — it’s a classic case of an unsure person rising to the role of a hero.
This exceptionally entertaining film captures the timeless struggle of woman’s fight for equality. It pays tribute to women who have struggled and fought to be treated as equals.
The film never comes across as preachy or too much of a history lesson, because the audience is so entranced by the performances the women give in the film. The historical context is treated appropriately, not forced down the audience’s throat.
It is truly an inspiring film of an ordinary woman who achieves something extraordinary. It is a touching film that salutes women for pushing boundaries and leaves audiences with a sense of joy and hopefulness of the future.

It’s that time of year: the calm before the storm.
Thanksgiving is fast approaching, but less than a week from the annual rite of turkey feasting, you get overwhelmed by a mad flurry of exams, research papers and all-nighter induced Red Bull binges. Right after the semester ends and you think relief is in sight, the stress of holidays hits you.
At frantic times like this, it is important to take a step back and breathe. Pour yourself a glass of wine (or cranberry juice) and treat yourself right by gifting yourself these nine treats during the holiday season.
1. Bathe in chocolate
Food can be a great temporary stress-reliever, but let’s face it — it’s also why obesity is so prevalent. For guiltless satisfaction without the calories, find bath products that smell like your favorite treats.
With fragrances like Ginger Snap, Perfect Pumpkin, and the brownie-flavored The Devil Made Me Do It, KleanSpa in Burbank, Calif., sells all kinds of bath products that will pamper your foodie senses while keeping you clean, scrubbed and moisturized in preparation for exams.
2. Stock up your pantry
Never has your grocery store been so cheap. Supermarkets are competing with each other to attract the most customers, and prices are dipping lower than ever.
Here are some basement-priced staples to load up on: turkey (get two: one for Thanksgiving and freeze the other), nuts and seeds (for snacking, baking and brittles), flour, crackers and butter (for everything).
3. Try Crazy Festive Cupcakes
Cupcakes might be so 2000s, but before you leave for the holidays, take home a box of Yummy Cupcakes’ seasonal cupcakes, such as its turkey gravy cupcake with cranberry relish cream cheese frosting.
For a less ambitious offering, try their Candy Cane cupcake with peppermint buttercream and mini candy cane. Or the Spiked Eggnog with brandy eggnog buttercream. Or the Marshmallow Yam.
You get the point. Festive flavors go cupcake-crazy at Yummy Cupcakes, and you don’t want to miss it.
4. Grab Jammies Jams’ Turkey Bacon Jam
Jammies Jams’ turkey bacon jam (www.jammiesjams.com) is another Angeleno souvenir you should be sure to snag. Jam isn’t just for bread and butter, especially when you’ve got such a wonderful, spreadable blend of sweet apple butter and turkey bacon, pecan, bourbon, pimento and spices.
Heat and melt the jam, slather it onto your favorite holiday bird (or even ham) and let the meat roast in the sweet, sticky glaze. If turkey in turkey jam sounds too odd for you, you can also baste thick bacon slices with the condiment to make candied bacon.
Or what about savory thumbprint jam cookies for holiday gifts?
5. Call Foodie 911
Not everyone is born a chef. We can’t all whip out feather-light pavlovas or roll out impromptu gnocchi from leftover mashed potatoes. Most of us just want to eat good food.
But the holidays might require you to play the chef. When you’re up to your elbows cooking for a dinner party that will arrive in an hour, you don’t want to be guessing or making up a last-minute dish when something stumps you in the kitchen.

6. Volunteer at the Soup Kitchen
’Tis the season to be merry and unselfish. After all the love, hugs and gifts you’ll be receiving, it will do the universe good to give a little back.
Search for volunteer opportunities at DoSomething.org’s volunteer database or drop by your community’s soup kitchens to find out what they need. Even if the volunteer list is full, there are always opportunities to share some love, so keep your eyes — and heart —open.
7. Shop at Artisanal L.A.
If you missed the first Artisanal L.A. in October, mark down Dec. 11 and 12 for this holiday edition pop-up shop selling all things local.
Not only will you be able to sample and buy all sorts of delicious, creative products made by hand, your holiday gifts would also showcase the talents and pride of Angelenos who sold you their artwork in person.
8. Visit The Grove
The Grove is dangerous, especially during the holidays. When the lights are strung, the fountain gleaming with colorful reflections and everyone around you is lugging holiday-themed shopping bags, you just cannot resist the urge to spend.
Even if you promise to just window-shop, there are lots of things to see, most notably the recently opened Wonderland Bakery, which looks like a fairy-tale house brought to life with its sweet pastel colors and candy decorations.
Lust over its fancy, adorable cupcakes and cookies from a safe distance, but blame it on magic if you come out with a pair of gingerbread men.
9. Go Korean
Ever since the success of Korean taco truck Kogi gained national fame, Korean food is becoming more and more popular. Technomic, a Chicago-based market research firm, has even predicted Korean cuisine to be a 2011 food trend.
Get a head start on the trend by taking advantage of Los Angeles’ Koreatown. Beside the usual Korean tacos and BBQ, try Korean fried chicken, blood sausages, rice cakes, noodles, stews and casseroles.
The holidays are a time to eat well and be happy. Whatever you choose, enjoy it.

Fans, relax — it’s not the end of Harry Potter yet.
The seventh and final installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, directed by David Yates, was released on Friday — but only the first part of it.
Whether financially or creatively motivated, the decision to split the final book of J.K. Rowling’s famous wizarding tales into two parts was a wise one. After all the dramatic buildup to this final climax, it would only be an injustice to the books and fans to rush through the finale to this series, especially when it wields the darkest and most complex moments throughout the history of Harry Potter.

Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is not a happy movie.
Gone are the charming wonders of the magical world, along with its curious and delightful chocolate frogs and Bertie Bott’s beans. Gone is the excited gaggle of students gossiping within the warm castle walls of Hogwarts, the beloved school of witchcraft and wizardry. And gone is the reassuring, safe presence of headmaster Albus Dumbledore.
Instead, a dark, moody tone shrouds the entire atmosphere. Even the numerous landscape scenes, though vast and beautiful, are shot under a gloomy, overcast sky that seems to swallow the small figures of the characters.
In fact, the film’s plot centers on the juxtaposition of three bewildered teenagers — Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) — in a big, scary world that crushes them with the responsibility of defeating the evil, power-hungry Voldemort.
The story picks up right where it left off in Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince (2009): Voldemort is back, and his plans have never been more evil. And of course, Harry tries to save the day.
The only way he can do that is by tracking and destroying all of Voldemort’s seven Horcruxes — the random objects in which Voldemort preserved part of his soul to ensure eternal life. The problem is that Harry doesn’t have a clue what those Horcruxes are, where to find them or how to destroy them.
Talk about mission impossible.
Meanwhile, Voldemort has dispatched his minions, the Death Eaters, to hunt Harry down so that he can finish Harry off himself — including anybody who dares to help him.
That leaves Harry twisted by guilt, which is just one of the many conflicted emotions anchoring him as he embarks on his mission. Day by day, he struggles with mounting fear, loss, confusion and frustration, and — worst of all — moments of doubt and disillusionment toward Dumbledore, the figure he once so admired and loved.
The storyline and production setting takes on a stronger political motif and makes allusions to George Orwell’s 1984 and the Nazis by further revealing government corruption and unethical media practices. Wizards and witches are dragged down to be interrogated about the purity of their magic blood and their loyalty to Voldemort.
Despite all the maiming and murders, the story plods at a much slower pace than the previous movies. This detailed narrative might seem tedious to an audience who wants constant excitement, but fans who have always been more interested in the stories behind the characters will relish seeing some issues being addressed that otherwise have only been hinted slightly on other films; namely, the sensitive relationship between Hermione, Harry and Ron.
What makes this film so different from the previous ones is that these three characters are finally given the chance to shine. Ever since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001), the young actors playing the leads have always been overshadowed by the colorful performances of their supporting actors, who are mostly well-known and accomplished British thespians.
But these lead actors have grown up. After almost a decade of working with an experienced acting crew, they are now ready to hold their own stage — and they nail it.
The awkward, comical antics, the fits of high school jealousy and resentments, the flashes of sweet budding romance are played out skillfully and seamlessly by these young actors. And thus they manage to successfully capture the audience’s heart and attention in their characters’ personal development.
As a package, this film lacks a lot of details and explanations as compared to the book. Avid fans will notice that there are a few scenes missing, but within the 146 minutes of screen time, the director uses each minute well, paying sensitive attention to even the minor scenes, and leaving no clutter behind.
With haunting, thrilling visuals, foreboding symbols and endearing character developments, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 sets an appropriate preparation for a stunning finale,.Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait until July for that.

Education and healthcare should top the list of priorities for governor-elect Jerry Brown, according to the latest Los Angeles Times/USC poll.
Laurel Van Patten  | Daily Trojan
Fifty-two percent of Asian voters and 51 percent of Latino voters said protecting healthcare and education should be Brown’s top priority.
Overall, 42 percent of 2010 midterm voters agreed.
Healthcare and education were closely followed by cutting state spending, which was a top policy concern for 33 percent of voters.
“The results are consistent,”said Darry Sragow, interim director of the LAT/USC poll and adjunct assistant professor of political science at USC. “Voters absolutely want to protect certain programs — notably healthcare and education for certain groups — but they have absolutely no interest in raising taxes.”
Despite wanting to cut state spending, an overwhelming majority of voters did not support cutting funds from California K-12 schools. Seventy percent did not support cuts in education and 33 percent thought that spending for K-12 schools should be increased.
Forty-two percent of the state’s general fund goes to education, however, so cutting spending without cutting education is a near impossibility, Sragow said.
“There’s a dilemma when it comes to fixing our current balance,” Sragow said. “We want to protect education and healthcare for kids and for seniors and the disabled and people that need that help. On the other hand, it is a near tiny fraction for those that just want to increase taxes.”
Although very few California voters favored tax increases alone to curb the budget deficit, they were evenly split between spending cuts or a combination of spending cuts and tax increases to ease the state’s economic woes. Forty-four percent favored spending cuts alone, another 44 percent favored a combination of cuts and tax increases, and only 6 percent favored tax increases alone.
Overall, voters also supported granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children and have since graduated from a U.S. high school or served in the military for at least two years, legislation which mirrors that of the DREAM Act.
“[Latinos] are more supportive, but whites support the DREAM Act 75 to 22 [percent],” said Manuel Pastor, professor of American studies and ethnicity. “There’s widespread support.”
Dan Ichinose, director of the Demographic Research Project at the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, said Asian-American voters typically felt the same.
“The story for Asian-Americans was that Asian-Americans, along with Latinos, rejected a trend toward conservatism,” Ichinose said. “Asian-Americans in this poll were more likely to think themselves Democrats versus Republican. In a state that’s disproportionately immigrant, it’s likely that anti-immigrant policies turned voters against conservatism.”
When it came to healthcare, a majority of midterm election voters were in favor of retaining or increasing spending on healthcare for children and low-to-moderate income families. Overall, 67 percent of voters opposed a cut to healthcare spending, while 37 supported cutting healthcare spending “a lot” or “a little” to reduce the budget deficit.
The poll also asked about Californians’ thoughts on transportation and prison spending. A majority of voters favored spending cuts for state prisons, but they were split on whether the state’s transportation, roads and rail systems should receive more or less funding. Forty-nine percent thought funding should decrease, while 45 percent favored retaining or increasing transportation spending.
Sragow said Brown has a lot of room to maneuver in the coming months.
“Expectations for Jerry are actually quite modest,” Sragow said. “Forty-five percent thought it was only important for little progress to be made in [the top areas of concern among voters.]
The LAT/USC poll was conducted from Nov. 3 to Nov. 14. It surveyed 1,689 registered voters in California and 1,457 people who voted in the 2010 midterm election.
Reading this article reminds me of why I live in Virginia now.  Does it feel as if 44% of the budget goes to education?  Certainly not, so clearly there is a lot of waste in the system.  If California wants to solve its budget woes, then it needs to get serious about the root cause of the problem.
Someday California will wake up when all the jobs and businesses move to states such as Texas and Virginia.  Let’s hope it’s not too late.
Oregon is considering a single-payer universal health care system for their State.  California should do the same, now that Congress has dropped the ball.

Two former USC football icons reunited today in one of the biggest venues football has to offer, as the Seattle Seahawks’ first-year coach Pete Carroll headed to the New Orleans Superdome to take on the Saints and their star running back Reggie Bush.
Though both Carroll and Bush’s reputations have been tarnished at USC — Bush for the sanctions caused by his acceptance of money and gifts as a student-athlete and Carroll for leaving the team in the midst of such controversy and turmoil — neither the coah nor his former player have any hard feelings toward each other regarding their contraversial past.
“Not at all, because what we built while we were there together, we built a relationship, a brotherhood so to speak,” Bush said earlier this week before the two teams matched up.  “Coach Carroll is a guy I’ll always have the highest regard for and love and respect . . . No matter what happened at the end of the day, nobody can take anything away from us.”
Bush has not let his shaky history with his alma mater get in the way of his performance in the NFL, as he has quickly become a fan favorite in New Orleans and managed to raise the Lombardi trophy over his head in just his fourth season in the league.
“The things that they’re doing with him are the things we tried to do with him in college.  You try to get him in space.  You try to get him in matchups.  You try to utilize his great speed and ability to bust plays and games wide open,” Carroll said of his former player in a conference call. “They totally understand it.”
Bush did admit he wanted nothing more than to beat Carroll and his new team — and though he did not play in today’s game, he got his wish. The Saints defeated the Seahawks, 34-19.

A recent study conducted by Project Information Literacy, an ongoing research project based in the University of Washington, suggests that college students in the digital age are facing new problems conducting research.
The study surveyed 8,353 students from 25 college campuses across the United States and found that in an era when vast amounts of information is easily accessible, students struggle sorting through everything and making sense of their research.
According to the study, 84 percent of students said that the most difficult part of the research process was simply getting started. Sixty-six percent struggled defining a topic, and 61 percent said they frequently had difficulty filtering through irrelevant results once they began their research.
Alison Head, who co-wrote the report along with Michael Eisenberg, said the study focused on revealing the truth behind the difficulties students face in conducting research.
“Our research was different because we really wanted to find out from the students’ perspective what it’s like to be a student today and do research in a college setting,” Head said. “What we were trying to do is tell the students’ story, get away from standards and tell what it’s like to be a student today on a college campus.”
When students have access to thousands of sources at their fingertips, the study suggested that this proliferation of information is precisely what causes problems for students. With so many sources available, simply navigating the information becomes overwhelming.
Robert Labaree, the head of the Von Kleinsmid Center Library, agreed that research skills have changed dramatically with the growth of technologies such as the internet.
“The original conceptualization of the digital divide was that you had people who didn’t have access to computers or the Internet,” Labaree said. “Nowadays, it’s more of a divide between those who are skilled in locating the right type of information and those who struggle to understand how to search it effectively.”
According to the study, students often turn to online search engines such as Google to start their research, but Labaree and Head said that such techniques can often overwhelm students because of the amount of information that is returned by a search.
“Search engines are the most difficult part of doing research,” said Matthew Redhead, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “It’s such a pain looking for information you need that is stuck in the [complicated] mess that is the Internet.”
Resources are available through the university to assist students in conducting research. Labaree said some of the most helpful and underutilized resources for students are the librarians.
“We’re here for the purpose of helping facilitate the research and the learning of students here on campus,” Labaree said. “We can make their lives so much easier if they just ask for help.”
However, he acknowledged that libraries still have work to do in order to adapt to the changing information landscape and continue to help students.
One suggestion Labaree made is that libraries need to extend their technological presence and take advantage of things such as smartphone applications, to be more accessible to students. Labaree said that there are still several basic fundamentals that libraries can improve upon in catering to students’ needs at USC but that some obstacles stand in the way.
“The ratio of the number of library faculty here and the number of students at USC is not on par with similar research universities,” Labaree said. “The faculty that are here do a great job, but when you see peer institutions that have twice as many, you become concerned about who you’re not reaching.”
Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC libraries, said there is still progress being made by USC libraries despite some struggles faced by students and staff.
“We’re trying to reverse the trend of students not going to librarians as a resource,” McHarg said. “In 2009, we re-established the reference desk in Doheny and staffed it with librarians. For the fall semester last year, the number of students going to ask for research help increased by 68 percent.”
“Those numbers suggest that USC students are finding those resources,” he said.
[…] recent study by the UW’s Project Information Legacy suggests there is just too much information out there and that students are having a tough time doing research in the digital […]

Trojan Vision, USC’s student-run television station, is now broadcasting in high definition on channel 8.1, though students with older television sets will not be able to see the new format.
The updates in USC’s broadcasting reflect Trojan Vision’s goal to remain at the forefront of technological advances on campus, said Karthik Ravishankar, Trojan Vision distribution and news media manager.
Picture perfect - Cassie Bussing, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts and the executive producer for Trojan Vision’s show The Cutting Edge, works at the student-run station. Trojan Vision will now broadcast in a new high-definition format on channel 8.1. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
“High definition is clearly the direction broadcasting is going in, and as a college TV station, we want to keep up with the times,” said Ravishankar, a senior majoring in business administration and economics.
Trojan Vision viewers will also have to keep up with the times. The television station will now only be accessible from high-definition TVs.
Students with digital, HD TVs will need to reprogram their setup and rescan for channels on their TVs to be able to watch, which Ravishankar said is an easy process.
Though students will be unable to access Trojan Vision from outdated televisions, Olivia Bonin, the station’s promotions manager, said the majority of viewers watch online at Trojanvision.com.
“Recently, there have been more viewers per day, and they’re watching for longer periods of time,” Bonin said.
Bonin estimates the online traffic to be approximately 1,000 viewers daily.
Trojan Vision attracts a range of non-USC viewers, mostly because of the popularity of its talk show CU@USC, Bonin said. Weird Al Yankovic and Chris Colfer, from the show Glee, have been among featured guests.
Still, the aim of Trojan Vision is to target USC students.
“We want Trojan Vision to be the center of USC and to reflect the interests of everyone on campus,” Bonin said.
Ellen Kaster, a freshman majoring in public relations, said she watches the show Platforum online to learn what people are talking about and to hear varying student perspectives.
Kaster said she preferred to watch Trojan Vision online before it was in HD.
“The quality of online broadcasts is sharp. It’s great to see that quality in the television broadcasts with the new station,” Kaster said.
Before the television station’s update to high definition the team had to downgrade the quality of their footage for the old television station.
“Now when we get great footage at the red carpets, we can shoot in HD and actually air in HD,” Bonin said.

Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and UC San Francisco have found that Alzheimer’s strongly affects Latino Americans, who tend to get the condition almost seven years earlier than white Americans.
The Alzheimer’s Association told the Los Angeles Times that the situation is “a looming but unrecognized public health crisis.”
The association predicted that Alzheimer’s and related dementias could afflict 1.3 million older Latinos by 2050, a 200,000 increase from those currently affected.
Additionally, other experts also told the Times that limited access to medical care and health insurance, lower levels of education and income and higher rates of high blood pressure and diabetes contribute to the above-average risks of Latinos with Alzheimer’s.
Researchers said treating Alzheimer’s is also very difficult since cognitive lapses of treatable medical issues, including depression, thyroid problems and the side effects of medication can occur, according to Freddy Ortiz, coordinator of the memory disorders clinic at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center.
Although research has shown that medication cannot reverse Alzheimer’s, services such as adult daycare and drugs that offer short-term relief of symptoms can help those dealing with Alzheimer’s.

We shop at a supermarket, staring at a row of ketchup bottles. After contemplating for several seconds, we instinctively choose Heinz. We go to the mall, facing a plethora of stores. After considering whether today will finally be the day where we visit “that one store we’ve never set foot in,” we turn our backs and head into the familiar Forever 21, H&M or Urban Outfitters.
On the surface, we justify our choice of these ubiquitous brands because they’re popular, cool or of better quality. But researchers are attributing this to a much more complex phenomenon — brand attachment.
A study from USC’s Marshall School of Business examined the characteristics necessary for brand attachment and the consequences of not satisfying consumers with their favored brands. The researchers defined brand attachment as “the strength of the bond connecting the brand with the self.”
Maybe it’s OK to prefer the stylish exterior of the MacBook Pro to the average PC laptop, or the USC sweater to a generic Target hoodie.
I, too, have become a victim of this so-called brand attachment — adorning my dorm room with all things Hello Kitty and USC, using Herbal Essences for my shampoo and, like many others, owning an iPod rather than one of the many alternative mp3 players on the market.
One aspect of the study sparks a reality check: that brand attachment is similar to personal relationships.
Researcher Deborah MacInnis told the Daily Trojan that people’s relationships with their counterparts, either happy or sad, is no different than their relationships with brands.
Therefore, should we assume that for the masses the loss of a loved one is equivalent to the loss of a Blackberry?
For most, the general response would be “That’s ridiculous.” But the results of the study, which show that brand attachment is higher than we believe it to be, nevertheless, make us reconsider our own consumer habits.
Do we truly love that particular Starbucks or Jamba Juice drink over The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf or Robeks, or do we just love toting around those cups with those logos on them? What would happen if we were in a place where there were no Starbucks within a 100-mile radius?
The study said that some will suffer the level of emotional distress found in the loss of a family member or friend. As consumers, we should not fall into this trap of likening our love for brands to our love of people.
The study also concluded that because of brand attachment, people will go above and beyond to obtain their desired products and will more likely overlook their negative qualities.
Despite a large amount of complaints regarding the iPhone 4’s reception, those who buy it forgive its problems easily, most likely because of its price tag and Apple logo. Although BMW recently recalled 150,000 vehicles because of technical issues, this doesn’t stop those who love their beamers.
Just as we shouldn’t allow ourselves to fall into a situation where brands could cause us distress, we shouldn’t simply overlook major issues that plague the  logos and names we love — maybe there really is something wrong with it, something that will cost us hassle in the future.
Instead of always reaching for favorite brands, consumers should explore other options; it is likely that they could find a brand isn’t all that it’s made out to be. There are other choices out there.
By exploring options not typically considered, brand attachments would lessen and buyers would experience overall higher satisfaction from the lack of stress experienced when their favored option is unavailable. If all else fails, it is OK to go back to Subway after eating at Quiznos.
Though reasons for why people form brand attachments are still unclear, consumers should act now to combat conclusions made from this study.
Next time at the supermarket, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to reach for a less expensive ketchup.

Damn you, Aaron Sorkin. Sure, you gave us perhaps the best one-hour television drama of the last 15 years, and for that we’ll forgive you for causing every script since then to be about 50 pages longer than anyone should be forced to sit in a dark room staring at a screen.

But then you went and made a movie that somehow convinced people older than 35 that they finally understand our generation.
Despite The Social Network’s many successes — among them, somehow making the act of typing cinematically engaging — the movie has convinced a horde of baby boomers that Generation Y defines itself by social media and technology.
Actually, we define ourselves by watermarks of the ’90s. Goosebumps. Wishbone. Floral stirrup pants. Every 20-something walking around out there is a product of the last of the good PBS programming and high-rise jeans.
And Bill Nye. The avuncular idol of our childhood visited campus on Wednesday, prompting lines the size of which haven’t been seen since President Barack Obama’s visit in October (Though, of course, Nye’s crowd skewed younger.)
But when Nye fainted onstage halfway through his talk, USC students came under instant fire in the blogosphere for ignoring the collapsed man onstage and instead reaching for cell phones to post updates on Twitter and Facebook.
Yahoo! News ran a brief on the incident under the pithy headline “If the Science Guy passes out and nobody tweets it, did it even happen?,” which described the audience’s “nonreaction.”
“It appears that the students in attendance, rather than getting up from their seats to rush to Nye’s aid, instead pulled out their mobile devices to post information about Nye’s loss of consciousness,” the article said.
Indignant commenters across the United States hurried online to mix metaphors and hyperbolize the situation. “Embarassed” commented on the Daily Trojan website, “I am embarrassed and horrified at our younger generation. What is wrong with you people. To [sic] busy to help out a fellow human being? He could have died while all of you were sitting there tweeting or taking pictures. You should all be expelled!!”
The Science Guy himself gamely awakened a few seconds after falling, and stood up woozily to continue his lecture. Some students said they had been confused when Nye fell, wondering if it was part of the famously buoyant speaker’s act.
But it was in the 10 seconds that Nye lay prone on the floor that USC students — and by extension, all college students — damned themselves in the eyes of the nation, which apparently expected the crowd to storm the stage en masse and administer collective CPR.
As much as bloggers might hope otherwise, this incident was not an example of a generational detachment from reality and empathy; it was merely a case of confusion in a crowded auditorium. Should students have been expected to take Nye’s recovery into their own hands when members of Program Board were already at his side and trained professionals were on their way?
Those quick to assign 2.0 blame by proxy to the student body should perhaps disconnect from the medium themselves; the Daily Trojan received not a single complaint via snail mail.
It’s easy to put our generation in the driver’s seat of the handbasket, destination: Hell. But that’s too simple a conclusion.
As for tonight’s speaker: Fear not, Joseph Gordon Levitt. Should you lose your footing at any point during your speech, you can be sure of at least one person sprinting to your aid, leaping balletically over Bovard personnel and Department of Public Safety officers to tend to you.
I’ll tweet about it later.

There’s no question that Apple revolutionized the way we listen to music.
The music industry in particular has undergone significant changes because of digital music sales through the iTunes Music Store. Apple’s empire began with the perfect marriage of iTunes and iPod, a pairing that is now considered the current standard of the listening public for purchase of digital music. Virtually all musical acts thrive on spreading their music through iTunes in order to utilize the far reaching arm of the “Apple Empire” to reach their audience.
Despite iTunes’ massive influence over the music industry in the last decade, until recently, one musical act has maintained its separation from the musical giant and has been able to see steady sales for more than 50 years.
Last week, Apple announced that music from The Beatles will now be available on iTunes. Since the announcement, sales have skyrocketed — The Beatles have 55 songs on the list of Top 200 songs as well as a number of albums on the Top 200
albums.
But that’s not really much of a surprise. The Beatles catalogue is one of the most important pieces of musical property in history and has had strong sales throughout its entire existence — sales that easily transitioned over to iTunes.

“In a community, for a community” is a special supplemental section of the Daily Trojan, focusing on the ties the University of Southern California has to its surrounding community.
Though the nature of the bond between the school and the neighborhood in which it is situated has changed with the times, an analysis of past, present and future events reveals one thing: there will always be a relationship.
—
Looking forward by looking back: You can’t blame USC for looking forward. Our university is still rising in stature at a breakneck pace.
Baptism by fire: Though South Los Angeles was ravaged by violent riots in 1992, USC remained steadfast in its commitment to the community.
Homeland security: From climbing the trees in front of Moreton Fig as a child to patrolling campus, DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas’ Trojan spirit runs deep.
Structural integrity: A walk through historic University Park: The neighborhood surrounding campus is filled with architectural treasures that serve as a tribute to Los Angeles’ rich history.
Watchful eyes: How DPS and LAPD monitor the university: The Department of Public Safety draws support from LAPD in patrolling a school positioned in the midst of a major metropolis.
For schools near USC, it’s all part of the family: What began as a partnership between USC and the five grade schools closest to campus has become a staple of university life.
The changing face of Figueroa: As the area south of Downtown Los Angeles crumbled throughout the 1990s, a partnership emerged to turn things around.
Progress is the plan for university and community: Though USC’s Master Plan has been met with various waves of resistance since its introduction, it will benefit all parties involved.
It takes a village: As the university’s 20-year Master Plan comes closer to becoming reality, USC continues to consider the community.
