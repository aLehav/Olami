Three Trojans — Gussie Johns and Kerrigan Miller of women’s lacrosse and Gabby Smith of women’s tennis — were honored as Players of the Week by their respective conferences after their play last week. Johns, a junior goaltender, was named MPSF Defensive Player of the Week, while Miller, a freshman midfielder, was named MPSF Rookie of the Week. Smith, a junior, also earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for the second time this season.
Johns and Miller were recognized after their stellar play over the weekend, leading the No. 3 USC women’s lacrosse team (2-0) to a big 11-10 overtime win against rival No. 9 Northwestern.
Johns, a junior goalie for the Trojans and current member of the U.S. Women’s National Team, made a handful of key stops against the Wildcats on Saturday, including a crucial one-on-one save early in the overtime period to keep USC’s winning hopes alive. The Washington, D.C. native led the nation in goals-against average last season (6.04) and has maintained that level of play in 2017. In the game against Northwestern, Johns recorded career-highs of 17 saves and eight ground balls to keep the Wildcats’ high-powered offense at bay. Those 17 saves (on 35 shots) accounted for the second most saves in a single game in USC history, while the eight ground balls tied the program record and was the third-highest total in MPSF conference history. The Defensive Player of the Week award is the third of Johns’ career and her fourth award overall.
Miller, the top-ranked recruit in the country coming out of Bayport-Blue Point High School in Bayport, N.Y., has lived up to the billing in this early part of the 2017 season. In addition to scoring the first hat trick of her career on Saturday, the freshman midfielder caused three turnovers and recorded two ground balls and one draw control in addition to scoring the game-winning goal with just four seconds left in overtime. For her efforts, Miller was also named InsideLacrosse National Rookie of the Week. This marks the freshman’s first career MPSF weekly award, and she is the school’s first Rookie of the Week since Johns was selected in March of 2015.
Johns, Miller and the rest of the Trojans will now head out east when they battle against No. 4 Florida in Gainesville, Fla. on Friday at 3:30 p.m.
In addition, Gabby Smith, a junior on the women’s tennis team, earned her second Pac-12 Player of the Week honor this season after extending her winning streak to 10 straight matches over the weekend. The Henderson, Nev., native is currently ranked No. 25 in the nation in singles play after gutting out a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 win against Terri Fleming of UCLA on Saturday.
Smith has been USC’s most consistent contributor this spring, defeating five nationally ranked competitors over the course of the season. She is also currently ranked No. 47 nationally in doubles play with senior partner Zöe Katz. The nod is the third of Smith’s career all-time and her second weekly honor in 2017 after winning the same award on Jan. 23. Now, she and the rest of the Trojans will gear up for a big matchup against California in Berkeley, Calif. at noon on Saturday.

Best of the best · Freshman Minyon Moore passes the ball for USC. Moore earned Freshman of the Week from the Pac-12 and the USBWA – Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
Freshman guard Minyon Moore continues to be recognized for her breakout season as a newcomer for the women’s basketball team. Just one day after capturing the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week Award — her second of the season — Moore was honored as the  USBWA National Freshman of the Week.
The Trojans’ second leading scorer at 11.8 points per game, Moore put together a career high 32 points in a 80-64 win against Washington State last Friday. Against No. 9 Washington on Sunday, it looked as if Moore would be unable to follow up her best performance to date, as she managed just 1 point in the first half. However, she suddenly burst back into the spotlight, scoring 14 in the third quarter to anchor a major Trojan comeback. USC was down by 19 at halftime, but after a buzzer-beater three by Moore, the score was 63-56 heading into the fourth quarter.
While her team eventually lost a hard-fought battle to the Huskies, Moore finished with 20 points and six assists to cap off a memorable weekend for the 18-year-old from Hercules, Calif. Moore has only started a handful of games, due to the experience and shooting prowess of senior Courtney Jaco at her position.
However, Moore has been given starter’s minutes and has been trusted in crunch-time situations, despite her being the youngest player on the roster. In five of the past six games, she has logged 25 or more minutes. She has made the most of her extended time off the bench, leading the team with 4.2 assists per game.
The Trojans will rely on Moore to carry her scoring outburst into a string of important games leading up to tournament play. This weekend, the Trojans head on the road to face Arizona and Arizona State in the last contests of the regular season. The team will then travel to Seattle for the Pac-12 Tournament, which begins March 2.

For seven innings, the Trojans fought to find any consistent offense against Long Beach State. For seven innings Dirtbags pitcher John Castro had USC’s lineup on its toes, allowing just six hits and zero runs.
“I thought Castro pitched phenomenally well for them today,” head coach Dan Stubbs said. “He had three pitches working and he kept us off balance.”
But in a wild Tuesday night game that lasted four hours and featured 11 innings, the first seven frames merely served as prelude. The Trojans needed one major play to get back into the game, and junior Lars Nootbaar provided just that. Down 2-0 in the bottom of the eighth with two outs and a man on second, the center fielder blasted a moonshot that sailed over the right field fence. With that two-run homer, a Trojans’ offense that had been largely dormant up until that point came alive.
“Honestly it’s one of the greatest feelings,” Nootbaar said. “Just knowing you squared a ball up, it’s almost as if you didn’t even feel it. It’s one of those things where right at contact, you know it’s going out. Just seeing my teammates enjoy it was really the best part.”
While Nootbaar’s home run gave the team a chance to win, solid pitching from a very young rotation kept the Trojans afloat up until that point. Junior Mason Perryman performed admirably — if slightly erratically — in only his fourth career start. He gave up just five hits but also hit three batters, at one point nailing two in a row to load the bases. After four innings, he was replaced by sophomore Quinten Longrie, who gave up one hit in nine outs, with five strikeouts.
“We’re relying on a lot of young guys,” Stubbs said. “You think about the pitching that was out there today; I think Mason probably has 25 innings of college experience, Longrie might have 2 or 3 innings of college experience and the other guys have zero. We’re going to be a work in progress a little bit.”
With the game tied at two at the top of the ninth, Stubbs made the bold decision to send freshman Austin Manning out to the mound. The lefty looked confident at first, striking out LBSU second baseman Jarron Duran. But then he gave up a double followed by a perfectly executed RBI sacrifice fly to center field. Manning managed to get out of the inning giving up only the one run, but the Trojans once again found themselves in a do-or-die situation heading into the bottom of the ninth.
This time, however, they didn’t need Nootbaar’s hot bat. With two freshman pinch runners, John Thomas and Christian Moya, at the corners senior Cris Perez came up to bat with two outs. As Thomas attempted to steal from first base, LBSU catcher David Baneulos overthrew the second baseman, allowing Moya to score off of the error. The Trojans left the inning with a 3-3 tie, meaning that fans at Dedeaux Field would be treated to a late night of extra innings.
Both teams failed to score in the 10th inning. Manning produced a three up, three down inning on the defensive end and then senior AJ Fritts was unable to bring junior Adalberto Carrillo home from third with one out.
After Manning once again prevented the Dirtbags from scoring in the top of the 11th, the Trojans  seemed destined to finally finish the game. First Brandon Perez reached first base when LBSU’s center fielder dropped a routine flyball. Then he reached second off of a wild pickoff throw to first base. The Dirtbags’ pitcher Chris Rivera intentionally walked Matthew Acosta and Tyler Urbach leaving the bases loaded with zero outs.
Despite the odds stacked in their favor, the Trojans still did not make ending the game a simple task. Cris Perez and David Edson both struck out, leaving junior shortstop Frankie Rios up to bat with two outs and the game on the line. Rios immediately got down 0-2 in the count, and for a minute it looked as though USC had squandered another golden opportunity — except it had not. Rios blasted a walk-off single to center field and was immediately mobbed by an army of exhausted teammates.
“I was excited,” Rios said. “I wasn’t doing all too well, and then I got that hit. I saw it off the bat, and I was pumped.”
On the game, Nootbaar produced a memorable performance, going 3-4 with a home run and two RBI. On the season, he is batting .688 with two homers.
A positive sign for USC going forward was the season debut of senior leader Corey Dempster following a knee injury. The outfielder came into the eighth inning as a pinch hitter and singled on the first pitch he saw.
After defeating LBSU, the Trojans travel to North Carolina on Friday for games against Wake Forest and Duke.

During their gym period, the ninth graders at Green Dot Animo South Los Angeles Charter High School are restless.  They want to talk to their friends and play basketball.
Eventually, members of USC Peer Health Exchange manage to corral them and settle them in for a lesson on the importance of health education.
As the high schools around Los Angeles are usually underfunded and understaffed, health classes are not a part of the core curriculum. Often, the lessons are the only exposure the students have to helpful and accurate information about health, and the only opportunity for them to ask questions in a safe and nonjudgmental environment.
Armed with lessons and workshop materials, Peer Health Exchange visits high schools once or twice a week to teach students in their health classes. Peer Health Exchange was started in 1999 by a group of Yale University graduates and has since grown into a national nonprofit organization. Boasting chapters in major areas all over the United States, including Chicago, Washington, D.C., Boston, New York City, the Bay Area and Los Angeles, the organization matches local high schools with college students looking for experience in the health or education fields.
Martha Wolnicki, a junior majoring in neuroscience, and Rachel Belzer, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, act as co-presidents of the USC branch, taking on administrative duties and evaluating the workshop materials to ensure they will run smoothly.
“We have a series of 13 workshops where we talk about accessing resources, how to find health information and decision-making regarding sex, drugs and alcohol,” Belzer said. “We also do communication and advocacy, teaching these students how to stand for themselves, how to communicate and how to get information they need if it’s not readily available.”
Wolnicki said the team offers services local students typically lack.
“A lot of the time these students don’t really have accurate sources of information, so it’s important that we clarify their questions,” Wolnicki said. “They need to have proper information so they can make the right decisions for themselves and others.”
The program offers a chance to experience work in the health education field, gives members a head start on their future professions and endows them with new skills.
Kathleen Tor, a senior majoring in biological sciences, had no teaching experience prior to joining Peer Health Exchange but said she gained a lot out of the program.
“I’ve discovered that I really enjoy teaching, breaking down information and passing it down to students,” Tor said. “For volunteers, PHE is an opportunity to follow their passion for health promotion while simultaneously giving back to the community.
Christopher Lees, a senior majoring in human biology, said he wanted to extend his reach beyond the bubble of USC and connect with the wider L.A. community.
“To be able to communicate with the younger demographic of Los Angeles is something I take a lot of pride in,” Lees said. “I’m planning to matriculate into medical school in the fall, and it’s given me a better range of what I can expect in the medical field because these are the next generation of people that are coming through. Empowering students to make their own healthy decisions is something I’m a really big proponent of, and this was one of the best programs for me to do that.”

Creating connections · Bioscience and biotechnology students chatted with professionals in the field at Irani Hall on Wednesday – Dhrumkumar Patel | Daily Trojan
On Feb. 22, around 200 students from the Los Angeles area were invited to attend the Bioscience Talent Connection fair to partake in company-led information sessions and workshops. Biotech Connection Los Angeles hosted the fair, an event aimed at providing life science students the opportunity to attend a full-day networking experience with Southern California’s top biotech companies at Irani Hall.
BCLA is a non-profit organization run by students, young professionals and post-doctoral students.
“What we do is educate our community about biotech, not only to increase diversity in this field, because we need it, but also to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs in the L.A. community,” said Carolina Amador, vice president of Biotech Connection Los Angeles and a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying bio organic chemistry.
A few of the 10 groups that sponsored the event included Cell Care Therapeutics, Corning and USC’s Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering.
Most students at the fair were graduate students. Seniors, especially those searching for internships, and faculty also attended.
The fair began with a career panel, which educated students about alternative careers in the field. The discussion provided examples of working professionals who studied life sciences and their subsequent career paths.
These discussions aimed to demonstrate unconventional applications of life sciences. For instance, the discussion exemplified that life scientists can use their training to work in management, consulting, business development, scientific affairs and medical writings.
“We put everyone in the room so that we can understand our opportunities as students,” Amador said.
The discussion also stressed the significance of students getting involved in nonprofit organizations.
“The goal for these alternative career channels was for every student to know the different type of roles you can have and how to get to them,” Amador said.
Networking opportunities allowed students to work their people skills.
The afternoon also put students’ career skills to practice. They were asked to bring their updated resumes and dress professionally. Some companies interested in hiring students conducted on-the-spot interviews.
“The most important thing is to meet people and exchange ideas because most of the times, we are stuck in our lab and we are just focusing on certain applications,” said Mustafa Daloglu, a graduate student at UCLA. “It’s really narrow.”
This type of event was the second one of its nature hosted at USC. Last year, the fair featured resume seminars and building LinkedIn profiles.
Feedback forms from last year indicated that there was a heightened demand for more involvement for the Bioscience Talent Connection fair. Although there was an increase in the number of sponsors that attended, from six to 10 companies, there is a need for more investment from the USC community.
“For this to become even bigger, we need support from faculty and managers,” Amador said.
BCLA hosts other events, including seminars, symposiums and networking mixers. The next event will be held on Thursday at the Health Science Campus.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated Carolina Amador was a second-year Ph.D. student. She is a fourth-year Ph.D. student. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Created less than two years ago by club President Steven Nguyen, the USC Japanese Exchange Student Support has worked to bridge the gap between international Japanese students and Americans. JESS was named the Cultural Organization of the 2015-2016 school year and supports more than seven Japanese universities.
“Going to a different country and culture is often very difficult, but there are always people who are willing to help,” Nguyen said. “The USC Japanese Exchange Student Supporters gather USC students who are interested in helping Japanese exchange students.”
With 34 Japanese students and roughly 60 USC students, JESS is just over 100 members and growing. The organization works by offering events around Los Angeles, including trips to nearby museums and tourist attractions in addition to holiday and cultural parties.
Erick Chen, a freshman majoring in East Asian Area Studies, grew up in Taiwan and is a member of JESS.
“JESS has helped me explore different parts of L.A. I probably would not have know about or went to without the club,” Chen said. “JESS has lots of social events and we go to places like Little Tokyo to go to karaoke and eat together. It has helped me realized just how multicultural and diverse L.A. is.”
The organization uses their Facebook group as a log for documenting their experiences with JESS, much like a community journal or blog where peers can then review for grammar.
JESS also provides a forum for students to learn about Japan, rather than just through books.
“I think at its core, JESS is a social club where people can meet new friends and exchange in cross-cultural communication,” Chen said. “Through the many friends I have met because of JESS, I have learned so much more about Japan that is not in my Japanese textbooks.”
Jimmy Elder, a junior majoring in Japanese, recently joined JESS for its cultural, academic and social benefits.
“I think JESS has been beneficial with my Japanese class because it allows me to converse with native Japanese speakers and makes me feel comfortable speaking Japanese,” Elder said. “In turn, I think it is helpful for the Japanese students in giving them the chance to talk to and socialize with native English speakers. When I heard about JESS and the opportunity to help welcome Japanese exchange students to our community, I decided to sign up.”
Although JESS is known as a cultural educational group, most members agree that JESS is much more than that. It is a place that nurtures communication across cultures and cultivates new friendships.
“The USC supporters will help answer questions, host cultural exchange events and themed parties, show Japanese students around California and make the Japanese students feel like USC is their new home,” Nguyen said. “The Japanese students are currently our guests, but soon they will be our friends and a part of the Trojan Family.”

To state simply, Moonlight deserves to win the Oscar for best picture. In a year marred by contentious politics, filmmakers took the first step toward transformative storytelling with unique, compelling and groundbreaking features. And while Manchester by the Sea and La La Land are no exception to this trend, Barry Jenkins’ breakout hit Moonlight artistically tells an honest and touching story.
Though the film is an adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney’s In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, Jenkins transformed the story into a visually arresting work. Moonlight examines themes of homosexuality and masculinity through the lens of protagonist Chiron — a gay African American man who grows up in the face of bullying, poverty and abuse from his drug-addicted mother.
Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and the various portrayals of Chiron and Kevin successfully tell a multi-faceted, heartbreaking story — one that resonates with me, and with so many young men in the world struggling to grapple with their identities. And as muted and silent as the film feels at times, it perfectly encapsulates Chiron’s burying of his emotions and his pain. Moonlight begs the question of whether true storytelling requires a happy ending, because in the end, reality can be bittersweet.
There is no doubt that Jenkins’ direction contributed greatly to the masterpiece; he plays with ordinary settings like a crack house to create a breathtaking image that leaves viewers immersed in Chiron’s blue (and black) world.
Moonlight is not only an artistic masterpiece, but also a beacon of hope for the changing film industry. As with its fellow contender La La Land, Moonlight is a film that has flipped Hollywood upside down as an artistic reflection of real-life stories. However, it is also one that has sparked many conversations — ones that mark the importance of diversity in media, and that also recognize the need to tell stories that transcend the silver screen.

In a sea of exquisite Best Picture nominees, Hidden Figures deserves to take home the Academy Award. The film follows the behind-the-scenes story of African American mathematicians Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) as they aim to send the first men into space for NASA in the 1960s. With the Civil Rights Movement as the backdrop, Hidden Figures serves as the perfect clapback to the #OscarsSoWhite controversy that has plagued the Academy for the past two years.
Moreover, during a time when the majority of main characters on screen are still white men, Hidden Figures shatters the patriarchy by demonstrating that heroes can be brilliant women of color. A series of scenes illustrated their inspiring geniusness: Katherine whizzes through the calculations to send astronaut John Glenn to space, leaving the other NASA officials with their mouths agape. Dorothy leads her team to develop an advanced programming language that transformed the landscape of computation at NASA. Mary challenges the courts to win over her right to become NASA’s first black female engineer.
Ultimately, films are a direct reflection of the current cultural milieu, and it is because of this that Best Picture winners carry immense weight. We live in an era when the unity of our nation hangs in limbo, so the Best Picture embraces our differences. La La Land will probably win the Oscar for its musical ingenuity and Emma Stone’s charm, but Hidden Figures — more than just a feel-good movie about three little women that could — scintillates beyond just this year.

With the raving reviews La La Land received, I was hesitant to watch the movie in early December; I even avoided the YouTube and Spotify commercials that kept popping up, until I heard the first song of the musical, “Another Day of Sun.” I am a shameless fan of musicals — on and off Broadway — and Justin Hurwitz’s score essentially sold me the movie.
Nevertheless, without the music, the vibrant colors and spontaneous ballroom dancing, I don’t think La La Land would have a chance at Best Picture compared to Moonlight’s touching story and Hidden Figures’ empowering message. But, La La Land offers its audience the full package: It was a story of love and loss in the City of Angels that stole the hearts of lovers and dreamers alike, as they followed Mia and Sebastian on their winding journey. Justin Hurwitz’s phenomenal, dynamic score brought their journey to life on the bright technicolor screen. But take away the score, or replace it with one less powerful, and the movie loses most of its magic.
Although La La Land is most likely to sweep the Awards Sunday night, Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight should not be neglected. Moonlight did not rely on a well-known cast or a captivating soundtrack to boost it to acclaim. It is raw and soulfully realistic in its character portrayals.
The movie paints a heartwarming, intimate picture of two gay black men, while giving them a background beyond the “gay” label. Moonlight effectively shatters the unspoken stereotypes of the gay community and black America through its striking message, creating an artful storyline through three stages of its protagonist’s life. Moonlight shines in its cinematography and fosters hope in its love story to audiences of all ages. For these reasons and in my identity as a bisexual woman of color, Moonlight’s message hits home in my heart.

Though the top three movies I watched in 2016 were all foreign and not all are being recognized at the Oscars, I am rooting for Moonlight to win best picture. Moonlight is one of the most original films I have ever seen. 2016 was a year fraught with political tension and in Moonlight we found relief — not through magic or escapism, but through the quiet assurance that movies about non-mainstream America will continue to be told and valued.
Of course, there is no such thing as mainstream or non-mainstream America, but try telling that to homogenous Hollywood. Though it is useless to praise Moonlight only for the strides it makes in diversity (the movie features not one white face in its entire duration) — fortunately, the film sows progress in both art and message. The film spins the viewer out over the course of one gay black man’s life in three phases, from that of a small, bullied boy to a tired man wrapped tightly in his own mute masculinity.
Moonlight breaks your heart but it also fills you with a subtler and more difficult emotion: peace. At its core, Moonlight is about a romance, one so rich and vital that it lasts a lifetime. The film is layered and unexpected, which is more than I can say for La La Land, Hell or High Water and Hacksaw Ridge — three other movies nominated for Best Picture this year.
As someone who plans to pursue a career in this industry, and as someone who grew up in a community where no one else looked like her, I believe above almost anything that films should be judged in two regards: in artistic merit, and in the conversations that they spark. Moonlight vaulted through both components when most movies don’t even had one, and in its quietness it rocketed the potential for what kinds of stories can be told about what sorts of people (all of them) to unparalleled horizons.

The Oscars are coming up this Sunday, and one of my favorite categories — aside from the directing, acting, writing and other highly anticipated categories — is Best Original Score.
While La La Land is the favorite right now, I’m rooting for Moonlight because the music in the film fully immerses audiences in main character Chiron’s psyche to understand his emotions.
That’s just one of the many important roles music has in film. One of my favorite scores is from The Social Network because composer Trent Razor reimagined the soundtrack and adjusted it relative to the movie’s elitist, ambitious, selective, young, pompous, sardonic and intelligent environment. It’s very minimalist in nature as well, and it shows how you don’t need every instrument in a traditional orchestra to create a solid score.
Essentially, The Social Network, like many other films, wouldn’t be what it is without the score. The boat race scene wouldn’t have the drama and intrigue that it does without Razor’s version of “In the Hall of the Mountain King.” It’s also worth mentioning that horror movies are the same way, and they rely on their sound and score the most out of any type of film.
Eli Roth, a horror movie director, once said that people who are afraid in a horror movie shouldn’t close their eyes, but should “[c]lose their ears instead.” What’s scaring you during a horror movie aren’t the images on screen; rather, it’s the intense music and sounds that are making your heart race at a rapid pace. A jump scare works because the sound is cut out after a frenzy of sound, and you’re left anxiously anticipating the return of that sound.
Of course, there are some cases in which a horror movie does not need a soundtrack or score to make the audience feel scared, such as The Blair Witch Project. But for nearly every other horror movie, a great score can make a bad horror movie a great horror movie.
Think about what kind of movie Psycho would be without those frantic strings that play throughout the film. In a class I took at USC with Professor Jon Burlingame, we were shown a clip from Psycho where Vera Miles’ character is shown driving her car at night with the score playing behind it. We were then shown the same clip with the score removed, and the entire meaning of the scene was changed.
In the scene with the score, it looks like a woman is in grave danger and that something bad is about to happen to her. Without the music, it simply looks like she’s enjoying a nice drive in the evening. Music in film has this power, and people are thankfully starting to catch on to not only a score’s importance in a film, but the use of non-original songs as well.

Everyone remembers when Adele first released “Skyfall” before the critically acclaimed James Bond film of the same name’s release. The song is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Bond themes ever made, and it definitely helped to sell the movie, which is also one of the greatest Bond movies ever made. Hearing the song during the stylish opening credits was a delightful example of a synergistic relationship between a movie and its music, and it’s not the only one.
Try to imagine The Departed without the song “I’m Shipping Up to Boston,” Risky Business without “Old Time Rock and Roll,” and, on a less serious note, Shrek without “All Star.” It’s impossible not to associate these songs with their respective movies because of how well they work in those movies.
Every time I’m studying for an exam and a track from the Inception score comes on from my study playlist, I want to drop everything I’m doing. That film, along with others, has a soundtrack that I could listen to in a non-ironic fashion. Others with non-traditional scores sometimes have a soundtrack so good you wouldn’t even guess it was made for a movie if nobody told you.
Films like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Submarine are two movies with soundtracks that not only work for the films as a creative aspect, but also have soundtracks that are just great albums to listen to, the latter created by Alex Turner from the Arctic Monkeys.
Music in movies thankfully isn’t as overlooked as it could be, but I still think that its importance is understated. It’s definitely as important as the acting, writing, cinematography and everything else that makes a movie great, and the composer of the score is just as important as its director. So the next time you think about a scene or a movie that has really impacted you, think about the music that went into that scene.

In early February, Rawan Tayoon joined hundreds of protesters at the Los Angeles International Airport to speak out against President Donald Trump’s ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. Tayoon, a sophomore majoring in political science, is a social activist who works with Syrian refugees, and said that she saw the impact Trump’s actions had on her peers.
“I have a friend who is a refugee from Syria, who has been here for about a year and a half now and was waiting for his grandmother to get asylum and join them,” Tayoon said. “The reality for Syrian refugees is that the ban is still indefinite and my friend cannot go see her, nor can she come see them, and this was very emotional for me to see.”

Trump’s initial executive order barred citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days, and blocked entry to Syrian refugees for 120 days. Though a recent amendment exempts green card holders and those with valid visas, many students at USC are still feeling the impact of the order. According to data collected by College Factual from the Department of Homeland Security in 2015, USC has 252 students on visas from the temporarily banned countries, the second-highest number of student visas of any university in the United States after Texas A&M University.
Varun Soni, dean of the Office of Religious Life, said he was concerned when the order came out a few weeks ago because he saw that it had a dramatic impact on students and staff at USC. Soni said that approximately 200 of the affected students at USC were from Iran.
“Fortunately, our semester starts early and so all our students were already on campus when the travel ban happened,” Soni said. “So, we did not have students who were stranded outside the United States.”
However, many students began to question what the ban meant on their ability to travel internationally, the ability of their families to come visit them during graduation and its effect on future employment opportunities. Students were uncertain of the scope of the ban and what it meant along with how it was being applied.
Somayeh, an international student from Iran who requested that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy, expressed her frustration with the executive order.
“I felt very sad and disappointed,” Somayeh said. “None of these seven countries had any history of terrorism in the U.S. Seeing our family is the first need of human rights for everybody, regardless of which country you were born.”
When the travel ban was first issued,  many citizens of the affected countries were immediately detained and deported, creating chaos and confusion at airports around the United States. Somayeh said that she watched videos of the events as they were occurring and sympathized with the people who were sent back to their countries of origin.
“It was very sad [to be] humiliated for carrying the name of particular countries [where] you were born,” Somayeh said. “The diversity and welcoming intelligent people made the U.S. a great country for now [but] not for the future.”
The Association of American Universities, which represents over 60 leading research universities in the United States, including USC, denounced the ban shortly after it was announced. According to the statements released by the AAU, Trump should rescind the travel ban because of its negative impact on students and should reiterate the United States’ commitment to be the leader in the higher education of the world.
“We cannot be the leader without freedom of thought movement,” Soni said. “We cannot recruit the best and brightest student scholars in the world if there is a travel ban, which seems to undermine our values as a research institute.”
Apart from those who were from the seven countries, several students from other Muslim-majority countries also raised concerns, as they are still unsure if the travel ban would include other Muslim countries in the future or not. Soni said that a Pakistani student approached him because he wanted to visit Pakistan for his brother’s wedding, but Soni advised him not to. Soni also recently told an Indonesian student not to leave the country for a community service-based spring break trip.
“It broke my heart to do so,” Soni said. “We are at a point where many of our students just have a bunch of bad options. Yes, it’s true that Pakistan is not on that list, but what happens if suddenly there is a new executive order when he is abroad?”
Faisal, a Ph.D. student at USC, who requested that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, has similar fears even though he is from Saudi Arabia, a country which is currently not included in the travel ban. Faisal is equally worried for his friends from Iran, as he thinks their future is now uncertain.
“It’s really scary to come across such news,” Faisal said. “I am afraid to go back to see my family, afraid that while I am there they might include Saudi Arabia in the list of banned countries.”
According to Soni, USC is a diverse global community with students from more than 130 different countries, representing every religion in the world and with different perspectives and experiences. Soni said that USC is working very carefully and closely with students, both at the undergraduate and graduate level, who have been or will be admitted from the seven countries affected by the travel ban to make sure they are accommodated.
“You are part of the Trojan family and what it means to be a part of the Trojan family is that you are loved, valued, cherished and celebrated,” Soni said. “I don’t want the students to feel like they are alone in any of this, whether they are international, undocumented or Muslim students. I want them to know that the University cares a lot about them and that there are resources on campus to support them.”
Again kids, The executive order is not a travel ban, but a “stay’ on allowing folks from coming into our country without the proper paperwork or being vetted for alliance to countries and ideologies that are harmful to Americans or in conflict with American laws and values.  If you have the paperwork approved and legitimized, then you are free to roam about the country.  Be careful about what you read and listen to from the MSM, as they and their handlers are out to gain control of your life, either through government regulations, taxes, entitlements, and other methods of keeping you aligned to the Left.  America is a country whose laws are based on Judeo Christian beliefs, nothing more.
Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more that makes being an international student difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on their life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   An award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!
For those of us, like me, who have been a foreign student in a country where English is not spoken, and did this well before the current level of hand-holding and over-support evolved, this whole articles smacks as made up.  Yeah it took some getting used to, to get around in France in the 1980s.  Americans like me worked it out without special help and it did incentivize your to actually learn the language ASAP.  I guess what I’m saying is that this is not really a problem, rather just another excuse for virtue signaling.  Exaggeration is not helpful, and this article is that with an anti-Trump twist.

Director Ezra Edelman wants viewers to know one thing — in the case of The People v. O.J. Simpson, it was not Simpson who was on trial, but rather the city of Los Angeles. Edelman’s Oscar-nominated documentary O.J.: Made in America is an intelligent and provocative retelling of how decades of turmoil between black and white Los Angeles came to a head in one tumultuous trial.
“This is the story of Los Angeles more than anything else,” Edelman said in an interview with film critic Elvis Mitchell. “It’s all about what this place has brought in terms of the people who live here in these two very different L.A.s. And in this way, it is a microcosm of the country.”
Edelman portrays Los Angeles as a city with a split identity: There is its predominantly white side, portrayed through Hollywood glamour, and then its black regions, overrun by poverty and police brutality. O.J. gives an exhaustive history of racial conflict in Los Angeles, beginning in 1965, when Watts burned right next to the affluent white bubble of USC, until 1991, when the beating of Rodney King and the murder of Latasha Harlins occurred 13 days apart. This painful history is necessary to understand the black community’s sentiments preceding Simpson’s trial.
“You needed to emotionally connect with what was happening, with the struggles of black people in this city — in general, every day, also at the hands of the police,” Edelman said. “It couldn’t be ‘A happened, then B happened, then C happened.’ It’s not intellectual, it’s emotional.”
The black community’s pain culminated in Simpson’s 1995 murder trial, when decades of police racism made the defense’s accusation of an LAPD conspiracy seem plausible. The defense labored to portray Simpson as a symbol of black oppression; to make their defendant seem “more black,” they even planted photos of Simpson with black people in his house. Court discussions turned from the incriminating evidence against Simpson to racial injustice, and acquittal was framed as payback for Rodney King.
“People who didn’t have that experience in life, they didn’t understand why so many black people were connected to this, why they were rooting for [Simpson] — whether they were actually rooting for him or rooting for something bigger than him,” Edelman said.
When the predominantly black jury acquitted Simpson, for many black people signified that the justice system was finally treating them fairly. For most white people, however, it was an appalling case of a gruesome murderer getting off on “the race card.” Edelman conducted intimate interviews with important figures on both sides, stressing the need for empathy.
“Everyone dotted this landscape, and whether you’re a policeman, or an athlete, a celebrity, preacher, civil rights worker, whoever, we’re all living in this same space at the same time and in this extraordinary circumstance which has brought us all together,” Edelman said. “You need to understand where everyone was before that to get it.”
Complicating the trial further was Simpson, an unlikely figure to represent civil rights. Though the enormity of his commercial success broke ground for many black public figures, Simpson often distanced himself from the black community, famously stating, “I’m not black, I’m O.J.” Throughout his career, he shunned opportunities to raise awareness of black issues, choosing instead to achieve mainstream appeal by integrating himself with white society. Edelman sympathizes somewhat with Simpson’s goal.
“I can defend the idea of ‘I’m not black, I’m O.J.,’” Edelman said. “People go, ‘Oh, he wanted to be white even though he’s black,’ but that wasn’t the issue. He just wanted to not be held down because of his blackness, period.”
Simpson’s actions raise provocative questions: Do people have a responsibility to help uplift members of their own race? Is it delusional to try to erase racial identity? O.J. reveals Simpson’s complex character — he is a privileged black man who shunned his racial identity for commercial success, only to exploit his race to get out of a murder charge. His story remains relevant today, and its discussion on race extends far beyond the documentary’s hefty, nearly eight-hour duration.
“The true scope of it, the context of it, where all this came from — high and low, black and white — it didn’t start five years before [the trial], it started when the country started,” Edelman said. “There’s something in here that speaks to everybody, and I think that’s also what makes this story so compelling. This is the perfect American story, and I do think that in many ways, it is the defining cultural story of the last half century in America.”

A petition for Africana studies at USC and the employment of a black professor in the history department brings to light a serious issue on this campus, specifically within its history department, that has not yet been solved: representation of the African American community among professors and doctoral students of history and the availability of courses.
The authors of the petition are calling for “the history department [to] hire a traveling scholar, or a professor of Africana studies or African-American history to teach black history courses.”
USC has undeniably made notable efforts to create a more culturally inclusive campus climate for students of color in recent years. One recent and overt example of this support can be seen in the signs on Trousdale Parkway that spread awareness of and encourage celebration of Black History Month.
However, there is much work to be done. Representation in education and the integration of multiple perspectives on subject matter, especially in the subject of history, are arguably the most important ways that the University can actively create an academic environment and community that is inclusive to its fullest extent. Studying the African diaspora and its history through the field of Africana studies is a powerful and informative way for students of all races to understand the horror of institutions of oppressions such as the Atlantic slave trade. Africana studies would educate non-black students about aspects of the past that may not directly affect them, but will instill in them empathy for their peers and a desire to learn from the mistakes of history.
These efforts are important to pursue if the University seeks to rectify damages and abuses of the past. For the better part of U.S. history, American universities were incubators of political and social privilege which excluded black communities, and USC was certainly no exception to this trend. It was not until five years after its founding that the University declared that no student would be barred from entry on the basis of “race, color, religion or sex.” In  1903, a black student named John Alexander Somerville caused an uproar among the mostly white students on campus for enrolling to study dentistry. It’s important that this oft-untold history is taught to students in institutions of higher learning, and it is crucial that we allow this story to be told and represented by individuals who were affected by this history.
Furthermore, USC’s history department has participated in the perpetuation of a Western-dominated narrative of history. In spite of its current institutional dedication to inclusion of a variety of minority communities, it seems that the history department still has not entirely rid itself of the remnants of this exclusive and damaging academic practice. According to the petition, over the course of its 137 years, USC has had only two black doctoral students accepted to study in its history department.
Although two black professors currently teach in the history department, they will be leaving the University in May. As the petition also points out, “USC does not have enough GE courses or history courses teaching the broad and international perspective of the African diaspora, Great Black Civilization.” Overall, these problems demonstrate the lack of appropriate representation of black history at USC.
Ultimately, USC’s history department must prove its dedication to an open-minded, holistic study of history by responding to this petition and putting in more effort to be inclusive of black narratives in its subject matter and faculty members. The colonial legacy of our society and its oppression of black people and other people of color is important for us to learn about as students. In its call for an Africana diaspora studies class, the authors of this petition give a specific answer to the question of how these narratives can be included among USC’s fields of study. Institutions of higher learning are obligated to offer well-rounded history curriculum, and USC’s history department must prioritize the inclusion of Africana studies in order to achieve this.
We cannot continue to have a single, Eurocentric narrative of history. Doing so directly hurts black students by depriving them of their cultural legacy in education. Implicitly, it tells black students that their narrative is not important because it is not widely studied or respected and is not represented by professors with whom black students can identify.
Black history cannot continue to be sidelined, or we will have learned nothing from the pain, sacrifice and hard work that it took to bring our institution to the inclusive and progressive space that it is still struggling to become today. As the adage goes, those who do not understand and learn from history are doomed to repeat it. We must choose to learn from our history and make every effort to look forward to a more representative future.

Last week, Rewire released a report examining who was responsible for the majority of bills infringing on women’s access to abortion and other reproductive healthcare in 2016 and the first month of 2017. In case you’ve heard the lie — often perpetuated by those with the privilege of seeing their own interests advanced within the system — that the representation of women in politics isn’t important, the report serves as a casual reminder that it absolutely is.
In 2016, 90 percent of the 147 anti-abortion bills introduced in state legislatures and Congress were sponsored by white Republicans. And of the 167 anti-abortion bills introduced in January 2017 alone, 71 percent were sponsored by white Republican men, while 25 percent were sponsored by white Republican women.
Men and some women who will never share the stressful and traumatic experience of an unwanted pregnancy while lacking economic resources and support are calling the shots on what people in such situations are allowed to do. Ideally, empathy among grown adults would not require personal experience. But clearly, this isn’t the case with conservative lawmakers, particularly in rural states with unsettlingly repressive policies governing reproductive health care.
The root of the issue is privilege, and those with an excess of it seem to struggle to relate to those who lack it. As a result, they are unable to fully recognize the humanity of and fight for the human rights of the constituents they are supposedly representing. The issue of women’s rights — from our ability to access reproductive health care to our workplace conditions to the rights of sexual assault survivors — and the men in office who consistently fail to advance them, is obviously nuanced. However, as this latest report by Rewire reveals, the heart of the matter is relatively simple.
Male conservative lawmakers, often of majority-Christian, white and wealthy origins, are unable to relate to and fully recognize the humanity of low-income women of color with different values. This apathy and perhaps even outright disdain for those who are different appears to motivate their unceasing crusade on women’s autonomy and their perceptions of women as less worthy of human rights than fertilized eggs.
Of course, that attacks on reproductive rights are disproportionately to the detriment of low-income minority women, and bills attacking access to women’s healthcare by establishing legal, economic and geographic barriers tend to be sponsored by white male and female Republicans, can’t be ignored either. Historically, restrictions on reproductive rights have led to the entrapment of minority women in intergenerational poverty, as they are forced to birth children they cannot afford, and are sometimes injured in back-alley abortions. Additionally, decades of research have shown that the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding from paying for abortions for low-income women, disproportionately affects women of color.
The issue of prioritizing the ideologies of privileged Americans over the rights and dignities of women, particularly marginalized women, isn’t new, and has always been fundamentally rooted in lack of representation. For the better part of America’s history, women were barred from holding any political office or accessing equal education and employment opportunities.
While the legislative consequences of underrepresentation in politics are particularly underscored by reproductive rights, consider the demographics of lawmakers who vote against bills to alleviate causes of gender pay inequality. When Vice President Mike Pence voted against fair pay legislation several times throughout 2007 and 2009 while in the House, perhaps his votes had something to do with the fact that he had never been overlooked for a raise or promotion nor been discriminated against for having or potentially having a family on the basis of his gender.
Consider the sexual orientations of the lawmakers who vote in favor of pro-religious freedom bills that enable LGBTQ discrimination. When Sen. Ted Cruz staked his failed presidential campaign on this platform, perhaps his position had something to do with the fact that he had never been evicted by a landlord for espousing different views.
Consider the gender of judges who harass and undermine the experiences of sexual assault survivors. When Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Stanford rapist Brock Turner to just six months in jail, perhaps his decision had something to do with the fact that he had never been blamed for inciting harassment and, in extreme cases, even sexual assault due to his state of dress.
Political underrepresentation of women and, in particular, women of color, perpetuates a vicious cycle of oppression that, frankly, only increased diversity in politics at every level could alleviate.

25% of all state legislatures are women, so 25% of any type of bill being introduced by women is to be expected.
90% of all state legislatures are white, so 90% of any type of bill being introduced by whites is to be expected.  In fact, the statistics presented show no tendency for any particular demographic group to be likelier to propose an anti-abortion bill.
 While blacks are about 13% of the population, and are therefore somewhat underrepresented, the difference between 10% and 13% is not ideal but it is small and shrinking.  Women are much more underrepresented — yet you seem upset that there are too many white women in the legislature.
There are pro-lifers of every demographic and there are pro-abortioners of every demographic.  Don’t introduce mindless quotas — encourage people to go vote.

The No. 9 men’s tennis team traded a pair of wins and a loss at the 2017 ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Charlottesville, Va. last weekend.
On Friday, the Trojans were edged out 4-3 by No. 7 crosstown rival UCLA. The Trojans fought hard, but wound up just short of moving past the round of 16 and instead rounded out the weekend in consolation play.
No. 35 pair senior Nick Crystal and sophomore Laurens Verboven started the evening off with a 6-3 win to open doubles play over the Bruins pair of Gage Brymer and Maxime Cressy. UCLA responded quickly with 6-4 win against senior Rob Bellamy and sophomore Jack Jaede. No. 32 freshman tandem Brandon Holt and Riley Smith would fight off a 1-4 deficit and ultimately win 7-5. The comeback win sealed the deal for the Trojans in doubles play.
In singles action, UCLA struck first and tied the matchup at 1-1 when No. 19 Brymer won 6-1, 6-3 against No. 36 sophomore Logan Smith. A 2-1 lead followed when No. 112 Cressy topped No. 97 Bellamy 6-3, 6-2. The Trojans fired back as Crystal beat Zhu via 6-3, 7-5 (5) to tie the game at 2. The Bruins’ Austin Rapp would take a 2-6, 6-3, 6-1 comeback over junior Thibault Forget to go up by one. In that same vein No. 119 Jaede would power back to beat Logan Staggs 4-5, 7-5, 6-2 and set up the Trojans for a tiebreaker against the Bruins on court one.
No. 13 freshman Holt took on No. 73 Redlicki in a winner-take-all matchup. Holt moved first by winning the first set, but it was all UCLA from there as Redlicki grabbed the next two sets to win 6-7 (6), 6-3, 6-4 and secure a 4-3 win for the Bruins, who would lose the remaining games of the tournament.
The Trojans started their Saturday off against another Pac-12 opponent in No. 16 Utah State, which they swept 5-0 in consolation play. For the 11th straight match this season the Trojans started the day with doubles points and claimed the early advantage. Holt and Smith snagged a 6-3 win over Utah State’s Serrano and Wehnelt, while Crystal and Verboven beat Maier and Swindells by the same score to put the Trojans on the board first.
After quick doubles points, USC took the game in straight set victories. Holt beat Jack Swindells 6-1, 6-2 to make it a 2-0 Trojans lead in the first leg of singles action. Logan Smith made it 3-0 against Kai Wehnelt with a 6-3, 6-2 win. Holt’s doubles partner Riley Smith tallied a 6-4, 6-3 win over Jonas Maier to secure victory for the Trojans. Moments later Jack Jaede closed out a 7-6, 6-1 victory over Samuel Serrano to make it 5-0 USC.
USC wrapped up its consolation play against Baylor where they would earn their 10th win of the new year and finish their trip to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships on a high note.
A 4-2 victory over the Baylor Bears kicked off with USC in unfamiliar territory. After earning 11 straight doubles matches points the Trojans saw their top duo of freshmen Brandon Holt and Riley Smith lose 6-0. All was not lost as Crystal and Verboven won 7-6 before Robert Bellamy and Jack Jaede finished 6-2 to put the Trojans up first.
No. 119 Jack Jaede kicked off singles actions with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Will Little to make it 2-0 Trojans. Baylor responded with a 6-2, 7-5 victory by way of Juan Benitez over Brandon Holt. Riley Smith would avenge his partner’s loss with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Constantin Frantzen to put the Trojans up 3-1. The Bears tried to close the gap with a win over Logan Smith by way of 6-2, 6-3 by No. 57 Max Tchoutakian. Thibault Forget capped off the Trojans weekend with a 6-4, 6-3 clincher over Jimmy Bendeck to win the game 4-2.
As for the rest of the teams competing in the tournament, host and No. 1 ranked Virginia defeated No. 3 Ohio State to win the 2017 ITA National Team Indoor Championships.
The Trojans will return home to Marks stadium to take on Cal Poly on Friday, February 23 at 2 p.m. before turning their attention to Stanford at 3 p.m. in nonconference play.

On Friday evening, students braved the pouring rain to hear Emmy Award-winning producer, director and screenwriter Alan Yang speak at Bovard Auditorium, as part of the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s annual speaker event. 
Kyleen Hengelhaupt | Daily Trojan
Yang is known for working on NBC’s popular sitcom Parks and Recreation and for co-creating Netflix original series Master of None, which highlights the Asian American experience by following the life of a 30-year-old Indian American actor, played by co-creator Aziz Ansari.
The show is one of Netflix’s most popular series and won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. Yang attributed the success of the series to its genuity and relatability. 
“We write from personal experience … and put in things that are emotionally truthful,” he said. 
Later on in the night, Yang further expressed his views on how audiences relate to diverse screenwriters. “In doing so, I think a byproduct of that is people end up relating to it even if it’s not their own story.” 
Yang spoke on a variety of topics, including his views on Asian representation in the entertainment industry and his experiences as a filmmaker. Although Yang graduated from Harvard University with a degree in biology, he soon began to pursue comedy and screenwriting. Yang said he worked extremely hard for many years before finally achieving the success he has today.
“A lot of great things have happened to me,” Yang said. “I’ve been very lucky with getting to work on shows that I love with people I love and respect and have learned a lot from.”
Yang expressed how he refrained from writing Asian storylines early on to avoid limiting himself as an “Asian writer” and how a process of maturation was required for him to become more comfortable with incorporating his identity into his work. 
“If I’m not going to try, who’s going to try?” Yang said about writing more diverse roles and perspectives in television.
As evidenced by recent #OscarsSoWhite controversy and a study by USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity & Social
Change Initiative, Hollywood lacks diversity, especially for Asian Americans. Asian representation only makes up a minute percentage of the film and entertainment industry. Yang does not believe this problem is malicious.
“It’s not like these people are discriminating,” Yang said. “When you’re hiring… you have so much stuff on your plate. You fall back on hiring people you’ve worked with before, or know, because the risk of hiring someone who’s a total stranger is a pretty significant risk.”
To combat the industry’s lack of diversity, Yang called for writers to take the initiative to hire new actors.
 “Asian people don’t have the foothold yet … We haven’t been here as long as some other people,” Yang said. “It’s getting people on the ground floor.” 
At the same time, he encouraged Asian Americans to actively seek opportunities and become more vocal and visible.
Yang also offered advice to college students pursuing filmmaking careers. He highlighted the constant uncertainty that comes with working in the entertainment industry, as well as the only way to overcome it.
“Feel so strongly that you’re willing to weather the storms, to be willing to might be unemployed for years,” Yang said. “Do not do it expecting to make money. Do not do it expecting to win awards. You just have to want to actually do the work — figure out what means the most to you, and put that into whatever you’re working on.”

Undergraduate Student Government Senator Kate Oh and Executive Director of the Academic Culture Assembly Luis Vidalon-Suzuki presented a plan to change the way stipends are determined for USG members at the Senate meeting on Tuesday. 
The stipend is the compensation students receive for serving as an elected or appointed USG official. Under Title X, all USG officials are currently paid by a predetermined stipend that is specific to their position. Oh and Vidalon-Suzuki proposed to pay all USG officials by an hourly rate, determined by the minimum wage of Los Angeles County. In 2018, minimum wage is expected to increase to $13.25 per hour. 
According to Oh and Vidalon-Suzuki, the proposal is part of an effort to make USG more accessible to students, especially those who cannot afford to take an unpaid position or a position that is not at least minimum wage. 
“Right now, USG boasts about being diverse and being accessible to students, but it clearly isn’t,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. 
While next year’s administration has complete discretion over how to allocate funds if the new stipend system is passed, USG Vice President Austin Dunn stressed that a joint effort between the current administration and next year’s administration will be vital to its success. 
The cost of the new stipend program will fluctuate per year, depending on the number of USG members elected. However, Vidalon-Suzuki estimated that the program will call for $54,489 more than the current budget. If the new stipend system is passed, the USG President’s salary will decrease by about $2,000, and the USG Vice President’s salary will decrease by about $845. 
“During the [USG] Presidential election, accessibility and having students [in USG who] reflect the student body were hot topics,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. “We think this is a perfect way to do so.”
The proposal will be voted on at next week’s USG meeting.
