The unranked USC men’s volleyball team secured a 3-1 victory over No. 3 UC Irvine Wednesday at the Galen Center. Senior Jack Wyett led the team with 19 kills and 10 digs while seniors Ryan Moss and Gianluca Grasso added 16 and 14 kills, respectively.
The 5-2 Trojans started off hot, leading throughout the first set for a 25-19 final. The Anteaters shifted the momentum in the second set, scoring the first 5 points, but USC fired back with 5 consecutive points of its own to claim a 25-21 finish. The teams traded leads in the third set until UCI closed the deal with the final 4 points for a 21-25 set. The final set was close until the Trojans steadily pulled ahead for a 25-18 set to claim the victory. 
Next, the Trojans will take on defending national champion Long Beach State Friday. 
Although USC holds a 61-52 lead in its series with top-ranked Long Beach State, the team has lost in their last three meetings. The Men of Troy will face the Long Beach State 49ers once more in March for regular season play.
Long Beach is off to a 6-0 start in the 2019 season, sweeping every opponent they’ve faced in Grand Canyon, Concordia Irvine, Harvard, Mount Olive, Barton and UCLA. 
Senior outside hitter TJ DeFalco will be a player to watch, leading the 49ers with 65 kills. Senior setter Josh Tuaniga is leading the nation with 202 assists and an average of 11.73 per set. Tuaniga is also the reigning National Player of the Year. Senior libero Jordan Molina leads the defense with 36 digs on the season. 
After back-to-back road trips the past two weekends, the Trojans will focus on mental preparation for this match, refusing to allow fatigue to get the better of them. 
“We’ve kind of been trying to take our minds off of volleyball a little bit, just because we’ve done so much of it recently,” Wyett said. “We’ve definitely had a lot of schoolwork to catch up on too.”
Playing against the top-ranked team,  the Trojans will benefit from that mental preparation, which will block out any nerves. 
“You kind of have to get used to it because it’s a lot of that throughout the season,” Wyett said. 
The Trojans have already taken on two top-5 opponents this season, falling 0-3 to then-No. 4 Hawaii, and upsetting No. 3 UC Irvine on Wednesday. 
“Our passing has been pretty good, but serving and blocking is something we can work on,” Wyett said.
Beyond that, focusing on what they’re doing in practice and implementing it into the game will be the Trojans’ main strategy against Long Beach State.
“[It’s good] knowing that the worst thing that happens is you have a bad game, and then the next night you can have a good game,” Wyett said. “So it’s just knowing that at end of the day it’s just a sport and you’re there having fun with it. We’ve done it a thousand times so it’s not anything we’re not prepared for.”
USC will take on Long Beach State Jan. 25 at 7 p.m. at Walter Pyramid for Long Beach State’s 2019 season home opener. The 49ers will raise their National Championship banner, the team’s first since 1991, during a brief ceremony before the game.

Coming into the season, the USC women’s basketball team was projected as one of the top teams in the Pac-12, after they finished 20-11 overall and 9-9 in conference play last year. The Women of Troy started off the season living up to expectations by winning ten out of their first eleven games, only to lose five straight matchups to start conference play. In what seemed to be a lost season, the Trojans are looking to turn things around after beating crosstown rival UCLA.
After already losing to the Bruins earlier this season, the Trojans came into Saturday’s game with a chip on their shoulder. With great performances all around, the Trojans managed to pull off their first conference win in a 72-67 victory to extend their overall record to 11-6.
The Trojans have a quick turnaround this week as they prepare to play the Arizona Wildcats and the No. 16 Arizona State Sun Devils over a three-day span.
The Wildcats will look to even their conference record when they host USC, while the Sun Devils aim to extend their recent success after upsetting No. 9 Oregon State in a double-time thriller on Jan. 20. If the Trojans hope to beat both these teams, they will have to rely on senior guard Aliyah Mazyck and junior guard Minyon Moore to repeat their successes from Saturday.
Moore was on fire in her last five games,, averaging 39.4 minutes played, 14 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. Against the Bruins, Moore had one of her best games, playing all 40 minutes and finishing with a double-double.
“Our kids practice hard,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “That’s why you win games. Kids talk, and you get after it and you just have to keep competing so hopefully we can keep it going.”
Mazyck had her breakout game last week against the Bruins, scoring 26 points and shooting 100 percent from the free throw line in all 40 minutes of play. In her senior year, the Trojans hope that Mazyck can repeat her success from previous seasons to lead the team to their first NCAA tournament appearance since the 2013-2014 season.
“This was my last USC-UCLA game,” Mazyck said. “Our pride was on the line. It’s hard to be positive when you’ve been losing, but we stayed positive and got positive results.”
The Wildcats and the Sun Devils are currently No. 7 and No. 5 in the Pac-12 standings, respectively. Even though the teams have not been playing at the level they were hoping to coming into this season, they are both eight games above .500.
Against the Wildcats, the Trojans will have to pay attention to redshirt sophomore guard Aari McDonald, Arizona’s star player. In 18 games this season, McDonald has had a total of 449 points, 113 rebounds, and 45 steals. She is a force to reckoned with on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball.
As for the Sun Devils, they bring in key freshman guard Iris Mbulito. Also playing 18 games this season, Mbulito leads all Arizona State players in points, free throw percentage, and steals, with 265, .838, and 25, respectively. 
“If we play like this the rest of the way, we’ll be very competitive,” Trakh said following the UCLA game.
The Women of Troy hope to win two more conference games this weekend when they travel to Arizona to take on the Wildcats this Friday at 6 p.m. and the Sun Devils this Sunday at 12 p.m.

USC men’s basketball defeated Arizona 80-57 at home Thursday. The victory was highlighted by overpowering first-half play and the return of freshman guard Kevin Porter Jr. 
The Trojans took a commanding 16-7 lead, forcing Arizona to regroup and use a timeout. Afterward, USC brought in Porter, who had missed the team’s previous two games due to a suspension. He hit a 3-pointer at the first opportunity, clearly energized to be back. Porter would go on to miss two dunks and commit two fouls, although his presence was welcomed.
“[Porter] came in and played within the flow of the offense,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He fit in perfectly.”
Junior forward Nick Rakocevic led the offensive charge in the opening minutes with 6 straight points. He demonstrated effective movement of the ball by cutting past Arizona senior center Ryan Luther for uncontested layups. Even when guarded, Rakocevic used his long wingspan to lay it in at the block.
Junior guard Jonah Mathews made a strong effort on the defensive side with a steal and subsequent 3-point play early on. In Arizona’s next run, he deflected a Wildcat pass to force a scoreless possession. Arizona would continue to turn the ball over and give USC more opportunities to extend their lead.
USC had offensive contributions throughout the night from many different sources, including star senior forward and captain Bennie Boatwright. Rakocevic continued to capitalize on the size mismatch that was presented to him and racked up 12 points on 6-7 shooting. With six minutes left in the first half, the Trojans held a commanding 29-15 lead.
Arizona’s offensive struggles continued as USC played lockdown defense. The Wildcats were unable to penetrate and continued to shoot threes that wouldn’t fall. USC took a commanding 36-19 lead at the end of the first half after junior guard Derryck Thornton hit a buzzer-beating 3-point shot.
“It all starts with defense,” Rakocevic said. “If we get some stops, that allows us to create offensively.”
Rakocevic continued to play the mismatch to his advantage, making 4 points in the opening minutes of the second half. Senior guard Shaqquan Aaron’s presence was felt as well. He grabbed two offensive rebounds and finished a short-range shot with strong displays of hustle. The Trojans continued to dominate the game four minutes into the second half, with Boatwright completing a double-double on an uncontested three.
The Wildcats attempted to come back, but Porter hit two more threes to eliminate any chance of a momentum shift. The daunting score deficit remained with the Trojans ahead in the final 10 minutes of the second half, 53-33.
The remainder of the second half was highlighted by excellent shooting and stellar defense by the Trojans. USC held Arizona to a mere 27.8 percent shooting overall and 20 percent 3-point shooting.
“We played 40 minutes of zone,” Enfield said. “Our players were rotating, helping and sliding out to the 3-point line to challenge shots.”
Rakocevic ended the game with an efficient double-double of 27 points and 12 rebounds. Porter impressed in his return as well, scoring 14 points. As a whole, the team contributed to a 50 percent shooting percentage from beyond the arc.
The Trojans will look to carry their strong play into another home game against Arizona State this Saturday at 5 p.m.

Thank God I write this column on a weekly basis. It gives me the opportunity to write about each installment of the USC football tailspin.
Over the past few days, there have been a lot of rumors that early enrollee five-star wide receiver Bru McCoy is considering transferring to Texas. Yesterday, McCoy entered the College Football Transfer Portal, meaning that he is open to being recruited by other schools (namely Texas). These rumors share an eerily similar plausibility with the Kliff Kingsbury rumors two weeks ago. 
It is pretty hard to believe that McCoy’s considerations aren’t based upon the loss of offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. Five-star receivers want to go to a university to do a few things: win football games, get better under great coaches and get noticed by professional scouts. Right now, USC offers only one of those three things and it isn’t the first two. Hell, it’s almost February and USC still doesn’t have an offensive coordinator.
My gut tells me that this is a done deal. If someone had committed to USC, signed a letter of intent and enrolled early at the University in any other of the past few years, they were all in. Every recruit knew what he was getting himself into: a winning football program with elite coaches that would provide the opportunity to be noticed by NFL scouts. I don’t blame McCoy for having one foot out the door because, right now, it sure looks like he’s stepping away from a sinking ship.
For the sake of simplicity, let’s consider that McCoy does take a one-way trip from Los Angeles to Austin. There are a couple ways to look at this decision and how it will affect USC.  
Most fans would agree that the loss of one wide receiver won’t affect USC. Granted, fans will be disappointed that USC failed to retain a five-star recruit, but wide receiver is pretty much the only position that is solid for the Trojans in 2019. 
Going into next season, USC will retain a strong core of veteran wide receivers in junior Michael Pittman and redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns. Both wide receivers had solid 2018 performances, with Pittman posting an average of 69 yards per game and Vaughns notching 56 in the same category.
The Trojans will also bring back some young talent. Rising sophomores Amon-Ra St. Brown and Devon Williams both showed potential last season. St. Brown was a consistent starter for the Trojans, despite a bumpy season. A year of collegiate football under his belt should help iron out some of those inconsistencies. Although Williams didn’t enjoy as much playing time as St. Brown, his performance against Oregon State should not be overlooked. The freshman boasted 77 yards on three receptions with a touchdown.
At the receiving level, USC is doing swell. The Trojans have always been able to attract great potential at that position. 
That brings me to my next take on the McCoy situation. 
McCoy’s departure won’t hurt the 2019 Trojans or the 2020 roster, but barring another losing season from USC, it will set the precedent that USC is no longer a powerhouse and no longer has the ability to attract five-star talent. 
Some sites have McCoy listed as the only five-star prospect in USC’s 2019 recruiting class, while others also have Kyle Ford, a hard commit wide receiver, as USC’s second five-star. But if McCoy decides to jump ship after enrolling at USC, what’s to stop Ford from following suit and getting a couple’s discount on a one-way flight out of Los Angeles?
The Trojans haven’t had back-to-back losing seasons since 1961. Back then, the Trojans were in the Athletic Association of Western Universities and were led out of the tunnel by John McKay. 
This team doesn’t do losing. This fanbase doesn’t do losing. These recruits do not want to lose. That’s why the Coliseum is half empty. That’s why alumni are pissed off at USC Athletics. And that’s why the recruits keep leaving.

The United Teachers of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District reached a settlement Tuesday, after nearly a full day of negotiation, ending a two-year-long contract dispute and a weeklong strike. The new contract has secured many of the demands made by Los Angeles public school teachers. It will gradually reduce class sizes by a rate of one student a year for two years and then two students in the third year. It will also allow schools to hire more full-time support staff. These benefits not only outweigh the short-term costs of a strike but also facilitate public schools’ capacities to prepare students for college.
It is true that the strike’s timing impacted the college applications process for many LAUSD students.  The majority of college application deadlines, however, had already passed by the time the strike began; the initial deadline for California State Universities and Universities of California was Nov. 30. Though receiving guidance on the USC application, which was due during the strike, was nearly impossible without the ability to consult teachers or counselors, last-minute revisions hardly improve an applicant’s qualifications. 
Complications caused by the LAUSD strike, while incredibly inconvenient, are highly unlikely to make or break a college application. Additionally, USC Admission announced that students with late recommendation letters or transcripts would not be penalized, so long as their application was sent in on time.
The institutional barriers addressed by the strike have a far greater impact on a student’s admission prospects. Class size alone is significant, as it determines the amount of individual attention each student receives. Los Angeles science teacher Michele Levin told NPR last week that the benefits of smaller classes meant she would be able to return parents’ phone calls and grade fewer papers each night.
When teachers are responsible for fewer students, they are more likely to deliver thorough feedback, increase student participation and communicate regularly with students and their parents. This results in an enhanced learning experience that grants students the academic momentum necessary to thrive at the college level. This is a much-needed benefit; on average, only 20 percent high school students meet LAUSD’s college readiness standards in English Language Arts and only 7 percent meet standards in Mathematics.
Smaller class sizes are especially necessary given the demographics of the district. The Tennessee Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio experiment, the most influential study on class size reduction, found that “minority and low-income students show even greater gains when placed in small classes in the primary grades.” Given that over 90 percent of LAUSD students are racial minorities and 84 percent qualify for free or reduced lunch, the contract settlement’s new class sizes are a promising step forward.
Most importantly, the new contract staggers the decreases in class-size caps over a period of three years, preventing the pitfalls that accompany immediate change. Reducing class sizes naturally requires schools to hire more teachers. If demand for teachers becomes too high, LAUSD would be forced to rely on inexperienced hires, who often lack certification and postgraduate education. A gradual plan allows prospective teachers more time to receive adequate qualifications and training, increasing the likelihood that LAUSD students receive competent instruction.
Another benefit of the new contract is increased support staff, such as nurses, counselors and psychologists. According to a LAUSD News release, the district pledged to hire 300 more full-time nurses and 77 more middle and high school counselors over the next two years, meeting UTLA demands for a “full-time nurse at every school five days a week.”
Under the new contract, teachers will no longer be the only ones available to help students with broken bones, fevers or other health issues well beyond their expertise. It is impossible to effectively cover content and provide medical aid simultaneously, and providing qualified medical assistance not only ensures that student health needs are being met but also allows teachers to devote their full efforts to teaching.
The new contract’s provisions promise to facilitate effective instruction, whether through lowering class sizes or by providing support staff. However, these commitments are tentative and dependent on LAUSD receiving new funding, whether it be through a parcel tax or increased state or federal funding. It is incumbent on California voters to show up and vote for these measures to ensure that LAUSD students continue to have a fighting chance at accessing higher education.

Interim President Wanda Austin sent a memorandum Tuesday updating the USC community on the creation of the President’s Culture Commission, which intends to improve  the campus environment.
While the selected faculty and staff members do represent a diversity of disciplines and specialties, ranging from computer science to Middle East studies, there are only two students on the commission: Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee and Graduate Student Government President Joycelyn Yip. While the inclusion of these two student leaders is critical, the lack of further student representation on the committee seems ill-advised and counterproductive.
Allowing more students to participate in the commission could bring about more open forum discussions about the University’s culture and show minority groups on campus that their voices are valued by the University.
Just as the Culture Commission currently lacks student representation, the Presidential Search Advisory Committee has been plagued by similar problems. The Daily Trojan reported in September that during one of the search committee’s listening sessions, participants like USG presidential candidate Michaela Murphy were outraged by the lack of student voices. Including more students in the Culture Commission seems advisable when a similar committee was highly criticized for excluding them.
Unlike most faculty and staff, who leave campus at night and on weekends, students spend almost all of their time on or around campus. University culture has a major impact on most students’ lives and, these students, who are constantly immersed in USC’s culture, would best know how to most effectively address campus problems. Involving representatives from prominent student organizations in the process would ensure students, especially those from minority groups, receive adequate representation.
For example, the Culture Commission has no representation from students in Greek life, yet the University has taken steps in the past few years to curb their operations, by deferring rush by a semester for new students among other decisions. At a school where 22 percent of students participate in some form of Greek life and even more attend fraternity parties on the weekends, ignoring the voice of these students is a drastic oversight. These groups heavily influence the culture at USC, not only with regard to the party scene but also in students’ social lives. They must be included in the conversation.
In addition, the University should also include groups that serve students of color and LGBTQ populations in the Culture Commission’s discussions. These groups make up an important part of the student population, and engaging with them can help show that the University is willing and able to listen to and work with student leaders. Their concerns deserve to be heard, especially when the University touts diversity and inclusion in their marketing materials. 
In the wake of numerous scandals,  increased student representation on the Culture Commission would reaffirm the University’s commitment to providing a safe culture that supports its students and values their opinions. This would assure students that the University is committed to creating a culture that is not only beneficial to faculty and staff but also to students.

Following its six-win opening weekend at the Gaucho Invitational, the USC women’s water polo team will travel to Riverside Saturday to compete against Concordia and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps at the CBU Mini Invitational.
The Eagles’ and the Athenas’, matches against USC will be both teams’ first of the season. As Claremont-Mudd-Scripps belongs to the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which is part of NCAA’s Division III, Saturday’s match will be the program’s first against the Trojans. The Athenas’ record last season was 18-10 overall, although they fared well against SCIAC opponents, boasting an 11-3 conference record.
A member of the Golden Coast Conference, Concordia regularly faces tough competition, including No. 7 Pacific and No. 15 Loyola Marymount. The Eagles have struggled to find success in such a talented conference, evidenced by their 0-7 conference record last season. The last time USC faced Concordia was two years ago, when the Trojans dominated the Eagles 28-1.
Junior attacker Hanna Jordan will play a key role for the Eagles in countering the hot Trojan offense this Saturday. Jordan is an all-around threat; after only two seasons, she ranks among Concordia’s top 10 all-time lists in goals scored (56), steals (26) and assists (13).
Despite Concordia’s talented scorers, offensive pressure has been hard to come by against the Trojans so far this season. On top of that, the Trojans’ potent offense threatens to outscore opponents even if its defense is struggling. Though Cal Baptist was able to score 5 goals on the Trojan defense last weekend, USC scored a whopping 25 times to overwhelm the Lancers. In fact, the Trojans are conceding an average of just 4.75 goals per game, while their offense puts up 16 goals on average. 
“Offensively we’ve been able to score quite a bit in every game,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “I think offensively, we are a very, very dangerous team, and I hope that continues.”
The Trojans’ success on both ends of the pool may be attributed to the team’s well-rounded approach to practice.
“You have to focus on a little bit of everything [in practice],” Vavic said. “Half-court defense, down-a-man defense, transition defense, center plays, how to attack the opponent’s defenses and verifying how we execute in extra man situations and fast breaks.”
USC has also focused on integrating new players into the team, especially those who began practice as recently as Dec. 27. Freshmen 2-meters Tilly Kearns and Mireia Guiral, from Australia and Spain respectively, seem to be adjusting well to the team dynamic: Each delivered multiple-goal performances for the Trojans last weekend. Facing weaker opponents early on in the season should allow these young players to familiarize themselves with the team and develop their skills.
“It’s been good,” Vavic said of integrating new players. “Mireia and [Alejandra Aznar], our two Spanish girls, are very experienced … so they are learning our system very fast. Tilly is a quick learner, and our other freshmen are learning. They’re getting the grasp of things.”
Although the Trojans boasted a 12.8-goal margin of victory on average in their first six games this season and face two opponents this weekend who struggle against ranked foes, Vavic emphasizes that they put in the effort up to the final whistle.
“It’s really one play at a time,” Vavic said. “I don’t think our players think so much about the score as [much as] executing the next offensive or defensive play and really getting better.”
The weekend’s non-conference play begins against Concordia at 12:45 p.m. Saturday. Immediately following that game the Trojans will reenter the pool to face Claremont-Mudd-Scripps at 2 p.m.

The men’s volleyball team recorded two victories and one loss last weekend at the Off The Block Grow The Game Challenge in Lebanon, Tenn, bringing their overall record to 4-2. 
On Friday, outside hitters senior Ryan Moss and redshirt senior captain Jack Wyett combined for 24 kills to lead the Trojans to a 3-0 win over the Lincoln Memorial Railsplitters.
Moss and Wyett led the Trojans on defense as well, each with five digs in the match. Moss, junior middle blocker Vecas Lewin and redshirt junior middle blocker Tyler Resnick each supplied 4 blocks as well to secure the win. 
USC took the first set easily by the score of 25-22. The Railsplitters took an 18-10 lead in the second set, but USC snagged the next 7 points en route to a 25-20 victory. At the end of the third set, the Railsplitters had a two-point lead, but once again the Trojans finished strong, scoring 4 points to win the match 25-23. 
The Trojans fell to Barton College 3-1 in the second round of the tournament on Saturday. Bulldogs junior right sider Angelos Mandilaris and senior outside hitter Vasilis Mandilaris had 15 kills each to lead Barton offensively in their victory over the Trojans. 
Moss, Wyett and senior co-captain Gianluca Grasso led USC with 19, 17 and 9 kills, respectively.
USC managed a 24-23 lead in the first set, but Barton closed in on the Trojans scoring the final 3 points to secure the frame. The Bulldogs and the Trojans traded leads in the second set until USC dominated for a 25-21 final. Barton then maintained a lead throughout the third set for a 25-17 finish. The Bulldogs secured the match as USC gave up a 24-22 lead in the fourth set for a final score of 26-24. 
“There were a couple times where we let the fatigue get to us,” Wyett said. “When we lost to Barton, we were definitely pretty tired and we kind of underestimated them going into the match. Looking back we definitely know we had the talent to beat them but we weren’t mentally prepared for that game.”
Wyett and Moss lead the Trojans to a 3-0 victory over Lindenwood on Sunday with 19 and 11 kills respectively. Senior libero Matt Douglas led the Trojan defense six digs, while Grasso and sophomore setter Chris Hall each had five. 
The score stayed close in both the first and second sets until the Trojans pulled through at the end for final scores of 25-20 and 25-21. Lindenwood ramped it up in the third set, managing a 20-18 lead before the Trojans tied it again. The Lions and the Trojans traded points until USC pulled ahead for a 32-30 victory. 
This was the second road trip in a row for the Trojans, having played in the Hawaiian Airlines Rainbow Warrior Classic two weekends ago. Back to back road trips meant inevitable fatigue for the Trojans. 
“We were definitely tired, so having a good second string, that definitely helps us,” Wyett said. “Knowing that we’re going to have to do this throughout the season, being mentally and physically prepared is key,” he added. 
This Friday, the Trojans will travel to play the defending national champion, Long Beach State, at 7:00pm in Walter Pyramid.

As we head into Super Bowl mania, it’s hard to escape football in any aspect of life. Especially here in Los Angeles, where fans are enjoying the city’s first Super Bowl in decades only a few years after the Rams’ relocation. It seems like L.A. might just become a football city after all.
But a separate story about the state of football has been brewing quietly on the sidelines, in the background of the past week’s show-stopping finishes and referee debates. Last week, an ESPN investigation revealed that the NFL is struggling to insure its players. 
Only one insurance company — a subsidiary of American International Group — will continue to work with the NFL anymore, due to the massive demands of workers’ compensation in a sport that guarantees regular injuries. Due to its lack of options, the league is now at the mercy of this company, and can no longer offer general liability insurance that will cover neurological damage for its athletes. This means that an NFL player who is sidelined with a traumatic brain injury will not receive any type of insurance as he recovers.
This stark reality reflects the practical, business-minded underbelly of this crisis — concussions are just too damn expensive. As the insurance and legal industries continue to come to grips with this realization, football will begin to see the effects.
Since the concussion conversation became mainstream, the main question gripping fans of the game has revolved around its timeline: How long does the sport have left? There are small ripples throughout the NFL, with a player or two leaving the sport to avoid brain trauma each year, and there are even larger effects at the youth level, where a pivot towards touch and flag football has been emphasized with hopes of preserving the game. 
But the idea that football could actually just disappear seems outlandish and outrageous. College and professional football are mainstays of the American economy and lifestyle. Too many people wear jerseys, buy tickets and plan their weekends around their teams, right? Concussions are a frightening, gruesome challenge, but it simply doesn’t seem as if anything is quite big enough to topple America’s game.
That’s true, to a degree. No moral indignation will ever be strong enough to upend football — not over race or sexism, domestic violence or head trauma. As much as I, or any sportswriter, might belabor the point, there’s always the understanding that enough will never be enough. It won’t even matter if — or, more likely, when — a player is paralyzed or killed on the field. Football will continue to march on, unencumbered by moral dilemma.
But football can’t march on without insurance. This raises an argument that isn’t moral, but rather pragmatic. As concussions worsen, insurance will get more and more costly, and at a point, it will become completely impractical for any company to insure players. Why insure a franchise when every single one of its employees is guaranteed to sustain a life-altering brain injury? Why buy in when the risks are well-known, accepted and inevitable?
It’s been widely accepted that football will fall at the youth level before it will diminish at the upper levels, where it has become a major industry. When it comes to this insurance dilemma, this pattern will certainly follow. 
Rising insurance premiums are already threatening the viability of programs at the youth, high school and even community college levels. Last year, the Maricopa County Community Colleges in Arizona completely cut their football programs because their insurance plans and overall liability were simply too expensive for the schools to justify keeping the program. 
Only two days after Los Angeles teachers finalized a deal to end a week-long strike for higher wages, it’s hard to imagine how public school districts will continue to rationalize the soaring costs of insuring their athletes while continuing to struggle to pay educators. Although the idea of high school in America without football might sound foreign, it could become a foregone conclusion as schools struggle to balance their budgets.
And a decrease in the youth pipeline would spark the slow demise of football that many have predicted. Fewer players at the youth and high school levels will mean a smaller pool of both players and fans, as both athletic and non-athletic children are raised on basketball and baseball over the years rather than football. With fewer kids playing, fewer athletes and superfans will be bred, leaving the NFL weakened in the shadow of the already-booming NBA.
The concussion conversation will inevitably spell the end of football as the powerhouse of American sports, and it deserves a place in every aspect of football, including the festivities of Super Bowl weekend. But when looking toward the eventual downfall of the sport, it’s becoming increasingly naive to predict that purely emotional arguments will drive this demise. Instead, just follow the money — that’s what runs, and will ultimately end, the industry of football.

Both the men’s and women’s track and field seasons started off with a bang at last weekend’s Martin Luther King Jr. Invitational in Albuquerque, N.M. The Trojans won a total of 13 events across the two-day meet, with impressive performances across the board. The invitational saw strong showings from both old faces and newcomers alike, a promising sign for the Trojans’ season.
USC racked up six victories on the first day of competition. Sophomore jumper Earnest Sears finished in first place in the high jump with a clearance of 7 feet 5.25 inches — a feat he managed on his first attempt at that height. That jump was Sears’ personal record and good for third on USC’s all-time leaderboard, behind only redshirt senior jumper Randall Cunningham and former star Jesse Williams. 
Later in the day, the Trojans secured another victory with senior jumper Margaux Jones, who returned from an injury-plagued 2018 campaign. Jones won the women’s long jump with a leap of 19-11.00. 
USC also captured first place finishes in both the men’s and women’s 600-meter race, even though USC athletes generally don’t compete in the event. Junior distance runner Isaiah Jewett, a transfer from UC Irvine, secured a win for USC in the men’s 600 in his first race as a Trojan, with a time of 1:15.95. Another newcomer gave the Trojans a first place finish in the women’s 600: freshman distance runner Jemima Russell’s time of 1:29.25 was good for a win as well. 
Redshirt junior Nathan Bultman picked up another first place finish for the Trojans in the weight throw, setting a personal record with his winning toss of 67 feet 8 inches. Sophomore runner TeeTee Terry, looking to build off of a tremendous freshman year, impressed in a big way as she won the women’s 200 dash with a time of 23.31 seconds. Look for her to become one of the Trojans’ biggest names in track going forward this season.
On Saturday, the Trojans topped Friday’s win total with seven victories. Terry continued her dominance on the second day, running a 7.22 to win the women’s 60-meter dash. On the heels of Russell’s victory the previous day, another freshman, hurdler Ayden Owens, won his first event as a Trojan (the 60-meter hurdles) with a time of 7.94 seconds. The Trojans captured a victory in the women’s 60 hurdles as well — sophomore Chanel Brissett’s time of 8.07 earned her a personal record. 
USC also swept both 400-meter races, with sophomore hurdler Cameron Samuel running a personal record 47.94 to win the men’s event and sophomore sprinter Kaelin Roberts running a 52.54 to win the women’s. Redshirt junior thrower and co-captain Matthew Katnik, coming off of a strong 2018 season, won his first event of the year in the men’s shot put.
The final USC victory of the invitational came from the women’s 4×400 relay team, comprising freshmen Bailey Lear, Lanae-Tava Thomas and Alyssa Brewer, and junior Kyra Constantine, who won their race with a time of 3:40.90. 
With a near-ideal start to the season now in their back pocket, the Trojans will set their sights on the Texas Tech Invitational in Lubbock this Friday and Saturday. They’ll compete against stronger competition than they faced in last week’s meet, with multiple Big-12 schools set to attend. The Trojans’ performance at the meet will deliver a clearer picture of what to expect from this squad for the remainder of the season.

The LA Art Show is back with hundreds of innovative exhibitors displaying thousands of provocative pieces from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27. Founded in 1995, the LA Art Show has grown into one of the most diverse international contemporary art shows. Taking place at the Los Angeles Convention Center, the art show has over 20,000 square feet of space dedicated to it, making it the largest art fair on the West Coast. 
This year, the LA Art Show will feature 120 galleries, each with its own unique theme ranging from contemporary and modern art, ink paintings, historical pieces, pop art and photography. The show floor also features the work of local and international artists alike. Aside from pieces available for purchase, the programming will include performances and exhibitions throughout the week. Recent years have seen an uptick in attendance and a growing collection of artwork. This year seems to follow that trend. 
Australian Aboriginal artist Gabriella Possum Nungurrayi is showcasing “Grandmother’s Country,” a work based on the spiritual stories of native Australia. Danish artist Mads Christensen’s “Certain Angles” uses light to immerse viewers in a unique visual experience. French artist Emmanuel Boos is bringing in a mesmerizing solid block monolith that captures his unpredictable yet systematic approach to artwork. And Korean digital artist Lee Lee Nam’s reinterpretations of classic European and Asian works will challenge viewers’ perceptions of traditional art.  
 L.A.-based graffiti artist RISK is making his debut at the LA Art Show with two sculptures from his ongoing series, “Shark.” These provocative pieces comment on the different forms that predators take and are used to comment on police predation by drawing on the Buddhist tradition of “embracing what you fear.” One of the pieces is his controversial sculpture of a bisected police cruiser, while the other is a shark made of machine parts. 
Renowned L.A. native Mike Stilkey is bringing his original artwork, which uses the one side of a pile of books as the canvas for his own vision. His pieces generally create whimsical characters that exude emotional depth and wondrous mystery as they grace enormous mounds of novels.  His poem, “The Lady of Arlington,” is on display at the show this week, presented by bG Gallery. 
Considering this year’s catalogue of exhibitions, the show is shaping up to be a big week for art and conversation in L.A. Tickets for a single day are $30, while a four-day pass starts at $60 with part of the proceeds going to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital.

On Jan. 2 last year, my friend Blaze Bernstein was murdered by a member of the Neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen. 
I repeat this sentence to myself sometimes, as if by saying it more, it becomes easier to accept. 
On Jan. 2nd last year, my friend Blaze Bernstein was murdered by a member of the Neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen. The murderer was a former classmate. I knew them both.
Or, maybe, I repeat this sentence to myself in an attempt to remember Blaze longer. In the weeks following his death, I dug up every photo, gift card and short story that I had from him. I stared at them all. I hugged them tight to my chest. I tried to remember every bit about him, every detail, like the smell of his deodorant and the sound of his laugh. 
But of all the details I remember about Blaze, my food memories are the most salient.
Every day senior year, Blaze would unsheath his lunch from his backpack and eat it in the middle of our writing classes. Sometimes, it would be six perfect gyoza arranged in a tupperware container and a tiny bottle filled with soy sauce. Other times, it was a tamal sitting in its corn husk or a Trader Joe’s salad that I would pick the beets off of. He had a near-obsession with Trader Joe’s products, and would make the long trek to the nearest store in a neighboring city each week to stock up on lunch items.  
He often brought his home creations to school for us to eat. I remember the day he brought in a chocolate-dipped cranberry biscotti that I could not stop eating. Another time, it was macaroni and cheese with just a hint of Dijon mustard to balance the flavors. It was clear that he had been watching and reading about food just as long as I had been, if not longer. Our conversations were peppered with references to “The Great British Bake Off,” “Barefoot Contessa” and, of course, Guy Fieri. 
The food comedy extended beyond the simple Flavortown memes and deep into Blaze’s personality. One of his best jokes revolved around an imaginary Italian dish, “strombini,” that he would insist was real. Blaze fabricated a recipe and presented it to nonbelievers, even posting it on a Facebook page called “Italian Christmas Recipes.” Another running bit referenced the suggestive nature of a turkey baster, which evolved into us having a Friendsgiving centered on a communal basting of the turkey. 
On Jan. 2 last year, my friend Blaze Bernstein was murdered by a member of the Neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen. 
From sharing a disgusting chimichanga at Disneyland to searching through the empty hallways of The Westin Bonaventure for food during a school trip, my memories of eating with Blaze are expansive. I remember him forcing me to drink more water at a local bagel shop after I had overheated on a hike, concerned for my well-being. I remember him eating orange and black cupcakes with me after nobody showed up to my Halloween party sophomore year. But mostly, I remember his endless enthusiasm for food, something he and I shared.
It doesn’t surprise me to that our love of food and writing brought us both to food writing. Before he died, Blaze wrote for the University of Pennsylvania’s food magazine, Penn Appétit. 
On Jan. 2 last year, my friend Blaze Bernstein was murdered by a member of the Neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen. I knew them both. My food memories with his murderer are slim and unremarkable, nothing more than a greasy slice of pizza or a stale donut eaten on the tennis court during P.E. He wore a bullet on a chain around his neck and spoke very little, probably stifling the overwhelming amount of hatred and rage contained in his body. 
The last time I ever saw Blaze was over FaceTime The conversation was composed mostly of his complaints about an intricate tofu dish he photographed for Penn Appétit, which took several hours to make. At the end of our call, he sent me a picture of the final product — two arching semicircles, one of crisp tofu and sprigs of parsley, the other a dark brown sauce, perfectly arranged on a blue plate. It stared at me like it had been plucked from a Michelin-star restaurant and it wasn’t far off. 
Blaze had the exacting personality and creative spirit of a masterful chef and had, he continued to live, he would probably scrutinize every word in my columns. When I write, I think about his writing, his editing, his enthusiasm. While I can’t write down every memory of him, part of each piece is always dedicated to his memory.
I hope he likes them.

USC will no longer recognize Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity  after an investigation found that the organization violated hazing regulations. 
“Hazing is a violation of our university’s community standards and is a threat to student health and well-being,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Pi Kappa Phi declined to comment specifically on the loss of recognition, which was announced to the fraternity Jan. 10, according to USC. 
Pi Kappa Phi was listed as unrecognized on the Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development website in January for hazing and safety violations. The organization is no longer recognized by the national organization and cannot conduct chapter meetings, recruitment or socials, according to the website. 
“USC expects fraternities to uphold the values of their organization and USC,” the University wrote. “Membership in a fraternity is considered to be a privilege, and with this privilege comes the responsibility of acceptable conduct.” 
USC said the safety and well-being of students is the University’s top priority and hazing is not tolerated on campus.
“The University will not tolerate behavior that put students in jeopardy and is inconsistent with our values,” USC wrote. 
The Interfraternity Council did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Researchers from the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at the Keck School of Medicine published a groundbreaking paper that highlights the underlying causes of Alzheimer’s disease and reveals a potential treatment for it and other similar brain conditions. 
The research, a five-year-long study with more than 150 patients in clinical trials, has successfully identified the blood brain barrier as the root of the disease, which affects an estimated 5.7 million Americans. 
Institute Director Berislav Zlokovic,  the primary investigator and author of the study, partnered with the Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute to conduct the research.
“Our recent paper is about the blood brain barrier breakdown,” Zlokovic said. “If there are leaky blood vessels in the brain … then we should work to fix it … and acting on the vascular system may have important effects on delaying or even stopping cognitive decay.” 
According to Zlokovic and his researchers, as the brain and its vessels deteriorate, toxic proteins and other harmful molecules make their way into active brain tissue, damaging areas of the brain that are essential for memory.
Researchers from the institute conducted the study in collaboration with neurologists from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Huntington Medical Research Institutes in Pasadena. Each research organization was responsible for bringing in the trial’s clinical patients and collecting the resources and data the USC team used to inform its findings.
“We collect blood, spinal fluid and urine to try and look for … what people like to call biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Michael Harrington, a director of neuroscience and research at HMRI.  “Our focus is to look at these groups [of patients], whether they’re cognitively healthy, impaired or demented and … look for biomarkers that will detect the disorder and also reveal the mechanism behind it.” 
The findings, which were published in the Jan. 14 issue of Nature Medicine, can potentially help with early Alzheimer’s diagnoses and new drug development. Since the study’s publication, the neurologists are planning to expand their research to include more patients.
“Under our program right now, we have close to 700 patients,” Zlokovic said. “The objective of the study is to know the predictive value of vascular changes in the blood brain barrier in predicting cognitive decline in people who have Alzheimer’s disease. After that … we will expand this to other genetic diseases like small vessel disease.” 
Alzheimer’s is only the beginning, as researchers plan to apply their work to other brain diseases. 
According to Axel Montagne, an assistant professor of research physiology and neuroscience at Keck, successful diagnoses of Alzheimer’s will lead to advances in medical technology to treat Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and, most notably, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
“We know for sure that the blood brain barrier is contributing to the evolution of each of those diseases in different ways.”  Montagne said. “If we find a cure, if we find a way to seal the blood barrier, we may be able to help cure other diseases.”

The School of Dramatic Arts is auditioning the first class of students for its new Bachelor of Fine Arts program in contemporary musical theatre, which will launch in Fall 2019. The major is a collaboration between three schools: SDA, the Thornton School of Music and the Kaufman School of Dance.
Even though the new program falls under multiple schools, SDA will be solely responsible for admissions.
“[It’s] really exciting that three schools are coming together and they are world-class in each of their disciplines,” said Kenneth Noel Mitchell, SDA’s head of musical theatre.
The major is expected to accept 14 to 16 students in its first year, but this number may change in following years. The program will feature a cohort-based, conservatory style curriculum, so students will take the same classes together throughout the program.
This year, prospective students submitted a pre-screen audition with two acting monologues, two contemporary songs and two dance videos, along with a general submission through the Common Application system. Then, a small number of students were invited to next month’s Callback Weekend, where they will audition for the program in person.
Some SDA students expressed excitement for the new major, saying they felt their peers previously had to sacrifice their passion in musical theatre to pursue another discipline.
“I have a lot of friends who are from musical theater backgrounds and felt like they had to focus in on one thing but couldn’t really study musical theatre to the best of their ability,” said Sabrina Sawyer, a junior majoring in theatre. “They had to give up that opportunity.” 
While the new program had been an idea between the schools for years, it was brought into fruition when Kenneth Noel Mitchell was hired as the head for the program. Mitchell created the curriculum for the major. 
The curriculum will focus on comprehensive, separate training in each art form for the first three semesters. Afterward, students will learn interdisciplinary in all three subjects for the remainder of their time at USC. 
“For the first year and a half, when you’re in the School of Dance, you’re learning to express yourself physically through dance; when you’re in the School of Music, you’re given the tools to sing in a healthy, expressive manner; when you’re in the School of [Dramatic Arts], you’re given the skills to act,” Mitchell said.  
The major will also allow functional training to be enriched with classes focusing on modern applications of musical theater, such as a digital entrepreneurship class or a class about on-screen musicals,  Mitchell said. 
The program arrives at a time of increased accessibility of musical theater to the public, according to Mitchell and Sawyer. Musicals are touching on current social issues, creating a sense of global connection, especially with the ease of access due to technology, Sawyer said. 
“People across cultures fall in love with music, have fallen in love with ‘Hamilton,’” Sawyer said. “Musicals in modern society do an incredible job of connecting people and bringing people into the theatre.” 
The final years of the program focus on creative growth by offering specific classes for not only performers, but also composers, lyricists, writers, directors and choreographers. The culmination of these courses will allow for the creation of original musicals by the members of the cohort. 
“We are in a new golden age of musical theatre in America,” SDA Dean David Bridel said when the major was announced in 2017 on the SDA website. “This new degree, created in partnership with our colleagues here at USC, reflects the full range of what’s possible for the art form and will develop new generations of artists fully prepared to contribute their talents and move their field forward.”
