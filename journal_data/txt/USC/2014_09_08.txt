For the past twelve years, the Strokes’ biggest competitor for title of “Most New-Yorky Band,” Interpol, have put out series of rock albums, from 2002’s masterpiece Turn On The Bright Lights to 2010’s self-titled release. Their first release grew in stature to be considered one of the defining rock albums of the modern era, while each successive release shrunk in reception — a band slowly losing its way.
But despite what Pitchfork Media might say, the band never lost their way. Despite early comparisons to Joy Division and The Cure, they’ve developed a sound completely unique to themselves: shutter-stomp drum beats, dueling guitar lines, melodic bass lines and Paul Banks’ ALL CAPS baritone. The key word for Interpol has always been interplay: the constantly moving rhythmic duels between all four instrumentalists propelled their greatest hits like “Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down” or “Evil.”
But their latest release, El Pintor (a clever anagram for the band’s name that translates to “the painter”), the band finds themselves lacking an element of their trademark groove, bassist Carlos Dengler. In many ways, Dengler’s style defined Interpol’s early work: his clean, almost disco-like bass lines buoyed numbers like “Obstacle 1.” And in an unconventional twist, Dengler became the most famous member of the band over singer Paul Banks or guitarist Daniel Kessler. His hip looks and hedonistic lifestyle attracted fan attention to “The Cult of Carlos D” — but eventually the fame wore off. In May of 2010, after the release of the band’s fourth album, Dengler announced his departure from the band with Paul Banks taking over bass duties.
Despite some fan concerns about Dengler’s departure, the band has kept its trademark sound intact while changing things up enough to keep them fresh. They announced their return in August with the single “All the Rage Back Home.” The song opens with a very spare arrangement, focusing on Banks’ voice and a high Kessler guitar line that more closely resembles bombastic fanfare than any rock riff. And then suddenly, the band cuts back into a fast-paced groove and doesn’t let go of the audience for another three minutes. And lyrically, the song resonates as one of the band’s best wrorks. All of the band’s communally written songs read like a game of two truths and a lie, a sort of cut-up style that produces more of a general emotion rather than a cohesive narrative. For example “and we went over again, my head about oh, the feeling” and “you want to leave my lady lovers of my eighteen summers alone” draw you deeper and deeper into their mysteries just for the refrain and title to remind you that no, you’re not going to get it that easily.
The rest of the album proves just as inscrutable — and thankfully, wonderful. Rather than stick too heavily to their primary style, they mix things up on a number of tracks. The second song, “Everything Is Wrong,”features a fuzzy guitar riff and falsetto vocals reminiscent of early Muse and proves to be the album’s strongest song. Album closer “Twice as Hard” opens up broadly into the closest thing to a power ballad that the band will ever release: slow, stately and with some unexpected string parts. The biggest divergence, however, occurs in the penultimate track, “Tidal Wave,” when the band whips out a whole body shaking  synthesizers and make the band’s most danceable track to date.
The band also delivers numbers in its classic style. One aspect of Turn on the Bright Lights that made the album so memorable was the song structure. The band never contents themselves with simple verse-chorus patterns. Rather, what appeared to be a conventional song at first shifts suddenly at around the three-minute mark into something almost antithetical to what preceded it: hard rock smashers like “PDA” open into pure weightlessness and mellow mood pieces like “The New” explode into massive anthems. Around half the tracks here contain this stylistic variety, like the aforementioned “All the Rage Back Home.” “Breaker 1” shifts back and forth between a brutal rock song and a mordant, almost theatrical ballad.
Despite Interpol lacking one of its founding members, El Pintor shows one of rock’s greatest modern bands returning to the sound that made them great.

Eggs are the chameleons of the culinary world. Endlessly versatile, they appear in sweet and savory dishes as main ingredients or garnishes. Their bright yellow yolks can be served runny, unctuous and oozing, or hard-boiled, thinly sliced and sprinkled with flaky salt. For college students, eggs can bind a handful of random ingredients into a cohesive dinner. An added bonus, they provide instant protein without the hassle of handling raw meat.
Yummy in my tummy! · The fast frittata for one is a perfect way to make any brunch more exciting without having to get fancy. Not only is it delicious, but it has everything necessary for a balanced meal. – Maral Tavitian| Daily Trojan
 
When you are short on time, eggs allow you to create an inspired meal effortlessly. I have compiled three of my favorite egg recipes to show you just how many forms this humble ingredient can take on. Use these ideas as an introduction to complementary flavors and textures, then begin experimenting with combinations of your own.
 
Thin Omelette Wrap 
On weekday mornings, I keep my breakfast routine simple and healthy to start the day off right. This omelette wrap is my lightened-up version of a breakfast burrito. It takes approximately five minutes to prepare and can be packaged in foil for eating on-the-go. You want to use a creamy and spreadable cheese; I like the subtle tang of goat, but ricotta, softened feta or even cream cheese would be lovely substitutes. Make sure that the pan is not too hot when you pour in the egg mixture, since the eggs cook swiftly and spread out like a crêpe. If you are in the mood for something a bit more substantial, stuff the tortilla with vegetables, canned beans, or even smoked salmon.
 
Ingredients:
• 2 large eggs
• 1 tablespoon milk or cream
• Salt and pepper to taste
• 1 whole-wheat tortilla
• 2 tablespoons goat cheese, at room temperature
• Handful salad greens
• Olive oil cooking spray
 
Total: 5 min
1.Beat the eggs, milk, salt and pepper in a bowl with a fork. Beat well, until the eggs are mostly uniform in color——-—they spread around the pan more evenly when there aren’t large patches of yolk and white. Spread goat cheese evenly over the tortilla; set aside.
2.Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Pour in the egg mixture and give it a good swirl so that it spreads out evenly across the entire pan. Cook the eggs until they are just set but still moist—30 to 45 seconds, depending on the heat of your pan. Place the tortilla, cheese-side down, over the eggs. Gently press down on the tortilla so it sticks to the eggs. Flip the wrap over and cook for an additional 30 seconds, just to warm the tortilla. Slide the tortilla onto a plate and top the eggs with a handful of greens. Roll into a wrap and serve.
Fast Frittata for One 
Since traditional frittata recipes require a fair amount of ingredients and prep time, people often reserve them for leisurely weekend brunches. My petite, personalized frittata delivers the flavor and fluffy texture of its more substantial counterpart, minus the hassle of preheating the oven. Simply sauté a few vegetables, add them to the egg mixture and cook until the eggs are just set.
For this loosely Mediterranean version, I tossed together thinly sliced mushrooms, kale, chickpeas and creamy crumbled feta. The chickpeas and kale crisp up beautifully, adding a bit of heft to an already protein-packed breakfast. Treat the recipe as a basic framework, then make adjustments using whatever ingredients suit your fancy.
 
Ingredients:
• 2 large eggs
• 1 tablespoon cream
• Salt and pepper to taste
• ¼ cup sliced white mushrooms
• ¼ cup cooked chickpeas
• ¼ cup kale, sliced in thin strands
• 1 tablespoon crumbled feta cheese
• 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided
 
Active: 5 min; total 15 min
1.Beat the eggs, cream, salt and pepper in a medium bowl with a fork. Warm one tablespoon of olive oil in a small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and chickpeas, season with salt and pepper and cook until lightly golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Add kale and sauté just until softened, about 15 seconds.
2.Add the vegetables and feta to the egg mixture. Reduce the heat to low and coat the pan with the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and cook until the edges of the frittata have set. Cover the pan with a plate and cook until the center of the frittata is set but still moist, about 2 minutes. Serve.
 
Brown Rice Bowl with Avocado and Over-Easy Eggs
The Asian-inspired combination of hearty brown rice, thinly sliced avocados, and a luxurious, perfectly fried egg is a go-to weeknight dinner. I make a big batch of rice on Sunday, then store it in the refrigerator for easy access throughout the week. While frying eggs appears simple in theory, I have gathered a couple tips to help you master this essential technique. Make sure the oil is super hot before you pour in the eggs; doing so is the key to an ethereally-crisp white. To provide insurance against punctured yolks, crack the eggs in a separate bowl then individually coax them into the pan.
 
Ingredients:
• 1 cup cooked brown rice
• ½ teaspoon red wine vinegar
• 1 scallion, thinly sliced
• 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted
• 1 teaspoon plus 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
• 2 large eggs
• ½ of an avocado, thinly sliced
• Salt and pepper to taste
• Sriracha, for serving (optional)
 
Total: 10 min
1.In a serving bowl, mix together the rice, vinegar, scallions, sesame seeds and 1 teaspoon olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Place the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Wait one minute until the oil gets very warm.
2.Crack the eggs into a small bowl then slide them individually into the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the whites are set around the edges, about 1-2 minutes. Carefully flip eggs and cook for an additional 45 seconds. Transfer the eggs and avocado to the rice and serve.

James Keogh, better known as Vance Joy, is an Australian singer-songwriter with a soulful alternative style. Following the success of his single “Riptide,” Joy will release a new album, Dream Your Life Away, on Sept. 9. “Riptide” became the top song on Triple J’s Hottest 100 countdown. Joy has sold over a million copies worldwide, has been streamed more than 3 million times a week and has cracked The Hot 100. The song launched international tours and brought the artist into the limelight. In an article by Mushroom Music Publishing Joy mentioned, “It’s taken on its own life … It’s definitely been a door opener. It’s running [its] own race now.”

While “Riptide” might have opened doors, it is Joy’s refreshing sound that keeps listeners hooked. Joy’s music has a distinctive sound and features his ukulele. His backstory and the motivation behind his songs are as diverse as his indie folk aesthetic. He started performing at open mic nights, after completing a law degree in Melbourne. His music has heartfelt origins and references books, movies and cultural icons.
Joy’s stage name  comes from Peter Carey’s novel Bliss.
“In the actual book, the character Vance Joy, he’s kind of a grandfather figure,” Joy told Radio.com. He brings people around him and tells these stories and that image just sort of fit.”
Like the character, Joy creates narratives through his music and feels a personal connection to his songs.
Though not strictly autobiographical, Joy’s music has strong ties to his own experiences. For example, “Riptide” references his fear of dentists, which he developed due to a bad experience with braces at age 14.
As a law student, Joy wrote songs and performed as a hobby; he used music purely as a form of relaxation and expression. His plans changed in 2013 when his single “Riptide” topped international music charts. Shortly after, he signed a multi-album contract with Atlantic Records and decided to pursue his passion for music instead of continuing with law. In an interview with The Bay Bridged, Joy explained that music is his passion.
“I really don’t think that I’d go with law,” he told The Bay Bridged. “If I wasn’t doing music, I’d do teaching or something else, like be a librarian.”
Luckily, Joy shows no signs of abandoning his ukulele for the book stacks. Dream Your Life Away follows his debut EP, “God Loves You When You’re Dancing,” and will be produced by Ryan Hadlock. Hadlock is known for collaborating with The Lumineers, Gossip and The Foo Fighters. The majority of Joy’s 13-song album was recorded outside of Seattle, with three of them, “Mess is Mine,” “Winds of Change” and “Georgia,” being completed in a tree house on the studio’s ground.
Dream Your Life Away builds on Joy’s mellow folk-pop sound and takes listeners on a journey that shows off Joy’s artistic growth. Interlaced into each track are poetic references and allusions to Joy’s life. Though listeners can appreciate the album on its own, these references make the experience all the more enjoyable by adding another layer of meaning to Joy’s heartfelt vocals and catchy melodies.
The album opens with “Winds of Change,” a song that helped ignite Joy’s songwriting career in 2009. In the article by Mushroom Music Publishing Joy states,“It was a breakthrough. It planted the seed in my head of me being able to write good songs … ‘Winds of Change’ was the first coherent song I wrote that I wanted to show people. I’m glad that song opens that album,” Joy said.
The song invites listeners to embark on a journey and marks the first time Joy discovered his creative voice.
“It was the change in my songwriting,” Joy said.  “I discovered that strumming rhythm. It started something.”
Dream Your Life Away also features Joy’s single, “Riptide,” which blends comfortably with his other compositions. Though Joy calls “Riptide” one of his favorites, listeners will be pleasantly surprised by the strength of the album’s other songs.
Immediately  following “Riptide” is “Who Am I,” a song that pays homage to poet W. B. Yeats. Joy was inspired by the idea of laying dreams at someone’s feet and hoping they are not crushed, from the poem, “The Wind Among the Reeds.” The carefully crafted lyrics and earnest sound of his music make Dream Your Life Away an album bound to play on repeat.
The song “Riptide”,  one of the few songs completed in the studio’s treehouse, is another one of Joy’s favorites. He explains that  it came on the heels of a hectic tour schedule and reaffirmed his creativity. “Georgia” is a tender ballad with a soothing rhythm. His earnestness and clever lyrics make this track one of the album’s gems.
Even the title of the album bears special significance. Joy identified with the “People say I’m crazy, doing what I’m doing,” line from John Lennon’s 1981 classic “Watching the Wheels.” In addition to inviting listeners to lose themselves in his music, Joy feels the title reflects his life.
“It’s still all totally new to me,” Joy said. “I still feel new, which is good. I still feel like I’m just chipping away.” Mentioned in the press release the launch of his new album coincides with an international tour, similar to the one sparked by “Riptide,” which promises to be smooth sailing.

Following key performances in USC’s upset of then-No. 13 Stanford in Palo Alto this weekend, junior defensive end Leonard Williams and senior kicker Andre Heidari were named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week and Special Teams Player of the Week, respectively.
Leading up to the game, Williams’ sprained ankle kept his  status in question. But Williams’ decision to play through his injury came as no surprise to many Trojan fans, as he played all of last season with a torn labrum in his right shoulder.
The Daytona Beach, Florida native recorded 11 total tackles, including one tackle for loss and a  sack on Stanford’s final drive of the game, which helped maintain the 13-10 victory for the Trojans.
“It was just a really gritty performance,” USC head coach Steve Sarkisian said in his weekly Q&A on YouTube. “[Williams] was not 100 percent healthy, that’s for sure. I thought he got better as the game went on. I think in the fourth quarter he was especially dominant, and he provided a real spark and a real sense of leadership, especially when Hayes was ejected there on the targeting penalty.”
With the clock winding down, the game was quite reminiscent of last year’s victorious Stanford game. Heidari — apparently unshaken by nerves — stepped onto the field with 2:30 left in the fourth, his mind set on one thing: clearing the goal posts and putting the Trojans up by three points.
When Heidari nailed the 53-yard field goal, it was not only  his career-best, but it also tied for the third-longest in USC history. Heidari’s kick secured the win for the Trojans, just like last year when he hit a 47-yard field goal with 19 seconds left in the game.
Heidari also made a 25-yard field goal to tie the game with only 53 seconds left in the third quarter.
“We know what he’s capable of,” Sarkisian said of Heidari. “We wanted to get him closer to that. I thought it showed. When you can hit a 53-yard game-winning field goal, that is just unbelievably impressive. Probably equally impressive was the kickoff following the made field goal that he kicked out of the back of the end zone so that Ty Montgomery couldn’t get a return.”
Heidari and Williams will have to have big games again this Saturday against Boston College.

The Trojan football team was back on the field on Monday following a narrow 13-10 win at Stanford last weekend.
As always, the team paid no attention to its big win on Saturday and focused all its efforts on the upcoming game at Boston College this Saturday.
Haden penalized
The Pac-12 Conference fined USC Athletic Director Pat Haden $25,000 on Monday for his actions at Saturday’s game. At Stanford, Haden received a text  beckoning him from the press box to the sideline, where he confronted the game officials regarding some of their previous calls.
Outburst · USC Athletic Director Pat Haden was fined $25,000 by the Pac-12 for confronting officials on the sideline at Saturday’s game. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“The conduct by [Haden] was inappropriate,” said Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott in a statement. “Such actions by an administrator in attempt to influence the officiating, and ultimately the outcome of a contest, will not be tolerated.”
Prior to receiving the fine, Haden publicly apologized for his actions via USC’s RipsIt Blog.
“I apologize to Commissioner Scott, to the game officials, to Stanford and to the fans for any distraction I might have caused during Saturday’s football game,” Haden said. “In retrospect, I should not have approached the game officials. I should have waited until after the game and gone through the appropriate channels. In the best interests of our team and our coaches, I will stay off the sidelines for our next two games.”
Despite Haden’s apology, people around the country called for Haden’s recusal from the College Football Playoff Selection Committee.
College Football Playoff Executive Director Bill Hancock, however,  silenced those whispers.
“Emotional outbursts at games are not a matter for the playoff selection committee to deal with,” Hancock said in a statement. “This does not affect Pat Haden’s capability as a committee member. We recognize that athletic directors cannot be dispassionate about their own teams, and that’s why we have the recusal policy.”
Sarkisian acknowledged the penalties in his weekly Q&A with USC Athletics.
“I was out of line,” Sarkisian said. “I regret asking [Haden] to come down. It’s my job to manage the game and in the future that’s how I’ll handle it.”
Slow and steady
Sarkisian lauded his team’s ability to execute different styles of offense and come out on top. After setting a Pac-12 record by running 105 plays in the season opener, the Trojans only snapped the ball 59 times against the Cardinal last weekend.
“The beauty for us is that we can be able to go up-tempo and play fast and score a bunch of points,” Sarkisian said. “We showed a lot of versatility — the willingness and the ability to play kind of a grind-it-out type game against Stanford where possessions were at a premium … That we were able to win in that style as well, I think, is going to go a long way for us in the future.”
Road trip, round two
Sarkisian and the Trojans refuse to rest on their laurels following their win over Stanford, since the squad has to hit the road again for its game in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts this Saturday.
“This is a unique trip, when you start traveling over 3,000 miles for an 8 [p.m.] kickoff game,” Sarkisian said. “Boston College is gonna be a hungry football team. They’re big, they’re physical … We know this is gonna be a great challenge going across the country, playing those guys in a night game. I’m sure their students and crowd will be all fired up.”
Last year when the Trojans had two straight road games, they went 2-0, posting dominating wins at Oregon State and California.

When the NCAA announced that it would be reinstating Penn State University’s postseason eligibility on Monday, the first thing to pop in to my mind as a Trojan was, “Oh, great.” Because, you know, USC didn’t just come out of four years of scholarship sanctions and a two-year postseason ban for not keeping close enough tabs on the housing situation of a certain current Detroit Lions running back.
So USC — admittedly, in the interest of football — allegedly looked the other way as a once-in-a-generation talent received improper benefits and got punished for four years. Penn State — admittedly, in the interest of football — protected and covered up the actions of a man who was convicted on 45 counts of sexual abuse. And yet USC served out its sanctions, coaches lost their jobs and the NCAA went to inordinate lengths to keep the documents that would reveal potentially damning internal communications in the Todd McNair case. Penn State, on the other hand, just had its postseason ban and scholarship reduction cut two years short.
I’ll be the first to admit that when Penn State was initially sanctioned in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, I recoiled at how harsh and swift the punishment was. I really believed Penn State’s players and fans should not have been crippled by such draconian sanctions so deeply into the future for something that had happened in the past. I came to realize that the sanctions would be justified insofar as they brought a sense of closure to Sandusky’s victims, and with the gradual understanding that the football program was partially responsible for fostering Sandusky’s terrifying, almost systematic sexual abuse of minors.
Today, the NCAA announced that it disagreed with the rationale I so carefully adopted. Instead of trying to recover whatever shred of credibility they had left, the NCAA just threw its considerable weight and did what was in the best interest of revenues and Penn State’s sizable fan base.
The NCAA didn’t establish a sound policy of punishment when doling out sanctions. There’s no need to deter sexual abuse in college football coaching ranks: it’s (hopefully) universally recognized that sexually abusing minors is terribly wrong. There’s no need to rehabilitate any of the existing coaching staff beyond what has already been done. Actually, the NCAA’s theory of punishment is quite simple: it’s whatever the hell the NCAA wants it to be. According to the NCAA, the whole point of sanctioning the football program was because Penn State put football before basic human decency — so it’s only fitting that the NCAA then subsequently un-punish the football team, right?
The only thing this latest move from the NCAA proves is that President Mark Emmert cares only about flouting his power at a time when the NCAA is scraping for relevance. It’s one of the governing body’s worst PR moves in recent memory — and believe me, for the NCAA, that’s really saying something.
It was hard to justify putting Penn State in the doghouse, but it’s even harder to justify the reversal. Did Emmert just pat Penn State’s football program on the head, say “good dog” and call it a day? If so, it just shows us that the NCAA has its own agenda, one that no person with strategic communications acumen (or, you know, common sense) could possibly endorse.
My friend’s brother-in-law is a die-hard Penn State fan who was absolutely crushed when he heard about the Jerry Sandusky scandal and the sanctions that followed. When I’d see him at family gatherings, I’d commiserate with him about the NCAA sanctions, saying that as a USC fan I knew how he felt. I’d tell him that everything was going to be OK, that USC had found a way to fight through sanctions and come out on top and that Penn State would eventually recover. I was right; Penn State has one of the best recruiting classes in the nation according to Rivals.com, and the rescinding of the postseason ban and scholarship reduction comes as a boost to a program that really didn’t need one.
This leaves only the literal dozens of sexual abuse victims in Sandusky’s wake, slapped in the face by a governing body’s sickening greed and thirst for power. What will happen now? An asterisk will be forever appended to former Penn State head coach Joe Paterno’s record. A perennially powerful football program will, once again, rise to prominence. And the theory of punishment held by the NCAA will remain as amorphous and questionable as ever.
As for what this means for the NCAA, it’s another chink in the armor of the organization’s shaky logic of college athletics governance. Asinine decisions such as the rescinding of the Penn State sanctions will eventually give way to the NCAA’s collapse as a legitimate governing body. Slowly but surely, this is the way the NCAA ends: not with a bang, but with little whimpers.

 UPDATE, Sep. 12, 2014, 5:20 p.m.: A previous version of this column stated that Reggie Bush allegedly received improper benefits from the university. Though such allegations were made and the statement written is technically true, the article was amended to reflect the more precise allegation which led to the sanctions themselves. The Daily Trojan regrets any confusion.
PS4RS (Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship) issued the following media statement on the NCAA sanction reductions:  
 “We are very happy that some of the sanctions have been rescinded. This is great news for the football team, and the entire unfairly punished Penn State community. However, there are still wrongs to be righted. The Freeh conclusions are not supported by evidence, and they never should have been used as a pretext for sanctioning Penn State. We are disheartened by false rationalizations that Penn State has somehow changed or atoned to deserve this “reward.” Penn State athletics programs have ALWAYS demonstrated the highest level of integrity. Three years after their indictment, the three Penn State administrators have yet to have their day in court due to mysterious appeals by Penn State and clandestine document sealing by the PA court system. Prosecutor Frank Fina has publicly stated that there was no evidence to support the Freeh Report’s conclusion that Joe Paterno was aware of or participated in a cover up. Further, the NCAA’s new sexual assault reporting handbook instructs coaches around the country to do exactly what Paterno did in 2001.  There is no basis for ANY of the sanctions and they must be entirely rescinded.”

‘V. March 19, 2001: Curley Meets with Second Mile Leadership
Curley testified at the Grand Jury that he met “the executive director of the Second Mile. I shared the information that we had with hirn.” The Special Investigative Counsel found no written records concerriing this meeting.
The Second Mile executive director declined to be interviewed. Counsel for the Second Mile told the Special Investigative Counsel, however, that the executive director told hirn that the executive director had a calendar entry for a meeting with Curley on March 19, 2001 [362]. He also told counsel that during the executive director’s meeting with Curley that Curley related that an unidentified person saw Sandusky in the locker room shower on campus with a boy and felt uncomfortahle with the situation; [363] and that Curley had discussed the issue with Sandusky and concluded that nothing inappropriate occurred. [364] According to Counsel for the Second Mile, Curley told the executive director, that “to avoid publicity issues,” the Uriiversity would not permit Sandusky to bring kids on campus. [365] Curley also told the executive director that he was telling Second Mile so that the executive director could emphasize the issue to Sandusky. [366]
The executive director later advised two Second Mile Trustees of the meeting, and they concluded the matter was a “non-incident for the Second Mile and there was no need to do anything further.” [367] He also talked to Sandusky, who adrnitted showering with hoys but nothing More. [368] The executive director passed on Curley’s advice on the prohihition against bringing kids on campus, and Sandusky responded that it applied only to the locker roorns. [369] The executive director urged hirn to get the issue clarified. [370]’
Penn State (Curley) told Sandusky’s organization, the Second Mile, about the incident – there was NO coverup,
Court questions NCAA penalties in Sandusky case
April 9, 2014 7:49 pm ET
CBS Sports
‘The validity of the NCAA’s landmark consent decree with Penn
State was questioned by a Pennsylvania state court Wednesday in a decision that could have far-reaching implications.
The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court said the NCAA might not have had the legal right to force Penn State to agree to the decree in 2012 that stopped just short of a death penalty for the football program. That decree resulted from the NCAA’s unprecedented
involvement in the outcome of the Jerry Sandusky scandal.
“ … given the many discrepancies between the consent decree and the NCAA constitution and bylaws, there exists genuine factual disputes,” said Judge Anne Covey in the majority opinion.
She questioned, “whether the NCAA acted in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.”
The court further wrote, “The Consent Decree expressly recognizes the NCAA’s questionable involvement in and its dubious authority pertaining to a criminal action against a non-university official [Sandusky] which involved children who were non-university student-athletes.”
In his dissenting opinion, Judge Dan Pellegrini said he was “bewildered” Penn State would enter into agreement with the NCAA on issues that “ordinarily would not be actionable by the NCAA.” ‘
Yeh, I knew most if not all of that, I guess nothing new then? I think alot of people were caught blindsided,  we in Pennsylvania knew what was happening because of the March 2011 report which came out before the Political Correct crowd came out! I readnthat news organizations didn’t say anything back then because of Slander, but Penn State University didn’t have to worry about the same Slander of Sandusky? Hypocrite’s today rule the Media world!
Keep up the good work, and we will get JoePa and his boys wins back, sooner rather than later! And make sure everyone contacts the University by phone and by email about the Paterno family and them removing the Gideon Bible from their hotel rooms on campus!
God Bless America! 
“So USC — admittedly, in the interest of football — allegedly gave improper benefits to a once-in-a-generation talent and got punished for four years.”   
How can we expect the national media to write about our sanctions correctly when our own students and paper can’t get it right? 
USC was never accused of giving improper benefits to Reggie – We were slammed with a LOIC because “We should have known” that he was receiving benefits from wanna be agents, who also happened to be felons, 120 miles away. “High profile athletes need high profile compliance” according to Paul Dee.
By the NCAA who think they’re the Kings! Who smuggled phones, and have lost their dignity in so many improper ways!
I ask what happened to North Carolina?
Notre Dame?
There is so many who they have done nothing to? For real academic problems!
God Bless America! 
First off, what happened at PSU, never fell within the NCAA’s realm! If anyone with brains reads the Freeh Report they will understand how wrong they were! There are two pieces of factual evidence which one can claim JoePa did it, as they both contain his signature,  and both do speak about Sandusky. The first was JoePa’s disagreement with the University for retiring Sandusky with Emeritus recognition when he never was a Professor or taught a class. The second was a direct request from JoePa to not allow, along with the above retirement,  the Privilege to have Sandusky bring his 2nd Mile kids around the Football facilities due to….LIABILITIES! All the rest which is attributed to JoePa are great stretches at most, and on top if this they forget to remind the readers how the University had dumped every email and servers to install an entire new system! According to Pennsylvania Law at the time, JoePa did exactly what he was supposed to do, and then stay out of it to not make it look as if he was fighting FOR Sandusky. Also most forget or don’t know that in the meeting that JoePa nset up for the only witness there was the President,  the Athletics Director,  and the Police Chief of a real Police Station, JoePa didn’t go for the straight fact that he was not a direct witness and only a hearsay witness which is not legal, in most States! Also remember this, the actual witness first reported this to his father and a Medical Doctor, who didn’t recommend calling the police but to make an appointment with JoePa? I just wish a few things, first everybody forget what the lying national media says and go and read the Freeh Report. Second, ask for all emails to be released! All emails to include the emails between the University,  the Freeh Group,  and of course the lovely NCAA, which today in Pennsylvania courts they’re all fighting to remain PRIVATE? What are they hiding, especially when they said they had no communications prior to the Freeh Report?
What happenednat Penn State University is one of the biggest reason trust and faith with the NCAA has shrunk with all of the major conferences! Also this is the NCAA who smuggled a cell phone into a penitentiary and supplied to a convicted felon? Who slapped other University’s on the wrist when murder was involved! If there were facts to prove JoePa’s guilt then show it, but when accusations and insinuations are all they have then we should never entrust this organization with anything! Have we not had enough of Organizations telling us who are great role models or not? I hate Political Correctness but I am reminded of a trial  over trees, was postponed until the media fervor fell off and that was in Alabama over the Alabama-Auburn tree poisoning case! It is time to understand how unfairly a football coach was treated when nobody complained about parenting! I know some will be upset from that last comment but I was raised by a single mother from 2nd grade, once I was sponsored and received a YMCA membership for free. My mother made phone calls and explained that I should have to work for that free membership card,  but the point is she called and asked the proper questions and that was in the 70s!
God Bless America!
PS
This is far from over but instead of being divisive,  find out the facts and ask the proper questions! The NCAA needs to be held responsible,  the University’s lack of leadership needs answered also. But more importantly did the NCAA tell the University to select Freeh? I ask that because we now know how Emmert got his job?
God Bless America! 
You ask Curley about the decision not to report in 2001.
There’s many questions and I hope that are asked come those trials! But I think I know why? Sandusky was proven innocent in 1998 and then felt it wan not needed but I’m not talking about Curley, I’m talking about JoePa and if I need to ask about Curley then why not ask every parent where they were?
God Bless America! 
Sandusky was never ‘proven innocent’ in 1998.  You continue that lie whenever you post anywhere.
Ask Curley about his conversation with Paterno reference reporting Sandusky to the DPW.
How many more State Organizations could have investigated him? I won’t get into ansparring match! But why don’t you write down each organization so everybody knows , and keep the list honest! Sandusky wasn’t placed in jail, and nothing happened? So go spin your weave but be honest!
To be honest, I wish one of those organizations would have found something back then, jow many other childrrn would have been spared? But before you thrownin JoePa, ask where the parents were? So stop jabbing and get to work with that list of organizations!
God Bless America! 
How do the failures of 1998 exonerate the Paterno 4 in their failures in 2001?
Paterno, Spanier, Schultz and Curley failed those victims.
For one thing Sandusky was no longer an employee of JoePa! Second, read the 2 letters from JoePa and they resolve him of the other’s problems. Just imagine if they would have listened to JoePa and none of this would have happened! First, to not retire Sandusky under Emeritus Status which would have not given Sandusky the access to any facilities let alone an office! Second, where JoePa asked to restrict Sandusky’s 2nd Mile from ALL Football Facilities in fear of …..LIABILITIES! Apparently,  you don’t comprehend what you’re reading, and those are the only 2 pieces of factual evidence! All of the rest is speculation and insinuations to make an innocent man appear guilty just like the video tape of Baltimore Ravens Rb, how dopid the NFL think the woman became unconscious? They bowed to Political Correctness pressure after making a bad decisions, which is what happened with the NCAA and PSU! Anytime you bow down instead of lead you are in trouble but with today’s leadership in OUR White House and this is the norm! Penn State University should have wanted the whole truth but yet they bunkered down and gave the Political Correctness twerps what they wanted! Also I have read the Freeh Report multiple times andnI also saw and heard what the Commander of Pennsylvania State Police said and he gave JoePa a thumbs up and stated that if JoePa did anymore the appearance could have HURT the Investigation and that was on television live! Apparently you don’t know half of the proper information!  For example, did you know that the guy who fired JoePa had a brother that the FBI investigated for threatening letters? Did you know that brother had a son, that son didn’t play much but he did sleep in Sandusky’s basement? Learn all of the facts before spewing hate and reread the Freeh Report with an open mind to include this, multiple participants in the Freeh Group told the press that their report was never, NEVER, intended for the way it was used, it wasn’t thorough enough for any conviction,  that’s why the NCAA used it? Also why will the NCAA, PSU, and the Freeh Group not release any emails from before, during, and after the the Freeh Report?  Why does the NCAA not want to speak in the court of law about their decisions? Who recommended Freeh to PSU for the report? Could it have been the same group who got Emmert his job, do you even know what I’m talking about? You’re way behind the 8 Ball and for some reason believe JoePa ruled over the entire PSU and their facilities and professor’s? He was just a great head coach, nothing more and nothkng less, but you make him out as some sort of Supreme Commander! He was just a great man who dedicated his time efforts, and money for a University he was proud of and nothing more! But if we learn just one thing from this terrible time, it should be how poor leadership during a difficult time can ruin so much and what kind of leadership was the BoT demonstrating? The new Bunkering Style? The Pass the Buck Approach? I have been to multiple Leadership Schools and never learned of any of these types but I see them everyday now! From the NCAA, the NFL, and especially in OUR White House! So God Bless you and God Bless America!
PS
Reread the Freeh Report with honest heart and don’t put words into the air without thought and honesty!
God Bless America! 
I’ll entirely honest with you.  Your post is too long and not formatted well.
Paterno, Spanier, Schultz and Curley all sat on a report of child sexual abuse for 10 years.  They only talked to law enforcement officials when they were subpoenaed in 2011.
Well I didn’t know there were grades being given or that the format really mattered as long as the facts were well represented, I watch television sometimes when I’m writing but for you, I’m sorry it may be choppy! However,  the facts are the facts and apparently you were not brushed up on them as you thought? Now go back and read ALL of the facts and review to include the FBI Reports, the Commander of the Pennsylvania State Police,  and whatever else that is out there, and then read the Freeh Report slowly and without your mind already made up! It seems that others didn’t mind the format? And then go fight for one of the greatest, greatest college football coaches of all time, who earned the right to be given a proper, and truthful hearing with actual testimony and people sworn in and on the record! To include the NCAA, Bot and anyone from PSU involved, and of course the Freeh Group!
God Bless America!
PS
I’m watching The Bridge right now!
God Bless America! 
Where’s the 2001 police report?  That is the key to rehabilitating Paterno’s image.
You have lost your argument! To insist on things that aren’t there is an excuse, instead of reviewing what is there! Also maybe we will get the full picture if a couple of things happen, first the trials of the head shed,  second is to get the NCAA, the Freeh Group,  and the so called PSU leadership or the BoT inside and under oath in a Pennsylvania Court House! Also JoePa’s image is not tarnished! I went to a RockUSA Festival and questioned many, many people, men and women, mostly from Wisconsin and Michigan or UP and almost everyone believes JoePa was shoved under the bus and don’t believe he did anything wrong but was the Scapegoat! So it seems that our trustworthy elitist and our phony crisis creating national media are the only one’s with a problem even as all those involved are fighting to stay out of a Court House,  and I’m talking about the NCAA, PSU, and the Freeh Group! So as far as I’m concerned JoePa is fine while it is the University that has the image problem, with their use of a Bunkering Down and Blame Another leadership styles, which we see daily in our White House! So go home and take a break because you’re losing and Public Opinion has shifted and we will eventually, sooner rather than  later, again show our appreciation towards the best college football head coach with an honorable track record! The only person I haven’t heard you blame was George Bush?  So go take your pills or whatever drives your mind and hatred toward our great role model, JoePa! Why don’t you go find out where the 2001 report is, however,  most of us can read and comprehend what happened in 1998 and how flawed the Freeh Report is and was done on purpose which is why those entities don’t want to release their before, during, and after the Freeh Report emails!
Also admit that there is only 2 items in the entire Freeh Report with JoePa’s signature and if JoePa has all of this ALL MIGHTY POWER which only the ignorant believe he did, then imagine if they would have just followed those 2 simple requests and acknowledge that this would have never have happened to begin with? Acknowledge that much!
Nice try otherwise!
God Bless America! 
So, why did Paterno, Spanier, Schultz and Curley sit on a report of child sexual abuse for 10 years?
You have absolutely no proof that JoePa sat on anything! Now stop placing a coach with only coaches power and mix him up with Administrator’s,  I showed you the only two pieces of evidence which had JoePa’s signature,  which if he had all of this so called power, JoePa would have forced those 2 through, and we wouldn’t be here today! 2001 Sandusky was no longer a JoePa employee, you do know that right? They were not friends,  they were not extremely close, and even the football player’s have confirmed this! Good luck but don’t become an investigator or anything where comprehension is necessary! 
Paterno is made of aware on child sexual abuse in the Lasch (PSU football) showers the day after it happened in 2001.  Paterno did not speak to law enforcement about it until 2011.  That’s 11 years of not giving a crap.
From the Commander of the Pennsylvania State Police,  JoePa did the right thing! According to the Pennsylvania Laws of that time! You can keep trying but what the facts are is JoePa was absolutely no witness, it was hearsay and that’s it! Also by excusing himself, and as a leader myself I know this, you’re keeping it honest by not intervening or making it even worse looking than it should be! JoePa was just Penn State’ s football coach, and Sandusky wasn’t in his employment services in 2001, you do understand that? So I think you are a weak leader just like the BoT and like I said those who know little like yourself are be shaken off and the majority is WINNING! Also why no problems with the parenting, where were their parent (s)? Where is that responsibility?
Apparently you don’t like JoePa, it shows and that’s why your ignorant to the facts! Answer one question,  if before Sandusky was retired, if the Administration would have done what JoePa asked, the 2 actual pieces of evidence in the Freeh Report,  would we even be here today? Just answer that or leave me alone as I have much more intelligent work to do! Shut up or put up!
God Bless JoePa and the Paterno family!
God Bless America! 
No, they said he failed morally.
You’re talking about the Political Correct bunch in front of the Political Correct lying National Media, I’m talking on Fox Sports Pittsburgh and again on the radio, explaining Pennsylvania’s Laws at that time! You are either really young or really silly because all you do is repeat or better yet regurgitate obsolete information without none of your own investigation!
Did you hear the fans after the Penn State Victory in New Jersey? They were stomping and clapping,”Joe…Paterno!”, and that is a Super Majority!  The only people that are against the facts are those jealous of JoePa and the Paterno’s!
Again just answer my question! If the all super- powerful, pulls all the strings, master of the campus JoePa, had all of that power then why weren’t the only 2 pieces of factual evidence in the Freeh Report, with legite JoePa’s signature, were actually acted on as he REQUESTED,  we wouldn’t be here today! True or false?
 Apparently,  you don’t know or understand procedures or all of the work that goes into a Head coaching job at every level, but especially Division 1 or in the NFL!
So if you want to keep complaining then answer the question and also realize how much we now know about that Political Correctness hack who had the nerve to judge anyone,  especially JoePa over morals! Do you even know her name?
God Bless America! 
Go read the Freeh Report!
God Bless America! 
Read the Freeh Report several times.  Did you miss the parts where the Paterno 4 failed to notify law enforcement?
The Freeh Report has sooo many flaws, the report is unreliable.
Spanier is currently suing Freeh for defamation.
From PS4RS (Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship) issuing the following media statement on the NCAA sanction

Jerry Sandusky prosecutor: No evidence Joe Paterno participated in criminal cover-up at Penn State
September 03, 2013 at 8:18 PM, updated September 03, 2013 at 10:31 PM
Pennlive
‘Another key figure in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse case weighed in Tuesday with his take on whether former Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno was an active participant in efforts to cover up Sandusky’s sex crimes.
In an interview recorded for CBS 60 Minutes Sports, former Chief Deputy Attorney General Frank Fina said flatly: “I did not find that evidence.”’
That is another lie.  The new report does not tell head coaches to discuss the investigation with the Athletic Director (Curley and Paterno did discuss it) and it does not tell the head coach to go back to the eye-witness and ask him if he is ok with what they are doing.
It’s amazing how the Paterno cult can twist things to their advantage.  If it was your child raped by Sandusky you would be howling for all their heads.
So, it’s politically correct to point out that Paterno along with Curley, Spanier and Schultz sat on a report of child sexual abuse for 10 years?  You have one seriously effed up code of ethics.
We can expect that if you are told of a person sexually molesting a child in the building you work in, you’ll stop at telling your boss.  More children could be raped and you will sleep fine.  You are disgusting.
PS4RS (Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship) are the biggest bunch of prevaricators in this whole mess.  They lie when the state Paterno did exactly as the new policy.  Nowhere does it state you tell the Athletic Director, nowhere does it state the head coach discuss what to do with the Athletic Director (Curley’s email) and nowhere does it state the head coach go to the eyewitness and as it the eyewitness is ok with the investigation.
Why would you listen to PS4RS?  They are masters of obfuscation and prevarication.
Please see Longtime Observer’s comment (Freeh, Report, Page 78) below.
What kind of man gets a report of child sexual abuse, tells his boss, talks once about it after that then asks the eyewitness if the eyewitness is ok with the investigation then walks away?
Seriously, Paterno saw Sandusky in the Lasch building after that and at functions.  How do you live with yourself knowing nothing was done?
Somebody more concerned with keeping his job, maintaining the illusion of success with honor than he was child safety.
That’s 10 years of seeing Sandusky, talking to Sandusky and never once escalating on Spanier, Schultz and Curley for having let Sandusky continue to rape children.
From the Thirty Third Statewide Investigating Grand Jury,
Page 6,
 “VICTIM 2
On March 1, 2002, a Penn State graduate assistant (“graduate assistant”) [Mike McQueary] who was then 28 years old, entered the locker room at the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus on a Friday night before the beginning of Spring Break. The graduate assistant, who was familiar with Sandusky, was going to put some newly purchased sneakers in his locker and get some recruiting tapes to watch. lt was about 9:30 p.m. As the graduate assistant entered the locker room doors, he was surprised to find the lights and showers on. …”
Paterno DID NOT witness anything. McQueary told Paterno. Paterno told McQueary to see Paterno’s boss, Curley, which McQueary did.
“Transcript: Joe Paterno’s Grand Jury Testimony
…
Q: To whom or with whom did you share the information that McQueary had given you?
Mr. Paterno: I talked to my immediate boss, our athletic director.
Q: What is that person’s name?
Mr. Paterno: Tim Curley.
Q: How did you contact Mr. Curley?
Mr. Paterno: I believe I did it by phone. As I recall, I called him and I said, hey, we got a problem, and I explained the problem to him.
Q: Was the information that you passed along substantially the same information that Mr. McQueary had given you?
Mr. Paterno: Yes.
…
Q: You indicated that your report was made directly to Tim Curley. Do you know of that report being made to anyone else that was a university official?
Mr. Paterno: No, because I figured that Tim would handle it appropriately.
I have a tremendous amount of confidence in Mr. Curley and I thought he
would look into it and handle it appropriately.
Q: We have no further questions of you.
Testimony concluded at 11:13 a.m. Date, January 12, 2011, 11:20 a.m.”
Addressing Sexual Assault and Interpersonal Violence
Athletics’ Role in Support of Healthy and Safe Campuses
Page iv, NCAA, Published 9/13/2014
“The Executive Committee expects NCAA members to ensure that the values and principles articulated in the Constitution to protect the health and safety of student-athletes, operate fairly and ethically, and further to assure that student-athletes are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by special treatment and that institutions’ athletics departments must:
• Comply with campus authorities and ensure that all athletics staff, coaches, administrators and student-athletes maintain a hostile-free environment for all student-athletes regardless of gender or sexual orientation; know and follow campus protocol for reporting incidents of sexual violence; report immediately any suspected sexual violence to appropriate campus offices for investigation and adjudication;”
Ok, where in the new policy does it state that Paterno was to review the investigation with Curley?  It doesn’t.  In fact the new policy forbids the athletic department from conducting the investigation.
Next, where in the new policy does it state the head coach should ask the eye witness if the eye witness is satisfied with the investigation?
Beyond this policy, what kind of man lets others spike a report of child sexual abuse?

Over and out.
So, you can’t show where Paterno’s actions are ok by the new NCAA policy?  I didn’t think so.
So here we have a man (Paterno) who is given an eyewitness report of child sexual abuse and he waits a day to tell the Athletic Director because he didn’t want to disturb anybody’s weekend.
How about Sandusky’s victim’s weekend?
More concern about Curley’s free time than that child’s safety.
Go ahead keep defending the indefensible.

Twelve-time National Coach of the Year Jovan Vavic had the USC men’s water polo team ready to go its opening weekend at the UCSD Triton Invitational. The No. 2 Trojans’ quest for a seventh straight national championship began Saturday and Sunday with four dominant victories, two of which came against top-15 opponents.
Goal getter · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias led the Trojans with 15 goals scored over the weekend, including two five-goal efforts. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
USC (4-0) started this Sunday with great confidence after a 19-3 victory over No. 11 UC Davis and a 24-5 victory over La Verne on Saturday. The Trojans came out of the gates strong in both matches with six straight goals against UC Davis and nine straight against La Verne.
Again on Sunday, USC started out hot with an 8-3 first quarter lead over Redlands before going on to rout the Bulldogs 27-7. The most anticipated game of the tournament featured USC vs. No. 5 Pacific. USC came out with a 10-3 win against the Tigers, which featured a key run of six unanswered goals. The last time USC faced Pacific was the 12-11 overtime showdown in the national championship; however, when asked about the rematch, Vavic played down the rivalry’s intensity.
“In the meeting before the game, I didn’t say anything about the championship,” Vavic said. “I personally did not think about the championship. It’s a new season. This is not only a talented Trojan team but also a disciplined one that takes everything one game at a time.”
Many new players including freshman two-meter Lachlan Edwards and freshmen utility men James Walters and Mihajlo Milicevic scored their first collegiate goals this weekend. In fact, USC’s true and redshirt freshmen accounted for more than half of the goals scored over the weekend (41 out of 80) and all 31 saves. Freshman goalie McQuin Baron came up big with 14 saves in the Pacific game. Vavic was proud of his young players.
“We have been training, but nothing replaces the game, which is why we have this first tournament where everyone can get experience,” Vavic said. “We played a whole lot of players including two freshmen goalies. The more experienced these freshmen become throughout the season, the more dangerous the number two team in the land becomes.”
There is no doubt this Trojan team has depth. Between the two games on Sunday, 15 Trojans scored goals, led by senior Kostas Genidounias who had seven in total. Vavic believes that the combination of talented youth as well as veterans is key to the team’s success.
“Chemistry is so important, and I really like how the older boys and the younger boys work together,” Vavic said. “We played unselfishly and were really sharing the ball.”
This weekend’s results were no surprise to the Trojans. USC has won at least its first four games of the season every year since 2001.
Vavic emphasizes his players knowing their roles as the key to USC’s hot start season after season.
“It is very important that everyone understands what their roles are, and once you know your role and feel comfortable in it, then the players build confidence,” Vavic said. “Today the game was pretty close, we were up 4-2, but then one minute to the end of the game we were up 10-2.”
It was a team of big runs in USC that prevailed in the Triton Invitational this weekend. They start the season undoubtedly in contention for another championship. The Trojans look to carry their momentum from this weekend into the Inland Empire Classic from Sept. 13-14.

Senior kicker Andre Heidari played the role of hero for the second straight season on Saturday, helping the USC football team steal a 13-10 win over Stanford with a dramatic late field goal.
Heidari’s career-long 53-yarder came with 2:30 left in the fourth quarter, leaving the No. 13 Cardinal (1-1, 0-1 Pac-12) one last chance to win or tie the game. Senior linebacker J.R. Tavai ended that opportunity, sacking Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan to force a fumble at the USC 27-yard-line with 19 seconds remaining.
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler then kneeled to seal the victory for the No. 14 Trojans (2-0, 1-0). The play marked Tavai’s first career forced fumble.
“To be honest it felt like a normal play,” Tavai said. “But making a play that big comes once in a while. When the opportunity comes, you just gotta take it.”
The USC defense looked shaky for large stretches of the game, but was saved by a less-than-impressive showing from the Cardinal in the redzone. Stanford took the ball inside the Trojans’ 20-yard-line five times, only managing to score twice. USC head coach Steve Sarkisian was impressed by his defense’s ability to bend but not break.
“If we weren’t a strong-willed team, there’s a lot of times we could’ve folded,” the first-year coach said. “Couldn’t be prouder of our defense in the red zone. It was a huge point of emphasis coming into the game.”
The first half was a story of missed opportunity for the Cardinal offense. The team drove all the way to the USC 21-yard line on its opening drive, but settled for a long field goal try after a 15-yard tripping penalty. Jordan Williamson’s field goal attempt went wide, setting the stage for the Trojans’ first score.
Kessler started the game a perfect four-for-four, including a 10-yard strike to sophomore running back Justin Davis that put the Trojans on the Stanford one-yard-line. Davis punched in a touchdown on the next play.
USC converted three third downs on its only first-quarter drive, wearing down Stanford’s front seven with an up-tempo attack. Davis’ touchdown was the Stockton, California native’s first score of the season and the seventh of his career.
The Cardinal again found themselves in the redzone on their second series, but the offense’s hopes were thwarted after a direct snap sailed over wide receiver Ty Montgomery’s head for a loss of 16 yards.
Stanford head coach David Shaw elected to punt from the USC 29-yard-line, leading to a three-and-out for USC. This resulted in redshirt junior punter Kris Albarado finally seeing the field, his first action in over five quarters of play.
Stanford’s third trip to the redzone finally paid off in the form of a two-yard yard touchdown from fullback Patrick Skov. Hogan looked strong on the drive, completing passes of 20-plus yards to running back Remound Wright and tight end Anthony Hooper. USC’s secondary looked lost as Hogan was consistently able to find wide open receivers, a trend that would continue for most of the day.
The Trojans’ next drive stalled after Stanford’s Peter Kalambayi sacked Kessler for 10-yard loss directly after an intentional grounding call. The two teams racked up a combined 155 penalty yards over the course of the game, with the Trojans accounting for 10 total penalties. One of those penalties, a third-quarter targeting call on senior linebacker Hayes Pullard, resulted in Pullard’s automatic ejection.
Athletic Director Pat Haden came to the sideline to question the call, later explaining that Sarkisian did not want to risk arguing with officials after an earlier sideline warning.
Pullard, one of the team’s captains, will be forced to miss the first half of next week’s game at Boston College as well.
Stanford took its only lead of the contest just before halftime on a 33-yard field goal from Williamson, who would finish the game just one-for-three on field goal opportunities.
The Trojans would tie the game late in the third quarter on a 25-yard kick from Heidari, setting up the game’s thrilling final chapter.
A promising USC drive to open the fourth quarter ended on a fourth-down attempt at the Stanford 35-yard-line, when junior wideout Nelson Agholor was unable to hold onto a Kessler pass.
The Cardinal appeared poised to take the lead on their next series, when Hogan found tight end Anthony Hooper wide open in the end zone.
The play was called back after an illegal chop block, however, and Stanford was eventually forced to punt.
USC would take the ball back at its own seven-yard-line, starting a 58-yard drive that culminated in Heidari’s go-ahead field goal. The Bakersfield, California native kicked a similar game-winner in last year’s 20-17 upset of the Cardinal.
“As a kicker you always have to be ready every time you step on the field,” Heidari said. “I’m just glad I got the opportunity.”
Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen carried the load for the Trojans, finishing with 23 carries and a career-best 154 yards. Kessler, who only attempted 10 passes in the first half, finished 15-of-22 with 135 yards. The quarterback is now 2-0 against the Cardinal. Former quarterback Matt Barkley, on the other hand, never beat Stanford.
“The team has been through a lot, and you don’t always hear me say it,” Kessler said. “The guys fight hard and never give up. As a quarterback, that’s all you can ask for.”
Agholor reached a career-high nine receptions, picking up 91 yards along the way.
Though it was in no way pretty, Sarkisian was impressed with how things turned out.
“Obviously it’s a really exciting win,” Sarkisian said. “I have all the respect in the world for Stanford. They play the game hard. They play it right. They don’t give you much and you have to earn everything you get.”
The Trojans head to Boston College this weekend to take on the Eagles at 8 p.m. on Saturday.

Run, do not walk, to ISIS Land.” This is how “Welcome to the ‘Islamic State’ land” begins. The gruesome 69-second video goes on to show some of ISIS’s most graphic footage, depicting everything from militants killing individuals at point-blank range to suicide bombings and beheadings.
Vik Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
Set against a backdrop of eerie music, the footage of crucifixions and whippings is separated only by the occasional flash of text depicting the “useful new skills” ISIS followers can learn, including “blowing up mosques” and “crucifying and executing Muslims.” The YouTube video ends with a sarcastic message to would-be ISIS recruits: “Travel is inexpensive because you won’t need a return ticket!”
This wasn’t a spoof, though. Rather, it was the product of an official State Department campaign.
The video was produced and published online by the State Department’s “Think Again, Turn Away” initiative, which aims to “expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda,” according to the initiative’s official Facebook page. The campaign, launched last December, has taken to various platforms on social media to dissuade potential ISIS sympathizers from joining.
Though attempts by the U.S. government to oppose ISIS are to be expected, the video has neither the seriousness nor the appropriate platform to make any substantive impact. From the ominous background music to the inappropriate exclamatory statements, this type of content is expected from the hacktivist group Anonymous or even ISIS itself — but certainly not from a hegemonic power such as the United States.
ISIS’s primary means of communicating its goals and attracting followers has been on social media, such as the recently promoted videos depicting the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.
Adopting ISIS’s tactics is not an effective means of combatting their message. If anything, it can only serve to give their tactics more legitimacy. In the wake of the Foley and Sotloff videos, many journalists took to social media imploring users not to watch or disseminate ISIS’s videos so as not to give them the satisfaction or press they seek. In crafting satirical videos laden with ISIS’s most graphic content, the State Department has not only given the organization more attention than it deserves, but it has also legitimized it as a key player in the social media content war.
Ultimately, such a video has little chance of actually making a substantive impact. With no major platform beyond YouTube, the video itself has only gained a little more than 625,000 views as of press time. Further, most mainstream media sites, including CNN, won’t broadcast the entirety of the video in their coverage due to its graphic nature.
If someone is intent on joining ISIS, it’s unlikely that a 69-second video of graphic content is going to convince them otherwise. Rather than attempt to persuade vulnerable recruits through a poorly subscribed YouTube channel which boasts fewer than 2,000 subscribers, the U.S. government should be appealing to more authoritative sources who have a better chance of reaching these susceptible demographics.
ISIS is a real threat, and the violence committed in its name should be taken with utmost seriousness, especially by the U.S. government. Such satirical videos that utilize inappropriate attention-grabbing tactics, however, do not achieve that end.

I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own
problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait
with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out
instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and
peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which
is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be
discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in
the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an
alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that
emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a
band-aid on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for
our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as
friends.

The State Department recently released “Welcome to the ‘Islamic State’ land (ISIS/ISIL),” an anti-ISIS video mocking the terrorist group’s recruitment strategies. Criticized for featuring grisly and upsetting content, the video is nonetheless a step forward in combatting ISIS and its powerful social media machine.
Vik Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
The video is a part of the “Think Again, Turn Away” campaign that aims to dissuade potential recruits from joining ISIS. The campaign also has a presence on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr. The description of the campaign on its Facebook page reads, “Our mission is to expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda. Don’t be misled by those who break up families and destroy their true heritage.”
The threat is real. ISIS currently has more than 7,000 “foreign fighters,” according to USA Today. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said in a televised interview Sept. 3, “We have acknowledged publicly we are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with [ISIS] forces.” Americans Douglas McCain and Donald Morgan, as well as Canadian brothers Collin and Gregory Gordon, are just a few among many who have joined the terrorist cause. McCain was reportedly killed while fighting for ISIS late August, a reminder of the fatal consequences of radicalization as well as the fear that other Americans will follow suit.
According to the Telegraph, Syed Soharwardy, founder of the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada is “convinced that this recruitment is going on right here in this country, under our noses, in our universities, in our colleges, in the places of worship, in our community.” In fact, the Al-Hayat Media Center, an affiliate of ISIS, has been producing non-Arabic media geared toward Westerners. Among its efforts is “The Chosen Few of Different Lands,” a video posted in July featuring  “martyred” Canadian Andre Poulin. Near the end, Poulin is pictured running through a Syrian field during an airport siege before dying in the battle. The voiceover declares him “a brother who would be pleased with the bare minimum and still shine with happiness.” The glory of martyrdom and the rewards of sacrifice are both selling points in this type of propaganda.
To combat ISIS’s global reach, Western authorities need to intensify the fight against jihadist movements. The State Department’s video effectively undermines such misleading propaganda. Its satirical message cuts to the core of the militant group’s hypocrisy. Dripping with sarcasm, the video paints a brutal picture of reality as it asks those considering ISIS membership if the skills learned will fit their future career paths — “blowing up mosques,” “crucifying and executing Muslims” and “plundering public resources.”
Though disturbingly graphic, the video does its job in shattering the portrayal of ISIS as a group of heroes battling for their righteous interpretation of Islam. The images, in their brutal honesty, draw out a raw pathos that passive reading can’t fully evoke. Hopefully, hit by this surge of reality, potential converts will think twice about the situation and ask questions about what brand of Islam ISIS is really promoting.
To maximize this method, the counter-propaganda effort should come from both Western countries and governments like Qatar and Kuwait that sponsor ISIS. Reversing the propaganda machines in those countries with videos like this one will turn the tide in time.
