The No. 2 USC women’s golf team secured a victory at the Bruin Wave Invitational for its second win of the season on Monday and Tuesday. Although the Trojans were without junior Gabirela Ruffels for most of the tournament due to injury, all four remaining Trojans in the tournament placed in the top 11, helping USC edge out UCLA for the win on the final day of play.
Last week, the Trojans won the Rebel Beach Showdown after struggling to find the top podium spot at all their other events and saw four of their six players place in the top five as the team won in dominant fashion. Although the Rebel Beach Showdown did not boast many elite-tier teams, it was just enough for the Trojans to get the ball rolling as they were able to perform at the same level against much better teams this past week, including a number of Pac-12 foes such as UCLA and Oregon. 
Junior Amelia Garvey led the way for the Trojans at Bruin Wave with a fifth-place finish as she shot a solid even for the tournament while junior Alyaa Abdulghany also played well, finishing in sixth right behind Garvey. 
Remarkably, USC played with only four players for almost the entire tournament. Ruffels, who has been a key player and leader for the Trojans, had to drop out on the first day due to injury, but the rest of the team picked up the slack and made up for the loss to keep the Trojans in contention.
“We obviously missed Gabriela and hope to get her back as soon as possible,” head coach Justin Silverstein said. “I know she’s thrilled that her teammates were able to pick her up and get this done.”
While only Garvey was able to crack the top five, the team as a whole played well and consistently.
“This course is incredibly dicey and it took tons of discipline from Alyaa, Amelia, [senior] Allisen [Corpuz] and [sophomore] Malia [Nam] to finish this off with a win,” Silverstein said.
USC started off the tournament a bit slow as it finished the first day in fifth place out of 12 teams, but 3-under performances from Garvey, Abdulghany and Nam on the second day boosted the team into first place and the Trojans never looked back. In a match where every stroke mattered, the team provided a clutch performance and proved why USC is a top team in the nation. 
“I talked to Justin about it and there were two ways we could look at it,” Garvey said. “We could play the victim or step up to the challenge. So I think our mindset was huge. We were ready to take on the challenge and win.”
These two back-to-back wins should also keep USC within the top five for the rest of the year barring unforeseen circumstances. With postseason play approaching, the Trojans appear to be rounding into form as they seek another deep playoff run.
USC has only two more regular-season tournaments before Pac-12 play, where it will look to repeat as conference champions.  
The Trojans will get a two-week break before heading back out to play in the Clover Cup in Arizona beginning March 13.

We’ve already seen major sporting events in 2020 like the College Football Playoff and the Super Bowl, but aside from football, we still have a year full of championships to win in every sport, at every level. This week, I will make my predictions for the winners of the most high-profile remaining American sporting events this year — except for the upcoming March Madness, which I’ll dive into deeper in a couple of weeks.
The Masters: Justin Thomas 
Thomas is coming off a phenomenal season, during which he placed third in the FedEx Cup standings. At 26 years old, Thomas is nearing the prime of his career, so I expect him to have another big season on tour in 2020. 
Thomas has only one major win under his belt: the 2017 PGA Championship. He had historically good — not great —  outings at all majors, but he has seen steady improvement in the standings each year.
Thomas is currently first in the FedEx Cup standings, first in top-10 finishes and fourth in scoring average. Stats like these allude to my prediction that this is the year Thomas takes his game to the next level and finally pulls out another major win.
With Tiger Woods playing inconsistently and Brooks Koepka returning from injury, I think Thomas has a prime opportunity to steal the Masters early in the PGA season.
Stanley Cup: Vegas Golden Knights
Founded just a couple of seasons ago, the Golden Knights have quickly emerged as one of the NHL’s most exciting teams. The Golden Knights started out their first season with a bang by making it to the Stanley Cup Finals. Last year, they had another solid season where they made the playoffs but were quickly eliminated by the San Jose Sharks.
Vegas built a team based on all-around decent players who were underrated or didn’t quite fit in with their past clubs. Collectively, those players created a formidable contender.
This year, the Golden Knights are once again sitting atop the Pacific Division thanks to their offensive firepower from players like wingers Mark Stone and Max Pacioretty, and they are currently on a six-game win streak.
Defensively, goalie Marc-Andre Fleury has been outstanding. Other than him, however, stopping the puck has been an area of concern for the team. The Golden Knights might not have the most stacked team on paper compared to teams like the Boston Bruins or the Washington Capitals, but they will have to find ways to overcome those giants in the playoffs, and I believe they will.
NBA Finals: Los Angeles Lakers 
The Lakers have been Finals contenders since the day they acquired Anthony Davis, and so far, the Lake Show has lived up to the hype. With the second-best record in the league, the Lakers have looked formidable thanks to the duo of Davis and LeBron James, both of whom have put up highly impressive stats this season.
The one major area of concern will be L.A.’s role players: The Lakers need players like guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Alex Caruso and Danny Green and forward JaVale McGee to play at an extremely high level to provide the necessary support for Davis and James.
On paper, the Lakers have everything they need to win a title. They have superstars, shooters, hustlers, rebounders and defensive stoppers. But in reality, it seems like the team has relied a little too much on star duo. 
In addition, the Lakers will have to deal with other stacked rosters like the hometown rival Los Angeles Clippers, led by Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, as well as the Milwaukee Bucks, who have the NBA’s best record.
At the end of the day, however, I think LeBron and his crew will overcome those obstacles and prove they are the best team in the league come June.
World Series: Atlanta Braves 
The Braves suffered through the rebuilding process for several years, but recently, the team has taken major strides. Last season, the Braves finished first in the National League East in front of the eventual World Series winners, the Washington Nationals, but they made a quick playoff exit after losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Division Series.
One key player that has contributed to the Braves’ resurgence has been young outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr., who has put up massive numbers in his two MLB seasons. He and first baseman Freddie Freeman’s firepower should spearhead another deadly Braves offense this year. 
From a pitching standpoint, the Braves are once again stacked with a deep and trustworthy rotation, including Mike Soroka and Cole Hamels, and even bolstered their bullpen to give them depth at all positions.
However, the Braves will have no easy path to the World Series, as a number of other prominent teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees will be hungry for titles of their own. It’s going to take a complete and flawless postseason with minimal injuries, but I think the Braves have what it takes to win it all this October.

The USC baseball team earned an impressive road win over Cal State Fullerton Tuesday evening, defeating the Titans 7-1. A strong first inning kickstarted the Trojans as they jumped out to a 4-0 lead and did not look back.
Head coach Jason Gill was pleased with USC’s fast start to the contest. 
“Offensively, come on — you start off with a 4-0 lead in the first, that gives you a little cushion to pound a little bit more on the mound and throw strikes,” Gill said.
USC’s hot start was spearheaded by sophomore first baseman Clay Owens’ 2-run triple to put USC up 2-0. A pair of ensuing RBI singles from graduate student designated hitter Ben Wanger and sophomore catcher Tyler Lozano put the Trojans up comfortably at the end of the opening frame. 
Wanger was pleased with yet another strong offensive showing from the Trojans after scoring 11 unanswered runs in their Sunday win against San Diego State. 
“It feels good to put up a bunch of runs against a good team,” Wanger said. “We hit their guys pretty well, so great momentum moving forward.”
On the mound, USC benefited from a strong start from junior lefty Brian Gursky, who gave Gill — a CSUF alumnus — and his team 3.2 innings of scoreless work, allowing just a single hit before being pulled for relief. 
A brief scare for USC in the bottom of both the fourth and fifth innings saw the Titans load the bases with one out twice, but impressive work from freshman righty Ethan Hoopingarner and sophomore righty Carson Lambert saved the Trojans before the opposition could get on the scoreboard. 
Gill was complimentary of the bullpen’s performance in the win.
“The bullpen did pretty good,” Gill said. “We had a couple hiccups in there, but guys came in and picked up other guys.”
USC’s bats were consistently active for the remainder of the evening, tacking on additional insurance runs by way of another Wanger RBI in the fifth inning and a double from freshman center fielder Rhylan Thomas. Senior second baseman Tyler Pritchard — who scored on the double — would have easily been caught at home plate if not for an error by CSUF junior catcher Austin Schell.
After adding an additional run in the top of the fifth, sixth and seventh innings, the Trojans coasted to the win with a 6-run cushion. 
Tuesday’s win marked the second consecutive road victory of Gill’s tenure as head coach and the best defensive performance of the season, an encouraging sight for the Trojans moving forward.  
The win brings Gill and the Trojans to an overall record of 5-2 on the young season. 
The Trojans also faced Keio University in an exhibition match Wednesday evening but fell 5-0. Keio, which plays in Tokyo’s “Big 6 Baseball League,” lost to CSUF Monday by a score of 6-3, followed by a loss to UCLA last night by a score of 15-1. 
Wednesday’s matchup with the Trojans marks another stop on Keio’s West Coast exhibition tour, as it’ll head south for a contest with the University of San Diego Thursday. 
The Trojans will continue their homestand in a three-game weekend series against Seton Hall. The Pirates come into the weekend series riding a brief two-game losing streak handed to them by Liberty University. 
Seton Hall will come into the game with an overall record of 3-3 and will be led by senior infielder Connor Hood, who has started all six games so far for the Pirates. Hood leads the team with 11 hits and 8 RBIs in 27 plate appearances, good for a team-high .407 batting average. 
USC can expect to face off against Seton Hall senior righty Noah Thompson, who has started two games for the Pirates on the mound already. Thompson has racked up nine strikeouts in 11.2 innings so far this season, posting an earned run average of 2.31.
The Trojans’ weekend series is set to begin at 6 p.m. Friday evening at Dedeaux Field. Saturday’s game starts at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s at 1 p.m.

Addressing the crisis in working-class America, authors Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn stopped at USC Annenberg to discuss their latest New York Times Best-Seller.
The duo spoke at an event Wednesday alongside Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay about their latest book, “Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope,” and the crisis the left-behind population of rural Americans is facing at home. The event was presented in partnership with USC Speakers Committee.
Kristof, a New York Times columnist, and WuDunn, a business executive and best-selling author make up the first husband and wife to win a Pulitzer Prize together. They have co-authored five books, including the best-sellers “Half The Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide” and “A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity.”
The book explores the crisis of America’s modern governmental failures from the perspective of families living in the rural, working-class town of Yamhill, Ore., where Kristof grew up. 
Kristof and WuDunn are known for their work covering humanitarian crises abroad in places like Cambodia, India and Afghanistan. Given the unique focus and landscape of the book, Dean Bay kicked off the conversation by asking how the topic originated.
According to Kristof, the subject matter of the book was chosen organically. Years of observing his hometown through visits to family and friends slowly unveiled a crisis.
“We would come back from covering these overseas humanitarian crises to my hometown and we saw a humanitarian crisis unfold there in slow motion,” Kristof said. “A quarter of the kids on my old No. 6 school bus have died from drugs, alcohol and suicide.”
The topic of left-behind communities experiencing tragedy and stagnation right in America — which rarely garners enough national attention to enact change — was a focus of ssthe book talk.
While the duo knows Kristof’s hometown best, the authors made sure to iterate that the problems and plights the people in Yamhill face are not anomalies.
“We started doing more research nationwide to find out there is a lot of dysfunction going on in a lot of places in the country,” WuDunn said.
The promotional video for “Tightrope,” shared in front of the audience, illustrates some of this dysfunction. In the film, Kristof explains the severity of income inequality in the country.
“America is unique when it comes to income inequality — we are the richest country on the planet with the worst poverty,” Kristof said. “That’s who we are.” 
Like many rural communities, Yamhill has very little job opportunity, as well as high rates of addiction, little educational opportunity, lack of healthcare access and lower life expectancies. WuDunn discussed life expectancy rates in rural communities similar to Yamhill.
“There is lots of research now that shows that, depending on what ZIP code you are born in, we can predict with fairly good accuracy what your outcome’s going to be like in a couple of decades,” WuDunn said. 
Detailing her findings, WuDunn spoke of the parallels between U.S. cities and international cities typically known for gross poverty and inequality. 
“I mean, it’s unbelievable. One example is that a kid born in Shannon County, S.D. has a life expectancy that is lower than an infant born in Bangladesh or Cambodia. That’s stunning,” WuDunn said. And there are two other counties in Florida that have a lower life expectancy than babies born in Cambodia or Bangladesh”
Kristof and WuDunn said they believe that by sharing the deeply personal stories of people living in Yamhill, people can better understand how the government has failed many other rural communities. 
“We tend to overlook the fact that some of these people, they are struggling with drugs, but they have a talent,” WuDunn said. “We just think, ‘Oh gosh, they’ve messed up their lives, it’s a disaster,’ and often they just need a little bit of help. That’s the way we approached these characters.”
The two said the lack of empathy and the assumption that certain people are a lost cause who do not need support is a perspective shared by the government. WuDunn commented on how the United States’ perception abroad can skew realities at home.
“Think about child mortality — we are No. 41,” WuDunn said. “Forty-one of 148 countries that are actually measured by the Social Progress Index, which is something that was developed by three Nobel laureates, so it has a lot of credibility. For access to clean water, don’t you think America has great access compared to other countries? We are No. 44 with access to clean water.” 
As advocates for underserved rural communities without class privilege, Kristof and WuDunn said they hope to expose how American policies support some citizens but fail others.
“I think there’s often a tendency, and maybe particularly in California, to think that it’s too bad but this is because of global issues of technology and globalization and automation, and I don’t think that’s right,” Kristof said. “I think that’s a myth that we use to console ourselves. Fundamentally, this is about policy choices that we took as a nation.”
“Tightrope” exposes hidden problems and shares the stories of those whose voices often go unheard in the U.S. — stories that Kristof and WuDunn believe deserve to be told and prioritized.
During the discussion, Yuma Kim, senior majoring in international relations and human security and geospatial intelligence posed a question on staying hopeful and constructive while covering such heavy issues.
Kristof responded optimistically, leaving the audience hopeful.
“People often think that because I cover genocide and human trafficking and war and drugs and so on, I must be incredibly depressed, and I’m actually not,” Kristof said. “Part of it is that when you go out and cover these issues side-by-side by the worst, you see the very best.”
At the end of the event, many attendees purchased their own copy of “Tightrope” directly from the authors themselves.
“It’s time for a new version of the American Dream,” Kristof said. “One that includes everybody.”

We’ve all been there. It’s midnight or later, and you’re sitting in the saddening Leavey Library when your stomach suddenly decides to break the monotonous silence with an embarrassing growl. Or, if it’s a weekend, the munchies may very well have gotten the best of you after a night out with friends. 
Next comes the frustrating realization that most fast food restaurants and quick eats are closed for the night. But, don’t have sleep for dinner just yet! Here’s your all-inclusive list to the best, most convenient and most affordable late-night eats on campus and within Fryft distance.
El Huero
Honestly, El Huero was a saving grace my freshman year. A 24-hour walk-up stand serving Mexican food, El Huero is conveniently located close to the Row, offering build-your-own burritos, nachos and plate combos. The stand also has plenty of vegetarian options, which can easily be made vegan, and the staff is always accommodating to various dietary restrictions. Though the stand also offers burgers, onion rings and other traditional American diner foods, El Huero is most known for its burritos, which hit — especially at 2 a.m. after a shitty frat party.
Taco Zone
Located on North Alvarado Street, this Mexican food truck is popular among USC students. Open until 2:30 a.m. most nights and 3 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays, Taco Zone exclusively caters to late-night eating. With vegan and vegetarian options, this food truck is incredibly affordable and accessible for all. Many Zone-goers it’s the perfect night-cap after a night out and about. 
Trojan Grounds Starbucks
Located right next to Leavey Library, the TroGro Starbucks is the sole beacon of hope and consolation available to students as they cram for that one midterm they really should have studied for earlier. It also happens to be the perfect on-campus eatery after a night out, with a beckoning, while oftentimes chaotic, energy right off the EVK Fryft drop-off location. From coffee pick-me-ups to pre-packaged snacks to baked goods, this Starbucks has it all. Just make sure you don’t stop by during the crucial yet often-forgotten closing time from 2:30 to 3 a.m. I have pulled up to Trojan Grounds one too many times ready to feast (if you can call it that) only to stare helplessly at the paper sign and begrudgingly head back to my dorm. 
Spudnuts Donuts
Open 24 hours, this donut shop-deli hybrid needs no introduction. Infamous for its late-night appeal, as evidenced by its cultural relevance on the USC memes Facebook page, Spudnuts is a staple for USC students. While I personally have not experienced the glory that is Spudnuts (don’t crucify me), it is known for its affordable, flaky donuts. Spudnuts’ six-donut-holes-for-a-dollar deal is a steal. The shop also serves breakfast sandwiches all day, and sometimes (OK, most times) breakfast at 2 a.m. is exactly what you need. But make sure to stay away from the boba; you’re better off going to Pot of Cha instead.
Postmates, Uber Eats, Grubhub, DoorDash
Why go anywhere, honestly, especially if you’re busy doing homework or can’t seem to move after having finally made it back home on a Saturday night? Postmates, Uber Eats, DoorDash and Grubhub offer convenience like no other late-night snack or meal. While usually at a higher price point than the aforementioned eateries, these food delivery services are a great once-in-a-while splurge for college students on a budget. Make sure to take advantage of the occasional promotions and codes the apps offer for cheaper dining and recommend them to your friends to get credits for the pricey delivery fees!

“There are so many cool things happening in L.A. all the time, and I just stay in my room,” said my housemate as we passed a flyer pinned to the bulletin board of a Mexican restaurant near Union Station. His statement was painfully relatable.  
The advertisement described an upcoming art show of some sort, featuring local creatives at a small venue downtown. In a rush to get back to campus, neither of us snapped a photo so we could remember to attend the event, but the posting reminded us of all the shows happening around the city, underground or otherwise. 
The city of Los Angeles has at least five cool local art events happening every night. If you sign up for newsletters like We Like L.A. or check out websites like DoLA and Time Out Los Angeles, you’ll see an abundance of activities to check out. One can become overwhelmed looking at all the possible Friday night plans, giving Angelenos a problem opposite of what some small-town folk experience: too much happening, not enough time. 
When overwhelmed, it’s a lot easier to just lay low and stay home than to choose what to do. I fall victim to this problem myself, clicking “Interested” on four different Facebook events for concerts happening on a Saturday. Wanting to go to all of them, I sometimes choose to go to none, refusing to pick a favorite by avoiding picking at all. 
Outside of deciding on weekend plans, we face this dilemma all the time. We live in a world of information overload, of breaking news every 15 minutes, of thousands of tweets posted a second. Instead of making a choice to explore the new and unknown, we tend to stick to what we know, what is comfortable and what we have already been exposed to. At its worst, we can tumble down rabbit holes of extremist ideology, surrounded only by like-minded folks and unable to consider the opinions or needs of others. At its most OK form, we rewatch “Gossip Girl” for the fourth time instead of streaming a new show (or, you know, going outside). 
I’m not saying that staying home and relaxing is not a completely respectable use of your time. Do what you need to do after a long week! Treat yourself, take a nap or binge some TV. But, there is a difference between relaxing and being too lazy to go out and experience something new, especially something in the local art scene. And I don’t want to be lazy!
When I first came to USC, I wanted to do everything: make friends, join clubs, explore L.A. and go to local concerts. When I was in high school, I was incredibly active in the young Bay Area music scene. Many of my friends were in bands, so I would go to their shows to support them from the crowd or photograph their gigs. I befriended the other musicians with whom they shared bills, building a robust circle of music friends. Those concerts quickly became some of my fondest high school memories. In turn, when heading to college, one of my biggest worries was not being able to find a music scene as good as the one I was leaving back home.
I can’t believe I was worried. I mean, c’mon, this is L.A. Once I opened the door, the music scene came pouring out.
My French class introduced me to Sophie Gragg of The Luna Collective. I started going to the house shows she would organize and discovered some USC talent. Eventually, I asked her for a list of local artists to check out, whom I researched or stumbled upon at other concerts in the area. After a while, I started discovering musicians myself. Friends, friends of friends, hours of mild Instagram stalking or Facebook event browsing introduced me to so many artists I now love and appreciate.
Once I was knee-deep in the local music scene, I felt like I was swimming. Typical of a freshman, I looked at the number of artists surrounding me with wide eyes, unsure of where to even begin with really “getting into” their music. But once I dove in, I was able to prioritize and manage the music I cared about. Eventually, I could pick between concerts happening on a Saturday night.
Deciding what music to dive into is kind of like choosing your major. When you apply to college, determining what you want to study can be a nearly impossible process. Even when you arrive at school, you can switch to other schools or programs until you decide what’s right for you. The process of choice seems like a lot at first, but once you go through the process of elimination — getting rid of what you definitely don’t want to study — choosing what to focus on feels a lot easier, right?
So, if you feel overwhelmed, it’s probably just the beginning. Do your research. Figure out what concerts and other local events make you excited, what makes you tick. Going to events that actually exhilarate you is so much better than going just for the sake of going.

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences has not been kind to German studies students.
Every semester, introductory German classes fill with curious new talents. But by the time students finish their language requirement and move into the upper levels of the German studies minor, many may ask why Dornsife initially accommodates students enrolled in German minors but increasingly falls short in providing adequate ways for students to further explore their interest in this historically rich nation. 
USC dropped its German major program in 2008. According to the Los Angeles Times, Michael Quick, the former provost who made the final decision to cut the program, expected the German studies minor to die out shortly after the change, but the program continues to serve students today. 
Our higher education neighbors, public and private, maintain healthy German major programs, and USC has fallen behind in this respect. UCLA has an active German major, as does Stanford. In an era when Germany is leading in alternative energy applications, the niche demand for German language instruction is only set to grow larger in the next 10 years. At USC, however, the German department is shrinking, and administrators are doing nothing to remedy this problem.
Students who wish to continue German education beyond the beginning stages established in the minor have two options: They can major in the recently added Central European studies program, or they can attend USC Dresden or Berlin study abroad programs. 
Telling students to study German abroad is misleading. For the Berlin program, USC’s partnership with the Institute for the International Education of Students requires that students take classes instructed entirely in German. Students who choose the Dresden program are encouraged to take humanities courses abroad. But if a student only has an elementary grasp of the language, they are likely to be steered toward countries where the majority of courses are offered in English. If USC reintroduced the German major, perhaps more students would continue language instruction beyond their school language requirement.  
If the lack of resources for German-language enthusiasts seems normal or even trivial, stop to consider how many Russian language undergraduates USC is accommodating this semester. The Russian language department currently houses 36 students in Russian levels one through five, with upper-division classes catering to individuals mastering the prose in Leo Tolstoy’s original texts. The major itself houses an astonishing four students. Meanwhile, German instruction stops after the fourth level, with stylistic and business German courses appearing periodically — every other semester at best. 
Given that fewer students take Russian courses than German and that the Russian minor is smaller than the bustling German minor, it is unclear why USC has not reintroduced the German major.
This is not a question of nonexistent funding or ability to support German scholars. The 2008 L.A. Times article states that Quick killed the German program due to its small size and aging faculty, but several members of the German department still teach at USC. 
In an age when the University holds valuable German texts and testimonies, USC needs German language skills and historical reference more than ever. With resources like the Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archive at Leavey Library and the Feuchtwanger Memorial Library in Doheny Library that houses special collections from German exiles,  there is a clear demand for German language resources at USC. 
Understanding these resources demands a working knowledge of German texts and the nation’s history. It is embarrassing that USC should serve as a steward for these resources without encouraging students to learn the skills they need to access the information available at their fingertips. Denying students a German major discourages opportunities for all to engage with a linguistically and historically dense nation. But the conversation does not stop there. 
While USC offers students alternatives to the German major through its program in Central European studies, there is still a wealth of other languages and cultures that do not receive representation in Dornsife. Although the Central European studies curriculum claims to cover cultures and peoples across the region, there is an exclusive focus on German and Russian history. 
Students are interested in learning about conflict in Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia. Perhaps survey results would show that there is a strong demand for courses covering current events in Latvia, Lithuania and Belarus, or that students are interested in courses that cover relations in Central Asia. 
By ignoring selective regions in its course plans, Dornsife sends the message that it does not care about these countries and that students should follow suit and continue to pay these cultures no mind. This stance is unacceptable, and something must be done. Dornsife specialized, and look at where it stands now.

One of the main policies Sen. Bernie Sanders has focused his presidential campaign on is free college for all. His full plan calls for all public colleges and universities to become tuition free regardless of student income levels, as well as the cancellation of all outstanding student loan debt in the country. 
The proposal has significant backing, as a Hill-HarrisX poll on the topic found that 58% of registered voters support the proposal, including 67% of those polled who make less than $75,000 a year. Free college for all is certainly a popular idea, especially among those in lower income brackets, but it may not be the most sensible or comprehensive solution to the country’s education problem.
Fifty-five percent of students at public schools coming from families earning less than $35,000 a year currently pay no tuition, and of that same income group, 82% pay $5,000 or less per year. Meanwhile, 72% of public university students from families earning over $110,000 a year pay $5,000 or more a year in tuition. Thus, Sanders’ plan for free college, which is overwhelmingly supported by lower-income Americans, will give greater benefits to wealthier Americans.
Free college for all simply contradicts the main goal of the Sanders campaign, which is to redistribute America’s wealth and resources to the lower and middle classes. His plan will actually help upper-class kids the most because those are the ones who typically have the highest tuition bills. 
Furthermore, the government money that will be spent on wealthier kids’ education will take away from public spending, whether it be for low-income students’ financial aid, health care, infrastructure or the military. Regardless of where in the government budget it would go, instead of going to legitimate needs, the money will go to tuition that can be paid for by the families anyway.
Rather than Sanders’ counterproductive plan for fixing income inequality, what we need to address in our education system is a lack of alternative higher education opportunities and a lack of college readiness among poorer students. 
Contrary to what Sanders campaigns on, the main problem in American education is not an inability to pay for college but rather an inability to prepare our youth for college. It is widely known that inner-city school districts struggle with funding. Districts with the highest rates of poverty receive $1,000 less per student in public funding than the wealthiest districts. 
This inequality in public school funding leads to a lack of college readiness and opportunities for students in poorer districts. For example, only 27% of Los Angeles Unified School District graduates in 2016 went on to a four-year college and 36% went to a two-year college. Furthermore, proficiency rates in the Los Angeles Unified School District were 42.3% for English and 31.6% for math.
There needs to be an overhaul of our public education system, which includes making funding equitable across all districts. This will lead to more inner-city and lower-income students earning opportunities at college degrees and eventually higher-paying jobs, leading to a lessening of the income gap.
As a society, we also have to understand that not everyone prioritizes college, and in response, provide other options for students finishing high school. Instead of investing money in the upper class’ college education, we should fund more vocational and trade schools and apprenticeship programs. 
These programs will give people skills that they can use in the workforce right away and are viable alternatives to an associate’s degree from a community college. There are over 30 million jobs in the American economy paying an average of $55,000 a year that do not require a bachelor’s degree. Thus, why not provide cheaper, shorter educational options that provide skills for paying jobs? 
When it comes to college affordability, the government and private institutions like USC are certainly doing their part. Guaranteeing free college for certain income groups is a reasonable policy, but free college for all makes no financial or theoretical sense, especially from the viewpoint of Sanders supporters. Instead, we should focus on providing young Americans with as many higher-education opportunities as possible.
Sanders’ presidential campaign is fundamentally built on a vision of an America for all and is driven by supporters who want to decrease economic inequality and expand social programs. While some of his policies may benefit some in his supporter base, free college for all may simply be a good tagline and political ploy to gain voters.

In Fall 2017, former Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry announced a policy affecting students interested in joining an Interfraternity Council fraternity or Panhellenic Council sorority. To participate, incoming freshmen must complete a minimum of 12 academic units at USC, and transfers being eligible after completing one year of college coursework. 
According to the statement, the policy gives the “opportunity to provide incoming freshman students time to acclimate to college life and the community.” 
No other on-campus organizations are subject to this deferral of recruitment.
Deferred recruitment for Greek life has now been in effect for four semesters since its implementation in Fall 2018. Since then, these restrictions have offloaded the responsibility of protecting students through what can be recognized only as a veil of structural change.
USC must recognize the independence of students and their own responsibilities to themselves. Joining and dropping Greek life should be up to the student, and it should not be the University’s decision to tell them no.
Nonetheless, finding one’s way as a freshman is part of everybody’s experience, regardless of the path one chooses. Most organizations that first years join offer support, resources and a community for students to identify with. And sure, the typical benefits of fraternities and sororities may be opportunities to network socially and professionally, which indeed can be found in many other clubs. However, sororities and fraternities elevate these experiences and resources and leverage the capabilities of the individual in their professional and professional networks. 
As what Carry called “an instrumental part of the USC experience dating back to 1889,” the administration’s poorly-executed policy eliminates choice from the student body. By explicitly targeting Greek organizations in IFC and PHC — not multicultural, pre-professional or religious Greek organizations — the administration does not consider the time-consuming activities of not only other non-social Greek organizations, but all other organizations and their potentially negative effects. The Trojan Knights, the Trojan Marching Band, and numerous other organizations often have intensive — or even superior — time commitments when compared to those of IFC and PHC organizations. This explicit focus is indicative of campus prejudice against Greek organizations.
Because of the policy, first years have one semester to form an opinion on Greek life. Therefore, they are more likely to observe what can be referred to as “incongruent behaviors,” wherein as they are not members of Greek life, they are more likely to form negative assumptions, altering their true perspective on Greek life.  
This then associates the character of these organizations with a raft of negative characteristics. When first years begin to observe values-congruent behavior, like the philanthropies and fundraisers that fraternities and sororities frequently host, perspectives begin to change. Pigeon-holing Greek life like the administration and campus media has done, further promote this negative phenomenon, and for Greek life to rid itself of its stereotypes — that are largely upheld by campus media and administrators — openness is key.
Moreover, these restrictions, which affect how many students are eligible to rush in a given semester, can be considered increasingly financially discriminatory  because it adversely affects those chapters that already need more members to be financially viable due to turnover, graduating seniors or other factors. When this is combined with other guidelines like security guard requirements for events, the pressures that have been placed on Greek life — including the loss of seven chapters since 2014 — clearly delineates the administration’s future intentions regarding Greek life.
Of course, as a member of an IFC chapter, it’s often hard to imagine how some people may fail to recognize the good things that fraternity and sorority members do for the community. The academic, athletic, social and philanthropic achievements that have been achieved by USC’s Greek life are extensive. 
According to the IFC website, 884 members work more than 10 hours a week and 1,948 are involved in two or more student organizations. It was reported in 2015, the all-Greek average GPA was, since 2010, in fact higher than that of all undergraduates, with the exception of one semester. Carry’s implementation of the deferment policy was intended for students to adjust and figure out personal priorities. These statistics, although limited, delineate some of the key priorities for those in Greek life at USC: campus involvement, professional development and academics.
Students in Greek life have been historically held to stricter standards, but it is imperative to ensure that these students are treated equitably in comparison to students who are not in Greek organizations — this protection should thus extend to chapters themselves and their recruitment.
Given that the new administration has done little to signify its intentions for the Greek community, it is important for the conversation to be continued against deferred recruitment and in favor of actionable change to ensure the longevity of Greek life.

I never considered myself to be someone who practiced self-care. For a while, I turned to self-sabotage to cope with my depression and anxiety. The pressures and angst from my early adolescence consumed me, and the thought of being reckless always sounded more appealing than doing a face mask and watching trashy reality TV.
Then, I grew up a little. Don’t get me wrong, I sometimes still succumb to the idea of getting so drunk that I can’t remember my name or where I came from, and I still have unhealthy coping mechanisms that I try to escape from every day. But what changed wasn’t my ability to practice self-care; instead it was my mindset surrounding the act of self-care. I had to come to terms with the fact that self-care is not only viable and effective but also imperative to mental wellness.
There are many misconceptions surrounding what self-care is and isn’t. Self-care can be anything from lighting a sweet-scented candle to wind down after a long day to cutting off a long-winded toxic friendship. Like anything else related to mental health, there is no “right” path, and everyone’s journey is different and specific to them. What may help a person on their self-care voyage may have the opposite effect on another. That is where the misconceptions of self-care lie.
The question remains — how do you find what’s right for you in practicing self-care? Sadly, the answer isn’t as cut and dried as we’d all hope it to be. It takes a lot of self-reflection, time, experimentation and sometimes even research to discover what works best for you. It may be as simple as dedicating 10 minutes of your day to meditate, or it may be as complex as coming to the realization that you need to change your living situation. 
Again, there’s rarely a formula for self-care that is synonymously effective for all people. This is because we are all unique human beings with different life experiences, routines and goals. I stress this aspect of self-care as my early-adolescent misconception that self-care was a sort of “one-stop shop” that led me down the dark route of self-sabotage. I had tried what was advertised as self-care, and when these strategies didn’t aid in easing my anxiety or depression, I threw my hands up and said, “Oh well!”
My point is that self-care must be practiced on a daily basis in order to see positive outcomes. Just as it is with breaking a habit, forming one takes time, effort and consideration. An attempt at self-care may fail, and that’s OK. Understanding that your expectations for self-care won’t always come to fruition is part of the journey toward wellness. You have to understand what doesn’t work for you to find what does.
So, where do you start? Again it’s not always as simple as it may seem — but it can be. I started my pursuit of self-care by identifying the small things in life that distracted me from all the so-called “noise” that can accompany stress and mental illness. In hindsight, I realized I had been practicing self-care on the microscale for years. I had formed little habits that eased my depression and anxiety — healthy little habits — and all it took to understand what they were was self-reflection.
For me, it started with taking a bubble bath and lighting a scented candle — something I had loved to do for years but rarely ever practiced. To make this an act of self-care, I dedicated one day a week where I would block out the time to do it. 
The results were pretty staggering. I actually began to feel less stressed, anxious and depressed after months of implementing this into my weekly routine. It started to become something I looked forward to, despite being such a small act.
I am still searching for more ways to practice self-care. The most important detail that I’ve learned throughout my self-care journey is to not compare what acts of self-care work for me to those that work for my friends. I also learned to go easier on myself as an act of self-care. Understanding that you are only human and that being human requires taking care of yourself is vital. 
Self-care doesn’t need to be a super calculated effort. It is specific to each person and boils down to an act that is grounding and freeing from the stresses of everyday life — even if it’s only effective for a short period of time. 
It is a conscious act that needs to be implemented into everyday life to be effective. With that said, it’s not as daunting as it may seem. Once you start consciously implementing one aspect of self-care into your daily life, your journey towards self-love and self-care will flourish. I promise.

After five months of intermittent harassment, the USC fondler was finally stopped — for a few days, at least. Earlier this month, his bike-and-grab ended in a chase that reads more like a “Fast and Furious” fanfiction than a Department of Public Safety Crime Alert mass email. 
The offender was booked by the Los Angeles Police Department for seven similar cases of sexual battery related to USC, having been identified by victims of the string of earlier incidents on and near the University Park Campus. 
This was definitely a win for female butts all over. However, the absolutely ridiculous length of time it took for DPS to catch him — twice, since the issue was marked as resolved Oct. 11 with the initial detainment — doesn’t help the department’s already disputed reputation of inadequacy and downright misconduct. And to top it all off, an unconfirmed 14th case of sexual harassment was filed last week by DPS, matching the circumstances and description of the USC fondler.
Inadequate? Corrupt? To all the card-carrying members of the National Rifle Association, don’t bring out those AR-15s just yet. These are some big claims that are important to break down.
Feb. 11, 2019: A black man was stopped more than a mile north of campus by DPS officers for riding his bicycle without a light. They handcuffed him and asked about any outstanding warrants — completely unrelated to the supposed purpose of the traffic stop — and after relaying his history of a dismissed warrant, the officer said that another officer from the Southwest Division would have to come to confirm. 
Oct. 11, 2019: A woman walking home through the Row was tackled to the ground by DPS officers after she hugged a tree on a sorority’s lawn. Both her and her accompanying friend were arrested, and her bike seized and returned damaged.
Eight days later, during the homecoming tailgate, the Black and brown fraternities and sororities of Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega Phi Beta, Lambda Upsilon Lambda were fenced in and kept under heavy policing by both DPS and LAPD officers, with the occupancy capped at a number far below what was possible for so many organizations. 
During the Fall 2019 semester, a total of five hate crimes occurred on campus according to USC Annenberg Media, and DPS has so far only commented on two. One instance, on Oct. 18, consisted of a racial slur that was written on a whiteboard on a student’s door. The other incident, on Nov. 19, a “Keep America Great” sticker was found on the apartment door of four Muslim women living in the Nemirovsky and Bohnett Residential College.
The hypocrisy at work here is astounding.
DPS is the “Department of Public Safety” — yet it is unclear who the “public” is that these officers are protecting. Not students of color, who face discrimination from their own peers, administration and the officers themselves. Nor the large population of students whose innate privilege shields them from any consequences their actions may incur. And definitely not the residents of South L.A. who have the misfortune of living within the 2.5-mile patrol zone. 
Outside the campus bubble, people of color are shot down every day by trigger-happy police drunk on a cocktail of power, prejudice and fear. That’s not to say all police are monsters. This is not an N.W.A. song. However, for every honest, hardworking cop who has not shot an innocent civilian because of racial prejudice, there are more who have — or will. 
Like all universities, USC functions as a microcosm of the outside world; as such, it seems to have inherited all the same problems. In this exponentially smaller environment with centralized administration, such obvious discrimination should — in theory — be easier to correct. But this  is not the case. 
Ultimately, the actions of DPS rest solely at the feet of the University administration. President Carol Folt has failed to ameliorate the Department’s relationship with either the students of color or the local community. The situation may in fact be worse because the same acts of injustice are committed under the guise of this so-called “new” USC, which Folt claims to have birthed. 
It’s important to establish that this is not an argument for the dissolvement of DPS though there indeed is one. This is a call for reform — for increased awareness and some semblance of accountability. Perhaps a dab of humility — but that may be too much to ask.

It’s Nov. 2, 2017 and the Houston Astros have just won their first World Series championship since joining the big leagues in 1962. After years of languishing in the trash heap of professional baseball’s worst teams, the Astros are now champions and the living embodiment of why perseverance and sticking to a plan pays off. 
Fast forward a couple of seasons. It’s now Feb. 26, 2020. We are a month away from opening day and the Houston Astros, having since been exposed as cheaters, are the most reviled, universally hated professional team in American sports. 
Listen, I’m just as tired as you are of reading about the Astros. Since the The Athletic detailed in November how the club electronically stole signs during their World Series run, it feels like anyone with a column, podcast or Twitter account has felt the indomitable need to share their thoughts on the scandal. It’s a really disheartening, shitty revelation about cheating at the top levels of American sports, and it also just so happens to be an incredibly apt allegory for American politics today. 
So let’s get to it. In 2011, Jim Crane bought the Astros for $680 million. Like another prominent businessman whose name will be revealed shortly, Crane faced a slew of undesirable allegations, ranging from bigotry, sexism and systemic discrimination at his business to price-fixing and even profiteering off the Iraq War. 
In case it was not already hopelessly obvious, I will now be discussing another businessman whose wealth is exceeded only by his sheer lack of morals — Donald Trump. 
On Nov. 9, 2016, Trump won the United States presidency. Like Crane, Trump had a checkered past of his own. During his 2016 campaign, Trump mocked a disabled reporter, proposed a plan to ban all Muslims from the United States and attacked a Gold Star Family. These events were paired with a near constant stream of xenophobic rhetoric and the release of a now-infamous audio-type in which Trump brags about sexual assault. 
Just to further reinforce the comparison, Trump’s businesses shared a similarly disturbing record as Crane’s with numerous allegations and reports of bigotry. Would you look at that — the two were made for each other!
I could go on, but the main point is that these spineless schmucks both entered into their respective positions with plenty of controversy and questions to answer, and just as their reputations suggested, both of them have gone on to be just as feckless— actually exceptionally more feckless — than any of us expected. 
Upon taking over as owner of the Astros, Crane made good on some promises to embark on organizational overhaul. In many respects, the overhaul went well: The Astros were successfully rebuilding, their staff was diversifying and the team’s 2017 World Series title effectively elevated them to the position of baseball’s standard bearer. 
Unfortunately for Crane, the facade began to unravel when an Astros executive taunted a group of female journalists in the clubhouse last fall. The executive, Brandon Taubman, did so by repeatedly yelling at the journalists how happy he was that the team signed Roberto Osuna, a pitcher who had previously been arrested for alleged domestic violence against the mother of his child.
Crane’s team defended Taubman and accused one of the journalists of fabricating the story. Then came the aforementioned cheating. 
Though MLB’s investigation has described the Astros sign-stealing scheme as player driven, the Wall Street Journal reported that the team’s front office laid the groundwork for cheating by creating an application called “Codebreaker” to decode opposing catchers’ signs. By doing this, the Astros cheated the Los Angeles Dodgers out of a title, tarnishing opposing players’ legacies and the integrity of America’s pastime in the progress. 
Trump’s list of misdeeds, failures and faux pas is too long to recount here, so I’m going to focus specifically on his cheating. Last summer, only months before the Astros’ facade unraveled, Trump attempted to coerce a foreign government into investigating one of his political rivals. 
Then, during the same time frame that the Astros’ image crumbled, so did the foundations of American democracy, when Trump successfully convinced Republicans in Congress to block every key impeachment witness. 
To make matters worse, the allegory isn’t only limited to the Astros. According to The Ringer’s Michael Baumann, the persistence of scandals like the Astros’ seems to be reflective of a modern societal trend toward brazen dishonesty — with teams all over the world joining in the new “golden age” of cheating. 
In the same vein, Republican politicians across the country are cheating. From gerrymandering in North Carolina to suppressing minorities’ votes in Georgia, it’s as if Republicans have abandoned religion because it’s become overwhelmingly clear that they need Jesus. 
You want another parallel? I’ve got one coming right up. In January, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred announced that all players interviewed in the cheating scandal would be granted immunity. Less than a month later, Trump pardoned 11 criminals guilty of a range of crimes from corruption to tax fraud. 
I actually can sympathize with Manfred in this situation: He’s a former labor lawyer looking out for players’ interests. Trump is a feckless dirtbag doing favors for his close friends at Fox News. 
I would like to highlight a shred of hope in all of this, but honestly there isn’t one right now. The Astros currently have the third best odds of winning the 2020 World Series, and Trump has even better odds of winning re-election (yes, you can bet on that). 
Never has America’s pastime more closely resembled America’s nightmare.

The USC women’s basketball team will play host to Utah and Colorado at Galen Center this weekend. The Trojans currently sit at 14-13 on the season and hope to improve their chances of making the NCAA Tournament with a pair of wins over the two teams. 
In Friday’s matchup against the Utes, USC will face a familiar foe. The Trojans’ last matchup with the Utes ended in heartbreaking fashion for USC: The Trojans hung with Utah despite a seemingly unstoppable barrage of 3-pointers before ultimately falling 67-65 at the hands of a last second basket. 
The Utes were led by an excellent performance from redshirt senior wing Daneesha Provo, who had 17 points to go with three buckets from behind the arc. Freshman guard Kemery Martín also chipped in 12 points for the Utes. 
Both teams shot the ball exceptionally well, combining for 20 3-pointers over the course of the afternoon. 
USC was led by a career shooting performance from sophomore guard Desiree Caldwell, who finished the game with 14 points after sinking four 3-pointers on just seven attempts. 
Caldwell believes containing Utah’s shooters will be key to more success on the defensive end this time around. 
“Urgency to the shooters is what our coach has been preaching,” Caldwell said. “Everybody’s a shooter on both Colorado and Utah, so just getting to them with a lot of urgency and try to make them alter their shot.” 
Standout freshman forward Alissa Pili heads into the game averaging a team-high 15.6 points and eight rebounds per game on the season. Pili recently enjoyed a career-high 32-point scoring performance during a 66-60 win in Pullman, Wash., against Washington State. 
Pili’s strong scoring performance against the Cougars was complemented by 12 rebounds, good for her 10th double-double of the season. 
Over the last 12 games, Pili has averaged a stellar 19.7 points per game. Pili is the Pac-12 freshman leader in rebounds and scoring and looked more and more like a rising star each time out for the Cardinal and Gold. 
In her first career meeting with the Utes in January, Pili led the Trojans with 16 points along with eight rebounds. In that same game, five Trojans scored in double digits — the first time that had happened all season. 
Associate head coach Aarika Hughes said she and head coach Mark Trakh expect everyone who plays to be ready to share the burden of the scoring load given the extra attention they expect Pili to receive. 
“Alissa Pili is driving us right now,” Hughes said. “She is our scoring force. We want to give her just as many looks every game, but everyone needs to be ready and willing to knock down shots and have that confidence because the coaching staff believes that they can do that as well.”
Utah travels to Galen Center with a bit of momentum after snapping a three-game losing streak with a home victory against Arizona State Sunday. The Utes currently sit just under the Trojans in the Pac-12 with an overall record of 13-14, but the teams share conference records of 6-10.
Whether Utah attempts to implement the same high-tempo strategy it used against ASU or if it tries to slow the game down with halfcourt sets, USC expects to be prepared for whatever the Utes bring. 
“We definitely are fine with playing at a fast pace,” Caldwell said. “But if we do get a half court situation, we know that we can execute our offense. So either way, we’re ready to battle.” 
Hughes echoed Caldwell’s sentiment. 
“Clearly, the goal is to get out and run and slow the other team down,” Hughes said. “Utah is an offensively focused team. So slowing them down in transition and matching up and slowing the game down on the defensive end is crucial.”
USC will face Utah at Galen Center Friday afternoon and Colorado at noon Sunday. Friday’s tip-off is at 6 p.m. Sunday’s tip-off is at 12 p.m.

The USC men’s basketball team has gone 6-7 in its last 13 games after starting the season 13-2. With only three games to go in the regular season, the Trojans have a big test this week against Arizona and Arizona State. The Trojans, who are  11-2 at Galen Center, will be playing at home for the rest of the season.
USC is now in sixth place in the Pac-12 standings after being as high as first earlier this season. With Arizona and Arizona State both ahead of the Trojans in the conference, USC will need to start making some noise down the stretch.
While the Trojans have not played well as of late, head coach Andy Enfield is keeping the focus on his player’s health.
“We were just worried about our guys and their health,” Enfield told the Los Angeles Times. “Obviously we want to make the tournament, but we were just worried about our guys. We weren’t thinking about [the tournament].”
The Trojans will first face the Wildcats Thursday in a whiteout game for Trojan fans. The Wildcats will enter the showdown hot, having won six of their last eight games. Arizona nearly beat the No. 14 Oregon Ducks in a 73-72 overtime thriller Saturday.
In their previous matchup earlier this month, the Wildcats beat the Trojans 85-80 in one of USC’s higher-scoring games after the Trojans rallied from a 20-point deficit. If the Trojans have any hope of beating the Wildcats this time around, they will have to do a better job of starting out strong.
Arizona freshman forward Zeke Nnaji has been one of the team’s most productive players this season. Scoring an average of 16.3 points per game and shooting over 50%, Nnaji has been a player that opponents have had difficulty containing. 
On the other hand, USC has its own share of high-flying freshmen. Forwards Onyeka Okongwu and Isaiah Mobley have put pressure on their opponents on both ends of the floor. Okongwu has averaged 16.7 points this season while Mobley has averaged more than five rebounds per game. The freshman duo has been a strong point for USC through almost every game they’ve played.
Likewise, veteran senior guard Jonah Mathews has been a leader for USC. The captain has had a strong season this year, scoring 360 points — the second most on the team — through an average of 31.8 minutes per game, more than any other Trojan. Mathews also has 22 more 3-pointers than any other Trojan at 60, and he will need to show up against Arizona after scoring just 6 points against the Wildcats in their last meeting. 
USC will then take on the now-first-place Sun Devils in a game Saturday at 5 p.m. Though the Sun Devils have a 10-4 conference record, they are not nationally ranked. 
Still, the Sun Devils have shocked many Pac-12 teams this year. Riding a seven-game winning streak, ASU has shown no signs of slowing down. The Trojans almost gave the Sun Devils their ninth loss of the season earlier this month but lost 66-64 after giving up a 13-point lead.
One player the Trojans have to look out for is junior guard Remy Martin, who has led the Sun Devils in points this season with 517 and minutes with 902. In addition, he is third on the team in rebounds with 88. 
USC hopes to avenge its losses this week as it aims to secure a top-four seed in the Pac-12. By doing so, they will receive a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament. Furthermore, the end goal for the Trojans is to make the NCAA Tournament, an appearance that has eluded them in three years, and their recent loss to an underwhelming Utah team certainly didn’t help their odds. 
“It’s tough to reckon with,” Mobley told the L.A. Times on the Trojans’ latest woes. “But we just have to keep fighting. The season isn’t over yet.”
Currently on the bubble, USC has gone back and forth between the first four in and first four out for the NCAA Tournament according to many experts. College basketball analyst Andy Katz has USC as the No. 10 seed in the East division in his latest bracket prediction. If the Trojans can steal impressive wins against Arizona and Arizona State and follow that with a win over crosstown rival UCLA, they could solidify their spot in March Madness.
“If we win those three games, then all will be well,” freshman guard Ethan Anderson told the L.A. Times.
The Trojans will begin the crucial weekend against the Wildcats in a 7 p.m. tilt Thursday at Galen Center.

I was 10 years old when I faced racism for the first time in my life. And I still remember it vividly. 
Growing up Muslim American, I frequently encountered stone-cold glances or looks of disapproval, but it wasn’t until the fifth grade that I experienced overt racism. It happened during a school field trip to the annual Children’s Water Education Festival in Irvine. My peers and I were eating Subway for lunch when a young boy from another school looked at me and yelled, “Terrorist!”
My hijab — a headscarf  — was enough for him to instantly judge and label me as something I’m not. So many emotions flowed through me in that very instant. I was shocked, but confused. Angry, yet sad. Disgusted, though helpless. Feelings beating against each other, I mainly concerned myself with understanding why the boy called me that. Spending the next few days and nights pondering why, my young simple-minded self gave up. 
It wasn’t until I read Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird” in the eighth grade that I truly started to comprehend the boy’s hostile behavior. Published in 1960, Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel follows the story of a child’s view of race and justice in the South. I learned alongside Scout as her father, Atticus Finch, taught her to be a morally responsible person. Enriched in wisdom, Lee’s prose contains life lessons applicable to any day and age — taking form in the words of Atticus. 
On almost every page, I cultivated a new understanding of ethics and morality from my literary hero. But, the greatest lesson I learned from him came in the third chapter when Atticus enlightens his daughter with unforgettable insight regarding judgment. 
“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view,” Atticus said. “Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.”
A snippet of a larger conversation, Atticus explains the importance of understanding others before judging them in terms that both Scout and I could understand. Struggling to put his advice into practice, Scout ultimately succeeds in living with empathy as she grasps and accepts her neighbor’s perspective near the end of the novel. Like Scout, I applied this suggestion to my pressing questions regarding the boy’s remark. I realized there was no justifiable answer: His comment came from a place of judgment and ignorance. I told myself that he probably didn’t know any better.
I came to the conclusion that there wasn’t anything I could do to change what he said, but I could choose to grow from the experience. Though the boy hadn’t given an extra second to view things from my perspective, I knew I wouldn’t do the same. I chose to give him the benefit of the doubt and not blame him for being ignorant. And if he was, I hope that he learned to be tolerant toward others. So to the boy who judged me before knowing me (whoever you are), I hope that you have now learned to think before you speak and belittle others but, more importantly, know that I forgive you. 
Acquiring the skill to climb in and walk around in someone else’s skin before reaching a conclusion is a lifelong journey — one I invite everyone to embark on. 
Judging others is habitual: We judge and are judged constantly. Various studies, time and time again, demonstrate how frequently individuals both judge and misjudge people based on appearance and actions without giving time to understand their behavior. A 2016 study by Allure noted that 80% of people surveyed agreed that everyone judges other people’s looks. Even though the study emphasizes that being judgemental is an innate human characteristic, I believe there is a greater problem of us being narrow-minded. Oftentimes, we don’t accept differing viewpoints, stunting our ability to understand varying perspectives. 
At USC, I’ve seen how dangerous and cruel unjust judgments can be. From the Fluor flooding incident in which Latinx students received racist comments to untrue rumors containing hateful rhetoric against particular presidential and vice presidential campaigns that were spread around during USG elections, most — if not all — of us have either judged others without empathy or have been on the receiving end. We are all victims of living in a society that welcomes bias and judgment. 
And I say we change this.   
Beyond making snappy judgments, we must commit to doing what Atticus taught Scout. It’ll take time and patience to replace our behavior of judging others with understanding other people’s perspectives. Nevertheless, this life lesson is invaluable and one that has the power to greatly enhance the lives of many. So tomorrow, try walking in someone else’s shoes before jumping to conclusions. And the day after, work toward viewing a situation through another’s eyes before belittling them. 
Taking it day by day, I encourage us all to stop judging a book by its cover.

Every Sunday afternoon, members of USC’s gospel choir gather to carry on a rich, 20-year history. 
They invite God into the Fishbowl Chapel in the University Religious Center. They discuss roses and thorns or Bible verses, rehearse for their semesterly concerts and worship together. They wrap up rehearsal with a prayer circle where each member crosses their arms, holds hands with their neighbors and shares their prayers and accomplishments. This final tradition is as old as the group itself. 
Established in 1998 by alumna Tanesha Roberts, Saved By Grace is more than a choir — it’s a ministry that spreads the Christian message through music. Its name comes from Ephesians 2:8: “For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God.” 
Creating tradition
The idea for the choir group began with an epiphany that Roberts had while on exchange at Howard University in 1997. One of her classes emphasized the importance of taking action for change, and Roberts said she realized she needed to act on USC’s lack of a gospel choir. 
“I remember thinking after that lecture, ‘When I get back to USC, I’m going to do whatever it is I need to do to start a choir,’” Roberts said. “That’s all I wanted.”
As a student worker at the religious center who hailed from a family of pastors, Roberts spent a semester using her experiences to plan out the choir before launching it in the fall. She put up flyers and put ads in the Daily Trojan that caught the eye of alumna Rachel Whitlow, the choir’s first music director. 
Whitlow agreed to curate and teach the music. By then, she was working professionally as a background vocalist and had directed the Western Baptist State Convention Choir, which has over 100 members. But the founding members were still nervous about Saved By Grace’s reception. 
“We had our first rehearsal and we had, I’m sure over 50 people of all races and nationalities come out to the first rehearsal and meeting, which was amazing,” Whitlow said. “We didn’t know how many we were going to get. And from there, we] just kind of took off.” 
That year, alumni Tiffany Commons and Jonathan Long met at USC’s Midwest orientation in Chicago, and both decided to join the group before setting foot on campus. Long, a transfer student from Indiana University where he’d been a member of several choirs, introduced a prayer circle tradition to the choir. 
“I was really shocked and taken aback that they still maintain that tradition,” said Long on attending the 20th anniversary concert in 2018. “It was just something that I didn’t … even think about but it was something that still stuck with the choir.” 
The instant success of the choir continued as the group’s mission and music resonated with diverse groups of students with different ethnicities, church backgrounds and experiences with music.
A Close-knit community
Current Saved By Grace president Aqua Richards, a junior from Atlanta majoring in biochemistry, spoke about the significance of gospel music to the Black community, but also of its universality. 
“The soul that comes out through gospel music … is really important to Southern African Americans,” Richards said. “My parents are from West Africa and they don’t really have gospel music, but in Georgia, it’s totally different. The sound is very upbeat [like a] sunny place … I think people really like that.” 
Initially a student organization of the religious center, the group is currently a member organization of the Black Student Assembly. Laylah Fairley, a sophomore majoring in architecture, is Saved By Grace’s BSA representative and, in addition to promoting their events, occasionally sings with the group. 
Fairley emphasized the group’s close-knit nature, stating that many will book the same flights home for winter break, often to Georgia or Louisiana, where Fairley is from. The camaraderie created from shared experiences manifests during rehearsals as they share songs from home.
“Some of us, we are from the same area, so sometimes we’ll be going through a song and they’ll be like, ‘Oh I’ve never heard of this song,’ and the others will be like, ‘Oh yeah, I know this song! I play this song in my church all the time, what are you doing?’” Fairley laughed. 
Bengy Mitchell, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he enjoys the shared cultural experience of the gospel most as a new member. 
“There’s a lot of nostalgia and homeliness and comfort to gospel music,” Mitchell said. “When you’re here [at USC], you don’t really have a lot to grapple onto … I think these things have brought me closer to home … and it’s reminding me how important my religion really is to me.” 
All aforementioned members and alumni, including alumni Valerie Sun and Jason Gooden, spoke on the importance of singing about their relationship with God. As Sun described it, gospel music gives the singer permission to sing as loudly as they’d like, to express their spirituality however they want and to have fun. Contemporary and lively, the gospel’s music is usually performed with a band of volunteer Thornton students. 
Lasting Legacy
Regardless of post-graduation choices, Saved By Grace and gospel music remain significant pillars in all of the member’s lives. Alumni of the group have pursued music and leadership roles in faith.
Among the most notable former members are Jojo Villanueva, the senior vice president for music creative affairs at Sony Entertainment, and Ashley Támar Davis, a professional singer and former background singer for Prince. Roberts and her husband are co-pastors for a church they founded. 
Sun bumped into a Saved By Grace alumnus and former classmate in her neighborhood the morning of her interview with the Daily Trojan and said she couldn’t believe the coincidence. After 20 years of being apart, they fell right back into conversation, and Sun said the comfort between all members through the choir is something that transcends age, major and race. 
“[Saved By Grace] invited me to the alumni event,” Sun said. “I’ll get up with the choir and it’s great, I’m 18 years old again.”
Alyse Watson, the current music director and a senior majoring in theatre, is now preparing for the group’s Spring 2020 concert. The concert’s theme is “He’s Able,” and her favorite song selected was one she directed, “Grace” by Ricky Dillard and New G. 
As Roberts, Whitlow and other alumnae reminisced about their time in the choir, there was one particular memory that stood out. The Spring 1999 choir, which had upwards of 40 members, booked Bovard Auditorium for that semester’s concert. The group prepared skits, dance choreography and matching camouflage outfits in addition to singing with the live band. 
Twenty years since that performance, Roberts spoke warmly of the group’s legacy and hinted at a possible reunion. 
“I’m more than happy to connect back with the choir, anything that they want or need,” Roberts said. “I’m there for support and I’m thinking about bringing back [original members] for a re-enactment of our spring musical [in the near future] because we had so much fun.”

Northwestern University professor Aymar Christian spoke on his research in TV representation and the challenges broadcast media creators face with content independence. The research analyzes the inequity often faced by marginalized creators associated with TV providers. 
More than 25 students attended the event Tuesday, which was held as part of the Annenberg Innovation Lab’s Civic Media Speaker series.
Christian, a communication studies associate professor, decided to create Open Television, a media channel that gives creators the freedom to make content aimed at audiences who want shows with more diverse representation. The platform functions as a hub for intersectional pilots and series that follow the events of queer or underrepresented characters. Christian recognized these shows as examples of the goals that OTV hopes to achieve in enforcing diversity. 
“You’re not only just consuming these images of women of color, but you’re supporting them in their diversity of their artistry,” Christian said. “It’s very, very real material and ‘audience-experienced.’”
Christian said he wants to increase diversity in media and provide a platform for Black and queer people to create more authentic shows audiences can relate to.
Affiliating with TV networks limits showrunners’ freedom to regulate their own projects, Christian said. Because of this, he said he wants OTV to be a form of broadcast media that shifts more creative liberty to TV show creators and appeals to a diverse audience such as through the show “Brown Girls” that features two Black women leads. 
Christian also said content providers such as Netflix and YouTube limit creators by restricting or excluding queer representation. In his research, he found that the lack of diversity on Netflix is due to the lack of diversity in Hollywood leadership. 
Christian said streaming platforms are unable to properly meet audience’s interests in representing minorities. 
“They’re not actually drawing from a labor pool that’s representative of their global distribution capacity and the richness of the consumer choices and experiences,” Christian said. “These inputs are not reflective of this audience.”
With OTV, Christian said he wants to create media centered on intersectionality, equity, justice and participatory action research. OTV benefits creators by encouraging them to reflect stories of minority communities, Christian said. 
Amai Wayans, who identifies as Black, lesbian and nonbinary, said inclusive media has helped shape her identity and that she appreciated that OTV created more inclusive broadcast media.
“Coming to terms with a lot of my marginalized identities has been found through finding these queer and [people of color] creators online, especially on YouTube,” said Wayans, a sophomore majoring in creative writing. “It’s nice to see that there’s more than just that and that we’re hopefully getting somewhere in the entertainment industry in regard  to representation.”
Christian encouraged other media makers to make a difference and change the state of TV production.
“I want [students] to be energized about making media more equitable because it’s hard work,” Christian said. “It’s underappreciated and underfunded, so I hope it was a bit of a pep talk to get them to remind them that they have the power to change media.”

Every Tuesday and Thursday, students sit in a circle inside Shrine Auditorium to write and rehearse lines with formerly incarcerated people, rehearsing for “Performing Policy: The Justice Project,” an open-ended play that discusses criminal justice conflicts that will be performed in April.
As part of “Performing Policy,” students work with felons who bring their lived experiences to theater performance, deepening students’ understanding of the penal system by allowing them to explore a scenario of restorative justice. Restorative justice is a form of criminal justice that explores reformation rather than punishment through communication between victim and offender. The play purposefully presents conflicts without offering solutions, challenging audiences to reach restorative solutions.
Launched last January, the project aims to reform the criminal justice system by giving incarcerated people opportunities to heal and deal with their issues through theater rather than suffering for the actions they may have carried out unintentionally or unknowingly. 
“This methodology brings the power of narrative, of playwriting, staging and performing into the hands of the people who are most affected by the story,” said Brent Blair, a leader of the project and a professor of theater practice in voice and movement and head of Theater and Social Change. 
It encourages victims and their perpetrators to communicate through a medium that is beneficial and justifiable for both, Blair said. In many cases, those who are incarcerated committed crimes as minors and realize the gravity of their actions later, he said. 
“This movement encourages dialogue to be fostered between perpetrators and victims to try and arrive at some mindful conversation about what justice and restoration would look like for both,” Blair said. “How do you move forward to healing if you don’t let the two sides speak to each other?” 
Tobias Tubbs and Christian Branscombe, both charged and convicted of murder, are rehearsing with students to produce a realistic scenario for the stage. In 1991, Tubbs was convicted in aiding and abetting a murder-robbery. He pursued restorative justice in the aftermath of his crime and uses his experience to help write, rehearse and perform a production with the Justice Project.
“I was arrested as an adolescent,” Tubbs said. “I fight to change the laws of juvenile sentence, and now it’s known that our brains were not even formed enough to cultivate our adult minds, so we have to be given some form of relief or opportunity to prove our humanity and self-worth.”
Tubbs’ experience with restorative justice brought him closer to many people, including victims, and helped in his process of healing. 
“It took 30 years of diligence experiencing the penal system, but at the same time, I met some of the most enlightened, wonderful, courageous and bold people,” Tubbs said.
After receiving a grant from Arts in Action, Blair and his colleagues decided to further explore restorative justice through forum theater, a form of theater that explores social justice and solutions to oppression in a performance.
The project links the Price School of Public Policy and the School of Dramatic Arts in an effort to practice forum theater.
“I think the community partners — their stories and their commitment to making communities better — are really inspiring,” said Jocelyn Poe, a Price faculty member and leader of the project. “The ways they want to give back to the community and the ways that they have shared their lives and their stories with this project has been really inspiring.”
The work produced by 40 students this semester will culminate in a performance in which the audience is welcome to get involved. Viewers are asked to participate in the play and communicate with performers.
“It becomes a real forum,” Blair said. “The entire audience gets involved, not by watching the play, but by standing up, getting out of their seats and participating in the play.”
Blair said that part of the reason he and his colleagues are exploring restorative justice is because, despite having 5% of the world’s population, the United States is home to 25% of the incarcerated population worldwide.
Members of the class who wish to get more involved with the project are encouraged to work with Blair and Poe into the summer once classes end. Over the summer, the Justice Project will have discussions with individuals capable of reform, including Rep. Karen Bass. 
Blair said the project’s goal during the summer is to get Bass involved in the Justice Project and invite her to watch and join the performance  so audience members can ask her serious questions about reform. 
Poe hopes the project can raise awareness about pressing criminal justice issues and bring about solutions to them.
“I hope to see people really understand restorative justice and the implications of it and how to create good policies around it,” Poe said. 
Students who remain through the summer will perform a final production of the play “Legislative Theatre.” It will include legislative changes to the story, that Blair hopes will enable “healthy dialogue and reform.”

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed a resolution to establish a First-Generation Plus Center during Tuesday’s Senate meeting. The resolution would create a physical space for first-generation students to build community and gain access to vital financial and advising resources. 
A survey conducted in Spring 2019 by the First-Generation Student Union and QuestBridge executive board revealed establishing a first-generation resource center and lounge is a top priority for 90% of respondents. Targeted professional development and increased funding for academic opportunities not included in financial aid packages also ranked at the top of respondents’ priorities. 
According to FGSU Programming Director Jennifer Jimenez, the resource center will recognize the cultural, ethnic and economic diversity present within the first-generation student population. 
“A lot of campuses throughout the nation focus either on first-generation or low-income population,” Jimenez said. “This center will definitely not only focus on the low-income population but on other socioeconomic classes.”
The First-Generation Plus Center will centralize and streamline resources specifically targeted toward first-generation students such as the First-Generation Mentor Program and the FGSU. The center will also feature a lounge space for individuals to gather and build community and will be professionally staffed to provide programming services and general oversight. 
The resolution encourages the University to maintain constant communication with its first-generation students and will ensure a timely establishment of the resource center. 
Sen. Randi Anderson presented her work on decreasing the carbon footprint of Thornton School of Music by converting to paperless alternatives. The initiative aims to establish a pilot program in Fall 2020 that will provide electronic tablets to use during students’ academic and professional careers. 
“Essentially, what I wanted to do was use iPads for performance settings, [for] music and [to] do things in rehearsal digitally so we can reduce the amount of paper waste that we are putting out,” Anderson said. 
Anderson also commented on her efforts to reduce faculty paper consumption by suggesting professors provide digital alternatives to paper packets and smaller handouts. 
Sen. Haley Garland presented her work with Sen. Sara Khoshniyati on an initiative that would allow students to use discretionary dollars at USC Village businesses. Garland will meet this week with Assistant Vice President of Hospitality Kris Klinger to work through the barriers the initiative faces.
Garland then presented her continued work with the Association of American Universities’ Task Force to gather campus data on sexual assault cases. Garland also attended the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine action collaborative to develop methods for decreasing sexual assault on campus. 
Senior Director of Communications Truman Fritz announced the launch of the Humans of SC campaign, which will document student voices from various cultural backgrounds to advance campus unity and diversity on Instagram. 
President Trenton Stone presented amendments to the USG constitution that condenses the document and reflects the recent change to consolidate the government structure under three main branches instead of six.
“All the amendments will take effect April 7 at the start of the new term,” Stone said. “We’re doing a lot of this now so that [Fritz’s] and [Ritch]’s hiring can reflect the changes that will exist in the organization.”
Senior Director of Programming Montana Houston confirmed new Service Student Assembly Co-Executive Director Isabella Oh and Assistant Director Samantha Sparacino. Oh, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, will serve as Director of Publicity and Social Media on the SSA executive board. Sparacino, a freshman majoring in human development and aging, will serve as Director of Community Affairs.
The USG Election results were also verified by Director of Campus Activities Gabriel Valenzuela who confirmed Fritz and Ritch as USG’s 2020-21 president and vice president. The USG 2020-21 Senate will comprise of Isabel Washington, Dario Arganese, Trinity Moore, Alexis Areias, Mayra Rodriguez, Max Gomez, Lennon Wesley III, Ruben Romeo, Kevin Gutierrez, Cathy Ding, Gabriel Savage and Julian Lin.

Hot Pockets heiress Michelle Janavs was sentenced to five months in prison Tuesday for her involvement in the college admissions scandal. Janavs paid $300,000 to falsify her two daughters’ ACT test scores and help her oldest daughter gain admission to USC as a false beach volleyball recruit in 2018.
Federal prosecutors initially recommended a 21-month prison sentence for Janavs’ involvement in Operation Varsity Blues along with three years of supervised release and a $175,000 fine. Janavs was sentenced to two years of supervised release and has been fined $250,000, according to a release from the Department of Justice.  
Janavs pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Janavs’ defense filed a memorandum in court Thursday requesting probation in lieu of prison time, citing Janavs’ generosity and compassion. The memorandum quoted character references solicited from Janavs’ friends that portrayed her participation in the scandal as out of character. In the document, the defense stated that admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer convinced Janavs that partaking in it was the only way to secure her daughter’s admission to college.
According to the memorandum, the University rescinded Janavs’ oldest daughter’s offer of conditional admission and prohibited her from ever reapplying. USC said it was unable to comment on the status of her daughter’s admission or relationship with the University, citing student privacy laws.
Janavs’ oldest daughter withdrew from the other schools she applied to and enrolled in a community college, the memorandum stated. Both she and her younger sister were prohibited from attending events at their private high school after the scandal was released, and her sister enrolled at a public school.
Janavs began working with Singer in 2017 to falsify her oldest daughter’s ACT score. Her daughter took the exam at the West Hollywood Test Center, where Singer’s designated test administrator and proctor gave her extended time and corrected her answers. Her application to USC the following year included the falsified test score, according to court documents. Janavs also sought admission for her daughter as an athletic recruit. 
Court documents indicate that former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel presented her athletic profile to the admissions subcommittee, falsely describing her as the winner of several California beach volleyball tournaments. Her daughter played indoor volleyball in high school but did not play competitive beach volleyball, according to court documents.
Janavs also falsified her second daughter’s ACT score in 2018 after applying for extended time and paying Singer’s test-taker to correct her answers. The younger daughter, who was a junior when the scandal was made public, did not submit her ACT score to any colleges, according to the memorandum. Former assistant women’s soccer coach Laura Janke will be sentenced in April for falsifying athletic recruitment profiles for seven college applicants, including five to USC. Prosecutors recommended a sentence at the lower end of the federal sentencing spectrum, according to the Department of Justice.
Five other parents involved in Operation Varsity Blues at USC have been sentenced since the scandal broke in March. Former Pimco executive Douglas Hodge was sentenced to nine months in prison earlier this month and was fined $750,000 for paying $850,000 to secure four of his children’s admissions to universities, including USC, as fake athletic recruits and attempting to secure his fifth child’s college admission. Of the 36 parents named in the admissions scandal, 19 have ties to USC.
