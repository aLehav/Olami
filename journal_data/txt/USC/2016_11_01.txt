#NeverTrump, but #NeverEverHillary. As a conservative Republican voter, I have always believed in the values of fiscal responsibility, cultural traditionalism and small government. Unfortunately for me and other like-minded voters, neither of the major presidential candidates this election cycle truly embodies any of these values. While it is abundantly clear that Hillary Clinton is an anathema to everything that I hold dear; Donald Trump is also quite lacking in these departments. It goes without saying why I would refrain from voting for Clinton on Nov. 8. She favors further government intervention in the economy, is an embodiment of the establishment status quo and has a record mired in corruption and scandal. What isn’t quite as apparent is my reasoning to not vote for Donald Trump. 
While I understand that many on the right would find it reasonable to vote for Trump on the basis of saving the Supreme Court or appealing to the lesser of two evils argument, I still cannot support a man who, in my view, would pervert the public’s perception of conservatism for at least a generation should he take office. A man who favors protectionist tariffs and government-run healthcare, while espousing an ambiguous and ill-informed foreign policy, should not be the prime representative of the party of Lincoln and Reagan. In addition to his lack of conservative credentials, he presents a wildly unpopular and repellent face to the party that I would like to see succeed in future elections. It would be quite astounding that the most unpopular presidential nominee in modern history is even in the running to win if it weren’t for the fact that the Democrats nominated their own train wreck of a candidate to represent their side via Hillary Clinton. 
While not overly controversial to many of his supporters, a good number of Trump’s comments in regard to Latinos, women and Muslims have tainted the Republican brand among many moderates who might have otherwise supported the party. As a millennial Republican, I look toward a new generation of conservatives that empower minority communities to achieve the American Dream and champion women’s successes. It’s elected officials, like Republican California State Assembly member Ling Ling Chang that are taking the lead in promoting STEM education and championing young women to reach their full potential that give me hope for more diversity within our party. It’s time for the Republican Party to shed its skin from the Trump campaign and move toward a new era of Conservatism. In our democracy, one of the greatest fundamental rights is the right to vote. However, within our right to vote is a right to abstain from voting in a presidential election if the electorate believes that neither candidate is suitable. I will not be complicit in falling in line with my party, which maintains that party matters more than principle. In order to bring progress and a new light to our great nation, it is sometimes necessary to divert from the status quo. Whatever the outcome on Nov 8., Nov. 9 begins the dawn of a new era for the Republican Party, one that doesn’t include Donald Trump.

On Friday, electronic band Tennyson, indie-rock band Yeasayer and indie-electronic music group M83 performed at the Greek Theater. Tennyson, a Canadian brother-sister duo, opened the show with Luke Pretty on keyboard and Tess Pretty on drums. Throughout their performance, the music group showcased their instrumental abilities accompanied by their recent foray into lyrical invention. 
Luke Pretty especially engaged the audience with “Fault Line,” from their EP Like What. Percussive trills from his performance on the xylophone complemented the song. The lyrics, upon a return to the chorus with, “Why can’t we escape / You and I could leave this all behind / Now is not too late / I know we can get it right this time,” underscored the chemistry between the two. They moved along to the beat and smiled through the music with such synchronization and ease that it came as a surprise when Tess Pretty revealed their “stage fright.” Nevertheless, Tennyson’s talents exceeded their limited resume, leading Yeasayer, who followed, to say that the duo “tore it up” on stage.
Bookended by two electronic groups, it would have been easy to get drowned out by reverie from the same vein. Instead, Yeasayer held their own, presenting some of their old favorites and new ventures.
Formed in 2006, the Brooklyn-based band featured their setlist in an almost chronologically influenced fashion. One of Yeasayer’s first performances, “Madder Red,” demonstrated the exuberance of rock bands from the 1970s, like Led Zeppelin or Kansas. With “Never gave a thought to honorable living / Always had sense enough to lie / It’s getting hard pretending / I’m with your time,” audience members could feel the nomadic spirit in the piece. Later, “O.N.E.” and “Sunrise” evoked influences from 1980s rock groups. 
The energy from Yeasayer’s act transferred over when M83 took the stage. The French group opened with “Reunion,” a fitting piece as this year marked the band’s reassembly after a five-year hiatus with Junk. 
The audience felt the remarkability of the band, on stage together again, as well. As lead singer Alex Gonzalez sang, “There’s no more single fate / You make me feel myself,” fans responded with the chorus as a fluorescent light show pontificated the beat. 
Songs that followed highlighted the multifaceted talent of each band member. Gonzalez, the lead singer, was a triple threat, playing bass and keyboard in other sets. He riffed with guitar player Jordan Lawlor, who also provided vocals in addition to drums. Kaela Sinclair, the most recent addition to the band, lent her vocals to songs such as “Oblivion.” As the background synth swelled with “And in your dreams you’ll see us falling, falling / And in the night you’ll hear me calling,” Sinclair personified a range not unlike Grimes or Joanna Newsom.
The most beautiful presentation came with “Wait.” The song, popularized by the movie The Fault in Our Stars, featured a performance from an interpretive dancer who followed the somber tone of the music with the contortion of her body. “Wait” lacks lyrical density, so the presentation of the dance, with drummer Loïc Maurin’s acuity, elevated what otherwise could have been a stale production.
Of course, when the opening of “Midnight City” — the single that catapulted M83 to stardom in 2012 — blared across the amphitheater, the audience roared with excitement. The song was particularly special, since Gonzalez found the inspiration for the piece from observing downtown Los Angeles at night. The lyrics “Waiting for a word / Looking at the milky skyline / The city is my church / It wraps me in a milky skyline” were then aptly sang before a midnight blue backdrop.
After concluding their set, the group came back after the audience demanded an encore, with “Moon Crystal,” “Couleurs” and “Lower Your Eyelids to Die With the Sun.” The pieces were completely instrumental and featured the M83 members completely in their element.
And with that, M83 left the stage for good, concluding a show that was all about the music. Each act, from Tennyson to Yeasayer to the headliner M83, was completely dedicated to staying true to their sound. The result was a show with no frills that stirred the audience no less.
“alex gonzales”??? who fact checked this?

This week’s poems are about falling for someone and the intense feelings that are associated with a growing relationship. More importantly, they are about the connection between two people who care for each other. These feelings are not only sexual, but also spiritual and emotional. When you are falling in love with someone, there comes a point where that person becomes an extension of you. They know more about you than anyone else, and vice versa. You care about that person and will do anything to make him or her smile. Knowing that you have that person in your life is intoxicating and can sometimes become distracting. However, the intoxication and dizziness never controls your life. Instead you ease your way into familiarity and those feelings become normal and controllable. You crave to know so much about him or her, and eventually, you do. Soon the person’s presence always seems to linger throughout the day. The relationship is intoxicating, but it only drives you to sustain it because that person illuminates your future. He or she becomes the reason why you work hard in your everyday life and becomes what you look forward to every morning.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Los Angeles it’s that people absolutely love coffee shops. The city has a variety of shops, and each has a unique vibe. It seems like all of these places are full of trendy, L.A. locals writing screenplays and drinking matcha. The area surrounding USC doesn’t have the largest selection of coffee shops, so I often go off campus. I’ve spent a lot of time researching options and finding the best study spots. Over my two years at USC, I’ve discovered some coffee shops with great vibes that definitely help increase my productivity. These shops remind me that going to school in Los Angeles has its benefits. Below is a list of my five favorite spots.

Blue Bottle – Culver City 
This coffee shop is a short twenty minute metro ride away from USC. It is located in a shopping center called The Platform. Blue Bottle itself has a wide variety of seating options. You can sit on the stairs, at a table outside or on ottoman seats upstairs. Blue Bottle has great coffee and a variety of delicious pastries.

Dinosaur Coffee – Silverlake
This Silverlake coffee shop is bright and well-decorated. As for study space, there are small tables out front, one communal table in the back, and some elevated spots at the coffee bar. The coffee here is high quality and they also offer an assortment of baked goods.

Groundworks – Santa Monica
Groundworks in Santa Monica is one of the best study spots for people who want to get out of South Central. Without traffic, it’s about a 20-30 minute drive. You can also take the metro here. Groundworks is a small coffee shop, but they have a large collection of drinks and food. Their drinks menu is extensive and includes organic teas and lemonade. Their food menu has everything from grilled cheese to poke bowls.

Verve – DTLA
If you want a close L.A. coffee shop, look no further than Verve Coffee Roasters. It’s a hip study spot with a communal table, small tables along the wall and outside work space. It has a great atmosphere, and a wall outside is fully covered in live vegetation. Along with coffee, Verve offers food and juice.

Blu Elefant Cafe – DTLA
This is a cozy cafe decked in wall art and other vintage decorations. The cafe has a bohemian vibe that will make you forget you’re in the middle of downtown. If you’re looking for a fun and different place to crank out homework, try Blu Elefant.

Photo from Marvel StudiosScience rules · Doctor Strange is a superhero film based on the Marvel character of the same name. The movie, directed by Scott Derrickson, features actor Benedict Cumberbatch as protagonist Stephen Strange.
Doctor Strange, the highly anticipated Marvel film that will premiere on Friday, has already received acclaim among critics. However, there is more science to the film than meets the eye. Astrophysicist Adam Frank held a phone conference to discuss his work as a science consultant for Doctor Strange, answering questions from college newspapers nationwide. 
The biggest focus of the conference was the presence of scientific and philosophical concepts in Doctor Strange, as well as how these elements can broaden the minds of audiences without sacrificing the fantastical elements of the source material.
As a superhero film with both scientific and mystical elements, Doctor Strange was a multifaceted project for a science consultant to tackle. Nevertheless, Frank’s accepted the position from director Scott Derrickson due to his interest in issues of science and spirituality as well as his lifelong love for Marvel. 
Frank’s work consisted of making comments on the script and discussing everything from specific scenes to philosophical ideas with Derrickson, writer John Spaihts, and producer Kevin Feige.
Frank emphasized that one of Doctor Strange’s prominent characteristics is its presentation of various scientific and philosophical ideas. Through its medium, Doctor Strange was able to visualize exciting concepts that expand on scientific theory, such as that of the “multiverse” and the folding of space and time. Scientifically minded films like Doctor Strange, Frank claimed, help broad audiences become acquainted with challenging theoretical concepts.
“The representation is really a place where the art comes in,” Frank said. “Art is going to have to really lead the charge to giving us creative representations for things that, unless you’re a mathematician, you really can’t see —and when you see it as a mathematician, you’re seeing it through the lens of mathematics. But here, what they did in the film was create a version that anybody could see.”
These captivating visualizations are also important, Frank said, for their abilities to spark a person’s curiosity and even cause them to develop a lifelong interest in science. Frank himself was motivated as a child to study astronomy because of movies and comics; he cited the exciting covers of his father’s pulp science fiction magazines as a major influence behind his interest in learning more about the world.
“These movies can go beyond being just superhero movies,” Frank said. “Doctor Strange has that possibility of getting people to think about, for instance, the nature of consciousness and the maps that we use to represent the world and where those maps are partially incomplete.”
Doctor Strange in particular not only has the potential to pique interest in science, but it also introduces audiences to scientific philosophy. The particular viewpoint related by Doctor Strange is “emergence,” the idea touted by cognitive scientist and philosopher David Chalmers that an entity, such as a human being, exhibits properties beyond those of its smaller components. In fact, Frank spent more time talking to the filmmakers about philosophy, consciousness and individual experience than fact-checking the script for scientific accuracy.
“The open question here was really a philosophical question,” Frank said. “It’s the question of the nature of consciousness, or in philosophy what we call the mind-body problem. We often talk about science in the Marvel universe, but here was a place where explicitly we could touch philosophy.”
Frank also claimed that science fiction in particular has played pivotal roles in predicting future societal trends. He cited William Gibson’s 1984 cyberpunk trilogy Neuromancer, which foretold today’s cyberwarfare and coined the term “cyberspace.” Works of fiction such as these exemplified how creative minds can influence scientific and technological fields through fiction.
“William Gibson was not a computer scientist at all; in 1982, there were barely even dial-up modems,” Frank said. “But from that, he imagined the world that we live in now. Good science fiction not only educated the public, but it also creates the universes that we end up living in.”
Frank ultimately asserted that the main purpose of a fictional work is to tell a good story. A good story is one that incorporates science in a way that is consistent with its own world. For instance, Star Trek frames itself in a way that lends itself to an extension of science, whereas The Martian has the duty to be more scientifically accurate because it seeks to reveal what would actually occur if a man were stuck on Mars. In this way, fiction can be scientifically faithful without sacrificing the fantastic qualities of their world. 
“This is what’s important for movies: it’s that they have respect for science,” Frank said. “They have respect for the scientific process, they represent that process and that excitement and that promise well. They represent it in a way that does homage to what science has given us … I want a good story where the science is incorporated in a way that is thoughtful.”

Photo from Hedwig on BroadwayBreak a leg · Based on the John Cameron Mitchell novel, the Tony Award-winning musical Hedwig and the Angry Itch will be led by former Glee star Darren Criss and Lena Hall in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch’s nationwide tour kicked off on Oct. 2 in San Francisco, a year after the Broadway production came to an end. This year, the Tony Award-winning musical will be playing every night at The Pantages from Nov. 1 to Nov. 27.
Hedwig and the Angry Itch first began as a novel by John Cameron Mitchell, with the lyrics and music by Stephen Trask. The song plays off of the premise of the play in which Hedwig, the main character, must receive a sex change in order stay with her current lover. The sex change is botched and leaves Hedwig with an “one inch mound.” 
The novel was originally inspired by Mitchell’s babysitter named Helga, who was also a prostitute. Although his babysitter was biologically a woman, Hedwig is a not known as a transgender character but as a genderqueer character who uses feminine pronouns.
“She’s more than a woman or a man,” playwright and lead actor John Cameron Mitchell said in an interview with the Toronto Star. “She’s a gender of one and that is accidentally so beautiful.” 
The play is a full-length musical that collaborates variations of rock and punk music. It first opened off-Broadway in 1998. 
Many Broadway hits such as Hamilton and Rent originally started on Off-Broadway before becoming critically acclaimed plays. Hedwig and the Angry Inch was no exception. It ran for two years off-Broadway and included multiple casts and toured around the United States. 
The musical went on to win the Obie Award and Outer Critics Circle Award for best Off-Broadway Musical. This led to multiple adaptations worldwide after including locations such as London and Berlin. 
Mitchell then later transitioned the play into a full-length feature adaptation with Mitchell reprising his role as Hedwig. The film was acclaimed and won the Best Director Award as well as the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival. 
After multiple international stints, Hedwig and the Angry Inch had its first Broadway debut in 2014 with How I Met Your Mother star Neil Patrick Harris playing the role of Hedwig along with Tony Award-winning actress Lena Hall. 
The Broadway production ended in 2015 and is now starting its national tour with Darren Criss, known for his role on Glee, in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Hall will reprise her role for a few days at the Los Angeles show. The play will be directed by Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer and will run throughout the United States until the end of summer 2017. Criss and Hall, however, will both leave the production after the Los Angeles leg is finished.

This weekend, I revisited one of my favorite movies, Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris. For a large part of this stressful midterm season, my happy place has been sitting in front of a Netflix show with a tub of ice cream, free of responsibility. But after watching the film again, I have traded that vision for one of Paris.
I’m not sure if it was Signey Bichet’s “Si Tu Vois Ma Mere” accompanying the opening scenes or Allen’s soft, lomographic direction that inspired my rosy-colored wonder, but right now, I’d do anything to traipse the Champs-Élysées or spend a day at the Louvre Museum. And like Gil, the film’s main character, merely walking down the cobblestone streets would inspire me, as my idols, literary giants and artistic geniuses of the early 20th century, once made the city their playground.
Putting aside potential adventures in the City of Lights for now, I sought to hold over these experiences with ones in Los Angeles. I first visited a charming brasserie called Little Next Door, the sister restaurant to the fancier The Little Door. Located in West Hollywood, the restaurant, upon entering, displays prominent French decor, with its mosaic tiling, royal blue walls and stained glass. The open patio seating also adds to its laid-back vibe — one dinner party even brought along their dogs.
Most of the menu was tantalizing, especially the steak-frites, a classic French dish. I was also intrigued by the “hambourgeois” just for the name, but in the end, I settled on the fettucine. The plate came with a simple assembly of artichokes, tomato confit, olives and parmesan cheese on the side. Unlike heavy, creamy pasta, this dish, with a generous serving size, presented light flavors that complemented one another and left just enough room for post-dinner coffee and pastries.
At Little Next Door, I ordered a mixed berry fruit tart, and even though the fruit toppings of the dessert were fresh and delectable, it did leave me craving for macarons. With six locations throughout Southern California, ‘Lette has some of the best macarons I have ever tried, though we’ll see with the opening of Laduree early next year. Nevertheless, for now, ‘Lette’s Little Tokyo location provides easy access to students looking for a cheaper alternative to the macarons at Bottega Louie. I much prefer the flavors I usually get — vanilla, Earl Grey and salted caramel — at ‘Lette as well.
Inspired by all the good food I was surrounded by, I decided to channel my inner Julia Child and visit a French marketplace in order to recreate the Little Next Door’s menu items. Ten minutes away from the restaurant, located at the Grove’s farmer’s market, is a store called Monsieur Marcel. The market has a local, mom-and-pop-shop feel, and is stocked to the brim in wines, cheeses and pasta. It’s definitely a great place to check out for culinary creations, but halfway through I became overwhelmed by the process of actually cooking for once, so I left empty-handed and a future visit to Little Next Door already planned.
In the end, I always thought back to theme of Midnight in Paris, when Gil realizes that though his nostalgic tendencies shaped him into the dreamy writer he is, it romanticized his worldview, leading him to avoid living in the present. I know that I’ll always have Paris, but for now, I have to live in my present in L.A.

Photo courtesy of Sports InformationGo green · Sophomore Justin Suh and the men’s golf team defeated Georgia Tech in the final round of the Cypress Point Classic on Tuesday to take first place. The final score was 19.5 – 4.5 in favor of the Trojans.
While the No. 12 men’s golf team found itself competing under different circumstances this week, Trojan golfers managed to salvage a triumphant finish in their most recent competition. 
The invitational was played on the world-famous Cypress Point Club course, and the teams competing participated in a match-play scoring system — not the traditional stroke-play scoring system. 
The Trojans dominated No. 29 Georgia Tech — by a score of 19.5 – 4.5 — in the final round of the Cypress Point Classic, held in Pebble Beach on Tuesday to pick up their first team victory of the season. 
The two-day tournament included three rounds of golf — 54 holes in total — all of which were scored in different fashion. The first and second rounds were played Monday, and had teams divide their rosters into duets to play Four Ball (best ball) and Foursome (alternate shooting) rounds of golf. The final round, which was played on Tuesday, had golfers compete in singles matches. Teams could score a total of four points on each 18-hole match played throughout the invitational — two points were awarded for winning a match, and an additional point would be awarded to the best scorer from the front-nine, and the back-nine holes, respectively.
In the championship round against the Yellow Jackets, USC excelled in its singles matchups. Five of the six individual golfers for USC on Tuesday won their singles matches against opposing Georgia Tech golfers. 
“Match play is a lot different than stroke play … As coaches, we try not to change too much of the way that we are playing normally because of the different format, sometimes you can read too much into it, and suddenly all the experience you have goes away because you are trying to reinvent the wheel,” head coach Chris Zambri said. “By looking at the way the matches went and asking [the golfers] about their scores, it felt like everybody was performing well.” 
Redshirt senior Andrew Levitt and freshman Cheng Jin both swept their respective singles matches Tuesday 4-0 as a part of USC’s championship-clinching victory over Georgia Tech. 
“To see us take 19.5 of a possible 24-points in [Tuesday’s] match means that we were obviously all playing pretty well as a team,” Levitt said. “We didn’t start the season off so hot, but everyone’s been playing better and better as of late, and it feels great for us to go out there and pick up our first win.”
Juniors Sean Crocker and Jonah Texeira played significant roles in USC’s winning performance at Cypress Point. As a tandem, Crocker and Texeira nearly swept Alabama (taking three-and-a-half of a possible four points) in the first round. In the second round against UCLA, Crocker and Texeira swept the Bruins’ opposing tandem, 4-0. As individuals in the final round of play on Tuesday, both Crocker and Texeira came away with victories in their singles matches.
To advance to Tuesday’s final round, USC defeated both Alabama (9.5 – 2.5) and UCLA (6-6, took the tiebreaker) in the first and second rounds, respectively, on Monday. 
“We did win, which is great, but to see us do it in stroke-play will really help us see where we are as a team,” Levitt said. “I think that individually, everyone is now starting to really play better.”
The team will return to competition on Nov. 7-9 in Napa for the Gifford Collegiate.

Nick Entin | Daily TrojanBigger and better · Junior three-way player Adoree’ Jackson became USC’s all-time leader in kick return yards on Saturday against Cal. Jackson is projected to be a first-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft.
It feels way too early to already be saying this. It’s just speculation at this point, and nothing about USC football is ever that predictable. Besides, you may even be staying in town over Thanksgiving break to watch the Trojans’ final home game against Notre Dame.
But this Saturday will likely be the last time most students get to see junior three-way star Adoree’ Jackson play in a Trojan uniform.
The ever youthful and energetic Jackson is now beyond the halfway point of his junior season. He has the talent and athleticism to be playing in the NFL right now, and I have to believe he will forgo his senior season to go pro. The nostalgia for me is already starting to set in.
I faintly remember covering Jackson when he was still in high school at Junipero Serra, a powerhouse Southern California team. He had four tackles, an interception returned for 25 yards, two punts returned for 110 yards and two catches for 26 yards when Serra defeated my high school, Harvard-Westlake, 35-8 in 2012 — his junior, my senior year.
When ’SC recruited Jackson, Serra had always been a steady source of talent for the USC football — think former USC wide receivers Marqise Lee and Robert Woods, or the other eight Serra products currently on the team. Jackson was a five-star recruit, rated the best cornerback in his class and best overall player out of all of California. 
Before Jackson committed, USC had offered a scholarship and gotten a commitment from his teammate Jalen Greene, Serra’s star dual-threat star quarterback. It seemed like a bizarre move — USC had only ever really recruited pocket passers, and Greene seemed to fit much better with a spread offense. But there was some speculation that it was all part of the effort to incentivize Jackson to join Greene — who has since converted to a wide receiver here — and the other Serra graduates. 
Sure enough, Jackson signed here on National Signing Day, passing up on offers from LSU, Florida, UCLA and pretty much every other school in the country.
The challenge for the coaching staff was to get him on the field as often as possible without wearing him out. He’s the first player to start a game on offense and defense since USC started keeping records on this in the ‘60s. Last year, he was in on 657 plays on defense, 157 plays on offense and 157 plays on special teams. 
He’s had plenty of exciting moments as a receiver on offense. Three of his 10 catches went for touchdowns his freshman year. He took a flat route 80 yards for a score at Arizona State last year; he took a screen pass 83 yards for a score at Notre Dame.
He’s been a stalwart on defense since becoming a starter as a true freshman. It’s easy to forget that his primary position is still cornerback given how exciting he is with the ball. But what makes him such a valuable part of the team, and a strong NFL prospect, is how well he can stop opponents from getting the ball. His best work on defense is the kind of stuff that doesn’t show up on the highlight reel or stat sheet, but even then, he still has his memorable defensive plays, like taking back a pick-six at Cal last year. 
But easily, the most fun part of Jackson’s game is his kick returning. There’s no better way to start off a game than having him set up deep to return an opening kick. After every defensive stop, I’m almost as excited to see him get a chance on a punt as I am to see the offense get the ball.
It’s hard to even keep track of every kick he’s taken all the way. He’s gone the whole 100 yards for touchdown on kickoffs at Utah twice — once in 2014 and once again to cue some major déjà vu this year. There was the punt that bounced all the way to our 21-yard line that Jackson picked up and took 79 yards for a score against Utah State this year. There were the two short field punt return touchdowns he had last year — a 41-yard touchdown return at Oregon and a 42-yard return to take the lead just before the half against UCLA. And of course, there was his touchdown to put ’SC on the board in the 2014 Holiday Bowl against Nebraska, when he took a kickoff 98 yards for the score, and capped off the return with a front flip. 
I’ve gotten to the point where the kicks away from Jackson resonate almost as much as the ones to him. When a punt by Arizona’s Josh Pollack sailed over Jackson’s head and bounced all the way for a 67-yard touchback three weeks ago, I felt like I had been cheated after driving 500 miles to see the game. When Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre started calling for Buffs kicker Chris Graham to start chipping short kickoffs away from Jackson in the second half, the wistful realization finally hit me — teams probably should, and probably will, start kicking away from such a dangerous return man going forward.
Even if they do, Jackson earned a well-deserved distinction last week against Cal. With his 56 return yards Thursday, Jackson became USC’s all-time leader in kick return yards with 1,779. The previous record of 1,723 yards held by Curtis Conway had stood since 1992.
There is of course the possibility that he stays for his final season, but it’s not like he has anything left to prove to NFL scouts. Fox Sports listed him as one of the seven “guaranteed” first round picks in the 2017 NFL Draft, before this season even started. I’d be thrilled to see him come back, but I’ll be just as excited to see him debut in the League. 
Maybe the most touching moment we’ve seen from this whole season was Jackson’s postgame interview after the Utah State game with his mother, who had been battling cancer last year.
“I wasn’t able to come to … games last year,” an emotional Vianca Jackson told reporters. “But God, He saved me in four months. He gave me back to my baby, so I can see every game and I can be the proudest momma.”
I’m sure she’ll be even prouder when she gets the chance to see him play on Sundays. Luckily for us, though, we still get to watch him play in the Coliseum at least one more time.

Alexandra Ting | Daily TrojanHave ball, will travel · Senior libero Taylor Whittingham and the women’s volleyball team begin a road trip on Wednesday against Arizona.
After splitting their most recent home games before heading out on the road, the women’s volleyball team looks to rest up and put the games behind them. With a long road trip this week, the Trojans hope to continue improving their level of play, despite their difficult schedule ahead. 
“I think we are only in school eight days in November,” head coach Mick Haley said. “That is two days a week basically.”
While it is easy sometimes to forget that these athletes are students, they certainly do not forget. Even with road trips, the student-athletes have to try and keep up with school work and find a way to maintain their academics in order to avoid the looming threat of academic probation that would keep them from playing. 
“We know that we are going to be on the road for a long period time,” senior captain Taylor Whittingham said. “That might be a struggle with homework, missing classes or stuff like that.” 
For the next two games against Arizona and ASU, the Women of Troy will have to be able to continue keeping their errors low, but will have to improve in their attack and their defense at the net in order to score points off of more than just kills and aces.
“The one thing going forward for the rest of this month that I would really focus on would be serving,” Haley said. “The second thing would be to continue to improve our team blocking. Those two things will help us as much as anything. “
However, the team has little time to practice before these games due to their traveling schedule. Traveling takes its toll on both players and coaches alike, but it will have to be overcome for the Trojans to continue to win games. 
“On Tuesday we travel, Wednesday we play and Thursday we travel to Tempe and will try to get a practice in there,” Haley said. “Then we play early Friday at 6 p.m., but we can’t get out that night, which is terrible because we have to get up early to get them back by 9 the next morning on Saturday.”
The key thing for this road trip will be rest. Without proper rest, the Trojans will be in a position for potential injuries and mental lapses during the games. Also, it is important that they get the rest they need this week, because they have another road trip the following week.
“I am trying to get them as much rest before we go to Stanford and Cal, which is the next hard trip,” Haley said. “I am really worried about those two back-to-back trips, because it has a tendency to really take its toll on their physical and mental prep.”
The women’s volleyball team will take on Arizona at 7 p.m. on Wednesday and ASU at 6 p.m. on Friday.

Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
I’ve been following the Standing Rock case for several weeks because issues of infrastructure, sovereignty and localism interest me. And I’ve been seeing the innumerable check-ins to Standing Rock, North Dakota, clutter up my Facebook newsfeed, and I have a few things to say to everyone doing that.
First off, you may have been bamboozled into a hashtivism hoax regarding the check-ins. According to the Los Angeles Times, the police out there aren’t actually checking the Facebook check-in application to disrupt protestors. (How would that even work, anyway?)
Second, you’ve definitely been bamboozled into a Kony 2012-like clickbait hoax. As CNN reported, it’s not as though the entirety of the tribe or even its representative leadership is out on the fields tussling with the police and guardsmen deployed out there. There would appear to be considerable disagreements within the Standing Rock Sioux nation over whether or not the pipeline ought to cross over their lands, and they are certainly not putting up a united front.
Rather, as the CNN article reports, a large number of the protesters appear to actually hail from out of the state and out of the country (and, presumably, not all of them have Native American blood.) Inspired by the likes of Bill McKibben and other editorialists, plenty of environmentalists have entered the scene to fight for a cause they believe in: opposition to fossil fuel energy expansion. It’s not so much an issue of tribal sovereignty now — though I don’t doubt that that was once part of the debate — as it is an anti-corporate, anti-oil crusade that uses the pretext of Native American opposition to spur wider opposition. (And like all anti-oil “popular” crusades, it’s driven in part by quasi-religious environmentalist sentiment and in part by people with lots and lots of money.)
Third, you are absolutely correct that there are problems with the route and construction plan of the Dakota Access Pipeline relating to safety, public health, traditional tribal grounds and other concerns. But responsible citizens of a democracy don’t go block construction and taunt law enforcement and endanger themselves and the workers on the project — they participate in the meetings and act as responsible stakeholders to make sure those concerns are addressed, which involves a lot of hard, unsexy, non-protest work behind the scenes. 
It may be that these and other options were exhausted by concerned members of the tribe and they felt they had no other recourse but to make a public spectacle. If that is the case, what’s happening right now is the result of irresponsibility on the part of the government and the Dakota Access corporation. But if that’s not the case, and the outside protesters came in with no intent of reaching a constructive agreement, and would accept nothing less than the unilateral disarmament of the pro-pipeline forces, then they’re guilty of creating a public showdown where none had existed before.
Fourth, there was absolutely negligence on the part of the energy and construction companies as well as the federal regulatory and permitting agencies in addressing the above-mentioned concerns, and all should be held accountable for it. But that doesn’t mean the project in itself is evil, pernicious and deserving of being halted. After all, look around the West. We do have Boulder, Hoover and Grand Coulee Dams, a continent-spanning spider-web of interstate highways and irrigation projects that water much of the arid side of the continent. When we built these megaprojects between the 1930s and the 1960s, all of the concerns surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline and more came up; but responsible stakeholders got around them. And these projects have been broadly beneficial to everybody involved and the nation as a whole.
I’m sure there’s plenty of complicated and misunderstood legal issues surrounding the Fort Laramie Treaty and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ judgment. We can also debate for quite some time as to whether or not new energy infrastructure should be opposed on principle to discipline human beings into energy austerity and eco-friendly consumption habits. And then of course there’s the grand narrative of white supremacy.
But there’s another narrative that fits in very well here — it’s the conflict between the American way of big-government state capitalism and democratic nation-building, best epitomized by President Abraham Lincoln’s legislative program and FDR’s New Deal, versus radical localist anti-government movements across American history, utopian on the left and populist on the right.
Dakota Access and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are merely continuing a grand tradition of public-private partnership for public works in the public interest. Infrastructure, including energy infrastructure, has historically been a big part of that. And the public interest is, more or less, a well-run American nation-state boasting a productive and diverse economy, capable of standing on its own on the world stage, and serving the interests of its free citizenry. In a word, big government for the public good. 
This is anathema to the pipeline protesters, who evidently think a social democratic state is compatible with and can be paid for by a non-state-capitalist economy and a low-productivity carbon-free economy. 
It’s also anathema to the gun-toting Malheur Bend anti-government militia who occupied a wildlife refuge in Oregon earlier this year. They, as a rule, don’t like big government or big anything. Not suggesting there’s moral similarity, but frankly, the Pipeline protesters and the Bundys are opposed to the same thing — the New Deal state.
Well, I stand firmly behind the New Deal state. And that means I’m not standing in front of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In a world riddled with deadlines and seemingly impossible study loads, the average college student is faced with constant feelings of uncertainty. Can I really get through midterms without feeling like a failure? In this same world, there are so many expectations students put on themselves to not only pass, but to excel, to essentially beat out all other competition. How does a young adult do this when they feel as though they are so easily distracted?
Adderall has become an increasingly popular new trend on college campuses. Though this is a medication usually prescribed to individuals diagnosed with ADHD, there is an almost normalized trade of this drug in college. A study published in the Journal of Brain and Behavior found that misuse of prescription stimulants was the second largest form of drug use for individuals in college, second only to marijuana. This can be extremely problematic due to the addictive nature of Adderall, which causes major shifts in the dopamine levels of a user’s brain, leading to an exceeded tolerance for the drug over time. 
Since Adderall is marketed to increase productivity, it adds yet another complication to the experience of the addiction. The experience of the high lasts long enough for the user to feel more productive, yet coming down from the high makes the user feel even more incompetent than before they took it. Thus, the user begins to think that they are not going to be able to perform without it, which contributes to the addictive attributes of non-prescription Adderall usage. 
First, we must demand a shift of attention to the problem of misused prescription medication. We must advocate for adding strict guidelines for repercussions to using Adderall without a prescription while being enrolled at USC. However, repercussions should not come in the form of punishments like expulsion or loss of financial aid eligibility. Rather, it should be in the form of seeing a series of professionals in the healthcare system that are willing to help individuals suffering from addiction to Adderall by offering them a program that brings them to sobriety. 
We must address the fact that misuse is not an issue of labeling, stigmatizing and criminalizing the students that abuse the drug. We are all capable of thriving without having to fall into the dangers of prescription abuse. We are better, and we deserve better.

If this election has taught our generation one thing, it is that young people are no longer just a demographic, but a political force. In the first presidential election to have as many millennial voters as baby boomer voters, we have already made history: bringing to the forefront of both parties’ platforms issues of college affordability and campus sexual assault. But now the time has come to not just push the course of history in the direction we see fit, but cast a vote that emulates the future we want to see. That vote should be for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
As college students, we stand on the tightrope between childhood and adulthood. We want our future to be shaped by hands that are calloused from 30 years of public service, and inspired by a voice that has stood up for the rights of women, children and all Americans alike. She is not our choice because she would be the first woman president. She is not our choice because she is simply an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump. She is our choice because she is willing to not only listen to the future the millennial generation envisions, but also change her vision to meet ours. 
Already on the campaign trail, following the massive millennial support for former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and his platform of debt-free college, Clinton heard us. She did not take her victory over Sanders in stride. She listened, she learned and she changed. Clinton has a comprehensive plan outlined as to how to improve college affordability, including free public college for students whose families earn less than $85,000, free community college, debt relief and refinancing options, as well as lowering the interest rates on student loans. 
Trump, on the other hand, has said students are “choking” on loans, yet offers little to back up how he would fix this problem. College affordability is a real issue, affecting all of us on college campuses. We successfully pushed it into the forefront of the election, so it is time we finished the job, picking the candidate that took it seriously enough to offer us more than empty promises.
Another issue we are faced with too often on college campuses is campus sexual assault. Just last year it was reported that nearly 30 percent of women at USC had experienced some form of sexual assault. That number is not only astonishing, but also cannot be ignored. Students should not have to compromise their safety to pursue an education, and Clinton has laid out an extensive plan for how she plans to provide support for survivors, key in on educational programs and provide a fair process that encourages survivors to report without fear of retaliation. 
Her opponent has taken a different, more muddied stance. Putting aside the numerous claims of sexual assault against Trump and the video evidence released by the Washington Post of him bragging to Access Hollywood host Billy Bush about sexually exploiting women, Trump and the GOP platform have taken some stances on addressing campus sexual assault that are causes for concern. For example, the GOP platform reads that all sexual assault cases be tried “by civil authorities and prosecuted in a courtroom, not a faculty lounge,” and criticizes the Obama Administration’s interpretation of Title IX to call for campus investigations and disclosure of all sexual assault reports to the federal government. 
This is a deeply problematic stance. Although it can hardly be disputed that higher education has been guilty of mismanaging sexual assault investigations, the criminal justice system has as well. The solution is not to simply cease campus investigations of sexual assault. The answer is comprehensive reform, an analysis of our policies and how we can make them better, and there is no better candidate to implement this type of reform than Hillary Clinton. 
Hillary Clinton has been a trailblazer her whole life.  When she saw injustice, she did not lose her temper, she did not ignore it. Rather, she listened and then took action. In college, Clinton shifted to the Democratic party because she was moved by the political awakening caused by the Vietnam War and civil rights activism. She was part of the political revolution of her time, and she chose to stand up and take action, dedicating her life to public service. 
In 1992, while facing ad hominem attacks for her decision to maintain her career as a practicing attorney during her husband’s presidential run, she rallied against the restrictive gender norms that minimized First Ladies to merely heads of the house, saying “I suppose I could’ve stayed home and baked cookies and had teas but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life” — a radical statement regarding women’s role in society for the early ’90s. And in 1995, she stood up and declared that “women’s rights are human rights.” This is the type of leader we need in this era of change we seek in the world. 
During her commencement speech at Wellesley College,  Clinton’s words still ring true for this critical time in American history: “One of the most tragic things that happened yesterday, a beautiful day, was that I was talking to a woman who said that she wouldn’t want to be me for anything in the world. She wouldn’t want to live today and look ahead to what it is she sees because she’s afraid. Fear is always with us but we just don’t have time for it. Not now.” 
Hillary Clinton does not just want to “live today” and “look ahead” without fear, she has had this same goal since she was a college student like us. She was one of us, she will fight for us, and we can be led into the future without fear in her capable hands. 
Without hesitation or reservation, the Daily Trojan endorses Hillary Clinton for President of the United States. She’s with us, and now we’re with Her. 
I am so happy that Hillary Clinton lost. Her policy proposals were terrible and she is dishonest and deceitful. Who else would have set up a private server to handle her official email? Who else would have erased any trace of 33,000 emails and then said that they all concerned yoga and wedding planning? Only Hillary. Only Hillary. Her dishonesty was her undoing. She and Bill may have been hoping to quintuple their fortune, but now those dreams are shattered.
As college students, you are not walking a tightrope between childhood and adult – you are an adult. Time to grow up. There is no such thing as a free lunch or anything free for that matter. The only question is who pays and who does not. It is clear people are getting tired of people in this country adopting a self entitled mentality without contributing their fair share. Yes – I am talking to all you welfare recipients who have not budged to look for work and instead adopted a lifestyle that only seeks handouts. Grow up – not all decisions are heroic “good” or “bad” decisions – this is not a bad Aaron Sorkin TV show – tough decisions are just that – decisions hard to make because not always a 100% cheery and fluffy results for everyone. Stop believing in unicorns and pixie dust.
I’m voting for Trump with the hope that if he wins it will permanently wipe away Hillary’s smirk once and for all.
In light of ALL the corruption, all the collusion, all the pay-to-play… you endorse Hillary? I wonder what the mindset here is. Is it simply the knee-jerk requirement to vote Democrat? You could have had Bernie…well, if there wasn’t all the DNC Shenanigans against him… you can still have Jill Stein. And, although I disagree with them politically, they seem genuine people. That’s something you cannot say about Hillary.
Sorry, baby. Just look at all the “investigations” against her for thirty years and it’s a big NOTHING. Jill Stein is “genuine”? She’s been vetted for 30 years? You “know” her? The GOP mounted this hate campaign against Hillary decades ago and even the left ilnternalized it: “Yeah, she’s a crook.” When you hear drek every day about somebody even the most intelligent and discerning will believe it. 
Oh, and BTW, Bernie is out campaigning with her proudly. He’s the wise one.
Wikileaks, “honey”. And, I’ll save you the typing. It’s been fully corroborated as the genuine, unaltered emails from Hillary, Podesta, Huma, etc. It wasn’t from the “BIG SCARY RUSSIANS”, it came from within the United States intelligence community. Oh, and BTW, the latest batch released from Podesta talks about the leverage the Hillary campaign has on Bernie to make him play ball. I guess you won’t talk about that. How about the proof that Debbie Wasserman Schultz coordinated with the Hillary campaign to tank Bernie’s campaign? No? Won’t face that either? Sad.
FULL OF SHIT u are, as Yoda might say. 
Her fucking email scandal is the biggest fucking nothing in the world, and a colossal waste of time. In spite of what you and your blood brother Giuliani think. (Did I say THINK?)
Except perhaps for you: you’re a gigantic nothing yourself, and I can enjoy myself imagining both your and your Orange Monster-Boy’s heads in one of his gaudy gold toiilets. AHHHHHHHH.
I don’t mind who people vote for, as long as they are politically engaged, reasonably aware of the issues and candidates, and able to articulate their positions.  However, this serves as yet another moment for me to state my belief that journalistic media should NOT endorse candidates for public office – period.  I understand that it’s a longstanding tradition, but I think it flies in the face of fundamental principles of journalistic reporting.  Of course journalists, like everyone, are entitled to an opinion and a position, but for the “editorial board” of a newspaper, magazine, or any news outlet to go on record with an official endorsement of a candidate immediately provides solid evidence of the bias that they are so often accused of.  In light of such endorsements, it is indeed all but impossible to accept that reporting by such news organizations isn’t tainted by it’s now-disclosed position.  There are plenty of reasonable and legitimate forums for partisanship.  Journalistic media and news organizations are not among them.
It is my opinion that political endorsements should be reserved for blogs, opinion columns, pundits, or publications whose stated purpose is to promote a particular cause, candidate or policy.  Traditional news outlets, including the Daily Trojan, should stick to clear, accurate and balanced delivery of news and information, and stay away from sanctimonious and tendentious endorsements.
Ms. Rodham is a felon, many times over and this disqualifies her for high office.  Because vagina is no reason to vote for a person.  Your editorial board’s endorsement makes me think we should raise the voting age.
Let’s break down this comment shall we?
1) I’m not sure you understand what a felon is, as Hillary was never convicted of a felony.
2) Implying that people are voting for Hillary solely because she’s a woman is frankly insulting and the type of misogyny  that many people deal with on a daily basis
3) You disagree with the choice of candidate for endorsement, and therefore believe that these people shouldn’t be able to vote. It’s no wonder this is your first reaction, when Republicans have gutted the VRA and Trump is encouraging “poll watchers” to intimidate voters in minority-heavy neighborhoods.
Let’s see what you’re saying Sandman – “She has admitted she used a private email server for government business which is in fact a felony, and you’re still saying this is OK.”  It’s not btw.  Stop picking nits.  The facts support the assertion that she is a felon, convicted or not.  Further, you falsely claim misogyny when plenty of her supporters use just this argument.  As to VRA being gutted, I guess you aren’t remembering how JFK and the Daley’s stole the 1960 election are you?  Same as happens in Philadelphia today when 100% of the votes in some precincts were for O.  Yep voter fraud does happen and the VRA is still in force.  Personally I suggest requiring ID – you likely don’t because your side benefits.
Don’t reply to this guy. He’s all over the place hating on Hillary. Screw him. 
He’s the type who would lynch somebody on flimsy evidence if he hated them. No trial. Just, “she’s guilty.”
I think he’s guilty. Of stupidity.
You are an idiot per se. Your language is criminal. She has not been charged with any crime. Anyone who would
vote for Trump needs to go back, and get a real education. Too bad your vote is worthless in California if that is
where you reside.
So you have no arguments and can only resort to insults, that’s what you’re saying Stevie.  
For my part, HRC is prima facie guilty of violating Section 1236.22 of the 2009 National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements states that:
“Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record keeping system.”
In Mrs. Clinton’s case, her emails were kept on her personal account (and private server) and her staff took no steps to have them preserved as part of State Department record.  Her attempt to evade this by returning a self-selected subset of emails does not constitute compliance under the law. Evidence available in the press indicates that relevant records were left out of her delivery in violation of this law.  This constitutes failure to preserve federal records and is punishable by law.  
There is NO legitimate reason for HRC (or any other SoS or other government employee) to bypass established communication methods and instead work through a private system, keeping secrets the public (her employer) has a right to know. 
QED Hillary is guilty of violation of this and several other Federal laws.  Based on available evidence she is guilty of a number of felonies.

Q: How do I deal with overbearing parents? 
Ahhh, when you finally leave the nest… It can be hard… especially on your parents. 
First, if you have parents who support you… in any and/or all capacities, please remember to thank them. They’re probably just checking in on you (every hour or so) because they care. If you’re from out of state, they most likely want to ensure that you’re being safe, that you’re growing and learning, and that you’re not homesick. They’re really only calling every 5 minutes because they love you. 
It’s hard to be independent but it’s also equally as hard to let go of a child whom you’ve nurtured and watched grow over the last 18 years. But, you’re doing this together. You and your parents. You’re learning how to cook on your own and they’re learning that they can’t watch your every moves. 
If you’re really stressed out about how much they interfere in your life, tell them (kindly, please). Tell them that you’re so grateful for their love and their support… but that you need space. Compromise! Let them know that instead of calling every hour, they should call every other hour or every other day! If you know where your parents are coming from, you’ll feel more inclined to hear them out. 
They love you. 
Side note: To parents, please let your kids make mistakes. Mistakes seem so daunting but your children will learn from their mistakes. It’s a part of growing up. No one lives a perfect life. No one goes through life without making a few mistakes or facing a few obstacles along the way. You’ve probably made them and your children will make them. Your children love you and one day, they’ll miss having you call all the time.

Photo courtesy of Jessica LevinsonPro and con · Panelists debated the benefits and drawbacks of Proposition 53, which would require voter approval for the state to issue over $2 billion in public infrastructure bonds that would lead to an increase in taxes.
Spectators gathered at Los Angeles City Hall on Saturday for BallotCon, an event designed to inform voters about statewide ballot measures.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics was one of the supporters of the event, which included speakers who discussed the pros and cons of each of the 17 measures that will be on the ballot on Nov. 8.
The convention was sponsored by The California Endowment, California Community Foundation and SeePolitical, a nonprofit organization that creates animated videos to simplify proposed legislation and the electoral process for voters. 
Both sponsors and opponents spoke on each ballot proposition, providing voters with information on why one side should be supported over the other.
The panelists discussed topics including a proposed tobacco tax, criminal sentences, school bonds, state fees on hospitals, revenue bonds, firearms and ammunition, legislation and proceedings, drug pricing, condoms in adult films and tax extensions. The attendance nearly doubled for a discussion on marijuana legalization later in the convention.
Toward the latter half of the event, speakers discussed Proposition 60, which would require adult film performers to use condoms during sex.
“This proposition is about public health and [bringing] fairness to the industry that has blatantly disregarded the law,” a supporter argued. “And if you look at any industry, when it comes to workplace safety, whether construction or medical, these people follow laws.”
Adult entertainer Siouxsie Q. opposed the proposition, saying that while there should be regulation, Proposition 60 would allow any California resident to file a lawsuit against a performer, producer or film crew member who participated in the production of a pornographic film that violated Proposition 60. 
This, she argued, would not keep the “already marginalized workforce” safe.
The death penalty was also a significant topic at BallotCon. One of the ballots discussed, Proposition 62, would remove the death penalty, while another, Proposition 66, would keep it but with certain modifications to make the appeals process faster and more efficient. Opponents of Proposition 62, who support keeping the death penalty in place, sent a written statement to the convention that explained why criminals such as child murderers, serial rapists and torturers deserve to be sentenced to death.
“Proposition 62 sets the worst of the worst burglars to get to stay alive at the taxpayers’ expense … even after committing their horrible crimes, in light of the pain of their victims’ families,” the statement said. 
Proponents of abolishing the death penalty argued, in turn, that capital punishment is racially skewed, unreliable and expensive.
“My perspective is fairly simple to understand: that we know there are innocent people on death row for crimes they didn’t commit,” said Alex Simpson, the associate director of the California Innocence Project and a supporter of Proposition 62.
Other topics discussed were Proposition 67, which would repeal a statewide ban on plastic bags, and Proposition 65, which would make proceeds from a 10-cent paper bag fee go to environmental causes.
A representative from the American Progressive Bag Alliance said that his organization supported voting “no” on Proposition 67 and “yes” on Proposition 65 due to plastic bags’ danger to the environment and profit to big corporations.
Dan Jacobson, part of the Environment California organization, agreed.
“[If all the bags used by California in a year are] stretched out end-to-end, it could circle the globe 200 times,” Jacobson said. 
Speakers also debated Proposition 59, which would allow the state to limit campaign contributions and political spending of corporations and big businesses. This proposition would allow state officials to use their authority to overturn the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. This decision allowed corporations to donate to political candidates on the grounds that they are “people” who have a right to freedom of speech. At Saturday’s event, a proponent of reversing this decision argued that money should not become a voice for corporations.
“[Proposition 59 would] restore our right to regulate money in elections and make it clear that corporations do not have the constitutional rights [that] human beings [do],” the supporter said. 
The opposition, however, argued that California legislature already opposes the Citizens United ruling, so voting “yes” on the proposition would be “a waste of voters’ time.”
“The main reason we do not like this proposition is that it’s asking voters to tell legislators to do something that the legislators will figure out eventually,” the opponent said. “Basically, it’s saying, ‘We want you to curtail the first amendment and we’ll leave it up to you as to how you do it,’ [and] that is terrible policy-making.”
