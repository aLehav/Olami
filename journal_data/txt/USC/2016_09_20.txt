Earlier this month, amid a wave of controversy regarding harassment on social media,  Instagram launched a new option enabling its users to moderate the comments they receive on their posts. The feature allows users to specify words they find threatening, and comments with these words will be filtered and deleted. Instagram’s founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, claimed the purpose of the feature was to protect self-expression.
“All different types of people — from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more — call Instagram home,” Systrom wrote. “But sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind. To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment.”
Systrom’s words speak to an emerging, overarching issue faced by women, people of color and individuals of different sexual orientations and identities, who face threats and harassment on social media. Harassment ranges from disturbing, triggering language to violent threats that discourage individual expression and tend to move victims to censor themselves for their own safety. This issue of social media bullying stems from the growing alt-right movement, which is rooted in extreme social intolerance and the silencing of marginalized groups. Ironically, individuals in alignment with the alt-right movement have seized and weaponized freedom of speech to justify their behavior, but it is their behavior that infringes on other individuals’ abilities to express themselves.
Those who argue against moderation of social media users’ communications and commentary and oppose punishment of those who use offensive speech often targeting diverse groups, ultimately argue that offensive speech is still free speech. But Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are all privately owned companies, with the right to enforce their own policies regarding language and expression. This offensive “free speech” has a record of silencing its victims by making them feel unsafe in expressing their ideas.
In July, Guardian columnist and vocal feminist writer Jessica Valenti temporarily quit Twitter after a rape threat was directed at her 5-year-old daughter. Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones did the same after alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos led thousands in spamming her Twitter account with racist sexist, and outright threatening comments. Twitter proceeded to ban Yiannopoulus’ account, but has yet to introduce concrete policies to prevent Jones’ experiences from being replicated. Meanwhile, investigations into online abuse (namely threats of killing and rape) fielded by female journalists reveal how such unsafe conditions have led many to censor themselves in fear of  intimidation and disturbing hate speech, merely for doing their jobs.
Earlier this year, one study by London-based research center Demos, found over the course of three weeks that more than 6,500 British Twitter users were on the receiving end of 10,000 explicit, misogynistic tweets containing the slurs “slut” and “whore” and found 200,000 similar tweets were sent to 80,000 people around the world over the course of those same three weeks. This inspired female British politicians to launch the “Reclaim the Internet” campaign to look into sensible solutions for protecting users from harassment, pointing to existing laws protecting people from harassment in the physical public, and arguing that this should be mirrored online.
“Forty years ago women took to the streets to challenge attitudes and demand action against harassment on the streets. Today the internet is our streets and public spaces,” Yvette Cooper of the Labour Party told the Guardian. “Yet for some people online harassment, bullying, misogyny, racism or homophobia can end up poisoning the internet and stopping them from speaking out.”
The goal of protective policies against abuse is not to silence the other side, but protect vulnerable groups from dangerous hate speech. Threats of violence and targeted harassment are entirely distinguishable from mere disagreement and argument.
It must be recognized that internet “trolling” is far from a joke and has disproportionate effects on marginalized people’s abilities to express themselves. Taking measurable steps to protect their freedom of expression is an important step in the right direction.
Unfortunately I only read the first bit of this article because I was unable to get past the total nonsense and falsehood mentioned in the second paragraph, where Systrom is quoted as saying “…we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment.”  
Really? Because that is not how life in the real world works.  
More sage yet simple wisdom coming your way, so have a seat and focus:  Of course we should be free to express ourselves in a fair and open society, but no you are absolutely NOT free or protected from criticism, or even harassment to some extent.  That’s the real world folks.  That’s adulthood.  That’s mature living in a fair and open society.  Go ahead and express yourself through word, deed, dress, music… however you like.  But be prepared for others to disagree with you… to reply, respond, critique, or even sue!  That’s how life works for everyone, but particularly if you take the extra step of expressing yourself on a social media platform.
Also, don’t forget that freedom doesn’t exist in a vacuum.  Freedom comes with an equal measure of responsibility.  There’s always so much focus on freedoms and rights, but never enough on attendant responsibility.
More proof that the anti-white establishment can’t defend its positions in open debate. The alt-right, despite a total lack of institutional power (not to mention funding) has won the argument about race and gender, so that the establishment has nothing left to resort to but censorship.

As urban Affairs Counselor Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote to President Richard Nixon in 1968, “Tory men and Whig measures are what changed the world.” The quote, of course, refers to the two competing political temperaments that have defined Anglo-American politics since the Tudors, Shakespeare and the Anglo colonization of North America: Whiggery and Toryism.
For those who do not study such things as neurotically as I do, Whigs are basically political liberals, and Tories are basically cultural conservatives. Whigs have stood for the advancement of individual liberty and social progress. Tories have stood for the preservation of custom and tradition.
Social progress versus custom and tradition? Evolutionary growth versus amelioration of social ills? It would seem that there could be no wider gap between opposites and indeed, nowadays, the American conservative-liberal divide often pits politically liberal social liberals against politically conservative social conservatives, broadly defined. “Liberals” tend to favor campaign finance reform alongside redistribution and social liberation; “conservatives” prefer a laissez-faire attitude toward governance and the economy, while promoting traditionalist social values.
But these are not the only combinations. One of the most common things you’ll hear nowadays, especially among politically independent millennials, is the inescapable phrase “I’m socially liberal but fiscally conservative!” The quip denotes social toleration and a conservative attitude toward government and economics -—-“I’m for government getting out of our lives in all ways, social and economic, and I believe in free markets and small government even as I support marijuana legalization and LGBT rights and abortion rights.” Gary Johnson and Ron Paul love to hear this kind of stuff, and many libertarians will point to this widespread attitude as the latest harbinger of the impending, inevitable libertarian empire of light and reason.
Carry the logic further, though, and these socially liberal fiscal conservatives enter precarious straits. You don’t need to be “socially liberal” to support equality before the law and equal treatment of people of all races, genders and religions; But it is generally the socially conservative temperament that values character, social capital and traditional institutions over pure self-actualization.
Meanwhile, is “fiscal conservatism” necessarily a good thing, in a day and age when the results of international deregulated free markets and drastic cuts in social spending have spawned socially-regressive ethno-nationalist movements across the world? You can support institutional reform and fiscal responsibility without succumbing to illusions about the universal benefits of free trade, and while acknowledging that strong productivity and high employment are more important than low taxes and balanced budgets. You can support work incentives and changes to the welfare and entitlements system without pursuing a narrow up-from-your-bootstraps social Darwinism.
Most socially liberal fiscal/political conservatives would pause here and qualify their ideology — they’re not in favor of letting people starve, and of course community is important. Everyone’s something of a moderate when the real-life implications of their intellectual schema are revealed, myself included. But ideas have consequences, in policy, society and otherwise; and in the past half-century, with fiscal and economic conservatives and social liberals generally winning most of the policy battles nationwide, alternative voices must speak out to balance the equation.
There are few people out there, it seems, writing from an “American Catholic” socioeconomic and cultural perspective — that is, on the necessity of economic justice and fairness, which involves a hefty role for political action in economic and social affairs, out of the desire for social solidarity and cohesion and unity, as opposed to more commonly championed values like individualism and cultural diversity. No one is writing for the American nation as a cultural and economic organism that exists in real time.
That’s the point of this column: to provide a socially conservative and politically liberal perspective on national, state and campus developments. In my opinion, as I will constantly argue, the best solutions for such problems will generally come from tragic optimists and conservatively-tempered politicos with liberal aims — indeed, Tory men (and women) with Whig measures. Stay tuned.

Eighteen blocks will be reserved downtown right near Freemont Street for Life is Beautiful. The art experience this year includes murals and enticing exhibits that shouldn’t  be missed. Local and known artists will be showcasing their unique displays throughout the festival. ETAM Cru, Crystal Wagner and Martin Whatson are a few of the art headliners. 
While great food is now an expectation at festivals, Life is Beautiful is not here to disappoint.

Q: What are your pieces of advice for keeping in touch with people from home?
I resonate with this question a lot because I was born and raised in New York and naturally (thanks to geography), most of my friends stayed in the Northeast. I grew up with a lot of these friends and keeping in touch has definitely been difficult, but I think it also helped strengthen a lot of my friendships. Cheesy as it sounds, friendship knows no bounds! Anyways (ignore my sense of humor), here’s a couple of things to help you keep in touch with those you love back home: 
Regardless of how you to choose to communicate, remember that friendship is a two-way street. You and your friends should both be making the conscious effort to catch up! Also, don’t feel like how close you are with someone is dependent on how often you talk to them. The people who are meant to stay in your life, will. Trust me. 
Submit your ethical quandaries to https://goo.gl/forms/Bni6CUsfXaHd7oRt1 and be on the lookout for sage advice from Ask Hahney.

Somewhere in a small town in Tennessee, a young 14-year-old girl sits by her record player and listens to Hotel California by the Eagles. The year is 1977 and the carpets are shag. The fifth studio album of the Eagles is monumental in the young girl’s life, following her for years. Lingering as one of her all-time favorite albums, she still never gets Hotel California’s relaxed guitar riff out of her head. 
When I asked my mom to pick out an album for me to review this week, I hadn’t anticipated Hotel California, but it clicked when I realized the overt album theme: California. Mom always told me she knew she’d come to California one day, leaving her rural upbringing to venture into practically another planet. It’s interesting to picture a once young teen listening to “Life In The Fast Lane” only for her to one day live the fast times in this metaphorical fast lane Don Henley smoothly sings. 
Before having listened to this album, I had never established an identity to go along with it. After listening to it again, I imagine this album to be the soundtrack of my mom’s life. Glenn Frey’s soft sounds of “New Kid In Town” incorporate rock elements but remain rooted to a country feel. I found this to be intriguing, paralleling it back to my mom and her upbringing in the Deep South. This song sounds to be a key track within the album, as the country theme played by Don Felder seem to reminisce old “bluegrass and country & western claims” once performed by former guitarist Bernie Leadon who departed the Eagles and at the time was replaced with “funk-rock” guitarist Joe Walsh.
Though the song touches on fleeting love, the title itself is spot on for my mom, and just about anyone who’s ever felt timid in entering a new surrounding. The song is simplistic yet complicated, vulnerable yet personable. Overall, Hotel California was a transitional album for the Eagles, setting them apart from their prior works and distinguishing them as versatile musicians with intuitive lyrics and instrumentation. I try to place myself in my mom’s position as a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee and a 23-year-old woman new to Los Angeles. Though almost a decade apart in age, Hotel California perfectly reflects both periods in my mom’s life. A soundtrack about the longing of adventure and a soundtrack about a newly achieved dream.
