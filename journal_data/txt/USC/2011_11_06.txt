Harry Peter Pachon, professor of public policy and expert on Latino politics and policy, died Friday of complications from aspiration pneumonia and Parkinson’s disease after several months in the hospital. He was 66.
USC School of Policy, Planning and Development Dean Jack H. Knott sent an email to faculty and students in the school Saturday.

“Harry was a kind and generous person and a wonderful and beloved friend and colleague to many at USC and in the broader Latino Community,” Knott said in the email. “He will be dearly missed as a friend and colleague, and his legacy of extraordinary contributions to Latino politics and policy at a crucial period in the development of the Latino Community in America will be remembered always.”
Pachon last taught at USC in fall 2010.
Knott said Pachon was “an effective and well-liked teacher who inspired his students.”
He also worked for the USC Center for Urban Affairs as a National Endowment for the Humanities postdoctoral fellow between 1973 and 1974.
Pachon was the principal investigator for several million dollars of externally funded research grants and contracts, including an evaluation of children’s coverage programs for The California Endowment and one for a program promoting minority and low-income employment in construction projects for the Department of Transportation.
Pachon had served as the President of the Tomás Rivera Policy Institute since 1993, and arrived at USC in 2003, when the center moved from Claremont Graduate University, where Pachon was the Luther Lee Professor of Public Policy.
“Under his leadership, TRPI grew into a civic research organization with national visibility and impact, making major contributions in the areas of immigration, education policy, and Latino politics and policy,” Knott said. “As director of TRPI, Harry had a tremendous impact on the Latino community, both locally and nationally.”
In 1983, he co-founded and served as chairman of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Education Fund.
Pachon was appointed to the President’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans in 1997. He also received the Ohtli Award from the Mexican government that year for service on behalf of the Mexican immigrant community in the United States.
Pachon often presented expert testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives, House Senate and judiciary committees and several caucuses comprised of racial minorities. He also served as a consultant for the Carnegie, Ford, Kellogg, California Health Care and Feddie Mac foundations.
Pachon published four books, several book chapters and journal articles about Latino social capital, educational opportunities, political engagement, electoral behavior and racial justice.
He also served on the boards of several local organizations, including the John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation, Southern California Public Radio and the Education Advisory Committee of the Rand Corporation. In 2000, the NALEO Education Fund designated its naturalization assistance and civic participation activities as the “Harry P. Pachon Civic Education Program.”
After receiving his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in political science from California State University Los Angeles, he earned his PhD in government from Claremont Graduate School.
Pachon is survived by his wife, Barbara, and their children. The School of Policy, Planning and Development said in the email it would inform community about the details of his memorial service.
Dr. Pachon was my professor when I attended Claremont Graduate University in 1993. I vividly remember our class being so full of students and  there were no extra chairs for even Dr. Pachon to sit, so he decided to take the trash can and turn it upside down so that he could sit down. He was such a great professor, so down to earth and very caring about his students. He will truly be missed…My deepest sympathy to his wife and family.

The perception of college freshmen gaining weight by eating fast food and having irregular workout schedules is being reexamined according to researched set to be published in the December issue of Social Science Quarterly.
Perceptions · Experts say the freshman 15 serves as a psychological reminder for college students to eat healthily and to work out regularly to avoid gaining weight. - Daily Trojan file photo
The average college freshman gains between 2.4 and 3.5 pounds, with a average of 3.1 pounds for women and 3.4 pounds for men, according to the research.
The study found women gain an average of 8.9 pounds and men gain an average of 13.4 pounds over the course of four years in college. Of college freshmen, nearly 10 percent gains 15 pounds or more, but 25 percent actually loses weight.
Richard G. MacKenzie, associate professor of pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine who served as head of the adolescent medicine division at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles from 1973 to 2008, said the way students perceive themselves in their adolescent years can have a long-term affect on their health.
“It has been shown that body image and personal body structure established during the adolescent and young adult years greatly influence future body make-up and physique,” Mackenzie said. “Students should be sure to stay in shape now.”
Evan Pye, a freshman majoring in global health, said he thinks he has gained some weight this year, but it is not necessarily a problem.
“I don’t think it’s a bad thing,” Pye said. “Students eat and drink and should enjoy it.”
The research found the two biggest factors in weight gain were drinking and working. Students who drink heavily gain nearly one more pound each year and those who are employed gain an extra one-fifth of a pound for every month they work.
“The weight gain is commonly a product of not having the usual boundaries and schedule set by the home and after high school activities,” MacKenzie said. “Once away from home, these routines have to be re-established in surroundings laced with new temptations — teen-tasty high caloric foods, partying, alcohol ingestion with associated calories and dietary inhibitions.”
Ganesh Sundar, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the freshman 15 should not be used as an excuse for generic weight gain.
“If people do gain weight during the year, then I am pretty sure they will blame it on account of the freshman 15,” Sundar said. “People are always looking for excuses or someone else to blame if they do something wrong.”
MacKenzie said the freshman 15 is helpful in promoting health awareness.
“If we are aware of the risk of any behavior, we are in a better position to prevent it,” MacKenzie said. “Weight gain during the freshman year is usually not purposeful but a consequence of situational changes, decreased self awareness and personal health vigilance, along with an altered life-style.”
Some students said they changed their habits to avoid weight gain when they entered college.
“I’m trying to avoid gaining the freshman 15 by making healthier dining choices, like going to some of the healthier dining options on campus, like Lemonade and Seeds, rather than only eating at dining halls,” said Kelsey Lee, an undeclared freshman.
Joanna Chiang, a freshman majoring in communication, said she changed her diet to avoid putting on weight during her freshman year.
“Many of the dining halls that mainly freshman eat at provide very limited healthy dining options,” Chiang said. “I’ve tried to avoid gaining [weight] by becoming a vegetarian, which I feel will reduce the amount of unhealthy fats that I consume each day.”
Camille Dieterle, assistant professor of clinical occupational therapy, said the myth of the freshman 15 might serve more as a psychological reminder for students to be healthy.
“Talking about it serves as a cautionary tale against an unbalanced lifestyle with unhealthy eating and not enough exercise and sleep,” Dieterle said.
She said students should follow common-sense advice to stay healthy.
“Freshmen, and any college student, can avoid weight gain by not skipping meals, including breakfast, avoiding excess sugar and alcohol, avoiding overconsumption, including moderate and vigorous exercise most days and getting about eight hours of sleep most nights,” Dieterle said.
Javan Shah, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he thinks students use the freshman 15 to justify weight gain caused by unhealthy decisions.
“I haven’t gained any weight,” Shah said. “[The freshman 15] is just a phrase and should not have a lot of influence on what people think.”

The amount of money the university received from patent licenses, as well as the number of patents issued to USC, increased substantially from the 2009 to the 2010 fiscal year.
Licensing revenue nearly tripled from 2009 to 2010 from around $4.5 million to $12.3 million, while the number of United States patents issued to the university increased from 43 to 58.
The USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, which is in charge of managing the university’s intellectual property, attributes the increase in patents and patent revenue to a growing focus on specialization.
The Stevens Institute for Innovation has encouraged faculty members to focus their knowledge on particular fields of study, according to Ian Murphy, director of communications for the institute.
“Within the past year, we’ve dedicated industry teams, like a life sciences team, in which people who work under that licensing area have a deep background and have commercialized companies and products in that particular field,” Murphy said. “These people are uniquely qualified to work in that certain field because they have the interest and expertise to work on a project for long amounts of time.”
Direct methanol fuel cells, which were invented by a USC Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute team and have the capability to generate clean and efficient energy from methanol, are an example of a patent the university added within the last year. The technology has since been licensed out to other institutions, such as SFC Energy Inc., a German manufacturer of methanol fuel cells for automobiles.
“Direct methanol fuel technology had been in the works [at USC] for several years and the technology has incredible applications for something like recreational vehicles, because it’s very clean and off the grid,” Murphy said. “The fuel cells would allow you to park your vehicle, and then use these battery-style direct methanol fuel cells to power your kitchen and lights and other thing without hurting the environment.”
The Stevens Institute for Innovation also offers services and advice for students wishing to patent their ideas or innovations, Murphy said.
“Students wishing to patent their ideas can go to the legal office hours of a patent attorney on campus, which would allow them to consult with an attorney and decide the best way to pursue a particular idea,” Murphy said.
The Stevens Institute for Innovation also holds the annual USC Student Innovator Showcase and Competition, where student innovators pitch ideas for new innovations in several different disciplines, such as cinematic arts, information technology and life sciences. The event is designed to encourage student innovation and entrepreneurship.
Judges for the showcase award cash prizes to the most innovative and most business-savvy ideas.
Sonic Edge, an device that implements ultrasound smart-sensors with disposable surgical tools such as needles, was named most innovative at the 2011 Student Innovator Showcase, held Oct. 28.

A dark, chilly night foreshadowed the USC women’s soccer team’s fate Friday.
In front of a crowd of 3,826 at Drake Field, the Women of Troy (7-13, 4-7) dropped their Pac-12 finale 5-2 at the hands of No. 2 UCLA.
Swan song · In her final game donning the cardinal and gold, senior Brittany Kerridge notched her ninth assist of the season against UCLA. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The Bruins (15-1-3, 8-1-2) started fast, putting USC on its heels with a multitude of shots on freshman goalkeeper Carley Pennington. UCLA took advantage of mistakes and found space to run, controlling possession, and the Bruins finally broke through in the 21st minute with a goal from forward Sydney Leroux. UCLA followed this up with two more goals — by midfielder Samantha Mewis and defender Ally Courtnall — in the next 12 minutes to put the difference at 3-0 after just 33 minutes.
“We kept giving the ball away in dangerous parts of the field,” USC coach Ali Khosroshashin said. “You can’t do that against an amazing team like this.”
Despite trailing, USC refused to give in. A goal from junior forward Samantha Johnson in the opening minute of the second half cut the deficit to 3-1. But the momentum was short-lived as Leroux and Mewis each scored their second goals of the contest to put the game out of reach. In the latter minutes of the game, senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge lofted a ball off a corner kick to the far post where junior defender Kristina Noriega drilled a shot into the net to make the final score 5-2. It was Kerridge’s ninth assist on the season and the 15th of her career, which puts her at No. 8 on USC’s all-time list.
“It would have been easy for these girls to give up in the second half with the score being what it was,” Khosroshahin said. “But these girls battled and showed a lot of pride in representing their university. It’s been a tough season and we’ve been very thin with injuries, but I’m very proud of these girls.”
The match marked the last game for five USC seniors: Kerridge, midfielders Ashli Sandoval and Carly Buther, defender Claire Schloemer and forward/defender Ashley Freyer.
Coming off a second-round loss in the NCAA tournament last year at the hands of eventual champion Notre Dame, the Women of Troy started the season at No. 25 in the nation. Losses in 11 of their first 14 games and injuries, however, were too much to overcome.
After the match, Khosroshahin emphasized learning from this season to improve for next year, noting the first priority for the offseason was recovering from the trying season, getting healthy and incorporating the incoming talent to come back next year as strong as possible.
Johnson echoed similar sentiments, as she will be one of nine returning seniors on the roster.
“We need to build up from the bottom and be as strong as possible,” she said. “We’ll be back stronger next season.”
This program definitely has reached the bottom. Time for a change in the head coach. He has gone downhill from winning the national title with the predecessor’s players in his first year to this less than mediocre season. No excuses to being on the opposite end of your crosstown rival by a large margin.
Well, the head coach position was recently endowed (though not yet fully funded).  And the endowment is named after the current coach’s father.  Firing the coach now would be kind of awkward.

The No. 4 USC women’s volleyball team made the most of playing at home last weekend with back-to-back three-game sweeps of Pac-12 contenders No. 10 Washington and Washington State.
After a tough road trip last week that saw the Women of Troy (20-4, 15-2) face off against No. 3 Stanford and No. 7 California, they took full advantage of playing at the Galen Center against lesser competition.
“[It was a] great weekend for us. Saturday night we had a stunning crowd of over 500 fathers and daughters here,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “Plus we had great match versus Washington with a 3-0 sweep.”
Playing the Huskies (18-6, 10-6) for the second time this season, Haley’s group came away with another three-set (25-15, 25-16, 25-21) victory.
Senior middle hitter Lauren Williams, who had a quiet weekend last week, returned to her All-American form against Washington and Washington State, posting 20 kills along with just two errors — good for a .529 hitting percentage against the Huskies and a perfect 1.000 against the Cougars.
On top of her excellent hitting performance, Williams was able to establish herself on defense, racking up three blocks in each game over the weekend. Haley has wanted to see Williams, long hailed for her dominant offensive output, make more of an impact at the net, and her continued progress in that department is a boon for an already-strong USC defense.
“Williams was absolutely good with six stuff block and a couple of diving saves on the floor,” Haley said. “We were pretty pleased with everything that went on.”
For Washington, Bianca Rowland lead the way with a team-high eight kills, but the Huskies struggled to establish much offense throughout the match. USC held vaunted Washington freshman Krista Vansant to a -.32 hitting percentage as the team’s kills leader couldn’t find her rhythm throughout the match.
The crowd of 2,612 — the second-largest crowd in Galen Center history — witnessed USC’s first season sweep of Washington since the Women of Troy’s 2003 national championship run. With the win, USC also now has topped 20 wins for the 14th time in the last 16 seasons.
On Friday, USC made quick work of Washington State (12-13, 4-11), holding the Cougars to .106 hitting percentage, en route to a three-set sweep.
Williams was perfect on the day with 10 kills and no hitting errors, while fellow senior Alex Jupiter continued her excellent all-around play recorded a team-high eleven kills and four digs on the day.
Sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund keyed a defense that held Pac-12 points leader Meagan Ganzer to just seven kills, while forcing her into 11 hitting mistakes. Hagglund has been an unsung hero for the Women of Troy and her 22 digs only reaffirm her status as one of the Pac-12’s top liberos, as she averages 5.27 digs per contest.
“It’s important to get better on defense, which will help us achieve our goal to go to the Final Four and eventually the national title,” Haley said. “Hagglund has been by far the best libero in the country as she produces every night and gives us such strong on-court leadership.”

Senior women’s diver Victoria Ishimatsu started her season on the right foot last weekend, sweeping 1-meter springboard and the platform dive events as USC hosted the Trojan Diving Invitational.
Ishimatsu also won the preliminary rounds in the 3-meter with a score of 296.20 and scored 333.35 in the finals to win by more than 50 points over UCLA’s Emma Ivory-Ganja.
For the men’s team, freshman Jordan Gear finished in fifth place in the 3-meter dive as Arizona’s Benjamin Grado won all three events on the day by at least 13 points. Gear finished with a score of 301.70.
USC diving coach Hongping Li expressed satisfaction with the overall performance of Ishimatsu and his team in their first major competition of the young season.
“Ishimatsu stands out in winning all three events,” Li said. “Jordan Gear, the freshman, had a solid performance [too].”
The Trojans will next take part in their first Pac-12 meet when the swim and dive team travels to Arizona to face Arizona and Arizona State on Nov. 11 and 12.
“We need to have an injury free and healthier team for next week and the rest of the season,” Li said.

The No. 2 USC men’s water polo team goes into each game with one defensive goal — hold the opposition to four goals or less. Rarely does it fail to reach that goal, but its Mountain Pacific Sports Federation matchup against No. 9 Pepperdine proved a stiff challenge for the Trojans (17-2, 6-0) in that regard.
On the attack · Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic registered eight goals over the weekend, helping lead the Trojans to two victories at home. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
USC defeated the Waves 14-8 on Saturday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, thanks to a strong offensive showing. The defensive effort, however, was uncharacteristically shaky. It was the most goals allowed by the Trojans in regulation since a 10-8 win over UCLA earlier in the season in the finals of the NorCal tournament.
“It’s disappointing because it’s our goal to keep them below four,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said. “[Saturday] we didn’t achieve that. Pepperdine, to give them credit, they have some great shooters and they deserve full credit for the offense they put up against us.”
The first period of the game saw the Trojans score four points, while Pepperdine failed to get on the scoreboard. The Trojans continued to show off their offensive prowess with another goal to quickly start off the second period and ultimately lead 6-0 midway through the second period.
A goal from Pepperdine with five minutes left in the half gave the Waves some momentum. A strong performance by sophomore driver Tobias Preuss, who notched a hat trick in the first half, still made the Trojan offense potent.
USC still managed to score two more goals in the first half, leaving the score 8-1.
In the second half, the Trojans then let in seven goals.
“We did a great job in the first half,” Dennerley said. “In the second half we slipped up a few times defensively but we’ll look at the tape and see what we can improve upon.”
It proved a sharp contrast to last week, when the Trojans allowed just four goals in an 8-4 win over No. 4 Stanford.
“To come out and give up eight goals was not idea, but again, we are still building upon the season,” Dennerley said.
But offense certainly wasn’t an issue.
Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic earned a hat trick against the Waves.
“It’s just good confidence-wise knowing that I can still do what I wanna do and that it is working out for me,” Vavic said. “Hopefully I can keep it up but it’s definitely a big confidence boost.”
The Trojans topped Chapman with a score of 17-6, with goals from seven different Trojans, including five goals from Vavic and three from redshirt junior driver Andrew Reego.
“All around we did really good offensively,” Vavic said. “We were fired up from the beginning and as long as we play like this we should be able to keep up the success.”
Freshman driver Kostas Genidounia was once again out of the lineup for the Trojans after injuring his hand against California on Oct. 15.
“Obviously it is not a good thing when you lose one of your better players but we have done a good job adapting and hopefully he is back soon,” Vavic said.
The Trojans face off in their final home game of the season, a nonconference game against Concordia, on Saturday at 5 p.m.

The talk following Friday’s game might have been junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s play and record-breaking performance with six touchdown passes.
Youth movement · Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee finished with 130 yards and two touchdowns. It was his first two-touchdown game. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
But USC’s special teams’ play has arguably been one of the Trojans’ biggest strengths this season. Entering the game, junior left tackle Matt Kalil was responsible for two blocked field-goal attempts and two point-after attempts. On Friday night, the Trojans blocked two field-goal attempts, giving them a total of four blocked field-goal attempts and two point-after attempts through nine games this season.
“We always try to go for the ball,” Kalil said. “It was definitely a momentum-changer for them not getting any points on those two drives and it helped us score [after those blocks].”
Kentucky holds the record for blocked field-goal attempts in a single season (2004) with six. Senior fullback Rhett Ellison got a hand on placekicker Will Oliver’s 31-yard attempt in the second quarter and redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer blocked a 37-yard attempt early in the third quarter.
“We studied their [special teams],” Telfer said. “We figured there was a weak link. We lined up and knew where to go. I was surprised he was kicking line drives. It kind of caught me by surprise, but I took advantage of it.”
—
The play of Barkley and his top targets — sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods and freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee — might have overshadowed the play of the Trojans’ running game. USC gained 243 yards on the ground on 33 carries, an average of more than seven yards per carry.
Because senior tailback Marc Tyler did not play, USC coach Lane Kiffin employed a three-back rotation. Junior tailback Curtis McNeal notched 10 carries for 87 yards but left the game early because of a thigh contusion. Redshirt freshman tailback D.J. Morgan had nine carries for 56 yards and freshman tailback Amir Carlisle finished with 10 carries for 90 yards, two receptions for 31 yards and a touchdown.
Carlisle, who entered the game with just two rushes for 14 yards, was the recipient of Barkley’s sixth touchdown pass. Carlisle’s 19-yard score in the fourth quarter was also the first of his USC career.
“Coach called my number and I made the most of it,” Carlisle said. “The offensive line did a great job. It was a total team effort and it felt great to get in there and contribute.”
—
Carlisle’s play was not the only significant contribution from USC freshmen. The Trojans started a total of five true freshmen — Lee, offensive guard Marcus Martin, linebackers Lamar Dawson and Tre Madden and kicker Andre Heidari — and seven total freshmen including Telfer and linebacker Hayes Pullard, who redshirted last season.
“Almost everybody making plays is young,” Kiffin said. “Look at the touchdowns on offense — Amir Carlisle, a true freshman, Marqise Lee, a true freshman, Xavier Grimble — and then on the defensive side of the ball, three linebackers making plays that are freshmen. The future is very bright.”
Madden and Dawson made their first career starts at USC. Because freshman linebacker Dion Bailey was out with an injury, Madden replaced him in the starting lineup. As for Dawson, the coaching staff elected to start him rather than senior Chris Galippo.
“After last game, we saw [Dawson] had been playing well,” Kiffin said. “We wanted to see what he looked like.”
—
Quick hits
– With the win, USC is now 6-0 all-time against Colorado.
– Colorado’s touchdown in the first quarter was the first touchdown scored by the Buffaloes against USC in the three matchups between the two teams in Boulder.
– Matt Barkley became the first quarterback in USC history to throw five touchdown passes or more on four separate occasions.

Let’s admit the obvious: Junior quarterback Matt Barkley is in an awkward position.
“One more year, one more year,” several hundred USC fans echoed in the moments following the Trojans’ 25-point rout of Colorado on Friday night.
Barkley exited the field with a wide grin, with “Conquest” blaring, and a fan base pleading with him to stick around.
If the third-year starter eventually declares for next April’s NFL draft, where he could be a top-10 overall pick, his college career won’t last much longer than three more weeks.
It won’t end with a New Year’s Day celebration in Pasadena. There won’t be fireworks. There won’t be new hardware added to the Heritage Hall lobby. It’ll end at the Coliseum on Thanksgiving weekend and that’ll be that.
He’ll be a millionaire. He’ll be scouring for real estate in Denver, or Indianapolis, or Seattle. He might even get to play in the postseason — imagine that.
But with USC in the midst of what could in terms of wins, be its best season since 2008, Barkley insists the NFL hasn’t crossed his mind.
“I don’t even think about it,” he said at the post-game press conference Friday.
It’s hard to gauge where this USC program stands at the moment. With Barkley back next August, USC could very well be ranked in the top-10, as a national title contender or a Rose Bowl favorite.
Without Barkley, the dropoff could be steep — no matter how fast, how skilled sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods or freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee are. A .500 season could be on the horizon, just as USC starts to feel the burden of scholarship restrictions.
Fellow juniors, left tackle Matt Kalil, defensive end Nick Perry and safety T.J. McDonald might also opt to follow suit and head to the professional ranks — all could be first-round selections as well.
It could potentially be in Barkley’s best interest to move on. It’s been a terribly long three years, and he’s certainly done enough for the university at this point. Maybe it’d be for the best; leaving would be understandable. It’d be hard to begrudge him.
Questions remain nonetheless, even months before any decision is made: Is this the end? For a quarterback who arrived with the promise of hoisting a crystal ball in January, is his lasting legacy going to be: quarterback of the sanctioned era?
It never should have been, but that’s the situation that appears to be presenting itself with three games remaining this season.
Barkley put on his best poker face following the game, deflecting any and all talk about the coming months.
“It could be one more year,” he said, refraining from giving any sort of indication as to his future plans.
He tried to avoid any further discussion. He conducted the band. He hugged his parents, his family, his friends, reveling in a record-setting performance of six touchdown passes. He wanted to soak Friday night in — nothing more, nothing less. He certainly didn’t want to talk about the NFL. Who could fault him?
But the a subject is becoming increasingly difficult to gloss over. Fans and media want to know whether there will be a final act. Are we ever going to find out how good Barkley and USC coach Lane Kiffin can be together?
They’re better than most have been willing to admit: at last a near-consensus top-25 caliber team. But with Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck set to graduate and an Oregon program whose fate still hangs in the balance thanks to the NCAA, the Trojans could also find their ceiling lies higher than most think.
There have been limitations these last couple of years, no doubt. A postseason ban, for one, won’t give USC a chance to face a 10-win team from the Big 12 or the Big Ten in December. For now, the last measuring stick will be a trip to Autzen Stadium on Nov. 19 against Oregon.
But every touchdown pass thrown this season begs the question of whether they can do this when a trip to the Pac-12 title game or a BCS championship is on the line.
It’s almost unfair to ask Barkley to come back and return USC to national prominence. He didn’t sign up for this. Nobody ever told him he had to “rescue” USC. He arrived during better times.
He’ll graduate in May, and he’ll likely be a top-10 draft pick.
There is still one quarter of the season left, granted, but it’s hard not to wonder whether this is in fact the last chapter.

The last time USC visited Folsom Field in 2002, it came away with a 37-point victory over Colorado.
This time wasn’t much different.
Record setting · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley, who had thrown five touchdowns in a game three times before, tossed six touchdown passes against Colorado, marking a single-game school record. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Behind a single-game school-record six touchdown passes from junior quarterback Matt Barkley, the then-No. 21 Trojans (7-2, 4-2) toppled the Buffaloes 42-17 in front of a near-sellout crowd of 50,083 Friday night in a rare primetime matchup.
“We talked all week how this is a trap game after the emotional loss last week,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said six days removed from a triple-overtime loss at home to No. 4 Stanford. “It was nice to see our guys play well despite all the injuries we have.”
Barkley’s record-setting pass came in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter, as he found freshman tailback Amir Carlisle on a 19-yard screen pass, ballooning the Trojans’ lead to 24 and serving as the final scoring play of the game.
“It was awesome,” Barkley said. “The screen finally worked.”
The third-year signal caller had on three separate occasions  finished with five touchdowns in a single game against Hawaii and California in 2010 and against Syracuse earlier this season.
“I didn’t know it was going to come tonight,” Barkley said of his record-breaking display against the Buffaloes, who ranked second-to-last nationally in passing touchdowns entering the game.
With six touchdown passes through the air, Barkley increased his season total to 28.
“[He] did a great job,” Kiffin said. “We have a bunch of young guys around and he did a good job of leading them.”
Though USC would finish with its third-highest scoring output of the season, it trailed early in the game.
Colorado (1-9, 0-6) opened the game on a six-play, 69-yard drive that ended when quarterback Tyler Hansen found wide receiver Tony Clemons for a 38-yard touchdown pass over the middle.
It marked the Buffaloes’ first lead since an Oct. 1 game against Washington State.
But USC responded quickly, scoring 28 unanswered points in the first half — all touchdowns by way of Barkley, who would finish with 318 yards through the air on 25-of-39 passing.
On USC’s first drive of the game, Barkley found freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee for a 33-yard touchdown pass. On the Trojans’ third drive, he found freshman tight end Xavier Grimble from eight yards out.
Lee would later conclude the first-half scoring outburst, catching a 25-yard pass from Barkley.
“The trust is there,” said Lee, who finished with nine receptions for 124 yards and two touchdowns — his second 100-yard receiving game of his career. “And now it’s going to get better and better.”
In the moments following the catch, Lee rushed over to the sidelines, handing the ball to Kiffin after the first-year wideout also notched his first two-touchdown game of the season.
“I was tired of being called ‘No. 9,’” Lee said. “You have to catch two touchdown passes for [Kiffin] to call you by your first name. So after, I took the ball to him.”
Despite his 144 receiving yards and a touchdown against Arizona on Oct. 1, among other impressive performances, Kiffin had simply referred to Lee as No. 9 for much of the season.
“We have told him when he gets a multiple touchdown game people will know his name,” Kiffin said. “After he scored the second touchdown he came over to me and gave me the ball and said, ‘My name is Marqise Lee.’ He is coming of age out there.”
It would also appear Lee isn’t the only freshman to be coming of age.
The Trojans started three freshmen on defense — all at linebacker in Lamar Dawson, Tre Madden and Hayes Pullard — and seven total.
The young unit, nonetheless, proved tough against the Buffaloes, limiting them to just one touchdown after the first series.
Hansen would find Clemons again in the fourth quarter, but USC’s lead was already well above 20 points by that time.
“We have a great class from top to bottom,” Carlisle said of the four true freshmen who started in Dawson, Lee, Madden and offensive guard Marcus Martin. “We have a lot of talent out there and it’s going to be a bright future for USC. We have just been working hard.”
Rounding out the defense was an inexperienced secondary, as senior Marshall Jones and redshirt junior Drew McAllister filled in for injured juniors Jawanza Starling and T.J. McDonald, who was serving a suspension for the first half play following a late hit on Stanford wide receiver Chris Owusu a week ago.
“It was the outcome we wanted,” Kiffin said. “It was nice to play well in all phases of the game.”
USC hosts Washington next Saturday in its annual Homecoming game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at 12:45 p.m.
The Huskies have beaten the Trojans twice in the last two seasons, 32-31 at the Coliseum last season and 16-13 at Husky Stadium in 2009.

Prodigies. We hear more and more about them every year. The 11-year-old with a million-dollar iPhone app, the 13-year-old with a golden arm and a scholarship for USC or even the 15-year-old Cambridge graduate — they all make headlines.
Puppeteering prodigy · Constance Mark’s documentary Being Elmo details the story of Kevin Clash’s (right) career with asides from acclaimed figures, such as Whoopi Goldberg, Kermit Love, Frank Oz and Jim Henson. - Photo courtesy of David Magdael and Associates Inc.
But a puppeteering prodigy? That’s far more rare. There’s no better way, however, to describe the life of Kevin Clash, the subject of Constance Mark’s documentary Being Elmo: A Puppeteer’s Journey.
And although Clash’s most recognized accomplishment — being the puppeteer and voice behind the ubiquitous Elmo of Sesame Street and Tickle Me Elmo fame — is the impetus for the film, it is Clash’s journey from prodigy to the most famous street in public television history that truly invigorates the story.
Clash, whose voice and appearance belie the furry red monster so many of us grew up with, started his life in Baltimore as nothing more than a child with an unusually clear sense of what he wanted to do. A few Saturday mornings spent in front of Captain Kangaroo and the early Sesame Street, and Clash knew puppeteering was for him. What follows is classic American dream narrative, as Clash is hired by his local public television station, works hard and gets thrust into the surprisingly vibrant New York City puppeteering scene of the 1980s.
Whoopi Goldberg sparsely narrates Clash and others recalling encounters with legends of the game Kermit Love, Frank Oz (you might know him as Yoda or Miss Piggy) and of course the late Muppets founder Jim Henson, whose mastery of the subject drives Clash’s wonderment and ambition.
Those looking for a day-in-the-life-of documentary will likely be disappointed, as will those looking for in-depth analysis of the impact of Sesame Street, Elmo, or even the fact that Clash was the first black puppeteer to be hired by the long-running children’s show.
The documentary doesn’t even begin to breach these topics, which might be damning; but let’s be honest, the heart-melting Elmo character doesn’t really need that kind of introspection.
What the audience does get is a real look into the complex and intertwined world and experience of puppeteers where Henson stands as the guiding light of the entire world. It’s not surprising, then, that the most touching scene in the film is not of Clash spending time with children — of which there are many — but instead a scene from Henson’s 1990 memorial service where 40-plus Muppets and their puppeteers sing “Just One Person,” a song celebrating the power of just one person believing in you, something with which Clash can certainly relate.
Experiencing puppetry through Clash’s eyes is inspiring. Amid training the cast of the new French Sesame Street and spending time with an aspiring young puppeteer the audience gets a sense of Clash’s mastery of the subject and his passion for it, a clear success of Mark’s story-telling ability through documentation.
There is plenty of footage of Clash, and it’s clear his story has been the subject of interviews and films in the past, Mark using older-looking footage to paint a growing picture of Clash. The consistency of the storytelling falters, however, in scenes where there just isn’t the footage to back up the stories. What accompanies some stories from Goldberg, Oz, Clash and his engaging parents can be described only as schmaltzy cut scenes that belong in a video game or a far too literal music video.
Clash tells the story of his nervousness before meeting Henson for the first time, and how he spent a few minutes in the bathroom collecting his thoughts. The audience is given a sepia-toned bathroom sink that keeps running for far too long on screen. It feels out of place in a film centered on the idea of inspiration through visual storytelling and puppets.
But besides these visual miscues the film thrives on its ability to tell its story through the magic of puppetry and the success Clash has found. The film might not engender the sense of nostalgia you were looking for, but Clash’s story proves just as endearing, educational and grin-educing as an episode of Sesame Street.

There’s probably no Mexican dish more gorgeous and historically rich than mole (pronounced “mo-lay”). The dish looks like muddy gravy but packs a scrumptious array of flavors.
It’s a complex paste of miscellaneous earthy ingredients that takes a day to make. Rich in flavor and folklore, mole is a complicated dish because of the sheer amount of ingredients mixed in; the average mole requires about 30 different ingredients.
These ingredients are first ground and mixed before meticulously stirred and cooked over low heat for hours. Finally, the product is painstakingly strained into a velvety smooth sauce.
Mole, taking its name from “molli,” a Nahuatl word that means “mixture” or “concoction,” is more than just a sauce. It is the most beloved national culinary figure of “mestizaje” — the cross-cultural blend of Old World and New World influences that combines indigenous and foreign ingredients with ancient techniques.
Mole is serious business. To get the flavor profile right, the cook must have an acute understanding of the characteristics of different chiles, which form the base of all moles. No ingredient is extraneous; each is chosen for its unique qualities.
The dish is so celebrated in Mexican culture that the annual Feria del Moles (Mole Festival) is thrown at a village in San Pedro Atocpan in Mexico City. This communal feast draws food aficionados from all over the world; hungry attendees crowd around stands that dole out samples of moles and watch jubilant musical and dance performances.
The festivities have spread to Los Angeles, where the fourth annual mole cook-off was held in October. The event took place on Downtown’s Olvera Street and featured a battle between Oaxacan and Pueblan moles. La Sandia at Santa Monica Place is extending the festivities indoors with its special mole-tasting menu.
Though a contemporary Mexican restaurant, La Sandia’s mole stays true to tradition. The temporary menu is a collaboration between Richard Sandoval and Mexican culinary ambassador Ana Luis Almazan, designed to showcase all the best classics: mole negro, mole poblano, mole almendrado (mellow-spiced with almonds and cinnamon), mole rojo (reddish sauce made piquant with dried red chiles) and mole pipian (vibrant-green, medium-spiced thin sauce).
The mole menu at La Sandia ends Nov. 19, but cheap dining options for decent mole are available year round in Los Angeles, the city with the highest population of Mexicans outside of Mexico.
The Mexican states of Oaxaca and Puebla are most famous for their moles. If you hop over to Eighth Street in Koreatown, you’ll find Sabores Oaxaqueños, a Oaxacan restaurant distinguished by a garish pink sign.
Oaxaca is known as “Land of the Seven Moles,” and you’ll find most of them at Sabores Oaxaqueños, served in different forms. To learn the true taste of mole, order the bittersweet, charcoal-dark mole negro served over a whole chicken leg or pork.
You can also get mole negro mixed with shredded chicken and stuffed into a plump, tender tamale steamed in a fragrant banana leaf. Or try tlayuda, the black paste on a Oaxacan-style pizza spread on a thin, crispy tortilla and topped with creamy, stringy Oaxacan cheese.
Though some versions of mole are famous for their inclusion of chocolate, not all moles are chocolate-y. Some renditions of the dish, such as mole negro, add just a small slab of bitter Mexican chocolate into the stirring pot during the final stages of cooking.
The other popular mole with chocolate is mole poblano from Puebla, an amber-brown swirl of nutty, spicy and bitter flavors typically served over turkey. It’s the chocolate that makes mole a cross-cultural dish, as cooking chocolate into a common dish would have been scandalous to native Mexicans before the Spaniards arrived.
But mole can range from thick and dark to light and bright-colored. Each kitchen has its own preference for ingredient ratios, which makes mole all the more mysterious and fascinating.
Moles la Tia is a quaint East Los Angeles-based restaurant specializing in traditional and creative moles. Other than the classics, Moles la Tia also conjures up unique concoctions, such as tangy hibiscus, beets and red wine mole, sexy passion fruit mole and even coffee mole for a jolt of savory caffeine.
Bring a friend along and split the cuatro y cuatro, an overflowing platter of proteins and moles. Though slightly pricy, it’s the best bang for your buck considering you get a giant pyramid of savory rice, stacks of salmon, shrimp, pork, steak or chicken, and four bowls of whatever mole is on the menu.
Just as marinara sauce is to Italy, or béchamel to France, mole is Mexico’s national culinary pride. For centuries, mole has brought families and friends together at dining tables with its savory magic, which tastes as multi-dimensional as its layers of culture and tradition.

An excellent article on mole, very thorough and well done.

Washington D.C-based rapper Wale has already made big changes to his short music career.
Though his 2009 debut album Attention Deficit received critical acclaim, it garnered poor album sales. According to a radio interview Wale did on WPGC 95.5 in D.C. earlier this year, poor album sales, as well as a lack in confidence from record executives, led to Wale’s move from the major label Interscope Records to the newly formed Maybach Music Group, headed by rapper Rick Ross.
Evidently, Wale stood out; many reviews, including one in XXL Magazine, said Wale outshined his label-mates on the album Self Made Vol. 1, which included label boss Rick Ross himself.
And with even more anticipation behind his newest album Ambition, Wale had a lot to prove.
The first three tracks — “Don’t Hold Your Applause,” “Double M Genius” and “Miami Nights” — have a triumphantly celebratory sound, incorporating dynamic horn sections and lyrics about success. They set the tone for the album, showing off Wale’s confidence.
Ambition isn’t solely about “luxury rap,” however — the album also has its share of songs about women, bringing in some celebrated R&B singers to lend their talents to the album.
The lead single, “That Way,” with collaborators Rick Ross and Jeremih — also featured on Self Made Vol. 1 — features Wale and Rick Ross discussing women over a laid-back beat accentuated by the light use of piano throughout the song. Rick Ross fits well with his “boss” style verse, and Wale’s relaxed flow pushes the song along smoothly. Jeremih’s strong vocals add control to the calm hook, effectively bringing the song together.
Similarly, “Lotus Flower Bomb” entices listeners with its smooth vocals as up-and-comer Miguel works with Wale’s sensual beat. The two complement one another quite well in this song about turning a one-time meeting into a long-term relationship.
Though “Lotus Flower Bomb” is compelling, “Sabotage,” featuring Lloyd, goes beyond intrigue and sets itself apart as one of the album’s clear standouts.
Accordingly, Wale and Lloyd create an honest aura in their verses as they rap about a girl who cannot stay committed to a relationship. Wale’s voice gets progressively coarser throughout the song, giving his verses a raw sense of emotion. The track’s beat has a catchy old-school feel to it, and the live instrumentation of the drums, guitars and horns draws the listener in.
Not surprisingly, Ambition features several songs about Wale’s ambitions to reach the top of the hip-hop game. “Focused” has Kid Cudi singing on the hook over a hard-hitting beat, with Wale dropping lines like I be kickin’ my raps good, with or without sales / I’m killin’ these blackheads, my rap is Noxzema.
Though the other numbers impress, it is the title track, “Ambition,” that might have the best beat on the entire album: It’s epic, dark sound gives the track a fittingly serious feel. It features fellow Maybach Music Group rappers Meek Mill and Rick Ross, and though these two deliver very respectable verses, Wale once again shines over them on this track.
The same cannot be said about “Slight Work,” which features G.O.O.D. Music rapper Big Sean. The up-tempo club-style beat samples a whooping alarm, a woman saying “work it,” and other pops and clicks, making the song sound fun and catchy. What it lacks in its beat, it makes up for with its lyrics. Big Sean kills with his flow, possibly spitting the best lines on the entire album: Top floor like I’m out tanning / And they stole your whole delivery, now that’s outlandish / I guess like the delivery man, I’m outstanding / Car-tinted, I’m in that tint like I’m out camping.
It is difficult to pick out a few standout tracks on this album, but this is not a bad thing. Ambition is an album in the true sense of the word; it is not filled with radio-ready singles, nor is it a couple of pop-y songs surrounded by a bunch of average filler tracks. It is a collection of exceptional songs that gives listeners insight into the way Wale interprets life and his own experiences.
On Ambition, Wale takes a big step toward defining his style — musically and thematically. The growth from his freshman to sophomore album shows a shift from storytelling rap covering broad topics to lyricism based on punch lines and deviating from the mainstream. Is it something that everyone will enjoy in this world driven by chart rankings and mega-hit singles? No. But those who want an album composed of truly innovative hip-hop will be more than satisfied.
With this album, Wale has demonstrated how far ambition can really get you.
Great article. Wale’s album is definatly incredible. I agree w/ everything you said except…. On the track ” Ambition” Meek Mill KILLED it. The picture that he paints of what “ambition” used to mean to him is unparralled to the other versus. Thanks for the article.

Study spaces inadequate
Imagine it’s a Friday night and you have a major project due the following week. Though most of your friends are planning to take the night off, you make the responsible choice to study for the evening. There’s only one problem: Every library on campus is either closed or overcrowded.
Though Leavey Library is open 24 hours a day, the combination of the dismal wall color, fluorescent lighting and monotonous color scheme hardly composes an inviting workspace. Not to mention how crowded Leavey becomes during exam season.
Aside from Leavey, there is no facility on campus for studying after 5 p.m. on a Friday evening. Therefore, students are left to plead with their roommates for quiet time, or perhaps seek out a seat in Starbucks at University Village.
The Undergraduate Student Government has acknowledged the lack of adequate study locations, and has attempted to improve the situation by extending hours at the campus center during finals.
Though these extended hours are greatly utilized by students, it seems slightly illogical to think that students at a highly renowned research university only need a place to study during exams. These extended hours only occur during finals, leaving students to fend for themselves during midterms.
The lack of alternative study locations affects the entire student body and causes significant harm. According to USC’s Mission Statement, the “first priority as faculty is the education of our students.”
How is academic excellence to be achieved if there is no policy in place to support and promote the student body’s ability to study? By failing to provide proper study environments, the university is potentially preventing students from reaching their academic potentials.
There seems to exist a poorly prioritized set of values and misuse of resources by USC’s administration. For example, Trojan Grounds, a cafe filled with snacks, is open 24 hours a day, yet most of the study facilities on campus close between 5 and 8 p.m. on the weekends.
Wouldn’t it seem more justifiable to put such resources towards promoting academic excellence?
While it is true that there are monetary costs associated with extended facility hours, one might argue that these are appropriate ways to spend extra funds. A program to extend study hours would produce sufficient benefits that would outweigh the costs, such as increased academic excellence and increased satisfaction of the student body.
In response to this demand, USC Libraries extended the hours of the Von KleinSmid Center by three hours. This effort combined with that of USG is a step in the right direction, but it does not completely solve the issue.
Therefore, the university should implement a plan to extend library hours on campus.
Calli Cholodenko
Junior, communication
I agree with Ms. Cholodenko.
As a recent graduate of USC, Rossier School of Education, and a fully employed professional, I was fortunate enough to have a quiet study place either in my office after hours off campus, or in the conference rooms of the Rossier School. The Doctoral Support Center (DSC) set up weekly and monthly sessions where students could come in, plug in, and focus on studying and writing. As we know, most of the buildings at USC are now locked with controlled access via ID card into the facilities after traditional business hours. I suggest the Dornsife College, and other academic units, devise a system where students may access the empty classrooms to utilize the unused space for continued studying. If the controlled access system keeps a record of who enters and exits the building via the ID cards, potential security concerns could be mitigated. 
The Rossier School and the DSC had one staffer assigned to be with those who studied in Waite Phillips Hall at night, and permitted that staffer to check into work later the next morning to balance out the hours worked that week. This was a great system providing structure and a dedicated time to study, which was monumental in my efforts to complete a doctorate while also fully-employed. Other academic units would be wise to follow this model.
I’m a comm major (like you) and have never spent more than a few minutes studying for an exam. Clearly you are doing something wrong.
Not everyone is quite as lazy as you, and yes — some of us actually came to college to LEARN and push ourselves, not just brag about how little effort we expend.
I’d love to have the libraries open longer; it’s quite disturbing that the miserable and overcrowded Leavey Library is the main place available in the evening.

Women outnumber men at most colleges and universities — something that would have been unimaginable at a not-so distant point in history.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
But when it comes to the STEM fields — science, technology, engineering and math — women are still critically underrepresented.
Though the recent increase of women in fields like biology and medicine indicates a significant change in such traditionally male-dominated academic spheres, it is not an across-the-board change.
The increase of female students signals a potential for future growth and integration, yet the lack of women in other STEM areas means universities should be doing more to keep the numbers growing.
As the Daily Trojan reported at the end of last month, more women are receiving master’s degrees nationally in STEM disciplines than ever before.
The number of women with biological and agricultural masters degrees increased 5.4 percent and health science 11.1 percent.
According to a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences report published in February, half of all M.D. degrees and 52 percent of life science Ph.Ds today are held by women. In 1970, only 13 percent of Ph.Ds in life science went to women.
But the changes are simply not happening in computer science, engineering, math and physics.
USC is aware of this, and recognizes the work the university has to do to spur change.
The math department has a variety of programs geared toward women. These include a summer program for all undergraduates thinking about applying to the graduate program as well as one for women who have been accepted to the program, and  a Women in Science and finally an Engineering Program developed to increase the number of women in tenured and tenure-track faculty STEM positions.
These kinds of programs should be offered in all STEM departments.
Outreach and support are key to create a more welcoming environment for women at all levels, from undergraduate to faculty.
Also, exposing high school students to STEM fields is critical so that younger generations realize their interests and options early on.
USC has recognized the importance of early outreach. The university offers a summer science program for high school and even middle school girls at the Phillip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island.
Special women’s programs and initiatives, research grants and enhancement of research opportunities are all proven, effective ways to support and achieve full gender equality.
Women’s clubs on campus, such as the Society of Women Engineers and USC Women in Math, also provides sub-communities for women that enhance and support academic programs.
Clubs such as these definitely help women to be even more determined to prove themselves in these disciplines, independent of extra efforts from the university.
Women working in STEM fields, even the female high school students who are just interested in math and science, are trailblazers who should be proud of their role in changing the face of education. Universities should continue to encourage women to be involved in STEM fields through outreach and programs that assist them.
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish. Her column “Beyond the Classroom” runs Mondays. 
Women with decent-sized breasts are critically underrepresented in STEM fields. Honestly, what is it about science that attracts all the homely ones?
Quagmire…take your juvenile contributions to Beavis and Butthead…get off the commentary.
Anti_BAdegree-cynic:  same is true for males students…the rigor of the STEM requirements are also a reason to not pursue those related degrees and vocations.
Beavis and Butthead are funny. 
The hot chicks do the slacker majors; see “song girls, sorrorities.” They got to concentrate on their looks, not academics, to get them through life. The homely ones aren’t genetically well-endowed, however you want to interpret that, and hence they focus on academics; but particularly rigorous routes. 
STEM disciplines are rigorous regardless if males or females pursue them.
So, when I was at Marshall as an undergrad, I came across 2 female students who switched majors to business. One declared pre-med, but she said she “lost passion for it,” and the other was a computer science major but switched to business. 
The computer science major put it plainly, “it was too hard.” The other girl “lost passion” for pre-med courses. 
Are STEM disciplines that hard? Or is business the “fall back” major if you can’t hack STEM disciplines?
[…] is the fact that this decline continues even though more entering freshmen are declaring one of the STEM majors when they begin college. What are universities doing to push bright math and engineering students […]

The set up: Fresh off a heartbreaking triple-overtime loss to No. 4 Stanford, USC had a short week to rebound for a Friday night matchup. Thankfully, that matchup was with the dreadful Colorado Buffalo, who have yet to win a Pac-12 game and are just 1-9 on the season. The Buffalo’s losses include 48-7 to Stanford, 52-24 to Washington, 45-2 to Oregon and 48-14 to Arizona State.
The story: Add another Buffalo beatdown to that list. USC’s 42-17 domination included a school-record six touchdown passes by Matt Barkley, who was serenaded to chants of “One more year!” as he left the field.
Playing without both starting safeties due to T.J. McDonald’s first-half suspension and Jawanza Starling’s injury, the Trojans gave up a quick score to Colorado on the Buffalo’s first drive, capped by a 37-yard touchdown pass that ate up the inexperienced USC secondary.
From there, it was all Trojans. Barkley and the Trojans answered right back with a 33-yard touchdown pass to Marqise Lee. Then the scores came rapidly for the Trojans. Barkley to Xavier Grimble for a five-yard touchdown to start off the second. Barkley to Robert Woods from 15 yards at 7:02 of the second. Barkley to Lee again from 25 yards to end the half up 28-10.
The second half was a similar story. A scrambling Barkley found Woods for a 45-yard touchdown on what the sophomore wideout described as a something you might see in a pickup game at the park on Sunday. Then it was the record-setter; Barkley to Amir Carlisle from 19 yards on the Trojans first drive of the fourth quarter.
All told, Barkley finish 25-of-39 for 318 yards, six touchdowns and one interception. On the ground, carries were split almost evenly between the starter Curtis McNeal and a pair of freshmen, Carlisle and D.J. Morgan. McNeal had 10 carries for 87 yards, Carlisle 10 for 90, and Morgan nine for 56, 31 of those coming on one play.
Lee and Woods each had nine catches and a pair of touchdowns, Woods totaling 130 yards to Lee’s 124. Woods also had what would have been his first kickoff return touchdown of the season called back by a Tony Burnett holding penalty.
Fresh faces: The Trojans started three freshman linebackers, two new safeties and were still missing Torin Harris at cornerback.
As usual, Isiah Wiley started in place of the injured Harris. At safety, junior Drew McAllister started for the suspended T.J. McDonald, and senior Marshall Jones stepped in for the injured Jawanza Starling. Linebacker Dion Bailey was out with a concussion, so true freshman Tre Madden started in his place. And senior middle linebacker Chris Galippo bowed out to another true freshman in Lamar Dawson.
This left only linebacker Hayes Pullard and cornerback Nickell Robey as the preferred starters in the Trojan back seven.
“My name is Marqise Lee”: No matter what Marqise Lee has done this whole season, Lane Kiffin has referred to him simply as “number nine.”
The coach contended to his true-freshman receiver that people wouldn’t know his name until he scored two touchdowns in one game. Obviously that turned out not to be true, but the coaching staff stuck with its gimmick.
After Lee scored his second touchdown against Colorado — shortly after he had the drop of the season in another would-be touchdown — he ran up to Kiffin, gave him the ball and said, “My name is Marqise Lee.”
Up next: A homecoming, revenge-filled showdown with Washington next Saturday at the Coliseum. The Huskies stunned No. 3 USC 16-13 in Seattle in 2009, and then knocked off the No. 18 Trojans last year in Los Angeles on a field goal as time expired. And only after Joe Houston missed a 40-yard field goal that would have given USC a 34-29 lead with 2:34 left. And only after the Huskies converted a fourth-and-10 and a third-and-five on their final drive, leaving the Coliseum in dejected silence.
