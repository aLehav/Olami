Four weeks into the semester, there are a few things we’ve figured out. We’ve gotten to know our new professors and, love them or hate them, they’re here to stay. And with the start of the semester, coming off the heels of the Women’s March, the one-year mark of President Donald Trump’s term and in the thrust of the #MeToo movement, comes the start of a new — but also very old — criticism: Can’t these liberal professors just keep their politics to themselves?
As politics seeps deeper into daily college life and inside the classroom, so has the chorus of voices calling out political bias by professors. Earlier this month, the San Diego State College Republicans released a list of over a dozen professors whom they identified as “the biggest contributors to left-wing bias and indoctrination” due to the inclusion of their politics in the classroom. 
Yet, even though most professors lean left, their politics don’t prejudice their teaching, but inform and create it. In fact, where appropriate — in political science, public policy, sociology, women’s studies, economics, social work and urban planning, among many other inherently politicized disciplines — their political beliefs are an inevitable and inescapable consequence of their work. 
The first important consideration is that while professors lean left, they don’t lean as uniformly left as widely believed, and the degree varies by discipline. Inside Higher Ed notes that the most complete study of political leanings in professors, conducted by Neil Gross while at Harvard University, reveals that more faculty members identified as moderate (46 percent) than as liberal (44 percent), while 9 percent of faculty members identified as conservative.

The mere fact that there are more liberal than conservative professors in universities is not enough to sound the alarm bells that our universities are hotbeds of liberal brainwashing. In many disciplines, the presence of liberalism is a consequence of the field itself. Take gender studies, for example: Those who care about women’s issues — so much that they dedicate their lives to studying it — are more likely to identify with the feminist ideological worldview of the left. Then there’s academia itself: Professors might want to share their knowledge in a process that they might see as shaping the next generation of leaders even if it means taking a pay cut in the process. There’s something about that that speaks to a left-leaning ideological worldview, as Gross and his colleague Ethan Fosse noted in a 2010 study. That’s not to say that conservatives can’t or don’t want to become teachers, but they might experience a generally greater propensity toward higher salaries in business, finance or similar sectors.
And while liberalism might be a consequence of that work, it also means that those professors might teach the class content in a broader context that favors one ideological worldview over another. That’s not a bad thing. It is an extension of a professor’s expertise and an important understanding of the broader social impact that that coursework might implicate. Crucially, students are free to disagree, and often do. 
Some people have proposed remedying the ideological imbalance in faculty by actively recruiting more conservative professors to higher education. Yet, the rhetoric used by these critics who seek “ideological diversity” invokes a false equivalency between the kind of diversity sorely needed in higher education — gender, racial and socioeconomic — and the artificial indicator of ideological worldview. Regardless, there is room for conservatism at universities. For example, economics and business faculty members tend to skew more conservative, largely because of the free-market philosophy that drives their disciplines. 
I’ve taken classes taught by outspoken liberal professors, outspoken conservative professors and professors who carefully present alternative perspectives on each issue. I’ve  greatly enjoyed all of them. So I’m looking forward to another great semester, and to putting the fallacy of the liberal college classroom to rest.

One Los Angeles night in the spring of 2017, three USC students gathered to talk about making music: Anna Scholfield, a junior majoring in public relations; Jamison Baken, a junior majoring in music production; and Benny Friedman, a junior majoring in geodesign. Shortly after, folk-pop band Bannack was born.
“Benny and Anna were spring admits at USC and met at an open mic while studying abroad in Paris in the fall of 2015,” Baken said. 
Baken then entered the equation once the two started at USC, meeting Friedman in a fraternity and deciding to try their hand making music together.
“When we got to USC that spring, Jamison and Benny met while pledging [Phi Delta Theta],” Scholfield said. “The three of us got together to jam one day and liked the way our voices sounded together.”
Once the trio decided to make the band official, their first challenge was figuring out what to call themselves. 
“Deciding on a band name proved to be one of the hardest parts of this process,” Friedman said. “We went back and forth and ultimately decided on ‘Bannack,’ which is a ghost town in Montana. We liked the idea of giving new life to a place that was probably otherwise unreferenced in popular culture.”
Soon after, Bannack began work on what would become their debut album Compendium, while also performing small shows in coffee shops and bars around USC and the rest of Los Angeles. The early stages of recording took place at the Thornton School of Music.
“We mostly recorded in Thornton studios, and we also recorded some instruments and vocals at [Audio Engineering Associates],” Scholfield said. “The folks there were kind enough to loan us some very high quality ribbon microphones that we would never be able to afford. A good amount of the vocals were recorded in Jamison’s closet.” 
All three members were heavily involved in the songwriting process, initially causing them to worry if their music would carry a singular sound. 
As their chemistry grew, however, Compendium began to form and fell under the realm of folk-pop.
“We each wrote different songs on the album, so at the beginning of the process we were nervous about it not sounding cohesive,” Baken said. “As we rewrote lyrics and added harmonies and instrumentation, though, it all started sounding like one project.”
Baken’s meticulous production allowed the songs to blend together seamlessly, but the trio also enlisted the help of some of their peers to create a fuller sound on Compendium.
“Clayton Sewelson on drums, and Harry Zec’s insane guitar skills added so much to the recordings,” Scholfield said. “We experimented with a lot of different bass ideas and through the process ended up with four different players on the album: Alexina Boudreaux, Nicholas Eisenhauer, Randon Davitt and Harry’s brother, Joe.”
 Though splitting up lead vocals and songwriting can be difficult for many acts, it was a very natural process for Bannack.
 “The making of Compendium was a pretty even split between the three of us,” Friedman said. “Benny wrote some of our catchiest songs, Anna wrote a lot of lyrics and harmonies, and Jamison did so much with instrumentation and came up with a lot of our favorite musical moments on the album.”
Some aspects of the recording process, however, proved to be more difficult, such as commuting to various L.A. studios when none of them had access to a car. Despite the difficulties, however, Bannack has nothing but wonderful memories of the creative process.
“Jamison had this iconic burp while we were recording the vocals for ‘Slip’ that we considered making its own track,” Scholfield said. “We also recorded in our underwear one day because Jamison’s apartment was so hot.”
Ultimately the group came away impressed with the project, and they’re happy they can finally share their music with the world. Unable to choose a favorite song, Friedman noted how different songs are best suited for different moods.
“We love each song for what it was made for,” Friedman said. “‘Fade Away’ and ‘The Wild’ are great for listening to after a breakup. ‘Yellowstone’ and ‘Pull Me On Down’ will put a zip in your step and ‘Scars pt. 2’ will make you feel super weird.”
 Compendium is out now on Apple Music and Spotify, with singles “Slip” and “Stop It All! (Before I Fall)” available on SoundCloud.

Kitty Guo | Daily Trojan
I had everything all planned. I had seven titles picked out, for a total of seven column pieces this semester. I knew exactly what order I was going to write them in, knew exactly which aspect of my life I was going to connect them to, knew exactly what part each book would play in painting myself as a Sophisticated Intellectual. 
According to K. Karivalis’ Adult Gummies, that makes me a Jen. 
I picked up the slim, 90-page novella last week, mostly because it was short enough to finish in a half hour and I’m trying to keep pace with my 2018 reading goal. And now I’m throwing my meticulously crafted agenda out the window, so that, already, should be a testament to its impact. 
Adult Gummies follows four 20-somethings who work together “in an office in a generic mid-sized US city with well-defined seasons (i.e. snow in winter).” Jen, Thad, Kat and Dirk are the Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte of a militantly PC, post-9/11 society. Do you wish to spend your life trimming weed in Colorado like Kat? Do you suffer from perpetual existential anxiety like Thad? Take this Adult Gummies quiz to find out which millennial stereotype you are! 
The story starts out innocently enough, documenting workplace dynamics, recreational drug use, the revealing nature of one’s choice of tissue box — standard stuff — then swiftly ratchets up the absurdity until Jen is literally smashing her way through a glass ceiling with a baseball bat, only to fall to her knees in despair upon encountering a sea of heels. It’s window dressing all the way down (or up, in this case).

I’m ambivalent toward calling myself a millennial, because whether I am or not depends on which thinkpiece you read. The general malaise that characterizes the generation, however, I relate to with every fiber of my being. And I, too, feel vaguely nauseous at the prospect of graduating college to be shuttled straight into the corporate conveyor belt. 
But I was most struck by Jen, who is consumed with her personal #brand, curating and constructing every facet of her life and interactions. She plays a perennial game of chess, and she is always five moves ahead of everyone else, calculating possible outcomes and subtly nudging the pieces in her favor. Which, come to think of it, sounds a lot like me. 
Even though I use social media sparingly, whatever content I do post has gone through several iterations, been agonized over, the presence or lack of a comma deliberate and intentional. How I present myself — the clothes I wear, the way I interact with others — is all performative, all part of the chipper and sanguine or the cool and sardonic persona I’m adopting, tailored to my conversational partner. I’ve mastered the art of self-objectification. And when I’m alone, I just plug myself into an outlet and power down. 
Adult Gummies is both darkly satirical and fondly affectionate, an eye roll and a love letter. Karivalis simultaneously lampoons the Baby Boomers’ laments over our laziness-vanityselfishness-immaturity and acknowledges the kernels of truth they contain, but celebrates them anyway. She explores office culture, the “Biz Caj” lifestyle, the gnawing trepidation over an imminent technological takeover. But most of all, she explores the shifting definition of “relationship” amid automated communication, the humanity inherent in the search for meaning, the yearning for beauty and authentic emotional connection that is singular to no generation. 
As Karivalis writes in a hauntingly poetic, uneasily prescient forward: “It’s not our fault we want to be artists. Art will be the last human vocation.”

Over the weekend, the USC women’s tennis team traveled to Columbia, S.C. to compete in the ITA Kick Off Weekend. In the tournament, the Women of Troy fell to Clemson 4-2 on Friday and swept Oklahoma 7-0 on Saturday. Following their recent matches, the Trojans now sit at 3-2 this season.

Against Clemson, USC came out fighting early, securing the doubles point with both teams winning their respective matches. Although the Trojans dominated in doubles, the team was inconsistent in its singles matches. Only sophomore Becca Weissmann won her match, and Clemson ultimately took home the win.
“From the beginning, coming out on the court, even prior to the match, the energy was just great and I could feel it,” Weissmann said. “That definitely translated into doubles. [Gabby Smith] and I had a great doubles match, and coming into singles I felt really great about my energy, and from there I honed in and zoned in and I felt really great throughout.”
Hungry for a win, the Women of Troy looked unstoppable against Oklahoma. The Trojans posses an all-time record of 3-0 against the Sooners. The team got off to a hot start picking up the doubles point easily and then followed by sweeping the singles. Weissmann secured the first win, which was quickly followed by senior Madison Westby winning her match 6-3.
“I don’t think anything really changed,” Westby said. “We came out to Clemson with a lot of energy; that was our main goal — to have a lot of energy and start out strong. We did that in the Clemson match, we just unfortunately didn’t come out on top. But we still liked how we competed and so we just made an effort to do the same thing the next day.”
According to coach Alison Swain, the Women of Troy were able to rebound against Oklahoma after analyzing their first match.
“We talked about those momentum shifts after the match, and we talked about being really focused and on it when we’re trying to close things out,” Swain said. “[Westby’s] match was a great example of that — her match went three sets against Clemson. Against Oklahoma she finished her match and got the win in two sets and really closed it out well. Those kinds of things make a big difference and that was a big improvement for our team into day two.”
The team has two and a half weeks until their next game. Swain plans to make the most of the training time available. 
“We’ve played five matches. Everybody has a sense of where they’re at, how they want to improve, and so this training block gives us some time to work on those things,” Westby said. “That started today, and Chris and I put together a three-week plan for the girls. Number one, we’ll make sure everybody’s healthy, number two we’ll push our fitness, and number three work on some tactical things to implement before our matches in late February.”
Westby already knows how she wants to improve in the next few weeks.
“Going forward with our next three-week training block, I’d really focus on having a higher first serve percentage, so that’s my goal before the next match,” she said.
The team will play its next match at San Diego State — whose team currently sits at 3-0 on the season — on Feb. 16.
Instead of scouting San Diego State, Swain prefers to keep the focus on her own team.
“It’s good to know some information about the teams you’re playing, but it’s more important to know where we are, and how we want to get better,” Swain said. “It’s really about focusing on us and how we can take our tennis to the next level, and a lot of that is how we’re competing. We’re going to work on that in the next three weeks, and if we’re doing that well, we’re going to have a great match with San Diego.”

Two former USC women’s soccer players were selected on Tuesday in the 2018 NWSL Dispersal Draft. Forward Morgan Andrews was selected as the second pick in the second round by the Seattle Reign, while goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme went to the Houston Dash as the sixth pick in the third round.
Former USC goalkeeper and NCAA National Champion Sammy Jo Prudhomme was drafted by the Houston Dash in the 2018 NWSL Dispersal Draft. Daily Trojan file photo.
The draft took place after the Boston Breakers, one of the league’s founding teams, announced that it would cease operations on Sunday. All of the players who were under contract or whose rights were owned by the Breakers were eligible for selection in the draft, along with any members of the team’s Discovery List. 
Andrews and Prudhomme graduated in 2017 and played integral roles in the Trojans’ championship run in the 2016 NCAA College Cup. The duo were both part of head coach Keidane McAlpine’s early success with building his roster through transfers — Prudhomme left Oregon State after a stellar season with the Beavers in 2013, while Andrews left Notre Dame for the Trojans at the start of the 2015 season.
In her two years with the program, Andrews scored 47 goals for the team, including the team’s first ever hat trick in the College Cup in 2016. She went on to become a captain that season, scoring one of the three goals in the 2016 national title game against West Virginia.
Andrews was selected by the Breakers with the third overall pick of the 2017 NWSL Draft. A native of Milford, N.H., the selection was a homecoming for Andrews, who grew up dreaming of one day playing for the Boston program. She made 18 appearances for the Breakers. She also made several appearances for the U.S. U-17 and U-20 national teams, notching 2 goals.
Now, Andrews heads to the Seattle Reign, a program that has defined itself as one of the most stable in the league in both success and in fan support. The team finished first in the regular season in both 2014 and 2015, and finished fifth overall last season. On her new team, Andrews will join a roster stocked with international superstars such as midfielder Megan Rapinoe. Prudhomme only allowed 27 goals during her two years as a keeper for the Trojans, becoming the core of the “brick wall backline” that defined the defense-first national championship team in 2016. She made 106 saves and only allowed 11 goals in that season’s run to the national title, earning distinction as Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year.
In her solo season with the Breakers, Prudhomme made five appearances in the net. She now heads to the Houston Dash, a team that has struggled historically. In past seasons, the Dash has finished at the bottom of the league almost every year, failing to ever qualify for the playoffs.
However, off-season trades and re-signings mean that Prudhomme will have the chance to play behind names such as striker Christen Press and forward Rachel Daly. In goal, she will be jockeying for playing time with Stanford alumni Jane Campbell, an up-and-coming star for the U.S. national team.
The dispersal draft consisted of five rounds of nine picks, with teams choosing in an order selected by a weighted draw based on last season’s results. Most teams chose to defer their selection to the fourth round, leaving several younger players off the roster of any team for the foreseeable future.

It was a shocker.
On Monday, the Los Angeles Clippers traded ninth-year forward Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for elite defender Avery Bradley, forward Tobias Harris and a first-round draft pick, among other assets. 
The move indicates the Clippers are serious about cleaning house and starting fresh. It also concluded the most interesting, controversial and successful era in franchise history. 
When the Clippers drafted Griffin with the number one overall pick in 2009, the team remained a laughingstock, a true cellar-dweller of the NBA. Before Griffin, the Clippers had made it to the post-season on just three occasions since moving to Los Angeles in 1984. Even after their recent string of successes, the team still holds the second-worst all-time winning percentage among active NBA teams (.394). 
Griffin didn’t immediately reverse the Clippers’ fortune. In the build-up to his highly anticipated rookie season, he injured his kneecap in a pre-season game and did not suit up for the rest of the year. He appeared to be yet another highly touted Clippers’ draft pick turned bust, right alongside Antonio McDyess (No. 2 overall in ’95), Michael Olowokandi (No. 1 overall in ’98) and Darius Miles (No. 2 overall in ’00). And believe me, that list could have been much longer. 
But the narrative doesn’t end there, as Griffin came back with a fury in year two. In 2010, he started all 82 games, scored 22.5 points per game, won Rookie of the Year honors and lit the team’s fan base on fire with ferocious dunk after dunk (he won the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest, leaping over a Kia in one round). 
The Clippers won 32 games in Griffin’s first full year — its highest total since the 2006 season. Suddenly, a downtrodden organization found its foundation atop his massive shoulders. 
New Orleans Hornets point guard Chris Paul joined L.A. via trade in 2011, transforming the team into playoff contenders. With the development of center DeAndre Jordan and the acquisition of sharpshooter J.J. Redick in 2013, the team became elite. “Lob City” was officially open for business.
Los Angeles has made the Playoffs in each of the past six years, nearly doubling the franchise’s all-time appearances since Griffin got drafted. The Clippers’ winning percentage since 2010 (.604) is nearly 25 percent higher than its all-time number. 
Griffin averaged 21.6 points during his career as a Clipper. He exits with the second-most points in Clippers’ franchise history, fourth-most rebounds, and fifth-most assists. At age 28, he’s already the greatest Clipper of all time, with Paul as a close second. 
His departure signals the end of the Clippers’ golden age: A time when Los Angeles’ preeminent basketball team wasn’t outfitted in purple and gold. 
But the Clippers’ Griffin-era was also far from perfect. At times, the team seemed incapable of handling success, self-destructing just as often as they dazzled.
There was the Donald Sterling scandal in 2014, in which the owner was recorded making horrific, racist comments. Sterling’s actions lost the team numerous sponsors, hurt its public image and alienated players in the middle of a playoff run. They were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Semi-Finals that season. 
NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked his best to rectify the situation, fining Sterling $2.5 million and forcing him to sell the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. But the Clippers’ off-court issues persisted. 
In January 2016, Griffin punched one of the team’s equipment managers in Toronto and broke his hand. It was an ugly incident, costing him time on the court due to the injury and a suspension for his actions. Griffin’s last few years as a Clipper were marred by injuries, self-inflicted or otherwise. He missed 83 games from the 2014-15 to 2016-17 seasons. 
Locker room infighting, paired with frustration over lack of post-season success, culminated in the Clippers’ trading of Paul to the Houston Rockets this off-season. The team attempted to maintain some continuity and avoid rebuilding by inking Griffin to a five-year, $173 million mega-deal in June. 
But L.A. failed to stay relevant in the Western Conference this year. The team currently sits at ninth place in the standings — not good enough to contend for championships but not bad enough to receive a lottery pick. 
So they decided to start anew and send Griffin, the franchise’s cornerstone for a decade, to Detroit. The move makes sense in some respects, but it will likely be a while before the Clippers are relevant again. The team’s reign over L.A. has concluded just as quickly and mysteriously as it began. 
For all of Griffin’s successes with the Clippers, he failed to make it past the second round of the Playoffs. His tenure will be defined equally by how much he accomplished and how much he failed to accomplish. 
On Monday, “Lob City” officially closed its doors and Los Angeles’ basketball scene will never be the same. 
Here are a couple of things I enjoyed in sports this week: 
-UCF’s Shaquem Griffin earns an invite to the NFL Combine: I’ve spent a lot of time talking about Blake Griffin, but now it’s time to shift attention to someone who shares his namesake. Shaquem Griffin has been one of college football’s most inspirational figures over the past couple of years. At age 4, he had his left hand amputated as a result of amniotic band syndrome, but that didn’t stop him from earning a Division I scholarship, and eventually winning American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year in 2016. On Tuesday, Griffin came closer to another milestone: making it in the NFL. After a stellar week at the Senior Bowl, he received an invite to the Combine where 32 teams will get to see what the star linebacker can do. 
-JuJu’s antics: Former USC receiver-turned-NFL standout JuJu Smith-Schuster is also one of the best social media follows in all of sports (not exactly a ground breaking take, I know). He tweeted out another gem on Tuesday, posting a picture with a fan wearing a Tom Brady jersey — and he was subtly giving said fan the finger. In that moment, Smith-Schuster represented every sports fan outside of Boston.

USC held a groundbreaking ceremony Monday after closing a deal with United Airlines, which led to the renaming of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum. Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
After almost a century, USC football’s home, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, is officially no more. USC announced on Monday that the stadium will now bear a new name: the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum.
The deal is worth $69 million and took almost 16 years to forge. The name change was announced at the groundbreaking ceremony for the stadium’s recent renovations, which began at the conclusion of the NFL regular season several weeks ago. 
At the event, USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann admitted that the name change could cause “angst” among Trojan fans, but he said that the revenue provided by the naming rights deal is integral to funding the stadium’s improvement project.
“There’s a need for change at every step of the way,” Swann said. “If we’re not changing and moving forward, then we’re stagnant and other schools will pass us up, and we won’t be relevant in terms of our facilities and what we do.”
In the coming months, the stadium will undergo a $270 million renovation effort which will reduce the capacity from 93,607 to 77,500. According to the official renovation website, all upgrades are projected to be completed by the 2019 football season, with major changes finished by the 2018 season opener. 
Chief Operating Officer of the Coliseum Dan Stimmler said that many of the changes were motivated by a desire for a less confined gameday experience. 
“What we found at other stadiums was that people don’t like to just sit in their seat, and just sit there the whole game,” Stimmler said. “People like to get up, be in the sun, be in the shade, be able to walk around and have different types of food and beverage service.”
Changes include the addition of a Scholarship Club Tower to the south side of the stadium, with suites, club seats and a new concourse area to allow spectators to watch in premium seating. The press box will also be rebuilt and updated, and new concession stands will be added throughout the stadium.
Two new screens will be added to the eastern side of the stadium, and the historic white peristyle structure on the west end of the field will be remodeled to emulate its original Art Deco design. 
The field, however, will not be undergoing any major changes.
“There is some stuff that we’ve looked at as far as artificial sidelines, but nothing outrageously different as of right now,” Athletic Fields Supervisor Scott Lupold said. “The big thing will be getting it put back together after the project is done.”
The venue will also host the 2028 Olympics, which will come as a familiar return to its roots – the Coliseum was opened in 1923, and since then has hosted two Olympic games, along with two Super Bowls and a World Series.
When the Trojans take the field next football season, the stadium is expected to feel brand new, both in name and in appearance.
“I’ve been coming here for a long time, I’ve always really loved this stadium but it did need an upgrade,” Lupold said. “It’s nice to see this get done, it can only help everybody involved here at some point.”

Panelists at the event discussed how media coverage of the government and the presidency changed after the publication of the Pentagon Papers. Wanting He | Daily Trojan
Former White House Counsel to Richard Nixon John Dean and former Vice President of Legal at the Los Angeles Times Karlene Goller came to Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday evening for a panel discussion following a screening of Oscar-nominated film The Post.
The discussion was hosted by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Geoffrey Cowan and associate professor Mary Murphy. The event took place as part of Murphy’s class, JOUR 381: Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society.
The screening was presented by Annenberg and Amblin Entertainment, the company that produced The Post. According to Cowan, Amblin Entertainment presented screening of the movie at other college campuses as well. 
Dean and Goller were joined at the panel discussion by Susan Seager, a media defense lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine and a lecturer at the Gould School of Law. 
Cowan helped organize the event, and invited the speakers to be on the panel.
“Whenever we do something like this, we think about who would be wonderful people for students to be exposed to afterwards,” Cowan said. “John Dean has been nice enough to be involved with a lot of things at this school, so I reached out to him, and then I thought it would be wonderful to hear the legal perspective of how we handle cases, so we have two great lawyers here.”
Dean served as Nixon’s counsel during both the Pentagon Papers scandal, the subject of The Post and the Watergate scandal that eventually led to Nixon’s resignation. 
Dean said he participated in the panel because of his existing relationship with faculty at Annenberg.
“I come over here and teach in [professor] Bob Scheer’s class, and I’ve been doing that for about 15 years  – we’ve lost count, it’s been going on so long,” Dean said to the Daily Trojan. “So I was happy to come over and participate.”
By featuring legal counsel from both government and media organizations, the panel discussion was able to delve deeper into the issues at the center of The Post, which deal largely with the media’s relationship to the government and media law. 
Directed by Steven Spielberg, The Post focuses on Washington Post publisher Kay Graham’s (Meryl Streep) decision to print stories about the Pentagon Papers, which revealed that America was losing the Vietnam war despite government narratives claiming America was close to winning. The paper faced legal implications after publishing the story, which could have landed Graham and executive editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) in jail after being held in contempt of court. 
Following the film screening, the panelists discussed a number of issues brought up in the movie, including the relationship between journalism and the government, how women are treated in the workplace and the ethics of journalism. 
One of the major topics of discussion was how the press’ relationship to the government changed after the publication of the Pentagon Papers and the ensuing Watergate scandal. 
“The Pentagon Papers caused newspapers to start working together to define media law,” Goller said in the discussion. “That’s when media lawyers began to be a part of law school, and that’s when journalism schools started teaching media law to journalists.” 
Dean added that the Watergate scandal marked a shift in how the presidency was covered by the press. 
“[Before] Watergate, presidents were given the benefit of the doubt,” Dean said. “That changed dramatically — a lasting effect of Watergate is that the press now places the burden of proof on the presidency.”
Furthermore, Dean said after the Pentagon Papers were published, Nixon’s demeanor in the White House changed. 
“The atmosphere at the Nixon White House just went from light to dark,” Dean said. “Nixon [became] embittered and angry. It’s really quite striking.” 
The panelists also discussed how women are treated in the workplace. In The Post, Graham is the only woman in a position of power, and faces with sexism throughout the film. 
“I remember going to media law conferences in the early 2000s, and there were barely ever any other women there,” Seager said. “The men who were there wouldn’t talk to me, until I mentioned that I went to Yale and caught their attention.” 
“No one paid any attention to Graham in the male-dominated bank scene [in The Post],” Goller said. “That’s still happening today.” 
After taking questions from the audience, Murphy and Cowan ended the discussion at 8 p.m. 
Cierra Barker, a junior majoring in public relations, attended the screening and panel discussion as a student in Murphy’s class. 
“I thought it was super interesting to hear from both lawyers and a man who was in the White House at the time,” Barker said. “My biggest takeaway was how much women have progressed in the workforce, especially seeing [Graham’s] journey throughout the film and then having two female lawyers speak at the panel.”

The Agilent CoE, which will be housed in Michelson Hall, will provide students and local customers with access to scientific researchers, Agilent instrumentation and technologies all in one scientific environment.
“Agilent’s collaboration with the Michelson Center is an excellent example of how academia and industry can work together, sharing knowledge and expertise to shorten the timeline between scientific discoveries and real-world applications,” Darlene Solomon, Agilent’s senior vice president and chief technology officer, said to BusinessWire. “Convergent bioscience research requires successful collaboration across multiple disciplines — a holistic approach that is central to Agilent’s view of the future.”
Michelson Center principal investigator Valery Fokin is an essential member in Agilent’s collaboration with the state-of-the-art facility. The Fokin lab will continue to help develop collaborative drug discovery projects and focus on molecular level biological interactions and chemical reactivity. 
Projects include the chemical synthesis of screening and focused libraries and biological assay implementation as well as the development of targeted drug delivery systems, diagnostics and vaccines.
This collaboration will involve some of the world’s most influential biomedical scientists, according to BusinessWire. Their research on structural biology and cancer metastasis have led to significant advances in medical treatments and pharmaceutical drugs.
“As convergent bioscience becomes a major contributor to scientific knowledge … academic and industry collaboration will play a key role,” Stephen Bradforth, a Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences professor, said to BusinessWire. “I’m pleased that Agilent has the vision to support our efforts in this important emerging research field.”

The Undergraduate Student Government launched an initiative on Monday designed to connect low-income and work study-eligible students to two government resources: the CalFresh food stamp program and the Safetynet Wireless phone plan.
“For the past year in the advocacy branch, we’ve really tried to focus on food accessibility and affordability,” said USG Director of Community and External Affairs Mai Mizuno. “We’re trying to push for resources that students can register for or apply for [on campus].” 
Ellen Sloan, an assistant from the Department of Public Social Services, and two navigators from Safetynet Wireless were at Ronald Tutor Campus Center from 2 to 4 p.m. to help register students who qualified for the two programs. 
Students were required to bring their government-issued ID or green card, verification for their low-income status or income tax ID and social security number to confirm their eligibility. 
Mizuno worked alongside Alec Vandenberg, USG co-director of student support and advocacy, to bring these resources to students. 
“We already know [with] different data, such as the virtual food pantry data, and from programs like the late night hot meals that there is a problem with hunger,” Vandenberg said. “We know that [some students] are on food stamps.” 
CalFresh, California’s food subsidy program, provides U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents with monthly benefits available on an Electronic Benefit Transfer card at certain food stores and providers. 
Sloan helps students input their personal information in a CalFresh online application, and within three days, a DPS official will call to formally confirm their application.
For the Safetynet Wireless plan, eligible students can receive discounted or free phone plans, and they are able to receive a cell phone or SIM card upon application at USC, Sloan said.
“This [Monday] is a training run,” Vandenberg said. “We really want to make sure this can be a weekly program … if we have the capacity to extend the program to make sure we reach the students we need to reach.”
Mizuno and Vandenberg were present during the two-hour registration period to advertise other University and local resources for students, such as USC’s virtual food pantry. 
Students can visit this virtual pantry three times every semester to receive a $25 Trader Joe’s gift card. There are also three different physical food pantries at the Von KleinSmid Center, the Student Union building and Tutor Campus Center for student use.
Yet, around 20 percent of students at a four-year institution still experience food insecurity, according to a 2016 Hunger On Campus report. The initiative hopes to reduce students’ barriers to food and necessary resources, Vandenberg said.
“A big thing we’ve been hearing from students or people who apply for these programs is that it is a tedious and long process,” Mizuno said. “So to expedite that [process] for students is something that we’re really proud of doing.”

On Sunday evening, Ty Segall closed the last of three shows at the Teragram Ballroom with his Freedom Band promoting his new album Freedom’s Goblin. With the long, organic come-up that he has experienced, Segall continues to establish himself as a local legend after releasing his 10th studio album at the age of 30. For his fans, it is his consistent, prolific output of lo-fi, fast-paced rock music that has made his ascent exciting to watch.
Lamps, a local rock outfit with Segall’s wife Denee as the bassist, opened the show. Their primitive, high-energy sound featured an aggression with which Segall’s audience is quite familiar. It is no secret that Segall is an icon in the California garage rock scene, but this elevated status did not discourage him from setting up his own stage afterward. 
Segall, at first glance, was unassuming in his role as a guitar-wielding savior. The baby-faced frontman smiled widely at his bandmates and nonchalantly tuned his guitar as the audience watched with baited breath. He lowered his head enough to where his face was hidden behind his shoulder-length hair, and he loudly strummed the opening chords to “Alta” to the delight of his fans. He then followed the Freedom’s Goblin deep cut with a crowd-pleasing ballad about his beloved pup with “Fanny Dog.”
The Laguna Beach native played three consecutive nights at the Teragram Ballroom before embarking on tour with his wife Denee Segall and backing band, the Freedom Band. Matthew Philips | Daily Trojan
The biggest question at every one of Segall’s shows is how long it will take for the mosh pit to form, and on Sunday the answer was three songs. The crowd wasted no time upping the energy once Segall’s band got to the first instrumental drop in “Finger.” From that point on, the crowd’s energy was synced with the band, swaying to more cuts and moshing to aggressive garage jams.
Though he is most known for the hot, muddy rock music that gave him his start, Segall’s versatility as a musician was clearly on display that night. In one set, he managed to simultaneously channel Kurt Cobain, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop with his unique mix of songwriting chops and stage presence. 
Moreover, Segall’s band boasted an incredibly talented lineup, with bassist Mikal Cronin occasionally switching to saxophone for the latter half of the set. Cronin, drummer Charles Mootheart and guitarist Emmett Kelly all have prolific careers outside of the band as well. Segall and his band have fun too, engaging in a tongue-in-cheek “vocal experiment” that featured three of them nailing an extremely dissident melody.
Toward the end of the set, Segall gave a shout-out to his newlywed friends who were in attendance. He wished them the best and reiterated his love for them before playing his love ballad single from Freedom’s Goblin, “My Lady’s on Fire.” The song features a killer saxophone solo performed by Cronin, who wore a smile during the entire performance.
As the set closed, Segall and the Freedom Band came out to the most exciting encore an audience could hope for. The group played a medley of classic rock songs, most notably Aerosmith and Run-D.M.C.’s “Walk This Way,” The Troggs’ “Wild Thing” and Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.”
When the show ended, ears were ringing and bodies were somewhat bruised, but everyone left with smiles on their faces. The night provided a perfect send-off for the Laguna Beach native as he embarks on tour, and his fans should be plenty excited for a homecoming performance in the future.

Sunday was just like any other day, perhaps even above average compared to others. I woke up slightly hungover following a highly successful opening night of Bernstein’s Candide at LA Opera. I drank coffee at Alfred’s Coffee in West Hollywood with an old friend whom I have not seen since 2012. I went to the gym, grabbed some groceries and then went home, where I cooked myself a dinner of roasted chicken and vegetables before finishing up some assignments and heading to bed with The Deer Park by Norman Mailer.
What I did not do on Sunday, however, was watch the 60th annual Grammy Awards.
For someone who is as big a music fan as I am, I have an astonishingly low level of respect for the Recording Academy. I’m not much of a popular music guru, but even I can acknowledge that there is a disconnect between the acclaim artists garner throughout the year versus who ends up with nominations and awards. This claim is true in the classical and jazz categories as well. Furthermore, I don’t think I’ve been happy with the outcome of the awards show since 2007, when Amy Winehouse swept winning three of the four major categories. That’s also probably the last time I watched the complete telecast. Ever since, I find that the Grammys honors mediocre talent and lacks in proper racial and gender representation.
I can’t tell you many specifics of the telecast because I refused to watch it. Everything I’m reporting I read from aggregate articles from major publications. From what I can tell, based on the outcome from all categories presented at the main ceremony, only one of those winners was a woman — Alessia Cara won Best New Artist (over SZA, which is also a shock). Ed Sheeran, the only male nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance, won over the four women who dominated the category. Of the five nominees honored for Album of the Year, Lorde was the only female. She was also the only nominee in that category not asked to perform live at the show. Of the two women nominated for Song of the Year, only one was a woman of color: Julia Michaels, who is Latina. SZA, the most nominated woman (and woman of color) on this year’s ballot with five nominations, didn’t win a single award. And finally, Kesha, who has been the face of the #MeToo movement in the music industry, was honored with two nominations and, from what I can tell, executed an incredibly powerful performance of “Praying” during the telecast. However, she, too, left the Grammys empty-handed.

Commence the #GrammysSoMale movement.
Ultimately, I am unsure of the statistics regarding women at the Grammys since its inception. If I weren’t on deadline, I’d calculate my own data regarding how many of those women are women of color. Thankfully, The New York Times conducted some of this research for me. It was reported that in the last six years, of the 899 people that were nominated for Grammy Awards in all categories, only 9 percent were women. These statistics, however, don’t include women of color. Regardless, even recording artist Janelle Monae noticed this trend when she tweeted recently that “2017 was a 6-year low for female artists, only 16.8% of popular artists were women.” 
It seems that the Recording Academy nominates just enough women to appease voters, and subsequently the public. For example, Solange’s A Seat at the Table was one of the highest-reviewed albums last year. The entire album was pure art. But she only garnered one nomination (and subsequent win) for Best R&B Performance for “Cranes in the Sky.” Solange didn’t get a single nomination in any of the general categories. Was her album too politically charged for the snowflakes that make up the majority of the Recording Academy? Probably. But that’s what made it so great.
The problems with the Grammys aren’t limited to the popular categories, either. The classical categories are horrendously dominated by white men. Of the 10 conductors nominated for Best Orchestral Performance and Best Opera Recording, respectively, not a single one was female or a person of color. But that’s not necessarily the voters’ faults. It’s society’s. There just aren’t enough female conductors or conductors of color that are able to achieve the same level of success as their white counterparts. I love classical music with every fiber of my being, but I am also not the first to agree that the field is insanely whitewashed and male-dominated. How do classical musicians expect to remain competitive in a world that prefers Ed Sheeran to Ethel Smyth if they’re unwilling to give more opportunities to underrepresented communities?
Politics aside, the Recording Academy also just honors sh-tty performers and performances. Is Bruno Mars really better than those nominated (and those who weren’t)?  Is he better than SZA, or Lana Del Rey, or literally anyone with a sense of rhythm? Absolutely not. But no matter how much the internet protests over the apparent lack in representation, the Recording Academy refuses to listen. I really hope next year’s Grammys include a more diverse roster of nominees. But I’m not holding my breath. It will take many more years before there is equal representation among all. We, as musicians, must do more than wait. We must continue to fight.
But until then, I’ll be leaving the Grammy Awards on read.

Nithya Rajeev | Daily Trojan
As we enter the fourth week of the spring semester, most of us are preoccupied with feelings of unpreparedness about our upcoming midterms, primarily attributed to heavy procrastination in the weeks prior. We’re concerned about how we’re going to balance our 16-unit semesters with cooking a healthy meal every night. Now imagine, on top of all these stressors, having to balance a minimum of 15 hours of weekly training, practice and competition. I’m not talking about only USC’s famed Division I athletes — these are struggles shared by the 2,500 club and team sports athletes at USC.
According to the official USC Recreational Sports web page, the University boasts 58 student-run club teams. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that this athletic aspect is one of the University’s standout deciding factors for prospective students. I still vividly remember stepping on this campus for the first time, and listening to my admissions tour guide boast about the availability of sports and athletic activities for people of all skill levels, as we walked past Cromwell Field. Having played tennis for more than half of my life, the opportunity to compete at just one level below that of the Division I team was one of the primary motivating factors for me to attend USC.
However, the harsh reality of competing in such an organization became evident very quickly. Contrary to the benefits Division I players and teams receive, members of highly competitive club teams hardly receive any support, if they receive any at all. Despite spending several hours each week practicing to be the best, these club athletes are not granted any support, whether it be through earlier class registration or proper practice spaces on campus. The club council website itself says that the athletes compete “at the highest levels” — yet why are they so far below D-I athletes in terms of benefits? 
If students are held back from participating in club sports because of finances, then that is a loss for the University as a whole. USC greatly benefits from the contributions these clubs make to the social atmosphere, so choosing not to support them is a lose-lose decision. This is not to say that Division I athletes are not deserving of the benefits they receive — because they are. However, club athletes should also be allotted some support by the University so they can pursue athletic opportunities at USC.

For example, take our award-winning Bollywood dance team, Zeher. In their eight years of competing, they have placed in the top three at several top-tier national dance competitions, including Bollywood Berkeley and Tufaan, a contest in Illinois. While many of us were still winding down our winter vacations, members of Zeher, much like the Division I athletes who compete in the spring, were on campus spending up to 10 hours daily practicing for a week. 
The problem, however, is that the team doesn’t even have its own place to practice. On several occasions throughout the semester, DPS restricted Zeher from practicing in their usual spots — Taper Hall and Mudd Hall — because security had no prior knowledge of their presence. In addition, the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance cannot give the group any studio space due to the team’s club status. Put simply, it is difficult to justify having a university team compete at a national level without being given a consistent practice space in one of our on-campus dance studios. 
But another issue extends far beyond this, and applies to nearly every club team fostered on campus: monetary support. For a majority of club teams, each member is required to pay dues within the first few weeks of joining, which is supposedly expected to cover the costs of travel, uniforms and supplies for the entire academic year. However, with prices of accommodations and rental spaces continuing to rise each year, these dues have not been sufficient. Captains and executive board members of club teams are saddled with the burden of finding options that fall within, or close to, the budget determined by the amount of dues collected — options which are often uncomfortable and inconvenient. The University does provide a $500 stipend per semester, but that is barely enough to cover the cost of uniform, let alone travel or accomodations.
Considering the contributions club sports and teams make to the USC community, it’s a shame that the University is selling them short. Division I or not, they are student-athletes nonetheless. It’s time the University matches its words with actions and tangibly supports the organizations it reveres during the admission months. We must respect the spectrum of athletic talent and capabilities and support the organizations we otherwise use as selling points.

As of Friday, USC wrapped up its Diversity and Inclusion Awareness Week, in which the University hosted a series of seminars and roundtable discussions catered toward providing students and staff alike an opportunity to develop skills in addressing diversity, as well as an outlet to share dialogue. The seminar and roundtables addressed topics including mental health, diversity in science, approaches to opening discussion, inclusion in the LGBTQ community and the #MeToo movement.
The existence of Diversity and Inclusion Awareness Week stands as a testament to the University’s commitment to providing the best education for its students. At a time when identity and inclusion are central issues in today’s political climate, USC successfully maintains an open climate primed for expanding the minds of future leaders. There is a significant difference between promoting an idea and promoting the discussion of an idea. College campuses should not be places where controversial ideas or difficult topics are shied away from, but instead should be spaces where students can cultivate opinions through debate and discussion. 
But in such a chaotic political climate, exposing students to the aforementioned “controversial ideas” may not be so simple. Colleges across the country dominated the news this past year with outcry against various speakers. At UC Berkeley in September, when conservative commentator Ben Shapiro was scheduled to speak, the school ended up in a lockdown with multiple arrests and spent more than half a million dollars on security. Similarly, in October at the University of Florida, the arrival of National Policy Institute President Richard Spencer incited enough student protests to cost the school half a million dollars in security, as well as shut down half of campus. 
USC’s own campus approaches discussing controversial subjects in a different manner — one that is much more effective. Rather than hosting singular figures to talk at students, the University creates topic oriented panels to provoke thought. The recent Diversity and Inclusion Awareness Week featured panels like “I Don’t See Colors and Other Myths of Cultural Competency,” “Minority Report 2: Reflections on Race Relations in America” and “Faculty Conversations on Diversity: Inclusion, Microaggressions, and Cultural Competence.” 
The University could have hosted a single speaker to provide perspective on these subjects, but by turning a topic from a presentation into a conversation, the issue becomes more malleable. In civilized discussion, differing opinions are not personal attacks to stage protests about; rather, they are launching points for informed debate. For instance, when the University held “Minority Report 2,” the aforementioned panel on race in America — a certainly heavy topic of discussion — last Thursday, it opened up space for students to develop their ideas  and world views through give and take. 
In addition to the past week’s events, other schools within the University contributed to students’ enrichment. Last semester, for example, the Unruh Institute of Politics held a conversation between former president of the NRA and editor-at-large at the Washington Times, David Keene and Unruh’s own director, Robert Shrum. The conversation opened an exchange of ideas on gun control. By listening to differing opinions on an issue, students have the chance to consider alternative perspectives and develop their own. 
The difference between USC’s events and those on other campuses is the approachability of the format. USC recognizes the various corners of contention in today’s culture, and in response, opens an opportunity for students to learn through discussion-based lectures. Biased and brutish people will always exist at universities, but intolerance can be treated with understanding developed through education and dialogue. 
Perhaps USC President C. L. Max Nikias said it best in his 2016 State of the University Address: “With our great diversity, we must ensure that we remain a university to access, to opportunity, to inclusivity.” 
USC’s drive to provide an open dialogue on difficult subjects is in the best interest of the students, and thus the University itself. In turn, it is up to the students to take advantage of these dialogues to fuel understanding and collaboration toward bettering ourselves and the world around us.

The early months of the 2017-18 campaign wreaked havoc on the USC men’s basketball program. Returning with all five of last year’s starters and adding three key recruits, USC appeared poised for its best season in decades and sustained success for years to come. However, the September scandal involving former assistant coach Tony Bland rocked the program to its core, leaving questions surrounding two players’ eligibility and even the job security of head coach Andy Enfield. USC hired former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh to investigate the program’s NCAA compliance. 
Senior guard Jordan McLaughlin reaches for a layup against the Cal Bears. In that game, he recorded a .429 field goal percentage. Deanie Chen | Daily Trojan
In November, minutes before USC’s season tip-off, the program announced sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton would sit out indefinitely as a consequence for his embroilment in the Bland investigation. 
The Trojans ranked 10th in the AP Preseason Poll — their highest starting mark since 1974 — and played well in their first couple games, including an overtime win at Vanderbilt when senior captain guard Jordan McLaughlin scored a career-high 35 points.
Then, USC started a brutal stretch of losses against Texas A&M, SMU and Oklahoma. The Trojans continued to sputter throughout December, losing to Princeton and Washington at home.
However, they had some bright moments, too. On Christmas, the Trojans won the Diamond Head Classic in Hawaii, and McLaughlin tied a longstanding Pac-12 record for assists in a game with 19 versus UCSB on Dec. 17. 
Nevertheless, for the AP voters and  USC basketball fans, the losses certainly drowned out the preseason expectations for the program. On top of it all forward Taeshon Cherry, USC’s highest-ranked recruit in a decade, decommitted from USC and has since committed to rival ASU. 
Perhaps morale bottomed out after the Stanford loss on Jan. 7. After USC blew a 15-point lead in ten minutes, McLaughlin scored a reverse lay-up to give USC a 2-point lead with less than two seconds on the clock. Tragically, Stanford’s freshman guard Daejon Davis scored a magical 55-foot shot as time expired to gift the Cardinal a victory.
In the moment, his half-court heave seemed to suck the life out of Trojan basketball. Forget top-10 aspirations. After a 2-2 start to conference play, even an NCAA Tournament bid seemed in jeopardy. 
Since, the Trojans have gone 6-0. In the past three weeks, the Trojans beat Utah for the first time since 2012. On the road, they swept the Oregon schools and won in Eugene for the first time since 2009. They are second place in the Pac-12, a half-game behind No. 9 Arizona and two games ahead of their next opponent, perennial rivals, UCLA. They appear safe off the NCAA Tournament bubble and again received votes in Monday’s AP Poll.
So, what changed? How did the Trojans turn the season around?
One could cite Enfield’s decision to switch the rotation. Over the last six games, redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron has started in place of sophomore Jonah Mathews. Over that span, Mathews, who had been averaging 8.5 points per game, has led USC in scoring twice. Undoubtedly, he has freshened USC’s bench, which on Sunday outscored UC Berkeley’s bench 31-4, even though the usual sixth man Nick Rackocevic had to start in place of an injured Bennie Boatwright.
“Our players are resilient,” Enfield said of his players’ adaptability in new roles.
McLaughlin added that coming off the bench gives Mathews, an underclassman, the ability to see a bit of the other team’s strategy before he has to make key decisions. 
“That helped me when I was coming off the bench as a freshman,” McLaughlin said.
High energy on defense is another reason for the team’s turnaround. After bouncing back from the Washington loss, Enfield said, “The team was simply tired of playing below its potential.” 
After allowing Washington to shoot 67 percent from the floor, USC has held its opponents to 43 percent from the floor.
“We’re playing great defense. In man-to-man and in zone,” Enfield said after Sunday’s game. “We are forcing a lot of turnovers, which gives us a chance to stay in the game until we start to shoot the ball better.” 
But the paramount reason for USC’s outburst of energy is not tactical. Rather, USC has found its identity through the trials and tribulations of the Bland scandal. Indeed, the same events which initially deflated the team have become a source of inspiration. Since sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton was officially ruled ineligible for the season on Jan. 11, the Trojans have played with greater unity and purpose. 
Without hope of Melton returning, the players and coaches finally realized that their current lineup would be the one available for the rest of the season. Although not ideal, the finality of the decision to keep Melton ineligible has strengthened everyone’s resolve to perform well knowing that a knight is not going to rescue them in the midnight hour.
Some of USC’s best have funneled their resentment about the Melton decision into more passionate play on the court, for better or worse. Junior forward Chimezie Metu, for instance, has always had a reputation as a violent player thanks to his rim-rattling slam dunks. Recently, though, his play has become noticeably unsettled, as he has received three technical fouls and an ejection since conference play began. Metu is one of Melton’s closest friends; his temper could suggest that he is playing to avenge his pal. 
Junior forward Bennie Boatwright, too, has engaged in some horseplay, for which he has garnered a couple technical fouls and also an ejection. Although Metu and Boatwright’s comportment does not necessarily reflect well on USC or add to the Trojans’ win probability, their rough style of play has galvanized the esprit de corps of  their teammates and fans.
“When [Metu] is screaming, he gets us all fired up,” redshirt junior guard Shaqquan Aaron said.
When the Trojans take the court, there is a sense of USC basketball versus the world. With some conference foes elevating their smack talk against the Trojans or circling the USC matchup on their calendar, USC could have backed down, intimidated. Instead, they have harnessed their rivals’ negativity. The veteran team — used to the underdog label —  started to feel at home when their dismal start to the season pushed their backs against the wall, and existential questions about the program cast doubt on the entire legitimacy of this squad.
“Our chemistry has improved throughout the season,” Aaron said. “It is better to have your losses at the beginning.”
With Melton gone for good this year, the Trojans are playing with an intensity they lacked earlier in the year. Although he still attends each game, Melton, in some sense, has become a martyr for USC, motivating the Trojans. The rest of the team does not want to look at him and think of what could have been. They are determined to win, hell or high water, Melton or not.

The Trojan track and field program went to the Razorback Invitational in Arkansas last weekend with high hopes, with the women’s team ranked No. 4 and the women’s team ranked No. 14 in the country. The team did not disappoint, impressing against elite competition from schools like LSU, Arkansas and Florida State. 
Sophomore hurdler and sprinter Anna Cockrell took 2nd place in the women’s 60m hurdles with a time of 8.06. Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Redshirt junior Dior Hall flashed her blazing speed for the second week in a row in the 60m hurdles, winning first place in a follow up to her second place finish at last week’s meet in Albuquerque with a time of 7.98 seconds. She was followed by teammate sophomore Anna Cockrell, who finished second after posting a time of 8.06 seconds. 
For the second week in a row, the USC women’s 4×400 women’s relay team secured first place, as Kendall Ellis (senior), Cockrell, Deanna Hill (senior) and Kyra Constantine (sophomore) put up a time of 3:31.25. Randall Cunningham picked up his first 1st place finish of the season in the men’s high jump with an impressive height of 2.25m, improving on his 3rd place finish at last week’s meet.
Anna Cockrell also finished in 3rd place in the women’s 200m dash with a time of 23.16. Freshman teammate Twanisha Terry made USC history with an 8th place finish, as her 23.43 second time set a USC freshman women’s indoor record for the event. Junior Lyndsey Lopes also scored well in the penathalon, finishing 4th with a score of 3,921. 
Sophomore TJ Brock finished 2nd in the men’s 60m dash once again, setting a new personal record with a time of 6.64 seconds. In the women’s shot put, redshirt senior Breanna Jemison finished in 3rd with a best throw of 15.73 meters. Senior Eric Sloan placed second in the men’s triple jump, posting a distance of 16.33m. 
The strong performances didn’t end there for the Trojans. Senior Nicholas Ponzio threw for a distance of 18.68m in the men’s shot put, placing 4th in the event. A time of 7.94 seconds in the men’s 60m hurdles secured redshirt junior Marquis Morris a solid 5th place finish in the event final. Senior Ricky Morgan Jr. placed first in the men’s 400m dash, running the lap in 46.80 seconds. In the women’s 60m dash, three Trojans claimed back-to-back-to-back spots from 3rd to 5th place. Respectively, the finishes were posted by freshman Twanisha Terry, sophomore Anglerne Annelus and Hill. Terry led the three with a time of 7.27, followed by Annelus’s 7.30 and Hill’s 7.32. Constantine ran well with a time of 52.77 seconds in the women’s 400m dash.
The Trojans will have little time to reflect on their successes at the Razorback invitational as they focus their attention on the upcoming Tiger Paw invitational hosted by Clemson. The team will look to build off their performances from the last two weeks as they approach their third meet of the indoor season.

Looking to improve its No. 3 ranking, the women’s water polo team clinched two dominant victories over the weekend at the Cal Baptist Mini Invitational on Saturday. The pair of victories over Cal Baptist and Pomona-Pitzer highlighted the dual strength of the Trojans, which remained smothering on defense while lighting up the boards on offense to create a well-balanced attack throughout the day.

USC started the day against the hosts, Cal Baptist, churning out a shutout victory to end with a 20-0 score. Junior goalkeeper Amanda Longan shone throughout her second clean sheet of the season, recording 12 saves to lock down the defense.
The victory highlighted the strength of the Trojans’ underclassmen, who contributed 70 percent of the goals scored against Cal Baptist and a majority of the scores netted on the day. It was another marquee day for freshman defenseman Paige Hauschild, who notched 4 goals in the Cal Baptist game. Sophomore drivers Elise Stein and Kelsey McIntosh also contributed 4 goals apiece in separate games, with Stein starring in the opening game of the day and McIntosh delivering against Pomona-Pitzer. 
Sophomore driver Denise Mammolito also served up a hat trick in the Cal Baptist victory, while freshmen utility player Nadia Pavlovich and defenseman Verica Bakoc scored 2 apiece and freshman 2-meter woman Nina Ceklic found the net for the first time this season.
The strength of the underclassman roster answered questions for the USC offense coming into the season after losing a sizeable senior class at the end of last year. Led by Hauschild, who has already been a star for the U.S. national team on the international circuit, the team is finding a balance of leaders between experienced upperclassmen and young guns.
The game against Pomona-Pitzer snapped the team’s season-opening shutout streak, which lasted just under 81 minutes to start the 2018 season. However, the Trojans were still able to limit their opponent to only 3 goals in four quarters of action with senior goalie Victoria Chamorro playing the first three frames in goal. The team took a 14-0 lead by the half, but allowed its first goal of the season on a six-on-five advantage in the first minute of the second half.
Despite allowing 3 goals, an aggressive attack allowed the Trojans to remain squarely in control of the game, with Mammolito notching another hat trick to tally a total of 21 goals. Senior goalie Nicola Gonzales took over for the final frame of action, recording two saves to close out the victory.
The Trojans are now 3-0 on the season, but their play so far has been limited to this weekend’s pair of unranked opponents and an opening game against No. 23 LMU. As the team takes a weeklong break from action, they will prepare for the Triton Invitational in February, which will usher in a month of ranked opponents ahead of the MPSF tournament.

When it comes to women in sports, there are few who I look up to more than Jemele Hill. 
Admittedly, I’m not a huge fan of sports broadcasting. There are a few too many (read: way, way, way too many) self-involved commentators to keep me interested in the business. I’ve never understood why so many of my sports-loving friends eat up anything and everything that Stephen A. Smith spouts, or why Bill Walton’s pointless anecdotes somehow garner so much attention and affection throughout Pac-12 basketball fans.
In the many years since I first started watching sports, I’ve watched what I consider to be a devolution of sports broadcast journalism. Especially in the wake of the “pivot to video,” companies are more likely to fixate on tabloid topics that bait viewers — cue some sort of sound byte from LaVar Ball, or yet another debate about whether or not Tom Brady is the GOAT. At this point, I can’t stand it.
This distaste was probably bred by my parents, who are perhaps even more particular than I am when it comes to television commentary. When I was young, they muted the television whenever we watched Chiefs games in favor of the voices of Kevin Harlan and Len Dawson, and the celebratory “Touch-dowwwwwwn Kansas City” cheer came to define my childhood. My dad has taken to watching SportsCenter with the sound off, watching the highlights while foregoing “all that yapping,” as he has called it more than once. And whenever we watch a Kansas basketball game, I’m pretty much guaranteed to get an earful about how horrible the announcers are — especially if, God forbid, Dicky V has been selected to call the game.
I’m perhaps not as picky as my parents are, but I do struggle with the state of many broadcast shows. Unless you’ve lucked out and stumbled upon a 30-for-30 rerun, most ESPN shows possess the substance of a potato chip, regurgitating the same couple of stories and recaps for hours at a time while completely ignoring coverage of important topics — women’s sports, NFL assault convictions and the like — supposedly because that isn’t what interests viewers.
At this point, I’ve realized, most of the broadcasters who I prefer to listen to are women. Maybe it’s the fact that most of the men who grind my gears the most are the ones who feed off that machismo swagger of the Man Who Loves Sports, rather than sticking to the stats. Or maybe it’s because the sexism of the sports world only allows the women who are truly the very best-of-the-best-of-the-best to rise to the top of the broadcast industry.
Regardless of the reason, I have, on more than one occasion, yelled at a friend or family member to shut their mouths while Holly Rowe is providing a 30-second byte of information from the sidelines. I’m rarely out of class during Katie Nolan’s weekly show, “Garbage Time,” but I always find time to watch it that night so I can tank up on her tireless wit. 
And, of course, there’s Jemele Hill. She’s almost unmatched when it comes to her ability to balance humor with raw edge to create sports commentary that is both meaningful and thoughtful. Hill provides the kind of analysis that I often feel is missing from modern sports broadcasts, and whether she’s covering sports on or off the field, she brings humor and heart, something sorely missing among men shouting over one another.
This is why I actually audibly cheered when Hill earned a slot as a SportsCenter anchor last February, and why I almost threw my phone across the room when I saw the news this weekend that her brief stint had come to a close. Like many others, I figured at first that it was some sort of behind-the-scenes scandal — ESPN had, after all, suspended Hill last year for using her platform to make political statements. 
When she announced that she had made the decision to turn to print, Hill earned my ultimate respect. She’s now headed to The Undefeated, an ESPN publication that covers sports, race and culture. Her presence will be a perfect fit that will boost a website stocked with important coverage.
Yet, although I eagerly await her return to writing, Hill’s departure feels like a huge hit for sports broadcasting. For one, it’s a loss for the multitudes of young women who dream of making it in sports and have far too few faces to look up to, and that loss will hit the population of young black women who are even more aggressively marginalized. 
Few women possess the clout that Hill held during her time on SportsCenter, and having the success of a woman of color broadcast every night at 6 p.m. EST provided more inspiration than even she could probably understand. I know that feeling all too well, because I constantly look to Kate Fagan — one of very few out LGBT women in sports journalism — for inspiration.
And Hill’s voice was also one of few that cut through the bull of sports media, which often feels like more of a reality show than anything else. As the “pivot to video” phenomenon continues to grow, many have pointed out that broadcasters are pulling punches to provide more fluffy content — Fox Sports, for instance, failed to mention the sexual assault case of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar once throughout the trial and ensuing NCAA investigation. In this climate of lackluster content, Hill’s willingness to question the status quo came as a breath of fresh air.
At the end of the day, I can’t be anything but happy for Hill, who remains one of my favorite journalists. Her work in the industry began in print, and her return to writing is expected to be exciting and scathing. 
Hill took a lot of heat, mainly because she’s a black woman who is completely unafraid of what anyone has to say about her or her opinions. I’m sure that heat will follow her to The Undefeated, along with the Twitter horde that constantly spams her with everything from insults to threats of violence. 
But I hope she knows that she’ll also be followed by many fans — especially women like me — who will look to her for guidance when navigating the sports world. The Undefeated gained a powerful asset this weekend, and I personally can’t wait to see where Hill goes from here.
