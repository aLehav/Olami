Can anyone live without imported groceries? Without a car? Even without electricity? That’s what Colin Beavan decided to find out. In the fall of 2006, Beavan, his wife and his baby daughter began a year-long experiment to live off the grid in New York City. Beavan, who chronicled the year in a blog, runs a gamut of criticism and praise, with people calling him a charlatan and a hippie liberal. The film never comes across as a piece of environmental propaganda but instead is a study of a family and their dedication to an experiment. The interplay between Beavan and his wife Michelle, a latte addict and shopaholic, gives the film a romantic and humorous twist. The DVD comes with deleted scenes, and the Q&A session from Sundance with the Beavans and the directors of the documentary,provides a personal insight to the inception and making of the film.

Steven Soderbergh’s four-and-a-half-hour-long cinematic epic centered around the life of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara stars the ever-electrifying Benecio del Toro in the coveted title role. Soderbergh, the Academy Award-winning writer-director whose filmography bounces between introspective indie dramas and socially conscious biopics, chose to take an achronological approach when documenting Guevara’s involvement in the Cuban revolution and the thwarted insurgency in Bolivia, interspersing circuitous moments along the film’s overall timeline. Although Che, which was screened in theaters last January in two separate parts because of its length, gained favorable reviews from American film critics, the film was largely overlooked on the 2009 awards circuit. Del Toro, however, secured the Best Actor Award from the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Both parts were released on bare-bones DVDs last year, but Soderbergh took his time retooling with deleted scenes and other extras for The Criterion Collection, which finds both two-hour parts released on a special 3-disc Blu-ray set.

Death in Love
Rating: R
Length: 97 min.
Now available
Writer-director Boaz Yakin’s Death in Love, an updated Holocaust drama, explores how a family’s tragic past carries over and impacts the relationships that develop in the future. The non-linear independent drama, which was released limitedly last July and received mixed reviews from critics, follows two wayward brothers — a sex-addicted con artist and a brilliant yet disturbed pianist — and their varied ways of coping with their Holocaust-survivor mother’s erratic behavior throughout their childhood. While exploring the family’s modern dynamic, the movie intercuts flashbacks of their mother’s scandalous relationship with a Nazi doctor. Death in Love stars acclaimed British actress Jacqueline Bisset as the emotionally tortured mother, and Josh Lucas and Lukas Haas as her slightly unhinged sons. The film is being released in DVD and Blu-ray format.

The Invention of Lying
Rating: PG-13
Length: 99 min.
Now available
Ricky Gervais’ most recent U.S. vehicle, The Invention of Lying, comes to DVD this week, with the host of last Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards playing the only man on Earth capable of deceit. Gervais, perhaps best known for his role in BBC’s original The Office, directs in addition to starring alongside Jennifer Garner and Rob Lowe. The movie drew criticism for relying on what was essentially one protracted joke — Mark Bellison (Gervais) says something crazy and the gullible citizens of the world believe that crazy something — but the concept behind the movie is sound. Bellison is a down-and-out writer who introduces the first falsehood into the world when he successfully withdraws $800 from an account containing only $300 (the bank teller dismisses the lower figure as a system error). Having discovered just how advantageous untruths can be, Bellison proceeds to exploit the naïvete of a world soft with gullibility. The jokes hinge mostly on the desperation of the average man to bed better-than-average-looking women, but, surprisingly, the gag doesn’t get unbearably stale.

“Guess what’s in it,” I told my dad as he licked the spoon and pondered my new batch of lime pudding. “There are only three ingredients.”
The lime flavor was obvious, and I had already told him about my addition of the natural sweetener Stevia. 
“What could the third be?” he wondered. “Milk?”
“Nope. Avocado.”
In fact, the thick-as-mortar, rich-as-sin pudding was not only devoid of dairy, but none of its delicious ingredients had been heated above 118 degrees. And all it took to prepare was a blender.
The lime pudding was my first experiment with raw food, and, judging by the empty bowl before my meat-and-potatoes-bred father, I consider it a success.
Raw food is exactly what it sounds like — food that has been left uncooked. Because of celebrity hype and the growing number of gourmet raw restaurants, the concept of raw food has edged closer to the mainstream but only in vague references.
Based on one theory that heating food to a temperature above 118 degrees destroys beneficial enzymes and vitamin content, raw food diets are often seen as extreme and confining when, in fact, the opposite is true.
Firstly, raw food does not have to be vegan; it doesn’t even have to be vegetarian — think sashimi. And while the options are certainly weighted towards fresh vegetables and lots of greens, eating raw does not necessarily mean salads. And of course, “going raw” is not a lifetime commitment. Spurred on by anything from health issues to simple curiosity, many people who eat raw food incorporate it as one facet of their lives, not as an altogether “alternative lifestyle.”
For Gena Hamshaw, the creator of popular raw-help blog Choosing Raw, switching to a raw diet fixed many of her lifelong digestive problems.
“I just wanted to experiment with it for a couple of days and see how I felt,” Hamshaw said. “I did it for a week … and what I was finding was that my digestion was getting better, and I felt terrific and really energetic.”
Hamshaw, however, is a high-raw foodist, meaning she does not eat entirely raw and doesn’t see the need to. To her and others, eating raw is about feeling good, not sticking to a rulebook.
“Because I never intended to give up all cooked foods, I’ve managed to keep them in my life in a healthy way,” Hamshaw said.
Her desire to showcase raw foodism as a healthy addition to one’s lifestyle, and not as a rigid dogma, also led her to become a nutrition counselor. Hamshaw’s clientele includes many who just want to make a few vegan or raw upgrades to their diet.
The one thing most people who switch will attest to, however, is how good it makes their bodies feel.
“More than anything, it was the energy,” Sarma Melngailis said, owner of Forbes-lauded New York raw restaurant Pure Food and Wine. “I felt really clear in a way that’s hard to explain. My skin felt better, I slept better and I had really bad PMS that went away all of a sudden.”
While high energy is a great selling point for any diet, Melngailis’ restaurant is known not only because of the benefits of raw food but also for its gourmet dining. Pure Food and Wine’s reputation for beautiful and tasty dishes draws both raw foodists and curious passers-by and is turning what could be perceived as an alienating lifestyle choice into a respected style of cuisine.
“I’d rather put [raw food] out there from the perspective of a restaurant,” Melngailis said. “Most of our chefs come from traditional culinary backgrounds … and with that perspective can use those ingredients and techniques to cook with raw food.”
And while it might take some getting used to, raw recipes give traditional cooked food some interesting, uncooked twists.
Vegetables such as zucchini spiral through an extruder to create “pasta.” Nuts and seed purees become thickening agents for rich “pâtés” and decadent “cheesecakes.” Avocados and bananas stand in as the creamy bases of puddings and soups, and dates and figs serve as binders and sweeteners. A raw dish doesn’t have to be bland. Pure Food and Wine dishes up entrees such as Sweet Pickled Beet and Rosemary Cashew Chevre Ravioli and desserts such as Chocolate Passion Fruit Tart.
Aside from elaborate dinners and decadent desserts from professional chefs, however, Hamshaw agrees that raw food is all about the veggies.
“All you need to do is eat vegetables and drink juice,” Hamshaw said. “Eat some nuts, eat some grains, and it’s very simple. The main thing is vegetables, vegetables, vegetables.”
For that reason, staples of the raw diet are green juices and smoothies, which allow one to slurp down a whole vitamin-rich garden for breakfast. The most useful tools of the trade are a simple blender and food processor, which can churn out everything from smoothies to nut “cheeses.”
But at the same time, even Hamshaw disagrees with a 100 percent raw diet for most people. Patrice Barber, the USC University Park Health Center’s registered dietician, also believes that a student going raw could easily hit a nutritional wall.
“Veggies, nuts, fruit, sprouted grains and edamame all have a lot to offer, and most people would benefit from having more of them,” Barber said. “However, that’s a short list of foods with limited variety. In general, the more foods a person includes in their diet, the easier it is to meet their nutrient needs. A diet with just these foods would present a considerable challenge in meeting your nutritional needs.”
While trying raw food does not equal going raw, those contemplating it as a lifestyle should be mindful of their bodies. Raw diets are easily adaptable to specific likes and needs but, because everyone’s digestion and nutritional needs are different, they are not for everyone. Whether or not you choose to incorporate raw into your diet, adding a smoothie to your breakfast or having a salad with your dinner can only be a good thing.
“The fact that I wasn’t trying really hard to go 100 percent raw allowed the journey to be sort of a happy accident,” Hamshaw says. “It’s all about trying small things and seeing where they take you.”

The peskiest of all essay prompts in English classes is surely the “keyword” essay, in which students are asked to produce five-plus pages on a single word or image of seeming importance from a given work. Such pointlessness typifies the sort of mechanical exercises that too often spoil educations in English and literary criticism.
Limited run · A Noise Within has brought back its popular production of Waiting for Godot for a brief ten-performance engagement. Joel Swetow (left) and Robertson Dean reprise their roles as Gogo and Didi. - Photos courtesy of A Noise Within 
But in certain, exceedingly rare circumstances, a work does lend itself to this kind of reductive analysis, and the exercise can actually be somewhat worthwhile. One of those works is Samuel Beckett’s masterpiece, Waiting for Godot — his English translation of his own originally French play — subtitled “A Tragicomedy in Two Acts.”
If Waiting of Godot had a keyword, it would of course be the word “nothing” — not surprisingly, the first word we hear in the play. Estragon (Joel Swetow) is trying desperately to take off his boot and, failingly, says, “Nothing to be done.”
That’s Beckett self-reflexively warning us that over the course of the next two hours, nothing indeed will be done.
This was my second time seeing Waiting for Godot at A Noise Within, a small venue full of big talent. The play was brought back for the classical repertory company’s 2009-2010 season “by popular demand.” Apparently, theatre of the absurd is still alive and well in these parts: This is the third consecutive year ANW has reprised this acclaimed production.
We should not fault ANW for continually restaging Godot, if only because the more people who see it, the better. And if it means easy money for this outstanding company, which is in the process of moving to a permanent location, so much the better.
Of course, the play itself is not particularly easy to enjoy. But then again, I don’t think it was meant to be. When I saw it the first time, I recommended it to Daily Trojan readers and I would recommend it again — but for a few new, and I should think better articulated, reasons.
Virginia Woolf once wrote, “If we could banish all such preconceptions when we read, that would be an admirable beginning.”
The same is true of watching theater, where preconceptions — or, in this case, expectations — are poison.
Waiting for Godot has often been called one of most important English-language plays of the past century. Let scholars spout off such fatuities; whether or not it’s true is besides the point. We can’t think like that when we sit down for a performance. We’ll invariably be let down and then feel bad about ourselves for not “getting it.”
Waiting for Godot is — surprise, surprise — an exercise in waiting. Estragon and his old friend Vladimir (Robertson Dean), who call each other Didi and Gogo, wait near a rock and a tree for Mr. Godot; it is no real spoiler at this point to say that he never shows. For two hours — which for them is two days — Estragon and Vladimir pass the time by walking, talking, sitting, standing, eating, laughing, crying and embracing.
So many adjectives have been used to describe this play — minimalist, absurdist, existentialist, avant-garde, experimental — that we risk losing it amid the endless wordage. What it is is elemental, a naked look at what it’s like to wait for something great and to lose oneself in the process.
Who is Godot? Who are Pozzo (Mitchell Edmonds) and Lucky (Mark Bramhall), the two strangers who cross paths with Estragon and Vladimir on the first day and return the second day with no knowledge of the original encounter? Who are the boys (Owen Scholar) who are supposedly sent by Godot? Is it only one boy?
We leave Waiting for Godot with far more questions than answers but that is where the play succeeds most brilliantly in keeping us riveted. Watching this play is not a passive experience; there must be  constant audience engagement for the play to be worthwhile. It is not easy to do — and can at times be downright challenging — but the result is worth it: a truly personal and personalized experience.
Is Waiting for Godot really a play about nothing? On average, the word “nothing” is repeated once every three minutes for the full two hours. We can never escape the void.
But that is Beckett’s ultimate challenge with this play: to make something out of nothing. In the end, Estragon and Vladimir can’t, but in their failure perhaps Beckett wants us to succeed.

Even the storm couldn’t stop students from trying to save money on books.
USG and CALPIRG hosted a bookswap Tuesday, an event aimed at helping students get their textbooks without emptying the bank.
“I think it’ll save me tons of money from buying [books] from the bookstore because they overcharge for their books,” said Andrew Park, a sophomore majoring in economics.
The swap, which continues Wednesday, lets students name their price for books they are selling, rather than receive the typically small amounts given for book buyback at the bookstore.
“I think that students really need cheaper textbooks and so any way we can provide an opportunity for them, students are going to take advantage of it,” said Andrew Matson, USG’s director of academic affairs.
Students wanting to swap textbooks can bring unwanted books and state their price range. Because it can be difficult to assess how much a book costs, Matson suggested researching the price beforehand. Matson likened the bookswap to a free market enterprise, where books are competitively sold.
USG hopes to eventually offer the bookswap in partnership with the bookstore.
“I really hope the bookstore sees this as an opportunity rather than an opponent,” Matson said.
Daniel Archer, director of the bookstore, said although the book store has not considered a book swap, he found the idea interesting.
“I suppose it will be successful,” Archer said. “I would like to be able to see what that price would be in comparison to what they would have gotten back…during our buyback.”

The USC swimming and diving team split up and competed in three different competitions over the weekend — the UCLA Diving Invite, the SMU Classic Invite and the California Grand Prix — with each group achieving successful results.
USC’s diving team competed at the UCLA Diving Invite on Saturday where sophomore Harrison Jones won the 1-meter with 323.30 points and the platform with 364.05 points. Freshman Ariel Rittenhouse won the 3-meter springboard with 342.40 points and junior Christine Petrilli was the highest scoring woman of Troy on platform, coming in fourth with 216.15 points.
Daily Trojan | Sunil Murali
In Dallas, eight of USC’s fastest men swam at the SMU Classic Invite on Friday and Saturday against some of the nation’s top teams including Florida, Michigan and SwimMAC. USC’s two biggest victories were in the 200-yard freestyle and 800-yard freestyle relays.
The sprint freestyle relay featured senior Zoltan Povazsay, freshman Clement Lefert and sophomores Jeff Daniels and Pat White. The men won in a time of 1:21.05, beating the national record holding team, SwimMAC.
The 800-yard relay included junior Richard Charlesworth, Lefert, White and Povazsay, winning with a time of 6:30.54.
“The fact that we beat both Florida and Michigan, which are top eight NCAA teams, was significant to our improvement as a team,” coach Dave Salo said.
Salo considered Lefert’s victory in the 200-yard butterfly the best individual performance of the meet. The Frenchman scored a season best time and improved on his NCAA consideration ‘B’ time with a 1:44.28. Povazsay came second in the 500-yard freestyle (4:23.63), and Charlesworth clocked his first NCAA ‘B’ cut as a Trojan (4:24.89).
USC came 5th overall scoring 260 points.
Meanwhile, the rest of the USC swim team was racing hard at the California Grand Prix in Long Beach, Calif. on Friday and Saturday.
Junior Presley Bard, a transfer from Indiana, further established herself as one of USC’s top female competitors and came 5th in both the 100-yard freestyle (49.44) and the 200-yard backstroke (1:56.75). Both of these times were season bests for Bard and scored her two NCAA consideration “B” cuts.
USC’s female flyers dominated in the 200-yard butterfly final with sophomore Katinka Hosszu taking first with a 1:53.99, junior Lyndsay DePaul touching second in a 1:55.45, freshman Yumi So coming in fourth (1:58.88) and sophomore Tanya Krisman taking seventh place (2:01.52).
Freshman distance star Haley Anderson was third in the 500-yard freestyle, clocking a 4:45.05.
“We are looking forward to having a great Pac-10 meet and a much improved NCAA team performance in March,” Salo said.

Who would’ve thought that the best resemblence to the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team of 2009 would be Miami University’s (or simply, “The U’s”) football team of 1987?
Jumping higher · Senior middle blocker Hunter Current and the USC men’s volleyball team will make their home debut tonight. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Off the court, these Trojans don’t resemble the arrogant, trash-talking, cocky players that personified the Miami stereotype of the ’80s and early ’90s. But on the court, the Trojans have learned a thing or two from that championship-winning team after watching the ESPN documentary, The U.
“One of the guys said that the other team wanted to win, but [Miami] knew how to win,” said sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who was named the AVCA National Player of the Week. “Last year, we wanted to win. But this year, we know how to win.”
During no time was that more evident than on Friday, when the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team — down two sets to love in a rematch of last year’s national championship (which they lost) against Irvine — gave a thrilling and gutty performance to win the last three sets and pull out the victory.
Tonight, they will get a chance to showcase that talent and No. 1 ranking for the first time in front of their home fans, as the Trojans (4-2, 2-0 MPSF) host Long Beach State (2-3, 1-1).
“We’re excited. Ever since I’ve been here we’ve gotten better each year,” junior outside hitter Murphy Troy said. “[It shows when our] home crowd gets more interested and brings more fans to the game. So finishing second last year, we’re really excited to create a lot of buzz for the team and the home crowd and do some great things for them.”
Yet, after the euphoric win at Irvine, the Trojans know they can’t overlook a talented Long Beach team that has struggled out of the gate. The 49ers have one All-American first teamer in Dean Bittner and an All-American second teamer in Dustin Watten who have the capability to cause the Trojans’ trouble from the service line and the net.
USC coach Bill Ferguson has been showing the team tapes of these players all week to get them motivated against a squad that finished .500 last year.
“They bring it from the service line and they are very physical at the net. If just watching those guys doesn’t alert us, something’s wrong. We’re gonna really need to be on it to take care of those guys,” Ferguson said.
That’s not to take anything away from the No. 1 team in the nation. The Trojans validated their ranking as the best team in the country Friday when it stormed back to defeat the defending national champions.
The comeback not only confirmed USC’s hold on the top spot, but gave the team the confidence to know it could beat anyone this year, even when it’s not playing its best.
The Trojans were out-hit (.325 to .235) and out-blocked (14-4) against Irvine, and they know they aren’t close to peaking yet. But they do know they can’t afford to come out slow against Long Beach, like they did against Irvine and in their only loss against Hawaii.
“We need to come out hard right from the very beginning. That first game we were not ready to play,” Ciarelli said. “That said, if you’re playing your best ball at the beginning of the season, most likely at the end of the season you’re not peaking. You need to work into it and progress. Everyone on this team wants to win, no doubt. But we know we’re not at our best yet.”
Yet even when they aren’t at their best, the Trojans are No. 1 in the country and beat the defending national champions. Who knows where they will be in a few months.

Before competing in their first dual match on Thursday, the USC women’s tennis team got in important tournament action last weekend.

While other team members were competing at the Freeman Memorial Championships in Las Vegas, sophomore Alison Ramos, freshman Danielle Lao and juniors Maria Sanchez and Lyndsay Kinstler participated in the National Collegiate Tennis Classic in Palm Springs, Calif.
To kick off their spring season, nationally ranked No. 8 Sanchez led the way for USC in her single’s play, making it all the way to the final round. At last year’s NCTC, Sanchez was the singles semifinalist and the No. 2 seed.
With a bye in the round of 16, Sanchez then defeated UCLA’s Andrea Remynse in a comeback three set match (4-6, 6-2, 6-0) to land a spot in the semifinal round. There she put away Stanford’s Lindsay Burdette (6-3, 6-3).
The sixth-seeded Alison Ramos of USC followed up a Round 16 three-set win by upsetting the No. 3 seed Maria Mosolova of Northwestern in the quarterfinals (6-0, 6-1). Later in the semifinals, Ramos fell to Stanford’s Hilary Barte.
This left Barte and Sanchez for the final round. In a tight first set, Barte took the singles title, defeating Sanchez 7-5, 6-2. Before taking the singles championship, Barte also ousted another Woman of Troy along the way. Barte took down freshmen Danielle Lao in the quarterfinals (6-3, 6-2). Kinstler lost early in the first round.
In the doubles scene, Ramos and Lao teamed up but were defeated in the semifinal round to UCLA’s Andrea Remynse and Yasmin Schnack (8-3). Kinstler and Sanchez were also ousted in the semifinal round to Stanford’s Barte and Mallory Burdette. Barte and Burdette later took home the doubles championship.
At the UNLV tournament, junior Cristala Andrews, a Las Vegas native, made it to the consolation finals. After Andrews lost in a tough first round (6-7, 4-6) to Florida’s Anastasia Revzina, she regained her momentum in the consolation rounds. In the final round of consolation play, Andrews lost in three sets to UNC’s Shinann Featherston (2-6, 6-0, 2-6). Both freshman Valeria Pulido and junior Leyla Entekhabi won one and lost two matches during their singles play.
In doubles, Andrews and Entekhabi were defeated early in the first round.
Overall, Sanchez believes it was a good weekend for her team. “It went well for being the first tournament back,” she said. “I think as we continue to play matches, we will get more and more in a grove and into the swing of things.”
The Women of Troy open their dual season on Thursday, hosting Long Beach State at 1:30 p.m.

The No. 1 USC men’s tennis team proved they are worthy of the high praise they received with a strong performance at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Westlake, Calif. this past weekend.
Double threat · Junior Jaak Poldma competed in both the singles and doubles events at the Sherwood Cup. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans excelled in the doubles bracket where the teams of senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson, senior Jason McNaughton and sophomore Daniel Nguyen and sophomore Matt Kecki and junior Jaak Poldma all qualified for the quarterfinals.
On top of that, the final featured two USC squads with Farah and Johnson beating out McNaughton and Nguyen 8-3.
The Trojans proved their competitive mettle in the all-USC final.
“It’s fun to play against USC, we’ve got a great team of competitors,” Farah said.
The team of Farah and Johnson was able to improve upon the previous year’s performance at Sherwood where they lost in the doubles finals.
The road to the finals did not go as anticipated before the tournament as freshmen J.T. Sundling was forced to sit out of the tournament on account of illness before it began.
To compensate for Sundling’s loss, McNaughton and Nguyen paired up and excelled against the competition. They faced the No. 1 ranked duo of sophomores Ryan Thacher/Bradley Klahn from Stanford in the semifinals and won 8-6 to advance to the finals.
In the singles bracket, top-seeded Johnson and Poldma advanced to the quarterfinals, and No. 1 seed Robert Farah qualified for the semifinals where he lost a tough match to eventual singles tournament champion Klahn in three sets 4-6, 7-5, 6-2.
Injuries were a big story line as the weekend progressed. Along with Sundling’s illness, Johnson had to pull out of the singles bracket after the quarterfinals because of an aggravated minor back injury during doubles play. Kecki was also not at his best during the tournament.
Peter Smith said the team is concerned with injuries as they start to get back in the swing of things
“We have to make sure we are healthy. We had some bumps and bruises coming back from break,” Smith said.
The injuries do not seem like they will affect the team long-term, Farah said, and, if they do, he feels that the team will be able to fill in the missing pieces.
“We have great players on the team. Another player will step in to take the spot of an injured teammate,” Farah said.
The squad proved its depth and adaptability in their strong performance in doubles, but Smith is still trying to find the right lineup for the long haul.
“I didn’t use the combinations that I wanted because of J.T.’s illness. I know we have good doubles players. I’m just trying to find the right combos,“ Smith said.
Although the team still has some questions to answer in doubles and left more to be desired in singles play, this weekend’s performance made a good impression on the Trojans as they await the official start of the season.
“Overall it was a good tournament for the majority of the team,“ Smith said.

Often, things collapse under the weight of expectations.
Cornerstone · After sinking a game-winning three last week against California, sophomore guard Ashley Corral keyed another big victory. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Movie sequels aren’t as funny or action-packed as their predecessors. Rookie NFL quarterbacks bust more often than not.
The game between the USC and UCLA women’s basketball teams received a lot of attention, and this time it lived up to the hype.
USC beat its crosstown rival 70-63 on Sunday in a tightly contested matchup that had the tenacity of an NCAA tournament game. More importantly, the win moved the Women of Troy (10-6, 4-1) ahead of UCLA (10-6, 3-2) and into third place in the conference, within striking distance of conference leader Stanford.
“Anything said and done in the Pac-10 obviously has to go through Stanford, but we’re going to have a lot to say about it,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
At USC’s forefront were sophomore guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath, who once again led their team to victory with their combination of individual ability and deft teamwork.
“[They] are the cornerstones to what we want to get done,” Cooper said. “We’re asking both of them to do a lot, but their shoulders are broad and they’ve been doing a great job.”
Corral scored a game-high 24 points on 7 of 12 shooting for USC, while Gilbreath added 19 points, six assists and five rebounds.
The Women of Troy struggled all game to get into its offensive sets against UCLA’s swarming defense, but time and again either Corral or Gilbreath broke down the defense and found the other for a wide-open shot.
“We’ve always had that thing where we know where [the other] is,” Corral said.
For much of the first half, it appeared the USC players had no idea where the three-point shooters were for the Bruins. UCLA rode hot shooting from beyond the arc and a powerful inside game to a one-point halftime lead.
USC, meanwhile, seemed content to hoist away perimeter jumpers. At one point, Cooper could be seen on the sidelines pretending to dribble a basketball, pleading with his players to attack the basket.
Despite a renewed emphasis on attacking the basket in the second half, USC still trailed the Bruins for much of the game until Gilbreath rebounded a missed free throw by Hailey Dunham and followed it with her own layup and free throw.
The four-point possession drew USC within three at 56-53 and gave the Women of Troy all of the momentum.
“It was just determination,” Gilbreath said. “Before that we had gotten into a huddle and said, ‘This is our time. If you’re going to do anything, do what you have to do to win.’”
Over the next minute, Corral knocked down a three-pointer and a pair of free throws to give USC a lead it would not relinquish. UCLA pulled to within one point twice, but clutch free throw shooting down the stretch by the Women of Troy helped USC hold on for a big win.
“We played all four of the top teams in the Pac-10 that were ranked, and we beat three of them,” Corral said. “I think that was huge for us going into the next big road trip.”
USC knocked down 24 of 27 free throws in the game. The Bruins connected on just 9 of 20 attempts.
Senior guard Erica Tukiainen led UCLA with 14 points. Senior guard/foward Aarika Hughes added 12 points for the Women of Troy.
USC travels north to take on the Washington schools in a pair of road games this week.
It is second place in the conference not third.

It sounds like a mad lib.
The upstart (adjective) USC men’s basketball team (typically inferior proper noun) walloped the miserable (depressing adjective) UCLA men’s basketball team (proper noun synonymous with Goliath) Saturday at Pauley Pavilion (above noun’s preferred location) by 21 (ridiculously large number) points.
Except this isn’t a mad lib. This is real. 
Yet, you wouldn’t know it.
Lost among the ogre amount of commotion and noise made by the USC football program last week was a landmark victory by the university scapegoats ­— the basketball team.
For a program that has been beaten to a pulp by the athletic department and national media for a scandal that the new coach and no current players were a part of, it’s only fair that the team gets some positive attention.
That moment came Saturday night, when the Trojans took down the basketball powerhouse across town that has won three out of the last four Pac-10 regular-season championships — at their palace. That’s not all: The 67-46 victory was the largest margin of victory for the USC basketball team over UCLA since Winston Churchill resigned as prime minister.
Any other year, this would be the front page story of the sports section of the Los Angeles Times and Daily Trojan.
This would get national attention as a monumental upset and tremendous, resume-boosting victory for the Trojans. There would be talk about USC’s RPI and a spot on the “bubble” during bracketology conversations. Heck, some people might be calling for them to be this year’s surprise Sweet 16 or Elite 8 team.
But this isn’t any other year. Two years after the departure of the player the entire athletic department bowed-down to, O.J. Mayo’s presence is still felt. Because of violations in his name, the school suspended the basketball team from any postseason play this year.
This means that any chance USC had of defending its Pac-10 tournament title, becoming this year’s “Cinderella team” and providing a memorable lasting experience for seniors who have more than earned it — senior guards Dwight Lewis and Mike Gerrity among them — is thrown out the window because of actions of which they had no part. In fact, the main characters in this sad story face no repercussions and are making millions in the NBA; see Tim Floyd and Mayo. For a team that was predicted to finish last in the Pac-10, it did not need to be kicked while it was down.
So, with no postseason to play for, there are two main goals for this team to aspire to: beat UCLA and win the Pac-10 regular-season championship. Even though UCLA is having a major down year, beating the Bruins is still considered a big feat in USC basketball — especially when that victory comes at Pauley Pavilion.
Which is why the Trojans’ victory over UCLA should have made more than a blip on the radar.
Except, out walked Pete Carroll, in walked Lane Kiffin, and all hell broke loose at Heritage Hall last week, keeping us from one of the best feel-good stories this year.
You don’t want to call the USC men’s basketball program a feel-good story? Sure, they committed some major sins in the past and are paying for them now. Sure they just beat a very mediocre, sub .500 team, which is hardly a cause for celebration.
These, however, are the reasons to invest in the basketball team. They didn’t just beat a .500 team, they beat UCLA in a defeat that didn’t sit well with the Westwood school’s head coach.
“I’m embarrassed for our team,” UCLA coach Ben Howland said after the game. “I feel embarrassed for the program, for the former players and coaches. That’s all you can say, it was embarrassing.”
If the Trojans could get a quote like this from every opposing head coach, that would be a victory in and of itself. To get it from UCLA’s head coach, that’s the ultimate compliment.
Also, with the postseason bans in place, the team has no postseason to play for and could easily have rolled over and quit on the team, their coach and each other. 
Only, they didn’t.
Even though their season ends March 6, they are playing with the heart and soul of a team fighting for a championship. Nobody would blame them if they lost the rest of their games. Some people might even expect that.
No, this team is playing for the chance to do something that has never been done in USC men’s basketball history — win a Pac-10 regular-season championship.
There was a groundbreaking victory for the USC men’s basketball team last Saturday, and there will be some inspiring basketball played at the Galen Center this week.
Too bad nobody is paying any attention.
“Spittin’ Sports” runs Wednesday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Kenny at klegan23@gmail.com.
“Too bad nobody is paying any attention.” No, I was! I read and saw it on the LA Times front page, ESPN college basketball and so forth. Good job men’s basketball! We don’t need OJ in either basketball or football to win.

If you were to tell the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (5-1, 2-0), before their Friday night match at the Bren Center, that they would trail UCI (4-2, 1-1), the defending national champions, by two sets on the last night of a grueling two-week road trip, only to come back and snatch the victory in thrilling fashion over the Anteaters, even the most confident of Trojan players would likely have chuckled at the idea.
Yet the Trojans stood in front of 2,648 fans at the end of their five-set victory, survivors in a match that had an atmosphere more fitting for an NCAA final than an early-season tussle in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference.
Daily Trojan | James Watson
A glance at the final score (19-30, 21-30, 30-17, 30-28, 15-12) would not fully explain how impressive the Trojans’ comeback was.
In a week that saw the team fly home on a tedious flight from Honolulu Sunday night, only to rebound on short rest three nights later with a triumphant victory over their crosstown rival, it appeared the No. 1 team in the country saved their best, or at least most riveting, performance for the finale.
It would not be an understatement to characterize USC’s first two sets Friday night as embarrassing, flat and completely unbefitting of a team that has been crowned as one of the elites across the country.
As UCI’s Jordan DuFault put the first set out of reach with seven straight points from the service line (19-30) however, it became apparent to all in attendance that only one team had initially shown up in a rematch of last year’s national championship.
“I don’t think we were ready to play right off the bat,” said sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli.
While the Trojans and Anteaters jostled for position in the second set, it was Carson Clark, a familiar foe who helped secure UCI’s victory in the fifth set of last year’s final, who gave the defending champs some much-needed breathing room. Clark, who had 22 kills, recorded seven straight points from the service line with the score knotted at 20. The Anteaters would score 10 of the set’s final 11 points en route to an easy 2-0 lead over USC.
Down 2-0 in enemy territory was not the situation coach Bill Ferguson believed his team would find themselves in, yet, as the team headed into the third set ,the Trojans’ play caller realized his team still had a chance.
Rather than shout or point blame at his players, Ferguson implored his team to improve their passing game and to execute when opportunities arose. While his speech between sets likely won’t make its way to Hollywood, his words allowed his players to relax and believe they still had a shot at a remarkable comeback.
Led by captain Murphy Troy’s eight service points, the Trojans climbed back into the match with an emphatic victory in the third set (30-17). In the set, USC not only relied on their floor general in Troy but came together as a unit, firing four aces and a hitting percentage of .455.
Daily Trojan | James Watson
While USC gained momentum heading into the fourth set, the Anteaters rallied back behind a tournament-like enthusiasm from their crowd and stellar play from setter Jeff Schmitz and DuFault and found themselves just four points from an early-season statement win. But the Trojans, in a match that according to their coach illustrated the team’s “resolve,” relied on back-to-back kills from Austin Zahn and Ciarelli, followed by a set point from Ciarelli, to tie the match in stunning fashion (30-28).
In the fifth set, it was the unsung contribution of junior setter Riley McKibben that put the finishing touches on the team’s turnaround. McKibben, who finished the night with 57 assists and a key kill down the stretch, kept the Anteaters guessing throughout the Trojans’ unlikely charge back from the embarrassment of their first two sets.
“I am absolutely stoked on our win for a variety of reasons,” McKibben said. “We exacted some revenge on our loss to them last year in the finals. And we showed that we could come back from a two-set deficit.”
As Austin Zahn capped the match with his final kill of the night (15-12), it became evident that this match was more than a comeback for the ages, a slaying of the former champion, or an opportunity to exact revenge on a bitter foe. It was a match that showed the will and fortitude of this year’s team, a match that truly was a testament to how special this group of players has become.
“The biggest thing we took away from this match was that we showed that our team has heart,” McKibben said. “As close as we were to defeat, we fought back and came up with a win.”

USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill certainly took advantage of his first career matchup against crosstown rival UCLA.
Strong move ·  Senior guard Dwight Lewis led a balanced USC attack and claimed a road victory at Pauley Pavilion on Saturday.  Lewis scored 24 points and shot better than 50 percent from behind the arc. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
O’Neill and the Trojans put on a record-breaking show Saturday, beating the Bruins 67-46 in the largest win ever for USC at Pauley Pavilion. Senior guard Dwight Lewis, who was 5 of 9 from the three-point line, led the team with 24 points while sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic added 19 points and six rebounds.
“Last week we didn’t play at our normal intensity, so I’m glad to see our guys have a great week of practice and play exceptionally well tonight,” said O’Neill. “We got off to a great start. We put ourselves in a position to win.”
The Trojans wasted no time in jumping to an early lead, as they started the first half with a 7-0 run punctuated by a Dwight Lewis three-pointer. The scoring continued from there as USC capitalized on numerous UCLA turnovers and converted them into scores, at one point widening their margin to 17 after just 14 minutes of play. Dwight Lewis had 17 of his 24 points in the first half, while the Bruins shot only 32 percent from the field and 11 percent from three-point range.
In the second half, Vucevic took charge for USC, scoring 17 of his 19 total . For the game he was on 7 for 10 shooting. He also added a long three-pointer that put the Trojans up by 24, a moment that proved to be the nail in the coffin for UCLA.
“We just gave it everything we had,” Vucevic said of their performance. “When I came [to Pauley Pavilion] for the warm-up, I felt ready to shoot today. I made the first [shot] and then the second, and that really helped my confidence.”
The Bruins continued to plague themselves with turnovers, committing five more in the second half, which brought their total to 12 for the game. They were also out-rebounded by the Trojans 37-22.
“In the beginning, coach said we wanted to jump on them early and try to impose our will,” said Lewis. “I felt like we did that, and it gave us a good chance to win the game.”
The win was USC’s second consecutive victory over the Bruins dating back to last season’s Pac-10 tournament semifinal match, although the Trojans had not won at Pauley Pavilion since the 2007-2008 season.
The 21-point margin of victory for the Trojans was also the largest against UCLA since the 1940s.
“I wasn’t aware of all the statistics or any of that stuff, but I’m glad I was a part of it,” O’Neill said. “I’m glad my team performed the way they did tonight, and I hope they perform that way the rest of the way. It’s just good to get a win like this in a big game against your rival.”
As Trojans, I’m glad we show class by not basking in immaturity over this victory over our rivals. Even UCLA, the school that loves to hate us, shows class by conceding to their loss and not making excuses. We know they got the upperhand in basketball, and that they’ll be back next season. But for now, victory is ours.

Last week, Haiti experienced a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in the capital city of Port-au-Prince, followed by incessantly large aftershocks. The prime minister of Haiti says more than 70,000 deaths have been recorded, with early estimates placing the death toll above 200,000 people.
To put that into perspective, the death toll from Hurricane Katrina was 1,836. 
In 2008, China’s Sichuan earthquake, which nearly leveled an entire province, killed about 70,000 people with more than 18,000 missing.
The Nargis Cyclone that destroyed much of Burma in 2008 wrought up to 138,000 deaths.
In each of these disasters, governments of the nations involved aided the areas, and governments from around the world offered relief money. With the earthquake in Haiti, the United States has pledged $100 million in aid along with 10,000 troops for a year. China and Europe have acted in a similar though more modest manner.
This government aid and emergency relief is necessary immediately following such a tragedy in order to be effective: The military brings organizational help for the distribution of food and water to those displaced by natural disaster and soldiers help bring order to the chaos and looting on the streets while emergency workers search for missing people. We often forget, however, about the other crucial and effective source of redevelopment — non-governmental organizations and faith-based organizations.
In addition to government aid, President Barack Obama commissioned former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to raise money for effective and appropriate aid to Haiti. Yet, in an interview on Fox News, both Bush and Clinton encouraged faith-based groups as “a very important part of not only this emergency but the long-term reconstruction of Haiti.”
In summer of 2008, just after China’s earthquake, I had the opportunity to spend almost two weeks aiding the recovery effort in Sichuan’s disaster zone. Every night, I watched the same clips of the Chinese government helping the destroyed areas, but I was most impressed by the substantial number of people that cared, especially the massive volunteer movement of Chinese students and underground Christian churches. These groups greatly impacted relief efforts by raising spirits and reaching reaching out to remote villages.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
One 2008 USC alumni, who has chosen to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of his involvement, spent many months directing relief efforts in Burma with a Christian organization. The group entered the country providing humanitarian aid prior to Cyclone Nargis.
Although Burma resisted all international aid and is infamous for its list of egregious human rights violations, the Burmese government gave complete freedom to the NGO and even provided financial resources since the group was so effective.
When it comes to natural disasters and catastrophes, governments are great at providing immediate relief, search and rescue and rebuilding infrastructure — all necessary aspects of recovery and moving forward. Groups are best, however, at helping others because of relational capacity and compassion.
In devastated areas like Haiti, we humans rise up compassionately to meet the challenge. Currently, money is flooding into relief organizations, and volunteer lists to travel there are filled with people who are eager to go to Haiti to help.
Even here at USC, the Keck School of Medicine sent a team of doctors to treat victims. Also, CrisisCamp, a student group on campus, is providing data, information, maps and technical assistance to NGOs to assist Haiti.
“People were fighting to survive before the earthquake struck. I can’t even imagine how desperate the situation is now,” said Jon Porter, a junior majoring in business administration, who worked in Haiti caring for local orphans during spring break last year.
We are very good at responding to catastrophe. But the real test of our compassion is in daily life — we need not travel far to find people we can serve.
If our compassion lasted beyond immediate need and devastation, life would very likely look much different, not only for our neighbors but for us as well.
It is equally important to provide relief at home as it is to places devastated by disaster. By living according to the Golden Rule that we learned in the third grade — treat others the way you want to be treated — together, we can improve life here in Los Angeles just as we are in places struck by disaster

Facilities available for special diets
Danielle Nismov’s article “Dining options fail to meet special dietary needs” (Jan. 13, 2010) prompts me to remind students there is a vegetarian meal plan option available at the USC Honors House Residence, located at 2710 Severance St.  The Honors House is the only USC residence hall in North University Park.  All other USC housing options are apartments.  Located on tram routes B and C, the Honors House includes a commissary, and housing contracts there come bundled with a ten meal (lunch and dinner) board plan.   Our chef, Brenda Jarmon, Assistant Manager of Everybody’s Kitchen, has been with the facility for more than 30 years.  She is a vegetarian in her own life, and she is a wonderful chef and an expert at vegetarian cuisine.  She prepares three entrees each evening:  meat, fish or seafood or poultry and vegan.

Athletic department needs transparency
 I write regarding USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s announcement to ban the USC men’s basketball team from postseason play this year, as well as additional penalities, such as the reduction in a scholarship for this season and next, as concerns the alleged improprieties surrounding O.J. Mayo during Mayo’s time at USC.  As a lifelong Trojan fan, a USC alumnus and a longtime USC men’s basketball season ticket holder, I am saddened and shocked by Garrett’s announcement.  I do not find sincerity in his words but rather a sense of hypocrisy.
USC has rarely showed any serious committment to the men’s basketball program.  The university’s on-campus arena, for example, was supposed to have been constructed decades ago.  Football has always been the school’s heart and soul and apparently will forever remain so.  Even the formulation of a new Song Girl squad follows the calendar year as opposed to the academic year so that the Song Girls may be in top synchronisity for the start of football season.
With penalities self-inflicted by the university on the men’s basketball program, Garrett has shown that once again nothing shall touch the sacred cash cow that is the football team.  Perhaps indeed there is a ring of truth to former coach Tim Floyd’s accussations of a lack of support from university officials during the investigation of O.J. Mayo’s Trojan tenure, an investigation, as I understand it, that was being performed in conjunction with the NCAA’s investigation of allegations of improprieties involving Reggie Bush and his family during his senior year.  If the athletic department was indeed committed to true self-regulation, then why no stripping of scholarships of the football team?  Or returning the Rose Bowl money earned during Bush’s senior season or giving back the university’s edition of Bush’s Heisman Trophy to the Downtown New York Athletic Club?  Likewise, if the current allegations against running back Joe McKnight are true, will the university return its Emerald Bowl money and erase the 2009 football season from the record books (an action I’m sure not too many alumni and fans would, in fact, mind)?
Rather than a committment to playing by the rules, as Garrett asserts, the athletic director’s actions appear to be more an attempt to demonstrate to the NCAA that USC’s athletic department does not lack “institutional control” when it comes to its programs, specifically the football program, which has been under investigation partly for just such a concern.  Thus, the men’s basketball team is the scapegoat to protect the sanctity that is USC football.
If USC truly is committed to excellence on the basketball court, as Garrett claims, then the USC ticket office should be directed to refund a percentage of the money we season ticket holders paid for what is now an absolutely pointless season.  Garrett ought likewise to demand that the ticket office lower its prices for men’s basketball season tickets for the 2010-11 season.

Last Tuesday, Google rocked cybersphere when it announced it would no longer be conforming to the “sanitized searches” endorsed by the Chinese government on
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Google.cn. China’s long history of media censorship was extended to search engines when Google made its multimillion dollar deal with the country’s dictatorship back in 2005.
In what many are now calling the web’s Berlin Wall moment, Google decided to rise up against Chinese censorship law in response to a hacking incident, which the search engine conglomerate has suggested was sponsored by the Chinese government. Competitive Internet giant Yahoo also stepped forward, using decidedly politicized language when it stated that it would be “aligned” with Google on the issue of Internet privacy. Even the U.S. Department of State decided to get involved, issuing a statement last Friday saying that it would demand a formal explanation from the Chinese government.
It is unclear at what point Google security became an issue of national importance — perhaps even national security — but what is certain is that this issue extends far beyond the rights of the everyday Chinese Internet user.
For Google, this was probably more of a scare tactic attempting to show the Chinese government who’s boss than an actual threat to close Google’s China enterprise; despite the very public fallout, Google only dropped its censorship controls on Google.cn for a number of hours. And, despite the high-and-mighty claim that Google would no longer collaborate with political oppressors, the company has returned to business as usual for the time being.
Google’s moral posturing seems somewhat questionable for several reasons. For one thing, if they really cared so much about so-called political oppression, then why did they agree to impose censorship models when they signed their initial contract? Some argue that Google’s CEOs were actually very worried about that issue from the beginning, yet felt that it would be better to provide some access to external world views than none at all. No doubt the thought of accessing more than a billion new potential users was also a strong incentive.
Furthermore, Google’s decision to take a strong stance probably has a lot more to do with protecting its assets (and its image) than the company’s political values. If the Chinese government was able to access Google’s highly lucrative intellectual property, the company could potentially face billions of dollars in losses. Equally important, if Google’s business clients fear that switching to Google Apps will compromise their security, it will be very hard to lure those important investors back out from behind their secure corporate servers.
Since the Chinese Communist Party conducted a business transaction with Google, this case creates several interesting questions from a political perspective. Google was essentially able to break Chinese law, without incurring any political consequences — because from Google’s perspective, the issue wasn’t Chinese law, but the terms of the Google.cn contract. China hacked first, so Google simply retaliated; the worst China can do is break its contract with Google.
This raises the second interesting point: If Google is able to break Chinese law without consequences, then does that make the company more powerful than the country? Probably not, but no doubt the Chinese government is livid that Google was able to take such swift and damaging action, not because of the company’s net power, but because of its technological superiority.
The political element only really came in when the U.S. Department of State decided to get involved. It’s possible that the State Department was simply using the Google issue to remind China that America still disapproves of Chinese political ideology. But the other, scarier possibility is that the State Department is actually worried that national security could be compromised via Chinese hackers on Google servers.
Technology has gone a long way toward meshing all areas of modern life in a way that’s never been seen before. But for businesses, business will always come first, and governments will always dwell mainly in politics. Though the two worlds have been brought into close collision, their interests are essentially aligned: As long as Google can make a profit off China, and China can modernize its country through Google, the two will continue to interact.
Either way, one thing is certain: China will now be more nervous than ever to tap into those technological assets, in whatever way they can.

For the record, I would like to formally apologize to Percy ‘Lil’ Romeo’ Miller and those who read my last article entitled “It’s a wrap for Romeo.”
Much to my chagrin and that of countless other reports made from reputable websites like ESPNLosAngeles.com and AllHipHop.com, which claimed the sophomore point guard was no longer a member of USC Basketball, it appears the rap artist/student athlete is still a presence on the team.
According to a Monday blog posted on LATimes.com, Miller insists that he has not been kicked off the team, despite the proverbial coffin that reporters such as myself had previously dug for him over the past few days.
It seems that Miller is currently out for an AC joint sprain in his left shoulder and his absence from practice, road games, and other functions have solely been a result of his injury.
“Not my statement at all,” Miller told The Times in regard to the statement released on AllHipHop.com. “If it wasn’t for my injury, I’d be out there practicing and playing. I love this team. I won’t quit this team. These are like my brothers.”
The highly publicized third-string point guard also assured his fans and concerned student admirers that he has only done one interview since the season began and that his MySpace.com page is the place to get the most accurate information regarding his day-to-day activities.
Miller, who has scored as many points this season as articles written about him on our website (2), also refuted the statement regarding an upcoming album set to hit stores on Aug. 10.
So again, to those who were forced to trudge through my last article on the departure of a Trojan great, my apologies on a poor job of reporting.
But as Romeo said in one of his famous songs from 2001, in the end “we can make it right.”
“For the record, I would like to formally apologize to Percy ‘Lil’ Romeo’ Miller and those who read my last article entitled ‘It’s a wrap for Romeo.'”
Don’t worry.  I don’t think that’s too many.
Do you recommend your own articles, Dave? Seems to me every one you write gets recommended.

NFL rookies are usually allotted time to develop into the playmakers that they are hopeful to become but some have the unique ability to impact the game immediately.  On Thursday, Sporting News announced its 2009 NFL All-Rookie Team, recognizing the players who have done just that.
The Trojans are well represented with quarterback Mark Sanchez of the New York Jets, linebacker Brian Cushing of the Houston Texans and linebacker Clay Matthews of the Green Bay Packers making the list.
Although Sanchez disappointed fans by declaring early for the NFL draft after leading the Trojans to a victory in the Rose Bowl, he has recently proven that he can play in the NFL.  Despite a mediocre 9-7 season with 20 interceptions, only 10 touchdowns, and a quarterback rating of 63.0, Sanchez and the Jets will play in the AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts after overcoming their underdog status to beat the Cincinnati Bengals and the San Diego Chargers.
Few are surprised that Cushing has been so successful.  He finished his college career with 178 tackles, 8.5 quarterback sacks and was named to the All-American first team by Sports Illustrated.  As a rookie, Cushing had 133 tackles and 4 sacks. He was named to the Pro Bowl and the 2009 Associated Press NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.
Even though Matthews came to USC as a walk-on in 2004 and did not start until his senior season with the Trojans, he had 51 tackles and 10 sacks in his first season with the Packers.  Matthews’ 10 sacks led the team, and are the most by a Packers’ rookie in franchise history. Matthews will also be joining Cushing in the Pro Bowl as he replaced Lance Briggs from the Chicago Bears due to injury.

There have been a lot of good films this past year, from the critically lauded (The Hurt Locker), to the summer blockbusters (Star Trek). But then there were also films you didn’t see. And since the DVDs are out, here’s a list of films for your next trip to Netflix or Blockbuster.
Endgame
South Africa has been the topic of some big name films, from Clint Eastwood’s Invictus to the sci-fi hit District 9, but Pete Travis’ historical thriller on the end of Apartheid emerged as the most engaging and intense one of them all. Never feeling predictable, Endgame is a film rife with tense standoffs, sudden violence and people working to overcome fear and mistrust. The cast is particularly brilliant, with Chiwetel Ejiofor’s turn as the burdened Thabo Umbeki being the highlight.
Five Minutes of Heaven
Like Endgame, reconciliation played a role in Oliver Hirschbiegel’s look into the aftermath of the Troubles of Northern Ireland. Years after he murdered an IRA member in cold blood, the reformed killer Alistair Little (Liam Neeson) goes to meet his victim’s brother (James Nesbitt). Taking its back story from true events, Five Minutes of Heaven is a powerful, moving film, with Neeson and Nesbitt giving powerful performances that drive the movie.
State of Play
Based off a hit BBC miniseries, State of Play was certainly one of the smartest films of the year. When a congressman’s (Ben Affleck) aide is murdered and revealed to be his mistress, he turns to his journalist friend (Russell Crowe) for help in surviving the media backlash and figuring out what happened. Full of twist and turns, the film not only serves as a powerful critique on the state of today’s media, but is also a complex, intelligent thriller with great leads. Fans of the Bourne trilogy or the classic All the President’s Men should definitely check this one out.
Push
If State of Play was smart, Push was genius. Featuring unique concepts and interesting twists, Push was probably the most underrated film of the year. In a world where psychic powers are real and those who have them are hunted by the world’s governments, fugitives in Hong Kong end up being hunted by both government operatives and local gangs. The film gave strict rules to the psychic powers, both deconstructing them and grounding the film. The cast, while not A-list stars, shines, especially Chris Evans, Cliff Curtis and Djimon Hounsou. While not an all out action film, fights in Push are some of the most original of the entire year, featuring glass-shattering screams and telekinetic gunfights.
It Might Get Loud
This is a must see for fans of rock and roll. Davis Guggenheim, the director of the environmental documentary An Inconvenient Truth, moves to a more engaging topic, bringing together Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White to discuss their affinity for the electric guitar. Part biography, part discussion and part concert, It Might Get Loud is a tribute to the staple instrument of rock and roll and three greats of the genre. Plus, the scenes where the trio plays together are amazing and a must see.
Dead Snow
Nazi zombies, that is all. This Norwegian action-comedy is a wonderful mix of twisted humor, over the top violence and great direction from Tommy Wirkola, who summed up the film’s origin as “We thought ‘what’s more evil than zombies? Nazi zombies!’” Featuring excellent production values, an excessive amount of fake blood and a cast who really seem to be enjoying the film, Dead Snow is quite simply a comedic masterpiece.
