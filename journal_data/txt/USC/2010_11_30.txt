The Emergency Medical Services of USC will provide a course this spring for students to become certified emergency medical technicians.
Although the class cannot be taken for USC credit, the classes will be offered on campus and will equip students with the skills required to handle medical emergencies.
“It’s a great way to get clinical experience,” said EMSC Chief Daniel Furlong, a senior majoring in neuroscience.
Founded in 2009, EMSC is an entirely student-run organization that collaborates with USC Fire Safety, Department of Public Safety and the University Park Health Center.
After taking the training course, students can apply to join the EMSC staff and volunteer as EMTs at events such as tailgates and sporting events. In the spring, EMSC members also assist in the supervision of intramural games.
So far, EMSC members have staffed multiple USC events, including the Oct. 22 Democratic rally on campus where President Barack Obama spoke, Furlong said.
“There were 37,000 people on campus, so we were USC’s first responders,” Furlong said.
The class trains students on a variety of medical emergencies, from cardiovascular emergencies to seizures, he said.
“We’ve seen diabetic emergencies, we’ve seen broken wrists and broken ankles. We’ve seen [cases of fainting], seizures and chest pains,” Furlong said. “We’ve seen a bunch of different medical emergencies so we’re pretty well-versed.”
Although EMSC is relatively young, Furlong has high hopes for the future of the program.
“Our goal is to eventually be … a 24/7, 911 emergency responder for USC. UCLA does that and hopefully one day we can be like them where we can actually be a paid EMS provider for USC,” he said.
As trained EMTs, medical students can get valuable work experience that could help when applying to medical school, Furlong said.
Tanya Shah, a sophomore majoring in psychology on the pre-med track, said the class is also great for students who aren’t pursuing a career in the medical field, because the skills learned can be applied to everyday life.
“Even if I wasn’t pre-med, I think that the class is really important,” she said. “I think the life skills are huge.”
EMSC Deputy Chief Catherine Khoo, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said she believes the class provides experience and knowledge in stressful situations.
“The EMT training is a lot of really pertinent information for pre-meds and just anyone really. It’s information that’s really good to know,” Khoo said. “It kind of gets people thinking in stressful situations. It prepares you for really pressurized situations.”
The class is put on through the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care and students participate in “ride-along” training, where they complete a shift on an ambulance as part of certification.
“We really all loved [the class] … It was a really close-knit group. The way they structured it was a lot of fun,” Shah said. “It wasn’t like an obligation to get up in the morning and go to class.”
Khoo also said she found the class worthwhile.
“It’s a lot more interactive than your normal classes … You don’t have to have a lot of [biology] knowledge beforehand,” she said. “It’s really kind of just recognizing something and learning how to treat it, or doing the most that you can in that short period of time that you’re given.”

Rachel Kim, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism who was known for her compassion and striking sense of humor, died on Nov. 24 after she was found unresponsive in her dorm room. She was 18.
Friends and family said Kim could always cheer someone up and would not hesitate to give anything to anyone who needed help or seemed down.
Big heart · Rachel Kim’s father, Bob Kim (left), said she spent much of her childhood reading, playing music and participating in sports. Friends say Kim was close with her mom, Leslie (right) and family. - Photo courtesy of Molly Keam 
“She was a unique personality, she wasn’t afraid to be herself, she didn’t necessarily have to conform to everybody’s expectations,” said Bob Kim, Rachel’s father. “I knew she was independent.”
Kim grew up in Brookeville, Md. with her parents, Bob and Leslie Kim, and older brother Michael Kim.
She spent much of her childhood reading, playing music and participating in sports, her father said. She also enjoyed meeting new people and loved to travel.
Kim served as a content editor of her high school newspaper, which led to her interest in journalism at USC.
“She would have been a great writer — she was a free spirit about things. She could have written some books,” her father said.
Kim said he remembers his daughter as fiercely independent but loyal to her friends and family. She was a voracious reader, and would finish two to three books each week.
One of her favorite authors was Chuck Palahniuk, who wrote Fight Club and Choke, Bob Kim said.
“She found out the movie Choke was debuting at the Sundance film festival,” he said. “I remember her making me get up at four o’clock in the morning to get tickets to see the movie, and she actually had the book with her.”
Dylan Aldrich, a freshman majoring in international relations who went to middle school with Kim, said she was extremely outgoing and creative.
“Sometimes, I’d go into her room and we’d just take funny pictures on her Mac,” Aldrich said. “She would laugh every time I was with her.”
Aldrich said he admired Kim for her colorful personality and confidence to always be herself.
“A lesson I’ve taken from her is to just really be unabashedly yourself,” he said. “It’s really important to not pose or try to do things that you think are going to please everybody else.”
Molly Keam, Kim’s roommate, said Kim considered changing her major from print and digital journalism to psychology because of the changing nature of the media industry.
“She really enjoyed reading, but not so much fiction — books that actually have something to say about life. She was really into the mind,” Keam said.
But what friends said they remembered most was Kim’s pervasive compassion and concern for other people.
“If she could tell we were going through a tough time, she would drop everything and go spend time with them,” Keam said. “I remember one of the girls on the floor really needed an inhaler, and [Kim] was just so worried about that for the rest of the night. She was always so concerned with everyone else’s well-being.”
Kim had a quirky sense of humor and was fun to be around, said Sydney Goldman, a freshman majoring in communication.
“She was just always a lot of fun. She knew exactly what to say to crack everyone up, but be totally dead-pan about it. She was always very unique and very different than everyone else,” Goldman said. “To know her is to love her.”
Andrew Mellen, a junior majoring in business administration, said he instantly clicked with Kim when they met.
“I don’t know how we connected. We just started talking at four in the morning and that was it,” Mellen said. “I’ve met hundreds and hundreds of people at USC, maybe thousands, and not many have I instantly befriended like that and it just says something.”
Kim loved all types of music, a characteristic that Mellen said demonstrated her open-minded personality.
“I’ve never met one person who looked at her negatively, because she was just so — she didn’t judge,” Mellen said. “She just took people how they were and she just thought people should do the same. She was just very thoughtful of others … She’s a sweetheart.”
Students often saw Kim walking around campus with Beats by Dr. Dre headphones, Peter Wyche, a sophomore majoring in mathematics and philosophy, wrote in an e-mail. Kim loved dubstep music and pandas, he wrote, but more importantly, Wyche said Kim changed his life and helped him turn it around.
“She always put smiles on the faces of those around her, whether through her actions or by goofy faces she would make to cheer us up,” Wyche wrote. “We always wished we could return the favor … Rae meant the world and more to me.”
A candlelight vigil will be held tonight at 9 p.m. in Argue Plaza, located next to the Alumni House, and students who would like to write a message can sign a poster in memory of Kim in Pardee Tower.
A memorial service for Kim will also be held in Maryland on Saturday.

Faisal Alam, a gay Muslim activist, spoke at USC on Tuesday night about bridging the various stereotypes of Islam with followers who are progressive or gay.
Breaking out · Activist Faisal Alam struggled growing us a gay Muslim, and went on to found a support organization for LGBT Muslims. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
The Queer and Ally Student Assembly hosted Alam in Doheny Library in an effort to provide a different perspective to the LGBT and Muslim community.
“There is a notion that Islam is out to take over the world — that we will bring Islamic fundamentality to the U.S. … and so there is this association with that in the U.S. today,” Alam said.
QuASA Executive Director Emily Allen said the organization wanted to host an event that incorporated a wide variety of people — in this case, the Muslim and LGBT communities.
“This event caters to the Islamic community and other people who want to know more about this section of the queer community,” Allen said.
Alam spoke to a full crowd in the Intellectual Commons about a side of Islam that many Muslims and Americans might not be familiar with.
“Islam is a very diverse and dynamic faith. There are more than 1.5 billion Muslims in the world and 56 countries with Muslim majorities,” Alam said.
Alam said he struggled with coming out as a gay Muslim growing up in a small town in Connecticut, and that when he was growing up, he was taught that a gay Muslim cannot and should not exist.
“This notion that [being a gay Muslim] was not acceptable or that it didn’t exist obviously caused me a lot of pain, because by the time I got to high school, when I realized that I was gay, I was faced with this question of: How can I be gay if I’m Muslim, if God doesn’t make someone like that and if it’s not acceptable?” Alam said.
Alam said that because he was so heavily involved in a Muslim community growing up, he wanted to get involved in the global Muslim gay community. For this reason, he started an e-mail listserv for gay Muslims.
“Within minutes, people started to join, because that’s how much silence there is among people in our community about this issue. But for six months, not one person out of the 50 people who had joined wrote a message,” Alam said.
He launched the organization Al Fatiha in 1998 to address the issues of LGBT Muslims and provide support in reconciling their faith and their sexual orientation.
“The world is really not black or white — regardless of what Osama Bin Laden, George Bush or Barack Obama want us to believe,” Alam said. “I believe there is great diversity in the world and a lot of complexity in the world.  And a lot of times we are looking for quick answers and we don’t want to look at the history of the world we live in.”

The USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center is currently conducting a search for a new director after Peter Jones, director of the Cancer Center for 17 years, announced that he will be stepping down from his position in order to focus on his research.
Jones, who has been at USC since 1977, will continue to conduct research in the field of epigenetics in the labs of the Cancer Center, but he will be forgoing the administrative duties of director — which include fundraising and recruiting top faculty ­— to spend more time working in what he said is an important field of study.
“The field of epigenetics has been around for 30 years, but it’s suddenly reached national and international prominence,” Jones said. “It’s very exciting. The field is really just starting to take off big time.”
Jones has been at the forefront of many developments in epigenetics, including the study of the changes and switching of genes without altering the fundamental genetic information. He said he will continue to focus on work that he hopes will lead to new and effective manners of detecting and treating cancer.
“We’re interested in whole epigenomes and understanding how all the bits and pieces that are involved in the packaging genes in the nucleus of the human cell work together, and how those processes go wrong in the formation of diseases such as cancer,” Jones said. “It opens up avenues for cancer detection, treatment and things like that.”
Throughout Jones’ tenure as director, USC Norris has developed a focus on epigenetics and has become a leader in the field.
“We have one of the most outstanding groups of people working in epigenetics here,” Jones said. “It’s something that we have a real international exposure to, and the Cancer Center has played a leading role.”
Jonathan Samet, chairman of the department of preventive medicine and the head of the search committee for the Cancer Center’s next director, praised Jones for his contributions to maintaining USC Norris as a top comprehensive cancer center.
“[Cancer centers] give you an identity, both in research and patient care, and under Dr. Jones’ leadership the Cancer Center has maintained its prominence, science has grown and there’s been a continued emphasis on bringing great scientists here,” Samet said.
Jones said much of his success is because of the excellence and assistance of the university throughout his career. Soon after his start at USC, he gained recognition for his work, receiving the Associates Award for Creativity in Research and Scholarship in 1983.
“Recognizing my research at an early stage was very helpful and supportive in the sense that they acknowledged the importance of good research,” Jones said. “They’ve really allowed me to prosper by giving me a lot of freedom to do the kind of research I wanted to do.”
Jones oversaw several developments at USC Norris during his time as director, including the expansion of the Topping Tower in 1996 and the construction of the Harlyne J. Norris Research Tower in 2007, which gave the Cancer Center a 172,000-square-foot building dedicated solely to cancer research.
Samet said that there is no definite timetable to find the new director, although he said he hopes the next director will be named within six months. He said replacing someone like Jones will require an exhaustive search, but the prestigious position should draw top candidates.
“We’re looking for a national leader, someone who can come here and continue the development of the Cancer Center,” Samet said. “We want somebody who has a proven competency, is a great leader, all those things … Our committee’s job in some ways has been made easier by Dr. Jones because we have such a great Cancer Center.”

Senior quarterback Mitch Mustain took most of the first-team reps at practice on Tuesday, but it was the player who stood on the sidelines most of the time that garnered the most attention.
Fighting back · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley injured his ankle against Oregon State, but says he will be ready to face UCLA. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
As USC prepares to play its last game of the season against UCLA on Saturday, all eyes are on sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley.
More specifically, his left ankle.
Barkley was in uniform and limited in practice Tuesday. He is battling a high-ankle sprain he suffered before halftime in the Oregon State game two weeks ago and didn’t play at all against Notre Dame.
After USC’s loss to the Fighting Irish, however, Barkley said there was no doubt he would play this week and remained equally optimistic on Tuesday.
“That’s the mindset you got to have,” Barkley said. “I think it’s a little more probable [playing] this week but I’m definitely anticipating being back in.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin said Barkley threw the ball well in his limited snaps on Tuesday but needs to show that he can move around unhindered by his ankle for him to start Saturday.
“I hope he’s going to play, I think he’s going to play, but I don’t know for sure if he’s going to play,” Kiffin said. “We’re going to go throughout the week and it’ll probably be a gametime decision.”
Barkley wore a thin brace on his left ankle on Tuesday, but said it doesn’t inhibit him at all and only prevents the movement that injured his ankle. He said his ligaments are healed for the most part.
“Pain scale is the only thing I’m dealing with right now,” Barkley said. “The injury itself is pretty healed up, pretty quick, which I’m happy about. All the rehab I’ve been doing paid off. So it’s just really a bone bruise which I’m trying to get rid of and ease the pain off that. It’s hard in practice to get your mind off it when that’s the only thing you’re dealing with, but in a game when your adrenaline is pumping through your veins you don’t really think about it.”
Barkley has started at quarterback every game this year except last week and hopes he can finish the way he started.
“This is my team. I feel like I need to be out there with those guys,” Barkley said. “But at the same time, if I’m not going to be ready for the job Mitch can definitely handle it.”
—
Walk-on sophomore Tony Burnett received most of the first-team reps at safety Tuesday. Starting sophomore safety T.J. McDonald was not in uniform and had a sling over his right shoulder which he separated against Notre Dame, and fellow starting sophomore Jawanza Starling was limited with an injury that kept him out of the last game.
Burnett came in for McDonald last game and Kiffin said he was impressed with his play.
“For a guy who really hasn’t played that much football for a long time, just really played on special teams for the most part this year, he did well,” Kiffin said.
Conditioning seems to be more of a problem than who plays QB– USC has lost the 4th quarter of almost every game and now the basketball team seems to be suffering the same problem

The murmurs I’m hearing through the grapevine signal a sense of uneasiness in Southern California, as the calendar changes to 2011 in just more than a month.
To put it mildly, the last 330 days around this neck of the woods haven’t exactly been hallmark material for the USC football program.
Coaching departures, NCAA-imposed sanctions, a student-turned-player-agent roaming aimlessly around campus in a golf cart and a sub-par football season later, and it seems as if the metaphorical ball was dropped long before Saturday night’s 20-16 conclusion.
But for every misstep, blown coverage and deer-in-the-headlights moment that has come the Cardinal and Gold’s way this year, there exist hidden stories beneath the aging peristyles of the Coliseum that shine a much different perspective on what looks to be a bleak and rather unmemorable season.
During last Saturday’s game between USC and Notre Dame, one of these stories — lost between a game-winning touchdown that wasn’t and a torrential downpour — unfolded about 75 cement stairs up from the muddied white lines of the playing field, where 14-year-old Carlos Moran was taking in his first USC game in Section 115, Row 64, Seat 1.
Don’t be fooled by his age because, unlike most teenagers, Carlos is of a rare mold. He’s engaging, mature beyond his years, genuine to a T, and possesses the uncommon ability to charm anybody within the first few seconds of a conversation.
You’d never know it from the uplifting tone in his voice or the amazing knack he has for finding strength in just about any situation, but Carlos’ year has been anything but a swift high step to the end zone.
His 2010 season was not defined by late-game miscues or underwhelming performances, but rather by visits in and out of hospitals, an unpleasant trip to the surgery table and more or less a period of confinement by way of life’s unpredictable nature.
After undergoing surgery earlier this year to, as he puts it bluntly, “remove bags of pus inside of him”, the 14-year-old did what he knew best: stayed patient.
Instead of moping around the LAC+USC Medical Center during the weeks following his surgery, Carlos befriended and bonded with the pediatric team — made up of hospital staff, doctors and students from the USC School of Pharmacy and Keck School of Medicine — who were assigned to look after him.
“I really liked the hospital; everyone was really nice,” Carlos said. “Usually at other hospitals the people that work there don’t have enough time. But for me, they took the time to check in on me, and I really like that.”
Although he might have been treated to first-class customer service during his stay, the biggest reward for his patience and unwavering spirit came on Oct. 18, when he received some friendly encouragement from an unlikely source: the USC football team.
Both confronted with troublesome circumstances and both looking to each other for a much-needed boost of support, it was no surprise that the visit quickly turned into love at first sight between a kid and his local football team.
“For me it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” Carlos said. “There are a lot of people that want to see the USC players, and I got to see them.”
It’s customary upon departure for the team to leave the patients with tickets to an upcoming game — an opportunity Carlos embraced with open arms.
But days before he and his family were set to watch the Trojans in person, a nagging pain in his leg sent Carlos back to the confines of the all-too-familiar medical center — a bump in the road he didn’t take lightly.
His trip to the Coliseum was cancelled, and as all of the other patients excitedly headed toward the USC campus to watch their favorite gridiron stars in person, the 14-year-old was left with the lingering question: When will my day come?
That answer came by way of Phi Delta Chi, USC’s professional pharmacy fraternity, and the helping hand of Lindsey Tsugawa, a graduate student studying pharmacy.
Tsugawa currently works under the direction of Dr. Irving Steinberg, who just so happens to be a member of the pediatric team that cares for Carlos.
Every year around the holidays, the fraternity devotes time to philanthropic activity aimed toward promoting the social, scholastic and professional growth of its members. Whether it’s with their work with the St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital or the resources the group delivered to local Los Angeles schools last year, no stone goes unturned in the Phi Delta Chi quest for community outreach.
This year with money earned from several fundraising events on the Heath Sciences Campus, the fraternity’s president Derek Garcia did what any forward-thinking medical student would do — he acted with his heart.
Not only did Phi Delta Chi raise enough money for Carlos to see the Trojans play Notre Dame, but the fraternity provided him with two extra tickets — giving him the opportunity to not only experience the game with his father and a friend, but also teach them some of the finer points along the way.
“In general at the hospital, and especially in pediatrics, we try to divert a patient’s attention to something more positive, so they are not focused on how they are ill,” Tsugawa said. “For him, I could tell he really loved football and having the football players there to help impact his life was huge for him. So to have the opportunity for him to see these players play, and do what they do, was just amazing.”
Fittingly enough, the night unfolded with a bevy of follies and forgettable highlights, including the dropped pass by Carlos’ favorite player, senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, who Carlos said was the most positive man he met. Combine the turnover-filled sloppy mess of a game with torrential rain, and on the surface you’d expect Carlos’ first visit to USC’s grand cathedral to be his last.
But for a kid who has been forced to grow up faster than most, it’s no surprise the unwelcoming weather and final outcome were not enough to deter Carlos from enjoying a night that almost never happened.
“It was emotional. I don’t care if they lost or if they won,” Carlos said. “At least they played, and I got to be there to see it. It was the best — just a great experience for me.”
So how does a teen’s first football experience play into how we evaluate USC’s turbulent roller coaster ride in 2010?
To start, take Carlos’ advice: “Patience is everything.”
Sure, the Trojans’ newest No. 1 fan can’t help senior quarterback Mitch Mustain on his timing routes, or teach the wide receiving corps Pass-Catching 101. But his unexpected yearlong challenge might be more telling than your standard X’s and O’s revision.
Forced to overcome real obstacles, Carlos simply stayed the course. He accepted the process, opened up to the people around him and replaced fear and uncertainty with positivity and trust.
So the lesson for supporters of the USC football program to learn in the coming year is simple: Do what Carlos Moran has done — face the barriers that lie ahead with an appreciation toward the struggle, even if when all is said and done the journey doesn’t end with new hardware in Heritage Hall.

New Senior Associate Athletic Director John K. McKay was out of sports and practicing law at Jeffer Mangels Butler & Marmaro LLP in August when he received an unexpected phone call.

It was McKay’s former teammate and current friend Pat Haden, who told McKay that he had decided to take the newly vacant athletic director’s spot at their alma mater, USC.
“You’re kidding,” McKay said.
Haden wasn’t kidding, and he wanted McKay to join him as his right-hand man in a reunion of one of USC’s most famous quarterback-receiver combos.
“It literally took me 30 seconds to decide,” McKay said. “That’s how long it took for me to quit my law practice.”
Perhaps he should have taken a little bit longer.
“I called my wife and said, ‘We’re going back to USC with Pat,’” McKay said. “She said, ‘Great! How much money are you going to make?’”
McKay laughed.
“I forgot to ask how much money I would make,” he said. “I really did take the job without knowing anything about the money. It really didn’t have anything to do with the money for me, and I know with Pat it didn’t either.”
A love of football and sports in general has always held a strong influence in McKay’s life as he grew up in the midst of one of USC’s greatest runs as a college football program. His father, John Harvey McKay, spent 16 seasons as head coach of the Trojans, winning four national titles in the process.
“It was a great way to grow up,” McKay said. “My whole childhood was wandering around this campus, going to the Coliseum and going to football practice. It was a lot of fun.”
McKay quickly developed into a highly prized recruit at wide receiver out of Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, Calif., alongside close friend and Bishop quarterback Haden. Both received scholarship offers from several schools, including one of the Trojans’ oldest rivals in Notre Dame, before mutually deciding to play for McKay’s father and attend USC.
“The only school we really would have gone to other than USC would have been Notre Dame,” McKay said with a smile. “We were both Irish-Catholic kids and we really liked Notre Dame. But we decided that staying here and going to USC was the right thing to do.”
That decision would impact both men’s lives in exponential ways. Haden and McKay became the key cogs in a Trojan squad that won national championships in 1972 and 1974.
The latter was an especially memorable year. In the second-to-last game of the year, USC overcame a 24-0 deficit to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, scoring 55 unanswered points to beat the defending national champions.
“That’s a game that today, wherever I go, people still talk about it,” McKay said.
The next week, USC beat Ohio State in the Rose Bowl, 18-17, largely thanks to McKay’s 38-yard touchdown reception from Haden with just more than two minutes to play. The two were named the game’s co-MVPs. After the game, Haden and McKay went to a party and watched the Notre Dame-Alabama game on television. Alabama defeated the Fighting Irish, which gave the Trojans the national championship.
“That’s the memory that sticks out far and away,” McKay said. “It was incredible.”
The 1974 Rose Bowl was the last moment of glory on the gridiron for McKay. Drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the 16th round of the 1975 NFL Draft, he had, by his own admission, a “short and unremarkable” career at the professional level. McKay never saw the field with the Browns and ended up playing for his father again, this time with the woeful Tampa Bay Buccaneers. By 1978, McKay was out of football and looking to a career in law.
“I’ve practiced law basically since 1985,” McKay said. “But I’ve taken a couple breaks from it. I’ve constantly been trying to get back into football and sports.”
McKay tried several football-related endeavors over the next several years. In the mid 1990s, he worked with the current chairman of USC’s Board of Trustees Edward Roski in an attempt to acquire an NFL franchise and move it to Los Angeles. After the idea never materialized, McKay went back to law for a few years before the WWE’s Vince McMahon came calling. McMahon had forged a partnership with NBC and created the XFL, a wrestling-football hybrid, and he wanted McKay to run a franchise.
“I left my law practice for a year to run the Los Angeles Xtreme,” McKay said. “We won the championship, which was great, but the league folded after a year.”
So McKay returned to law once again, remaining there until Haden’s call four months ago. Yet even through all the misfires, McKay said he always knew where he would end up.
“I grew up with a love for ’SC,” McKay said. “It was always in the back of my mind that I would do something associated with this place. The opportunity came out of the blue a little bit.”
McKay also said he wasn’t surprised that Haden called on him to help lead the athletic program.
“We’ve literally been best friends since 1967,” McKay said. “I’ve never done anything important in my life that I didn’t check with him on. It almost goes without saying that if he was going to do something like this, he would want me to come along.”
McKay realized the challenges that awaited him when he arrived at USC, and none was more pressing than the firestorm of probation and penalties that had enveloped the football program. But, he said, there’s nothing he’d rather do than answer those challenges.
“One of the most pleasant things we have found is that there are really, really good people here,” McKay said. “Sure, there are things we could do better. But I can’t think of a better place to be.”
As for a return to law, McKay seems to think he has finally found a permanent vocation.
“It’s sort of in my blood,” McKay said of his ties to USC. “It fits.”

Los Angeles is criticized for its culture of superficiality, in which glamour, aesthetics and plastic surgery gloss over the city’s imperfections. Earlier this month, however, Los Angeles County took a significant step toward making real environmental progress by reducing our culture’s plasticity in the most literal sense: banning plastic bags.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to pass the ordinance on Nov. 16 by a partisan vote of 3-1. With past bans on disposable bags recently enacted in San Francisco and Malibu, Calif., environmentally conscious individuals have been pushing to extend the ordinance throughout the rest of California and make the state the first in the nation to impose blanket restrictions on plastic bags.
“We hope California can show other states that this is doable,” Gina Goodhill, a Los Angeles-based oceanography specialist for Environment California, told the San Diego Tribune. “We think this bill can be a model for other states to follow.”
The ban will directly affect nearly 1.1 million people in Los Angeles County who live outside the county’s incorporated cities. It does not, however, apply to the county’s incorporated cities.
Although 67 supermarkets and pharmacies must stop offering plastic bags by this July during the first phase of the ordinance, it won’t be until January of 2012 that the ban will affect the majority of  grocery stores — more than 1,000 throughout the county.
The legislation also aims to encourage customers to use reusable bags by enacting a 10-cent surcharge for every paper bag used as well.
“Plastic bags are a pollutant. They pollute the urban landscape. They are what we call in our county urban tumbleweed,” L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told the Los Angeles Times.
Although some people might argue that recycling plastic bags would be a better alternative to banning them altogether, the state’s past attempts to bolster recycling efforts for disposable bags suggest that this is not an efficient               solution. In California, more than 120,000 tons of bags are used each year, and less than 5 percent are recycled.
In addition to environmental clean up, the ban also offers financial incentives, as the ordinance would decrease the amount of money taxpayers pay annually for clearing disposable bags off the streets, which according to the Los Angeles Times, is almost $25 million a year.
Despite the financial and environmental benefits, however, opponents of the plastic bag ban express concern that smaller shops would be hurt financially because they won’t be able to purchase the larger-volume discounts for paper and reusable bags from which larger franchises benefit. Opponents worry that the extra cost of reusable bags is an unnecessary economic burden on small businesses.
“At a time of economic uncertainty, with a large number of businesses leaving our state and community, this would not be an appropriate time … to impose this additional regulation,” Supervisor Michael Antonovich, the ban’s lone dissenter, told the Los Angeles Times.
Another criticism of the plastic bag ban is that the patchy municipal laws, which only affect certain jurisdictions, can cause confusion. Rather than restricting the use of plastic bags only in areas of the county outside of the incorporated cities, the legislation should try to unify the regulation throughout the entire city of Los Angeles. With consistency throughout the county, shoppers would avoid confusion and large chain stores would be more efficient.
Although the plastic bag ban might initially cause disorder among specific chain grocery stores, the negative effects will be minimal. In the long-term, the ordinance will serve as an important step toward environmental cleanup.

You say “the extra cost of reusable bags is an unnecessary economic burden on small businesses.”  Can you please tell me what the burden is on small business if they no longer have to purchase plastic bags (which are given free to the customer) and must now sell reusable bags at a profit???  
Are you a journalist, Amir, or simply a parrot for nonsensical plastic bag manufacturers?
“Although some people might argue that recycling plastic bags would be a better alternative to banning them altogether”
The reason recycling is so low is that most groups like Heal the Bay began an anti-recycling campaign the day LA county supported a recycling and reduction ordinance.  Rather than encouraging recycling they proposed it was a failure befor it began and encouraged people to give up… 
Amazing that as a strategy to achieve extreme approach they actively undermined and blocked a moderate approach…this doesnt promise much for future moderate initiatives.

On Sunday, whistle-blowing website Wikileaks began its third major release of documents this year. Although the first two had targeted subject matter — the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — the latest (and largest) document dump covers virtually the entire gauntlet of topics that are critical to American national interests.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
The leak consists of 251,287 United States embassy cables, ranging from unclassified to secret. The cables reveal a variety of surprising pieces of information, including China’s privately communicated stances on North Korea and Iran, American spats with Russia and Turkey, requests by Arab leaders for intensified U.S. pressure on Iran, and American diplomats’ opinions of world leaders, including Robert Mugabe and Moammar Gadhafi.
Both current and former American officials, most notably Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former president George W. Bush, have condemned the leak as damaging to American interests as well as international order and peace.
They are right to do so. Though not all of the documents have been made public, a cursory scan of them is enough to make clear that they have the potential to stoke tensions and start conflicts around the world. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange seems to believe that these risks are “worth it,” but what is unclear is what exactly he is trying to accomplish by making the cables public.
This wasn’t always the case with Wikileaks. The first two leaks, although roundly condemned by U.S. and other officials for risking the safety of our troops, at least had a clear purpose.
By revealing sometimes-gruesome details about conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan, Assange was attempting to galvanize opposition to the wars and perhaps help bring them to a close sooner. Although the merits of that decision can certainly be debated, at least it was backed by legitimate, logical reasoning. This is not the case with the decision to publish the diplomatic cables.
On its website, Wikileaks tries to explain its reason for releasing the cables by saying, “The cables show the extent of U.S. spying on its allies and the U.N.; turning a blind eye to corruption and human rights abuse in ‘client states;’ backroom deals with supposedly neutral countries; lobbying for U.S. corporations; and the measures U.S. diplomats take to advance those who have access to them.
This document release reveals the contradictions between the U.S.’s public persona and what it says behind closed doors — and shows that if citizens in a democracy want their governments to reflect their wishes, they should ask to see what’s going on behind the scenes.”
If citizens want their governments to reflect their wishes — which presumably entails ensuring security and international stability, avoiding wars and creating economic growth — they must allow those governments to operate in some degree of secrecy. This is because the reality of international relations dictates that states take certain unsavory actions because they are the least bad option available.
All of the actions to which Assange objects — spying, tolerating corruption and human rights abuses, creating backroom deals — are sometimes necessary in order to avoid worse situations. It is unlikely that many Americans would object to spying in order to avoid war and minimize casualties if it does occur, maintaining a relationship with a corrupt dictator in order to avoid isolating his country’s people from the world or secretly agreeing to support Yemen’s president in his counterterrorism endeavors.
Moreover, even if one did object to these types of government actions, in reality it is futile to try preventing them in the future by publicizing the fact that they were taken in the past.
Governments are enormous, complex bureaucracies whose protocols are virtually impossible to change significantly even for their leaders, let alone a civilian armed with only limited information about isolated past incidents.
Any effort to markedly change the way states do business — including Assange’s — is doomed to fail. He did, however, succeed in damaging the United States’ attempt to guarantee its citizens safety, create prosperity and ensure international stability.
What is puzzling about this is that, given how obviously futile it is to try to create wholesale change in the international system by releasing a batch of diplomatic documents, Assange must have realized that he would potentially do more harm than good by doing so.
This leads to the conclusion that, unlike in the Iraqi and Afghan cases, Assange did not decide to leak the latest documents because of a deliberate anticipation of their effects.
Perhaps he has become so accustomed to his role as the world’s whistleblower that once he gained access to sensitive information he leaked it out of habit. Maybe he did it for attention, or maybe even out of malice.
Certainly, though, he did not do it out of wisdom.

Actually, I think this article is right on the mark and it’s insights are true. The only people who wouldn’t understand it would be those who haven’t truly come to grasp with the realities of this world, shame on you people for being so feeble and naive. How does releasing diplomatic cables of this nature benefit anyone at all? It only detracts from the image of the US and empowers their enemies with knowledge they would and should otherwise not have. How would you feel if your secrets and innermost thoughts were exposed to the world to see? I’m sure people would love having that kind of ammunition to decimate your life with.
I also love the repliers who criticize without offering any counterpoint or support to back their accusations. It really shows that they’re the epitome of intellectual or moral standing. Flame and blame because that’s all people these days have the brains to do. No one is smart enough to show that they can write or have thoughts beyond a preschool level. People also forget that in order to even have freedom in the first place one must have the power to take it and hold on to it. If you think just having a voice is enough, let’s pray that words hit just as hard as fists or bullets outside of dreamland.
Observer,
This has nothing to do with grasping the realities of this world. I understand the dangerous nature of the world we live in, and the things that the United States must sometimes do to preserve its interests.  I am not even necessarily against those things! I think there is a reasonable case that can be made for closing the WikiLeaks site, but I just don’t think this article comes close to that.  It just sounds amateur.  The author argues that Mr. Assange has no purpose in doing this, and that it he would just  “potentially do more harm than good by doing so.”  The author fails to understand that while it is the United States’ job to protect its secrets, it is not the job of reporters and private citizens to do this.  
Following the author’s logic, where no one should question or expose government wrongdoing when it has to do with national security, we never would have known about Iran Contra or the Pentagon Papers.  The end of the article is even worse, starting with, “Moreover, even if one did object to these types of government actions, in reality it is futile to try preventing them in the future by publicizing the fact that they were taken in the future.”  You tell me this isn’t a completely moronic statement.  That is exactly the way to stop abuses in the future.  Following the author’s logic that our government is way top big and bureaucratic to change, make better, or keep in line, then we would still be waterboarding suspects.  
Its just a really ill-thought article.  I’m not even against WikiLeaks being shut down, its just that this article’s draconian reasoning makes me want to throw up.
I am astonished at this blatent piece of propoganda against our freedoms. Im shocked at the website being hacked, the documents show the level of corruption and how little freedom we actually have, and here you are dissing him for releasing them, ending by saying he did it for attention, or out of malice, and certainly not out of wisdom. He did it out of kindness, he´s putting his ass on the line, risking everything as the US will do everything to destroy him to stop him showing how malicious and freedom destroying they really are. 
You should be ashamed of your biased asslicking
Teddi, 
I don’t think it is bias, I think this kid just doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  It’s like when you’re little and first learn about criminals and the law, and you think “Well anyone can search me, I have nothing to hide. Only the criminals have something to hide!”  
Just another unintelligent, uninformed article trying to sound opinionated and informed.
Is this a high school or university paper?  Such an elementary piece.
Sincerely,
Unimpressed

I’m a pre-med student; so is 12 percent of USC’s entering freshman class. But universities across the nation act as though they want that number to be much smaller.
Many science students have labeled certain courses “weed-out classes,” ones that are largely understood to filter out students hoping to attend medical school by overwhelming them with work and encouraging them to drop the classes and pursue a different area of study.
Universities aim to advertise favorable statistics about their undergraduate class, saying that a high percentage of pre-med graduates have been accepted to medical school.
Though these classes are meant to give students solid foundations in the sciences, they are also tools that universities use to improve the school’s rankings and reputation. And as USC looks to consistently improve upon both, it seems to have also embraced that competitive attitude when it comes to pre-med students.
Pre-med courses seem focused first and foremost around the process of filtration: separating the promising future medical student from those who would perhaps be better off in another field. Grading is all about relativity — the curve means everything in pre-med courses. Your score is dependent on the successes and failures of other students, a model which fosters competition rather than scholarship.
After exams, not only is the class average released, but often so is the minimum score. Invariably, students who see that they rank at the bottom of their class will want to drop the course and even switch career paths.
This means that the university is spared from including those students in its graduating pre-med student statistics.
There’s something very flawed with this approach. An introductory biology, chemistry or physics class is not necessarily an adequate reflection of what medical school and the medical profession will be like. When dealing with a patient, a knowledge of taxonomy or electron orbitals have marginal importance.
Memorization and regurgitation — skills that can guarantee good grades in introductory science classes — do not necessarily make good doctors. It’s time for USC and other schools to stop judging students based on their grades in lower division classes.
Many USC pre-med students are being indirectly told that they are unfit for the medical field based on their performance in such classes.
University officials encourage students to experiment and take different classes. But students interested in medical school are subliminally discouraged from taking introductory science courses simply because it’s so difficult to do well in these classes. Non-pre-med students who have interests in the sciences don’t take these courses for these reasons.
USC administrators need to approach their pre-med students with the students’ best interests in mind, instead of compromising their career aspirations for good statistics. Competitive classes should be restructured so that learning takes precedence over statistics.

Who on earth wants to be a doctor these days, anyway???? 
All you guys will end up going into specialties, where you think the money is, and there are far too many specialists out there already. All you guys will do is order procedures, procedures, and more procedures, because, again, that’s where the money is and you’ll need lots of it to pay off your student loans, and, coincidentally, it’s why our health care system is completely broken. 
You will pay more in overhead for personnel to file claims and dun people for money than you will in any other expense, even malpractice insurance. 
Many of you will start flogging for Big Pharma to make even more money, to make up for what you think you’re not getting but deserve, given all the hubris demonstrated above. Maybe you’ll even sign your name to bad research conducted and ghost-written by Big Pharma. Who knows? If trends continue, many of you will. 
“Physician prestige” is going the way of the dinosaurs, kids. You’re on a career path to being a robot. Use those fine minds for something useful, instead.
cool story bro
There are weed out courses, and it would be much better if some of the students at the top of the classes were weeded out based on personality, some MD’s belong in research and never near pt’s. Either way, medicine is a mess and anyone that is weeded out should not regret it, they may be much happier doing something else.
After having worked in healthcare for 30 years, we talked our son out of going to med school. He would have made a great physician and surgeon, but the hassles of medicine are not worth the price paid in hours and dollars.
Those that think Dr’s make a lot of money need to pay attention, the physicians in the front line (primary care) are having problems surviving, and all physicians are having constant issues getting paid from insurance. The hassles of being in medicine these days are beginning to outweigh the benefits. Too many physicians would do something else if they could even though they like the medicine part, the rest of it is driving them nuts. So those that are weeded out, it may be a blessing!
I know little to nothing about the med school route, but relevant or not, I’d prefer my doctors to be of above average intelligence and not at the bottom of the curve in undergrad, LOWER division basic courses.  I would also want my doctor to be competent in the sense that they are able to be resourceful.  What I mean by this is that if you don’t know the answer, be willing to admit it and bust your butt trying to find the answer.  If someone at the bottom of the curve put their absolute all into the class (got tutoring, went to office hours, etc.) and still was at the bottom, then maybe the medical field is not for them.  Understanding concepts on the most basic level is imperative in any field, whether the information is perceived as relevant or not.  On the other end of the spectrum, if the person at the bottom wasn’t resourceful and proactive, then I wouldn’t want them as my doctor, either.  Doctors hold people’s lives in their hands, and I don’t take that lightly.  A misdiagnosis can mean a person’s life; so frankly, I don’t care if people are “weeded out.”  If a person can be weeded out by one tough class, then they shouldn’t be in the medical profession.  Regardless of the university’s statistical intentions, it’s up to the person to step it up a notch and fight through it, and if they get discouraged by one lower division course, then I can’t see them getting through the next 7 years or however long it takes to become a doctor.
beautifully put!
You are hilarious. Just switch out, clearly you can’t handle being a pre-med, and most definitely won’t handle med school (as if you would have gotten in). The days of handholding are over. I hear Annenberg has openings, they’ll welcome people like you in open arms!
Don’t be so condescending. Some people’s passion isn’t med-school. Not everyone is obsessed with the titular prestige of “MD” or the big pay that goes along with it. Different strokes for different folks.
My cousin went to Cal Berkely as an undergrad. She was among of the top of her high school senior class (at a public high school putative for being academically very competitive (Pen High, Palos Verdes)); scored near perfect on her SATs (when it was the 1600 scale); took all honors/AP courses, etc. The O-chem and physics classes at Cal weeded her out. She switched to a “slacker” major, i.e. pyschology with an minor in Asian languages. 
Listen, not everyone is meant to be a physician. Pred-med is the most dreaded academic route, with engineering 2nd. Look at the average GPAs and MCAT scores of people admitted to med-schools. 
Sure, you probably aced high school level math and sciences courses…But this is collegiate level. All the people who couldn’t hack pre-med go to Marshall; at the UCs it’s either “management science” i.e. econ, or some useless liberal arts.
Oh now naive and cute you are… Competition is reality. Adjust now and stop writing about it. Classes don’t weed people out. There are just smart people and not so smart people. Medical school also has basic science courses. If one can’t succeed in undergraduate Chem 101, one will likely not succeed in the first year medical courses. As a biology instructor, seeing so many premed students make it to senior year and THEN get weeded out when they apply to medical school and are not accepted is pretty sad for me to watch–especially when they have no interest in science except to get into medical school. I think there should be an entrance exam to pre-med programs in undergraduate schools, or even more rigorous benchmarks along the way–barrier exams, for example–music schools have them–why not pre-med programs? This could fix a lot of senior year heart breaks…
Competition is not what the author is talking about.  Competition is good.  But competition where only 8% are allowed to get A’s, no matter how well one does or how much one learns, is plain ridiculous.  I’ve been in these courses and seen the students, and trust me, they don’t learn anything.  The one’s that get A’s, except for maybe a few, are the ones who have learned to game the system, find the answers, or just memorize for test questions.  They are not learning anything.
Furthermore, more than half of the stuff you learn in these premed classes have nothing to do with medicine and are hardly needed, and that is acknowledged by almost everyone.
Yes, one who can’t succeed in CHEM 101 might not succeed in Med School.  But when success means franticly beating out other students by studying for the test, cheating, or manipulating, then we’re no longer on the same page.
Thanks for the input bio instructor, but stick to teaching about the cell cycle and other useless things that most of your premed students will learn and unlearn as soon as they step out your class.
You’re right—you OBVIOUSLY know what you’re talking about… Thanks for totally changing my perspective.
You sound like a GREAT professor…..
I disagree. You’re adept at rationalizing. Perhaps you should switch to philosophy as your major.
I’m a med student at Keck from USC undergrad, and let’s not kid ourselves- this article is idiotic and the people who support the author are just as much so. Stop complaining and do the work. There are a limited number of seats for medical school with more people wanting to attend. Competition is inevitable… not only here, but in medical school and in your professional/personal life. The AMCAS obviously takes academics as a major factor, but they require numerous essays, letters of recommendations and a face to face interview before you’re even granted a seat. So if for some reason you can’t handle the mean, bad system, you can show them your other redeeming factors. But then again, this is medicine, and the AMCAS cites supporting literature on how science GPA and your MCAT is a strong predictor of medical school success. 
The pre-meds who can’t handle a curved class do not belong in medical school, plain and simple. Heck, with the few exams I’ve already taken, I’ve already been weeded out from dermatology/opthamology (2 residency seats at USC for example, for the thousands of medical students who apply). Do I blame the system? Sure as heck no, if it’s anybody’s fault, it’s my own.
Well written. I commend those who even make it into med-school because even the pre-med level is ultra difficult. My friend went to Vanderbilt for med-school, UCLA as an undergrad. He told me dermatology was up there when it came to “physician prestige” aka “big money,” lol! I wish I wasn’t so chicken about pursuing pre-med. Oh wells, I hope people like you raise the prestige of Keck med school; I read it rose in ranks recently. Good luck in everything.

Why do Hollywood treatments of real injustice tend to fall victim to their own impassioned convictions?
Fair Game, the new film from Doug Liman, arrives with the promise of finally lifting the curtains around the Bush administration’s highly publicized — and highly illegal — 2003 identity leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame and her contacts but really, the movie is as cloaked and muddled as it paints post-9/11 American politics.
A family apart · Fair Game shows how Valerie Plame’s (Naomi Watts) marriage to diplomat Joe Wilson (Sean Penn) led to her outing as a CIA agent in an act of political revenge. - Photos courtesy of Summit Pictures
Liman, who as of late has specialized in high octane trips around the globe such as The Bourne Identity and Mr. & Mrs. Smith — typically with a lot of firearms going off — gives us Naomi Watts as Plame and Sean Penn as her husband, Ambassador Joe Wilson.
The film opens with a handsomely dressed Plame in a foreign country — the exotic location amplified by the cunning use of African percussion amid the soundtrack — en route to a black tie event with a potential informant.
When the gloves come off and the sucker tries to bolt, Plame issues a single curt warning: “You have no idea what we can or cannot do.”
It’s an effective moment of establishment, one that will hopefully catch viewers off guard with the steely reserve of Plame, unyielding in her devotion to her job and its human demands.
What a shame then, that the rest of the picture skirts away at the speed of a drone to a narrative many of us are already quite familiar with.
We meet Wilson at a bar with friends — mostly conservative — bristling as their apathy of world affairs reveals itself in their half-drunken discourse.
For a moment, the picture latches onto the enticing question of how two government workers on opposite sides of the ethical plateau wind up married, but, unfortunately, Liman’s plans lie in the legislature of the story.
There’s a brief jaunt to Niger, where Wilson deduces that a shipment of cast iron tubes high on the White House’s list of reasons to invade Iraq are not the chemical weapons Washington thinks they are.
The report is printed, and the higher ups (in the form of Karl Rove) ignore it. Mr. Wilson angrily takes the administration to task in The New York Times and finally, that fateful order from Scooter Libby is approved, ousting Plame in an act of retribution for her husband’s published condemnation.
The anger that Liman seeks to uncork has already saturated much of the public consciousness — at least, those sectors politically unopposed to hearing it.
There is little to disagree with here, which makes for a self-satisfied editorial and an immensely underwhelming film. Nowhere does Fair Game take a moment to detach itself from the urgency of its story, instead plowing ahead toward the inevitable conclusion.
It’s a serious disservice to Watts and Penn, who imbue their characters with touching behavioral notes and, in certain moments, exude that unmistakable air of two people who have loved one another for a very long time.
The very brief scenes at home with their kids feel original, unstaged and authentic, while the first menacing phone call that Watts receives stinks of calculation. The call hastens the plot for those too burdened by emergency to deal with the pastoral glimpses of life before the leak.
Unfortunately, the film fails to reveal anything new, aside from regurgitating the facts of the story. This sort of ripped-from-the-headlines feature has been done before — and better.
Costa-Gavras treaded similar ground in Z, the 1969 thriller about a political assassination in Greece, and succeeded masterfully.  Gavras rolls the cameras generously before and after the fatal bludgeoning of Yves Montand’s leftist deputy, taking in the sickening unease of the crowds in the streets and the very relatable motivations of those paid to beat the kids to a pulp.
Even Paul Greengrass’s recent Green Zone explored similar issues with its graphic depiction of life for Iraqis and Americans alike beyond the fences of the Imperial City. It had an agenda, but still gave viewers a new perspective.
Brushing over the international implications of the Plame leak, we are mostly told that the leak has ruined Plame’s life at home, but how can one be bothered to empathize with Plame when so little of that life is illustrated?
The arguments, as the overtly defensive Wilson and the more subordinate Plame debate the best course of action, are deflated by the lurking suspicion that perhaps at the end of this despairing journey, there is little to fight for.
When the real Plame is finally seen in archival footage, seated before the Supreme Court, the effect is bewildering.
Perhaps Liman’s picture is destined for a second life, as a mouthpiece on mass media’s trending effect of fictionalizing fact.
One can only hope, for as an outcry of partisan backstabbing, Fair Game is painfully quiet.
You must have run out for more popcorn.  Joe Wilson went to Niger to look into British allegations of Sadaam purchasing 500 tons of yellowcake uranium, not centrifuge tubes.  I gave the movie 9 out of 10 stars.  I’ve never given a movie a perfect score.

Although some students will sigh with relief that it’s finally the home stretch of the semester; the more pragmatic among us see the gap between Thanksgiving and winter break for what it really is: a desperate struggle to the bitter end, chock-full of all-nighters, term papers and final exams.
The last thing anyone wants to think about is food. But before one succumbs to a diet of Pop-Tarts and Carl’s Jr., consider this: how much more relaxing would it be to come home to a hot, hearty meal before hitting the books or having tasty cold cuts to cram into a fresh sandwich?
The science backs good eats. Too much sugar and refined carbohydrates sap energy and lead to sugar crashes and cravings. Balanced, whole meals improve focus and energy, and you can make them yourself.
Read on for tasty comfort food that will fill you up and warm your bones — and can be prepared in much less time than the Food Network would make you believe.
Roasts and bakes are filling, warming and look far more complicated than they actually are. Because of the volume of meat, you will have tons of leftovers. The roasting pan also serves as a vessel for tasty side dishes.
Remember those Sunday family dinners where Dad sliced into a juicy roast and the potatoes gleamed with butter? Recreate the experience right in your apartment. All you need is a roasting pan — even a one-time use one from Superior will do.
Boneless rump roast is classic, but the leaner sirloin tip and top-round roasts also work. For seasoning, simply rub the roast in garlic or garlic powder, salt, pepper and a little butter or olive oil. Roast at 375 degrees, 20 minutes for each pound of beef. Before sticking the roast in the oven, however, add some vegetables to the pan, such as potatoes, carrots and celery.
Roast chicken can be prepared the exact same way, but remember to take out the gizzards if you purchased a whole chicken. Again roast at 375 degrees, 20 minutes for each pound of meat, but add an additional 10-20 minutes. If you have a roasting rack, now is the time to use it, but if not, no worries.
Even if the time seems considerate, use it as a way to make yourself curl up with your kinesiology book. You will get work done and have a delicious dinner waiting for you as you wrap up glycolysis. Plus, a roast will last one person several days.
If you have a Costco-sized bag of chicken breasts that need to be used up, baked chicken is always a comfort classic that’s as simple as it is tasty. For cream of mushroom chicken, just dump four chicken breasts into a baking dish, add a can of cream of mushroom soup, pepper and some additional mushrooms and onions if you are feeling really frisky. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. This dish was made for a side of rice and sautéed veggies.
In vegetarian cooking, a big bake is just as easy. For some Southwestern comfort, start by cooking three-fourths cup of rice. Combine the rice in a baking dish with these ingredients: one can each of black beans, tomatoes with green chilies, and corn; 1 cup each of salsa and sour cream; and one-fourth teaspoon of pepper.
Top with a small can of black olives and one-half cup of onion, and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. For the final step, sprinkle on 1 cup of your favorite cheese and bake for an additional five to 10 minutes. Let it sit for another 10 minutes before serving.
If you survived your savory baking adventure, you probably have a week’s worth of leftovers. The next day, whip up a sandwich or wrap with cold chicken or beef. To really jazz up your sandwich, add a tasty spread like hummus, pesto, spicy mustard or tomato paste.
Of course, a sandwich calls for bread. If you happen to have a bottle of beer and some self-rising flour you need to get rid of, you can make your own beer bread. Simply combine 3 cups of sifted or spooned-out self-rising flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar and a 12-ounce can of beer.
If you only have regular flour, add 3 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Bake at 375 degrees for one hour, and you’ve just made yourself a baker.
But baking is a science, and some people would rather man the stove. If you want a quick study break, a great use for leftover beef (or even chicken) is hash. Think of hash as a lumberjack’s stir-fry — start by adding a pat of butter or drizzle of oil to a pan on medium-high heat. Then, add some chopped onions, bell peppers if you have them, and potatoes (unless you are using leftover potatoes from your roast beef).
When the onions have started to cook through, add the roast beef (and potatoes if they are leftovers). Cook until warmed through, stirring occasionally, and add salt and pepper to taste. Hash pairs well with toast and ketchup.
If you have a ton of vegetables in your fridge or freezer to use up, opt for a stir-fry instead.
In a large pan, add the hard vegetables first (such as onions and carrots), followed by softer ones such as broccoli or snap peas. Finally, add the leftover chicken or beef. You can also add flavorings like soy sauce. Add any ultra-soft vegetables last, like spinach, and cook until warmed through.
Top with anything you want — just because it’s an Asian-inspired dish doesn’t mean you can’t use up the last of your Thousand Island dressing.
Another great way to use up leftover chicken is in a baked potato. Simply zap a potato in the microwave and while it’s cooking, combine chopped chicken with veggies like broccoli and onions and a handful of cheese in a bowl.
When the potato is done, carefully cut it open and stuff with the remaining ingredients. Sprinkle with some salt, pepper and additional cheese and microwave for another minute, or until the cheese has melted. Add your favorite toppings like sour cream or barbecue sauce and dig in.
Just because it’s finals season doesn’t mean you need to drag your body over coals. When you feel better, you perform better, so never think a comforting meal is more than a refrigerator-raid away.

When the first track of Abby Gogo’s album filters in through your headphones, you’ll fiddle with the connection and wonder if there is something wrong with the sound.
The first notes of “Louder than Dreams” pan to the right earphone before exploding into the left — and just like that, you’re off into an entrancing, sometimes chaotic flurry of noise.
The album has almost everything you could want from a band AOL Spinner describes as “psych-garage rockers,” from virtuously messy drum fills to a heavy fixation on guitar feedback.
The album consists of only eight tracks, which gives the band a minimal amount of time to create a catchy debut album. At times the music skews a psychedelic and shoegazer with a touch of garage rock, and all the expected elements are there — the ephemeral, echoing voice and the mix of instruments creating a loud sound clothed in a smooth, calm mood.
But all labels aside, the music creates its own imaginary realm in which the flighty voices of Bon and Jon Allinson suggest that pretty much anything goes.
“Louder than Dreams” gives listeners just enough to give them a sense of what kind of musical world they’re about to dip their feet into. The drums bounce around and occasionally create complex and sped-up fills that push the song into various tempos.
The guitar chords remain mostly the same, guiding the listener gently through the rest of the track. And when it comes to Bon Allinson’s singing, he doesn’t try too hard — he just lets the sounds roll out and presents unadulterated lyrics.
You must have a trained ear to cut through the frenzy of the feedback. The grating sound of a guitar crying at its highest notes can prove to be a little overwhelming to listeners not accustomed to it. But anyone with a penchant for the fuzzy sounds can feed happily on them throughout the album.
“Torpedo” gives you a dose of haunting sounds blended with the uncanny wails emanating from the guitar. Dual vocalists and guitarists Bon and Jon Allinson refuse to make it an easy listen as they launch into as escapade of melancholic frenzy.
The song starts off with a harmony that sounds timid and disjointed. The pace of the song remains mostly subdued and at times turns a little sleepy, the energy waning in Allinson’s voice, which recedes into a calm, almost morose tone.
The initial suspense created by a repetitive guitar becomes monotonous, finally peaking in a sudden onslaught of screeching and whining feedback that takes what feels like a few minutes at the end of the song.
A crying guitar here and there adds the right spice but the continuous and seemingly never-ending note makes it almost unbearable to listen to. For those not accustomed to such subdued sounds, the repetitive, screeching chords make it difficult not to move on to the next track.
But the boys aren’t ready to let you go just yet.
“Guitar #0” throws in a bit of synthesized keyboard and tries to reel you back in. Unfortunately, the drumming in this track remains basic, but it surprisingly keeps a constant, swaying rhythm that forces you to let loose a little and enjoy the quirky beat. If you’re looking for something conventional and Top 40, you’re listening to the wrong album. But if you want layers that you can appreciate without necessarily understanding, this is the album for you.
After tracks that are similar in style, the listener starts searching for something else that will break up the monotony. With eight tracks, the guys can surely create a neat little package, but they have to keep their audience engaged too.
“Feelin’ Slow” offers a surprisingly different mood. The sounds get more pop and Allinson’s voice becomes more accessible and less fleeting. His slow vocals fits in more with the instruments than in previous tracks.
“Come On” is a love song but also the detailing of life with all its complexities. The lyrics gets surprisingly simple and communicate everyday actions. In this track, the guys step down a little from their shoegazer sheen; where before the lyrics seemed more like chants that were far from understandable, here the lyrics are crisp.
Bon playfully sings, Hooray, hooray / the bills are paid / I think I’ll go out and play, but turns the childlike mindset a touch darker with the lyrics, cut through like a razor blade / the damage has just begun.
This clever juxtaposition makes the track the biggest standout. Although the mysteriously indiscernible nature of the Allinsons’ voices create a dream atmosphere in the previous tracks, the power of the language comes through here without the aid of an echo effect. The band’s attitude gets a little easier to understand with these clearer lyrics but remains enigmatically thrilling as you take a trip into the mind of the songwriters, where things seem far from simple.
The album could almost be described as cookie-cutter, but the intent is sincere and the potential is definitely there. Creating an absolutely perfect debut album is rare and the opportunity to grow through further albums presents the band with an opportunity to show what they’ve got.
The tracks show a mixed set of skills and Abby Gogo needs merely to clean up its act a bit. It takes a little bit of musical courage and letting go of conventional standards to really understand the album, but what’s music if it doesn’t make you step outside of your boundaries?

I first stumbled across photographer and filmmaker Sharon Lockhart’s work as a disinterested middle schooler.
Oblivious to artistic concepts of created fiction spawned by my city’s film industry, I was merely a 12-year-old on a forced field trip to the Museum of Contemporary Art’s Geffen Contemporary building when I was struck by five large-scale photos of adolescents suspended in the moment before a kiss.
Work on loan to MOCA by Rodney MacMillian and Susanne Vielmetter 
The photos’ lighting and dramatic angle alludes to cinematic aesthetics and I was sucked into the emotional expression locked on each of the children’s faces.
Even after I was yanked away and thrown back on the school bus to the San Fernando Valley, the image of children my age acting out intimate moments meant for adults became burned in my memory as the first art piece that I truly connected with.
Twelve years later, on a more informed trip to the same museum, I again came face to face with the current USC professor’s seminal portraits. This time, however, had context.
Titled “Audition One” through “Audition Five,” the photos were back on the walls of MOCA’s Geffen Contemporary as a part of The Artist’s Museum, MOCA’s newest exhibit highlighting more than 30 years of Los Angeles artists who have shaped contemporary art dialogues.
Spread between both the Geffen Contemporary building and the museum’s main Grand Avenue location, the exhibit is not only a comprehensive show-and-tell for Los Angeles’ cultural contributions, but also for MOCA itself.
Mainly culled from MOCA’s permanent collection — with selections on loan from private owners as well as original commissioned works — The Artist’s Museum is a sign of life after nearly two years of financial crisis that cut exhibitions and produced talks of merging the world-class institution with crosstown rival LACMA.
But after a meager 2009 budget brought only one traveling retrospective to the Grand Avenue location (it usually sees four to five), MOCA’s latest homespun show proves that a lack of funds does not mean a lack of creativity.
In drawing from its own massive holdings, The Artist’s Museum proves artists in Los Angeles are leaders in postmodern critique, and places MOCA — as the city’s only museum dedicated exclusively to post-World War II art— at the center of the ongoing conversation.
In addition to Lockhart’s “Audition” series — which was inspired by forced fictions in film — the Geffen Contemporary part of the exhibition houses a multitude of sculpture, mixed-media and video installations from across the visual spectrum.
In one room, a wax superhero sculpture formed out of hubcaps coexists with abstract forms that emulate the growth of oak trees in nature. A collage of Los Angeles Times “Home” section cutouts that facetiously suggests we sell pricey houses to buy aircraft carriers for the government leads museumgoers into a screening room where the tale of a fictional all-girl theatrical prog-rock band (played by ventriloquist dummies) is on a 14-minute loop.
Also on the USC front, Roski School of Fine Arts professor Andrea Zittel installed lab-worthy cages signifying the elite’s need for designer pets while USC alumna Amanda Ross-Ho displayed two pieces newly acquired by the museum that use found images to negotiate the ideas of objectivity and subjectivity.
Compared to the large-scale installation and sculptural pieces at the Geffen Contemporary, the Grand Avenue half of the exhibit is, on the other hand, mostly two-dimensional. Lining the walls are photos, paintings, silkscreens and line drawings from recognizable L.A. artists such as Raymond Pettibon, Robbie Conal, Robert Irwin and Mark Ryden.
The visual contrasts between many of the pieces might make their placements appear haphazard, but they do carry thematic, if not geographic, ties. Raymond Pettibon’s old Black Flag concert fliers, for example, converse with singer Devendra Banhart’s tribal line drawings across the hall to show the different ways that art and music have intersected in the city.
And Long Beach’s post-industrial landscape captured in Bill Viola’s “Anthem” runs well with Long Beach-born Ed Moses’ abstract brush strokes by highlighting how one area of the city can influence different artistic reactions.
Placing local artists in conversation with one another is a first for MOCA, whose recent exhibition, “Collection: MOCA’s First Thirty Years,” attempted to showcase the institution’s international breadth.
And although it’s true that Los Angeles’ penchant for experimentation has made it an international art hub, The Artist’s Museum displays how that environment has affected the city’s own creative community.
By drawing lines of influence and creating new associations between works created since the museum opened in 1979, the exhibition connects several generations of local artists as a way to symbolize MOCA’s own success.
As the institution continues to struggle out of its financial debt, The Artist’s Museum is a reminder of the museum’s importance to both artists and art-lovers in Los Angeles. The inclusion of works previously displayed at MOCA — such as Lockhart’s “Audition” series — easily personalizes this sentiment for anyone who has visited the museum before.
Unlike the previous show, assembled exhibits thrown together in what felt like an attempt to fill space, The Artist’s Museum is full of positivity for the future.
The fact that the presentation is temporary signifies that MOCA is on its way, and with four dynamic exhibitions already slated for next year, the museum appears to be on track to resume its former greatness.

Christmas time is just around the corner, but for many students, figuring out how to celebrate can be an overwhelming process.
This year it’s time to forget about routine traditions and venture into the city. Los Angeles and the entirety of Southern California offers an enormous variety of shows and activities.
The best events are those geared toward all types of people: young, old, jolly and grouchy. From parades to ballets, California offers a wide variety of wintry excursions that should not be overlooked, no matter how much of a Scrooge you are.
The Nutcracker
Multiple companies across the state perform this show every winter, enchanting viewers with the ballet’s colorful and creative spin on the magic of Christmas.
Those unfamiliar with the plot (although most likely acquainted with the famous “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy”) will be instantly immersed in a fantastical world of candy, gingerbread cookies and a battle of epic proportions between a goodhearted nutcracker and the evil Mouse King.
Candy Cane and Christmas Tree Lanes
Looking for dazzling lights to enhance your holiday spirit?  Both Candy Cane Lane and Christmas Tree Lane are local hot spots to travel to for some of the best Christmas lights in Southern California.
Located in Woodland Hills, Calif., Candy Cane Lane in eight blocks of Christmas is all its neon splendor. Lights can be seen nearly everywhere in this thrilling spectacle: on houses, palm trees and even cars.
Christmas Tree Lane, however, is not just a holiday celebration — it’s a national landmark. Almost a mile-long stretch of deodar cedar trees dot Santa Rose Avenue in Altadena, Calif., and for the last 90 years the trees have been decorated in mounds of colorful lights.
The Bob Baker Marionettes — The Nutcracker
If you can’t make it to a real ballet performance of Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker, the Bob Baker Marionettes offer a solid replacement.
Puppet shows might sound childish, but such an undertaking of The Nutcracker makes it worth attending — and a cheaper alternative than the large cast versions. Skillful puppeteers have the ability to captivate both children and adults alike with their precise movements and the utilization of decorative miniature backdrops.
Performances last throughout January, and admission is $20 per person.
51st Annual Los Angeles County Holiday Celebration
You can’t possibly enjoy Christmas Eve without attending a jubilant gathering such as this. Los Angeles County’s annual holiday celebration is a collection of dances, performances, films and all-out partying.
Not only is parking and admission free, but the event also ends in the early evening to allow children and adults enough time to relax at home before Santa’s arrival. The celebration takes place at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center.
Downtown on Ice
It might not snow in Los Angeles, but that doesn’t mean Angelenos can’t enjoy a classic winter activity: ice skating.
Not far from USC, Pershing Square has been transformed into an outdoor ice skating rink. This winter marks the tradition’s 13th year, and at just $6 for admission and $2 to rent skates, a day at the rink is worth every penny.
Downtown on Ice also features free holiday-inspired events, including an arts and crafts festival, a menorah lighting and a number of concerts.
Disneyland and Universal Studios
What could be better than visiting an amusement park on earth on Christmas Day? Both Disneyland and Universal Studios have shifted gears for wintertime, bringing mini-lights and snow to their grounds.
Disneyland’s fairy-tale castle has been transformed into a crystal palace. Other areas of the park contain ornaments and Christmas trees and the nightly fireworks festival has been revamped to incorporate more holiday-inspired themes.
At Universal Studios, the Grinch has taken over. Starting Dec. 11, Universal will be transformed into a mock version of Whoville — with real snow — and will feature celebrity readings of Dr. Seuss’s beloved tale How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Even the Grinch himself will make an appearance, opening up his two-sizes-too-small heart to dance and take photographs with visitors.
Concerts
Los Angeles is nothing if not a city to see great concerts, and the holiday season is no exception. In anticipation of the holidays, many of the major L.A. radio stations will put on shows with big lineups.
KROQ’s “Almost Acoustic Christmas” is a two-night show perfect for rock ‘n’ roll fans. The first night at the Gibson Amphitheatre on Dec. 11 skews toward the ’90s alternative genre, with bands such as Bad Religion, Jimmy Eat World and Cake. The Smashing Pumpkins and Social Distortion will headline the show, along with My Chemical Romance.
Dec. 12’s show is geared toward today’s indie/alternative sound, as Phoenix headlines a lineup featuring The Black Keys, The Temper Trap and Florence + the Machine.
If your tastes run more toward hip-hop, Power 106’s “Cali Christmas” is perfect for you. On Friday, the Gibson Amphitheatre will play host to modern hit artists such as Pitbull and Chris Brown, along with rapper Ice Cube.
But if it’s pop music you want, KIIS FM’s  “Jingle Ball” on Sunday is for you. Hosted in Nokia Theatre in L.A. Live, the lineup includes Enrique Iglesias and pop starlet Katy Perry.
So if Los Angeles is your home for the holidays, go out and celebrate the season. Even in the City of Angels, there are more than a few festive things to do.

FBI officials said a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia attempted to detonate a bomb during a tree lighting in downtown Portland, Ore., the day after Thanksgiving — though the bomb was a fake, created by FBI agents posing as his accomplice.
Though officials said the crowds at the packed tree lighting were never in any danger, “The threat was very real,” Arthur Balizan, special agent in charge of the FBI in Oregon, told the Los Angeles Times. “Our investigation shows that Mohamud was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale.”
Mohamed Osman Mohamud, who was, at the time, a 19-year-old student at Oregon State University, told FBI agents posing as Al Qaeda operatives in August that he wanted to place a bomb during the packed annual ceremony. (The festive ceremony took place on the busiest shopping day of the year and usually brings thousands of people to the plaza.)
According to the Times, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to detonate the fake bomb — made of drums, diesel fuel and a large box of screws — by dialing his cell phone. The phony explosives were hidden in a white van parked near the plaza.
Mohamud has been charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will appear in court on Monday, according to FBI officials.

The USC-UCLA football game this weekend might spark little interest nationwide for the first time this in many years, but that doesn’t mean the students have forgotten about the game.
In what appears to be the first attack of the week, an individual or group put red dye in three fountains at UCLA early Monday morning. Not surprisingly, USC students are the suspected culprits.
“The clue was the red dye,” UCLA police spokeswoman Nancy Greenstein told the Los Angeles Times.  “Things like this are not unusual this time of year.”
In fact, this time last year, some people broke open a tarp covering the bronze bear statue in the middle of UCLA’s campus and poured yellow and red paint on it. This year, that bear is completely concealed in a wooden box and students are guarding it much like the Trojan Knights guard Tommy Trojan the week preceding the game.
The dye poured into the UCLA fountains is not expected to cause permanent damage, though the cost of draining and refilling them has yet to be determined, according to the Daily Bruin. And, as far as we can tell, there has been no retaliation from UCLA students on USC’s campus as of yet.

Some way or another — between my cousin’s contributions to Thanksgiving, a Sunday trip to the Hollywood farmer’s market, a particularly appealing Safeway sale, my own attempts to check the functionality of my grandmother’s smoke alarms and various other scenarios — I ended up eating an inordinate amount of candied nuts over break, which has left me with a ravenous, daily craving for more.
Luckily, candied nuts are easily in the realm of a college student’s cooking arsenal, with the cooking effort consisting primarily of stirring and baking. The perfect nut will be a balance of sweet, salty and, for the daring, some lingering heat.
Infinitely customizable, a big batch can take, at most, ten minutes to make, and will feed you for a full finals week.
Candied Nuts
1 egg white
1 tbs water
1 lb. of nuts (one variety or a mix)
½ cup of brown sugar
¼ tsp vanilla extract
¾ tsp salt
½ tsp cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees, and grease/line with a baking sheet.
Whisk together the egg white and water until foamy and slightly opaque. Stir together the sugar, vanilla, salt and cinnamon in a separate bowl.
Add the nuts to the egg whites, coating evenly. Then toss the nuts in the sugar mixture. Spread them out evenly on the baking sheet.
Bake for an hour in the oven, stirring every 20 minutes.
Try modifying the flavors by replacing the cinnamon with other spices — Chinese five spice, espresso powder or chili powder, for instance.

A freshman student died Wednesday night after Department of Public Safety officials found her unresponsive and not breathing in her dorm room, officials said.
DPS officers responded to the room of Rachel Kim, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism who lived on the sixth floor of Pardee Tower, after receiving a call at 8:41 p.m, said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
“The Los Angeles City Fire Department Unit 15 was also notified and responded to the scene,” Carlisle said. “[Kim] was transported to California Hospital and was later pronounced dead.”
The cause of death has not yet been released. Carlisle said privacy rules prevented him from giving more information.
According to her roommate, Molly Keam, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, Kim had been talking and laughing with Keam moments before she collapsed.
“Everything was going fine,” Keam said.
A counseling session will be held on Thursday at 7 p.m. for residents of the sixth floor of Pardee; another session will be held at 8 p.m. in the Pardee Tower second-floor lobby for all Pardee residents, Michael L. Jackson, vice president of student affairs, wrote in an e-mail to Pardee residents.
“Our hearts and prayers go out to Rachel’s family and friends,” Jackson said. “We know that this tragedy will weigh heavily on our community and please know that we want to support all of you.”
For immediate support, students can contact DPS dispatch at (213) 740-6000 to speak with a counselor.

A USC professor has been appointed the first vice dean of students for the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, a position designed to help increase opportunities for students.
College Dean Howard Gillman appointed Donal Manahan as the vice dean, who will take on the task of increasing the amount of services the College provides to students in terms of research, community engagement, global studies and internships.

Manahan said he will be handling student experiences that take place outside the world of academia.
“We at USC recognize that there are two parts to a student’s education: the formal part that takes place in the classroom and then there’s the outside-of-the-classroom experiences such as an internship or research experience,” Manahan said. “I feel my responsibilities lie with these out-of-classroom experiences.”
Manahan has been a professor of biological sciences at USC for more than 25 years. He has held a variety of positions during his career at the university, including director of the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies and chair of the Department of Biological Sciences.
“Professor Manahan has demonstrated over the years a fundamental commitment to the quality of the undergraduate experience in USC College,” Gillman said in an e-mail. “He has been one of our most powerful advocates for the centrality of a letters, arts and sciences education for a person’s personal and professional development.”
Manahan will be working closely with Steven Lamy, vice dean for academic programs, to provide students at the College with a complete understanding of their chosen field of study.
One project they are working on together is the issue of graduation rates at the College.
“Our graduation rate is very good, but we need to improve it. Our six-year graduation rate is at about 89 percent but we want to be at 90 percent or 91 percent,” Lamy said. “So that would one of the focal points — to help students graduate on time.”
Manahan has taken on several other projects since his appointment, one of which is the College First Year Investigations. The concept of College FYI is to guide incoming freshman that are undecided about their major and immediately pair them with a faculty member to form a mentorship.
This will take the form of a two-unit course and aims to provide students with someone other than their advisers to turn to for academic guidance.
Another field that Manahan said he hopes to promote to students is research.
“We are a major research university. Now the challenge is making sure that students take advantage of that,” he said. “We want to see more and more ways in which students can enter that culture of learning with research.”
Ultimately, Manahan said he wants to provide students with an experience during their time at USC that extends beyond the classroom.
“I’m very passionate about this because it transformed my life as a student. Somebody opened doors for me to let me work in a different learning environment,” Manahan said. “I would be so proud if I could open those doors for hundreds and hundreds of students.”
