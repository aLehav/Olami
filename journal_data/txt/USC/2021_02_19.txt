USC’s research labs face more accusations of animal cruelty, after a nonprofit watchdog group Stop Animal Exploitation NOW! obtained internal USC reports alleging that lab members performed unnecessary amputations on mice, knowingly created excessive neck wounds on pigs and overdosed mice with opioids. The University is currently in an ongoing lawsuit regarding animal cruelty accusations, filed by SAEN last year. 
The nonprofit organization, which works to expose laboratory animal abuse, obtained the reports through a Freedom of Information Act early February. USC reported the violations, occurring in 2019 and 2020, in letters to the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. The letter explained that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee voted to suspend the lab’s animal use protocol for 90 days, barred all individuals involved from accessing the animal facility and made plans to prevent future occurrences.
SAEN filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Tuesday, for the University’s “clear violation of the Animal Welfare Act.” The complaint is in regards to the lab allegedly creating nine wounds on pig necks during surgery, when the lab was only authorized to create three.
“There’s clearly no way of knowing what was in the mind of the people that did these things, but making neck injuries on pigs in what was supposed to be an experiment, in a situation where you’re not going to be able to use the information, or even a report that you did that because it violates your own protocol?” said Executive Director of SAEN Michael A. Budkie in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I mean, this is extremely disturbing.”
The other alleged violations in the USC reports — 14 cages of mice overdosed with Buprenorphine SR and found to have surgeries performed incorrectly according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols, as well as four adult mice with amputated ears despite lab technicians lacking approval — were not included in the complaint, as the Act does not cover rats and mice. 
The complaint calls upon the USDA to issue the maximum fine allowable to USC, which is $10,000 per infraction, per animal.
The group also wrote a letter to President Carol Folt and the Board of Trustees that requested an independent investigation of USC’s animal experimentation system and claimed nothing had appeared to change since the last time SAEN contacted the University about animal abuse. 
In the letter to Folt, Budkie wrote that the response from the University was “nowhere near sufficient,” and called on USC to terminate the lab members for their “heinous acts.” 
“The question that has to be raised here is: was this simply gratuitous violence against these animals? And that is certainly what it appears,”Budkie said. “I’ve been working on the animal research issue on one level or another since 1986. I can count on, probably one hand, the number of times that I’ve run across information that appears to be intentional animal abuse. And now, two of those situations have occurred at USC.”
In response to the reports, USC sent a statement to the Daily Trojan asserting that the reports demonstrate the University’s commitment to the ethical and human treatment of animals in research. 
“It was the university that first discovered these incidents and self-reported them to National Institutes of Health,” the statement read. “The university has since taken a number of steps, including enhanced retraining, to help ensure that they don’t reoccur.” 
In June 2019, SAEN filed a lawsuit against the University for allegedly routinely violating mandatory research protocols and animal welfare laws and regulations. According to the lawsuit, USC was accused of killing baby animals by placing them in a carcass-disposal freezer while still alive, performing unauthorized surgeries and injections on animals and withholding post-operative care such as pain killers from animals — among other alleged violations. The most recent violations will be included in the ongoing lawsuit, Budkie said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
In the statement, USC also denied SAEN’s allegations in the lawsuit.
“The university is highly committed to the ethical and humane treatment of animals in research, and meets or exceeds all accrediting and regulatory standards,” the University wrote.
Correction: A previous article stated that SAEN filed a complaint with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

USC is planning for a full return to campus life for Fall 2021 including in-person classes and residential life, according to a Universitywide email sent by President Carol Folt Friday. Folt said that planning for protective measures such as a campus vaccination operation, testing program and physical distancing measures as well as classroom and outdoor facility reconfiguration is already underway.
“Given the decline in cases and the vaccine rollout, we are planning for a full return to campus for the Fall semester, with in-person classes and residential life,” Folt wrote.
The email cited a decline of more than 80% of new coronavirus cases from the mid-December peak along with the decrease of hospitalization cases. Los Angeles County recorded 2,873 new cases Thursday. As of Friday, more than 1.6 million vaccine doses have been administered. Vaccines are currently in short supply but are expected to improve over the next few weeks, according to the email.
While USC does not expect to get approval for in-person classes this semester, facilities such as the libraries, swimming pools, outdoor recreation areas and study canopies will be open at a reduced capacity. The USC bookstore opened this week for appointment shopping. 
The University is also currently developing plans for commencement and considering options such as using the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for an in-person event with limited guests along with an immersive virtual celebration. These plans include the class of 2020 and will be updated mid-March. 
“With conditions improving and vaccine distribution now being ramped up, many of us are feeling a sense of hope about this pandemic that we haven’t felt for a long time.” Folt wrote in the email. “We are cautiously optimistic and are doing everything to make sure our plans for a return are fully realized.”

When the coronavirus pandemic forced USC to send students home in March 2020, many found themselves struggling with the brand-new concept of virtual learning. Online coursework requires a monumental adjustment of learning styles — a particularly difficult transition for performing arts students.
As a student with a music industry minor, I can personally vouch for the strain of online music classes. Instead of analyzing music in a classroom setting, I found myself sitting in front of my computer, struggling to discern between the techno sounds of electronic dance music and Zoom glitches, between stylistic choices and buffering.
Such difficulties were only exacerbated for students whose studies are rooted in musical performance. The Thornton School of Music, however, bounced back quickly, launching its USC Thornton/LIVE program mid-March, days after students left campus.
USC Thornton/LIVE is a virtual stage of sorts, featuring performances from musicians in the school. The performances are streamed live and are available to students, faculty, parents and the larger online community.
The virtual stage offers not only performance practice for its music students but also a platform for USC’s music program to connect with those off campus or even outside of the Los Angeles area. It’s a silver-lining in the pandemic — now, anyone (or, rather, anyone with the link) can be a part of USC’s phenomenal music community.
The program demonstrates how Thornton students and faculty are a picture of perseverance. 
“Concerts have been canceled, campus is closed, but the show must go on,” @USCThornton tweeted last March, introducing the Thornton/LIVE program. “Living rooms, offices, garages — wherever we are, we keep the music playing.”
The immense dedication of Thornton’s performers is a testament to their ability to adapt and showcase their talents, regardless of whether their stage is founded on concrete or on a broadcast. As the program’s website states, “Thornton/LIVE celebrates the resiliency and creativity of Thornton students, alumni, faculty, and staff.”
For those of you questioning whether you really want to spend your free time watching a musical performance, I can assure you Thornton/LIVE is anything but boring. From classical orchestral music to brand new, student-composed electronic dance music, Thornton’s virtual stage has a performance for everyone.
Watching a live-streamed performance on the Thornton/LIVE website is almost like watching a normal, pre-coronavirus performance — if pre-coronavirus performances were prone to audiences dancing along in their own bedroom, as I do.
I am writing not only to commend the flexibility of Thornton’s talent, but also because I am a USC music student who has struggled during the pandemic to navigate the virtual world. Left alone with my thoughts in my childhood bedroom, far away from campus, I contemplated dropping my music industry minor — what good was music if I couldn’t enjoy its performance? — but coming across the performances on the Thornton/LIVE stage reignited my passion for music.
I’m not trying to say music is a passion for everyone, and I’m certainly not trying to indoctrinate you with the powers of music. It is important, however, to remember that while a reinvigoration of passions and hobbies may be what’s getting you and me and many others through this difficult time, others are finding themselves lost in the monotony of our new pandemic lives.
Whether music is a passion of yours or not, I highly recommend watching at least one Thornton/LIVE performance. You may find something you love or something you hate, but either way we can all appreciate a good chunk of musical relaxation, and, of course, support our fellow Trojans in the process.
Performances are live-streamed and are only available to view for a limited time after the initial broadcast, so make sure you’re up-to-date with their schedule so you don’t miss a single performance on Thornton’s fantastic virtual stage.

Alexander Glantz, better known as Alexander 23, discussed his upcoming EP “Oh No, Not Again!” at a virtual press conference hosted by Universal Music Group’s °1824 last Thursday.  
The triple threat — singer, songwriter and producer — candidly talked about his creative process, advice and goals with music-making during a pandemic. 
His singles “IDK You Yet” and “Cry Over Boys” have garnered major attention on TikTok, with over one million views on the first teasers he posted. Now, both songs have millions of plays on Spotify. 
These two songs seem to resonate the most with listeners, as both explore similar themes of feeling attached to someone they haven’t even met. Though “Cry Over Boys” seems to call out his listeners, Glantz explained how he saw himself in the lyrics.
“I can kind of fall into a cycle of really romanticizing romance in a way where I put my want for love or a partner ahead of my actual happiness,” Glantz said.
The young and talented artist established himself so quickly in the music industry that fans may not know he was once a mechanical engineering major at the University of Pennsylvania before dropping out to pursue music full-time.
After dropping out of college, he played in bands and learned more about the music industry, himself and his own sound. During that time, he was also finding and developing his own songwriting voice and production style.  
When choosing between engineering and music, Glantz said he asked himself, “What’s going to give me the most fulfillment? What’s going to make me the happiest?” 
His answer: music. He knew that only music would give him that freedom to be his own person and express himself however he wanted. 
Glantz has found becoming a solo artist to be a double-edged sword as the highs are higher and the lows are lower. His accomplishments are fully his, but, on the flip side, when it’s not going so well or not as he had hoped, that’s also on him. 
“When you’re in a band, it’s a little bit more comfortable because you have that diffusion of responsibility,” he said. 
Even though Glantz only started putting out his own music around two years ago, he has been playing the guitar since he was eight. From a young age, he aspired to “shred like Eddie Van Halen” on guitar, but also realized his passion for songwriting. 
He started writing songs at the age of 12 and credits his parents for always supporting him in his musical endeavors. 
“I would play three-hour bar gigs by myself when I was 17 and they would have to accompany me to them ‘cause I wasn’t 21 yet,” Glantz said. “They were just so supportive and never made it feel like it was impossible.” 
Glantz also explained the significance behind the number 23 in his artist name, breaking it down into three main reasons. 
He was born on the 23rd. He grew up in Chicago and played basketball (Michael Jordan’s jersey number was 23 when he played for the Chicago Bulls). Lastly, he started writing music for his solo career at the age of 23. 
His singles “IDK You Yet,” “Caught in the Middle,” “Brainstorm,” “Nothing’s the Same” and “Cry Over Boys” were all written, recorded and released during the pandemic. 
The young musician also divulged his struggles with songwriting when the pandemic started. 
“It’s kind of ironic because I usually write by myself in my house … for some reason, once that was the only way I could do it, it got immensely harder.” 
Because of the coronavirus and tours being on hold, Glantz acknowledged how much touring would serve as a break from writing,  giving him new experiences and a chance to reset his perspective. 
Despite that, he welcomed this time as a time for growth and experimentation, to find his next wave of sound.  
The way this EP came about was “almost like an accident,” Glantz said. The 26-year-old hadn’t planned on writing an EP, but as he kept writing throughout the past year, it was clear to him that the songs he’d written belonged together. 
These songs as a body of work chronicle “the lifespan of a relationship — from yearning for someone, to finding someone, to there being some turmoil, to it maybe not working out, to trying to recover, and then, to finally moving on.”
Glantz describes “Oh No, Not Again!” as “sad, but hopeful.” Though he’s generally a happy person, all his songs are sad. He expands on this by saying that when he feels happy, he lives with that feeling, but when he’s sad, he has to work through those feelings.  
Through the EP, he wants people to feel reassured that they are not alone: “I want people to listen and hear another human that is just going through very similar stuff to them.” 
Alexander 23 carefully crafts his music to express universal, sorrowful feelings that sound so beautiful listeners may forget the lyrics are sad. With the songs that are already out and how painfully relatable they are, “Oh No, Not Again!” is set to make people cry, but in a necessary, cathartic way. 
“Oh No, Not Again!” drops Feb. 19 on all platforms.

In an area northeast of USC’s Health Sciences campus, there are about 22,000 trees. Each tree has been identified by species and size by members of the USC Urban Trees Initiative. 
The USC Urban Trees Initiative has remotely recorded and analyzed a 3.5-square-mile zone block-by-block to provide data that could advise the Los Angeles community on where to plant and maintain trees to maximize benefits. 
“The heart of this project is really providing valuable data that the city and other community groups can use to successfully plant trees,” said Kate Weber, executive director of the public exchange and founder of the project. “We’re developing a scientific roadmap that ideally makes the city’s urban forestry efforts in this area more effective.”
A collaboration between the Dornsife Public Exchange, Dornsife Spatial Sciences Institute, Dornsife Carbon Census Network and the Landscape Architecture Program at the USC School of Architecture, the initiative started in the Fall semester, aiming to provide relief from rising temperatures and the onset of global warming in L.A. 
“What we’re interested in is trying to understand design options that would produce the best results in terms of reducing air pollution or improving stormwater recharge, or helping people handle extreme heat events,” said John Wilson, founding director of the Spatial Sciences Institute and project research lead. “Generally we rely on the idea that the more trees you have, the more influence you’re going to take out of the atmosphere and that may be true, but if you want to maximize the benefits of a certain kind of level of effort, then there’s some fundamental science that people haven’t done yet.”
Trees can have a significant impact on temperatures, especially in the L.A. community, where many houses were built during the 1940s and 1950s and are therefore lacking air conditioning. Finding the ideal spots to plant trees will provide the community with a resolution to combat the record-breaking temperatures in L.A. this past summer, according to Wilson.
The shade from trees affects the temperature and is also  useful for pedestrians during times of extreme heat.
“Some of our colleagues went out with handheld thermometers and measured the temperature on the sidewalk,” Wilson said. “[The] difference in temperature just a few minutes apart in shade and out of shade was about 20 or 30 degrees Fahrenheit.” 
By creating a scientific roadmap that advises the city of which species of trees to plant, where to plant them and how to maintain them, the project hopes to put the environmental relief plan to action. 
“We had some community meetings and community members are saying, ‘Well, USC, where are you going to plant the trees?’ and it’s like ‘No, we’re not planting the trees.’ Our job is not to tell the city where to plant the trees,” said David Galaviz, associate vice president for government and community relations at USC’s Office of Governmental Relations.
Instead, Galaviz said the project’s job is to “work with the city to make sure that the planning of the trees is more efficient, and it’s more beneficial.”
Furthermore, Galaviz works to ensure that USC and the community are on the same page about how planting trees can help their neighborhood.
“What we hope to get out of this project and what we think we’re real close to achieving is a shared vision — a shared vision between the University and our students, which are critical players, a shared vision with our community members and our elected officials,” Galaviz said. 
To achieve a shared vision, the project has been in contact with many groups  who have different perspectives to provide insight on what more could be done. 
“We had a series of virtual meetings with nonprofits, city council representatives and residents, where we talked about a variety of issues but got great input from the community on trees and needs in the area,” Weber said. 
The eight staff members and four undergraduate students involved with the project worked closely with the community to gather the data to drive policymaking. The Spatial Sciences Institute students presented their work to city representatives in meetings and received feedback from the City’s Forest Officer. 
So far, project members have built a base map for the study area, with public roadways, land use and knowledge of each block. The team has also gathered data on how many people live in the study area and their demographics, such as age cohorts and employment. 
In addition, researchers studied the 22,000 trees in the area through advanced mapping technology such as Google Street View. Other earth sciences experts also utilized small portable sensors for air quality measurements to see what happened to air pollution, carbon monoxide and other conditions related to the environment, close to or far away from freeways around certain species of trees so they could learn more about which trees will provide the best benefits for the city.
“I think those kinds of experiences for the students [are] the icing on the cake, because they get to see a project from its inception to its finish in almost every aspect,” said Wilson.
The project expects to finish their research by the end of March and announce findings in April. 
The city of L.A. is an international leader on sustainable economic development and on sustainable community building, according to Galaviz. USC’s involvement in this project allows L.A. to move forward with their Green New Deal plan which started in 2019. 
“USC is front and center in the city’s push to become more sustainable and more forward thinking,” Galaviz said. “This project is really an example of how USC academic research can really illuminate city policy and really create benefits. And a key component of that is our students, because they’re front and center, doing the research, pushing this forward.”

The School of Cinematic Arts held a live Zoom screening of “MLK/FBI” Wednesday, the first film to uncover the extent of the FBI’s surveillance and harassment of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The recipient of rave reviews and praised for its timeliness and cultural relevance, “MLK/FBI” dissects the escalating tensions between the two titular parties throughout King’s career. 
The evening started with an announcement by Victoria Renee, co-president of USC’s African American Cinema Society (AACS) about an upcoming event, and then moved into the live screening. The screening was followed by a Q&A with “MLK/FBI” director Sam Pollard and moderated by Nana Adwoa Frimpong, a graduate student studying film and television production.
The film’s trailer opens on a shot of the unmistakable 27-year-old Baptist minister from Alabama saying, “He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.”
Using newly discovered and declassified files,  the documentary explores King was at the time considered by the FBI to be the greatest threat to the internal security of the United States.
The documentary features interviews with two of King’s confidants, Andrew Young and Clarence Jones, as well as former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI investigator Charles Knox. It also interviews three historians who wrote about King’s relationship to the FBI and other figures in the counterintelligence community such as David Garrow, Beverly Gage and Donna Murch.
“MLK/FBI” takes a nuanced look at the iconic figure of King throughout his career as a pastor to his time as a renowned public figure up until his assassination in 1968. The film looks at King’s life through the lens of the largest law enforcement agency in the nation and provides an analysis of the FBI’s relationship with King, namely with then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.
“It’s really a parallel story,” Pollard said. “It’s a story about the ascendency of King and all he had to confront. At the same time, the FBI saw him as this Black messiah who was going to undermine American society, and [the film looks at] the methods they were going to go through to try to destroy his reputation.” 
Initially, Hoover’s logic was that King had connections to the Communist Party, which held ties to the Soviet Union, which the FBI used as a basis to launch covert operations against King for espionage reasons. The suspicions of King’s association with communism quickly evolved when FBI wiretaps suggested evidence of King’s non-monogamous sexual relations. Through wiretapping and bugging, the FBI built a case for King’s immorality without the approval or authority of anyone outside the FBI.
As Pollard reveals in the Q&A, the documentary idea came to producer Ben Hedin from historian David Garrow’s book, “The FBI and Martin Luther King, Jr.: From ‘Solo’ to Memphis.” Pollard said he saw the film as an opportunity to “dig into the complexities of King’s life but also [to] demythologize the FBI.”
Making use of the Freedom of Information Act and the National Archives, as well as revelatory restored footage, the film “explores the government’s history of targeting Black activists and the contested meaning behind some of our most cherished ideals.”
From one of King’s first live broadcasts in 1956 to his great “I Have A Dream” speech in 1963, “MLK/FBI” shows the behind-the-scenes turmoil the FBI created through the gradual, constant surveillance of King. On the other hand, the film also unpacks the FBI’s clandestine agenda against King during a time when the public opinion of King was still divided.
In the Q&A, Pollard said that it surprised him to see a 1964 poll with approval ratings that were higher for Hoover than for King.
“Hoover wasn’t an outlier, he was [speaking] to what the mainstream media thought about King,” Pollard said, regarding public perceptions of King as overly radical.
Stylistically, Pollard chose to record all of the interviews on tape and off camera, purposely excluding the talking heads of interview subjects. This was inspired by the stylings of the film “The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975” (Göran Olsson), allowing the audience to zone in on what the subjects are saying as they narrate the film. 
These interviews develop the notion of King as a man rather than an icon and examine the character of King through his highs and his lows, Pollard said.
“In the last five to six years, I’m looking at people who I have a tremendous amount of respect for, but I’m looking for the chinks in the armor. You can’t tell stories like this without doing that,” he said.
By exposing details of his private life, the FBI hoped to undermine MLK and weaken his image as a leader. 
“He was looked at as somebody who was undermining the notion of American democracy,” Murch says in the film. 
Pollard advises young filmmakers to challenge their own perspectives.
“Don’t make films [where] you’re going to say ‘I’m talking to the left or I’m talking to the right.,’” he said. “Make films that challenge people’s perceptions of everything that we’ve gone through in the last months. Make films that lead to discussion and debate.”
When asked if there are any changes he would make to the film given the new momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement in the media, Pollard responded, “No. Because when you watch this film, it’s like looking in a two-way mirror. It’s America today. It’s amazing. Sad and amazing.”

If you are not an avid watcher of the television series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” which stars Tracy Lauren Marrow — formally known as Ice-T — then it has likely been a while since you’ve heard of the rapper. This is not because he is not worthy of discussion, in fact, he is quite the opposite. 
Still, as Ice-T’s 63rd birthday was celebrated during the livestream Q&A held by Visions and Voices on Feb. 16, it is clear that this artist became a legend far before current USC students were born.
The boundless talent, experience and wisdom of Ice-T cannot be understated. Having sold around 10 million records, Ice-T exemplifies the rhythmic magnetism and profound nature of rap. The journey he traveled during his wildly successful career is a staple in Los Angeles history and the USC community had the honor to hear his story firsthand.
For a generation that more often than not feels removed from older generations, this conversation was evidence that being open to the stories of those who have walked the earth a lot longer than we have can be incredibly rewarding. 
Moderated by the Gould School of Law Professor Jody Armour, the two men spoke about LA hip-hop, the corrupt American prison system and much else in between. 
Executive director of Visions and Voices DariaYudacufski started the evening by interrupting the very active and excited participant chat box. She thanked Armour for moderating the discussion and extended credit to their co-sponsors The Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, the Black Student Assembly, Brothers Breaking Bread and La Casa for helping create the event. 
She then thanked and introduced Ice-T after a short summary of his career. Yudacufski touched lightly on Ice-T’s childhood hardships, but mainly highlighted his reputation as an example of “turning obstacles into opportunities.” 
Already, the audience could tell that this would be more than just a conversation about music and television. It was when Armour virtually took the microphone that the Band-Aid was ripped off and the gritty themes shone through, simply yet vividly stated as “race, rap and the possibility of redemption.” 
After Ice-T’s parents both died of heart attacks before he finished middle school, he was sent to live with his aunt in downtown LA. From there, his life became overrun with gang mentalities and a merciless environment. Surrounded by friends who were hypnotized into a toxic mentality, he was “poisoned by that train of thought” or, as he quotes Iceberg Slim, “street poisoned.” 
At that time, Ice-T was committing numerous felonies a day, and this was not because he was inherently immoral with intentions of causing harm, but because he had no other choice and no hope for anything better. 
“Poverty is a dangerous place to be,” Ice-T said. “I don’t care if it’s white poverty, Black poverty, when people don’t have hope they’re making bad decisions.”
The two then tackled the question: If Ice-T did not live long enough to escape this oppressive system and achieve a sustainable living, if Ice-T found himself with a life-long prison sentence instead, how would the general public view him then? Would he still have a Zoom chat full of idolizing fans or would he have a jury justifying his sentence to a cell forever? 
“People call me a role model,” Ice-T said. “I’m like, ‘Yeah, I transformed into a role model. But in one of my rhymes, I say ‘I’m not your role model, my road’s too dirty to follow. Try to model yourself after the new Ice-T, not the old Ice-T,” he laughed. “He was trying to find himself.”
Ice-T was one of the first rappers to talk about the horrors of life within the prison system. In “The Tower,” which was released in 1991, Ice-T brings to life this taboo reality, speaking as a person learning about the obscurely complex institution from behind the cell walls.
“They call me a lifer, cause I’m good as dead / I live in the hole, so the floor’s my bed / And I ask myself again / Who has the power / The Whites? The Blacks? / Or just the gun tower?”
“There is the ability for people to redeem themselves and change their ways,” Ice-T said. 
Especially when, as Armour pointed out, “Over the last 10-20 years, they found that a lot of our brains aren’t really fully developed even until we’re 25, and so we’ve been locking kids up for life without parole for things they’ve been doing at 14 and 13 and 15.” 
The adult that Ice-T grew into that we now know and love was ultimately shaped by the struggles he endured as a teenager, which also influenced his hip-hop career. Many of his lyrics recount the violent lifestyle he was forced to live, such as the song “Cop Killer,” which tells the story of an imaginary character who is so fed up with police brutality that he becomes the aggressor himself. 
Armour brought up the issue of rap lyrics being introduced as incriminating material in court. 
“You got to be aware of everything you do and how it paints the picture of you,” Ice-T said. 
He reflected that the legal system will find ways to include seemingly irrelevant personal details into the court of law, including threatening rap lyrics. After playing Fin Tutuola, a New York Police Departmentsergeant, for 20 years on “Law & Order: SVU” which televises a fictional courtroom hundreds of times, he is substantially familiar with the court system.
“Real gangsta rap is apolitical,” Ice-T said. “It’s negative because that’s the mindset of the person. He’s negative. So when you’re listening to rappers that are 17, 18 years old, they don’t have knowledge yet. They don’t have the ability to know what’s right or wrong.” 
In this statement, Ice-T’s extensive experience and maturity with rap is extremely valuable, a topic that is so unfamiliar to most adults. The legal system is not, however, full of professionals who share this particular insight. “Stay out of court,” he seriously joked.
Armour then bridged the conversation into the flip-side of the coin and commented on the egregious dialogue of the Los Angeles Police Department, which is much less debated than the words of Black rappers. 
On Valentine’s Day, an image of George Floyd was circulated by and throughout the police department with the caption, “you take my breath away.” Remember the circumstances surrounding Floyd’s death? Because the LAPD evidently did. 
Words are powerful, whether they are used for good or for evil. Ice-T used his words to “put some wisdom into the game,” and “put some knowledge in [rap] versus just the wildness of it,” he said. 
At the same time, words cannot be used as a cop-out for real progress, especially among white people during the Black Lives Matter movement. 
“See, this is where I got hope,” Ice-T said. “When I saw these last protests, they were so diverse. There was so many different people, races, religions, everyone was out there together. So these people can’t just do that BLM shit, they gotta live it, and they gotta come back and say ‘you know what? I’m gonna make a change.’” 
Fortunately, as he stands today to demonstrate, change can occur. Young activists can learn from his passionate sincerity and his patience to continue holding hope during painful times. 
Sadly, they will still never be as fly as Ice-T.

Hundreds of previously developed and brightly colored disposable cameras piled up in a transparent bin inside of Quik-Pix Photo Lab tell a story of USC and the surrounding community. The store’s owner, Akm Alam, has a unique connection with the student population, having developed thousands of student photos for the past few decades.
As of Feb. 17, Alam’s business, which is located a few blocks from campus on Vermont Avenue, has served the local community for exactly forty years. Mason Robinson, a senior majoring in communications who frequents the store, said that Alam is “just one of those few people that you can go to his store and [he] knows your name and he’s happy to see you.”
While Alam’s kind-heartedness has always been a staple, his business has faced difficulties over the past few years. Quik-Pix was one of many businesses forced to relocate when the USC Village was constructed in 2014, according to Alam. The coronavirus pandemic and its effect on the student population due to remote learning has also caused Quik-Pix to suffer from a lack of business. In addition, Alam has dealt with his fair share of personal struggles. Within the past year, he was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, which defines the group of diseases that reside in the same family as ALS.
While Robinson had been using Quik-Pix’s film development services since his freshman year, he only began his relationship with Alam this summer, when Robinson helped Alam out from time to time in the store. This was when the pair “got to really know each other,” Robinson said. It was only within the past few months that Alam told Robinson and another senior, Biata Shem-Tov, about his struggles. Robinson said the exchange was very emotional and left him “pretty much speechless”.
After this exchange, Robinson, with help from Shem-Tov, decided to extend a helping hand and create a GoFundMe page that would serve as a fundraiser for Alam. 
“He could definitely appreciate a little sign of support, even if it was just a gift or whatnot, but just knowing that people care and that people don’t just mindlessly walk into the store or view him as just a random part of their lives,” Robinson said.
A GoFundMe page spread across social media quickly as students began sharing the story amongst each other. 
Many students were happy to help, given that those who have used one of Quik-Pix’s many services seem to have a story about the kindness and professionalism of Alam. Sipporah Negash, a senior majoring in chemical engineering, described the first time she met Alam. 
“He was really kind, and we got to chat a bit about our backgrounds and stuff, and he just seemed genuinely interested in talking with me and getting to know more about me,” Negash said. “It was also really great to be able to put a face to the name.”
Alam even went out of his way to give Negash a tutorial on how to better use her camera, she said.
Kiana Naderi, a senior majoring in business administration, described Alam’s warmth as contagious.  
“I couldn’t believe how somebody could have such a smile on their face every single day, despite going through so much hardship, so I knew I had to share it and send it around on group chats, share it on all my social media, try to help him as much as possible,” Naderi said.
Just this past week, the GoFundMe page hit its goal, raising over $3,000, just shy of 100 donors at the time of publication. This is in addition to the $2,000 raised in an earlier GoFundMe campaign that aimed to help Alam during coronavirus lockdowns this summer, organized by alum Lauren Torres.
The funds raised will be gifted to Alam, to be used at his discretion for medical bills, financial support for Quik-Pix, or otherwise, Robinson said. Most importantly, Robinson said, is that the fundraiser will alleviate some of Alam’s financial worries and share the message that he isn’t alone.
And the message got across. On Quik-Pix’s 40th anniversary, Robinson and Shem-Tov surprised Alam with the support he’d received through the GoFundMe page. After hearing the news, Alam was overwhelmed with happiness, saying that he would be grateful for the rest of his life. 
“Knowing that I have some money, mentally I’m at peace a little bit,” Alam expressed.
Alam said he loves being able to interact with students, and they feel the same about him.
“I just feel like they’re my kids, [like] they’re my children,” Alam said.

With only three games left in the regular season for the Trojans, they have their eyes set on a critical doubleheader this weekend at Galen Center. The Trojans will start the pair of games with Oregon State on Friday, followed by No. 13 Oregon Sunday. The Trojans are fifth in the Pac-12 standings, sitting at 10-8 overall and 8-7 in the conference. Oregon State finds themselves at 6-6 overall and 4-6 in the conference as they are ninth in the conference. 
Having split a pair of games last weekend with a 56-66 loss against Colorado and a redemption win against Utah, USC looks to start its home stand strong against the Beavers. 
The Trojans missed their first opportunity to showcase their talent against the Beavers in the season opener in January when the matchup was postponed indefinitely due to coronavirus protocols.  
Now, the Trojans are starting to find their rhythm as key players such as redshirt-sophomore guard Shalexxus Aaron, sophomore guard Endyia Rogers and sophomore forward Alissa Pili start to emerge into the spotlight.
Aaron was on a hot streak in her previous game against Utah, scoring 10 straight points to end the game with 16. Rogers recorded 17 points and Pili dominated the paint even though her box score only showed eight points. 
Sophomore guard Alyson Miura contributed with 10 points to help the Trojans secure their win against the Utes. Head coach Mark Trakh understands that USC can’t start slow against OSU because of the Beavers’ ability to shoot the ball and score in bunches. OSU’s height advantage in the paint can also pose problems for the Trojans. 
“We have to defend them,” Trakh said. “Everyone on Oregon State can shoot, everyone’s got deep range. So we got to push up on them. We have to close out on the shooters because that’s their strength. And they got a great post player that’s about 6’4” who can really score around the basket, so you really can’t leave any of the shooters to double to her. So the whole thing will be guarding the post and going out on the three-point shooters.” 
The Beavers are coming off a blowout loss against Stanford last week. Freshman guard Sasha Goforth led the team in the game with 16 points. This season’s top scorer for OSU, senior guard Aleah Goodman, contributed 12 points of her own while the team’s leading rebounder sophomore forward Taylor Jones chipped in with 13 points and 15 rebounds. 
Trakh gave high praise to his own team’s firepower — for the first time in program history, three different players have been awarded conference Player of the Week: Pili, Rogers and Sanders. 
Understanding that no one key individual is solely responsible for the Trojans’ success allows USC to function as a complete team every game.
“We basically do it by committee … First time in USC women’s basketball history that we’ve had three different Pac-12 women’s players of the week,” Trakh said. “So with Jordan Sanders, Endyia Rogers and Alissa Pili. So we don’t rely on one person, you know we just see who’s hot for any one game but we generally do that by committee.” 
With the NCAA tournament knocking on the door for both teams, the Trojans have to finish out the season with matchups against three quality opponents to improve their chances of qualifying. The Trojans hope to keep everyone available for the stretch run, as their biggest enemy this season has seemingly been injuries. 
“We’re a young team that is getting better. I think we won eight out of our last 10 games,” Trakh said. “So I would like to see us compete. You know we are on the bubble as far as NCAA tournament bid which is great considering that we started the year with seven players and only five in conference and now we’re on the bubble. The first four out of the NCAA tournament and we finish with Oregon State and Oregon and UCLA, three quality opponents. So we got a great chance to make a case for the NCAA tournament going into the last three games of the season.” 
The Trojans are 44-29 all-time against Oregon State, starting in the 1967-77 season. Last season at home USC beat the then No. 11 ranked Beavers 72-66. Tip-off is at 2:30 p.m. Friday.

“Injury-prone” has been thrown around countless times to describe superstar Lakers forward Anthony Davis. The 6-foot-10-inch big man has been sidelined in a whopping 123 regular season games throughout his nine-year career, a number that continues to rise after Davis was ruled out of games through the All-Star Break on Mar. 7. He suffered a calf strain and a re-aggravation of the right Achilles tendonosis against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. 
Lakers fans have become all too familiar with seeing their 190 million dollar man crumble to the floor or break out into a limp mid-game. In the NBA bubble in Orlando, Davis had multiple injury scares against the Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets, and even in the Finals against the Miami Heat, sending Lakers Nation into a frenzy when their championship hopes were on the line. 
Davis, despite being banged up, anchored the Lakers on both ends of the floor to bring the organization their 17th championship. Playing through multiple injuries, the superstar averaged 26.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game in 28 games in the bubble. 
It was in dominant fashion in which Davis put up those numbers, especially from mid-range, where he transformed his game by going from a 37% mid-range shooter in the regular season to 49% in the playoffs. The degree of difficulty on some of his step-back mid-range buckets was so jaw-dropping it almost felt Kevin Durant-esque — as the defender, you just have to tip your hat to the 6-foot-10-inch sniper because there’s nothing you can do to disrupt his rhythm. 
Davis’ unreal performance in the bubble seemed to hint at an upcoming surge from one of the league’s most talented players. Coming off his first championship at age 27, Davis was set to enter the prime years of his career, similar to LeBron James winning his first championship with the Miami Heat at age 27 in 2012. 
James sustained that high level of play to add another three rings to his resume, and it seemed as though Davis was on a similar trajectory, ready to take the reins of the Los Angeles Lakers franchise from the aging LeBron James. 
Now 29 games into the NBA season, it has been quite the contrary. Coming off a shortened offseason, James has yet to miss a game and is playing at an MVP-level while his counterpart, Davis, is down in all major numerical categories compared to his first season with the Lakers. 
His exceptional bubble shooting hasn’t translated to the new season, connecting on 42.5% from the midrange and a career low 29.3% from beyond the arc since he became a legitimate shooting threat. Anthony Davis just hasn’t looked like the Anthony Davis we were expecting to see. He has looked sluggish, sometimes disengaged, and simply not as effective or assertive as we have grown accustomed to from the Lakers superstar. But most of all, he hasn’t looked healthy. 
Davis’ latest injury, a re-aggravation of his right Achilles tendonosis, is a product of the shortened offseason. 
“Usually when the season is over, I’d take a month or a month-and-a-half off to let the body heal and then get back into training and build up,” Davis explained to media personnel. 
With just two months between seasons, Davis never got the extended period of time he needed to rid himself of any nagging injuries and work back up to shape. Now, Davis has that opportunity. 
The Lakers, sitting at the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference with a 22-7 record, have no reason to rush Davis back into the lineup. While he is slated to return after the All-Star break in three weeks, it will only prove beneficial to hold him out for as much time as possible.
Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka made a plethora of offseason moves to add a dynamic attack to the Lakers offense, while maintaining the best defensive rating in the league. The Lakers depth will now shine bright; guys have the chance to step up and prove themselves in the absence of a ball-dominant player like Davis. 
Forward Montrezl Harrell can provide energy and offense with Davis unavailable, point guard Dennis Schroeder can steady the ship and keep defenses on their heels, and the emergence of 20 year-old guard Talen Horton-Tucker will provide a needed spark off the bench. Not to mention, that guy wearing No. 23 in the purple and gold, LeBron James — he’s pretty good at basketball too. 
For the Lakers, health is of the utmost importance. We know what they are capable of; we saw it last season. But, to capture that elusive 18th championship, they are going to need a healthy Anthony Davis to survive on the road to repeat.

USC women’s volleyball lost another five set heartbreaker Sunday in Salt Lake City. The Utes, who are ranked first in conference play and seventh nationally, handed the Trojans their fourth straight defeat. The team has been struggling to close out games as three of its past four matches have gone to five sets. 
On Sunday, the Trojans lost by scores of 24-26, 25-19, 25-18, 24-26 and 15-13. USC will now look to break its losing streak Friday when they face the Cal Golden Bears at Haas Pavilion in Berkeley.
The Golden Bears have had a rough start to their season as well, having lost seven of their first eight games. Their only win came against Stanford, a team that USC has yet to play due to coronavirus cancellations. 
Katrina Pantovic, a freshman outside hitter for the Golden Bears, leads the team in kills. For the Trojans, senior outside hitter Brooke Botkin and sophomore outside hitter Emilia Weske are looking to continue their impressive seasons. In their last match against Utah, Botkin had 21 kills, 12 digs and 4 blocks to complete her fifth straight double-double. Weske had 13 kills and 4 blocks. 
USC head coach Brad Keller hopes the team can improve its play as the season goes on.
“Every single weekend we have together we’re learning a lot about one another — how to communicate, how to create relationships, and all of those small little things that are so vital that we haven’t been able to do because of COVID,” Keller said. “To catch up with communication and one-on-ones and to actually be around each other is super helpful for us, especially on the road because there’s a lot of dead pockets of time.” 
For this weekend’s games against Cal, Keller hopes the team improves its decision making in high-pressure situations.
“It’s going to come down to the details. This team knows that — we’re not great on details,” Keller said. “We’ve got to get better at passing the ball on first touch and second touch. We have to get better at late matches and how to handle those stressful situations. The more that we’re in those scenarios, the better off we are going to be.” 
Coming off a rough patch, Keller explained why the Trojans were so short-handed against the Utes. In USC’s first match against Utah, Keller and company were without eight of their players due to disciplinary actions and injuries. Because of this, Keller made zero substitutions for the entire match. 
“Obviously the first night was a different lineup. We had a violation of team standards,” Keller said. “Here at USC, you get what you tolerate, and we’re just not going to tolerate anything but the very best.”
Despite missing key players, Keller was impressed with the performance of the players who contributed on short notice. 
“Both matches I thought we competed,” Keller said. “For a lineup they had to learn all these new things within two days … they competed. They were given kind of an unfair hand and they dealt with it […] I thought there were a lot of positives to what they did.”
USC will face Cal Friday at 7 p.m., and Saturday at 3 p.m.

The coronavirus has been a pressing issue around the world and in the United States  for almost a year now, during which there have been numerous instances of tragedy striking the most vulnerable communities including low income class, immigrant and Black and Indigenous people and people of color. Not only are these communities the most at risk of exposure and dying from the coronavirus, they are also more at risk of unemployment. 
Prior to the pandemic, migrant workers were more employed than native U.S. workers, but the drastic change in the state of the economy hit immigrant workers the most. The number of unemployed workers fell by about 24 million at the beginning of 2020. Immigrants made up most of those job cuts — the decline in their employment rates reaching 19% according to the PEW Research Center. Other marginalized groups have faced higher unemployment rates during the pandemic, with Latinx women being the most affected, facing a 21% employment decline.
The reason immigrant, specifically undocumented immigrant communities, are the most vunerable to unemployment traces back to a history of discimination against them. 
Historically, undocumented immigrants have fought for rights in the workplace considering this community faces the most exploitation. Cases of immigrant exploitation include the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and Great Depression migrant worker conditions on the West Coast. Although immigrant workers gained rights through the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, some workspaces opt to not enforce labor laws, and since unemployed workers may fear being fired or deported, they often do not speak up about unfair treatment in their workspace. 
During the pandemic specifically, undocumented workers may have restrictions in regards to their access of public benefits and social safety nets, thus making it easier for companies to fire their immigrant workers with no real need to provide great unemployment benefits.
Although many immigrant workers and allies have also taken this time to speak up about this issue in other workspaces, USC’s issue of unemployment and layoffs remains out of the media. Although the Instagram account @USCscale has gained traction among students and has dedicated their work to raising awareness, the layoff issue remains unrecognized by any media source outside of the account.
According to the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation at USC, USC transportation, hospitality and housing workers received an email announcement  in December of layoffs and furloughs that were going to happen on December 31st. SCALE also pointed out that most of these workers are Black and brown community members who are already at a higher risk of being impacted by the coronavirus. On top of possibly losing a stable course of income, these workers also risked losing healthcare benefits. Even if they were hired again later on, they would start off with a “clean slate,” which means none of their previous employment benefits would remain intact. 
Immigrant workers laid off during the pandemic may seem like a problem outside of the proximity of USC; indeed, that is certainly what is suggested by the lack of awareness the community has about what’s going on. 
But, this is not the case. USC is not an exception of targeting an already vulnerable community and being complicit in worsening their financial situation.
Immigrant communities and the Black and brown community members make up an important part of USC and are essential to the success of the University. Not only does USC as a whole need to become more aware of the problem, but it must also demand the protections of these workers.

The complexities of being Asian in the United States have increased exponentially since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. There is a permeating aggression and desire for retribution that envelopes the label. 
I have never been more proud and yet more heartbroken to call myself a part of the body of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) braving its way through the Western world. There has been a great acceptance of who we are, but it has come at a time of great sorrow for many being used as a tool for misdirected vengeance. 
I have been raised by and am a part of a vibrant Asian American community that is unarguably invaluable to the University, to Southern California and to the entire nation. 
In my upbringing, the tenets of diligence, humility and the acceptance of a harder path were ingrained in me. There is a great unspoken acceptance of the “model minority” helm that is placed upon us, and for fear of breaking from the fold, the majority of Asian Americans take it up, albeit with a grain of salt. 
The “model minority” notion has become a conceptual tool used in tangible AAPI oppression. My parents and their parents were led to believe that if they worked hard enough or if they assimilated more completely, they might one day have a seat at the table. This catch-22 promises that we, as a demographic, may have a greater chance at opportunity where other minorities may not, but like a mirage in the distance, there is no substance to what has been promised. 
The issue of standing complicit to the acts of aggression carried out by this nation has become an issue of contention within the AAPI community. 
Asian Americans, old and young, have been trained not to come to the aid of others, even our own. We are encouraged to turn a blind eye. Most starkly, it has been suggested to us from birth that we should be grateful for the sliver of equal opportunity that has been afforded to us on account of our cooperation. 
I would liken it to playing the lottery; you have a chance to win, however small, as long as you follow all of the rules.
As it is, there is no place for our own self-acceptance in this lottery. The powers in this country have set whiteness on a pedestal and encouraged us to be something we may never be, and yet, because of our love for this nation and our desire to succeed, we try.
Our hearts reside with the family of Vicha Ratanapakdee, and we condemn the attack on the 91-year-old man in Oakland and on Noel Quintana, a Filipino man slashed across the face on a New York subway car. 
These grave acts of aggression are accompanied by smaller microaggressions that Asian Americans have faced on a daily basis since the outbreak of the pandemic. 
Since the pandemic’s outbreak, there have been upwards of 2,500 cases of anti-Asian hate crimes according to Stop AAPI Hate, a group dedicated to tracking such incidents. The New York Police Department reported a 1,900% increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020. 
The aggressors, no matter the scale of the attack, have dangerously manipulated a global pandemic to use as an excuse to harm those already struggling. In no way are we to blame for this global crisis, but our businesses, our people and our culture are shouldering the burdens of a xenophobia that continues to build. 
For those of AAPI descent or those who are allies to our community, in the defense of Asian American lives, we should not be permissive of the hate crimes and hate speech that have been condoned by past leaders or enduring cultural biases. 
Asian Americans are not the source of an outbreak. They are not the place to find and take justice. They are the life-force with which this country has been able to push forward in a world of unprecedented happenstances. 
They are hard-working Americans — loving grandparents, parents and children — and because that doesn’t seem to be convincing for some, they are first and foremost human beings who do not deserve the xenophobic rhetoric and malice-filled attacks that have been rationalized as nationalism. 
Through that lens, my heart and my efforts for justice reside with my community — as they do with other communities facing racial and socioeconomic battles alongside this health crisis. 
The past year has been a true battle for change in the way this nation treats and views its marginalized peoples. 
In the past year, former president Donald Trump referred very memorably to the coronavirus not by its medical abbreviation but by a string of racist monikers that fanned the flames of xenophobia nationwide. 
The use of that language was recently prohibited by the Biden administration, but not before it had already entered the vocabulary of the indecent and malice-filled citizen. The power of these words and phrases have made themselves known and our communities have been assaulted in more ways than one.
The fact that we are Asian and Pacific Islander does not take away from the value of our work or the lengths we have gone to aid the nation we call home in its battle against a nationwide crisis. 
Our race most certainly does not take away the value of our lives, and the AAPI community is not the place to mislay acts of aggression in the name of an unfounded justice. 
The prohibition of xenophobic language is a start, but stopping these incidents involves a much broader group of people. It involves individuals and requires change within communities, within the AAPI community as well. 
The prevalence of racism in this country has made it undeniable that a pandemic existed long before the coronavirus was discovered. The fight against hate and systems of inequality present themselves as the reigning battle in America, and the deconstruction of these systems truly begins with the individual. 
For others who identify with the AAPI community, I have such great faith that we are turning a new leaf. I know the difficulty of unraveling these lifelong practices and the shame with which we have approached our Asianness for far too long. We must continue to advocate for others and advocate for ourselves, too. There has never been a greater time to come together and work towards change.
