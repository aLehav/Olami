After Victor McElhaney, a jazz drummer and student at the Thornton School of Music, was killed last year near USC, faculty member Peter Erskine remembered something McElhaney’s mother said to him at a Thornton family event in 2017: “Victor wants to change the world.”
“When someone wants to change the world, to make it a better place, most often they don’t get to stick around to see the results … We were determined to try to help him realize that dream,” said Erskine, director of drumset studies at Thornton, who taught McElhaney privately for a year. “Victor did help change the world. He brought about dialogue, he brought about energy within the school of music … so we created this scholarship in his name.”
The Victor McElhaney Memorial Jazz Drumming Endowed Scholarship, announced by Thornton Wednesday, will be awarded to an undergraduate drummer who reflects the spirit and ideals McElhaney represented. The first recipient will be selected by the school’s jazz faculty for the upcoming academic year.
Aaron Serfaty, who privately instructed McElhaney and led the Afro-Latin American Jazz ensemble that McElhaney was in, said McElhaney was extremely passionate and constantly advocated for what he believed in — citing a rehearsal in which McElhaney sparked a two-hour discussion on issues of racial disparities and representation.
”I was very happy, very excited to hear that kind of conversation at USC, because in the 23 years I’ve been there we’ve had pretty much nothing in that line of conversation,” Serfaty said.
Serfaty is not part of the selection committee but said he hopes the recipient will honor McElhaney’s dedication toward social justice, which manifested itself in various corners of his life — from his work fostering a community of Black male leadership as co-director of Brothers Breaking B.R.E.A.D. (Barriers, Regrets, Egos, Animosity and Doubt) to the everyday conversations he sparked in class. Along with his close friend Syann Cromwell, he screened “Moonlight” at Ground Zero and opened up a discussion on identity and breaking down barriers. It was the first installment in a series called “Keep Me Grounded.”
“What I hope and what I would like to see is a student of African American origin that is very active in his or her community and has strong beliefs, just like Victor did,” Serfaty said. “We want activism, we want people determined to help change the world through music, which is what he wanted to do.”
McElhaney, who majored in jazz and drumset studies, was involved in the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, Brothers Breaking B.R.E.A.D. and various student combos. He was also a mentor to young musicians at the Oakland Public Conservatory of Music.
One of the combos McElhaney drummed and occasionally sang for was a rhythm section with solo singers, led by jazz vocalist Kathleen Grace. Grace worked with McElhaney for a year and said he was a “remarkable human.”
“He challenged you on things, but he would always do it out of such a sense of love and interest and enthusiasm. He had a lot of light,” Grace said. “I think Victor can help us all speak up more, and he’s someone I think about when I think about that for myself.”
In March 2019, a month before his 22nd birthday, McElhaney was killed by four people attempting a robbery while he was on his way to an art show. Soon after his death, the scholarship was kickstarted by Erskine, who auctioned off more than 100 signed cymbals from his 45-year collection. He said that all of his cymbals had a story to tell and noted if they were played on recordings or at special events. McElhaney’s classmates helped Erskine video demonstrate and photograph each of the cymbals, which he was then able to auction off online with the help of The Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood.
Other donations came in from Thornton Board of Councilors members, USC members of the Board of Trustees, McElhaney’s classmates and an anonymous donor. Erskine initially thought that the scholarship fund would last for five or 10 years, but once the anonymous donor got on board, the fund was large enough to become endowed. Erskine said McElhaney will be memorialized each year for the rest of Thornton history.
“What it does is attaches his name, his identity, and I think we could say that it attaches his soul to the search for musical discovery and musical truth that students, year after year, generation after generation, will be engaging in,” Erskine said. “He’s going to be very present for as long as we have a jazz studies program at the Thornton School of Music, which I hope will be forever.”
The jazz faculty at Thornton was not the only group of people who wanted to honor McElhaney. This past academic year, the USC Black Alumni Association awarded a scholarship to Thornton master’s student Yafeu Tyhimba in McElhaney’s name. CBCSA also included his image in a new wall mural displayed in the Student Union. 
McElhaney was the son of councilmember Lynette Gibson McElhaney and Clarence McElhaney of Oakland. His musical talent was present from an early age when he began drumming before he could even walk or talk, Lynette said according to a past Daily Trojan articleErskine described him as someone who had the touch of a seasoned jazz musician and was musically fearless. His talent was well acknowledged, but above all, as Grace said when reflecting on his memorial service, McElhaney was remembered for his constant actions of love. 
“We just need more people like him on this planet,” Serfaty said. “Not just musicians like him — but people.”

A few weeks ago, Nayanika Kapoor graduated from USC in an unprecedented virtual ceremony. Though the recent political science and journalism graduate was set to pursue a Fulbright Fellowship in Taiwan — an opportunity which has since been postponed until January 2021 because of the pandemic — Kapoor’s next step is just as exciting and uncertain: moving to Montana.
“I feel like I am going to a different world than the one I have been living in for the last three months,” she said. 
Kapoor is moving to Helena to join Montana Governor Steve Bullock’s campaign for the U.S. Senate — a campaign that has attracted national attention as a key race in the Democratic Party’s attempt to capture a Senate majority in November.
“I don’t think there is any other situation beside the campaign in which I could see myself moving somewhere completely new, on my own, with no one else that I know,” Kapoor said. “But from what I’ve talked with people about, that is the best part of the campaign — everyone is coming in new and fresh, and you immediately build these super strong relationships … It is definitely still nerve-wracking because you don’t know anyone.”
For Kapoor, the uncertainty of graduation was overwhelming, but she has always had her heart set on campaign work. During her time at USC, she worked multiple campaign finance internships and volunteered during election cycles as a phone banker and canvasser. However, she had never experienced full-time work on a campaign.
“What drew me to [this] campaign is hearing everyone talk about how once you’re in on a campaign, you build a community that is so strong,” said Kapoor, who will serve as a Bullock campaign finance assistant. “I think as someone who knows that I want to do politics long term, it felt like such good timing.” 
Kapoor is not alone in her decision, and her situation is not unlike many of her former classmates’. City, state and national campaign work is proving to be a new path that can make up for missed, lost or delayed opportunities amid a shaky job market. 
Kurtis Weatherford, another member of the Class of 2020 and a recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship to Greece, hopes to fill the gap between graduation and his fellowship start date by joining a local campaign. Weatherford’s fellowship, like Kapoor’s, has been postponed until January, but he is currently searching for opportunities to become politically involved in his home state of Missouri or in neighboring Kansas. 
Weatherford stressed that campaigns are more likely to utilize digital communication tools and technology in order to adhere to social distancing guidelines, strategies that he is familiar with based on past experience. 
“I did phone banking and text banking for the Warren campaign, and that’s an interesting way to feel like you’re doing something, and that leads into the reasons why I am so interested in doing campaign work now,” said Weatherford, a political economy and international relations graduate. “[It’s] doing something tangible to push the political contentions in this country in a way that is more powerful.”
Rohan Parepally is in a similar situation. The recent Marshall School of Business graduate was set to start at Bain & Company as an associate consultant in the fall — but he holds that having job assurance does not mean recent grads are in the clear. 
“Graduating into this kind of environment and economy right now is definitely a little bit stressful — I was fortunate enough to come out of this year with a job offer that I had accepted,” Parepally said. “I was anticipating my start date in September 2020, but two hours before my last final, I received a call about pushing back my start date because of the coronavirus situation … We are still figuring this out as students [and] as people.”
Before graduating, Parepally did not fully anticipate beginning the initial search into campaign opportunities. But, he believes that because 2020 is an election year, young people now have a unique opportunity to meaningfully spend the new time on their hands by becoming involved in the political process. Parepally has now returned home to Chicago and is still in the initial stages of looking into campaign opportunities in potential presidential election swing states such as Wisconsin.
“I’ve always kept track of politics as a side interest, but it’s never been at the forefront of what I wanted to study,” Parepally said. “But we are obviously graduating into a very unique time, not only in the economy but also historically … people have very strong opinions [about] the state of American politics and the opportunity to participate in that and have a hand in trying to achieve the outcome you want is uniquely important right now.”
While graduates continue to navigate new challenges and changes in the job market, campaign work during the pandemic will also look very different. Election season traditionally sees thousands of people mobilizing across the country in person, knocking on doors, attending rallies and shaking hands. But the pandemic is pushing campaigns to get creative and rethink their strategies. 
The uncertainty of campaigning during a pandemic extends to anxiety over the voting process in November. A recent report in Politico suggests that multiple scenarios outline a situation in which voters become disenfranchised because they are concerned for their health. Multiple reports also fear that a flood of mail-in ballots would significantly slow election results and that errors in shipping, receiving and counting ballots could taint the validity of the election.
Ben Pearce, a member of the Class of 2020 and former president of USC College Democrats, was a fellow with Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign in Iowa earlier this year. Through the Unruh Institute of Politics’ Inside Iowa Project, Pearce gained firsthand experience in local political organizing efforts long before the pandemic made headlines in the United States. 
“It’s hard to imagine [campaigning] in a COVID world because half of what I was doing was knocking on doors all the time,” said Pearce, a graduate of the Price School of Public Policy. “I don’t know what field organizing looks like in a world where we are stuck in our apartments — I think that is the greatest uncertainty of all this.”
Pearce was initially set to pursue a job opportunity starting in August, but a hiring freeze as a result of the coronavirus has now led him to search for short-term opportunities in campaign work.
“These elections matter immensely to the lives of everyone in this country — and that’s what gets me into it,” Pearce said. “I want to help make sure that I am pushing for good in this country.”
