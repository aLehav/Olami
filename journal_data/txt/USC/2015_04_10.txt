Recently, the weather in Tokyo has taken a turn for the worse. On Wednesday, there was snow slush in the streets. Thus the cherry blossoms, which are naturally short-lived, have suffered horribly and the streets are filled with brown and trampled petals. During the peak season, though, I luckily made it to Sensōji Temple, a prime spot in Tokyo for flower viewing.
Sensōji is Tokyo’s oldest standing temple and is dedicated to Kannon, a major bodhisattva in both Japanese and Chinese Buddhism. She takes on many forms but is most often venerated as the goddess of mercy, and many pray to her for success or freedom from suffering. I myself went up the grand steps of the main temple to throw a 5-yen coin (around five cents) into the offering box and ask for her divine guidance. As a good luck charm, I carry around a small omamori (protective charm) from the temple as well, with the characters 心願成就, which translates roughly into “the answering of one’s prayers,” embroidered upon it.
I have been to Sensōji many times, but this time, I came for the cherry blossoms. There are small, quiet gardens scattered all over the temple grounds, and every time a breeze came through, it would ruffle the trees and small pink petals would come sailing into the palm of my hand. Going down a wide sidewalk, I could see the cherry blossoms and temple to my right and in the distance, the hazy outline of Tokyo Skytree, one of the tallest towers in Japan. Looking at this blend of the old and eternal, the ephemeral and the new, I felt a deep affection for the aesthetics and scenery of Japan.

Since childhood, we have always been told to sit up straight and stand tall. Though at times this was an annoyance and we wanted our mothers to stop, there was quite a bit of truth in the request. As we age, one of the quickest things to fall short, besides the obvious of our eyesight and hearing, is our posture — many fear the dreaded “hunchback.”
I can assure you though that this is preventable. Your posture and movement can reveal not just your attitude and thoughts, but also your confidence. Nothing is more telling than how you physically hold yourself because your body language can say so much…without saying anything at all.
According to Albert Mehrabian, a professor at UCLA who studies psychology, 93 percent of your communication is body language and only 7 percent is actually your words.
So, how can you make sure you are coming across professionally, confidently, and engaged to your peers? Check yourself out. Become mindful and aware of what you usually would ignore on a daily basis and coach your body into having a ‘backbone.’ Notice how you sit and if its upright or slouched, how you stand and if its tall, how you use your hands and legs and what you do while talking to someone. Some of these small bits of knowledge get lost along the way as we age because other matters become our priority, but when you feel good and take care of yourself, everything falls into place.
The position of the human body acts as a direct window into the brain. If you’re slouching in your chair or resting your head on your arms when talking to someone, you appear bored, uninterested and a bit insecure. Standing tall with a straight spine and your head held high, almost like a magnet to the ceiling, conveys your eagerness and interest. Plant your feet on the floor or cross your legs at the knees—though this is generally seen as more casual and relaxed, it’s still appropriate. You can also cross your legs at the ankles or press your knees together, slanting your legs to one side.
Facial expressions — like raising your eyebrows, breaking into a smile, or furrowing your brow — can speak your thoughts and emotions. Smiling obviously means we are happy, but if we have a plain still look on our face it can come off as angry or sad even if we don’t intend it to. Think about what your face is saying, even when your mouth isn’t moving. A small, calm smile will always make you appear neutral, friendly and approachable, and nodding and raising your eyebrows shows you agree with someone. Keep consistent eye contact with a person who’s speaking to you because it will show you’re involved in what he or she is saying.
Doing so can make you seem defensive or guarded. Keep your legs relaxed as well, but a slight cross at the ankles is acceptable. Many individuals are known as “shakers,” where they subconsciously will have a shake in their leg when they are sitting down.
Lighten up a little: don’t take yourself too seriously! People will be a lot more inclined to listen and respect you if you seem to be a positive and outgoing person. Smile when you’re introduced to someone and show that you’re engaged and care. And last but not least, keep a positive, open and relaxed attitude. How you feel will come through in your body language and something this small can really make a major difference.

Much of this year’s campus controversy has stemmed from the unfiltered social media app, YikYak, where people can anonymously post threads and comments, using an ‘up-vote down-vote’ system as a marker of popularity. The danger of giving college students unlimited access to an anonymous forum is evident: insensitive jokes, racial slurs and personal attacks are plentiful.
But while the evident teenage immaturity is pervasive through much of the lighthearted yet questionable postings, it is unfortunate that YikYak has become more of a gossip site and less of a true unfiltered outlet for students to express their thoughts. We should utilize this resource more seriously, and limit extraneous and non-constructive comments that deter users from actual conversation that could potentially incite change in our academic community.
In a university setting, it can be daunting to truly voice your opinions publicly, which is perhaps part of the reason YikYak has become so popular. The app provides a consequence-free platform for student opinion, good or bad, mild or harsh. Much of what is said university-wide, whether through official press releases, student-run organizations, or even publications such as The Daily Trojan are subject to stringent scrutiny. We are in a microcosmic society that promotes criticism, whether it be constructive or not. After all, tuition itself is nearly $50,000. For paying that annual price, shouldn’t we be entitled to a perfect educational setting?
No, of course not. No university is perfect, and it is, of course, impossible to please everyone. But anonymous postings like YikYak are important in identifying potential campus issues that can be addressed.
Sifting through some of the disingenuous “jokes” may be pertinent in finding reoccurring student life issues. For example, negative comments about specific sororities or fraternities may be attributed to members of the community jaded by Greek life, but consistent posts about Greek-university relations should prompt us to think about the plausible divisions between the respective communities.
It is impractical to expect that everyone will go about voicing their anonymous opinions respectfully, but as members of the same, unified community, we should all work together to address solvable and reoccurring problems. For example, as of late, complaints about various aspects of the Undergraduate Student Government have become commonplace. Though it is hard to evaluate these claims and accusations without knowing more information, perhaps it is a topic we ought to delve into.
After all, ignorance isn’t bliss. As university students, we should aim to expand our knowledge, rather than complain endlessly or ignore potentially pertinent issues in our community.
