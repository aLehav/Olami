Pop star and actor Troye Sivan stressed the importance of individuality during the creative process in professor Mary Murphy’s “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” class Monday.
Sivan was recently nominated for a Golden Globe Award for “Revelation,” his song contribution to “Boy Erased” — a movie about small-town boy Jared Eamons who is forced to undergo conversion therapy. He also starred in the movie.
“I got a part in the movie as an actor and I was so over the moon about it,” Sivan said.  “I thought, ‘I have to weasel myself into the movie as a musician, as well.’” 
Sivan said the song was inspired by  a sweet, tender scene which had a piano melody in the background but no lyrics. Sivan said he co-wrote the song with a friend in under an hour.
“I am so proud of everything the movie stands for,” Sivan said. “Anything I could have done to amplify the message of the movie, I did.” 
Sivan said he wanted to support the conversations the movie started about conversion therapy and society’s treatment of the LGBTQ community.
In relation to his experience, Sivan said that he never anticipated the positive response to his coming out video, which he posted on YouTube in 2013. He said he was grateful to the online community, which served as a source of confidence for him to stay true to himself.
Sivan rose to stardom originally as a YouTube vlogger. He would upload videos of himself singing.
“I uploaded an original song that a record label in Australia saw,” Sivan said. “I got signed, made an E.P., put out a new song. I got an email from [manager] Dani a few weeks later.” 
Sivan said being a creative individual in the music industry is a difficult, yet often rewarding experience. 
“You need to trust the people around you,” he said. “You need to trust yourself. When you get it right it’s the best feeling in the world.” 
Sivan said he draws from his favorite artists and describes himself as a “pop student.” One of his newest singles, “Dance To This,” was inspired by a Janet Jackson song called “All Nite (Don’t Stop).”
Sivan urged the students in the audience to pursue their dreams to full capacity.
“Just start making stuff,” he said. “Reach out to people. Put yourself out there. Find beats on SoundCloud. Do whatever you need to do to keep pushing yourself. It doesn’t happen overnight unless you’re a meme or something.”  
Students were appreciative of Sivan’s advice for getting started in the industry and his humility in regard to his own career.
“It really struck me how sincere and candid he was,” said Maya Tribbitt, a sophomore majoring in journalism. “The authenticity that he showed to us made me feel comfortable with pursuing a career in the entertainment industry.” 
Sivan encouraged students to work toward their dreams regardless of the potential for failure, which Ana Garay Quezada, a sophomore majoring in international relations global business, said inspired her to pursue her creative goals.
“I love how he talked about everything he went through,” Garay said. “He made me realize that I have some things that I haven’t started because I’m too scared of failure. I definitely want to do it now. He motivated me.”

Three presidential tickets discussed student health care, diversity and freedom of speech at the annual Undergraduate Student Government presidential debate Monday, hosted by Annenberg Media. Annenberg Media executive editor Charlotte Pruett moderated the debate between candidates Michaela Murphy and Meagan Lane, Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin and Maxwell Brandon and Grayson Adler, which nearly 150 students attended at Wallis Annenberg Hall.
The Trenton & Mahin ticket and Maxwell & Grayson ticket are both write-in presidential candidates, which announced their candidacies past the official filing deadline. Both tickets will be included on the official ballot when voting begins Feb. 5.
Murphy, a junior majoring in public policy, began her opening statement by discussing how the USC administration has “failed its student body,” with a lack of transparency from the presidential search committee and throughout the ongoing investigation into the behavior of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who was  accused of sexual misconduct.
“Our campaign is built not only on hope, but on proof,” Murphy said. “We have spent this entire last year as senators working not only to improve existing resources, but to create ones of our own.”
Tahsin, a junior majoring in economics and business administration, began her opening remarks by explaining that she approached Stone to run as write-in candidates after realizing the student body should have more options. 
“After careful and extensive reflection, we decided to run as a presidential duo,” Tahsin said. “The undergraduate student body deserves an alternative choice in who best represents their interests.”
Brandon began his opening statement by emphasizing that both he and Adler have deep history as legacy members of the Trojan family. Adler’s father is a member of USC’s Board of Trustees. 
“Our campaign slogan is ‘Bring Back Victory,’” Brandon said. “We want to restore the pride in USC. USC has a foundation of winning and quite frankly we don’t feel like USC wins anymore. Our traditions … [are] beginning to tarnish.” 
Murphy and Lane are both USG senators and Stone and Tahsin both serve as USG funding directors. Neither Brandon nor Adler have been involved with USG, but both are members of the USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, a group that brought conservative commentator Ben Shapiro to campus last October, prompting protests and backlash from several student groups. 
In light of rising discussion regarding students’ ability to challenge USG funding for events like Shapiro’s, Pruett asked the candidates about their stance on the decision to bring Shapiro to campus last semester and what they would do for similar situations in the future. 
Adler said he believes anyone has a right to speak on campus as long as their speech does not incite violence. He also thanked Stone and Tahsin for approving the funding for the event last semester. 
Murphy said her campaign’s position is that the approval of campus speakers requires deeper analysis. Murphy has voiced concerns about the delegation of USG funds for controversial speakers at past USG Senate meetings.
“The positions of president and vice president are uniquely qualified, to not only serve the 19,000 undergraduates here, but you have a special task to protect the least protected on this campus,” Murphy said. “[You] certainly do not have … a constitutional nor intrinsic right to the student programming fee money of the communities which your rhetoric is further marginalizing. Full stop.” 
Later, Pruett asked the candidates about the perceived crackdown on Greek life on campus and if they would work with fraternities and sororities during their presidencies. 
“We do believe that Greek life is a fundamental tradition and is a tenet of the school,” Stone said. “But, in the end, we believe that Greek organizations deserve the same kind of respect and judicial process that other students receive … currently SJACS has some flawed measures in place.” 
Lane said there should be a balance between student safety and well-being and due process for Greek organizations.
“As a member of a Greek organization myself, I understand the challenges that come with inherent risks of being attached to a name like USC,” Lane said. “Also balancing having fun and being a 20-something-year-old kid in a sorority, and sometimes things happen, … but we want to see a balance with that.”
Brandon said that from a safety standpoint, he does not see the benefit of the Department of Public Safety cracking down on Greek life and forcing such organizations to spread out throughout the community.
“I think that it is definitely more beneficial for the student’s enjoyment and safety to focus emphasis on containing parties to the Row by obviously having guidelines that do support safety,” Brandon said. “But also letting them feel that they could … promote brotherhood and sisterhood.”
Students had the opportunity to submit questions prior to and during the event. Calvin Carmichael, a freshman majoring in business administration (cinematic arts), asked the candidates about their plans to address the low percentage of black undergraduate students on campus, most recently reported by USC as 4.6 percent.
Adler said USC has better representation of black students on campus than UCLA and UC Berkeley, and Brandon spoke about the importance of outreach to children and teenagers who may apply to the University. 
According to their respective websites, UCLA’s undergraduate population is currently 5.2 percent black, while Berkeley’s is 3 percent.
“Candidly, I’m very disappointed in that answer,” Murphy said. “[4.6] percent is a staggeringly low number … it doesn’t matter what top-tier institution we rank just behind … that’s horrible.” 
After the candidates were asked about the problem of fake IDs in USC Village, the room erupted in laughter. While Stone said he plans to work with DPS as part of their general campaign platform, Brandon said he believes in students making their own decisions. Murphy said she believes there are “bigger fish to fry,” and Lane questioned the implication that USC Village caused a rise in fake ID usage when it has been an ongoing problem for the University. 
All three tickets emphasized the need for reform in the Engemann Student Health Center, which the candidates said currently lacks resources for students. The candidates also discussed issues of funding in reference to mental health resources and on-campus counselors. 
Adler said he and Brandon promise to donate their combined stipends, which add up to $18,000 per year according to the USG bylaws, to a cause of undergraduate students’ choosing each month. Lane said she doesn’t have the same ability to donate the paychecks she depends on. 
“Michaela and I understand that not everybody has the type of privilege to [donate their stipend],” Lane said. “If I didn’t get a scholarship, I wouldn’t be at USC … [Being a senator] is the only job I have right now. I’m taking 20 units, and my last paycheck still wasn’t even enough for my light bill.” 
Voting for USG elections will take place online from Feb. 5 to 7.

Students scribbled personal struggles on a chalkboard and poster at the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s fifth Heritage Festival Extravaganza Monday. The Extravaganza kicked off the annual semester-long festival that will focus on the theme  “Strength in Struggle,” through multiple events including keynote speakers, movie nights and other activities. 
APASA Programming Director June Moon wanted this  year’s theme to focus on Asian Americans’ struggles throughout history.
“A lot of the Asian [and] Pacific Islander experience in America is really deeply rooted in our struggles and also, consequently, our triumphant moments,” said Moon, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science and business administration. “From our heritage to our culture right now, [it] is all about struggle.”
The festival is entirely run by undergraduates. Programming is split between the executive board and APASA interns. 
As one of the activities present at the festival, students were able to interact with their struggles by writing them down.
“I think, at the end, when you get to read everything [on the board], you gain everybody’s perspectives on the different levels of struggle that there are,” said APASA intern Kimberly Phung, a sophomore majoring in accounting. 
The chalkboard was full within the first hour of the event, with responses such as, “I struggle because my parents are immigrants,” or “I struggle because I am a woman.” Attendees crowded around the art piece, taking photos and reading responses out loud to each other.
“The interactive art piece is not just for Asian Americans, but for everyone, which is why it is so all-encompassing,” said APASA co-assistant director Joshua Limlingan, a junior majoring in human biology.
After writing, students shared stories of struggles and discussed the meaning of the event with APASA members. 
“It’s really empowering to see all of these other people and seeing this vulnerable side that we really try to, at least as an Asian American community, …  hide,” said Michael Chun, a sophomore majoring in economics. “Being vulnerable is really powerful.” 
“Considering we have 27 different member organizations that span from the Chinese American Student Association to the Pacific Islanders Student Association and everywhere in between, we really wanted to help bond all of our organizations together but also reach out to the greater USC community,” said APASA historian Ashton Tu, a sophomore majoring in media arts and practice and communication. 
The schedule for the rest of APASA’s festival has yet to be released.

Former professor Jucheng Chen from the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry filed a civil case lawsuit against the University Jan. 16 for alleged age discrimination, employer retaliation and wrongful discharge in lieu of public policy, according to a lawsuit obtained by the Daily Trojan. 
In the lawsuit, Chen named USC, dentistry school Executive Associate Dean for Academic, Faculty and Student Affairs Mahvash Navazesh and Chair of Periodontology, Diagnostic Science and Dental Hygiene Casey Chen as the defendants of the case. Chen is suing the defendants for monetary damages and punitive action regarding his termination.
“We all hope USC would be better, more transparent,” Chen said. 
Chen was employed by the University for 20 years and was appointed to the USC Provost’s “Task Force on Teaching Excellence” in March 2016, a year prior to his termination.
Chen alleged that his termination was sparked by an incident in 2017 after he noticed his students’ grades were changed without his approval. His primary role at the time was as a teacher’s assistant, and he was responsible for the grades of 16 freshmen.
“[Chen] believed a hacking mishap was more likely than not since, to his knowledge, his freshman grades had never been changed before and were based off USC’s own grading criteria and procedures,” the lawsuit read. 
According to the lawsuit, Chen reported the situation on April 10 to the Office of Academic Affairs as a breach in the University servers, but he was soon notified by the University’s technical department that the course grades had been altered without his own approval. 
“[Chen] received startling news from the IT department the next day” the lawsuit read.  “IT confirmed … that the changing of Plaintiff’s grades was intentional and was done at the direction and behest of Associate Dean, Defendant [Mahvash] Navazesh.” 
In response to the situation, Chen complained to other faculty and reported the incident, citing a cause of fraud. However, no action was taken thereafter. 
Ten days after the complaint was filed, Chen received a termination letter, which he claims was the University’s retaliation to his protected complaint of academic violation.
Navazesh and Chen have denied all accusations, according to the lawsuit.
“When Plaintiff pressed for an explanation regarding the alteration, Defendants Navazeh and Chen could not and/or refused to provide one and wished him well in his future endeavors,” the lawsuit read. 
The Daily Trojan reached out to Navazesh and Dr. Casey Chen for comment but was directed to University Media Relations.
“At the request of a number of students, an internal review was conducted of the grades assigned to that portion of the course,” the University wrote in statement to the Daily Trojan. “Based on that review, adjustments were made by a course co-director in a manner that was judged to be a more accurate reflection of the students’ work.” 
Though the University maintains that student grades were changed after careful evaluation of the course, Chen alleged that he was wrongfully terminated after reporting the incident.  
“Both Dr. Chen and I care about the integrity of the school … I think it’s very important that when speech of this nature occurs, the victim has the right to tell his narrative and to see justice,” said Chen’s lawyer Kevin Chiang, an alumnus from the Gould School of Law. “Our hope at the end of the day is that Dr. Chen is able to tell his story, let the facts speak for themselves and ultimately to let the judicial system adjudicate this matter in accordance with the law. 
The Los Angeles Superior Court has set a jury trial for the case at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. At the time of publication, no trial date had been set. According to University Media Relations, USC is currently not represented by legal counsel.
Chiang said the trial is expected to take anywhere from six months to two years. 
“[We] are prepared to litigate the case for however long the process requires,” Chiang said in an email to the Daily Trojan.

As the Trojans marched off the field at the Coliseum on Nov. 24 later after another heartbreaking 24-17 loss — the team’s seventh of the season — to archrival Notre Dame, there was certainly a belief amongst the USC faithful that this was the point at which the team had bottomed out. A season that would end with no bowl game for the first time since 2011 and four rivalry losses (five including Texas), the program fell from the leader of the West to the laughing stock of the nation’s worst Power Five conference. 
Surely, Trojan fans thought, there would be massive, unmistakable changes in the team culture, if not personnel. These hopes were swiftly dashed the next morning when USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann released a statement backing maligned head coach Clay Helton and ensuring that the team would remain on its current path. In his statement, Swann affirmed that “Helton has a plan in place to get USC back to the top.”
Over the ensuing months, what Swann could have described as an off-year for a blue chip program with loads of young talent has devolved into an ugly nightmare that gets comically worse by the day.
On Dec. 5, USC appeared to have made possibly the most impactful coaching hire in the sport when they signed former Texas Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury as its new offensive coordinator and, in the most obvious unspoken way, the “head-coach-in-waiting” akin to the likes of Oklahoma’s Lincoln Riley.
The excitement around the hire was not limited to fans, as USC Athletics sprung into high gear to promote the great victory of picking up Kingsbury. USC sent emails to fans asking them to renew season tickets with an advertisement prominently featuring Kingsbury. The team’s Twitter account gleefully posted videos of him settling into an office in Heritage Hall and ESPN reporter Shelley Smith even conducted an interview with Kingsbury regarding his decision to join the Trojans, where he deflected questions about NFL jobs by saying, “This isn’t a one month process … I want that job.”
The sky, however, caved in when it was announced on Jan. 8, just over a month after he became a member of the Trojans, that Kingsbury had accepted a job to become the next head coach of the Arizona Cardinals. Reportedly, Kingsbury was easily able to take such a job due to the fact that the contract he signed listed his buyout at an insignificant $150,000, which the Cardinals covered without hesitation. 
It was bad enough that Kingsbury, the man labeled by fans and — to a degree — the program as the future of Trojan football, had left before seeing the field. But the timing of the decision could not have been worse. It came just weeks after Early Signing Day and days removed from star receivers Bru McCoy and Kyle Ford announcing their commitments to USC on national television. This sent the situation into further freefall behind the scenes.
The extreme discontent was made public on Thursday when McCoy, the sole 5-star recruit and clear leader of an uncommonly low-ranked 2019 recruiting class for USC, made it known that he intended to transfer from USC after spending just 16 days on campus. Despite the obvious wealth of talent at the position with junior Michael Pittman, redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown, fans saw the loss of McCoy as the yet another final nail in the coffin for a once-great program.
While all this madness has proceeded on and off campus, one man has been very obviously silent: Swann. Aside from making a few comments leading up to and following the hiring of Kingsbury, the athletic director hasn’t discussed football matters for months. It would be alarming for that to be the case in a business-as-usual offseason, but in a year such as this one, it has USC fans and boosters prepared to bring out their pitchforks.
The time for sadness and disappointment is long gone. In fact, it’s possible that the time for pitchforks has passed as well. At this point, the USC “faithful” have begun to show signs of total disillusionment with the team, coaches and administration. Many fans, boosters and supporters are simply beginning to take their balls and go home. 
USC is under the leadership of an interim president with no timeline for finding a replacement and is in a town such as Los Angeles, where there have always been better sports options (and now, better football options) — it is a death knell to see USC football fall into such disarray.
How much further down the rabbit hole this program will go is yet to be seen, but as things stand today, Swann needs to act swiftly and deliberately. 
Every hour he shies away from the microphone, another season ticket holder backs out. The reported hiring of Graham Harrell as offensive coordinator is potentially a positive step, but it wouldn’t be a problem if Swann hadn’t dropped the ball on Kingsbury’s contract.
The ball is firmly in Swann’s court, and if he has any intention on remaining employed at a school with expectations as high as USC’s, he will get in front of the press and, for the first time in months, do his job.

After securing their first Pac-12 victory of the season last weekend against UCLA, the USC women’s basketball team fell short of another conference win this weekend in Arizona. The Trojans narrowly lost to the Wildcats 71-68 on Friday before suffering a tough 68-59 defeat to No. 21 Arizona State on Sunday.
Friday’s showdown with Arizona was a close contest at first, with each team posting 16 first quarter points. USC countered Arizona’s four first quarter threes with a well-rounded attack, sinking baskets from both inside and outside the arc. This offensive momentum continued into the second quarter for the Trojans, fueled by junior guard Minyon Moore, who scored 8 straight points in the quarter. Moore totaled a team-high 20 points and six assists on the night, capturing the No. 9 spot on the Trojans’ all-time list for assists.
USC’s 33-28 halftime lead was quickly snapped up by the Wildcats, who mounted a 10-0 rally in the third, keeping the Trojans at bay. The Trojans, who average 30.8 percent from behind-the-arc this season, only managed to make six 3-pointers in 24 total attempts. Arizona’s 61.5 percent shooting from the field in the third, coupled with the rebounding efforts of redshirt junior forward Dominique McBryde, were key in its third quarter dominance.
After falling behind by 13 points with just eight minutes to go, the Trojans cut Arizona’s lead down to just 3 points. However, they were unable to send off a final shot to tie, and the Wildcats emerged victorious.
While the Trojans usually rise to the challenge defensively, allowing 62.1 points per game, they struggled to prevent the Wildcats from scoring, especially in the second half. Four Wildcats achieved double-digit scoring on the night, with redshirt sophomore guard Aari McDonald leading the pack at 20 points.
Sunday’s game against Arizona State began with another achievement for Minyon Moore: her 1,000th career point. Again, the Trojans got off to a strong start on both ends of the court, leading the Sun Devils 18-14 heading into the second.
However, five fouls in just two minutes allowed ASU to keep possession in the second quarter. The Trojan offense was halted in a 10-0 run for the Sun Devils.
“We need to be better, we need to be more attentive on defense,” said senior guard Aliyah Mazyck regarding the Trojan’s foul trouble. “We need to understand that it’s not up to just five players. Everybody has to play their role and fill in when people can’t.”
At halftime on Sunday, the Trojans’ focused on their third quarter play, aiming to avoid a poor offensive and defensive performance similar to theirs against Arizona.
“That’s always been our point of emphasis in the locker room, that we have to come out strong [in the third quarter] because we usually don’t,” Mazyck said. “We just try to bring that energy and get it one notch up because everyone knows that we always lose in the third.”
The Trojans stayed close throughout, trailing by 4 with two minutes left on the clock. However, the Sun Devils closed out the game without conceding a comeback effort from the Trojans.
The Sun Devils were able to shut down many of USC’s starters offensively in holding the Trojans to just 59 points.  Moore, who is first in scoring for the Trojans this season, was held to only 8 points, while junior forward Kayla Overbeck shot just 1-of-7 from the field.
Despite the weekend’s disappointing outcomes, the Trojans’ ability to stay within striking distance against talented conference opponents suggests the team’s improvement. 
“As a team, we’re just growing in an upward direction,” Mazyck said. “Even though we haven’t got the outcomes that we wanted, we’ve seen glimpses of us being a better team. We’ve seen this growth, and I can see it in everyone.”
The conference action continues this weekend for the Women of Troy as they take on Washington and Washington State at the Galen Center.

Following an impressive weekend of competition at the Martin Luther King Jr. Invitational in Albuquerque, N.M., the Trojan track and field team went to Lubbock, Texas, last weekend to compete in the Texas Tech Invitational. 
Up against Big-12 and Pac-12 competition, the Trojans succeeded with eight victories from the event.
The crop of freshmen has competed in impressive fashion from the start of the season, with two more first place finishes coming from Trojan newcomers this weekend after 13 at the Martin Luther King Jr. Invitational. Distance runner Alyssa Brewer ran a time of 2:06.48 in the women’s 800-meter to secure the win, defeating last year’s NCAA champion Sammie Watson of Texas A&M. 
Brewer’s time was good for third on the Trojans’ all-time list. Freshman hurdler Ayden Owens collected his second first place finish in as many weeks with a victory in the men’s heptathlon, setting a school record with a point total of 5,642.
Junior distance runner Isaiah Jewett set a USC record with a time of 1:46.91 in the men’s 800-meter, although he finished second in the event.
Three sophomores set personal records at the meet. Sprinter TeeTee Terry continued her streak of dominance, winning the women’s 60-meter dash with a personal record of 7.15 seconds to add to her two victories last week. Terry has yet to be defeated this season. 
Sophomore Kaelin Roberts set a personal record in the women’s 400-meter, running a time of 52.25 seconds. Sophomore hurdler Chanel Brissett provided another first place finish for the Trojans in the women’s 60-meter hurdle with her personal record of 7.98 seconds.
Sophomore jumper Earnest Sears duplicated his impressive performance from the prior weekend to finish first in the men’s high jump, once again clearing the same personal record height of 7 feet 5.25 inches to secure the win on his first try. Once again, Sears came close to clearing the next height of 7 feet 6.25 inches, though he ultimately fell short. 
A clearance at that height would give Sears the USC record in the event, surpassing the record of 7 feet 6 inches held by redshirt senior jumper Randall Cunningham and USC alumnus Jesse Williams. Sears has been dominant in the early season, and already seems to be on the verge of taking a shot at that mark. It’ll be a storyline worth monitoring throughout the long remainder of the season.
Senior jumper Margaux Jones has also impressed in back-to-back weeks, winning the women’s long jump for the second competition in a row with a 20-9.25. That mark represents a huge step of progress for Jones, who hadn’t cracked the 20-foot mark since last indoor season, as she struggled with injuries during the outdoor campaign. Her showing on Saturday is a promising sign for the rest of her final season as a Trojan.
The Trojans collected their final victory of the competition with a first place finish in the women’s 4×400 relay, with a team of juniors Anna Cockrell and Kyra Constantine, freshman Bailey Lear and sophomore Kaelin Roberts. The quartet managed a time of 3:31.25, winning the event.
With impressive showings in the first two weeks of competition in their pocket, the Trojans will look to continue their success next weekend at the Tyson Invitational in Fayetteville, Ark. It will be their first time facing SEC opposition this season.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team maintained its undefeated streak at the CBU Mini Invitational in Riverside on Saturday with two shutout victories against Concordia University and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. 
Twelve Trojans scored in the first game of the doubleheader as USC, which holds a record of 8-0, beat Concordia uncontested 21-0. It was a well-rounded attack: Freshman 2-meter Mireia Guiral led the team with 4 points, while freshmen utility Bayley Weber, 2-meter Tilly Kearns, freshman driver Alejandra Aznar, sophomore driver Sabrina Garabet and junior utility Maud Megens all finished the game with multiple goals. 
Junior driver Denise Mammolito, sophomore driver Paige Hauschild, junior driver Kelsey McIntosh, freshman 2-meter Julia Rozolis-Hill, freshman utility Claire Haas and freshman driver Sophia Lucas all contributed points as well. 
Senior goalie Amanda Longan anchored the Trojan defense with nine saves. The game marked Longan’s fourth career shutout. 
“As a goalie, it’s really important to run the defense as best as I can because I can see things as they go on from a better angle [than the other players] can, so I make myself talk and be vocal the whole time so that I’m occupied,” Longan said. 
The Trojans continued their strong momentum on both offense and defense in the second game of the day, securing a 23-0 victory over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. 
Thirteen Trojans scored in the victory, led by Anzar with 4 points. Sophomore driver Verica Bakoc, Hauschild, Megens, Guiral, freshman driver Grace Tehaney and sophomore driver Kari Jensen also scored multiple times. Junior driver Elise Stein, Weber, Mammolito, McIntosh, Rozolis-Hill and Kearns notched points as well.
Junior goalie Holly Parker manned the net with five saves, securing her first career shutout. 
Although the Trojans dominated in both games, Longan said that they can always find ways to improve their performance.
“I think adjusting to switch ups so when we call something, and then the other team counters that with something a little trickier [could be improved],” she said. “Making that adjustment faster is something we could do better.”
Mammolito said the team could bring more attention to its decision-making during games.
“There were a few passes that we made that weren’t great, and at times we forced things, but for the most part, I think that we made the right decisions and executed,” she said. 
USC was successful at implementing the defenses they have been working on in practice and also pushing the counter attack and finishing high opportunity shots, according to Mammolito.
Longan said communication was also key in the two victories on Saturday. 
“I think something for us that we did better that we hadn’t in previous games is we communicated more, which is big especially for the younger players to use their voices,” Longan said. “That way, when [Coach Vavic] would call something, we were all on the same page, so everything functioned like a system should.”
The Trojans stay in home waters this week in an exhibition game to take on the Chinese national team, which some members of the USC women’s team have trained with in the past. The game will be played on Thursday at 5 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

If the Academy Awards are meant to encapsulate the year in film, they’ve definitely tried their best this year. Of course, the Academy’s “best” is more like a good sporting shot. 
Leading the charge is the beguiling Best Picture race, which features three films that arguably have no business being there — nearly half of the eight nominees. Leading the snubs are, among others, Barry Jenkins’ “If Beale Street Could Talk” (only three nominations) and “First Reformed” (only one nomination, and no, it’s not for Ethan Hawke). But with the snubs come the delightful surprises, like “Roma” which collected 10 nominations (the most for any film this year, tied with “The Favourite”) including Best Actress and Supporting Actress. 
Save for the notable snubs, we are still in a rare year when it comes to the Best Picture race. Out of the eight films nominated, six can be classified as more comedy than drama, three were in the top 20 highest grossing list of 2018 (whereas 2017 had two and 2015 according to Box Office Mojo.nd 2016 only one) and “Black Panther” is the first superhero movie to be nominated for Best Picture. It’s a film columnist’s buffet. 
So much can be said about how the way we consume movies affects the Academy’s choices, but with four of the Best Picture candidates, there is an ideological thread to follow: “Black Panther,” “BlacKkKlansman,” “Green Book” and “Vice” all are — or at least, attempt to be — socially conscious films. The first three point to important racial issues, while “Vice” points to, well, a lot of issues in our government’s immediate history. 
Either for better or for worse, none of these movies beat around the bush. “Black Panther” is a hopeful rendition of an Afrofuturist society where the marginalized are the heroes. “BlacKkKlansman” feels like director Spike Lee forcing America to look in a mirror for its own good. “Green Book,” easily the most problematic of the bunch, is cathartic but perhaps too on-the-nose about the power of friendship easily overcoming racism. And “Vice” is chock-full of tricks and gimmicks which, at their core, are the product of a man angry with the powers that be. 
Because film is a medium of communication, the best ones must communicate their themes clearly to the audience. “Green Book” and “Vice” — compared to the others, the worst of this bunch — really do transmit their (albeit divisive) ideas. Adam Mckay’s “Vice” is basically a glorified Twitter rant that’s never shy about @ing who it’s mad at, while “Green Book” has come under fire for its simplistic and erroneous portrayal of this interracial friendship, according to the real-life family of Don Shirley, who Mahershala Ali plays in the film. 
“Black Panther” and “BlacKkKlansman” also have clearly conveyed messages. The difference here is that these films achieve a zen-like balance between formal and thematic elements — their technical proficiency expertly complements their core ideas. On the other hand,  the gimmicks in “Vice” sometimes push the film toward losing its grasp on its themes and the cookie-cutter plot in “Green Book” just recycles aged clichés. 
In 2019, it’d be foolish to think controversy won’t exist regardless of who the nominees are. Yet, the Academy has made questionable choices in the past — it often favors tradition over trends. Although we are mired in uncertainty until the awards ceremony on Feb. 24, one thing is certain: The mere fact that people take the ideas in these films so seriously is a testament in itself to the efficacy of the medium. 
Whether we as viewers are conscious of this or not, films are the country’s primary ideological exports to the rest of the world; in many ways, they’re the thermometer that registers America’s political and cultural temperature.  One such product last year was Jordan Peele’s “Get Out,” which pushed that proverbial thermometer into precarious heights. If we take its Oscar loss as a hint, it becomes clear that the Academy doesn’t like when its nominees bring raw, earnest expression toward real issues in their films. 
I don’t think anybody knows what’s going to happen at the 91st Academy Awards. I don’t think anyone can fully comprehend the Academy’s preferred tastes; it’s an elusive body capable of turning on a dime from “Moonlight” to “The Shape of Water.” And that’s just in the past two years. So yeah, I wouldn’t get my hopes up.

The LA Art Show impressed last week with gorgeous galleries featuring artists’ work from around the world. The West Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center created an isolated bubble for art lovers to peruse thousands of works over the course of five days. The floor was divided into galleries of different genres, each with its own unique theme and collection.  
While the show was grand in scale, it felt far from overwhelming. Attendees could take their time to walk through the maze of different artists’ works without feeling a need to rush — a refreshing change from many shows and conventions that emphasize size over quality and curation. 
LA Art Show featured artworks in a number of categories, including traditional themes such as modern and contemporary works, but also more creative themes like “DIVERSEartLA” and “Littletopia.” Perhaps the most intriguing category is Featured Programming, a group of thought-provoking artwork and performances spread throughout the floor. 
One of the show’s most prominent features was the vast amount of international artwork on display — most notably from Asian artists such as Amano Yoshitaka, Kato Ai, Ohata Shintaro and Chuni Park. Yoshitaka’s works contained a vast, eye-catching blend of anime artwork and ’70s American pop art. Meanwhile, Ai’s work explores new anime fetishes with classic Asian art, and Shintaro combines 3-D sculptures of young girls with beautiful two-dimensional backgrounds to create eye-grabbing pieces. Park’s work is inspired by his own memories of life and nature, and the results are vast black landscapes that simultaneously evoke awe and terror.
Another enticing display was the latest of Mike Stilkey’s book cover paintings: a stunning female portrait made up of countless hardcover spines. Also an attention-grabber was the latest from WhIsBe, the New York-based street artist, which displayed yet another of his juxtapositional pieces: a giant gummy bear posing for a mug shot.
From the local art scene, the Beverly Hills art gallery Winn Slavin Fine Art was one of the show’s most well-curated sections. One of the exhibitions showcased the imaginative works of sculptor Boban. His metal sculptures, which are entirely comprised of spoons, depict heroic mythological figures rising out of the ground. Boban demonstrates through the statues how humanity can look to mythology to rise from failure. 
In another Winn Slavin exhibition, neo-expressionist artist Michael Desroches’ work took inspiration from therapy sessions with his patients. He uses his art to display the different emotions and colors of human therapy through abstract thinking. 
Also on display were some of the lost sketches of Salvador Dali from “Dali: The Argillet Collection,” the private collection of Dali’s publisher’s daughter. Ever since the closure of the French Dali museum, these sketches have not been available for view to the public. 
Winn Slavin’s last exhibition displayed the existential surrealism works of Vietnam refugee Sir Daniel K. Winn, whose sculptures reconstructs faces and hands with the use of masks. His early work as a medical face reconstructionist inspires most of the masks and works he creates.
Additionally, artist Robert Vargas painted a posed model in front of a live crowd at the show. There were also the provocative sculptures from graffiti artist RISK, which exposed police predation in our modern culture. His presentation included two pieces, a shark composed entirely of machine parts and a police car cruiser sliced in half. Zack Nation’s art gallery revealed a pop culture odyssey through a collection of original comic book and movie cover sketches. The curated collection included some original Spider-Man covers to the original sketches for the movie poster of the 1981 classic, “Clash of the Titans.”
With its vast and curated collection of art, LA Art Show excelled in providing plenty of opportunities for high-end consumers and gazing attendees alike. The annual art show ran from Jan. 23 to 27.
