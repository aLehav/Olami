After losing three games in a row, the Women of Troy hope that a return home in a break from conference play, will help them find their winning ways.
After losing 55-63 at Utah on Saturday. the Women of Troy (10-9, 5-4) will take on the the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos (8-11, 3-5) tonight at 7 p.m at the Galen Center. A win over the Gauchos would not improve USC’s conference record, but it could help the Women of Troy find their footing after dropping three consecutive games by eight points or less.

“Right now, it’s not about the other teams. The other teams aren’t beating us. We’re beating ourselves,” USC sophomore forward Cassie Harberts said. “We’re not playing how we normally play, and right now we’re in a funk.”
UCSB enters this game after losing two games in a row, both by four points. The Gauchos have a 3-6 record on the road. USC is 4-2 overall at the Galen Center and 2-0 against nonconference opponents at home.
Earlier in the month, the team was riding a five-game winning streak that pushed them to second in the Pac-12 standings.
Oregon State ended USC’s streak on Jan 21 with a four-point victory, which marked the beginning of USC’s skid. Since then, USC has fallen to fourth in the conference.
Nine and a half minutes into Saturday’s loss, the Utes were scoreless, and USC pulled out to an early 17-0 lead. A blowout victory looked imminent, but Utah fought back, with guard Michelle Plouffe’s 21 second-half points to upset the Women of Troy.
“We need to pick each other up after a shot,” freshman guard Ariya Crook said after scoring a career-high 17 points. “We need to encourage [each] other so we can all be on the same page.”
USC was without senior guard Briana Gilbreath, who sat out because of a knee injury sustained in a 67-69 loss to Colorado last Thursday.
Gilbreath, considered the team’s defensive leader, hopes to rejoin USC in its faceoff against UCSB, who has no players averaging double-digit points and averages only 52.6 points per game.
“Hopefully, we won’t let them have more than that, because I feel like if we get our defensive identity back, we can really lock down,” Harberts said.
The last time the two sides matched up, the Women of Troy overcame an 11-point deficit to defeat the Gauchos 67-64 in the opening round of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament.
The team needs to win all three games this week playing at home to have any chance whatsoever of making the ncaa tournament . Unfathomable to blow a seventeen pt. lead vs. a mediocre team like Utah. This has to fall on
the coaching staff. Looks like the tough non-conference schedule not paying dividends at this stage of the season.

The injuries keep mounting for the 6-16 USC men’s basketball team. They will be without power forward Dewayne Dedmon for the rest of the season. The 7-foot-tall redshirt sophomore suffered a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee and a bone bruise in the 74-50 loss to Colorado Thursday night.
Dedmon, who hails from Lancaster, Calif., has seen his share of injuries in his brief tenure.
He will miss the last 10 games of the season and the Pac-12 conference tournament. Although no surgery is needed, coach Kevin O’Neill and the training staff deemed him incapable of play.
“Obviously, it is another huge blow for us as we move forward,” O’Neill said in a press release.
Dedmon is now the fifth Trojan player that suffered a season ending injury. He joins his fellow teammates, senior guard Jio Fontan, sophomore forward Curtis Washington, redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller and redshirt sophomore forward Evan Smith.
The Trojans are now down to six players on scholarships who are a part of the active roster.
Dedmon averaged 7.6 points and 5.5 rebounds despite a hand and foot injury he suffered earlier in the season. Dedmon’s resilience brought attention from NBA scouts and, when healthy again, should bring it back again.

The USC men’s basketball snapped a nine-game losing streak Saturday after defeating the Utah Utes at the Galen Center.
The victory was long overdue as the Trojans were, at the time, winless in Pac-12 conference play and in 2012.
Many have questioned why the men’s basketball team has recently declined.
This season, the Trojans have seen many woes, all of which seem hard to believe considering they received an invitation to the big dance — the NCAA tournament — last season. USC lost to Virginia Commonwealth University in the opening round of the tournament.
The Trojans’ string of bad luck did not end there.
Forward Nikola Vucevic opted for the 2011 NBA draft following the failed NCAA tournament attempt.
During his career at USC, Vucevic averaged 11.1 points and eight rebounds per game. Vucevic wasn’t the only key departure from the USC roster. The 6-foot-10 forward Alex Stepheson, who was considered one of the top defenders in the conference, graduated in spring 2011.
With two influential players no longer on the roster, the Trojans, led by coach Kevin O’Neill, were determined to regain respect in the Pac-12 conference.
In August 2011, during an exhibition tournament in Brazil, USC suffered its most devastating setback.
Senior guard Jio Fontan suffered a season-ending injury, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament.
With Fontan injured, the Trojans have depended on sophomore guard Maurice Jones, who, at only 5 foot 7, has played nearly every minute of the season for USC. Even O’Neill stated in a press conference following Fontan’s injury that fans should not attend games if Maurice Jones is not playing.
While playing against Colorado on Thursday night, redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon tore his medial collateral ligament, sidelining him for the remainder of the season. Dedmon has been battling numerous injuries throughout the 2011-12 season. Despite losing the 7 footer, the Trojans won their first conference game of the season on Saturday with only six scholarship players.
It has been quite easy to point the finger at O’Neill and to discuss the proverbial hot seat.
Many forget, however, that O’Neill inherited the aftermath of previous coach Tim Floyd.
O’Neill, named head coach in mid-2009, was unable to compete in postseason play after USC self-imposed sanctions for NCAA rule violations committed by former player O.J. Mayo.
The sanctions also included a reduction in scholarships.
The Trojans were without an incentive to compete for the 2010 NCAA tournament but still managed to finish in the middle of the pack.
With other players stepping up to the high expectations of USC athletics, the Trojans seemed to regain their swagger in 2010-11.
Now in 2012, Trojan students and fans are debating whether or not O’Neill should return for one more year.
In reality, the situation that O’Neill inherited was not the best — sanctions and injuries along with young and inexperienced players.
It is in the best interest of the team and all Trojan fans to give O’Neill another year to potentially lead the Trojans to a conference championship and March Madness bid in 2013.
USC has faced much adversity and pure bad luck.
Next year, the Trojans will have a healthy Fontan, redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller and Dedmon, in addition to a more experienced roster.
Without a doubt, O’Neill deserves one more year.
 
“Armchair Quarterback” runs Tuesdays. If you would like to comment on this story, please visit dailytrojan.com or email Andie at ahageman@usc.edu
 
No he doesn’t deserve another year unless a somewhat divine intervention happens and the team wins a few
more games to finish the season. The win against the worst team in the Pac-12 playing at home proves absolutely nothing. The excuses are being over-played to exhaustion. This is his fifth stop at a division 1 university with an
overall losing record. Time for the athletic dept. to step up and get the basketball program to be one year in and
year out.

The No. 11 men’s golf team will tee off in its first spring competition at the 22nd Annual Amer Ari Invitational at King’s Course in Waikoloa, Hawaii on Wednesday.
USC will compete in a field of 20 teams, including No. 1 ranked Texas, No. 3 Auburn, No. 5 North Florida and reigning NCAA-champion Augusta State.
Under par · Senior Steve Lim is one of many Trojans hoping to start the spring season off on the right foot. The team finished No. 11 in 2011. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
The tournament is the team’s first since November 2011, when USC closed out its fall schedule by winning the Gifford Collegiate Championship in San Martin, Calif. Senior Steve Lim earned his first career individual victory at the event, which the Trojans won by four strokes overall.
The Gifford Collegiate Championship was one of three events USC competed in last fall.
Though it’s been two months since the team last entered a competitive tournament, their expectations remain just as high as before the hiatus.
“We’re coming off quite a long break, but the good news is we have a lot of motivated guys on the team who worked hard over winter break,” USC coach Chris Zambri said.
After winning the Pac-10 championship in 2011, the team is hoping that its success will continue carrying over to the inaugural Pac-12 2011-2012 season.
Junior Martin Trainer, who won the 2011 Pac-10 individual champion title and was named an All-Pac-10 first team member last year, should further bolster the veteran Trojan team even though he ranks at the bottom of the six-man squad with an average of 73.11 strokes.
Two-time All-Pac 10 second teamer Lim comes into Waikoloa leading the team with an average of 71.22 strokes and is ranked 24th individually.  Freshman Anthony Paolucci ranks second on the USC squad, with an average of 71.89 strokes. Sophomores Jeffrey Kang and Ramsey Sahyoun are averaging 72.56 and 72.67 respectively. Junior Sam Smith is averaging 72.50.
For sixth-year coach Zambri, the road to the first Pac-12 championship begins with the Amer Ari Invitational.
“Our expectations are to go out and compete for a title here,” Zambri said.
In his first five years as coach, Zambri has reached the NCAA championships every season and has won two Pac-10 titles along the way.
Six of the top-12 NCAA teams, including USC, are members of the Pac-12 — No. 2 Oregon, No. 4 UCLA, No. 7 Stanford, No. 10 Washington and No. 12 California.
No. 1 Texas comes into the invitational wielding the top two players in the country, senior Dylan Frittelli and freshman Jordan Spieth.
“They had a dominant fall,” Zambri said.
USC is scheduled to compete in five tournaments after the Amer Ari Invitational. At the end of the season the Trojans will host the NCAA Championships at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades.
The Amer Ari Invitational begins at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday and ends Saturday.

The USC Stevens Institute for Innovation recently released a report that addresses appropriations for university research, a key point in Obama’s State of the Union speech last week.
[Correction: A previous version of this article said the report released by the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation addressed problems in university research. The report focuses on the role of university research in policymaking. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
The “Universities in Innovation Networks: The Role and Future Promise of University Research in U.S. Science and Economic Policymaking” is the fourth report in the Doing What Works and Science Progress projects at the Center for American Progress.
Innovation · The Annenberg Innovation Lab, which opened in fall 2011, is an example of innovative research occurring at USC, according to the Stevens Institute. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Led by Vice Provost for Innovation and Executive Director of the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation Krisztina Holly, the report highlights the resources available at universities to stimulate growth and greater competitiveness for the country.
“Higher education plays a hugely important role in driving the economy,” Holly said. “Each year, universities get federal funding for research, and all of this can translate into products, companies and jobs.”
In the report, Holly addresses the ways in which federal policies and capacity for university research are tied together and outlines five recommendations to improve federal research and development policy so that universities can achieve their potential to spearhead innovation in key industries.
Melissa Lechner, a graduate student studying medicine in a PhD and MD program, said her work in cancer research can be attributed to the support she received from the university.
“The goal is to improve outcomes for patients,” Lechner said. “USC allowed me to take discoveries in basic science and translate it to patients in a rapid manner that wouldn’t have been possible on my own.”
Some of the challenges with the broader field of innovation involve measuring the impact, as it changes rapidly, and the perceived risk. But,as students try to prepare for the progressive workforce in this current economic and political climate, many are stepping up.
The USC Stevens Institute is just one of the many unique features at USC that are involved with promoting this innovation culture.
“These programs that are university-wide are aimed to nurture the culture of helping to transfer ideas to make an impact,” Holly said.
The USC Stevens Institute is also host of the USC Student Innovators Showcase during Trojan Family Weekend.
Ranging from projects on real-time cinema analysis of the presidential campaign to research on public interactive exhibits, the Annenberg Innovation Lab was created in 2009 to support students and faculty in their interdisciplinary efforts.
As the technology manager who works closely with student team projects, Dale MacDonald said, “The entity itself is an innovation and is going to lead to profound, transformative change along the way.”
Noting its charter to follow processes of innovation inspired by culture other than just technology, MacDonald encourages students to take advantage of opportunities like CRUNCH, the lab’s yearly design competition for USC students and alumni with a $30,000 prize.
Similarly, the Graduate Student Government hosts a yearly Poster Symposium that will soon include a website component to showcase innovative research done by USC graduate students across all departments and judged by USC faculty.
GSG Academic Affairs Director Jaclyn Selby, a graduate student studying global media and tech policy, said, “The point is so that people can see the best research at USC beyond what they know at their own department.”
If all it takes is an idea, students and faculty are right where they need to be to take advantage of some of the most forward thinking research and learning opportunities.  Holly said there are many opportunities in Los Angeles.
“Keep your eyes open,” Holly said. “Students should be excited by the potential to work on the next new thing.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report log between Friday, Jan. 27, and Sunday, Jan. 29.
Crimes against a person
AT 4:01 p.m. on Jan. 27, a student said that, for the past month, a non-USC female has been harassing him while he worked at the United University Church. The woman had previously been warned about her behavior, and church staff told DPS that she was no longer welcome on the premises. The woman could not be located at the time of the report.
Crimes against property
At 6:06 p.m.  on Jan. 29, a student  requested DPS assistance in retrieving the purse she lost while attending an event in Pasadena because the non-USC man who found it was being uncooperative when she called him. DPS contacted the man and advised him he was violating the law by keeping her belongings. He later gave the purse to another student, who  transferred it to the DPS office, where it was retrieved by the reporting student.
At 2:22 p.m.  on Jan. 27, a student said that clothing, his passport and miscellaneous photos were removed from his apartment at 2809 Ellendale Pl. He believes his ex-girlfriend took the property while she was left alone inside the apartment.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 1:46 p.M. on Jan. 27, DPS officers responded to a student who was reported unresponsive in a classroom at the Elaine and Kenneth Leventhal School of Accounting. The student was conscious when officers arrived and he told them he fell asleep and sometimes it can be difficult to wake him. A Los Angeles Fire Department RA unit examined the student and offered transportation, but the student declined and was released at the scene.
Falling asleep in accounting class, imagine that?

The USC Ostrow Dentistry School is updating its brand and website.
The school launched a new site last week as part of a larger campaign aimed at demonstrating leadership and medical excellence.
New roots · The USC Ostrow Dentistry School plans to hire a public relations firm in the coming months to promote its public brand. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The redesigned site now features a new web platform with updated information on the academic application process, requirements and courses for prospective students as well as information on the clinical services, opportunities and programs for its patients.
“The older site was hard to navigate through, wherein this new site is clear and focused. A prospective student can easily navigate through the new site and find all the information they need, and more,” said Tom Ericksen, a graduate student studying dental surgery.
Dean Avishai Sadan tweeted Thursday that one of the goals for the modified site is “to accommodate our largest web audiences, prospective students and patients.”
The school also plans to hire a public relations and advertising firm in the near future. Communication department associates said they plan to formally announce this later next week.
“Our clinical excellence sets the benchmark for all disciplines within dentistry including dental hygiene, DDS and our specialty programs. With more than 3,700 applicants annually, we are extremely competitive in the U.S.,” said Calen D.B. Ouellette, chair of development for alumni affairs and public relations at the Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC.
The six-month redesigning process for online development was provided in part by USC Web Services.

The focus of Monday’s monthly Dept. of Public Safety Student Affairs Council Forum was an incident involving a student who claims DPS followed him to an event and DPS’ use of social media outlets to prevent incidences around campus.
Max Hoiland, a senior majoring in cinema television and critical studies, expressed concerns about DPS officers, who he claimed followed him to an event earlier this semester. Hoiland said DPS officers brought a photo of him from his Facebook account to the event.
“They had a picture of me, and I found that pretty disturbing,” Hoiland said.
Though DPS Chief Carey Drayton was unable to deny the photo, he said Hoiland’s past actions had prompted some concerns.
“The concern was [Hoiland has], in the past, caused an interruption of the business operations of USC,” Drayton said.
Drayton told Hoiland that the officers were not at the event specifically because he was attending but because the event was controversial.
“Five officers weren’t there for [Hoiland],” Drayton said. “There was a lot of concern about that particular event.”
Drayton said DPS does use Facebook and other public information in preparation for events, particularly when they are controversial. Drayton also said DPS does not follow individual students.
“We don’t follow you around,” Drayton said. “I don’t have the resources to follow you around … when I’m worried about robberies and other things going on.”
At the start of the meeting, which was attended by 12 students, the creators of a mobile application for reporting safety concerns, That’s Suspicious Behavior, delivered a presentation.
The program, which is available for free on iPhones, allows anyone with a university email to anonymously report suspicious behavior. After the behavior is reported, it appears on a map of the university with a location and time for anyone to view on the app.
“It’s a virtual campus-watch asking students to help each other be safer,” said Brigette Kidd, a graduate student studying communication management, who had the idea for the application.
For now, Drayton said DPS is not monitoring the behavior reported with the application.
“We have limited resources so we can’t obligate resources just to watch a beta model or something we are trying out,” Drayton said.
Drayton said that could change, however, if there is a big push from students or other members of the community for DPS to monitor the application.
My political disagreements with USC policies, including its methods of surveillance and tracking of students, is nothing secret.  I have become somewhat accustomed to DPS and administrators talking about me behind closed doors and tracking which events I attend on campus (the event in the article was not the first time this has happened).  DPS has even approached a professor of mine who I was doing research with and questioned her about me and claimed I was breaking all kinds of school rules (I talked about these allegations with the head of Campus Activities, Heather Larabee, who is in charge of such things and said that I had not violated any rules as far as she could tell).
DPS pays attention to me.  Whatever.  It’s kind of creepy but I don’t lose any sleep over it.  However, what about other students on campus who are exploring politics and begin to express disagreement with the university?  Might such surveillance and tracking intimidate them and have the effect of silencing them?
There’s can be a thin line between “keeping students safe” and using security and surveillance in a way that represses student voices and I think DPS has crossed that line.
I’ve talked with Chief Drayton about these issues 1-on-1 on multiple occasions and we have our disagreements, but I would like to point out that much of what I see as abusive or invasive behavior by DPS officers isn’t initiated by DPS themselves, but given to them as orders by administrators.  My point in criticizing DPS practices here is to shed light on them and primarily to pressure the administration to step back and stop forcing DPS to do these things.
“The ways in which the loss of privacy destroys a society are somewhat abstract and difficult to articulate, though very real. A society in which people know they are constantly being monitored is one that breeds conformism and submission, and which squashes innovation, deviation, and real dissent.” – Glenn Greenwald
I’m glad that DPS’s use of social media to “watch out” for students at events has received this attention as it is a practice that I think takes surveillance too far.  DPS claims that it does things to keep students safe, but as Chief Drayton said during the forum, the primary reason I am “of concern” to USC is that when I approach administrators about political issues on campus, they think I’m “one level below Satan” by virtue of approaching them and disagreeing with them at all.
However, I was completely surprised to wake up this morning and find an article written about my relationship with DPS.  My full name and major were not mentioned at the forum, so did the reporter ask DPS for them afterwards?  There weren’t that many people at the event and I was sitting just a few feet from the reporter.  As far as I can surmise, the reporter approached DPS for my name and information and perhaps further clarification but did not approach me.  Why didn’t the reporter just do what reporters are supposed to do and talk to the people they’re writing articles about.  It would not have taken more than 30 seconds to get my name and info and no more than 1 minute more to get a statement if he wanted one.
The quotes from the article somewhat mischaracterize what was discussed at the forum.  Clarification:
-My relation with DPS was not “the focus” of the event, but one of many things discussed between students and DPS.
-Secondly, the claim that I was ‘followed’ at the event needs further clarification.  DPS doesn’t follow me around on facebook per se.  They look at events on campus via facebook and see who’s attending, which I think is pretty creepy.  From there, if there are any people that DPS has ‘red flagged’ in their system, they notify the officers attending the event, and in my case, print out a picture of me and give it to the officers.  Drayton contended that this did not constitute “following”, but I would disagree.  The fact is that DPS finds out where I will be, and then pre-emptively prints out pictures of me and distributes them to officers at events where they expect me to attend.  This spatial connections between myself, the events I will be attending, and DPS’s showing up with prior knowledge of my attendance and a picture of me, in my mind is something very close to ‘following’.
-The claim that DPS did have a picture of me at the event is something that Chief Drayton could not confirm or deny, as he either didn’t know about it or could easily deny it.  However, the night of the event where DPS had the picture of me, I spoke to the supervising officer, Lieutenant James W. Farrington, for the shift and in front of me, one of the DPS officers told Farrington that indeed they did have a picture of me.  Two of my friends were standing besides me during the course of this conversation and could easily confirm this point, and the picture itself was initially brought to my attention earlier in the night by two other friends who saw DPS holding the picture.  That DPS had a picture that night is easily verifiable by numerous witnesses.

That magical time of year has once again come and gone — the time when all the good street parking outside of Superior Grocers is taken by stretch limousines and low-flying choppers aren’t looking for fugitives, but a photo op instead.
Sensational · Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (pictured above) attended Sunday’s SAG Awards, which honored many previous big-name winners. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Yes, on Sunday, the venerable Shrine Auditorium played host to the 18th-annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, an industry event in which film and television actors celebrate one another’s work. By the time the SAG Awards roll around, all of the year’s Golden Globes, Critics’ Choice Awards and various guild prizes have already been handed out.
Taking place slightly under a month before the Oscars, the SAG Awards represent one of the last harbingers of things to come at the Academy Awards.
It’s interesting to see what kind of acting is finding favor with those who would presumably know the craft best — other actors.
But if this year’s wins are any indication, tastes don’t seem to be changing all that much from year to year. Of the six awards recognizing serialized primetime television, all but one went to the same actor or cast who picked them up last year.
Outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series was given to Boardwalk Empire for the second consecutive year. The prize in the equivalent category for comedy series was collected by Modern Family, also for the second year running.
These two awards are perhaps the most closely watched of SAG’s television categories, as they most often parallel the results of outstanding drama and outstanding comedy series in the Emmys — the most prestigious awards for TV.
Admittedly, a SAG Award is hardly a perfect indicator of who will win the corresponding Emmy — appraising a show’s cast is by no means the same thing as appraising the show itself. To evaluate a show through only the lens of acting is to disregard a spate of crucial considerations, most notably writing and directing.
So what are the SAG Awards good for, if not to help place informed bets for the Emmys?
In a perfect world, a person could respond to that question with a straight face and an answer along the lines of “for taking the pulse of the craft of acting.” But with a few notable exceptions, the awards handed out in television categories seemed to recognize flash over subtlety.
If SAG voters had any interest in asserting themselves as tastemakers, or in suggesting that — as actors themselves — they have some greater insight into what great acting truly is, they made some curious choices with Sunday’s awards.
By recognizing Steve Buscemi’s work on Boardwalk Empire with a win in the category of outstanding performance by a male actor in a drama series, voters took a decisive stand against the naturalistic style of acting practiced by Kyle Chandler in Friday Night Lights and Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad.
As far too few know, the late, great Friday Night Lights offered a portrayal of small-town life in East Texas that was staggeringly and gorgeously realistic. The show’s authenticity was owed in no small part to Chandler and his brilliant co-star Connie Britton’s incredibly naturalistic turns as Coach and Mrs. Taylor.
Similarly, AMC’s Breaking Bad, which takes place in Albuquerque, N.M., is made all the more real by Cranston’s simmering portrayal of the incredibly complex and unspeakably troubled Walter White.
By rewarding Buscemi’s comparatively less subtle performance as Nucky Thompson in Boardwalk Empire, SAG seems to suggest that gimmicks are in and real life is out.
Disappointingly, the award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a comedy series was an appropriately farcical affair. No disrespect meant to Betty White, but the 90-year-old’s win felt pointedly obligatory, particularly considering that she’s won her category every year since being named SAG’s Life Achievement Recipient in 2009.
Elka Ostrovsky, White’s character in Hot in Cleveland, is little more than a set piece that stands and spouts jokes, and although Modern Family is hardly in need of a cheering section, Julie Bowen’s spot-on performance as harried housewife Claire Dunphy was infinitely more deserving.
Like White’s, Alec Baldwin’s win for his embodiment of 30 Rock’s Jack Donaghy felt similarly inevitable: It was his sixth-consecutive year picking up the trophy for outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series.
And Jessica Lange, who accounted for the only new blood in the night’s awards for serialized primetime TV, received the trophy for her entrancingly anachronistic performance as aging Southern belle Constance Langdon in American Horror Story.
In this case, it wasn’t the sexagenarian’s body of work that justified an obligatory award.  Rather, for the second time that night, her fellow actors appeared simply to be indicating a preference for performances that tended toward the colorful rather than the understated.
Considering the slew of repeat victories, it’s unsurprising that nothing earth-shattering resulted from Sunday’s SAG Awards. But next year, voters would do well to put aside the popularity contest and recognize those who do what only the best kind of actor can do — make the viewer forget that they’re acting at all.

Has Ingrid Michaelson grown up?
Considering that Michaelson’s old lyrics included cutesy lines such as If you are chilly / Here, take my sweater — which landed her an Old Navy commercial, by the way — the answer seems to be a resounding yes.
On her fourth studio album, Human Again, Michaelson puts her ukulele up on the shelf and takes a stab at a more mature, less pop-influenced sound. Though the album’s sound is indeed more adult, it doesn’t live up to the grim elements she claimed would characterize this album.
Despite the changeups — including the obvious lack of ukulele — Human Again doesn’t have too much of anything new to offer listeners, particularly those looking for something fresh in the singer-songwriter niche.
The album starts off with the appropriately titled “Fire,” a fairly sophisticated song with a fast enough tempo to make it lively, but not overly bubbly. It’s easily the catchiest song on the album — probably why it’s first — and it uses a pleasant medley of instruments led by piano and a delicate, urgent violin, which would have been wise to incorporate within the rest of the album.
But “Fire” is a misleading first track. It has a moody feel that is intriguing and engaging, but Michaelson does not fully explore and expand on that tone with subsequent songs.
Instead, the album largely becomes mellow, with safe songs like “Ribbons” and standard piano ballads like “I’m Through.”
“Black and Blue” and “Palm of Your Hand,” at least, stand out in comparison to most of the songs on the album. “Black and Blue” has a precise, sultry rhythm while “Palm of Your Hand” features a chilled-out, guitar-driven catchiness.
But so few tracks cannot make the entire album interesting.
What’s most frustrating about this album is that despite Michaelson apparently being sick of her cutesy image and now wanting to share her dark secrets, she offers nothing profound on Human Again, and certainly nothing dark.
The melodies are largely predictable and the songs seem simple at first-listen because of Michaelson’s bluntness and comfort with her basket of metaphors, which is intriguing at times, but not when listeners crave something a bit deeper. The lyrics are standard fare; the majority of them are simply uninspiring relationship lyrics.
For example, in “How We Love,” Michaelson croons, We hate the rain when it fills up our shoes / But how we love when it washes our car.
And in “This Is War,” the chorus consists of the generic lines, You knock me out / You knock me down / And I will find my way around / This is war.
Michaelson doesn’t take full advantage of her position as a singer-songwriter to use her own words to genuinely move listeners and make them think. Her music has enough character to pique interest, but she runs the risk of being forever mushed into the conglomerate of slightly-above-mediocre singer-songwriters unless she can craft and deliver more intricate and engaging lyrics.
What’s most interesting about this album is how Michaelson has moved on from the gentle sweetness and upbeat pep of her past albums, showing that she has had some growth musically.
The first single off the album, “Ghost,” is a good example of this. It’s a rich, pensive, slow song that builds in energy by the second chorus and retains an element of gloominess throughout its duration. Michaelson has indeed branched out musically, even if her sound is still all part of the same tree.
Human Again is nothing fantastic, but it’s a decent sampling of Michaelson’s mild experimentation with a more mature sound. For old Michaelson fans, it’s an album that should certainly grow better with more listens. For most, the only thing that will keep it from being just another generic indie singer-songwriter’s album is Michaelson’s name, which is still fairly well-known.
Unfortunately, Human Again simply doesn’t offer enough actual compelling and sophisticated human emotion to warrant special attention.

The best part of Katherine Heigl’s new flick, One for the Money, happens before the movie starts:  It’s waiting in line for popcorn and a soda.
Crime comedy · Katherine Heigl (center) portrays a bounty hunter who must chase down a high-school fling. One for the Money proves unconvincing in every way, from Heigl’s performance to the undeveloped plot. - Photo courtesy of EPK.TV
In this sad adaptation of best-selling author Janet Evanovich’s novel of the same title, Heigl plays Stephanie Plum, a Jersey-dwelling lingerie saleswoman-turned-bounty hunter. Facing unemployment and possible eviction,  Plum is forced to approach her cousin Vinny to see if he has any openings at his bail bonds business. The job she gets isn’t what she expects: She winds up as a bail bonds enforcement agent, also referred to as a bounty hunter.
Curiously enough, her first bounty is for high school fling Joe Morelli (Jason O’Mara), a former cop wanted for murder. With the help of fellow bounty hunter Ranger (Daniel Sunjata), Plum manages to track down Morelli, but soon becomes entangled in a case that is much more complicated than she first believed.
To put it bluntly, the film fails to deliver on all fronts.
Sporting a lackluster brown hairdo and a drab wardrobe to match, Heigl comes across as painfully awkward and uncommitted in her portrayal of the supposed heroine. Though Heigl is an arguably decent actress with strong performances in movies such as 2007’s Knocked Up, she drowns in this film, failing to capture Plum’s wit, sass and pluck, which were conveyed in Evanovich’s novels.
Heigl’s performance is blasé, almost as if she knew the film would be a dud from the get-go but figured she might as well go through with it because she had already dyed her hair. To make matters worse, Heigl narrates the entire film in a sad attempt at a Jersey accent that sounds disinterested and almost sleepy in its delivery.
Heigl, however, is not the only actor whose subpar performance catapults the film into D-minus territory. Her “romantic interest” Morelli, played by the usually charming Irish-born Jason O’Mara, suffers from a similar disinterest and disengagement with his character — not to mention that the intended spark between Heigl and O’Mara is practically nonexistent, making the attempt at on-screen chemistry almost comical. The idea of the two having a steamy high-school fling seems light years away in One for the Money, as they seem to barely know each other, much less have once slept together.
The only redeeming quality of the movie comes from Sunjata’s performance as Ranger, Heigl’s mysterious mentor and fellow bounty hunter. Sunjata lends a dimension of mystique and intrigue to his character that surfaces in the few fleeting moments of on-screen excitement.
Curiously, Heigl and Sunjata have more on-screen chemistry than Heigl and O’Mara as her intended romantic interest. It’s surely an unintended effect that could have gone toward salvaging the film if their relationship had been spotlighted in the script instead of the one between Heigl and O’Mara.
Despite mediocre performances on nearly all accounts, One for the Money’s failure isn’t entirely the actors’ fault. The script is disjointed and lacks any sort of measurable story arc, instead playing out onscreen as a weaker and more long-winded television show than a feature-length film.
This might be because director Julie Anne Robinson seems to dabble with an episodic film structure, but the additional lack of motivation in performances and the absence of a uniting sense of purpose is inexcusable.
The film seems more like a series of unimportant events that are never really tied together. Additionally, the dialogue is perplexingly forced and unnatural. It serves to further annoy the audience instead of providing any insight, dimension or likability to the characters.
One for the Money is ironically labeled a “comic thriller” — the film wavers unsteadily between  comedy and thriller, but it is never funny or thrilling enough to merit the title of either.
If you are — for whatever reason — considering seeing One for the Money, it simply isn’t worthwhile.

With reruns and new episodes of at least five different cake shows — Ace of Cakes, Wedding Cake Wars, Cupcake Wars, Cake Boss, and Ultimate Cake Off — available for your everyday consumption, it feels like television has hit a new low.
More and more Netflix queues and DVRs are filling up with the likes of Mad Men, The Wire and Homeland while the Oscars are struggling to generate significant buzz.  In fact, many consider the present a golden age of television as a medium.
Not that the medium doesn’t have issues.
“I don’t need a show about cakes,” former television executive James Andrew Miller said last week at the Museum of Contemporary Art’s discussion, “Is This the Golden Age of Television?”
“It’s so derivative,” Boston Globe columnist Joanna Weiss said, seeming to agree with Miller’s most definitive statement of the night. “But 45 minutes later, I’m sitting there watching them spread frosting on the cupcakes.”
The back-and-forth was reflective of the four-person panel moderated by KCRW radio host and Daily Beast columnist Kim Masters, which struggled to assess a television landscape where cable television dramas can match the production value and acting of any Hollywood movie, but are often outdrawn on a weekly basis by shows such as the Jersey Shore and the Real Housewives of Orange County.
Occidental College professor and historian Thaddeus Russell and Homeland producer and writer Meredith Stiehm rounded out the panel at MOCA’s Ahmanson Theatre, but could no more come to a conclusion than Weiss and Miller could.
Russell stresses the changing landscape of both televisions demographics and distribution methods, saying that the present truly is a golden age for the medium if the viewer “valued diversity and choice.”
And Stiehm, who worked on shows such as Beverly Hills, 90210, NYPD Blue and Cold Case prior to producing and writing for the critically acclaimed Homeland, notes the increased choice today’s television programming offers to the viewer, especially on cable networks.
“It’s harder on the networks [today],” Stiehm said. “Networks have gotten more conservative. [Cable has] lots of new places to go.”
Weiss recognizes the opportunity that television — especially cable television — provides its producers, noting television’s ability to draw out characters in a “leisurely way” and not have to bring character development to a close in the constraints of a two-hour movie.
“Television is an opportunity as a writer to make something interesting,” Weiss said.
Miller, on the other hand, isn’t quite as convinced that today’s shows are reflective of a true paradigm shift toward television. He describes the period between 1971 and ’81 as a “quantum leap” that exceeded today’s product.
“Television is just not as compelling as it used to be,” Miller said. “Every single night was an event. I don’t see [the present] as a game changer.”
It certainly is difficult for every night to be an event in the current landscape, Russell later pointed out, as the average household now receives 118 channels as compared to the just seven it received in 1971, Miller’s perceived “quantum leap” start year.
The panelists ran into the question of whether the discussion they were having, or perhaps the exaltation of some of these highbrow shows, left out the average viewer and whether these viewers truly saw television as the gold standard of entertainment.
The recent explosion of attention paid to PBS’s Downton Abbey provided some easy fodder in the area.
“If you think all television should be PBS, you are in the .01 percent,” Russell said. “You are Mitt Romney.”
Stiehm recounted her time on the tail end of 90210 and during NYPD Blue’s heyday and stated that writing for the medium is difficult whether you’re writing “good” or “bad” television.
“Television does not demand quality,” Stiehm said, quoting NYPD Blue creator David Milch, “but it doesn’t preclude it, either.”

If the lines of racial oppression were unclear before, after Voices from the Black Diaspora, they blurred even more.  This past Saturday at the McClintock Theater, the latest Visions and Voices event explored the diverse narratives arising from Australia, America, and England, unifying varying experiences of black oppression while distinguishing differences in culture.
Typically, the African Diaspora describes the historical migration of Africans to different regions of the globe and the resulting development of dissimilar cultures. However, Saturday night explored something different – the Black Diaspora.
Directed by Philip Akin and Anita Dashell-Sparks, assistant professor of theater practice, the event featured scenes from three plays which provided unique perspectives on race. After the performance, there was a short Q&A session with the playwrights. Akin, also the director of several other prestigious black theatrical productions, served as mediator.
Writer Kwame Kwei-Armah, whose exceedingly elegant words of wisdom charmed the house, defined the Black Diaspora as the political and social sprawling of culture and identity. The new term expands the definition to peoples who were derogatorily labeled “black” by their society even if they didn’t necessarily identify with African culture.
“There is an African Diaspora narrative and a Black Diaspora narrative,” said writer Kwei-Armah of Black Grenadian descent. “Tonight was representative of a Black Diaspora.”
Available, written by Ethiopian artist Alemtsehay Wedajo, explored the challenges of preserving Ethiopian beauty and culture in modern American society. Kwei-Armah’s Elmina’s Kitchen highlighted the social and moral hardships of people of British, Black and West Indian descent. And, Stolen, written by Jane Harrison of Muruwari heritage, shed light on the fractured lives of the children of the Stolen Generation in Australia. 
The complex emotional content of each play was a bit much to be broken down into 30-minute scenes, but at the very least, audiences were able to begin to understand the messages of cultural identity.
“Being Ethiopian in America means sort of hiding our culture and tradition,” said Wedajo of her play Available. She smiled as she recalled the positive critical reception from performances past.
“The response from the audience was great, and I was grateful and very happy,” she said.
Voices from the Black Diaspora was presented “black-box style,” which meant that a small audience was up close and personal with a stage composed of minimal set design. Subtle shifts in lighting were used to convey changes in mood and the phenomenal actors had to adopt alternating accents and personas to denote changes in character.
Victoria Telford, who played Qelemuwa in Wedajo’s Available, gave a convincing and hilarious portrayal of a uniquely beautiful Ethiopian woman trying to conform to an American “Barbie” ideal. Ramon Deocampo, of Harrison’s Stolen, gave a particularly moving performance as a lost aboriginal child whose search for his mother stretches over 26 years and ultimately leads to his suicide. The differences of characters only served to expand the difficulties of racial sufferings across gender and cultural lines.
“There is a common way we write out narratives into ourselves and into anyone else who is willing to listen,” said Kwei-Armah, who had characters who spoke in a variety of accents and represented different cultures.
Kwei-Armah’s play Elmina’s Kitchen, set in England, featured several different accents ranging from British to Caribbean as well as Black-British slang, some of which went over the heads of audience members. Kwei-Armah, however, understood the disconnect.
“If you don’t understand a word [in my work], look for the next line,” said Kwei-Armah. “I was really proud of [the way I wrote the script.]”
But while Kwei-Armah accepted the American distance of his audience, Harrison’s Stolen was a bit harder to understand. Revolving around the Stolen Generations of the twentieth century, the specifics of the play were a bit difficult to comprehend without historical context. Nevertheless, audiences empathized with the loss and identity crises of the characters.
“People find some element they can relate to,” said Harrison, when questioned about the reception of Stolen.
Those who attended Voices from the Black Diaspora certainly didn’t waste a Saturday night. The thought-provoking speakers, enlightening scenes and well-developed characters affirmed the presence of black culture across the globe, challenging centuries of discrimination in a little less than two hours.
As for writers Kwei-Armah, Wedajo and Harrison, it is certain that their works changed the representations of racial discrimination for good.

Goldman Sachs, Google, Apple and Walt Disney.
These are just a handful of potential employers that many USC students clamor to work for after graduation. But job competition at these companies is incredibly fierce, with hundreds of résumés flooding in for a single opening.
What do they all have in common? They’re all for-profit companies.
As for-profit organizations steal the limelight, the non-profit sector is often left in the shadows.
Students might not realize that the non-profit sector isn’t just for do-gooders: It offers better prospects.
The non-profit sector has consistently added jobs in the past decade. According to a recent study from Johns Hopkins University, nonprofits have added jobs at an annual average rate of more than 2 percent from 2000 to 2010. And for-profit jobs were cut by an average of 0.6 percent each year.
Students who are struggling to find jobs in a competitive and narrow job market should expand their job searches to the non-profit sector.
After retail and manufacturing, nonprofits comprise the third largest private employers in the United States.
The breadth of non-profit organizations available is also impressive, spanning areas such as education, the arts, health and microfinance.
Besides the fact the non-profit sector is adding jobs, non-profit jobs provide new graduates with great opportunities for growth. In comparison with for-profit sector jobs that often have strictly defined roles, a typical job position at a nonprofit involves a variety of responsibilities.
To keep running, nonprofits require various activities, such as fundraising, donor management, program development and budgeting. They also hire fewer people to carry out those activities. Therefore, new graduates thrust into a non-profit job can develop diverse skills sets.
Another attractive characteristic of the non-profit sector is employers’ tendencies to value all majors. Though many for-profit companies recruit students from specific majors, such as finance or computer engineering, nonprofits look for broad skill sets, such as the ability to multi task and manage concurrent projects.
Students who finish non-profit programs are highly sought after by graduate programs and employers because of the leadership and management skills they cultivate. For example, Teach for America partners with prestigious companies like Bain & Company and J.P. Morgan, as well as graduate programs like Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.
The non-profit sector is not for everyone, and it has its flaws. Lower salaries often deter graduates. After taking a position at a nonprofit, it can be difficult for graduates to chart out where their careers are heading. Finally, because nonprofits often fall victim to inefficiencies, changes can take longer to implement, and it can be harder to benchmark success.
Nevertheless, the non-profit sector offers students a multitude of employment opportunities that they might not have initially considered or explored. And, perhaps most importantly, employees can make a direct and positive impact on their communities — something that can be a lot harder to trace when working for a bigger corporation.
Though the economy is slowly improving, students have to be creative, proactive and open-minded in their job search. Along with expanding their range of opportunities, students can find jobs that suit them and that allow them to give back.

That’s awesome – but students aren’t paying 200k for a degree to work at a place that pays 40k per year.
I know right? As a business owner that makes 1.5 million a year, it isn’t my job to donate and help a disenfranchised population that would take millions & millions to improve its circumstances.

With college tuition continuing to rise with no guarantee for jobs after graduation, some prospective college students might choose alternative paths to education.
Because of the increase in costs, enrolling for a postsecondary education online has become an attractive option — not a last resort.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The virtual classroom experience provides a viable alternative that students can take advantage of to improve their desired skills.
Udemy, a company launched in 2010, provides an online platform that allows anyone to build online courses or to take courses geared toward their topics of interest. Instructors decide how much to charge for their courses, but many courses are free.
The website’s slogan, “Academy of You,” appeals to many students searching for accessible, affordable and personal education. Courses offered range from business topics to how to build a blog from scratch. Many competitive higher education institutions, such as University of Cambridge, Stanford University and UC Berkeley are already setting up classes on Udemy’s website.
Many universities have created their own websites similar to Udemy to provide virtual classroom learning experiences that stretch across academic fields. For example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published key presentations from various faculty and guest speakers to MIT World, a university website that provides anyone with access to a free online education.
Participants in these online programs are not the only beneficiaries. By combining classroom experience with a high-quality education from top universities and bringing those components to the Internet, many American colleges have found an innovative way to brand themselves.
Based on a recent study conducted by Google, around three billion people will have access to the Internet in four years. That is nearly 50 percent of the world’s population. There is no reason education should not follow.
But, this new form of teaching — through sharing free videos online, created by anyone -— inevitably raises concerns about its prestige and legitimacy. In the context of the job search process, new college graduates should keep in mind how employers would value and perceive experience from an online learning program instead of a traditional, campus-based, college education.
Free online lectures have specific learning objectives that interest a targeted learning group. These online videos provide engaged learners with the skills recruiters are looking for.
Last week, a Wall Street Journal article “No More Résumés, Say Some Firms,” said that many recruiters have changed their habits. They now read résumés from the bottom up. Compared to their educational background, candidates’ early work experience, hobbies and special skills often provide more insight into how well an applicant would fit into a company’s culture. In fact, many large and mid-sized companies use applicant-tracking systems for résumés to search for the specific skills they desire.
Updated technology hasn’t just changed our daily lives; it has also prompted education reform.
And though online learning programs might not fully supplant traditional on-campus education, in this economic environment, having taken an online class might make all the difference to one’s job prospects.

On a all in cost basis UC Berkeley is the most expensive public university in USA. Foreign student tuition at UC Berkeley (UCB) is subsidized in the guise of diversity while instate student tuition/fees are doubled. UCB Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau displaces Californians qualified for public UCB with a $50,600 payment from foreign students.
UC Berkeley is not increasing enrollment. Birgeneau accepts $50,600 foreign students and displaces qualified instate Californians (When depreciation of assets funded by Californians are in foreign and out of state tuition calculations, out of state and foreign tuition is more than $100,000 +  and does NOT subsidize instate tuition). Like Coaches, Chancellors Who Do Not Measure Up Must Go: remove Birgeneau.
More recently, Chancellor Birgeneau’s campus police deployed violent baton jabs on students protesting Birgeneau’s tuition increases. The sky will not fall when Birgeneau and his $450,000 salary are ousted. Opinions make a difference; email UC Board of Regents   marsha.kelman@ucop.edu

Sunday marked marked the premier of the first non-teaser trailer for season two of Game of Thrones, HBO’s hit new fantasy series based on the books by George R. R. Martin. It was worth the frantic page refreshing – from Joffrey pointing a crossbow at Sansa to the Hound bashing someone’s face in with a morning star, it looks like a swanky new season. Season two will also mark the return of Peter Dinklage as the snarky dwarf Tyrion Lannister. Dinklage won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the role.
The trailer had another star: the sets, spanning the series’ capitol city to the frigid north beyond the Wall. Though still filming in Northern Ireland, this season film crews hoofed it to Iceland and Croatia, two countries with tremendous natural beauty but relatively little film action.
Kings Landing, the seaside capitol city of Westeros, found a real-life replica in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Dubrovnik is unusual – it possesses the balmy beauty of a Mediterranean city, but also features towering walls from the Middle Ages. With walls pre-built and spanning almost two kilometers, camera crews have the perfect set for the massive naval and land battle at the end of Clash of Kings, the book season two follows. The Croatian government has been very supportive of filming and hopes the season brings more tourism to Dubrovnik.
Season two also features Jon Snow and the Night’s Watch riding north to face the White Walkers. The crew found the frigid beauty they needed in Iceland, specifically the Svinafellsjokull calving glacier. The crew relied on a local film company, Pegasus Pictures, to scry for fresh snowfall – 2010’s volcanic activity left some of the glaciers sooty. Ultimately, the snow came, and the set pictures look perfect for the icy north.
In film, sets can often become a entire character. The job of a location scout is crucial, both to find the best sets and to balance aesthetic appeal with budget. Films, however, can often boost interest in a country. For this reason, Croatia and Iceland both offer discounts and rebates for film production crews. Peter Jackson made New Zealand known as the Land of the Hobbits for people who couldn’t find it on a map. Perhaps Game of Thrones will bring similar notice to Northern Ireland, Croatia and Iceland.

Stones Throw Records has partnered with Drip.fm to offer customers another avenue for listening to the label’s newest releases. For a charge of $10 per month, joining members will receive every record, EP and single released by Stones Throw after the time a subscriber signs up.
Stones Throw will deliver releases to the customers’ inbox, allowing subscribers to download the music at any time. The most notable part of this deal is that the music made available to subscribers will be released as ‘DRM-Free’ files.  DRM stands for digital rights management. DRM is a method of protecting music copyrights on digital files after a sale has taken place to limit the use and potential outside distribution of files. In its simplest terms, DRM music files are sold with an encrypted lock on them to prevent the extent of their use. DRM is employed by major music providers including Apple, Amazon and Sony, among others, and is an issue that has caused great controversy in recent months.
Fortunately for those interested in Stones Throw’s service, there is no need to worry about DRM restrictions.
Stones Throw Records was founded in 1996 by Chris Manak who assumes the stage name Peanut Butter Wolf when he’s not busy running one of (if not) the most respected hip-hop record labels. Stones Throw is based out of Los Angeles with headquarters located in the Los Feliz area of LA.
Stones Throw has been home to an immensely influential roster of hip-hop and R&B groups including J Dilla, Madlib, MF Doom and Aloe Blacc.
Though this monthly subscription service appears to be a steal for Stones Throw loyalists and newcomers alike, Manak doesn’t believe that it will replace traditional methods of acquiring his label’s music. Manak said to NPR, “We’re not trying to make this our main focus… You can still get our music through iTunes — a lot a people get it that way, and we’re happy that they do. You can buy vinyl, you can listen to it on YouTube for free … Whatever, it’s your choice. We’re just giving the customer another option.”
For those already familiar with Stones Throw, the new subscription service seems like a cheap way to stay involved, and for those just discovering Stones Throw, it will be a great way to get involved.
