Students erected a mock wall Monday symbolizing the barrier between Israel and the West Bank as part of Palestine Awareness Week, which is sponsored by USC’s Students for Justice in Palestine. The wall, which stands in the Von KleinSmid Center Courtyard, is inscribed with information about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
TEAR DOWN THAT WALL MR. RIGHT WING PSYCHO ISRAELI.!
Fight on, Israel, we do no wrong– to anyone, ever!
Palestinians are not people, after all, they are just an obstacle in the way of our plans to get rid of all of them, by taking everything they ever had. Get out of the way Palestinians, this is Israel. Oh, you won’t move voluntarily, okay let’s imprison you behind a wall and create the largest series of ghettos known to man. After all, we know what great nation makers ghettos are–we lived in them under the Nazis.
Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. Oh, and will the US please pay for all of it. Not a request.
Happy Passover to the citizens of the world;  don’t forget Israel is your ONLY friend in the Middle East.
No interviews, no more information?
Man, how does Hillel get you to print these lengthy propogandistic articles and the poor Palestinians get one lousy paragraph. Not too interested in presenting their side of the story–same ole D.T.
Really lousy journalism coming from the top of the D.T.. Really lousy and biased.
SO true

Currently on a five-match winning streak, the No. 4 USC women’s sand volleyball team will look to continue its success at home against defending national champion and current No. 1 Pepperdine today at Merle Norman Stadium.
The Women of Troy (9-2) have momentum after two big home wins over top-10 teams on March 22. The first came against No. 5 Hawai’i in a match that USC won handily, 5-0. The second was more grueling, as the Women of Troy faced a stout opponent in No. 9 Nebraska, but they were able to outlast the Huskers in a 3-2 victory.
After USC posted two sweeps in the No. 4 and 5-ranked matches, Nebraska took the No. 3-ranked match and pushed USC’s No. 1-ranked pair of graduate student Stevi Robinson and junior outside hitter/opposite Kirby Burnham to three sets before the pair ultimately clinched the dual by defeating the Cornhusker’s Kelsey Robinson and Alexa Strange, 16-21, 21-18, 19-17, to give the team a much-needed boost heading into the match against the defending national champions.
Pepperdine (5-0) has yet to be defeated in this young season, although they have had a much lighter schedule than USC. The Waves are coming off a tough 3-2 road win against No. 2 Long Beach State in a rematch of the 2012 AVCA Collegiate sand volleyball national championship on March 21. After being down 2-0 early, Pepperdine battled back to win the match with three consecutive matches to win the dual.
The team score was tied at 2 after Pepperdine’s No. 1-ranked pair of Lilla Frederick and Kim Hill won their match in straight sets, and the dual was clinched in the No. 2-ranked match when the Waves’ duo of Lara Dykstra and Caitlin Racich swept their match to complete the comeback. The Waves’ win gave Long Beach State (5-1) its first loss of the season.
This dual against Pepperdine will be the toughest test yet for a much newer, less experienced USC team that has fared well against other top-ranked opponents this season.
“Coming into the season, we didn’t have a lot of beach experience,” USC head coach Anna Collier said. “It’s really been all about getting more competitions and experience under our belts.”
USC’s only losses this year have been to No. 3 Florida State (2-3) and No. 2 Long Beach State (2-3) and, in both cases, it took five matches to overcome USC.
“The rankings are separated by just a number of points,” Collier said. “Sometimes, that’s just the way the volleyball bounces.”
USC will really be put to the test in its next three matches, having to play Pepperdine twice and No. 2 Long Beach State, once with the final two matches on the road, away from the comfort of the brand-new Merle Norman Stadium, where the Women of Troy are 7-2 this season.
However, the “new kids on the block” will have the home sand advantage today and look to extend their winning streak in what would be an impressive upset. The first serve is set for 5 p.m. and the match can be tracked on the USC official athletic site.

This past season for USC men’s basketball was full of moments. There was the stunning overtime victory at UCLA in late January, and the long-awaited Galen Center court storming that followed the Trojans’ upset over No. 11 Arizona in the season’s final homestand.
Bittersweet · Senior point guard Jio Fontan’s return was a bright spot this season, but his presence was not enough to propel USC to a .500 record. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan 
In the end though, such moments proved to be fleeting. Those impressive wins turned out to be isolated bursts of stellar play that could never result in a consistently good basketball team.
This has been a team plagued by inconsistencies throughout the season. A team that started the season with Kevin O’Neill as its head coach and finished with longtime assistant Bob Cantu at the helm. The squad that couldn’t buy a basket during its nonconference struggles and ended up being jettisoned out of the Pac-12 tournament in the first round thanks to a series of defensive lapses.
The Trojans’ goal was to return to the NCAA tournament after a one-year absence, but this squad fell flat early and then fizzled out to finish the season. USC’s 14-18 record was miles ahead of 2011-12’s 6-26 debacle, but ultimately will (and should) be viewed as a disappointment.
It was evident from early-season practices that the Trojans were rife with talent. According to Cantu, any shot within half court was “pretty much in range” for junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell. Redshirt junior forward Dewayne Dedmon drew NBA scouts to the Galen Center with his 7-foot size and athleticism, while the 7-foot-2 junior center Omar Oraby’s post skills kept the scouts’ eyes on the court when Dedmon headed to the bench. The 6-foot-6 senior forward Eric Wise could muscle down low, while senior point guard Jio Fontan’s return after missing all of 2011-12 with a torn ACL was a comeback to pay attention to.
In college basketball, though, there are two factors that almost always trump talent: coaching and consistency. In both categories the Trojans were fatally deficient.
Curse-laden rants and benching players to make a point were staples of the O’Neill era. A fiery approach to coaching works to perfection when a team is winning, but it backfired during the Trojans’ five-game losing streak early in the season. The nadir was when O’Neill benched Terrell, arguably his most talented player, for all but the final minute of the Trojans’ 70-26 romp over UC Riverside. One  month later, though, O’Neill was ousted.
So, in came the up-tempo style of Cantu, promoted to the leading role after 11.5 years as an assistant under four different USC head coaches. After scoring more than 70 points only four times in the first 17 games under O’Neill, the run-and-gun Trojans put up 74 in their first game in the Cantu era, nearly pulling off the upset over No. 10 Oregon. The team as a whole embraced the new playing style under Cantu, averaging more than 71 points per game while going 5-3 in Cantu’s first eight games.
All of a sudden, the team was performing up to its talent level. Then, that insidious bug of inconsistency unleashed its bite. After racing out to a 15-point second-half lead in Berkeley against the conference’s hottest team in Cal, the Trojans fell apart and lost 76-68 to the Golden Bears. A week later, UCLA unleashed its revenge at the Galen Center, clobbering the Trojans 75-59 in front of USC’s largest home crowd all season.
The pendulum inexplicably swung the other way just three days after the UCLA loss, as the Trojans knocked off Pac-12 leader Arizona by scoring 89 points on 61 percent shooting. But, just like the four-game winning streak earlier in the conference slate, this scoring explosion was not a stepping stone, but an outlier.
The Trojans didn’t score more than 57 points in any of their final three games, losing twice. They upped it to 66 points in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament but were bounced by Utah. Exactly two weeks after stunning the Wildcats, the Trojans were one-and-done in Vegas.
Calling this year a train wreck would be going too far. That implies that the squad had high expectations to go along with its high aspirations. The Trojans were picked ninth in the Pac-12 preseason media poll. The parade of transfers — Wise, Terrell, Oraby, Ari Stewart and Renaldo Woolridge — made USC intriguing, but the Trojans were a Pac-12 sleeper at best.
Sadly, we’re human. We get caught up in the victories. We get excited, and we think of what could be. This squad performed at an elite level for a short window, but when it mattered most, the ‘Cantus’ were the ‘could-nots’.

Following UCLA’s 83-63 loss to Minnesota in the opening round of the NCAA tournament on Friday night, USC redshirt junior forward Ari Stewart tweeted the following:
“UCLA about to be right back in L.A. with us,” he said.
On the one hand, it served as an entertaining, harmless jab at the Trojans’ crosstown rival, which was leaving the Big Dance about as soon as it entered. But on the other hand, it served as yet another reminder: USC is in Los Angeles too. In fact, the program has missed out on the tournament and stayed in Southern California three times during the last four seasons. Its lone appearance was a First Four loss to VCU in 2011, certainly a quick exit. It hasn’t cracked the field of 64 since 2009.
That’s a rather sad state of affairs, no doubt. It’s irrelevancy, to say the least. Now you have a student body — with the exception of fifth-year architecture majors or seniors on a victory lap — that has yet to really see its men’s basketball team in the Big Dance. March in South L.A., once again, just isn’t mad. Students continue to pass through the University Park Campus gates without a care in the world in regard to men’s basketball — a disappointing trend, especially when you consider the hectic, exciting pace of the sport and its single-elimination postseason tournament that seemingly appeals to the college demographic.
Tell me teams like Florida Gulf Coast aren’t fun to watch this time of year.
It’s why the coming weeks become so critical for USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, as the search for USC’s next head coach remains underway. A miss on the next hire presents increasingly drastic consequences.  The program can’t afford to be absent this time of year. As a special report in February from this newspaper pointed out, revenue and attendance are suffering. Reported men’s basketball-related revenue from 2011-12 stood at $4.81 million, ninth among Pac-12 schools. In the last two seasons, average attendance at the 10,258-seat Galen Center stood at just 4,102.
It all screams disinterest, and staying home in March only compounds the problem. It’s hard to foster any sort of on-campus hoops culture when players are operating TV remotes to watch NCAA tournament games rather than suiting up to play in them. To combat disinterest, you need a team that’s regularly in the postseason. Haden’s task is finding a coach who can do as much consistently.
It almost goes without saying, but USC needs a coach who can turn the program into a perennial tournament team. That stands as the priority. You hear so often about home run hires for USC basketball, the sleeping giant in the nation’s second largest city. But really, at present, this program needs a steady hand, if anything. It’s had too many good seasons over the last decade followed by disappointing, if not disastrous, ones.
It’s why names like Dana Altman make sense. To be clear, this isn’t a suggestion that Haden should hire the Oregon coach, who probably isn’t leaving Eugene, but a suggestion that someone like Altman makes sense.
For a quick profile: He’s 54 years old. He has led Oregon to the Sweet 16 in his third season with the program. The Ducks also won the Pac-12 tournament this month. Previously, at Creighton, he took the Bluejays to the NCAA tournament seven times. There isn’t much flash from the plain-spoken Nebraska native. Nothing fancy. Simply, he’s coached plenty of winning basketball teams over the years.
That’s the portfolio USC so desperately needs. It needs someone, anyone, to make college basketball relevant on this campus. It isn’t a secret formula tucked away in some cupboard. It’s as simple as finding a coach to get the program dancing every March.
So, perhaps cool the talk of the big-name hire or someone with local ties or someone who will install an up-tempo style of play. Why all the little bonuses? How about just hiring a good basketball coach?
USC basketball needs to learn to walk before it can run. Forget the Elite Eight and the Final Four. Let’s see if the Trojans can in fact play in March and return to the NCAA tournament. Let’s maybe start with that.

In an extremely competitive championship meet, USC senior Haley Anderson and sophomore Haley Ishimatsu took home three individual titles, while the No. 1 Trojans placed seventh overall at the 2013 NCAA women’s swimming and diving championships in Indianapolis.
Finishing strong · Redshirt sophomore diver Haley Ishimatsu took home her first career NCAA title in a record-setting performance. — William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Anderson secured USC’s first-ever NCAA title in the 1650-yard freestyle with a time of 15:45.98 on the final night of the meet and captured her second-straight NCAA crown in the 500-yard freestyle on the first night.
Ishimatsu ran away with the platform title behind her NCAA record 396.75 points on night three and became the third Trojan to win an NCAA diving title.
The Women of Troy finished with 291 points in a field of 40 schools to land in the NCAA top seven for the fourth-straight year. In both of the previous two years, USC placed third overall.
Georgia won the team title with 477 points, while California, which had its two-year title streak snapped, finished second with 393.
In the 1650-yard freestyle final, Anderson fought off Sarah Henry, the top seed from Texas A&M, who pulled within 0.81 with 50 yards remaining. Anderson ultimately took the win by 0.43.
“I knew [Henry] could finish hard, so I was trying to stay as far ahead as I could over the last 100,” Anderson said. “It would have been nice to go faster, but it’s all about the win and all about getting the points for the team.”
Ishimatsu, on the other hand, left her competition in the dust with her record-setting performance, winning by 68.15 points. She capped off her first career title with a two-and-a-half back somersault, one-and-a-half twist pike to score 84.80 points in her final dive.
“My confidence going in was good compared to springboard because platform is my event, and it’s what I’ve done my whole career, so it was really nice to perform well tonight,” Ishimatsu said. “My goals were to do the dives like I was practicing and focusing on one dive at a time and the end result would be there, and I did that.”
Ishimatsu now joins her sister, Victoria, as one of three Trojans with an NCAA diving title. Ishimatsu also won platform titles in the 2013 Pac-12 and NCAA Zone E Championships.
“It was awesome. She performed every dive up to her standard and at her very best,” USC head diving coach Hongping Li said. “It was great to see her put everything together, which is not easy under pressure.”
Along with Anderson and Ishimatsu’s efforts, sophomore Andrea Kropp and freshmen Jasmine Tosky and Kendyl Stewart all made final appearances on the last night of the championships.
Stewart placed fourth in the 200-yard backstroke finals, setting personal and school records with a time of 1:51.28. She also tied for first in the 100-yard fly consolation final on Friday.
After placing first in the 200-yard fly prelim, Tosky took fifth in the 200-yard fly with a 1:55.11 time and clinched her first NCAA individual points.
Kropp set a personal record in the 200-yard breast prelim and finished seventh in the final. She was also a consolation finalist in the 200-yard individual medley.
In the first night of the championships, juniors Stina Gardell and Meghan Hawthorne finished fourth and eighth, respectively, in the 200-yard individual medley finals, while junior Kasey Carlson placed seventh in the 50-yard freestyle relay.
Though the Women of Troy collectively had strong performances, the team took a hit in the standings after its 400-yard medley relay was disqualified for a violation.
“We found out in a tight meet we can’t have any mistakes, and that relay on the first day kind of cost us a little bit,” USC head coach Dave Salo said. “But the women did a great job coming back, and I’m really proud of their effort.”
On night two, Carlson also placed second in the 100-yard breast, while Gardell took fourth in the 400-yard individual medley. USC’s 200-yard medley and 800-yard freestyle relay teams both placed sixth.
“It was the tightest meet we’ve seen in probably six years or so, and if we do a little bit better here, a little bit better there, we have a good chance at another top-three finish,” Salo said. “Overall, though, I think we’ve grown up a lot.”
This does not add up in my book. Ranked #1 supposedly, and finishes seventh overall in the ncaa. That to
me is a less than stellar performance. Double winner in Anderson plus a win in one of the diving events to
come in seventh best behind both Cal and Arizona of your own conference. Another mediocre coaching job
when it really counts. Maybe Johan Vavic should coach swimming while he directs the water polo team using
the same pool.

After spending their spring break in the Midwest, where they defeated Notre Dame and Illinois, the USC men’s tennis team hit the ground running back at home on Monday with a 6-1 victory over No. 14 Texas A&M to improve to 17-2 on the season.
Leading the way · Junior Emilio Gomez was stellar in Monday’s match against Texas A&M, winning his set against Jeremy Efferding 6-0, 6-1. The Trojans won all three doubles matches and all but one singles match. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans, ranked No. 3 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, were without the services of freshman phenom and former Pac-12 player of the week Max de Vroome, who was sidelined with a wrist injury.
The absence of de Vroome was hardly reason for panic, though, as USC cruised to pick up the doubles point behind the efforts of sophomore Roberto Quiroz and junior Emilio Gomez. The tandem of cousins from Guayaquil, Ecuador, dubbed “Team Ecuador” by USC head coach Peter Smith, was dominant in their fifth outing since Smith re-configured the doubles teams. Though the pair has yielded results, Smith was hesitant to about possible future pairings.
“I hope [the change is permanent]. If they lose their chemistry, they lose their partnership,” Smith said. “They’re good enough to win, we know that, but it’s about having the right mindset. They’re doing a great job.”
Gomez also led the way in singles, punishing the Aggies’ sophomore and top player Jeremy Efferding in a straight-sets victory that was very one-sided. Efferding, ranked No. 52 singles player in the nation by the ITA, struggled mightily against the icy, domineering play of Gomez.
Gomez played heavy, launching forehands deep and practically repainting the deep corners with screaming forehand winners. At the end of four games in the first set, the beleaguered Efferding’s shirt was drenched in sweat. The Aggie sophomore would fight valiantly throughout but would ultimately succumb, 6-0, 6-1, in a match that lasted 72 minutes.
“I was playing really heavy [and] waiting for my shots,” Gomez said. “I think this was one of my best matches of the whole year.”
Gomez’s fellow ITA top-10 teammate and junior captain Ray Sarmiento had a similar result in his match, but an unorthodox opponent in Texas A&M junior Junior Ore. Ore employed a variety of spin-heavy shots and a monstrous first serve in an attempt to confuse Sarmiento, who remained unfazed.
“[Ore] goes for a lot of his shots, but he’s pretty erratic,” Sarmiento said. “I used my slice really well and got him on his backhand. I looked to come in [towards the net] and it worked pretty well.”
Sarmiento neutralized the spin on the shots with his slice and outlasted Ore with superior footwork and by forcing the Aggie into difficult positions. At one point Ore, standing just behind the service box, fell to the floor chasing three separate defensive volleys until Sarmiento struck a cold-blooded passing shot into open space for a winner as Ore looked on from the ground.
Fan favorite sophomore Jonny Wang filled in at the No. 6 position for the sidelined de Vroome and looked comfortable in his role. After being down by two games in the second set, Wang fed off the energy of his supporters to climb back and dispatch Aggie sophomore Jordan Szabo in straight sets 6-2, 7-5.
“It felt pretty good. I tried to pump myself up, especially when I got down in the second set,” Wang said. “That really helped me come back strong and finish the match.”
Wang’s fellow sophomore Yannick Hanfmann started slow but finished strong to wrap up play on Monday with a victory over Texas A&M freshman Harrison Adams, 3-6, 6-3, 1-0 (10-8).
The win was the team’s fifth straight since losing at home to rival UCLA and, with only seven matches remaining until the postseason, USC appears to be clicking at the right time.
The Trojans will continue their 2013 campaign for an unprecedented fifth-straight NCAA team championship with a visit to Northern California, where they open up official Pac-12 Conference play in matches against Stanford and Berkeley on Friday and Sunday, respectively.

The newest edition to the slate of Japanese noodle restaurants in Little Tokyo is Tsurumaru Udon, located on the third floor of the Little Tokyo Shopping Center. Unlike some noodle restaurants, Tsurumaru offers quick service and customizable udon bowls at affordable prices. Not only that, but Tsurumaru makes its own udon noodles and even makes premium toppings fresh after an order is placed. Simply put, the restaurant provides many different choices that will satisfy both meat lovers and vegetarians alike.
The most intriguing part about this restaurant is it has an ordering system similar to an assembly line. Once a customer steps in, the customer chooses the size of their udon and soup base. If a customer is ever confused, there is a large sign at the front that shows customers how to order.
At Tsurumaru, the customer can order their udon for about $5. Similar to options at other noodle restaurants, Tsurumaru’s soup bases and udon noodles can be served either hot or cold. The whole process is very straightforward and allows the customer to see the food being created as they order.
After a customer selects a soup base and size, the customer can watch as the Udon chefs loosen the udon and place it in a nicely decorated bowl. The cook then pours soup on top of the udon, after which  the customer then takes their plate and move on to the topping bar. There one can pick out a number of regular toppings (green onion, tofu and seaweed, for instance) as well as some premium toppings, which are made to order so they retain their fresh taste. These toppings include freshly made tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) and tempura.
A customer pays a flat rate for a portion of regular toppings, while the premium toppings are paid for by the piece. After the desired plate is selected, one can head to the cashier to pay and then take a seat on one of the wooden chairs facing a glass windowpane, letting diners people-watch if they so desire. After the meal is finished, follow a large sign that points to a tray area where trays and empty bowls are returned— no mess, no fuss.
Along with the udon, there are also many side dishes; one highlight is the Japanese rice balls, or onigiri. Unlike the store-bought ones that are usually very chilled, the onigiri here are prepared hot and fresh, providing a great complement no matter what type of udon you order. And the cost for a complete meal isn’t overwhelming: For about $10, one can get a regular niku udon bowl with three toppings — the restaurant is generous with each — as well as an onigiri on the side.
Many Japanese restaurants are closed during lunch hours and open during dinner hours, or have some sort of break between the two dining periods. Thankfully, Tsurumaru is open from 11 a.m to 9 p.m. and also delivers, giving students around USC a convenient option when udon cravings strike. The restaurant tends to be mellow around 2 p.m. on weekdays, but the assembly-line approach works well in the event of a customer rush, which mostly happens during dinner hours.
The restaurant also features an open kitchen, allowing customers to see that the managers and employees are constantly checking the temperature and freshness of the ingredients. Overall, the restaurant is a hybrid of a food court and higher-end sit-down restaurant; it feels somewhat like a food court that happens to just have one booth. The customer benefits from not having to take a seat and wait for someone to come by, and the system also lets customers actively engage with the entire construction of the meal. In that way, Tsurumaru is the best mixture of on-the-go dining with the benefits of having a calm dining room in which to eat. Despite ordering in an assembly-line manner, the atmosphere at Tsurumaru does not feel rushed at all. The clean wooden floor and warm lighting create a relaxing dining environment.
Though the ambiance and service are top rate, some might find the soup to be a little salty, though that probably depends on that day’s preparation. However, the meat and the udon are both very well prepared. The beef, for one, is rich, and flavorful and provides a perfect counterpart to the star of the dish, the udon, which has a nice bite and is miles better than the frozen udon you might have had at home (or even at other restaurants).
Tsurumaru Udon has broad appeal, and for good reason. The food, service system and setting all combine to make an affordable dining experience that will appeal to cash-strapped students and udon lovers alike.

It was the news heard around the world — or rather, the fashion world. According to multiple sources, supermodel and Cat Daddy YouTube dancer extraordinaire Kate Upton would grace the cover of Vogue this upcoming June.
What did you say? June? Isn’t that a little ways off? Sure it’s only — gasp! — the end of March, but early May is right around the corner and soon the mailboxes of millions of people out there will be stuffed with what is most likely to be a provocative and sexy Upton Vogue issue.
Upton’s rise through the supermodel ranks has been nothing short of extraordinary. While she definitely hit the genetic lottery, Upton’s 33-25-36 measurements, platinum blonde hair and seductive beauty mark above her lip were basically a curse in the modeling world. When Upton received the honor of being the cover model for Sports Illustrated’s 2011 “Swimsuit Issue,” a booking agent for the Victoria’s Secret fashion show stated that Upton would never be in one of its shows or catalogues, since she has “the kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.”
Skinny Gossip, an online blog with tabs such as “Starving Tip of the Day” called Upton a “little piggy” and said that when she graces the runway she looks like she’s “confidently lumbering up the runway like there’s a buffet at the end of it.”
Classy.
Luckily, there are those who praise Upton’s fuller shape, which by average American statistics, is actually thin. In a world where the “norm” is considered being 5’10” and a size zero, Upton is a breath of fresh air, a light at the end of the tunnel.
This is a 21-year-old girl who has the power to change the world. It might sound a bit dramatic, yet it’s true. How many times have you heard someone who, while staring in the mirror, says “I’m fat”? How many times have you done that yourself?
Even though we might not give it much credence, what we see displayed in our magazines and in pop culture has a devastating influence on our lives. Constantly seeing skinny, waifish models, used for their bodies and not for anything else, will drill the image of perfection into young people’s heads. We will constantly aim for an idea of perfection that might not exist for us.
Yes, some of us are “lucky” and are born with the ability to eat three cheeseburgers and not gain a pound. I had a friend in high school who could literally eat the world Krishna-style and not look like anything other than a runway model.
The problem lies in the fact that so many girls are physically altering the way that they look to get down to this size. There is a huge difference between naturally being a size zero — these girls exist, I swear! — to being a bit larger but thinking that by starving and/or exercising, they can look like the models in the glossy pages of a magazine.
The second women and girls start trying to change their natural shape — one given to us by genetics — we start playing with human nature. Exercise and eating healthy are always ideal, but obsessing over ideas of perfection and thinness is a sickness in and of itself.
According to the Fashion Model Directory, Upton is a size four. And yet she is considered “curvy” and a role model for the average woman (by the way, the average woman in the United States is a size 14).
The Council of Fashion Designers of America is a nonprofit used as a guild for the top designers in the United States. A few years ago, President Diane Von Furstenberg and the CFDA released a new set of model guidelines. According to the statement, designers within the CFDA will “encourage models who may have an eating disorder to seek professional help in order to continue modeling” and “supply healthy meals, snacks and water backstage and at shoots and provide nutrition and fitness education.”
In the fashion world, models are routinely forced to work 12-hour days, surviving on nothing but cigarettes and Diet Coke. It’s unfortunate that water had to be in a set of guidelines.
Hopefully, an American Vogue cover would be a start. Upton has graced the cover of Vogue Italia, British Vogue and GQ. She was also featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue twice But what do all of these shoots have in common? She is shot as a blonde bombshell, sucking a lollipop and rolling around in the sand. Yes, Upton is sexy, but it’s time we see a different look on her.
By covering her up and putting her in actual clothes — ones that grace the runway and in spreads — Vogue would be showing the world that curvy can be fashion-forward, that there is no such thing as “one look.”
The world is filled with beautiful women whose sizes differ. I’m tired of seeing the same nameless model over and over again. It’s time for a change, and though size four is a revolution for the industry, perhaps it’ll set it on the track toward something actually … normal.

I think most girls just eat too much!  Try the salad instead without all the dressing and bacon bits…
I appreciate the tone you took in this article. Our obsession with looks and reality TV is getting too much to bear. Teenage girls are fixated on what they look like spending hours in front of their mirrors and taking photos of themselves. The only good thing about Kim Kardashian is the fact that she is not thin. That she has a booty and some meat on her bones.  Way to go Vogue. I too hope it sets a trend…
I found this quite interesting… especially after the situation with the mannequins in Sweden. I see Upton as the reincarnation of Marlyn Monroe, Upton is inspiring young girls to love themselves for how they are, just as Marlyn did at her time ( Until Twiggy arrived).
It is very difficult for young girls today not to compare themselves with Victoria Secret models such as Candice Swanpoel and Miranda Kerr… Upton brings a relief in those girls that are not a size 0 or a size 2.

It’s interesting when the circumstances surrounding the release of a new film are just as intriguing as the film itself. The latest from DreamWorks Animation, the prehistoric family adventure The Croods, has a lot at stake. Not only is this the first DreamWorks Animation film to be released through 20th Century Fox, but it’s also the production company’s first film since Rise of the Guardians, which disappointed at the box office and partly contributed to the company letting go more than 350 employees earlier in the year.
Caveman rock · A prehistoric family embarks on the world´s first family road trip in The Croods. Once the Croods are out of their cave, their uncivilized natures become pronounced. Be sure to catch the Trojan Marching Band in the opening sequence performing a remix of, what else, “Tusk.” — Courtesy of 2013 DreamWorks Animation LLC
That being said, when it comes to juding a film, it ultimately boils down to whether the film is worthwhile or not. And though there are issues with the character design and the unbalanced approach to the theme of the story, The Croods is saved by a genuinely heartwarming family dynamic, some wonderful creatures and a more jovial approach compared to past DreamWorks features.
The film, directed by Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch, How to Train Your Dragon and Kirk De Micco), is about the Croods, a modern Stone Age family living in a prehistoric world on the verge of change. The father, Grug (Nicolas Cage), is so overprotective of his family that the family spends days at a time in its cave, away from the outside world. Though the other family members are content with the father’s orders, the eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone) desperately wants to see the outside world.
One night she comes across Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a journeyman capable of making fire and tools, who warns Eep of an impending catastrophe that he calls “the End,” not an imaginative name, but a name that illustrates a charming aspect of the film — that everyone speaks with a childlike lack of subtlety and etiquette, something which makes the characters more sympathetic.
When an earthquake destroys their cave, the Croods must face a dangerous world to find a safe haven on the other side of the giant mountain in the distance. So, think The Land Before Time except with people rather than talking baby dinosaurs.
An issue with the structure of the plot is that each act seems to have a separate theme: The first act is about the father-daughter relationship between Grug and Eep, the second is about facing the dangers of the world while staying together as a family and the third focuses just on Grug’s effort to “evolve” in order to save his family.
The reason for this might have been because when the film was originally going to be an Aardman Animation production back in 2007, the plot was mostly about the conflict between Grug and Guy. Though this might be the fault of the film’s marketing, which seemed to place Eep as the lead, the shift in focus is unexpected.
The dynamic among the family keeps the film together. Once they’re out of the cave, the uncivilized wild nature of the different members is let loose, like the pudgy Thunk (Clark Duke), the feisty elder Gran (Cloris Leachman) and the ferocious toddler Sandy (Randy Thom). Even the relationship between Eep as Guy goes differently than other young romances, with Eep being the hyper-aggressive super-strong one in the couple and Guy as the startled one.
The world the family inhabits is a world gone wild. The concept design department really brings its A-game to the environments and creatures. Instead of just going with a Flintstones knock-off, the designers created something really interesting and unique.
There should also be a shoutout to the Spirit of Troy marching band, which colloborated with composer Alan Silvestri in an opening chase sequence that proved to be the highlight of the musical score.
It’s a shame, then, that the same inventiveness wasn’t used in the design of the main characters. Instead of just looking like cavemen, the attempts to make them look more “normal” are jarring, like their hyper-realistic eyes or the sharp cheekbones. The look of the characters is way too gentrified, especially Guy’s design.
If you don’t pay attention to that kind of detail, you won’t mind too much. For those who do pay attention to character design, however, no matter how much you end up liking these characters, it’s really hard to get over the flaws in their look. It’s more disappointing when you know Chris Sanders, whose character drawings are some of the most recognizable in the industry, is at the helm.
Looking past the character designs though, The Croods is an enjoyable family adventure with some great-looking animals and a more alternative take on the “modern Stone Age family” than other films in the genre.
It’s not clear if this film is the start of a new successful era for DreamWorks Animation or just another bump in the road for a company that’s already weathered several rough patches lately. Still, if you have a close-knit and partially crazy family, there’s plenty to like about The Croods.  And that likely connection with the audience might be this film’s true saving grace.

Few feelings are more unsettling than falling victim to a false sense of security. That is why many take comfort in fairy tales: No matter what stylistic liberties are taken, there is some solace in knowing that when the climax is reached, the main characters will live happily ever after.
All grown up · Jack (Matthew Magnusson), left, discovers what people need and what they want are two very separate things after he hooks up with Wolf (Andrew Crabtree), right, to make his flatmate jealous in Wolves. — Courtesy of Matthew Brian Denman
Wolves, a play written by Steve Yockey and directed by Michael Matthews, provides no such certainty. The play draws the audience into a story that they believe themselves to be familiar with — “Little Red Riding Hood” — but then throws viewers to the wolves, pun intended.
As any artistic work should do, Wolves successfully strives for originality. Yockey reimagines the forest as a big city, makes Little Red two young gay men and the wolf a misunderstood strong-silent type. Little Red is personified by Ben (Nathan Mohebbi) and Jack (Matt Magnusson), two 20-somethings new to the city who used to date but have since broken up. Financial difficulties force Jack to remain living with Ben in an apartment that quickly becomes crowded with sexual and emotional tension.
Aside from providing a contemporary twist that appeals to the West Hollywood venue’s demographic, switching the naive main character from a little girl to young gay men is not just daring but meaningful, as it shows that neither children nor grown men are safe from betrayals of trust.
The show makes clear that this hardship is an unavoidable experience that can occur at any time, without warning, even with those we trust the most. The story of Little Red Riding Hood tempts the horrible fear that those we think we know best are capable of hurting us the most. Despite knowing about Ben’s unstable mental state, Jack continues living with Ben because he believes he knows Ben inside and out — eerily similar to the way Little Red nearly dies at the hands of a wolf because she felt safe in her “grandma’s” presence.
Mohebbi, as Ben, superbly portrays the acute anguish that belies seeing an ex-partner return to the dating scene. Though Jack is charming enough, the character doesn’t quite inspire sympathy, especially when he disregards Ben’s fragility and brings home Wolf (Andrew Crabtree), a man whom Jack picks up at the local bar and hopes can satisfy the emptiness left in him by Ben. Of course, the expectations are not quite met.
Meanwhile, Ben’s paranoia reaches an all-time high. Mohebbi conveys Ben’s lack of control through soliloquies that are welcome insights into his damaged psyche rather than distractions. The music that introduces these solo speeches, however, along with the narrator’s asides to Ben, is far too ominous for its own good. Sound cues are useful tools to grab an audience’s attention, but they should not take away from the action itself.
The play’s omniscient redheaded narrator, played by Katherine Skelton, serves to further aggravate Ben’s anxiety. Her advice is initially only heard by the audience and Ben, almost as if she is an extension of the separation anxiety Ben suffers from. At first, the narrator is irritating with her lilting, overly wry tone. Once her purpose in the play becomes clearer, however, her comedic relief and commentary become necessary to balance out the heavy interactions among the men.
There seems to be a connection between the narrator and the fairy-tale figure of Little Red’s mother, a woman who sends her daughter out into the world, completely aware that it is a place filled with danger. Still, Yockey could have written the narrator in a way that would have been tied into the plot more creatively rather than just using her as an embodiment of the audience’s expectation of what the fairy tale is meant to be. Nonetheless, her presence serves as a useful connection between the audience and the players.
Another criticism is that, at certain points, the dialogue forces itself to be witty. Conversations occasionally felt contrived and, sometimes, Ben and Jack’s arguments are hard to follow because lines are messily layered in an attempt to recreate an actual argument. Whether this is an in-the-moment delivery choice on the actors’ part or a directional choice is unclear, but the arguments could have been portrayed with more precision while maintaining the genuine feel of the conversation.
The same problem occurs with Crabtree’s Wolf; he slowly becomes more bestial as the story progresses, but during the play’s climax, his growling is over-the-top. Though making wolfish sounds is no easy feat, Crabtree’s descent into canine fervor could be a little more terrifying rather than exaggerated.
Though some of the play’s symbolism becomes convoluted during the messy conclusion, Yockey and Matthews have ultimately constructed a play that satisfies the audience on a primal level. There’s sex, deception and plenty of oozing blood, and once the final blows are dealt and the red lights dim, the audience is left in silent awe.
And as far as relationships are concerned, Wolves is a reminder that people seek from others the stability they can’t find on their own. Jack wants Wolf to be someone he isn’t while Ben clings to the connection he once shared with Jack, who, of course, desperately seeks refuge from Ben’s needy grasp. The question of love versus need is prevalent and fits perfectly with the original Little Red Riding Hood theme of finding one’s inner strength.
The play shows that, no matter how difficult the situation, the strength to realize who you love and who you need is always there — you just have to listen to the right voice of reason. Even if that voice is coming from inside your head.
 
Wolves runs until May 5 at Celebration Theatre. Tickets are $30.

A Quinnipiac poll issued last week found that in a potential 2016 presidential matchup former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would crush former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush by 51-40 percent, a particularly shocking finding since Clinton is not currently a candidate for the 2016 election and because Florida is known as a generally conservative state. In fact, a Business Insider article from last week made headlines as it reported that several sources in the Republican Party were nervous about Clinton’s decision as well.
“If she runs, she’ll be almost impossible, I fear,” said one Washington-based Republican strategist.
Though it might be too early to start buying Hillary Clinton 2016 bumper stickers, the effects of a female president on business and economy may come as a surprise to many Americans. Clinton’s emphasis on recruiting more women into working positions has been clear throughout her time as Secretary of State and as a U.S. Senator, having heralded several programs for women in business.
As she famously stated, “When it comes to the enormous challenge of our time — to systematically and relentlessly pursue more economic opportunity in our lands — we don’t have a person to waste and we certainly don’t have a gender to waste.”
Since 2006, Clinton has endorsed the idea that women are an untapped economic resource in business and, if her campaign is successful in 2016, the role of women in the business sector could be permanently transformed.
With the dust from the 2012 presidential election finally settled, voters have already begun to call out for Clinton to throw her hat into the presidential ring in 2016. Premature support for Clinton’s campaign continued to grow after Clinton announced her resignation from the Secretary of State position. Though she has been noncommittal about presidential plans for the future, Clinton is arguably one of the best prospects for the presidency in the next election. And, if she chooses to run, she will be nearly impossible to beat.
Though her resume is nothing short of impressive, Clinton’s business tactics in politics set her even further apart from her political counterparts.
“We also understand that America’s economic strength and our global leadership are a package deal,” Clinton said. “Our power in the 21st century depends not just on the size of our military, but also on how we grow, how well we innovate, what we make and on how effectively we sell.”
Part of this growth, Clinton argues, is in the number of working women.
Clinton said that “there is no doubt that the increasing numbers of women in the economy has helped fuel significant growth everywhere. And economies that are making the shift more effectively and rapidly are dramatically outperforming those that have not.”
Clinton is not the only person to make the connection. A recent Catalyst survey found a strong correlation between gender diversity in the executive positions of a corporation and that business’ overall economic performance. As CNN analyst Brooke Burke argues, “If women’s economic potential can be successfully harnessed and leveraged, it would be the equivalent of having an additional one billion individuals in business and in the workforce contributing to the global economy.”
The results of this kind of thinking have already affected countries outside of the U.S. Avon, the cosmetic company, for example, gives millions of women in more than 100 countries the opportunity to become entrepreneurs, resulting in more than $10 billion in revenue. Within the United States, Walmart has opted to invest more than $20 billion in female-led companies in the United States alone. What these companies have discovered is that tapping into women as a resource has enormous financial incentives. According to the International Center for Research on Women, “investing in women is recognized not only as the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do.”
Clinton’s success in 2016 might not have effects on businesses in terms of financial policy, but the political impact of her win may be more compelling. Clinton has been a proponent of women in business for her entire political career, but it is only recently that her strategy of positioning women as an economic resource has come in to play. If the odds are in her favor in 2016, it is this ideology that might affect numbers of working women everywhere.

Cultural studies are vital
Cultural studies scholarship in our universities is on a decline. The discipline is underfunded, and is virtually unheard of amongst the general American public. It is not surprising, then, that our universities fragment cultural inquiry through specialization. Whereas distinguished international institutions such as the University of Amsterdam allot the discipline a single department and research centers, our universities force cultural studies scholars to be housed under various departments such as communication, English and film studies (as is the case at USC).
This reality threatens to suppress cultural studies scholars’ critical thought, by way of binding them to discursive arenas that might restrict the nature of their inquiries. This means that a practitioner of a discipline inquiring about cultural variables is limited in her ability to communicate her common concerns with a counterpart housed in another department. She will generally be confined to her department’s theoretical groundwork, even if her true inclination leans towards interdisciplinarity; likely because she is dependent on grants specific to her department. As a result, the study of culture in America is not only studied in fragments, but intellectual exchange amongst its scholars is both hindered and limited to different fields.
The solution to the fragmentation of the study lies in convergence, as put forth in the European model, through the creation of cultural studies departments in our universities. Conducting all cultural inquiry via one discipline might also put an end to cultural studies critics’ number one claim — that it lacks scientific method. Alas, these critics rarely fail to point out that the discipline is unstructured, making it difficult to hold researchers accountable for their claims. Yet, their criticism fails to address the likelihood that this so-called lack of structure directly results from the very fact that the field is scattered throughout a smorgasbord of disciplines; which hinders any real chance at fostering a solid disciplinary methodology. Furthermore, cultural studies as a discipline — at its core -— is structured in its interdisciplinarity between the humanities and social sciences, which makes it vital for its scholars to be housed under one roof in order for researchers to properly communicate, collaborate and theorize.
A common failure to understand “culture” as a holistic and multifaceted concept might be at blame for this widespread ignorance, the correction of which is essential in improving the status quo of the field. It seems that the majority of people wrongly define culture dichotomously as being either high culture (opera), low/popular culture (reality TV), or both. Cultural studies intelligently approaches culture as fluid, as prevalent in everyday life, and as directly linked to notions of politics and responsible citizenship.
On these grounds, individuals should understand culture as all the way(s) in which human beings create meaning and identities within the framework of their society. By way of this definition, cultural studies invaluably aims to find out how a particular medium or message relates to ideology, social class, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality and/or gender. It studies the meanings and uses people give to practices of everyday life and cultural artifacts.
This could be any cultural product ranging from a hairstyle, to a reality television show, to the theatre. Another tasteful definition of cultural studies is that of cultural-critic Ziauddin Sardar. In his book Introducing Cultural Studies, he argues that the field aims to examine its subject matter in relation to power, to understand culture in all its complex forms, to commit to an ethical evaluation of modern society and to a radical line of political action; and that culture is not only a subject of study, but a location of political criticism and action.
Indeed, the understanding and shaping of culture can be utilized to better societal ills. As such, forming a cultural studies department is not only significant, but more relevant today than ever before. Our day and age, in which social media has the capacity to turn around dictatorships, calls for supporting a discipline that at its core seeks to understand and utilize the potential of such phenomena. This very political aim, in fact, is what uniquely differentiates cultural studies from other departments where the majority of U.S. cultural scholars are currently housed. Many cultural studies scholars end up working as high level consultants for think tanks that implement such political strategy — we all have a stake in the future of the discipline in our universities.
As a future scholar of culture in the U.S. – I am gravely concerned. Concerned for myself, for my fellow colleagues, but most of all for the ignorance and unawareness that exists among American citizens vis-à-vis not only the field but the significance of cultural inquiry at large. Through consciousness-raising and support for the creation of unified cultural studies departments in our universities, the discussed lack of awareness and understanding will be challenged; as a growing number of individuals will inevitably become acquainted with the study. It’s already happened overseas, so why not here and now?

The closing of educational institutions is never a good idea, especially when it impacts those are just beginning their educations.
Amy Hsieh | Daily Trojan
In Chicago, one of the nation’s largest public school districts is closing 53 elementary schools and one high school, Yahoo! News reported on March 21. Furthermore, the schools the district is planning on closing that are located in primarily low-income areas, where the number of dropouts is rising at an alarming rate.
Because of population declines, public-school enrollment in Chicago has already seen a 20 percent fall in the last 10 years, especially in poor neighborhoods. Apparently, this was reason enough for the district to make this controversial decision to compensate for the $1-billion deficit that they face every year. Because the schools are not filled, they become a liability — a financial burden.
The decision was followed by angry protests and demonstrations by Chicago teachers contesting the mass closing of the elementary schools, according to the Huffington Post. Their sentiments were rightfully based, as many teachers would lose employment as a result of this decision.
Though the district will save money by closing these schools, the buildings will remain abandoned. The biggest problem with this decision, however, is that it will lead to a decline in the quality of education in minority neighborhoods — places that already face difficulties. These schools have the ability to hold 511,000 students, yet only 403,000 are enrolled. Of those schools, nearly 140 are more than half empty.
“Consolidating schools is the best way to make sure all of our city’s students get the resources they need to succeed in the classroom,” Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement.
Debt is an issue that plagues almost every city and state in this country. But there are ways to fix the problem without sacrificing something as imperative as education. With a lack of education, the cycle of financial ruin will continue with low-paying jobs and a job sector filled with unqualified applicants.
No one needs to be lectured on the importance of education, but to rip it away from children who have very few chances to begin with is cruel and unfair. These low-income schools deserve the opportunity to improve and not just have the future of their children taken away from them.
Yes, Chicago will be saving money. But at what cost?

The schools wouldn’t have to close if the teachers didn’t pressure Rahm to approve the highest pay in the nation corresponding to the most time off in the nation. Its the fault of the teachers and their union that all these schools are closing.

Fifteen states, including Texas and Florida, have put rules on the books banning political contributions while their state legislatures are in session. Now, Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, is looking to add California’s name to the list.
“I have put together a proposal that would ban all legislative fundraising and all fundraising for statewide officeholders at any time that the Legislature is in session,” said Schnur, a former chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission.
Currently, California bans contributions from lobbyists during the legislative session, but does not ban other fundraising. Though Schnur said this rule is well meaning, it does not prevent other contributors from writing a check during the session.
“Under the current system, the majority of legislators can attend fundraisers at breakfast, lunch and dinner every day they are in Sacramento,” he said.
Schnur’s proposal would limit all contributions during the legislative session, a regulation Schnur believes is necessary to “weaken the link between political giving and government activity.”
“Like it or not, fundraising is a legitimate political activity,” Schnur said. “But legislating is a legitimate political activity too. And they shouldn’t be done simultaneously.”
Schnur said the ban could produce several positive outcomes, such as increasing bipartisanship, reducing the appearance of impropriety and curbing the purchase of access during key votes.
“A check that’s written six months before a legislative vote is not going to offer nearly as strong a quid pro quo as that same check written 15 minutes before that same vote,” he said.
California legislative sessions typically run from early January to the end of August, with spring and summer breaks and two short sessions in September and December. But because legislative sessions can conceivably be any length, Schnur said the proposed ban would stay in effect for 72 hours after the legislative session ended.
“That way they can’t go out of session at 4 o’clock, hold a fundraising dinner and come back in at 7 [p.m.],” Schnur said. “Or what they do in Illinois — and this is especially appalling — Monday is fundraising day in Springfield and then Tuesday through Friday they legislate.”
The ban might also result in more contributions to politicians on the basis of ideology and philosophy, rather than to influence a particular bill, according to Schnur.
For Schnur, tackling campaign fundraising is the next logical step in reforming the state’s political system. He said adding a ban would strengthen two recent political reforms — the top-two primary and redistricting reform — by allowing for more bipartisanship to take place in Sacramento.
“They combine to create an environment where those legislators who are so inclined will have a safe space from which to work with members of the other party,” Schnur said.
A longtime Republican consultant, Schnur changed his party identification from Republican to “decline to state” in March 2011 to allow him to better campaign for political reform.
“This was not a matter of repudiating either political party, it was simply a matter of recognizing that in order to be an effective and credible reform advocate, it couldn’t be done from either major party,” said Schnur, who believes the ban would affect both parties equally.
Schnur plans to move forward with the ban by first reaching out to legislators, a group that Schnur recognizes might be reluctant to throw its weight behind such a proposal.
“As is the case with any political reform, by definition, anyone who has succeeded under the current rules is probably not going to be all that excited about seeing them changed,” he said.
Schnur also plans to reach out to those seeking statewide office and encouraging them to include the ban in their platforms. If all else fails, Schnur said a ballot initiative would be an option.
Though there has yet to be polling to measure public opinion on the proposal, Schnur said he believes voters will be on his side.
“While I’m not a soothsayer, I’d be willing to bet if you asked voters if they thought their elected representatives should have to forgo fundraising until their legislative responsibilities are completed each year, you’d probably get a pretty strong ‘yes’ vote,” he said.
Schnur is also currently in the process of working to organize a series of conferences on political reform, including the fundraising ban proposal, at colleges throughout the state.
