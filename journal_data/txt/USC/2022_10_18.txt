Popular dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge and Grindr are widely used by younger generations, including college students. A Pew Research study found that 48% of 18 to 29-year- olds have used a dating app. The Daily Trojan spoke to some USC students about their experiences and general campus attitudes toward certain dating apps.
Dating apps are popular with young people because they are convenient, allowing the user to pick and choose from a large number of people — or an endless number if you pay for a premium version — and message them from your phone. Dating apps also offer users a wide range of potential interactions, such as flings, one-night stands or even long-term relationships. Bumble has even started offering services for people looking just for friends or business networking.
Charlie Wasson, a junior majoring in business administration, has used Tinder and Bumble while at USC. He only used Tinder because it was the most popular app among USC students, but he preferred Bumble because of its unique feature: women must make the first move.
“I liked the fact that I didn’t have to message first on Bumble, especially after being on Tinder and getting no one, since messaging first, as a guy, is the expectation,” he said.
Despite having used both apps and messaging with people in his time at USC, Wasson has never met up with someone from a dating app in person.
“Sometimes you talk to people and the conversation gets kind of stale or boring,” he said. “Sometimes I just swipe on people. I wasn’t super interested in using it for actual dating, it was more like just a time killer kind of thing, so yeah, I never ended up on any of those dates.”
Yaebin Park, a junior majoring in law, history and culture, also said that her use of dating apps wasn’t in search of anything serious.
“I’ve never actually met up with anyone that I’ve met on these apps,” she said. “I use Tinder just to look at who’s around, but I don’t use it in a serious manner to look for someone I want to date.”
In addition to using Tinder and Bumble, Park has used Hinge, though her reasons for using all three were the same: popularity.
“Everybody I hear about uses Tinder,” Park said. “And I think, recently, Hinge and Bumble are very popular.”
Cole Engleman, a junior majoring in accounting, sees Tinder as being more for hookups and messing around, but apps like Bumble and Hinge as being geared more towards relationships.
“My friend’s sister actually met her husband on Bumble and they just got married this past year,” he said. “So that’s why I was a little more interested in that one, because it actually had a successful relationship, versus Tinder, where I’d never heard of something like that happening. I know one other friend used Bumble and I think he currently has a longlasting girlfriend as well.”
A more specific option for USC students is the Instagram page, @usc.missedconnections. Students can send in anonymous messages for attractive strangers that they saw or met on the University Park Campus but didn’t get a chance to see again, and the moderators of the page post these messages. Wasson and Park both thought of the page as a fun idea but only knew of it through being on Instagram. Wasson said that he wouldn’t consider sending in a missed connection, and Park said she felt that there were too many entries in each post to want to look at the posts consistently.
When asked about how they viewed the use of dating apps by all USC students, it seems like Wasson, Park and Engleman all think that, most of the time, students use dating apps like Tinder and Bumble to find hookups or to kill time, even if some apps, like Hinge, are more successful for long-term relationships.
“I think a lot of [people] use it to just hook up,” Wasson said. “I don’t think people are on there for long-term relationships. I have heard that people have been successful with apps like Hinge, and I have a few friends who’ve met their significant others on Hinge, but I don’t know any of my friends who’ve met actual people that they date through Tinder or Bumble.”

As The 1975 made the rounds to promote their newest album, lead singer Matt Healy told NME, “I’m not 50, but I’m not 19; I don’t want to be. I’m in my 30s. I want to be a grown-up.” Beneath the matter-of-fact Manchester attitude, this statement hinted at something massive for the band — maturation. A push, finally, beyond the slicked-back adolescence of their 2013 debut, an album whose stark depictions of sex, drugs and heartbreak had long overstayed its welcome.
Maybe, just maybe, “Being Funny in a Foreign Language” would be the step forward the group has so desperately needed, channeling their pop-rock leanings into songs that actually feel appropriate for a band with nearly a decade in the spotlight. 
Outwardly, the stars seemed to be aligning. The band announced that their new record would be a collaboration with producer Jack Antonoff, the major architect behind the introspective career shifts of Taylor Swift, Lorde and Lana Del Rey. 
The tracklist was a clear marker of a departure from their past. Gone were the days of the band’s 80-minute marathons; “Being Funny” features a trim, down-and-dirty 11 songs totaling 43 minutes. The entire rollout pointed towards a record that was a culmination of everything the band had learned so far, the sum of all the turbulent experiences that come with being The 1975. 
While the band certainly shoots for that ambitious billing, the final product feels too middling and inconsistent to fully make good on the record’s full potential. 
That’s not to say that “Being Funny in a Foreign Language” doesn’t come with its fair share of highlights. Take the eponymous opening track, “The 1975,” whose cycling pianos and swelling strings set a perfect stage for Healy’s dramatic tale of emotional growth throughout his time as one of rock music’s last star figures. He’s a cynical mess, mixing Adderall with Aperol, lamenting the current state of the world while acknowledging his lack of perspective on the matter. It’s the band’s classic, tongue-in-cheek songwriting formula, updated for a new chapter in their career.
Another highlight is “Oh Caroline,” which feels like a modernized ‘80s bop, complete with a chorus that is just too damn catchy not to become a sleeper hit. 
The album’s penultimate track, “About You,” sees the band employing the same cavernous, slow-mo production style you might hear on a classic Slowdive song, but with enough swirling, emotional guitars to land it on an A24 soundtrack. It’s a great change of pace for the band and a powerful “curtains close” moment for the album. 
Don’t get me wrong, there are some pretty amazing high points on this record. However, there are just as many moments that stand out for all the wrong reasons. 
From its sluggish pace to the awkwardly-placed transitions between the orchestral verses and acoustic choruses, “Part of the Band” — one of the album’s lead singles — feels like a loosely recorded demo track that was supposed to be properly finished down the road. The same criticisms apply to “Human Too,” one of the rare moments on the record where there isn’t even a strong, hummable tune at the core of the track. 
All of this criticism exists before even mentioning the lyrics. This album features, hands-down, some of Matt Healy’s tackiest and most grating songwriting on any The 1975 record to date. Whether he’s musing about “vaccinista tote bag chic baristas” on “Part of the Band” or the horrible attempt at quaint storytelling on “Wintering,” his lyrics consistently undermine otherwise enjoyable tracks. “I like socks and sandals, she’s more into scented candles” legitimately approaches “Drops of Jupiter” levels of stomach-churning corniness. The lyrics reek of a false sense of maturity, instead of the authentic songwriting progression that the band seemed to be moving towards. 
Despite reservations, this is not a bad record by any stretch. It fits snuggly into the band’s indie-pop canon while taking a few risks in the process. However, that’s all it does. Even with a new producer and a tightened tracklist, this still feels like just another The 1975 record, complete with all the familiar highs and lows. The band continues struggling to find its identity in a shifting musical landscape, and “Being Funny in a Foreign Language” doesn’t necessarily move the needle.

On a cloudy day in March of 2011, students that regularly commuted to and from class stopped and stared slack-jawed at the roof of Waite Phillips Hall. The source of the disruption? One USC student thought it was a good idea to cross “rooftop sex” off their bucket list.
People on campus caught the incident from all angles in graphic photos and videos, and the male USC student identified was quickly suspended from his fraternity. Still, the event left the campus abuzz with discussions about the repercussions of hookup culture, both public and private.
A decade later, the Daily Trojan spoke with students to explore how commonplace hookups remain at USC. Peer pressure, self-esteem issues and the stress of academic life all contribute, students say, to the non-committal sex taking place in dorm rooms, frat houses and who knows where else.
A recent article in the American Psychological Association highlights just how common hook-ups are. New data suggests that between 60% and 80% of North American college students have had some sort of hook-up experience.
Kaila Roberts, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, said the statistic sounded accurate and attributed the high percentage to the pressure students feel to hook up at schools like USC.
“The pressure of hook-up culture at these schools is very much real… if you just go up to a random person on the campus and ask them, ‘Hey, have you ever hooked up with someone before?,’ they probably will tell you yes. And it has become such a normal thing,” Roberts said. “It makes you feel like you should be doing that as well.”
The culture at USC and other campuses like it adds pressure on college students to participate in sexual activity despite doubts they may have. And, the media students can play a part in hook-up culture as well. Jade Bacon, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies, said she had seen TikToks of strangers with a microphone and a camera walking up to students in the USC Village and asking sexual questions for content.
“They’re always like, ‘What’s the freakiest thing you’ve ever done?’ It always has to be sexual related,” she said.
College marks a pivotal point in many students’ development into adults. Kevin Gramling, a sophomore majoring in theatre, explained how for many students college is their first time living away from home and in a completely personal space.
“We’re all similar-aged people living without authority figures,” Gramling said. “We have dorms, we have apartments, we have places that we partly own … So we have a personal space now for intimate things to happen.”
All of these factors make it easier to understand why college students may feel emboldened to hook up if they hadn’t previously. Roberts also said that there was external pressure from peers to not commit to a relationship,
“Oh, why are you in a relationship, you’re in college, you’re tying yourself down,” is the sentiment that Roberts said she’s heard on campus.
There are many different reasons why people might have a one-night stand, but some students at USC seem to think it’s because a serious relationship is not on the table and so casual sex is the next best thing — despite how hookup-obsessed people think college students are.
“It’s almost like it has a semblance of a serious relationship,” said Gramling, calling hookups a form of “intimate human physical connection” for those still developing into
adults. “We just recently became not children anymore.”
Jaydelle Herbert, a graduate student studying journalism, said hookups are a way for students to avoid confidence issues and boost self-esteem — some people feel the need to hook up because they need a confidence boost after a heartbreak. 
“They may use sex or just hook-up culture as a sense of building up their self-confidence in their body and everything,” she said.
Asked to describe hookups in a single word, students were all over the place:
“Outdated,” Roberts said.
“Overrated,” said Johanna Reyes a sophomore majoring in civil engineering.
“Toxic,” Herbert said.
Yet, the practice goes on and on, as much a part of the college experience as tailgating before the big game or cramming for an exam.
“How could you have a hookup with someone, or something meaningless before you even have your own first relationship? Isn’t that crazy? How could you try to imitate love before you even felt it?” Roberts said.

Content warning: This article discusses sexual assault.
I apologize for the length of time since my last piece. I was going through it. 
The first edition of “Sex, Drugs & Spotify” detailed my journey in the Daily Trojan newsroom, but it was silly of me to think of it as sound. 
I have since left my position as managing editor and had the worst comedown of my life following the publishing of my first piece. I was upset with myself for not sustaining it as I had planned, but I’m glad to know writing is still a much stronger drug than the other stuff. 
You can plan and draft all you want. It’s probably not going to turn out that way.
School used to be my thing (it kind of had to be) but then life happened and I learned far more while outside of the classroom. 
And yet, every once in a while, a professor says just the right thing and everything starts to make a little sense again. My “Music as Communication” class, in particular, has equipped me with words and ideals important enough to knock me out of a haze. We talk about noise and sound and music. The overlaps, the discrepancies. The power of it all. It’s been the classroom where I’ve learned the most. 
My professor once said some songs take women places men cannot follow. Beyond the limiting constraints of the binary and a general adherence toward heterosexuality, I think he’s right. 
There are some songs that are not for others and they never have to be. 
I saw the Yeah Yeah Yeahs in concert a couple weeks ago, and listening to Karen O sing “Y Control” did something to me that I’m not even going to attempt to describe. There are moments that come to feel definitive of who you are and at the very best times, it’s that one song you finally got to hear live. “Petrified” by Omar Apollo also did it for me. 
Then there are the worst of times. 
It has been almost two years since I was sexually assaulted in my hometown by a USC student. I didn’t even realize this but my body sure as hell knows.
I often don’t know where to begin when it comes to talking about this but it’s probably because it doesn’t feel like it ever ended. I do know that this week is “Sex Week” at USC, so I’ll try. 
I wanted to save this piece for later, maybe when we knew each other a little bit better, but I do not have the luxury of saving parts of myself until the third date. 
My heart, guts and insides purge out of me with such velocity at times that there is no controlling it and everyone in arm’s reach is caught in the crossfire. 
I do not have the graces to remain nonchalant or appear aloof during my casual endeavors, of which I probably have too many. 
Too many have seen the suffocating panic attacks after we’ve laid in bed together that make me go mute, and too many know I avoid the Sexual Assault Prevention training each semester for as long as I can (this semester, USC charged me $80 for not finishing by the deadline). 
I guess it feels a bit redundant to remain mysterious and “leave them wanting more” when I feel my baggage is conversely, at times, what brought us here in the first place. It’s maybe even why you’re reading this far-too-deep invasion into my life.
Just as we have words such as beginning and end despite any evidence of either, time has passed since that one October night despite my feet remaining glued to the grass field he dragged me to. 
I’ve tried to do what I can in terms of healing, but I’m not sure there is truly such a thing. Contrary to what many (and I) want to believe — that there is a time when I will have moved on — there is not.  
My assault is not who I am. But, just as the best of songs, it is woven intricately throughout my skin in the most delicate manner that any gust of wind can tear me at the seams. 
It is not in any therapy session or virtual sexual assault course that I have made sense of it all, but in that room in Annenberg where I can ramble on about chord progressions and the music I’ve been consuming with such a natural fire that I don’t have to think twice about leaving it all on the table that I feel better. 
During one class period, our professor showed us the dance scene in Steve McQueen’s “Lovers Rock” film where Janet Kay’s “Silly Games” fills the room. When the DJ pauses the song, the partygoers continue to sing, a capella style, and it’s while watching this that I felt some things click.
Yes, I might not ever feel like I did before. There are things I will continue to work on. I’m always going to be going through it. 
But thankfully, I am sustained by the music in my life that means so much more. When the right song cuts or ends or ceases, it lives on in us. 
It holds me steady, it breathes for me when I forget how to, it brings tears to my eyes when I try to hold them back. It carries me. 
There are few things that feel like my own. My body has not always been one. But the way I listen to music — at least that will always be mine.

In the United States, over 600,000 undergraduate and graduate students are eligible for federal work-study benefits, a program that was developed in 1964 with the goal of helping low-income college students earn money to contribute toward their tuition and ease the burden of school-related expenses. However, Sandy Baum writes in an Urban Institute article that recent numbers have shown that the program is becoming less successful in targeting low-income students and thus is failing to provide aid for those who need it most. 
A research study at Columbia University found that in the last decade, low-income students at private schools have a 50% chance of receiving federal work-study, while students at public schools or community colleges have only a 5% chance of receiving work-study. To put this into perspective, high-income students at private schools have a better chance of receiving work-study funds than low-income students attending public universities. This is a prime example of how the Federal Work-Study program is failing to serve low-income students and how oftentimes, work-study proves to be far less accessible than promised. 
A major problem with the current federal work-study program is the fact that jobs are not guaranteed. Instead, universities require students to personally seek out and apply for the positions with little to no guidance. Although these students are eligible for the funds, they cannot receive them until they are employed. Even when students do acquire work-study jobs, they are often overwhelmed due to being overworked and underpaid, as work-study jobs are only required to pay students minimum wage.
On the other hand, there is a large majority of students who will never get their work-study funds. This is due to the lack of available jobs, their busy school schedules and the competitiveness of obtaining a desirable work-study job, leaving them with the eligibility for work-study funds and yet no means of earning them. While universities and the government advertise the promise of work-study to those who need it, it is actually not guaranteed at all; despite there being over 600,000 undergraduate and graduate college students eligible for work-study in the U.S., only about half of them actually become employed through their school and earn their allotted funds. 
In addition to the lack of certainty surrounding work-study, there is a lack of prioritization for low-income students. While the goal of the program was originally to aid students who demonstrated the most financial need, students from middle and relatively high-income families have become eligible for work-study benefits over the last few years. In the 2016-2017 school year, one-fifth of federal work-study funds went to students from families who earned at least $80,000 — therefore taking away from the funds allocated to low-income students. The government and universities alike need to focus on distributing work-study funds to those who need them most. Instead of giving benefits to those with stable family incomes, they should be giving more benefits to struggling students. 
With that being said, it is clear that work-study is not nearly as straightforward as it is advertised by the Federal Work-Study program and participating universities. There are many unpredictable factors that accompany the process of acquiring a work-study job: the main factor being that work-study is not guaranteed and must be sought out by the student, a process that does not come without its obstacles. 
As a low-income, first-generation college student attending a prestigious private university like USC, I was thrilled when I was offered work-study. I felt relieved that there was a way for me to contribute to the cost of my tuition while also being a full-time student. With absolutely no idea what I was doing and little guidance from the University, I applied to many positions and came back empty-handed. I was very disappointed, but I was already extremely overwhelmed with the pressure of getting good grades, joining extracurriculars, as well as maintaining a healthy social life. 
I found the obstacles of applying for and securing a work-study job unnecessarily complicated and because of this, I did not secure a work-study job until this year, as a sophomore — which still did not come without its challenges. Talking amongst my peers, I have found that my situation is actually relatively common with other students eligible for work-study, and while the perks of work-study look terrific on paper, the process has proven to be much easier said than done. 
Universities such as USC, where the cost of tuition is constantly rising, must do more to make these jobs readily accessible to their most disenfranchised students. Students with the most financial insecurity should be prioritized when it comes to student employment and a student awarded work-study benefits should be guaranteed a job — or at least adequate guidance from their university — to seek out and apply for jobs. The Federal Work-Study program was formed to help low-income students, so let’s make sure it actually happens.

Reduce, reuse, recycle: a phrase we all learned in elementary school and saw repeatedly on flashy posters plastered on walls and trash cans wherever we went. But beyond this catchphrase, what do we really learn about the environment while in school? 
I would say that the majority of what I know about climate change and the importance of sustainability comes from reading the news and seeing people post about it online on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. In addition, I attended left-leaning schools, so my teachers and peers weren’t hesitant to bring up climate change issues in classes and have discussions about them. However, even after all of these experiences, I still feel as though I do not know enough about the climate crisis and what I should be doing to reduce the impacts of global warming. 
According to climate.gov, Earth’s temperature has been rising at over double the rate that it was prior to 1981, contributing to temperatures reaching new extremes every year, reduced snow and sea ice levels (especially in the Arctic), increased heavy rainfall and changing habitat ranges. Every year, the problem is getting worse because of our inaction, demonstrating the need for a more rigid and comprehensive environmental education requirement, whether it be implemented anywhere from elementary school to universities. 
We are at our most impressionable when we are first learning about the world in elementary and middle school. Therefore, a more comprehensive environmental education curriculum can be implemented to educate youth about sustainable practices (beyond just the three Rs) and climate change issues. 
Starting the conversation early on increases the chances of the future generation advocating for environmental change as they grow older and working towards new initiatives to make that change themselves. 
Environmental education includes raising awareness and understanding of environmental challenges, increasing motivation to improve environmental quality, building skills to identify and resolve environmental challenges and participation in activities that resolve these challenges. By establishing a proper environmental education requirement sometime in our educational journey, we can ensure that students worldwide are equipped with the proper and necessary information and tools to implement changes into their own lives, and hopefully even take actions in their larger communities towards the cause. 
Although this plan is ideal, many conservative people in the United States argue that the left is simply over-exaggerating or making up the facts about climate change — not believing that it is a reality and arguing that people should not prioritize sustainability over profitability. Many conservatives even believe that the science behind global warming is speculative and refuse to acknowledge the many statistics and scientific findings that support the existence and negative impacts of global warming on our future. 
To rely on political discourse to raise enough awareness about these issues and to encourage sustainable habits is practically a lost cause, especially in areas where the general consensus is that global warming is nothing more than a political buzzword. Educating students about the environment should not end within the K-12 public education systems. It is up to higher academia to properly educate young individuals about the climate crisis, reduce the large-scale sentiment that climate issues are simply political issues and increase awareness about the incredibly rapid impacts that climate change will have on our environment, health and well-being. 
Several colleges, including the University of Minnesota and the University of Washington, have implemented an environmental studies requirement into their general education curriculums. Other colleges must begin to follow in their footsteps. Although college is not the most ideal time for people to begin learning about the environment and what they can do for it, it’s never too late to learn. 
Requiring students to learn something is never the most effective method to teach about something as vital as global warming and sustainability, since many won’t necessarily feel incentivized enough to care about the course or module if it is mandatory. But this can be argued with all the general education courses we have. Regardless, it’s critical to educate and inform students and at the very least, it would be a step in the right direction. 
Whether it’s a natural world requirement like the University of Washington has in their general education curriculum, or simply another module or two required about sustainable habits to take to register for classes, USC and other post-secondary institutions should begin to encourage students to learn about these pressing issues, do their part both in their own lives and encourage larger-scale efforts to fight climate change in communities around them.

Well, there you have it. USC will not go undefeated in Head Coach Lincoln Riley’s debut season with the Trojans. 
It was never a doubt before the season that the matchup against Utah would be the litmus test of USC’s progress. The Utes are a Pac-12 staple, a model of consistency with a winning season every year since 2013. That build-up culminated in a dominant Pac-12 conference win last season. 
So when the schedule makers created this matchup for the Trojans — especially on the road where Utah is an entirely different team — everyone around the program knew this one was it. Yours truly even wrote he wasn’t sold until USC played the Utes. 
Dare I even say, in a loss, I am sold on the Trojans.
Look, no one in their right mind expected USC to be this good this fast. Remember, a year ago around this time the Trojans were 3-3 and would win one more game the rest of the season. Yikes. 
The hiring of Riley fast-tracked the program’s road back to glory. The transfer portal, the culture shift, you’ve heard all about it. But, the play on the field and the aura around the team are drastically different. 
I covered last year’s football team — it was simply sad at times. Lots of empty games and empty seats with the lowest of the lowest coming in that Bruin beatdown. 
Do you remember the embarrassing blowouts? UCLA quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson turning the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum into his personal playground? Fans booing the team off the field?
Those things happened just under a year ago. 
Not only are all the off-field aspects of a program different, but the stench left behind by Clay Helton’s tenure — spine-busting penalties, terrible tackling — have, for the most part, been decimated in just 10 months. Most of that can be attributed to a vastly different roster, but changing those habits takes time and, most importantly, commitment from the players. 
Can you imagine how different things will look in a year?  
But rebuilds aren’t supposed to be this quick. Remember, Pete Carroll’s first season at USC ended with a 6-6 record. Granted he didn’t have the pleasure of the transfer portal, however, the point is: these things take time.
That’s why after the Trojans’ close loss against Utah, there’s no need to be discouraged or distraught. They were in that game. A few penalties go the other way, and this space would be dedicated to proclaiming the program’s return to dominance. It wasn’t the case though, and there’s nothing wrong with that. 
Don’t look at UCLA handling the Utes at home as evidence USC is behind its crosstown rivals — Utah is 5-5 on the road in the last two seasons, compared to 10-0 at home. I’ll get to the Bruins in a future column. 
Any hope of the College Football Playoff is now seemingly shut. A crucial win on the road against a ranked conference opponent would have been a huge resume boost.  
The Trojans had to go undefeated to warrant any chance of sneaking into the top four. The strength of their schedule plays a part, but an 11-1 finish before the conference championship game could help USC’s chances. You just got to get there first. 
The fact that we’re even having these discussions on social media and in this publication is incredible. Riley has turned this program around from the laughingstock of the country to a powerhouse waiting to happen. 
Could you have thought this would be the case a year ago?
No one could have predicted USC’s rapid turnaround. And for that, the Trojans’ loss doesn’t sting as much as it should. They weren’t supposed to be this way ahead of schedule.
