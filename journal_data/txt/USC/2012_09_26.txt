This probably won’t come as a surprise: The USC men’s water polo team is favored to win the NCAA championship this fall.
After becoming the first school to win the NCAA championship four years in a row, the Trojans were expected to be great again this year — but what they’ve done this season so far is remarkable, and the odds are in their favor to raise the trophy once again this December.

The No. 1 Trojans aren’t even halfway finished with their season, but they’ve already claimed marquee wins over the rest of the expected title contenders.
On Sept. 16, they claimed one-goal victories over then-No. 4 Stanford and No. 2 UCLA in a tournament held at the Cardinal’s home pool.
Then, in their nationally televised home conference opener against No. 4 California on Sunday, the Trojans came back in the final period to claim a 7-6 victory. And that was with All-American junior driver Nikola Vavic saying he had a bad game.
Vavic’s father, longtime USC coach Jovan Vavic, has overseen an unprecedented run by the water polo team during his 18 years at the helm.
USC hasn’t missed the four-team NCAA tournament since 2004. The squad has played in the NCAA championship match eight of the past nine years, claiming six titles.
And those championship wins have come at a variety of venues on the road — Stanford, Bucknell, Stanford again, Princeton and then Berkeley the past two years.
But this year, for the first time ever, the Trojans will have the advantage of hosting the NCAA tournament at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium on campus. USC will also play at home for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
That’s a welcome sign for a team that has won 18 matches in a row at home, dating back to a 12-9 loss against California in October 2010. The Trojans ended up avenging that loss later in the season with a 12-10 win over California in their own pool to clinch the NCAA title.
Many might have expected USC to regress this year after graduating driver Peter Kurzeka, last season’s top scorer, and goalie Joel Dennerley, who last season became the first male goalkeeper to win the Peter J. Cutino Award, the most prestigious individual honor in water polo.
But the Trojans have simply replaced Dennerley with a pair of similarly impressive goalkeepers in junior transfer James Clark and redshirt sophomore Ely Bonilla.
Clark, who backed up Dennerley on the Australian national squad in this summer’s Olympics, averaged 10 saves and 4.3 goals allowed in three games. Bonilla has averaged 8.4 saves and 4.4 goals allowed per game in six appearances. Those numbers compare favorably to Dennerley, who averaged 9.2 saves and 5.4 goals allowed per game in his historic senior season.
On offense, USC has reloaded behind the younger Vavic, sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias and a whole lot of depth.
Vavic, who was second on the team last year with 41 goals, has already tallied 27 goals this season. He moved into 20th place on USC’s all-time scoring list after making the game-winning goal against Cal on Sunday.
Genidounias, the reigning MPSF Player of the Week, is the Trojans’ only other double-digit scorer with 14 goals.
The dangerous duo are just two of the 20 players that have found the back of the net for USC this season. 13 of those players have scored at least six goals.
There’s no doubt that the Trojans still have plenty of tough opponents left on the schedule — but the powerful four-team hierarchy of USC, UCLA, Stanford and Cal is rarely threatened by other teams.
One of those four teams has won every NCAA championship since 1997, when Pepperdine beat USC 8-7 in double overtime. USC hasn’t lost to an opponent outside of that four-team group since 2005, in a 5-4 road defeat also against Pepperdine.
It bodes well for the Trojans that they’ve already defeated their three main rivals this season. If USC can keep pulling off victories against those three teams when they inevitably clash in the conference and NCAA tournaments, fans could see the first ever five-peat right here on campus in December.
Does anyone want to bet against them?

The Los Angeles Clippers will kick off the 2012-13 NBA season with a scrimmage open to the public at the Galen Center on Oct. 3, the team announced Wednesday.
Coach Vinny Del Negro will lead his team through a training camp practice that will conclude with an intra-squad scrimmage scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m.
The Galen Center serves as the home venue for USC’s basketball and volleyball teams.
The scrimmage will be the second opportunity for fans to see professional basketball at the Galen Center in less than a week, as the Los Angeles Sparks host the San Antonio Silver Stars in the WNBA Western Conference Semi-finals on Thursday.
The Clippers finished 40-26 last year and beat the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the NBA playoffs. Both forward Blake Griffin and guard Chris Paul were elected starters in the 2012 NBA All-Star game.
It will be the first opportunity for fans to see the new offseason additions, including guard Jamal Crawford, who averaged 13.9 points per game for the Portland Trail Blazers last year, and veteran forward Grant Hill. The Clippers also acquired a trio of former Los Angeles Lakers in Matt Barnes, Lamar Odom and Ronny Turiaf.
Clippers assistant coach Robert Pack played for two seasons at USC. Former USC forward Nick Young, who played for the Clippers last season, is now with the Philadelphia 76ers. Two Clippers, Barnes and Ryan Hollins, went to UCLA.
The Galen Center’s doors open at 5:15 p.m. and close at 7:00 p.m. Fans are encouraged by officials to arrive early to avoid lines, as last year’s scrimmage drew more than 8,000 fans. Fans can enter through either the north or south entrances off Figueroa Street, and parking in USC lots will cost $20.
The Clippers play their first exhibition game on Oct. 6 against the Denver Nuggets in Las Vegas, and begin the regular season on Oct. 31 against the Memphis Grizzlies.

When Brian Scalabrine, one of the most recognizable players in the NBA, retired in early September, fans across the country took notice. The 6-foot-9 forward logged just 4.4 minutes per game for the Chicago Bulls during the 2012 season, but that didn’t stop the Windy City faithful from anointing him the “White Mamba,” a nickname befitting the redheaded journeyman.
Scalabrine’s career spanned 11 seasons — far from a joking matter for a role player originally selected in the second round. He appeared in four NBA Finals, winning a championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008.
But perhaps unfairly, Scalabrine had to shake the perception that he was more of a sideshow as his career winded down, culminating in a now-infamous clip of a foreign reporter asking Scalabrine how it felt to “not [be] able to play even one little second” in Boston’s championship appearance against the Los Angeles Lakers. Scalabrine took the question about as well as one could.
“I’m all about winning,” he said. “When you’re asked the question, ‘Do you want to sit on the bench and win or play 10 minutes and lose?’ I will always say I’ll sit on the bench and win. Being a part of that was special.”
Long before a simple search of his name spawned millions of hits across the Internet, Scalabrine was a member of the USC men’s basketball team, playing an instrumental part on a squad that advanced further in the NCAA tournament than any other in school history. And with his professional career in the books, the college chapter of Scalabrine’s story serves as an important reminder of what he was able to achieve for more than a decade.
 
Where It Began
Brian Scalabrine’s rise to the NBA began at Highline Community College in 1997. He entered the school as a little-known recruit from Enumclaw, Wash., and remained under the radar despite winning a junior college state championship in his first season.
“No one was really recruiting him, that was the number one issue,” former USC coach Henry Bibby said. “But he was a big kid that had skills I loved.”
Playing in the relative obscurity of the Pacific Northwest, Scalabrine wasn’t sure if playing at a Division I program was in the cards, but a trip to California opened his eyes.
“After I played one year at junior college and I went down to a shootout in L.A. in the summertime, I realized I probably could play at the Division I level if I just continued the process of what I was doing,” he said. “And that was getting in the gym, working hard a couple of times a day. I realized a lot of people just don’t put that type of work in when they’re trying to make it, and I felt like I did.”
But the transition to USC wasn’t easy.
Scalabrine took a leap of faith from the small-town surroundings of Enumclaw, population 10,000, to the second-most populated city in the United States. In Enumclaw, farmlands dot the countryside, which served as a comforting sight as he honed his basketball skills. In Los Angeles, it was impossible to block out the world around him like he had in the past — Scalabrine had to adjust to a new way of life before he could truly focus on basketball.
“The hardest year was my first year,” Scalabrine said. “My slow-paced lifestyle switched over to something so big. You realize that L.A. is such a big city and everything is a big deal.”
Still, Scalabrine put together a more than solid stat line as a sophomore during the 1998-99 season, averaging 14.6 points and 6.4 rebounds while winning Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year. The Trojans finished 15-13, a six-game improvement from the year before.
 
Jumping Ahead
Draft night in 2001 wasn’t the glitz and glamour occasion many see at Madison Square Garden each June. Scalabrine knew he’d be selected somewhere, but carried the same mentality that nothing was guaranteed. And he quickly discovered that type of mentality was necessary to survive the dog-eat-dog competitiveness of the NBA.
Scalabrine was selected in the second round (35th pick overall) by the New Jersey Nets, a team that would soon swap point guard Stephon Marbury for fellow point guard Jason Kidd.
“I had a non-guaranteed contract so I had to go earn my way,” Scalabrine said. “I made it, but I had a lot of work to do if I wanted to make this my life.”
He was thrown into an unusual situation, playing for a team full of surprisingly mature 20-somethings who quickly combined their talents to make a run through the Eastern Conference playoffs.
Scalabrine was limited by injuries as a rookie, appearing in 28 games toward the end of the season. But he was still a member of a Nets team that advanced to the NBA Finals before bowing out to the Lakers. The next season, Scalabrine saw an expanded role, averaging 12.3 minutes per game off the bench as the Nets returned to the Finals, losing to the San Antonio Spurs in six games.
“Culture is very important,” Scalabrine said. “I can pinpoint teams that lose all the time that have bad culture. Kenyon Martin and Jason Kidd were all about winning. For me to go the Finals two years in a row, it helped me learn a lot about the culture of winning and the culture of the NBA.”
During the 2004-05 season, Scalabrine averaged a career high 21.6 minutes per game, putting up 6.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists.
That was enough to attract the attention of the Boston Celtics, who signed him to a five-year, $15 million dollar deal the following offseason. A championship and a meteoric rise in popularity would soon follow.
 
The White Mamba
Scalabrine quickly became a fan favorite for the Celtics, his public profile growing even larger after a joyous post-championship press conference about proving the media wrong for choosing the Lakers to win their Finals matchup. Even the disparaging question from the foreign reporter failed to dampen the moment.
Two years later, Scalabrine joined the Chicago Bulls, where he played even more sparingly but took on a leadership role. He turned into a strange phenomenon, becoming one of the most identifiable and endearing players in the league while hardly leaving the bench. Chicago fans lobbied for his appearances at the end of blowouts.
“There are a significant amount of people out there that like the idea of me making it to the NBA and think that I’m a good player,” Scalabrine said. “There’s also a significant amount of people that think that what I do is a joke and they’re being condescending towards me. In no way would I want to put down any NBA fans, but I will say this: If you think what I have and what I got is because I won a contest or something, it’s not like that.”
Scalabrine isn’t being cross when he says this, but he does want to be treated fairly.
“I do love the fans that truly understand the game,” Scalabrine said. “But I also have a low level of respect for fans that don’t understand the game and think that what I have was given to me.”
It’s hard to argue with his logic — Scalabrine was cut twice from his high school basketball team before even catching on at the junior college level. His work ethic since his early teenage years is indisputable. He made it through 11 NBA seasons, six more than the average player logging his amount of minutes per game. And he certainly isn’t the first athlete to contribute veteran guidance to a championship team while not registering many minutes.
Back to School
If you believe Bibby and the rest of the 2000-01 Trojans, the team that went further in the NCAA tournament than any other squad in USC history was also far less talented than their record shows.
“I didn’t have a lot of talent, but I had guys playing together,” Bibby said. “It was a team of guys who knew how to play, win and sacrifice.”
By 2001, Scalabrine had established himself as one of the best players in the Pac-10. He  averaged nearly 18 points and six rebounds per game as a junior. Those numbers took a slight dip on a deeper team, but that was the least of Scalabrine’s concerns: He was well on his way to a pro career.
“[The starters] all played 37, 38 minutes a game,” forward David Blu said. “We all took a different leadership role. It was a competitive nature that we all had. We pushed each other every day.”
The Trojans finished the regular season 24-10, entering the tournament as the sixth seed. They knocked out 11th-seeded Oklahoma State 69-54 in the first round before rolling off upset victories over third-seeded Boston College and second-seeded Kentucky. USC’s run was eventually ended by Duke, which went on to win the NCAA championship. Even still, it was a memorable experience for all those involved.
“I’ve been in basketball close to 40 years, and the most satisfying event I’ve ever been a part of was that Elite 8 run,” Bibby said.
 
The Next Step
“Brian is one of the hardest working players I’ve ever known,” former teammate David Blu said.
It’s not a lack of passion for the game that made Scalabrine decide to hang up his kicks in early September. He could’ve gone through training camps and tried to catch on with an NBA squad, or travel overseas to play a larger role internationally. But at 34 and with a young family, Scalabrine insists he has nothing left to prove.
He told Yahoo Sports’ Adrian Wojnarowski that he’ll be working in a limited role for the Boston Celtics broadcasting booth this season, although that partnership has yet to be made official.
“If I had no other opportunities in life, I would’ve just tried to play and see what happens,” Scalabrine said. “But I do have these other opportunities to do something and I don’t want to pass [them] up.”
Another such opportunity could be a coaching career, possibly at USC, should the prospect present itself.
“I would never want to say, ‘I want to take someone’s job,’” he said. “If something intriguing like my old school wants me to coach, help out or be an assistant, I’d really think about that. I’d think about that because my time there was special, and the relationships I built there were special.”
Scalabrine means what he says about his time at USC — Bibby and his staff were the first people to take a chance on the big man who had been passed up so many times before, and that isn’t lost on him today.
“USC gave me the opportunity to go out there and showcase my talents,” Scalabrine said. “USC gave me the opportunity to expand my horizons and become more culturally diverse. USC gave me the opportunity to play in the NBA for 11 years. I feel like I owe my alma mater as opposed to they owe me.”

Mikhail Vinaykin, a Ph.D. candidate in the chemistry department who was known for his “contagious curiosity,” died in a motorcycle accident on Exposition Boulevard on Tuesday morning. He was 24.
Vinaykin grew up in Russia and attended St. Petersburg State University, where he received his undergraduate degree in physics. He moved to the United States to begin his graduate program in chemistry at USC in 2009.

Professors endearingly referred to Vinaykin as “Misha” and described him as an enthusiastic student who had a knack for the sciences.
“I’ve been around for a long time so there’s not many things that surprise me,” said Professor Alex Benderskii, Vinaykin’s research adviser. “But Misha surprised me almost on a daily basis, and that’s really special.”
Vinaykin was in his fourth year of the program. His research focused on ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy with a focus on hydrogen bonding and water. Vinaykin’s peers said they remembered his dedication and a commitment that had very few limits.
“Misha was highly motivated and very interested in science and knowledge,” said Fadel Shalhout, a graduate student who worked with Vinaykin. “If he experienced problems in research he spent all night in the lab figuring it out.”
Professor Jahan Dawlaty, a first assistant professor of chemistry, said he was immediately impressed with Vinaykin when he came to USC. Vinaykin inquired the most and seemed the most engaged in discussions, he said.
“Misha asked questions until he had the right answer, which was the sign of a good scientist,” Dawlaty said.
Vinaykin was Dawlaty’s teaching assistant for his upper-level chemistry class this semester. He connected with the juniors and seniors he taught, Dawlaty said. The day after Vinaykin’s death, Dawlaty began his class with a minute of silence.
“He certainly did have a fan club of students because some [students] only attended his discussion session,” Dawlaty said. “Many students were quite sad and shocked.”
Students outside the chemistry department also admired his curiosity.
“He was always asking questions and he was eager to learn more about the French language,” said Annie Capaldi, an undeclared freshman in his French class. “I think we all gained a little bit by being in the class with him and witnessing his passion for learning.”
Vinaykin, in addition to sharing his passions for the sciences, also had an infectious personality. Graduate students who studied with him said he had a good sense of humor and a love for travel.
“In his 24 years of living,” Shalhout said, “he probably experienced as much as a 100-year-old man. He lived life to the fullest.”
Vinaykin’s death has left a vacancy in the department that will not be easily filled, Benderskii said.
“He absolutely had a big role in the chemistry department,” Benderskii said. “Everyone knew him, and he had a lot of friends and a lot of faculty knew him and were enthusiastic about his prospects.”
Columbia University and other top institutions were courting him for his two- to three-year post-doctoral work, according to Benderskii.
Vinaykin’s parents are flying into Los Angeles on Thursday from Russia. Plans for a memorial service are pending.

With each coming year, Alternative Break programs are becoming the hot option for students looking to make the most out of their winter or spring vacations. This year, an increase in student interest caused student coordinators to plan 13 trips, including a new destination in India.
The program has evolved from offering eight trips in 2009 as interest has increased. Last year, the volunteer center received a total of 269 applications for approximately 225 available spots.
The center expects an even greater level of interest this year.
“We’ve grown in the number of trips and in the amount of student interest every year,” said Kate Johnson, the graduate assistant for the Alternative Break programs. “Student coordinators have really become the advocates for the focus of their trip and inspire their participants.”
The specific focuses of the trips range from hunger and homelessness to juvenile reform. Each program is planned by student coordinators for their peers.
“It’s a great opportunity because they learn,” said Joenique Rose, program manager for Alternative Breaks and Community Partners. “They’ve grown, and they show leadership qualities and skills they’ve built on their trip and then they’re able to bring it back again for their fellow peers here at USC.”
The most recent addition, a two-week winter break trip to India, is the brainchild of Alternative Break student coordinator Molly Barnes, a senior majoring in fine arts who has been volunteering in India since she was 17.
“I was visiting an art exhibit at the Skirball Museum [in Los Angeles] showcasing violence and domestic abuse, health issues and sex trafficking in different countries,” Barnes said. “I was looking at the content of the exhibit at USC and wondered, ‘Why not have a trip to India?’”
Students participating in Barnes’ program will volunteer in the 3,000-population community of Banjara Basti where they will introduce a new financial literacy program to help locals living in poverty.
As part of the trip, students will not only give their services to the Banjara Basti community, but will also immerse themselves in Hindi culture during their travels. Participants will live with a family on a village farm, as well as take cooking classes, yoga and dressing workshops and visit iconic destinations, including the Taj Mahal.
“The trip’s focus is sustainable education because we’re trying to blend a new curriculum for our NGO partners to hopefully create a system to bring in more volunteers, and to keep that relationship going within the slums after we leave,” Barnes said. “I’m really excited because it’s so different and this organization was not thought of until we hosted it so it’s really unique to USC. This is really a self-starter trip.”
Students can fundraise to lower the cost of the all-inclusive package, which includes food, lodging, airfare and excursions. Though every trip has a cost, many students feel the experience is priceless because of the memories and friendships they get out of these trips.
“In Catalina Island, we worked with the USC Wrigley center for environmental sciences and got to go scuba diving and do activities I wouldn’t have done over spring break on my own,” said Kristen Villarreal, a senior majoring in public relations. “It was pretty rewarding to feel like I helped a community during my time off instead of most options for spring break.”
With increasing opportunities to provide more students the chance to travel, students are becoming increasingly attracted to a fun way of giving their service rather than relaxing their two-week vacation away.
“I want to go to Guatemala to work with an elementary school because I really like working with kids and I want to go somewhere I’ve never been before,” said Sarah Schodrof, a junior majoring in acting. “It would be a mini abroad experience for me, since I’m not going abroad, while giving me opportunities for service.”
Johnson hopes that students will take advantage of the program at least once during their time at USC.
“By being a part of this, students are gaining a cultural awareness they may have never had before,” Johnson said. “Our hope and our goal is for students to have this firsthand experience of being an advocate and an agent for change and come back and spread it to others in their community.”

Though much of the focus on the Nov. 6 election has centered on the presidential race, several significant measures that will affect California policy will also be considered.
One such proposal is Proposition 34, which seeks to abolish the state’s death penalty for convicted murderers, according to the California Official Voter Information Guide. This would apply not only to future trials but also retroactively to existing cases; prisoners who have already been condemned to Death Row would now receive life in prison without the possibility of parole.
A poll released Sept. 25 by the University of California, Berkeley and the Field Group showed that 45 percent of total likely voters are opposed to Prop. 34, while 42 percent of voters are in favor. Thirteen percent said they are undecided. Opinions on the issue are largely dependent on party lines: 50 percent of Democrats responded that they plan to vote for the proposition but only 23 percent of Republicans said the same.
USC students have mixed opinions on Prop. 34 and on the death penalty itself. USC College Republicans President Maddy Lansky, a senior majoring in political science, said she opposes the measure.
“When you consciously and intentionally take someone’s life, you lose the ability to keep yours,” Lansky said.
USC College Democrats President Aaron Taxy, a junior majoring in international relations, has a different opinion on the issue.
“Virtually no other countries have a death penalty besides the United States,” Taxy said. “The United States has the worst murder rate of any developed country, so there’s no evidence that the death penalty is [a] deterrence.”
Under California’s current system, criminals who are convicted of first-degree murder plus special circumstances — if the murder was particularly heinous, occurred for financial gain or occurred along with other criminal activities — are eligible to receive the death penalty. Once a criminal is sentenced to death, his or her case is automatically appealed to the California Supreme Court. After that, the condemned prisoner has the right to appeal his or her case many more times and before many more courts, judges and juries before the sentence is actually carried out.
One argument for the ballot measure is that doing away with capital punishment will be more cost-effective, according to Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior fellow at the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
According to the proposition, former Death Row prisoners would be required to work and pay their earnings to their victims’ families. The state would also save money by reducing the costs of the special individual-cell housing and extra security allotted to Death Row inmates, as well as on lawyers’ fees for criminals who cannot afford their own lawyers but seek to appeal their cases.
“In California, we spend seven times as much on death row inmates than we do on life sentence inmates because the appeals process is incredibly expensive,” Taxy said. “California really can’t afford its current criminal policy. Unless we reform it, Proposition 34 really is the best option.”
Other proponents took issue with the ethics of capital punishment.
Merahm Hamdan, a senior majoring in math and theater, said she objects to the death penalty on grounds that it is immoral.
“I’d rather see someone imprisoned for life,” Hamdan said. “I have a hard time with the idea of taking another person’s life. It rubs me the wrong way and I think it rubs everyone the wrong way.  I wouldn’t say murderers and rapists don’t deserve the death penalty, but taking someone’s life is a really hard thing to do.”
According to Jeffe, proponents also argue that eliminating the death penalty will ensure that innocent individuals are not executed in California.
“One of the most compelling arguments is there is always a question that an innocent person will be sentenced to death and will have the death penalty implemented,” Jeffe said.
 
Prop. 34 opponents argue, however, that eliminating the death penalty would actually cost the government more money. Opponents say it will cost $100 million over the next four years because of the lifetime housing, food and healthcare benefits that former Death Row inmates would receive.
Another argument against repealing the death penalty center on the importance of ensuring that justice is served and taking the victims’ families into account, Jeffe said.
Steven Lam, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, also said that the serving justice is more important than cost.
“I’m more in favor of keeping the death penalty because I feel for the victims’ families,” Lam said. “The cost of having peace of mind shouldn’t matter. I think finding solace for the victims’ families is more important.”
The section with the case against the measure in the Official Voter Information Guide, for example, says that abolishing the death penalty is “indefensible, cruel to loved ones of victims, misleading and insulting to voters and dangerous for California.”
Lansky echoed this argument as a reason for opposing the proposition.
“I think about the Aurora shooting — would we be OK if he only got life in prison and not the death penalty?” Lansky said. “Unless you know someone who’s been murdered, I don’t think you can really understand.”
Prop. 34 is the latest attempt to quash the death penalty after it was suspended in 1972 and reinstated in 1978 by Proposition 7.

Professors and students gathered in Ground Zero Performance Café on Wednesday to share thoughts about the role of citizenship in today’s world. The event, called “Reimagine Citizenship,” was part of the USC Levan Institute’s ongoing  “Coffeehouse Conversations On Practical Ethics” series.
Civics · Panelists Niels W. Frenzen (left), Scott Lepisto, Michel Angela Martinez and Ron Osbourne discussed historical and modern-day activism at the Wednesday event. – Arya Harsono | Daily Trojan
Moderator Sharon Lloyd, a professor of philosophy, law and political science, began the discussion by challenging the audience to think about how prevalent activism is in today’s society.
“Are there more sources of activism now, or just slacktivism?” she said.
The panel, which featured two Dornsife professors, a law professor and two Ph.D. students, weighed in on the issue of activism for about five minutes each before opening the floor to discussion.
Ralph Wedgwood, a professor of philosophy, began by defining citizenship and putting the concept of citizenship in perspective.
“A citizen is someone who has full membership in the community. In Ancient Greece, that was limited to men who were not slaves,” Wedgwood said. Historically, he noted, citizens could only be bound to one community.
“If you’re a citizen of Athens, you’re not a citizen of Sparta,” Wedgwood said, referring to the citizenship policies of typical Western  civilizations.
Another major point in his argument was that globalization has changed the way we view citizenship. Wedgwood explained that we do not live in a world of completely sealed-off bubbles.
“What happens in one country has profound and immediate effects on other countries,” he said.
He also argued that globalization is slowly making our traditional views of citizenship irrelevant and that we are slowly moving into a world of cosmopolitan ideals.
“To be cosmopolitan is to be a citizen of the universe,” he said.
Dr. Ron Osborn of USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences agreed, sharing a story about visiting North Korea and agreeing to bow to a statue of Kim Jong-il.
Despite his concerns about North Korea being an authoritarian regime that operates on dictatorship, he explained that he bowed as a way of showing respect, not necessarily to imply worship.
“North Koreans are in fact very proud of their culture, of their history, of their identity,” he said. “Perhaps we should take that into consideration.”
From there, the conversation quickly turned to activism. Ph.D. students Michel Martinez and Scott Lepisto, who were both involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement, and encouraged students to also be activists.
“Your voice can be so much more than just a vote. Voting is such a small part of participation,” Martinez said.
Law Professor Niels Frenzen agreed, citing the positive effects of protests by immigrants in the United States. Frenzen cited the steps President Barack Obama has taken to give temporary status to some immigrants.
“The Obama administration’s response has been, in large part, due to demonstrations that have been carried out for some years,” Frenzen said, referring specifically to the 500,000-strong demonstration protesting a proposed federal crackdown on illegal immigration in 2006.
Students who attended this event said they left with a new appreciation of their roles as citizens.
Haig Nalbandian, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said he originally came to fulfill a class requirement, but ended up learning more about other cultures.
“I appreciated the topic of citizenship, and learning about the North Korean state was interesting,” Nalbandian said.
 
The next Coffeehouse Conversation, “My Body Made Me Do It!”, will occur on Oct. 24 at noon.

Royce Hall at UCLA
Set aside your grudges and head to UCLA for an evening of comedy.
Though there’s no guarantee he’ll appear mustachioed, Nick Offerman is still sure to bring the laughs Saturday night with his unique routine.
Part performer, part motivational speaker, the dry and impossibly macho actor-comedian will mix storytelling and stand-up during his set. And with the promise of minor nudity, fans of Offerman’s Parks and Recreation character Ron Swanson are surely already lining up outside of Royce Hall.

Before Tina Fey or Kristen Wiig dazzled viewers on Saturday Night Live, Lily Tomlin kept America laughing with her wacky humor and knack for delivering hilarious facial expressions.
On Saturday, one of comedy’s original funny girls takes the stage at Smothers Theater for a night of stand-up. Though the comedian is also known for her work in films like Nine to Five and her role as Ms. Frizzle on the animated television series The Magic School Bus, Tomlin plans to regale this weekend’s audience with snippets from the iconic Edith Ann and Ernestine sketches.
Tickets aren’t the cheapest, ranging from $40 to $60,  but Tomlin’s comedy- legend status guarantees a knockout performance.
Plus, with the 405 closed this weekend, a trip down the Pacific Coast Highway to Smothers Theater might not be such a bad idea.

On Aug. 13, Helen Gurley Brown — legendary editor of the so-called women’s bible Cosmopolitan Magazine — died at the age of 90.
To be honest, I had never heard of Mrs. Brown — and I’m sure that many people are in the same boat. But it’s almost impossible to ignore the impact that she had on women everywhere.
Brown became editor in chief of Cosmo in 1965, a time when a woman’s expression of sexuality, while evolving, still came down to what she cooked for dinner or how well her hair was curled.
Things have certainly gotten better, and Cosmo — with its frank depiction of sex and its status as an outlet for women to air their grievances — is certainly appreciated.
But even though women now have some level of sexual freedom, there is still a huge double standard that we have yet to overcome.
It’s not in a blatant way — no, that would too obviously contradict the “all are equal” stance that America has adopted. Instead, small actions and ideas have kept the glass ceiling well above our heads, within reach but impossible to put a crack in.
I’m not talking about women in the workplace or equality in schools. In fact, according to statistics, it has never been a better time to be a woman.
Yes, Americans currently live in a society where there are more women than men in college — 25 percent more, in fact. Yes, we are seeing more women in the workplace than ever: In 2018, it’s expected that 78 million of us will be in the labor force. Yes, we are finally seeing strong, interesting, even flawed — but at least fleshed out — female characters on the big and small screens, instead of the one-dimensional cardboard roles we’re often relegated to.
But let’s bring this back to the average 20-year-old girl and her life here at USC. Why can the average boy hook up with as many girls as he wants, but the second a girl does the same, she’s labeled a slut?
Or why is a strong, independent female student who does not want a relationship seen as a b-tch while a man is lauded for focusing on school and his future?
Why is a girl who goes out to party all the time deemed a party animal in need of “help,” while a boy is viewed simply as fun?
Unfortunately, even strong and sexy pop culture figures — such as Julianna Margulies as Alicia Florrick on The Good Wife  — haven’t been able to do much for us overall.
After all, one only needs to look back to June when Michigan State Representative Lisa Brown was barred from speaking on the floor of the Michigan State House for saying the word “vagina.”
What were the lawmakers discussing? Abortion.
So let me get this correct: A group of mostly middle-aged men were discussing abortion, and Brown — an elected official, I might add — was barred from speaking on the floor again for mentioning one of the biological parts involved in abortion?
At first glance, a little imbalance in sexual equality doesn’t seem to make a huge difference. But upon closer look, it’s easy to see that such a thing is affecting our day-to-day lives. We’re not just being called sluts on a walk of shame back from Menlo — no, women are also subjected to judgment from officials elected to protect us.
I don’t see the government holding committee hearings on male vasectomies. And regardless of my opinions on abortion, I do believe in the right to choose, the right for a woman to be able to own her body and not have it controlled by men who have no idea what she is going through.
I could go on and on about this. I could discuss the stigma attached to a girl who speaks frankly about sex and relationships, I could discuss how birth control coverage provided by the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is both vital to the individual as well as the future of America, and I could discuss how a girl should be able to do everything a boy does without being judged — by both boys and girls.
I’m not one for flagrant, out-of-control sex with everyone I know — face it, that’s just not safe for anyone. But in my attempt to judge girls who perhaps resemble the sex-crazed Samantha from Sex and the City, I’ve missed the fundamental truth of the United States of America’s Constitution: the pursuit of happiness. Are only men entitled to go out and have a good time? Negative. Just because I personally wouldn’t act like a lot of the girls at ’SC doesn’t mean that I have the right to judge them based on what makes them happy.
Seriously, every time a girl calls another girl a slut or a man forbids a woman from speaking for saying the word “vagina,” our society gets set back a few years.
No one is perfect by any means. Being flawed is what makes humanity so fascinating. But we are always given the chance to change, the chance to transform ourselves into better people overall. The next time you judge a girl, think hard about why you say certain words. Imagine a boy in her situation and see if you feel the same way.
Helen Gurley Brown once said, “Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere.” It brings a smile to my face that in her 90 years she managed to witness a complete renaissance of female sexuality. Without her heading up Cosmo, who knows where we would be now?
So you can call me a bad girl. But I only stand up for what I believe in, choosing not to live my life chained down by double standards. Call me what you want. But it doesn’t matter, because while I might not get a pass into heaven, I’ll sure enjoy my life here on earth.

After an 11-year hiatus, No Doubt is finally back with its long-awaited sixth album. During their time off, the band members dabbled in side projects and collaborations, and lead singer Gwen Stefani notably released successful solo dance-pop albums.
After lots of talk about a new (and long-overdue) album, the band has finally released Push and Shove, which is firmly in the running for the most dissatisfying album of the year.
Originally formed in 1986, No Doubt garnered attention for its unique and seamless blend of ska, punk and pop sounds. Though its eponymous first album dropped in 1992, the band didn’t gain fame until 1995’s Tragic Kingdom. Stefani’s pitch-perfect vocals and the band’s tight production complemented the genre-jumping music, and the album has remained No Doubt’s most successful, reaching Diamond certification in the United States alone.
The more mature Return Of Saturn followed in Tragic Kingdom’s gargantuan footsteps and the band’s success reached a new, more mainstream audience with 2001’s Rock Steady.
The difference between No Doubt and Rock Steady is vast — the 1992 No Doubt employs a quirky, original sound, while the 2001 No Doubt has more of a conventional pop sound. Though the band’s slow descent into the realm of Top 40 became more evident with each album, Push and Shove somehow still comes as a surprising disappointment.
Maybe it’s because the expectations were too high or because No Doubt has simply grown out of their ska-punk roots — whatever the case might be, the quartet’s new album sounds like a completely different band than the one that started out in the late ’80s, and not in a good way. Other than “Settle Down,” “Sparkle,” and the questionable title track, the ska vibe that used to define the band is completely discarded for an extremely dancey and superficial sound.
“Settle Down” might be a little too produced for die-hard No Doubt fans, but the opener is solid enough and representative of the band’s claim to fame.
What follows, however, is virtually an entire album of forgettable tracks. An overly produced club/dance sound overpowers most of Push and Shove, as with “Easy” and “Dreaming the Same Dream,” which take the listener back to the bad part of the 1980s.
The band reaches a somewhat happy balance between its roots and its new direction with “Gravity.” Though the song is super poppy, it doesn’t make you long for 1998, back when No Doubt still made great music. In regard to this album, that’s a compliment.
It’s not just the music that’s jaw-droppingly out of character for the band — it’s the lyrical frivolity. Gone is the social commentary of “Trapped In A Box,” the clever relationship woes of “Excuse Me Mr.” and “Hey You,” the witty charm of “Bathwater” and “New.” What we have now are gems like, “This is my diversion / Go ahead and stare / I’m a ragamuffin” (from “Looking Hot”).
Or how about the painfully puerile, “A cat up in a tree / Want you to get me down but I’m scared of what I’ll see / I need a private eye / To see through your disguise” (from “Undercover”)?
If you’re looking for something more profound, there’s always “Undone,” which starts with the painfully trite, “I’m broke / Let me show you where it hurts.” Stefani’s proven she can be better than this.
On a purely lyrical level, it’s hard not to wonder: How did the unique and talented singer from the original No Doubt go from the snarling, sarcastic “Just A Girl” to crooning “I’m a hustler, baby” with a straight face?
Another disappointment of the album, for that matter, are the vocals. Stefani ditched the heavy vibrato that made her inimitable and famous around the time of Rock Steady, and her once-signature voice has now evolved into whiny territory.
The fact of the matter is that No Doubt will most likely hit a new audience, which seems to be the goal. Many songs on the album sound like David Guetta B-sides; and though some might take that as a compliment, among the old-school No Doubt fan base, that’s anything but. The last bits of the band’s edge that remained on Rock Steady are all but gone now.
If Push and Shove was one of Stefani’s solo projects, the album would be mediocre, at best. But under the No Doubt banner, the album is a monumental disappointment.
It’s understandable that a group would want to evolve, but the best kind of evolution is one that doesn’t leave old fans behind. New fans will most definitely be made with this record, but for die-hard No Doubt fans, Push and Shove will stand as a meaningless statement from a once-meaningful band.
You are right on, i could not agree more with you, gwens lyrics have become empty. Return of Saturn was phenomenal- being an old skool no doubt fan this album made me cry, i wasnt sure if i was listening to Pink or katy perry. Thank you for writing this. The release of push and shove was a sad day indeed. Over produced nonsense to sell to the mainstream– too bad :(
I’ve listened to there new songs off of Push & Shove, & I actually like them. There album just came out, so how can it be a big disappointment for everyone? And besides, there trying a new sound. I like it.

A new restaurant chain has joined Five Guys Burgers and Fries in the West 27th Place Apartments on South Figueroa Street. Brooklyn Water Bagel Co., a Florida-based bagel company introduced to the Los Angeles area in 2011, opened up its new storefront at the beginning of the fall semester. The restaurant chain, which was brought to California by retired CNN television icon Larry King, utilizes a patented 14-stage water treatment system that claims to create an authentic “Brooklynized” taste for its products.
Brooklyn’s best · The latest chain opening near USC offers many varieties of bagels, but also twists on coffee and fountain beverages. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
The restaurant not only uses the water treatment for its bagels, but also its coffee, muffins and even the fountain beverages. The water on its own terms is very clean — to the point where there’s hardly anything to taste. The storefront takes great pride in the technique, proudly presenting the treatment mechanisms right as you enter the place.
The outdoor seating, situated right in front of a large sidewalk fountain, maintains a shady, peaceful vibe — though the nearby traffic intersection can be one of the noisier areas of Figueroa Corridor.
Still, the restaurant feels isolated and creates a relatively peaceful beginning to a regular school morning. Whether or not Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. can retain this vibe once the other tenants fill up West 27th Place, however, remains to be seen.
As customers enter the building, they’ll see employees folding and smashing out the dough for the bagels, which then go through a giant assembly line of cooking equipment. It’s an appreciated display of artisanship, even if it is a bit “in-your-face.” And with Brooklyn Water Bagel Co.’s retro-style advertisements, clichéd lingo and images of Larry King on every menu, the whole aesthetic of the restaurant tends to go a bit too much on the kitschy side of things. It’s the mass-produced stereotype of Brooklyn, rather than the modern hipster scene of Williamsburg that the borough has become known for — a missed opportunity, considering that one of the staples of the culture there is the appreciation of artisanship.
For all the hoopla about the water treatment, the bagels themselves are adequate, if not exceptional. After a surprisingly long wait for the food, the bagels are chewy without being gooey and crispy without being crunchy. They also aren’t as warm as might be expected. Certain bagels — such as rye, Asiago and whole-wheat — taste better with savory spreads like nova or scallions, but almost all the bagels work great with a slab of cream cheese. There’s no skimping on the toppings here, which is commendable.
Considering the prices for the bagels, Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. offers a  satisfactory deal.  The restaurant sells bagels by the half dozen as well as the cream cheese and nova salmon spread separately, so it makes for a good location for a business meeting or an early study group.
Look at the other parts of the menu, though, and the appeal quickly diminishes.  Though the Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. also offers muffins, pretzels and even giant double-sided cookies, the breakfast sandwiches, are under-seasoned and the “bagelwiches,” overstuffed. If customers aren’t fond of bagels, other restaurants might provide better options.
The standout feature of the restaurant, though, is the coffee bar. Both the hot coffee and the iced coffee are self-serve, with milk and cream dispensers and syrup pumps; customers can customize to their hearts’ content. The quality of the coffee is great, with the Canarsie Concoction (a mixture of Kahlúa syrup, caramel and vanilla) and Brooklyn’s Bravest (dark roast) as standouts.  The bar also has frozen coffee cubes, which prevent the coffee from becoming watered down.
The frozen coffee cubes and the restaurant’s other subtle details are great ideas that Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. should focus on instead of trying to sell themselves as an “authentic” Brooklyn experience. Having a customizable iced coffee bar so close to a campus should be a recipe for success; however, since the restaurant closes at 7:30 p.m., it doesn’t make for a great spot for all-nighters.
For a great start to a long day though, a Whole Wheat Everything bagel with cream cheese and an iced coffee that doesn’t water down isn’t a bad way to go.

Sitting on a white pedestal, the work of art looks more like a liquid squeezed out of a tube than a concrete sculpture.
In the all-white room, statues of a similar fashion stand atop individual pedestals, allowing museum visitors to take them in from all sides. These works come from the creative mind of recently deceased artist Ken Price and make up the current retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The exhibition presents his works from 1959 to 2011 in an impressive presentation of both his talent and his high standing in the art world.
Multiple perspectives · LACMA’s spacious arrangement of “Ken Price Sculpture: A Retrospective” offers museum-goers multiple ways of viewing the renowned sculpture artist’s creative masterpieces. – | Photo courtesy of Fredrik Nilson
Whether or not you recognize Price’s name, the exhibition manages to capture his chronological and artistic evolution. Each piece represents a distinct side of Price’s artistic imagination, and quotes from art figures, along with biographical information, help paint a more complete picture of Price that goes beyond the pieces in the show.
Though he died in February, Price worked with curator Stephanie Barron to plan the exhibition and agreed with her idea of presenting his work in an atypical order: starting with the newest pieces and ending with the oldest.
Architect Frank O. Gehry, a friend of Price, designed the space for the exhibition. Gehry, known for his alternative approaches to design, like taking inspiration from crumpled sheets of paper, didn’t just go about designing a plain space. Since Gehry owns a few selections of Price’s works, he decided to scan one work to see what it looks like inside and — voilà — it served as inspiration for the show’s interior.
When viewers enter the exhibit, the white walls might seem conventional, but the show manages to keep a variety of spaces open for easy roaming. Pedestals hold comfortably sized pieces while large-scale pieces get entire rooms to themselves. Two small corner-like rooms hold pieces similar to the Mexican pottery Price appreciated. The works stand behind a wooden fence, recalling a rustic look that might match the New Mexican environment where Price worked at one point.
With so much to work with, LACMA’s challenges lay in both communicating the artist’s importance to museum visitors who don’t know him while also displaying a collection that could survive the close scrutiny of serious art scholars and critics. But the exhibition successfully communicates Price’s importance, even to someone completely unfamiliar with him. From a small cup to a large-scale installation, Price’s distinctive humor and undeniable talent are readily apparent.
Regarding the exhibition as a whole, flaws proved minor. A section titled “The Cups” showed a group of endearing cups that stood on rather high pedestals. Though the cups definitely deserve their own attention and the long shadows underneath the pedestal add a little extra to the piece, the cups proved difficult to see for shorter visitors. LACMA normally feels welcoming to visitors of all statures, ages and handicaps, but this one part of the exhibition excludes some viewers. What’s more, the cups contain so much decoration that a 360-degree view would do them more justice. As they stand now, viewers can really only see one side.
Otherwise, the exhibition caters to a variety of museum-goers. Displayed in glass cases, in entire rooms or on pedestals, the works invite viewers to look at them at their own pace — just be sure to heed the guards’ warnings about invisible alarms measuring your distance from the free-standing pieces.
One particular quote from Price stands out from the rest of the words on the wall. In the section on Mexican pottery, Price addresses accusations that he made fun of Mexican work when he created these sculptures. With his quote, “You don’t have to act serious to be serious,” Price suggests that, despite his odd way of looking at the art form, the pottery had a great influence on him.
Perhaps Price’s ideology encompasses the exhibition as a whole. In its white-walled interior, the show might feel like a conventional museum show in which viewers must keep their voices low and scrutinize the artwork for theoretical epiphanies. But they only need to look at the sculptures to realize that their cosmic, humorous and almost otherworldly personalities call for a different experience altogether. Yes, the works deserve serious praise, but they also require the viewer to interpret them how they will.
LACMA gives art-lovers the map into Price’s history and artistic imagination. They just have to take the journey.
 
The retrospective runs until Jan. 6. LACMA is located at 5905 Wilshire Blvd.

American schools — from the elementary to college level — are struggling with a financial crisis that is leading to alarming drops in access and quality. But more importantly, none of them are in agreement about what approach is needed to find a solution.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
From Occupy Education protests that took place at UC and Cal State campuses earlier this year to the Chicago teachers’ union strike last week, students and teachers across the country are clamoring for change. In California, the upcoming election offers two very different solutions in the form of ballot measures, Propositions 30 and 38.
Protests should continue and the state measures are a step in the right direction, but a complex array of possible outcomes — whether one or both propositions pass come Election Day on Nov. 6 — as mandated by the state constitution, does not guarantee solid change. Our schools need more effective, reliable, direct relief than the current legislative process provides.
Prop. 30 and 38 are, in a sense, rival ballot measures competing for Californians’ votes. Yet they’re not totally opposing: They raise income taxes (mostly for the wealthiest 1 percent of citizens) with the aim of helping public schools. They do differ, however, on where these taxes go. Prop. 30 will send tax dollars to K-12 schools, colleges, universities and public safety programs. It will also prevent trigger cuts, or automatic spending cuts, that are built into the state budget. These cuts will mostly affect public schools. Prop. 38 will fund K-12 schools on a per-pupil basis and will not prevent trigger cuts.
So what happens if one or both pass? If Prop. 30 passes, only its promised provisions will go forward — temporary increases in sales tax and personal income taxes for certain individuals and prevention of a $6 billion trigger cut to public schools. If Prop. 38 passes, its provisions — raised income tax for anyone earning more than $17,000 a year — will go into effect. But the courts will still consider whether or not parts of Prop. 30 should be enacted as well. If both pass, the one with the most votes will take effect.
Californians should make an educated decision about which measure they support and vote for it, because nothing is going to change before Nov. 6 and some action is better than none. But there’s something fundamentally wrong with the legislative outcome of Prop. 38’s passage. What will students, teachers and administrators gain from having to wait longer for courts to decide whether or not $6 billion will be slashed from their schools’ budgets?
I’m not just saying this because I’m unusually interested in schools and education and want you to be, too. Trigger cuts mean tuition increases at UCs and Cal States, minimal class options at California community colleges, possible bankruptcy at City College of San Francisco and a loss of numerous job opportunities for those of us interested in going into teaching fields in California. That’s bad.
Education is a civil rights problem, not a political one. The reason the state is putting forward ballot measures derives from good intentions — because California’s Constitution requires a two-thirds vote requirement in the legislature and those who support both Prop. 30 and 38 know neither would get the two-thirds majority it needs — but the good intentions get lost in the political process.
More than ever, Americans are disillusioned with the federal government because crucial issues get lost in the partisan divides of Washington, but California is better than that. California’s residents and government should show the rest of the country how to move past politics to solve its education crisis.
Public schools are too important. Whether you’re a product of them, you want to work in them or you just pay taxes in California, schools remain a key part of your future. It might be too much to ask you to write a letter to your congressman or to Gov. Jerry Brown, but at least start by taking the initiative to learn about California’s political processes and what they mean for the future of education.

Money doesn’t help kids that don’t want to learn.
this article is nonsense.. Public schools budgets have exploded from the 60s untill recently where it’s gone down a bit.. throwing money at something jncreases its prices not its quality.

No one cares.  Get a life!
Like that new iphone5?  Do you know Apple has evaded paying billions in corporate income taxes to the State of California by setting up a sham 5 person office in Reno, NV? Much of those billions would have gone to fund elementary, high school, colleges and universities. They pay ZERO CA state income tax!
Maybe send a text to Apple to pay their state taxes or consider boycotting their products until they pay there fair share.

When USC instituted a new football practice policy in August barring media members from reporting injuries, it joined a number of its Pac-12 counterparts in the clampdown of information in the name of maintaining a competitive advantage.
USC now prohibits the reporting of injuries observed during in-season practices — much like conference foes, such as Oregon, UCLA and Washington, which have recently enacted similar policies. The trend is one in which journalists are discouraged and even prevented, by the threat of banned access, from reporting on certain subjects.
Though the schools establishing these measures have legitimate reasons for exercising discretion, stonewalling the media from objective, thorough reporting brings a bevy of consequences and sets a poor example for other institutions and organizations to follow.
For one, restrictions on reporting result in seemingly endless speculation and misinformation and create an environment in which accurate information and truth fall in favor of message board scuttlebutt and social media rumors. This also creates an unfair situation for fans who, as de facto stakeholders in the sports institutions they support, deserve to know accurate, up-to-date information.
Second, this trend toward non-transparency sets a dangerous precedent for the continued and selective stonewalling of media reporting beyond just athletics.
In several respects, the media represents the eyes and ears of the public and serves as watchdogs for institutions, including athletic programs and their teams. The willingness of a highly respected institution such as USC to block subjects of pertinent discussion fosters a negative attitude toward the media and further encourages organizations to present selective truths.
Where exactly is the line drawn? What happens if institutions indulge their desires to deem certain news as reportable or non-reportable? What happens to the reporters who want to ask the hard questions but are threatened to be kicked out?
As a publication looking to report the objective truth, the Daily Trojan does not agree with the continued efforts of the USC athletic department and institutions around the nation to keep publicly relevant information behind closed doors.Organizations should aim to level the playing field with transparency rather than keeping facts in the dark.
Staff editorials are determined by the editorial board. Its members include Elena Kadvany, Nicholas Slayton, Jennifer Schultz, Eddie Kim, Joey Kaufman and Sean Fitz-Gerald.
Bill, you rock, dude!
The “truth-seeking” Trojan does its own censoring, too, including of fully paid advertising, such as that which the Committee for OPEN DEBATE of the Holocaust (CODOH) would like to place in its pages.
Nope, CODOH, you can’t promote your dangerous ideas in the pages of The Trojan. Order rejected.
The Trojan plays the same games as USC, Pac-12, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and all those censors. And on matters of far greater importance, too.
Dude… get over it.
I agree with Bill.
But if you kids are really concerned about the lack of transparancy in reporting you should take a look at the President of the US, for he ran on providing transparancy in the all White House matters and in his administration and he has completely shut that down since day 1.  
Te college kids of today are known as The Debt Generation and I don’t understand why you are nojt writing your stories about Obama’s complete lack of protocol in the White House, his bypassing the Constitution ilieu of using presidential executive orders to pass push his agenda without congressional oversight, hjis lack of presidential leadership with getting a budget approved… His own party won’t pass a budget and hasn’t in 4 yrs.
You kids are missing the boat on taking care of your future.
The concern over USC’s injury reporting policies is iirrelevant in the greater scheme of things. This is not new. Most high profile FBS sthletic depts do not report injuries and are closed to the media.
Go fight anoer battle, as this one doesn’t affect your life.
The only folks who need to know the injuries list are the opponents and the odds makers in Las Vegas.
Anyone who reads the book “The Amateur” will understand why Obama has failed in so many areas and is very dangerous. The book was written by a Democrat who was the NY Times editor for 10 years and is based on interviews with over 200 people who close to Obama.
This is an incomplete and biased opinion article that results in the wrong conclusion.
It does not mention the fact that USC has had closed football practices during most of its history including the years that 9 of 11 national championships were won. 
It wrongly states that other conference foes only recently enacted similar policies prohibiting the reporting of injuries observed during in-season practices. In fact, 8 of the 12 Pac-12 schools have closed practices and several others restrict only the injury information. Many of these have had these restrictions for a long time. The only school that has open practices and doesn’t restrict injury info is Oregon State who is located in Corvalis which is of little interest to media.
The arguments used are from the viewpoint of the media.
It is a fact that many Division I football programs handle practices and reporting information differently and there is no NCAA or conference rule that requires a consistent policy, so there is a competitive disparity among programs. Most football programs assign staff to scour the internet in search of information about their opponents including injuries. This information is then used to put together game plans to take advantage of missing injured players or possibly target key players that have identified injuries.
Rather than continue to expose USC football’s team to a competitive disadvantage by sharing more information than most of its competition, Lane Kiffin instituted a policy for the media not to share competition-sensitive information such as injuries. 
Unfortunately, instead of embracing this policy in return for the privilege of attending practices, the media has chosen to act like cry-babies and attempt to make Kiffin the bad guy.
There is a simple solution so solve the real problem of inconsistent reporting and maintaining an equal and fair competitive environment. The NCAA (not a conference) should establish a standard injury reporting and media practice policy. Until that happens, schools like USC are forced to protect themselves and the media should talk about the real problem if they care.
[…] but not unprecedented.  Daily Trojan editors at the University of Southern California noted in an editorial last week, “USC now prohibits the reporting of injuries observed during in-season practices– much […]

From brutal campaign ads to personal attacks to the not-so-friendly moniker Barrack Hussein, the battlefield of politics has been particularly nasty in recent years.
Such nastiness is rooted in rigid partisanship, which has contributed to an endemic inability of lawmakers of different parties to work with one another.
In the midst of this national fiasco, the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy hosted its inaugural symposium on Monday. The symposium featured a panel discussion with politicians including Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson, which stressed the importance of, as USC President C.L. Max Nikias put it, coming together “beyond the poisonous atmosphere of partisanship.”
This is a refreshing message to hear from political figures.
Starting in 2008, progress on essential health care reform was at a standstill for months because Republicans and Democrats refused to budge from their respective platforms’ positions on the issue. Mitt Romney has been called a “perfectly lubricated weathervane” for his flip-flops on issues such as abortion, gun control and Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell—most likely so that he could adhere more closely to his party’s strict expectations.
Panelist and former Florida governor, Charlie Crist, noted how this divide extends even into the realm of basic human decency. Crist was once chewed out by fellow Republicans for hugging President Obama.
As long as political parties continue to vilify their members for attempts at cooperation, compromise and simple respect, Washington will only become more dishonest, more closed-minded and more feral. The Symposium must be the first of many high-profile assemblies to advocate against this phenomenon, or the situation will quickly worsen.
Whether the players present at the symposium will follow their own advice remains to be seen, but someone in power needs to take their words to heart—before the entire American democratic process is so divisive as to be entirely stagnant.

Only four games into the current football season, USC Director of Athletics’ Chair Pat Haden already has an eye on the future, announcing USC will add Fresno State to the football schedule in 2014.
The game holds special meaning for Trojans head coach Lane Kiffin, as he played quarterback for the Bulldogs from 1994 to 1996 and proceeded to serve as a student assistant coach after his playing days were over.
“We are excited to add Fresno State to our 2014 schedule,” Kiffin said in a press release. “The games between the teams in the past have been very competitive and have attracted lots of fans from both sides.”
The Trojans and Bulldogs have met twice, but both contests have been noteworthy with each team taking a game for themselves. In their first matchup in the 1992 Freedom Bowl, the unranked Bulldogs stunned No. 23 USC 24-7. Their most recent meeting occurred in 2005, and was one of the most memorable games of the season, with top-ranked USC scraping by the Bulldogs in a 50-42 shootout that saw tailback Reggie Bush gain a league-record 513 all-purpose yards.
Fresno State joins Notre Dame and Boston College as USC’s non-conference opponents in 2014. USC will be hosting the game on Aug. 30, 2014.

Sure, there are many trendy places that you can get your gluten-free on within the great city of Los Angeles. But in case your pockets don’t run deep enough to help support the eating habits of über-cool hipsters at the hottest cafeteria/restaurant/hole in the wall that actually costs 20 bucks per bite, or in case you don’t own a car to sit through eight hours of the typical L.A. traffic, then don’t worry — there are still plenty of options around in the trendy South Figueroa area.
Italian food is rare in Los Angeles alone — so forget about finding a restaurant that’ll serve gluten-free food around campus. But fortunately Domino’s has gluten-free crust — that’s right, Domino’s — and as any well-partied Trojan knows, delivers until 2 a.m.
Everyone’s favorite late night Mexican joint (and I’m not talking about greasy Chano’s), Freebirds, is open on weekends until 2:30 a.m. Try one of their delicious burrito bowls or tacos — on corn tortillas, of course. Be wary of the steak: this deliciously prepared meat unfortunately contains wheat according to the nutrition facts listed on their website. To make up for what you miss out in the meat department, load up on their chips. This addicting snack is sure to keep you full.
If you’re looking for a decent sit down place, then The Lab is also a great option. For a girl who hates salads, all of the salads on their menu are extremely tasty. Just make sure you always ask about nutrition information and be wary of hidden gluten, especially in dressing.
The options don’t end there. Fresh & Easy has a small section of gluten-free items, not to mention loads of prepared foods that are clearly labeled if they contain wheat or gluten products. Five Guys’ products are gluten-free, except for its buns, so go crazy with the fries.
If all else fails, do what I do. Hit up Subway at 2 a.m., get a sandwich, retreat to your room and put it on Udi’s gluten-free bread. Annoying, but oh so tasty.

The iPhone 5 has officially arrived on campus. Many students have their new toys on display in classrooms and dining halls, some still with the protective plastic wrap in place. Students with the “old” iPhone 4 are debating the relative merits of the new model.
But what about those students with no iPhone at all? For them, life at USC can be inconvenient. In today’s world, it seems necessary to have Apple’s signature device.
On campus, one of the primary reasons to have an iPhone is its social component. In the freshmen dorms, for example, students form connections with new friends through apps like Snapchat and Instagram by taking pictures and sending them to one another.
Furthermore, students are expected to be accessible by email at any given moment. Clubs and professors use email and Facebook as a way to send out last minute reminders. Without a smartphone, students risk missing these reminders altogether.
Off campus, students use smartphones to look up directions and bus schedules or download coupons for restaurants and cafes. A dead battery can induce a panic attack.
To many USC students, an iPhone is an important tool. But our generation’s dependence on iPhones is not all positive. For one thing, it creates a divide between those who have the phone and those who do not.
Many companies use QR codes and mobile apps to market to clients. Those without smartphones are essentially deemed irrelevant, as they are left out of the company’s marketing plan. Political campaigns also use these tactics, and it is not fair to ignore those who cannot afford the pricey phone.
iPhones—and smartphones in general—offer countless benefits. These benefits mainly provide opportunities to engage socially, find out about discounts or the latest news no matter where you are.
People without smartphones are not entitled to many of these opportunities. The day may come when the iPhone is cheap enough for everyone to take part in the technological revolution. In the mean time, however, the USC community should not take that luxury for granted.
Who the heck uses QR codes?

Kosal Path, a survivor of Cambodian genocide under the Khmer Rouge, spoke Tuesday at the USC Gould School of Law about the experiences of growing up in the country and his present research on social rehabilitation after mass killings.
The genocide, which occurred between 1975 and 1979, left about 1.7 million people dead at the hands of the Khmer Rouge regime headed by Pol Pot. The genocide targeted several minority groups, including ethnic and ancestral Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai Cambodians.
According to Path, Cambodians are still feeling the repercussions today. Though Path said he does not remember much from his childhood, he said he does remember not having any food. Path also remembers that his family members were forced to become refugees in Vietnam.
“People were tormented so they are not ready to face it,” he said. “It will take them time to communicate about restoring relationships between the two communities.”
After surviving the genocide, Path graduated from Phnom Penh University in Cambodia and received a master’s degree and a Ph.D. at USC in international relations. During his presentation, Plath said of USC that despite his origins, he “feel[s] at home here.” Path currently serves as a lecturer in the USC School of International Relations and a USC Shoah Foundation Fellow.
During the event, Path talked about the criminal cases involving the Khmer Rouge and said the fact that survivors were questioning the convicts in the courtroom sends a “powerful message.”
The nation still holds so much anger towards the genocide, according to Path, that many participate in “Anger Day” on May 20 each year, where people express their anger about the genocide and visit the memorial.
Path said criminals from the Khmer Rouge first attempted to blame the genocide on Vietnam and then on each other.
Natasha Immaraj, a graduate student studying public policy, said that she thought the discussion of guilt was the most interesting part of Path’s talk.
“The blame game is so typical of human nature,” she said. “They first blame the Vietnamese and then each other.”
The event also included a presentation from Hannah Garry, president of USC Law International Human Rights Clinic. Garry spoke about her involvement in a criminal case concerning the massacres.
Under the supervision of Garry, students traveled to Cambodia to assist in the conviction of the criminals responsible for the genocide.
In her presentation, Garry showed pictures of the genocide memorial and torture chambers in addition to  talking about the work the students did on the criminal cases.
Maggie Buckles, a law student who is in the International Human Rights Clinic, said that she attended the event to get a human perspective on a conflict she learned about from a technical and legal perspective.
“Seeing how society has transformed and how much work there is left to do makes the work we’re doing for the tribunals seem really important,” Buckles said. “It’s motivational.”
During the event, Path emphasized the importance of continuing to explore about genocide.
“Seventy percent of the [current] population was born after the genocide,” Path said. “I think children should have an active memory of what happened.”

On Wednesday afternoon, students and faculty members gathered in Taper Hall to hear Professor Anouar Benmalek speak about his identity as an Arab writer.
Conflict · Professor Anouar Benmalek explored balancing multiple cultural personalities at the event that Professor Olivia Harrison organized. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
In a presentation titled “From the birth announcement to the obituary: Writing as a ticket for a strange journey,” Benmalek, a professor of probability and statistics at the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Paris-Sud, discussed his experiences as a poet, journalist and writer.
Benmalek focused on his struggle to define himself amid multiple identity markers. Born in Algeria to an Algerian Nationalist father and an American mother, Benmalek also had a Swiss grandmother, African grandmother, Bavarian great-grandmother and Mauritanian great-grandmother. His heritage forced Benmalek to learn how to reconcile Western and Eastern, as well as Islamic and Christian, cultures.
“‘To be or not to be an Arab,’ Hamlet of Algeria would ask himself,” said Benmalek, who struggled with his Arab identity after his books were published.
His novel Oh Maria, a love story set after the fall of Moorish Grenada, was denounced as sacrilegious by Muslims, who proceeded to threaten his life to the point that he left his home on the suggestion of French security.
Originally just a mathematician, Benmalek “fell in love with a girl and had no way to seduce her as a mathematician,” so he began writing poetry. He has now published eight novels, three of which have been translated into English, and countless short stories.
Benmalek, who was born during the Algerian War of Independence, spent his early life dedicated to fighting for democracy in his homeland. In 1989, Benmalek helped found the Algerian Committee Against Torture, an organization through which he co-edited the October Blackbook, based on the testimony of more than 250 civilians tortured by the state.
Though he now permanently resides in France, Benmalek continues to question Arabs’ attitude towards human rights.
“For me the most terrible [thing] is the observation that in the Arab world, the aspiration to a democratic land is not yet a natural reflex,” he said.
The speech was organized by Olivia Harrison, a professor of Mediterranean studies in the Department of French and Italian at USC. She worked with Sheila Walker of the Intercollegiate Department of Africana Studies to have Benmalek, who has been visiting college campuses across the United States, come to USC.
Harrison said she was originally “delighted at the opportunity to be able to invite him,” but it wasn’t until later that she “discovered his novels, which are beautifully written and they’re real page turners.”
Some students, like freshman pyschology major Caroline Cannan, applauded Benmalek’s bravery in speaking out.
“It was interesting how comfortable he was talking about such difficult experiences that he’s been through, and how he’s really grown from them,” Cannan said.
Undecided freshman Jack Koppa also said he enjoyed attending the event.
“It’s an opportunity that USC has that I think is important to take advantage of,” Koppa said. “It’s a cooler thing to spend time on than homework.”

USC is well known for its steep price tag, but a great number of the students who attend the university don’t end up paying the full $64,034 bill.
Though some students receive aid through merit-based scholarships, others benefit from receiving aid in the form of university grants, federal and state grants and loans.
Trends among students have shown, however, that financial aid is not consistent for all four years.
Cynthia Wang, a sophomore majoring in biochemical engineering, is paying more for her sophomore year than she did for her freshman year.
“Even though my subsidized [loan] amount increased, the tuition and fees I need to pay also increased,” Wang said. “So I actually ended up paying more than I did last year.”
Each year, new and continuing students are expected to complete the College Scholarship Service Profile and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to determine their eligibility for aid in the form of university grants, the federal Pell Grant, student loans and work study.
Thomas McWhorter, dean of financial aid at USC, said the forms provide the university with a year-to-year snapshot of a family’s financial situation.
“The students apply every year and we review their circumstances,” McWhorter said. “The way we assess a financial aid package, the first thing we look at is the amount of need.”
Using the data provided from the FAFSA and CSS Profile, the university is able to calculate the estimated family contribution. It then subtracts the EFC from the cost of attendance in order to determine the family’s demonstrated need. Additional forms, like those explaining special circumstances, such as job loss or wage reduction, can also be submitted.
Despite the thorough system, there remains concern over how reflective the financial aid packages are of family situations from year to year, especially in light of changing circumstances. McWhorter said that family contribution is the amount that the student and the family must contribute.
While there might be no change in EFC, the amount the student is expected to contribute typically increases each year. The subsidized Stafford loans a student is eligible for, however, typically increase as well, starting with $3,500 as freshman and increasing to $4,500 as a sophomore and $5,500 for juniors and seniors.
“Cost of attendance may increase,” McWhorter said. “But the loan amount will increase too.”
Though the loan amount might increase, Wang said she believes that an increase in tuition should be reflected in the amount of aid students receive.
“I just wish that the amount of aid I get would be proportional to the tuition increase, so I’m paying the same each year instead of paying more and more each year,” Wang said.
The risk of being unable to pay as a result of reduced aid is a serious threat for many students currently benefiting from financial aid.
For students like Autumn Battani, a freshman majoring in psychology, financial aid was the reason they chose to come to USC.
“If I didn’t get the financial aid package I got, I wouldn’t have been able to afford it,” Battani said.
The same is true for Desmond Dizon, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, who said a generous financial aid was a deciding factor in choosing USC, even though it was also his top choice.
In Dizon’s case, a decrease in financial aid would be a particular hardship since he is paying for college on his own.
“It’s important that I receive as much as possible because I’m paying for college with my own money,” Dizon said. “If my aid decreased, I would have to think about more loans and I’d have to work more hours over the summer to afford it.”
According to the department of financial aid, the most common reason for aid deductions is a change in family circumstances, such as an increase in salary. Additionally, there might be some reduction in the amount of grant money received in the necessary financial aid forms are submitted past the deadline.
Despite the anticipated increase in EFC, students should expect to pay from year to year, the Department of Financial Aid points out it works with students to make adjustments.
“We have the Stafford loans and private financing, though we don’t generate a lot of private loans for out students since we have pretty good financial aid packages,” McWhorter said. “We sit down with our families to see what options they have.”
Though the university aims to meet 100 percent of undergraduate students’ financial need, only 2.2 percent of undergraduate scholarship aid comes through endowment. The majority of the funds comes from the university’s unrestricted operating funds as well as other external sources such as student loans. In order to keep up with the increasing financial need among students, President C. L. Max Nikias has set a $1 billion goal for the financial aid department’s funding campaign.
“The university has a very strong commitment to the financial aid program,” McWhorter said. “We have an increase in the amount of funding, which is important since the state resources are decking and we are not sure what is going to happen with the federal Pell Grant.”
One of the present issues the $1 billion initiative hopes to address is the issue of students graduating with too many loans, a burden that could hinder their post-graduate plans. For Battani, though only a freshman, financial strains in her post-graduate future are already looming.
“I can’t do something that’s not financially possible for my family,” Battani said. “I would like to do all four years of my undergrad here, but not at the expense of being in debt for the rest of my adult life.”
Dizon, however, is optimistic. He said he is confident that he’ll be able to afford the cost of tuition without accumulating too much debt.
“I’m really appreciative of the aid I receive,” Dizon said. “I’m fully confident that I’ll be able to pay off the debt I will have acquired throughout the years because of USC’s great academic programs. It motivates me to work hard in order to afford it.”

A Los Angeles-area man who allegedly robbed four USC students at gunpoint pleaded no contest to two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of assault with a semiautomatic firearm Tuesday, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office.
Jeremy Hendricks, 24, was sentenced to 20 years in state prison by Judge Melissa Widdifield.
Hendricks allegedly robbed two male and two female USC students at gunpoint on 28th Street near Figueroa Street in April.
The students complied with Hendricks’ demands for their property after they saw his gun.
After stashing the students’ belongings in his backpack, Hendricks ran away from the students toward 30th Street.
The two male students ran after Hendricks, flagging down officers from the Los Angeles Police Department as they ran. Dept. of Public Safety officers on patrol confronted Hendricks on 30th Street.
When the officers saw that Hendricks was armed, they fired a single shot that wounded him in the leg. LAPD officers then took Hendricks into custody.
At the time of his arrest, Hendricks was on probation for possession of a deadly weapon.
In exchange for his plea, the remaining charges against Hendricks, which include attempted robbery, assault with a firearm, possession of a firearm by a felon and carrying a loaded firearm with prior convictions, were dropped.
Hey, it slowed the dude down.
too bad the cops can’t aim and failed to kill the thug
Not sure that “allegedly” is required after he pleaded guilty.

Mikhail Vinaykin, a Ph.D. candidate studying chemistry, died Tuesday morning in an accident after witnesses reported seeing his motorcycle lose control at a high speed and collide with a streetlight pole on Exposition Boulevard.
Crash · Mikhail Vinaykin’s accident occurred Tuesday morning on Exposition Boulevard near Figueroa Street. The Los Angeles Police Department closed the street to investigate the collision. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
 
He was the sole rider on the motorcycle, according to Lt. Jim Cummings, acting commanding officer of Los Angeles Police Department’s South Traffic Division.
Vinaykin was born in Russia and sent abroad for his studies, according to a statement released by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“Misha was a uniquely talented young scientist, a rising star already recognized by the international scientific community for his research,” incoming Dornsife Dean Steve A. Kay said in a statement released Tuesday night. “His colleagues and peers were fortunate to share his contagious enthusiasm for knowledge, and he was loved and respected as a teaching assistant by undergraduate students at USC.”
Cummings said Vinaykin was non-responsive when paramedics arrived and was pronounced dead at the scene.
The South Traffic Division is charged with investigating the incident, which occurred west of Figueroa Street at approximately 9:40 a.m. Tuesday, according to USC Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
Cummings said Tuesday evening that detectives from his department would continue to investigate the crash by collecting and examining evidence in addition to following up and locating more witnesses. The division is also working to determine whether any security cameras near USC contain footage of the incident, Cummings said.
Lynette Merriman, senior associate dean for Student Affairs, said the university was deeply saddened by the loss.
“I can tell you any time we lose a student at USC, it’s a huge loss for the entire Trojan Family,” Merriman said. “Any time we have a tragedy like this, this is a time we have to come together to support one another because it affects all of us.”
Vinaykin’s parents, who live in Russia, plan to join the university in a few days for a celebration of his life, according to the statement.
Students and faculty affected by the loss can seek counseling from Student Counseling Services or the Center for Work and Family Life.
