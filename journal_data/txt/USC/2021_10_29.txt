Underneath banners celebrating USC’s homecoming weekend, professors and students held signs reading “Rapists and rapist frats off campus now!” for the “Save our Students” rally following last week’s sexual assault and drugging reports at fraternity houses on the Row.
Along Trousdale, the group of more than 25 professors and students marched under a “USC Homecoming” banner to the steps of Bovard where they chanted “Ethical leadership now,” “Proactive, not pro-optics” and “Let’s see the reports,” the latter which references the lack of transparency surrounding the former gynecologist George Tyndall’s sexual abuse. 
Amelia Jones, vice dean of academics and research of the Roski School of Design, said she attended the protest to support students and address the divide between the USC Board of Trustees, administration and “everybody actually on campus.” The divide, Jones said, comes down to a lack of communication from administration and the Board’s focus on fundraising.
“This is really just one of many issues that speak to the real divide between the administration and everybody actually on campus,” Jones said. “I just want there to be communication so that they understand what it is we do. And I don’t see that happening.”
As students and professors chanted, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Zukoski came outside and spoke with protesters about the Department of Public Safety’s crime notices and USC’s handling of sexual assault reports throughout the past several years.
Protesters suggested to Zukoski that if eliminating fraternities is a way to stop sexual violence, the University should take that step.
“There’s sexual violence all over the place. It’s disgusting what we face,” Zukoski said, adding that the University is not looking into abolishing Greek life. “I’m certainly not defending the fraternity and the Greek society, all I’m saying is this is a deeply problematic issue for all of our culture and society. It isn’t just the Greek system on campus, it’s spread throughout our society and it’s abhorrent.”
A student also asked Zukoski about increasing campus sexual assault resources, including increasing funding to the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center and creating a rape crisis center.
“For years, students have been asking for rape crisis center in the main Engemann Student Health Center,” they said. 
“I’m agreeing, and it is being looked at. What I’m trying to point out is it’s more complicated,” Zukoski said and added that there is a long certification process for rape centers. 
Further pressed by protesters about making changes to Greek life, Zukoski said removing fraternities’ certification could lead to underground organizations that are less regulated.
“What we could do is decertify. But that doesn’t mean that the organizations go away. At other institutions that I’ve been at — when you decertify a fraternity or a sorority, they can continue just fine throwing parties and recruiting members,” Zukoski said. “So that’s one of the reasons why — not just USC — but other institutions continue to want to work with these groups, because at least if they’re certified by us, we can impose some rules.”
Donald Bohlinger, a cinema professor at USC for 35 years, said he attended the protest to support students and because of his longstanding concerns about seuxal assault at the University. 
“[The protest] is about many things, and it’s been a long time coming,” Bohlinger said. “It’s time to have a real conversation about all of these issues, and about how we address what’s been happening on this campus for too long.”
At around noon, students and professors gathered in the lawn of Cactus Garden One National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries for a Gender Studies faculty forum on sexual violence to work toward addressing sexual assault issues at the University.
Faculty members listened as students shared their stories of negative experiences with Greek life, sexual assault and demands for reform. 
Karen Tongson, the chair of the gender and sexual studies department, said she wanted to provide a forum for students to “express their concerns and rage,” and the “lack of accountability that they feel” from the University. 
“There are so many students who aren’t having their needs addressed,” Tongson said. This was sorely needed. As much as I’m glad that there were many people who felt safe coming here, I am very upset and disappointed to know that so many of our students feel unmoored and unsupported.”
Kathleen Loftus, a senior majoring in philosophy and comparative literature who attended the event outside Bovard, said, in her time at USC, she’s witnessed numerous scandals, many that have involved sexual assault. Loftus said she appreciates the “solidarity with students and professors” during today’s protest.
“One of my professors was talking about this in class, and it was the first time I’d heard someone in the faculty speaking about it,” Loftus said. “I felt very heard, and I’m very grateful that the faculty also have their issues and we can all support each other.”

After three dates were rescheduled due to the coronavirus pandemic, The Strokes finally landed in Los Angeles Wednesday night and The Forum buzzed with excitement. The band’s name, projected above the venue’s famous red and white architecture, welcomed concert–goers with open arms. 
Whether it be Gen Z clutching White Claws in their leather jackets or middle-aged couples on a date night past their bedtime, the arena was filled with both new and old fans, brought together by their love of the ever elusive, New York-based band.
Just before the band was (fashionably) late to hitting the stage of the sold-out show, the venue was lit with the flashes of iPhones as fans endured the anticipation of watching roadies set up mic stands and audio technicians fine-tune the tone of the guitars and bass. 
And, just like that, making no time for long, dramatic entrances, the lights went out and The Strokes emerged, with lead singer Julian Casablancas, sporting a black, denim-on-denim outfit and somehow making a mullet haircut a symbol of effortless coolness.
As the beginning strums of one of their lesser known tracks, “Call it Fate, Call it Karma,” played and as Casablancas nonchalantly slipped into the first line of lyrics, the crowd erupted with pure excitement as the long-awaited show they’ve had tickets for years now finally began.
“So, where were we?” Casablancas said. “Two years ago, before we got so rudely interrupted.”
As the band jumped into “Bad Decisions,” the second single off of their latest and most revolutionary album, “The New Abnormal,” the arena became infused with the vibes of an ‘80s-esque radio hit that got people jumping and dancing without a care in the world. 
A giant screen behind the stage displayed a hallway with curved ceilings, illuminating a warm, burnt orange to match the lighted bars of the stage lights in sync with the wistfulness of the single.
Following iconic tracks such as “Juicebox” and “Someday,” the band made their live debut of “At the Door,” an angsty, synth-filled song off of their new album that showcased the hauntingly nostalgic voice of Casablancas, his live vocals penetrating the audience with a sentiment that tugged at its heartstrings. 
Halfway through the concert, complaining of the dense heat of the lights, Casablancas took off his denim jacket to reveal a surprisingly shiny top. 
“Not purposefully trying to show off my LA Kings shirt,” he said. 
Despite his shy demeanor and minimal movement around the stage, Casablancas’ unsuspecting comedic breaks and incredible vocal range left nothing to be desired. Compiled with electrifying guitar riffs and bass solos, The Strokes as a live band resembled celebrated rockstars of the past. At the same time, they exhibited a refreshingly modern sound and message for rock enthusiasts today. 
Fans were in for a treat as legendary tracks like “Is This It,” “Hard to Explain” and “Reptilia” played one after another, leaving the audience with little room to recuperate as they sang every word to each song at the top of their lungs. 
But, before the band performed its most recognizable song, “Last Nite,” to end its main set, it played one of their new songs, “Ode to the Mets,” a track that resonates now more than ever because of its melancholy symbolism surrounding the end of an era. 
“The old ways at the bottom of / The ocean now has swallowed / The only thing that’s left is us / So pardon the silence that you’re hearing,” sang Casablancas, his delicate falsetto perhaps signaling fans to look toward the future as a past of concert cancellations is forgotten. 
To cap their performance, The Strokes chose “New York City Cops,” one of the band’s older, early 2000’s songs. Casablancas shouted, “[Los Angeles Police Department] too!” in the middle of the lively song’s lyrics, “New York City Cops, but they ain’t too smart.”
As if paying homage to and embracing the return of the “rock show,” the floor of the venue finished off the night with one hell of a mosh pit. And, as the band exited the stage without one final word, The Strokes left the crowd to bask in the reverb of thrown-down guitars and the fading cheers of awestruck fans.

Halloween is fast approaching and as a self-proclaimed horror junkie and media-obsessed School of Cinematic Arts student, October is one of my favorite times to dole out recommendations. Streaming services are rife with suggestions of media perfect for spooky season, but here’s a curated list of some of the best horror films and television shows available to stream (for the most part) this Halloweekend.
“The Haunting of Hill House” — Netflix
We’re starting off strong with the first installment of Mike Flanagan’s “The Haunting” anthology series: “The Haunting of Hill House.” This season, adapted from Shirley Jackson’s novel of the same name, follows the Crain family as they move into the titular Hill House to renovate and sell it. But trouble soon arises as the Crain family runs into paranormal encounter after paranormal encounter. “The Haunting of Hill House’’ is teeming with jump scares, ghosts and twists to keep you terrified, but also a resounding message about the importance of family that makes it just as sad as it is terrifying. Victoria Pedretti and Oliver Jackson-Cohen’s performances as the Crain twins, Nell and Luke, are some of the most moving performances in modern television. If you’re ready to scream, cry and sometimes even laugh, add this to your Netflix queue. 
“The Conjuring” — HBO Max
Inspired by the experiences of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, the “based on a true story” tagline makes this film all the more frightening. “The Conjuring” follows the Perron family as they experience supernatural occurrences in their new Rhode Island home and reach out to the Warrens for help. As the Warrens try to decipher what’s going on with the house, tensions rise and stakes get higher. This one isn’t for the faint of heart, so if you’re new to the horror scene, maybe start off with something a little tamer. Oh, and a warning: after watching “The Conjuring,” try not to get too scared when you hear somebody clap.
“The Host” — Amazon Prime Video, Youtube and Hulu
Monster film “The Host” comes from the mind behind the critically acclaimed thriller “Parasite,” South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho. “The Host” is one of Bong’s earliest films and follows a man’s harrowing endeavors to rescue his daughter from a monster terrorizing the city. With a mixture of countrywide paranoia, a dysfunctional family and a monster, Joon-Ho critiques the United States government. This film, too, is based on a real event. In 2000, a South Korean morgue official working for the U.S. Army was directed to dump copious amounts of the harmful chemical, formaldehyde, down the drain. The socio-political commentary ensures that this film not only unsettles but also educates you. 
“The Cabin in the Woods” — Available for rent
OK this one isn’t available to stream for free, but trust me when I say it is a must watch. It took me two viewings to fully appreciate “The Cabin in the Woods” for the masterpiece it is, and now I feel responsible for sharing it with anybody who will listen. The Joss Whedon-directed film toes the line between comedy and horror in a way so masterful that half the time you can’t decide if you want to hide behind the covers or laugh. “The Cabin in the Woods” follows a group of college students who decide to vacation at a — you guessed it — cabin in the woods and, naturally, they start dropping like flies. By leaning into some horror tropes and subverting others, the film offers a salient parody of the horror genre and all its ridiculous conventions.
“Us” — FXNOW
Jordan Peele’s second foray into the horror genre occurred in 2019 with the unsettling film “Us.” The film plunges us into a world where, out of nowhere, doppelgängers pop up across the U.S. and begin sadistically murdering their “tethered.” Peele also takes inspiration from a real-world event, the Hands Across America 1986 demonstration in which more than five million people attempted to create a human chain across the continental U.S. This one will definitely keep you on guard around anybody holding a pair of scissors, wearing a red jumpsuit — or worse, both. 
“Black Mirror: Playtest” — Netflix
A single episode rather than an entire series, “Playtest” from Netflix’s satirical anthology “Black Mirror’’ is one of the show’s most disturbing installments. This episode stars Wyatt Russel as Cooper, a jaded young man who participates in a “playtest” of an augmented reality game that accesses and targets your fears for some quick cash. He realizes he’s in for more than he’s bargained for as the game seems to grow more and more unsettling and realistic. This one will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat with each and every twist. 
“Hush” — Netflix
Rounding out the list is another Mike Flanagan work: “Hush.” “Hush” features many of the director’s frequent collaborators, including his wife and actor Kate Siegel — who also co-wrote the film — as main protagonist Maddie Young. Young, a horror author, is deaf and mute and lives in a remote house in the woods far from the hustle and bustle of city life. As she attempts to write a follow up to her successful novel — which has the same plot as Flanagan’s most recent Netflix contribution “Midnight Mass” — she is targeted by a masked murderer. Maddie’s quick thinking makes her an excellent protagonist, as she makes decisions that actually make sense — something novel for the horror genre. Check this one out and then get ready to stream everything else Flanagan has to offer.

In light of recent events with Sigma Nu and the recent reports of sexual assault and drugging, I felt compelled to write this piece. As a self-proclaimed fashion guru and fashion enthusiast, I find it impossible to ignore the implications of clothing, especially as a young woman. Clothing and dressing up are universal experiences for all people regardless of gender identity, as clothing is an external form of self-expression. But, as I continued to get catcalled on streets or men slowing down their cars to honk, dressing up became harder for me because of one disgusting phrase: “She was asking for it.”
I love identifying as a woman, but it is a scary world to be a female. I’m often expected to be “less than,” to fit into one of four or five molds, and I am seen as a target that needs protection from everything that comes my way, whether it is a squirrel crossing the street or a man coming toward me. 
It hurts that every time I walk alone, day or night, I frequently have to check behind me.
It hurts that, when I walk, I have to always take note of what street I’m on, what stores are near me and who looks like they would help me if anything happened in that exact second.
It hurts that all of my conversations with my female friends at night end with “Share your location with me.” 
But also, as someone who has been able to discover myself through fashion, it hurts that I am always scared that what I wear will lead to something bad happening to me, whether it is harassment, assault or kidnapping. 
The ghastly, revolting phrase “She was asking for it” is usually used when the attacker claims that the victim’s clothing implied they wanted whatever assault — verbal or physical — to happen to them. It takes the humanistic quality and universal rights of the ability to consent out of the picture, claiming that fabric, instead, sent the victim’s true message. No means no, and my skirt, dress, shirt, socks, shoes, scarves, hat or hair tie are not saying otherwise.
This is where the female gaze comes into play. Recently, I have seen a lot of transformation videos of women starting to dress for the female gaze and not the male gaze. While this term is most often heard when discussing film or Instagram feeds, it also applies to fashion. The female gaze is about women dressing up and looking good for themselves and other women around them, instead of for male desire. Unlike the male gaze, dressing for the female gaze promotes personal and communal enjoyment — that is, that of women as a group. 
Keep in mind, oftentimes dressing for the male gaze is not intentional. In an age of continued sexualization of women in film, social media standards and other forms of media, I grew up dressing for the male gaze and did not even realize until I learned about the female gaze. Only then did I start becoming more conscious of what I was buying, if I truly enjoyed what I was wearing for me and how clothes then would help me discover myself and grow. 
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying you can’t dress in a way that makes you feel sexy or dress in a way that is desirable to men. I am calling to instead dress in a way that you want to, by you and for you. If you want to feel cute, feel cute. If you want to feel sexy, hell yeah, feel sexy. 
The female gaze and I just want you to feel you. 
Unfortunately, only in a utopian society where sexual assault and harassment doesn’t exist will people stop catcalling and harassing — and yes, women do it too, I’m not saying that we don’t. But as we continue to fight these injustices, remember that you are strong; you are beautiful; you are doing okay and most importantly: It’s not a “you” problem. It’s them.

Members of the Graduate Student Government handed out T-shirts at a table set up with two large posters reading “I stand with immigrants” at Hahn Plaza Thursday. The event aimed to celebrate immigrants’ achievements, bring awareness to their contributions to the United States and advocate for policy changes to support immigrants for the I Stand with Immigrants College & University Day of Action. 
According to its website, the I Stand With Immigrants Initiative, powered by FWD.us, “empower[s] immigrants and their allies to share stories and drive action that demonstrate immigration is good for our communities, economy, and country.” 
Ramatoulaye Ouattara, a graduate student studying molecular microbiology and immunology at Keck School of Medicine, was one of the organizers as the director of globalization and inclusion in GSG. Ouattara, an immigrant herself, moved from Côte d’Ivoire to New Jersey as a teenager. 
“I decided to be part of this position because it is my way of giving back,” Ouattara said. “It is my way to advocate for immigrants, for [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival] students, for international students for them to be able to know that there’s somebody that’s standing beside them, somebody that is willing to help them.” 
Ouattara is an advocate for DACA, a policy that allows undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children to work in the country. Although Ouattara does not know any USC DACA recipients personally, she wants to find out how she can support this community, especially on their journey to citizenship. 
Pratik Nyaupane, a doctoral student at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, came to support the initiative because one of the founders of the I Stand With Immigrants campaign was a guest speaker in his civic media class. Nyaupane, an immigrant as well, came to the U.S. when he was three years old on his parents’ student visa. 
“While I’m fortunate enough to have privilege, to have a certain status, I know a lot of my peers don’t. For a lot of young children that come here at a young age, this is the only place they know, their family’s here, this is their home,” Nyaupane said. “It’s terribly unfortunate and cruel for the United States or other people or policies to say that this is not where you’re from, or not where you belong, just because of a piece of paper and so I stand in solidarity with all my undocumented folks.”
Nyaupane said he hopes that community and solidarity can form in support of undocumented students. He said he is willing to create space and promote dialogue about these issues for real change to happen. 
In Ouattara’s experience, she faced hardships, such as bullying, when her family came to the U.S. as refugees in the midst of Côte d’Ivoire’s civil war. She said it was tough to learn a new language, go to a new school and leave most of her family back home.
“I was a ninth grader. I never experienced bullying or any other type of thing back home. But, then, when I came here it was like, ‘You’re having an accent,’ ‘You’re being different,’ then people feels like it is a threat to them,” Ouattura said. “But I ended up having some friends that stood up for me, I will say.”
Jamie Cabrera, a graduate student at Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, came to the U.S. as a baby and was previously undocumented. After living in the U.S. for the majority of her life, Cabrera found that navigating higher education was particularly difficult because of the lack of services and resources available to undocumented families. 
“First and foremost, the [U.S.] was founded on the work of immigrants,” Cabrera said. “Coming here isn’t an easy decision. Nobody wants to come over and just be discriminated against and …  hurt in every situation … We should just be empathetic and understanding and take some time to listen to people’s stories.”
Cabrera said obtaining a lawyer to start the immigration process is difficult and expensive, which can make the legal process a “huge strain” on low-income families. 
“I became a citizen when I was 21,” Cabrera said. “I had been declined citizenship twice, so it was really [hard] going to court and having to explain why you belong here is always really weird for anybody to do.” 
Growing up, Cabrera went to a predominantly white public school in northern California. Sharing her immigration status with her peers was not always a positive experience for her; she said people told her “If you’re undocumented, you shouldn’t be able to access public schools in the U.S. because you don’t belong here.”
Cabrera believes it is important to host events like I Stand With Immigrants so immigrants with different experiences can be comfortable, unafraid and have a place in the U.S. 
“I think it’s important to have events like this, especially [at] USC, where it’s a predominantly white institution,” Cabrera said. “Things like this show support to the different populations, diverse populations that we have here on campus.”

While on my way to my first class of the morning, the buzz of my phone is a familiar and endearing feeling. Since high school, I always get the same message from my Mom, who usually works through the morning and leaves before I come back from class.
Ingat, mahal kita. This common phrase translates to “Stay safe, I love you,” but reading it in Tagalog makes it feel so much more special. 
However, I often fear that I may lose touch with such a beautiful language as I become more and more integrated into American culture. 
Tagalog and its many dialects are the cornerstone and pathway to understanding Filipino heritage and culture. With early Indigenous tribes using oral tradition as their main form of communication, the inability to simply understand Tagalog can be detrimental in exploring Filipino culture and coming to grips with traditions such as Simbang Gabi, also known as the “Night Mass.” 
Many words and phrases do not easily translate into English or other widely-known languages. For instance, everyday conversations between Filipinos include words such as kilig and pikon, words that only bring about more confusion in translation. 
For many second-generation Filipinos, however, it’s easy to garner an appreciation for the staples of a Filipino’s daily life, such as food, music and soap operas. But, dismissal from Filipino friends and family members is an unnecessary painful consequence of not knowing Tagalog. 
Language barriers should not prevent the new generation of Filipino-Americans — myself included — from retaining our culture because of certain barriers. Sure, language connects a person to their self-identity and allows them to participate in civic responsibilities, but it should not hinder us from exploring our family and heritage. 
For Filipinos, Tagalog symbolizes resilience and survival in the face of oppression and assimilation. For Filipino-Americans, this symbol of overcoming the odds could, in fact, be the odds themselves. Even beyond the Philippines, as many immigrant groups suffer through similar experiences as their language slowly fades away from assimilation and Westernization, a new generation of immigrant children experience an identity crisis. 
The growing population of Filipino Americans, like many immigrant groups who journey to the United States, struggle with balancing the two identities present in the name itself: Filipino heritage and Western culture. Tagalog’s popularity has certainly grown in American households — ranking third in foreign languages spoken in the U.S., which has the highest concentration of Filipinos in the world outside of the Philippines. 
Whether born in the Philippines or the U.S., Filipino Americans share a similar set of beliefs and attitudes toward their newfound home. But, an important differentiating factor between the two groups is American-born Filipinos’ curiosity to explore a missed-out-on culture.
This identity crisis divides the household based on familial values, the value of education and the appreciation of Philippine culture. Picture going to a family gathering or birthday party and not knowing anything happening — it’s your family, people that you know and respect speaking in a language beyond your knowledge. 
As mentioned before, one of the most heartbreaking losses accompanying Tagalog’s absence is alienation from older adults and family members. I remember experiences like this when I was younger and could not completely understand Tagalog, as many relatives would tease me for being “fake” or refer to me as “the American.” 
For many Filipino Americans, this confusion and stigma eventually distances younger generations from family altogether. Consequently, they assimilate with American culture, something within their grasp. 
Even those Filipino Americans who deliberately choose to investigate and understand their own culture encounter a new and increasingly relevant roadblock — the lack of education relating to Tagalog and Filipino culture in upper division American education. Even at the high school and middle school levels in the Philippines, the absence of educational resources is evident. We miss out on the true meaning of being Filipino by not learning Tagalog. This shared, yet misunderstood, sentiment can lead to the loss of Filipino tradition and culture, ironically enough in the U.S.’ “melting pot.” 
We even rationalize why these losses occur. For Filipinos who migrate and live in America, the American Dream must not be lost in vain, even at the expense of culture and tradition. In the business world, it’s uncommon for many companies to actively search for a candidate who speaks Tagalog, even with the demographic statistics provided above. It makes sense that Filipino parents would want their children to learn languages, such as German, French and Japanese, that would economically benefit family and personal income.
Filipino Americans continue to struggle with the balance of melding experiences and defying expectations, yet they created their own identity. Immigrants, on one hand, should encourage their children to familiarize themselves with their mother tongue; however, they should also welcome these children to their surrounding culture. The creation of “Taglesh” and the establishment of Filipino-American communities are testaments to the success of our community here in the U.S. for years to come. 
Immigrant communities in the U.S., sadly, constantly struggle with assimilation and accommodation, with their language and heritage sacrificed for success in the new world. But it simply does not have to be that way, so long as we make resources available to encourage intergenerational conversation. However, we cannot just rely on others to make these opportunities available for all. 
A few decades down the line when I’m celebrating Filipino American Heritage Month with a new generation of Filipino Americans, I’ll look back and say, “Back in my day…”

On Oct. 11, DC Comics announced that Superman will be bisexual in their upcoming comic series “Superman: Son of Kal-El.” While he is not the first superhero to identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community, Superman is arguably the most prominent one yet. 
Because the comic book world is such an influential place, this Superman iteration is a great step forward for the LGBTQ+ community — by making a popular superhero such as Superman bisexual, DC gives LGBTQ+ people the opportunity to see themselves in superhero comics, an area they historically have been underrepresented in. 
With this move, DC increased representation perfectly. Rather than recycle an old storyline or use a lesser known character, they crafted a fresh storyline and utilized a character that spearheads DC Comics and perhaps is the most popular superhero of all time. 
In 2020, Americans voted him as their favorite superhero. This result is surprising since Marvel superheroes have dominated the cinematic world for the last decade. DC releases movies as well, including 2013’s “Man of Steel” starring Henry Cavill as Superman, but it does not experience the same level of financial success and critical acclaim compared to Marvel. 
While popularity is a fundamental aspect of a superhero, it does not supersede the story’s importance — here is where DC hits a home run. 
This iteration is not the classic Superman storyline following Kal-El/Clark Kent, the Kryptonian who migrates to Earth after his home planet’s destruction, but rather, it follows his son, Jonathan Kent. Unlike his father, Jonathan is already integrated into humanity, making his story much more relevant and representative of today’s world. 
Jonathan Kent stands up for his political beliefs and openly expresses his environmental concerns. The series will dive into stories about how he extinguishes wildfires caused by climate change, stops a school shooting and protests against the deportation of refugees in Metropolis — Superman’s home city. 
While upholding these responsibilities, Jay Nakamura, Jonathan’s best friend, holds him down. Superman feels like he has to protect the whole world, but who is there to protect him? Jay is the one person who can. DC comics released an image of Jonathan and Jay sharing a kiss in this upcoming comic series, revealing the evolution of their relationship. 
DC’s courage to take this iconic character in this direction is admirable. It is also important to note that DC did not recycle an already used Superman storyline and just swapped sexualities. It put effort toward writing a brand new one. For the LGBTQ+ community, this is a great win because it allows the new Superman and his story to be unique to them. 
In the early 20th century, homosexual characters in movies were written solely for comical relief or humor. Hollywood called this archetypal character a “sissy.” Viewers laughed at a man who adopted “feminine” behaviors. 
Later, the gay rights movement picked up steam in the 1940s. Instead of listening to the LGBTQ+ community’s concerns, the film industry rebelled against them. Many writers started portraying gay and lesbian characters as dangerous and violent. For instance, the book and film “The Maltese Falcon” labels the villain as a “weak and unsure” queer. Meanwhile, the protagonist is hetereosexual, strong and confident. 
Moreover, a lack of accurate representation of the LGBTQ+ community is not just an issue of the 20th century. It continues today. 
As recently as 2016, the film “Zoolander 2” featured a nonbinary character played by Benedict Cumberbatch. His character served one role as a punchline of a sexual joke about genitals where other characters wondered if Cumberbatch’s character had a “hot-dog or a bun.”  
In the entertainment industry, we need to do better than utilize LGBTQ+ characters for just comic relief or bigoted humor. Additionally, the entertainment industry must not continue making LGBTQ+ characters small and minor roles. These characters deserve large parts, just as much as any hetreosexual character, because the LGBTQ+ community is filled with important perspectives and stories aside from its sexuality. 
DC’s new Superman is the blueprint for the rest of the entertainment industry. Instead of an unknown LGBTQ+ character, Jonathan has his own room to grow and explore his sexual identity as a main focus. Instead of being a recycled, heterosexual leftover storyline with a swapped sexuality, Jonathan finds himself in a new narrative.

Senior Nic Porter might be the best goalie in the nation, and he just got his third MPSF Player of the Week award to prove it. With its defensive anchor at the top of his game, No. 3 USC looks to claim victory in its penultimate regular season game against No. 7 UC Santa Barbara on Sunday, Oct. 31.
USC currently stands 14-1 after a four-goal comeback against No. 4 Stanford last week. The Trojans held the Cardinal scoreless in the fourth quarter to emerge victorious, 15-11.
“We actually stepped up … the team actually got their thoughts together, stepped up, and won a game,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It’s a very, very important thing that I’m taking from this game.”
The team defense and Porter have both been terrific in the last two games. The Trojans held the Cardinal two goals under their 13.6 season average and No. 5 Long Beach State 4 goals under theirs, all while Porter has saved 56.5% of shot attempts.
“It’s amazing, Nic is [the] bedrock of our defense,” redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep said. “He always gives us so much security and fuels the emotion behind the defense … This is just all the hard work he put in.”
While Porter is well aware of his stardom, he is quick to downplay his individual achievements.
“This is such a cliché, but it really is the team and the system that we play,” Porter said. “I just try to play my role in the team to the best of my ability … What we stress in our program is it’s team first.”
On the offensive end, redshirt junior driver Ashworth Molthen and senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt have been the Trojans’ driving force, scoring 8 and 7 goals, respectively, in the last three games. Against UC Santa Barbara, and looking into the future, with a matchup with No. 1 UCLA set for next week, USC will need Porter, Molthen and Ehrhardt in peak form, as well as the composure Pintaric raved about.
“It’s gonna be everything,” Pintaric said. “The team with the coolest head will prevail. [I’m trying to put] the team in challenging situations to react to … that’s what we’re actually going to address today in practice, as well.”
Having fresh legs will also help USC. Pintaric has been rotating the team all season, giving substantial playing time to reserves. This freshness helped fuel the comeback victory over Stanford and that it will be important for USC moving forward.
The Trojans host UC Santa Barbara at 1 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center Sunday.

Content warning: This article contains references of sexual assault, drugging and violence. 
The breaking news of sexual assault allegations arising from USC’s  Interfraternity Council chapters drove students to protest and demand accountability at the Row. These instances come as horrifying, even surprising to some students. 
And yet, USC managed to entangle itself in another major controversy, one for which — in all honesty — it did not do enough to prevent. The University’s required consent modules and workshops are laughably shallow and trivializing, and USC must now suffer the consequences for its lack of retrospective action.
The University’s consent and sexual harassment education guides students through roleplaying situations where young adults find themselves in sexually ambiguous situations. Students watch scenario videos and answer “what to do’’ questions. 
While this format aims to engage students, it reduces the severity of sexual assault and consent to a few hours and a couple dozen questions. When the University presents this material to students in a homework-like format, it should not come as a surprise when students treat it that way.
In an interview with VICE, Donna Freitas, a leading researcher on consent and sexual harassment and author of “Consent on Campus: A Manifesto,” describes similar university modules and workshops as, “the result of scarce resources Student Affairs receives in order to tackle a highly complex problem,” and it’s impossible to disagree. 
As upsetting as it is, the 17 reported incidents of sexual assault in the past month may possibly initiate tangible change in the “Trojans Respect Consent” realm. Ironically, this entire sexual assault awareness system was only implemented at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year. Two years later — and after 18 months of the coronavirus pandemic — the system is already failing. 
While it is easy to criticize USC’s lack of commitment to addressing sexual assault, there is not one simple solution. However, it is blatantly obvious that, given the resources that the school possesses, a lot more should be expected. 
One of USC’s biggest problems with its consent curriculum is its lack of discussion about the repercussions of sexual offenses. The curriculum focuses on the do’s and don’t’s of approaching a sexually ambiguous situation: Don’t try to engage with someone who is intoxicated; if they don’t seem interested, don’t push. 
Most students know about these situations before entering their college years, and, while it is extremely important to review these aspects to ensure all students are on the same page about consent and sexual understanding, it is even more important for students to understand the repercussions of their actions if they choose to act in a malicious manner. 
To better understand this gaping hole in the school’s consent education system, students can ask themselves the following questions: California defines sexual assault as any form of unconsenual sexual touching, but what counts as a misdemeanor and what counts as a felony? What penalties can come from a sexual assault misdemeanor? Instead of reading scripts and enacting role plays over Zoom meetings, our consent modules should more intensely instill the retribution that would come from a conviction. 
However, our society severely normalizes sexual assault and most rapists face no retribution, making any type of change disturbingly not feasible. 
So, what can be done to try and change the way students are taught about consent? In studies and research efforts such as Rebecca Ortiz’s “Define Your Line” campaign, college students were taught consent from an approach that directly addressed sexual misunderstandings based on societal gender stereotypes. The study also reached out to groups with lack of racial diversity, such as Greek life organizations, to maintain secure connections with them that emphasized consent education, and the results from the research project demonstrated that these practices may be worth incorporating into more general sexual consent guidance.
Diverging from more stereotypical consent education, the University could more directly emphasize respect among college students. 
Lack of respect is the greatest inhibiting factor between creating a study body that does not engage in sexually inappropriate behavior or fraternities that do not attain national coverage for a date-rape scandal. There have to be forced discussions about non-sexual respect, ones that humanize students and address the severity of what enduring any form of harassment may procure in the long run. 
If, for no other reason, USC should take these drastic measures for the victims of IFC chapters’ assaults. All Trojans must be aware that their actions have consequences. And all Trojans must be aware that every person they interact with is a person who may remember that interaction, no matter how big or small.

When junior running back Keaontay Ingram scored a touchdown to cut the Notre Dame lead to 15 last Saturday, I began to rework my game story lede. 
For some reason, it seemed like USC would make the comeback needed to steal a victory. I thought, “Wow, maybe they can steal it here.” The momentum shifted, the defense started gaining some confidence and the offense began to click. 
Then, in the middle of writing, I laughed and said to myself: “No way they come back,” and proceeded to delete the new lede as I watched the Trojans’ defense unable to get a stop. 
It’s depressing to see how far USC football has fallen since the great Pete Carroll days which — cover your eyes — reached their highest point 13 years ago. Some hang on to those seven glory seasons like a favorite blanket, but it will take some time before USC gets back to that.
Since Carroll left in 2009, the Trojans have won three bowl games — the Las Vegas Bowl, Holiday Bowl and Rose Bowl. They’re also on their way to their second losing record in fourseasons. 
It’s safe to say the Trojans are at an extremely important point in their storied history. If the right coach is not appointed, do your best NSYNC impression and say bye-bye-bye to USC football’s relevancy.
Oregon’s Head Coach Mario Cristobal seems to be building a powerhouse in the Pac-12, stealing recruits from the Trojans’ backyard. The Ducks have five recruits from Southern California in the 2022 class, four of whom are four-stars. 
That can’t happen. Sadly, it’s been happening for too long. And if you were paying attention to recruiting three days before the Notre Dame game, five-star defensive lineman Mykel Williams, decommitted from USC and committed to Georgia. 
It was a loss greater than the one against the Irish, and one that the Trojans are becoming far too comfortable with happening to them. 
It’s why I decided to write this column once USC failed to come back against Notre Dame. 
I don’t need to make you anymore depressed about the Trojans’ state, but here I go — things won’t magically be corrected with the hiring of a new, well-appointed coach. 
Of course, whoever comes in will be a huge boost, gathering excitement around the program again. The mediocrity under Clay Helton will be completely over and a fresh canvas will be readily available for a new coach to scribble and paint its depiction of a successful program. 
But, I know you were waiting for the but, a huge cultural change has to happen before USC is back to competing. The penalties and mistakes are becoming far too common in games — especially when they are nationally televised. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has become as empty as the 101 during the early days of the coronavirus. Loyal fans are far past fed up. 
One person can’t solve the problem. 
They can’t keep an offensive lineman from refraining to move before the ball is snapped. They can’t keep a cornerback or linebacker from swiping at the ankles of a receiver and fail to bring them down. 
What they can do is bring some hope, some life, some juice into a program that’s been in a drought since the 2017 Rose Bowl, which feels like ages ago. 
The first task for whoever gets hired is recruiting — USC can’t be behind schools such as Colorado and Arizona in the 2022 recruiting class. It doesn’t make sense for a homegrown kid like Bryce Young to decommit from USC and attend Alabama. When the Trojans were at their highest, a Mater Dei five-star playing at the Coliseum would have been a no-brainer.
The second is getting rid of the Air Raid offense. I’m not a football offensive guru myself, but it doesn’t take much to realize this doesn’t work. Since its inception at USC in 2019, nothing has happened — just a whole bunch of yards that haven’t resulted in much winning.
It’s time to get back to traditional Trojan football: leaning on a lead running back and running the offense through him. Ingram can possibly be that guy, but, if not, redshirt sophomore Darwin Barlow has the potential to be just that. 
Obviously, these two fixes won’t drastically change what happens for the program, but it is a start, and one that must be considered.
Until then, let’s hope freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart can get some runs and junior wide receiver Drake London can break some records. 
It’ll be our therapy for this season.

When asked if he remembered his first day in the United States, redshirt junior punter Ben Griffiths looked to the right and chuckled. His long, twirly mustache rose up as he spewed the details. 
He said it went like this: After his 14-hour flight from Melbourne, Australia to Los Angeles, he went to his apartment, changed into a new shirt and headed straight to campus. 
Griffiths didn’t wait in line at Dulce or try to catch lunch at Cava. Instead, he went to pick up his USC ID card. 
“I was jet lagged as hell,” Griffiths said. “[I] pretty much dropped my bags off at my apartment, didn’t even have time for a shower. I had to go get my student ID done … That was a tough day.”
Although a long way away from the comfort of his home in Australia,  Griffiths’ first day is a testament to who the punter is — a true professional and an extremely hard worker. 
But, as he traveled to a new country, Griffiths faced a new challenge right: the Australian Football League veteran became a first-time college student at the age of 27. 
It was the start of another chapter in his life, one filled with  booming punts and sitting in a classroom for the first time in 10 years. 
Early life and AFL success
Griffiths’ love for football began during recess. Exposed to Australian football “at a really young age,” Griffiths became serious and joined Auskick, a developmental program in Australia meant for children to get introduced to the sport. 
As he rose up in the program’s ranks, making it as a professional became a reality. At 18, drafted out of high school by the Richmond Tigers, Griffiths became a professional player. 
The college sports culture prominent in the U.S. doesn’t exist in Australia, Griffiths said. Players are picked out of high school to compete and develop over the years. 
“You get recruited from club level and high schools, mainly. Teams, when they draft, you can look at players as more investment,” Griffiths said. “Whereas, I think here you kind of skip that phase because the players between 18 and 21 spend time in college.”
Griffiths became an experienced professional, spending eight seasons with the Tigers before making a decision on his future: He wanted to get a degree to set himself up after retiring from sports permanently. 
Australian football began to take a toll on the 6-foot-7, 240-pound man. Injuries stemming from not being fully developed at a young age gave him shoulder problems. Then, as the years went on and injuries persisted, he had a few concussions. 
It left him with a choice. 
“It put a lot of things in perspective for me. One of them being like, ‘What was I going to do post-football?’” Griffiths said. “Sport is always such a small part of your life. There’s so much lots of life after that.”
It was then where the idea of going to college appealed to Griffiths. Nearing his 30s, he quickly realized sports wouldn’t last forever and transitioned to getting a degree. He retired from the game at 26 and moved on to another football. 
USC and learning how to punt
During the first couple of months in the U.S., Griffiths found himself in a precarious situation. At 28-years-old, being a student was taking some time to come back. 
”It took me a while to kind of adjust sitting in a classroom again,” Griffiths said. “I found myself getting really fatigued, just from concentrating for so long at a chalkboard.”
As the semester went on, assignments began popping up. No longer  only focusing on football, Griffiths had to start setting time aside for school.
He began to worry, not about a roommate or balancing time between school and football, but about turning in his paper for WRIT150 during his freshman year. 
He hadn’t fully adjusted to life in the U.S., let alone remembered how to write a structured paper. 
“It was a rude awakening when I handed in my first paper and got the first grade,” Griffiths said. 
But school was the most difficult of a transition. On the field, Griffiths felt in his comfort zone, backed by strong training.
Once he retired from Australian football, Griffiths learned to punt properly at the academy ProKick Australia, which was built to make the transition from Australian football to college or NFL easier. It was a three-days-a-week camp full of training to make Griffiths comfortable in his move. 
Even though kicking the ball is prominent in Australian football and gave him some experience, punting was practically a new skill for him. From his time over at the AFL, Griffiths built up bad habits, making learning how to punt more difficult. 
Helping him tremendously with training, the program also matched him directly with USC. No other schools were considered and no other schools would have changed his mind — he was set on becoming a Trojan. 
“Once I heard USC was sniffing around, I was pretty keen to kind of lock it down. Given that it’s such a great school. It’s such a storied history and really wanted to be a part of that,” Griffiths said. “But also the fact that, logistically wise, a direct flight in and out of Melbourne.”
His first season at USC, he averaged a whopping 41.2 yards on 52 punts — enough to be voted in the 2019 AP All-Pac-12 second team. 
He followed it up his sophomore year with an average of 46.4 yards a punt — the highest average by a Trojan since 2003 — and appearances on the AP and Pro Football Focus first-team. 
Standing at nearly 6-foot-8, punters are rarely Griffiths’ height. Despite the untypical size for a punter, Special Teams Coordinator Sean Snyder saw Griffiths’ unique talent the moment he was hired in 2020. 
“At the end of the day, I find it hard to find too many better [than him],” Snyder said.
“He’s a great role model” and the NFL
Something else stood out to make Griffiths a top contender for the position outside of his kicking: his leadership and work ethic. Players noticed it during workouts and off the field and named him captain for the 2021 season, the first special teams player to serve in the position  since 1998. 
Griffiths was shocked about the news.
“I was really blown away,” he said. “I wasn’t expecting it. ​​I’ve been doing the same thing for the last three years. I hold myself to a high standard. And I guess they saw that.”
Others too clearly saw it. 
John Smith, who worked directly with Griffiths at ProKick Australia for a year, saw a lot of this leadership in Griffiths. Smith said the unique work ethic and consistency Griffiths brought each and every day. 
“Nobody worked harder than Griffiths. Nobody,” Smith said. “He was there all the time. He never dropped anything. He never had any leverage of his status as a professional athlete. He came in and he did everything that everybody else needed to do.”
What stood out to Smith more, though, was Griffiths’ leadership, calling his ability “immense” and his conduct “exemplary.” 
When Snyder arrived the summer between Griffiths’ first and second year at USC, the Aussie exploded. His 46.4 yard-average on each punt made him the sixth-best punter in the nation. 
Snyder witnessed firsthand Griffiths’ meticulous work ethic to improve his skills.
“His attention to detail at what he was doing and as he’s done that, he just gets better and better and better,” Snyder said. “I mean for him, I think, sky’s the limit.”
Griffiths served as a leader in the locker room, too, playing the role of the older 30-year-old brother to his younger 18-year-old teammates. 
“He’s a great role model. Great leader,” freshman safety Jaylin Smith said. “Awesome person to have in the locker room. Good personality. He’s just [an] all-around great guy.”
Leadership is just a part of who Griffiths is. However, he has bigger aspirations. 
With two more years of eligibility and his years of experience, Griffiths sets his sight to the next level — playing in the NFL. 
The move to the U.S. began with the idea of playing professionally and, as Snyder put it, “He’s gonna have a long future.” 
But for Griffiths, there is something more important: his ultimate reason for his decision to make a career change from being an Australian football professional to one in the U.S.
Like everything else in his life, Griffiths approached the NFL process with reason and that same caution that made him a top-punter in the country. 
“First and foremost, for me, it was to get a degree,” Griffiths said. “The degree is what’s going to take you further. Sport can set you up, but you’re not going to play for the rest of your life as much as I want.”

This season has been lackluster for USC, to say the least. After ending last season with a disappointing loss in the Pac-12 championship against Oregon at home, fans looked for the team to rebound with a more experienced squad. 
Even on a national level, experts thought the Trojans were a dark horse to make a run into the College Football Playoff and named junior quarterback Kedon Slovis as a potential Heisman finalist at the start of the season, according to popular oddsmakers like SportsLine. 
However, right now the team holds wins for three of its seven games, with a 2-3 record in Pac-12 play. The Trojans got as high as No. 14 in the country before losses began to pile up. 
Many of these games should have been competitive matchups, and even in USC’s favor, but they ended up as disappointing blowouts. With high-caliber players like junior wide receiver Drake London and top recruit freshman defensive lineman Korey Foreman, the program is not currently playing at its expected level. 
Still, not all hope is lost for USC. There are some potential positives to take away if the team can find its rhythm again in these upcoming games. Here are the top five things fans can look forward to in the remainder of the season.
5. Winning against a Pac-12 school in front of fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
The only game the Trojans won at home was the season opener against San Jose State. Since then, USC suffered three straight defeats at home against Stanford, Oregon State and Utah. 
In each of these games, the Trojan defense allowed 40+ points, which made it hard for the offense to keep up. If USC can analyze what went wrong in these games and implement the necessary changes in Saturday’s game against Arizona, the Trojans can finally win a home game after almost a near two-month drought. 
The Wildcats have not won a game this season with an 0-7 record, so USC has all the momentum.
4. Reaching, playing in and winning a Bowl Game
It’s been almost two years since USC has played in a bowl game, and even in that Holiday Bowl game in December 2019 the Trojans got blown out by a score of 49-24 by a strong Iowa squad. 
If the Trojans can rack up three more wins to become bowl-eligible, it would be a chance for fans to see the team get some type of honor after this tumultuous season. It won’t be the easiest task though: USC would have to win three of its last five games to gain bowl eligibility. 
3. The head coach search
One of the main talking points in the head coaching carousel is “Who is going to take the USC job?” Just this week, former Trojans quarterback Carson Palmer said Pittsburgh Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin was a potential name to look out for. Although these claims were quickly struck down by Tomlin himself, there are still other famous college coaches like Penn State’s James Franklin that are in the mix, and it shows that this head coaching position is getting a lot of attention by coaches who have succeeded at the highest level. Regardless, fans can still anticipate which new hire can lead the team back to its glory.
2. Drake London 
Junior wide receiver Drake London has been the main standout of the season and is one of the best players at his position at the college level. He currently has 79 catches, 5 touchdowns and 1,003 yards only seven games into the season. 
London is vying for a potential first-round selection in the NFL Draft. So fans can look forward to watching him play for the remainder of the season, but they can also look forward to future games he’ll likely play as an NFL player.
1. UCLA game
No matter how the season is going, USC fans will almost always enjoy the opportunity to beat their rivals. After last season’s thriller against UCLA, where USC won 43-38 at the Rose Bowl with a touchdown in the final minute of the game, it is unlikely that this year’s edition will be any less exciting. 
UCLA, with its somewhat successful season at 5-3, will try to win the division and reach the Pac-12 championship. Adding another loss to UCLA’s record and foiling its conference championship aspirations will be great for the Trojans to continue to keep its dominance in Los Angeles collegiate sports.

In its second half of the season, the 3-4 Trojans head coaching search heating up. Although, USC may be out of Pac-12 Championship contention and as its bowl hopes dwindle with each loss, the drama surrounding the program and its next head coach continues. 
This past week, former USC quarterback Carson Palmer went on the Dan Patrick Show and resparked the conversation by mentioning Pittsburgh Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin. 
Just a day later, Brett McMurphy of Action Network reported former Rams Head Coach Jeff Fisher is also a viable candidate. Let’s look at some of the big names and where they stand midway through the college football season. 
Mike Tomlin 
The Carson Palmer and Tomlin saga is not as big of a deal as people make it. It’s a consensus that an NFL coach in one of the best jobs in the league would be crazy to leave. Tomlin made that clear in his press conference this week saying, “That’s a joke to me. I have one of the best jobs in all of professional sport. Why would I have any interest in coaching college football?” Palmer’s comment seems more like a way for USC to show other coaches who are legitimate options that the Trojans have bigger and better names on the table. This may make the job seem more intriguing for those candidates. Tomlin seems to have removed himself from the running for the job.
Jeff Fisher 
Like Tomlin, this report seems just out of touch. Jeff Fisher was shown on Monday Night Football just a couple weeks ago fishing in Tennessee. The USC graduate was interviewed on CBS Sports Radio by Zach Gleb this week and when asked about the job gave an unenthusiastic “We just have to see what happens.” Jeff Fisher is also not in the running for the job. 
James Franklin 
Penn State’s recent woes seem to have cooled James Franklin’s name after he was a popular pick the beginning of the search. This past weekend the Nittany Lions lost a nine overtime thriller against 2-5 Illinois. A loss where Penn St. had many opportunities to win might have brought back flashbacks for Athletic Director Mike Bohn and his hiring staff. 
The former No. 4 team in the country has lost two games in a row, dropped to No. 20 and will play No. 5 Ohio State this weekend. Franklin’s 2-11 record against top 10 teams continues to be a conversation, and it’s most likely going to take another hit. 
Franklin has turned from a home run to a controversial pick in just 2 weeks. 
Matt Campbell 
Campbell continues to do what is expected as Iowa State  comes off its upset win over No. 15 Oklahoma State this past weekend. With a 40-30 record with the Cyclones despite very little resources, Campbell has made himself an intriguing candidate for a USC team with all the resources a coach can dream of and with an athletic director whose shown he’s committed to investing in the program. 
Campbell continues as a strong pick for the job. 
Luke Fickell
Fickell has taken his Cincinnati team from a 4-8 season to begin his tenure in 2017 to a No. 2 ranking this year. The Bearcats’ only ranked opponent left on their schedule is No. 19 SMU, and it seems like a College Football Playoff bid is one for Cincinnati to lose this season. 
Bohn, who hired Fickell at Cincinnati, will have to do some major convincing to get the Midwesterner to come to Los Angeles, but he seems like the strongest candidate for the job. Associate Athletic Director Brandon Sosna also played a role in hiring Fickell at Cincinnati. 
Fickell is currently the strongest candidate for the job. 
Tony Elliott 
A hot name before the season started, Clemson’s Offensive Coordinator does not seem like a legitimate candidate for the job any longer due to the Tigers’ underperformance this season. The Clemson offense is currently ranked No.114 out of 130 FBS teams. 
Jeff Hafley 
A under-the-radar potential candidate, Hafley was a rising star coming into this season and continues to impress at Boston College. Hafley holds a wealth of experience at the collegiate level as an assistant coach with Ohio State, Rutgers and Pitt along with NFL experience with the 49ers, Buccaneers and Browns. 
Boston started 4-0 with injury issues at quarterback but since then, has struggled and lost its last three games to Clemson, NC State and Louisville. The latter two were by large margins. 
Hafley has good experience but would be a surprising pick for the job.

USC will look to snap its two-game losing streak Saturday as it faces Arizona at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for homecoming weekend. 
It’s been an up-and-down season for the Trojans who have an overall record of 3-4 and a Pac-12 record of 2-3. USC suffered a tough 31-16 loss away at Notre Dame last weekend, one of its oldest and most significant rivals. 
Despite these losses, interim Head Coach Donte Williams still feels confident about the team and the rest of the season. 
“It’s been a lot of adjustments as far as schematically and a lot more things off the field,” said Williams Tuesday after practice. “It’s been a ton of adjustments actually … We actually have the structure and the foundation in place that I would like now and make sure that we go ahead and just get the results we want on Saturday.” 
USC currently leads the Pac-12 with 2,209 passing yards averaging 444.7 yards per game. Arizona gives up an average of 362.3 yards per game. 
This game has significance for Williams, who was the cornerbacks coach at Arizona in 2016. 
Arizona has been struggling this season as well, losing all of its seven games and playing in the midst of a 19-game losing streak dating back to the 2019 season. Both teams remain unranked. 
The Pac-12 South rivals have faced off since 1916.  USC holds an overall record of 35-8 against the Wildcats. 
In 2020, USC earned a narrow 34-30 away victory in Arizona. The game was extremely close with the two teams tied 20-20 going into the fourth quarter. 
One of the highlights for USC this season has been the run game. Senior transfer running back Keaontay Ingram has been a standout on the USC offense with an average of 103 rushing yards per game over the last four games. He is ranked fourth in the Pac-12 for rushing. 
“I feel like right now, as a team, 1-0, that’s the only thing we can do, that’s the only thing that we can control at the end of the day,” said Ingram after Tuesday practice. “The best mentality is to live in the moment.”  
There have been many questions surrounding the USC quarterbacks after freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart had a record-breaking debut against Washington State, throwing four touchdowns with a 65.2% completion rate. Dart was later injured in this game and soon after underwent meniscus surgery. 
Dart was “cleared to an extent” for the Notre Dame game, Williams said, but the head coach decided to hold him out. Williams called for an open quarterback competition after the Washington State game. 
Offensive Coordinator Graham Harrell had high praise for both Dart and freshman quarterback Miller Moss.
