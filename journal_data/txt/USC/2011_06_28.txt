In a televised speech to the nation, President Barack Obama announced last week that he will slowly begin to remove American troops from Afghanistan. Ten thousand troops will come home by the end of the year, and 33,000 will be home by summer 2012.
“By 2014, this process of transition will be complete,” Obama said in regard to handing responsibility for security to the Afghan government.

As is typical with Obama, this nice gesture fails to enact the change needed immediately. The decade-long war in Afghanistan needs to come to a complete close not years from now, but immediately.
When the United States first went to war in Afghanistan in 2001, the stated goal of the mission was to dismantle Al Qaeda. We have thoroughly weakened Al Qaeda with the deaths of more than half of the group’s identified leadership; with the death of Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda lost the only true leader it has ever known. Even before the death of Bin Laden, CIA Director Leon Panetta stated there were likely less than 50 members of Al Qaeda still in the country. Meanwhile, we had nearly 100,000 troops there.
We were brought into Afghanistan under the pretense that it was a war of self-defense. But that excuse for war has long since ceased to be valid. For the last few years, our military has been engaging in nation building, not fighting terrorism. We have invested billions of dollars in civil infrastructure into another country at a time when our own country desperately needs money for schools, roads, and infrastructure.
Since the beginning of 2001, we have spent more than $400 billion in Afghanistan. At a time when Republicans are proposing cutting home-heating oil for the poor and gutting Medicare to trim the deficit, it is ludicrous to be spending billions of dollars a month on a war that is not absolutely necessary.
And we must make no mistake: The war in Afghanistan is not absolutely necessary. We have long since defeated our enemies there, and it is time to focus on rebuilding our own country instead of countries overseas. The Taliban we are still fighting in Afghanistan are ruthless. If the United States leaves, the results might be disastrous for the people of Afghanistan. Yet America simply cannot afford to police the entire world, at least not right now. There are many organizations such as the United Nations or the Arab League that are more adequately equipped to rebuild Afghanistan than the United States military.
Democracy in the Middle East is a nice objective, but it has never been the stated goal of the United States military. As we have seen in the recent “Arab Spring,” Arabic countries are fully capable of initiating political change without our help.
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have practically bankrupted our country and contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Remaining in Afghanistan any longer would be the biggest gift to those who wish to do America harm. As long as we maintain a significant presence in the Middle East, we are defeating ourselves.
Not to be ignored is the human cost of the war. Over 1,500 young Americans have lost their lives in Afghanistan. We owe it to our military to never put our soldiers’ lives in danger unless we absolutely must. And once again, the war in Afghanistan is not a war of necessity at this point. Almost 30 percent of those who have lost their lives in Afghanistan were between 18 to 21 years old. In different circumstances, they might have been in college living a carefree existence like most of us reading this. Too many young men and women have lost their lives to, in good conscience, continue this war.
While it is refreshing to know the war in Afghanistan at least has an end in sight, the end will not come soon enough for American troops fighting overseas and for American taxpayers footing the bill for the war.

Nobody pays attention to history.  The war in Afghanistan was the icing on the cake that bankrupted the USSR and a trillion dollars later, the USA is headed down the same path.  Have the wars in Iraq & Afghanistan achieved stability or peace in the Middle East, lower oil prices, or an end to terrorism?  We do know the wars brought premature death to thousands of men and women in the armed forces and tens of thousands of innocent “collateral damage.”  We do know there are tens of thousands of mentally and physically handicapped veterans who are back home and require extensive and expensive treatment that is not readily accessible.  So what exactly is our return on investment?  Has anything good come from these wars?  I hope your generation of young people will put an end to the war mentality assuming America will have enough money to dismantle the war machine.

The 17-and-under world can breathe a sigh of relief and run back to their piggy banks: As of Monday, the Supreme Court has reasoned that a 2005 law attempting to deny minors the sale of violent video games is unconstitutional.
Despite the reasoning behind the law — that such games promoted “violent antisocial or aggressive behavior”  — the law was ultimately seen as too controlling and in violation of the First Amendment.
As Justice Antonin Scalia so baldly put it, “Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones.”
Parents of underage students heading off to college, unclench yourselves — this actually bodes well for those new to USC. The Supreme Court’s decision to keep our rated-M pastimes off the proverbial high shelves ensures those lingering minors in the class of 2015 will be adequately prepared to leave the nest and fly into the “University of South Central’s” waiting arms.
To prove such a point, let us investigate that bastion of basement-dwelling clichés: Grand Theft Auto. Incoming freshmen, your first college study guide:
There exists at ’SC an unspoken rite of passage more heart-stopping than the fountain run and more aggravating than Writing 140. If it doesn’t happen to you, it will inevitably happen to someone you know. It’s not the first time your RA writes you up and it is not your first Thursday on The Row. It’s having your bike (or pieces of it) stolen.
In this situation, a teenager who had spent more time playing softball and less time blowing up gas stations with a rocket launcher might be stunned at the site of a mangled axle and one lone, sadly spinning wheel where their beloved blue beach cruiser used to be. Those who grew up on Grand Theft Auto, however, are familiar enough with such carnage to shoulder the scrap parts, assess the most efficient route back to their dorm, cache the remains under their bed and head off to Spanish II without so much as batting an eye.
And the GTA wisdom doesn’t end there. What many parents, or those in the minority of the 7-2 Supreme Court vote that scrapped the ban, might not realize is that Grand Theft Auto doesn’t just prepare you for the real world. It teaches morals. Each time you end up in the hospital or get caught by the police, you’re fined hundreds of dollars to discourage you from letting it happen again. Much like in real life. Video game-savvy freshman tasting independence for the first time will be less tempted to engage in activities likely to land them in either the ER or jail. After all, they’ve been conditioned through their favorite hobby to fear the consequences.
Lastly, fitness. USC is within walking distance of a daunting number of fast-food chains and greasy late-night taco stands. Though no one really goes into Yoshinoya except to use the bathrooms, Chano’s, Jack in the Box, McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Del Taco and Carl’s Jr. form a cardio-defying arsenal of trans fats and carbs that would make any healthy cholesterol level spike on sight merely from panic. Grand Theft Auto-lovers, however, have already been trained to keep trim; in the GTA Los Angeles setting, you learn to manage your characters’ diet and exercise.
So incoming students, if you happen to find yourself on the sharp end of any of ’SC’s less-savory features, don’t fret. Simply allow your Grand Theft Auto-honed reflexes take over.
Study up.

After last year’s Toy Story 3 was critically acclaimed, loved by fans and the first animated film to make over a billion dollars, it would have been a great feat for Pixar to outdo itself this year. With Cars 2, however, it seems like the film studio didn’t even try.

At first, the thought of Pixar making a sequel for Cars is perplexing. Cars has been called the studio’s worst film to date, although it’s still a slightly above-average film in general. It becomes clear Cars 2 wasn’t made to outshine the first; it was made to sell toys and cereal. After all, what’s easier to franchise than cars?
The style is colorful, sleek and targeted directly at kids. But that’s not to say it isn’t worth seeing. It doesn’t make the same mistake made in Cars, which tried to be deep and meaningful through telling the stale story of the fast-minded, self-absorbed jerk who is changed by the down-to-earth, small-town folks with hearts of gold.
Cars 2 doesn’t attempt to be deep and instead embraces its superficiality, which perhaps makes it better than its predecessor. Being the rare Pixar movie that actually feels cartoonish, it’s full of bright colors, multiple scene changes around the world, gadgets, action scenes and, of course, racing. In terms of plot and story, it’s essentially an animated spy film with the thin, underlying message of “be yourself.”
This time around, the protagonist is rusty tow truck Mater, who is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. Mater is definitely a more likeable protagonist than Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) was in Cars, even though it’s hard to determine which one has the more annoying voice. It’s nice to see McQueen get comfortable in the backseat while Mater has his own adventure when he is mistaken to be the American contact by two British spy cars.
Mater might not be a spy movie archetype, but he does play the familiar well-meaning, bumbling hero. He’s a bit of an idiot, which gets annoying from time to time, but he’s lovable. Like all of the other characters, there’s nothing much to say about him; the characters are all one-dimensional and serve their purposes to move the story along.
That’s not to say they aren’t enjoyable. One of the most fun aspects of Cars is the voice actors. Michael Caine voices Finn McMissile, one of the British spies. Famed English comedian and actor Eddie Izzard voices Miles Axlerod, a former oil tycoon who is promoting his renewable fuel Allinol in the first World Grand Prix. John Turturro is nothing but entertaining as F1 car Francesco Bernouille, an Italian racecar who becomes McQueen’s racing rival and spouts arrogant and hilarious dialogue. Lastly, there’s Bruce Campbell, the famed B-movie star, who voices the actual American spy car.
In keeping with the spirit of spy films, Cars 2 has a number of recognizable archetypes such as the suave, old-school spy, the newbie and the evil German scientist.
The villains are a group of evil, vindictive lemons who feel as if they’ve been slighted by the world — and they have. The mastermind leading their cause, however, is revealed near the end in a surprising twist.
While Cars 2 is sleek, easy-going and fun, there’s one aspect that really hits home how little this film resonates with viewers. It’s death. Death is one of the many concepts that runs through Pixar’s veins. The presence of death is significant in its other films like Ratatouille, A Bug’s Life and Toy Story 3 as a way to let audience members know the consequences for the characters if things go wrong, but death fails to get a grip in Cars 2. A number of the characters die, but their deaths aren’t important. They do not register as real deaths because the characters are anthropomorphic vehicles. This is just another sign that Pixar made a bad decision for making not just one, but two films focusing on cars. There’s simply nothing heartwarming or human enough about them.
Cars 2 is a fun, barely above-average film. Older viewers can enjoy it once or twice, but it certainly won’t draw an older crowd like Toy Story 3 did. It’s all about the visuals, not the story, which is why it fails as a Pixar movie but still has a chance at the box office.
If anything, Cars 2 is worth seeing just for the hilarious Toy Story short that plays beforehand; not only is it good to those characters again, but it’s almost as if the short reminds viewers that Pixar still has the chops before they dive into the mediocre splash that is Cars 2.
I’m a little scared to take the kids to this one with all the violence…
This seemed like a very biased written article. You even mentioned the ‘annoying’ voices of Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy. It’s all a matter of opinion I suppose, but I think the voices fit well with the characters. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Less of a story than its predecessor, but overall, I think the film was above adequate, exceeded my expectations, and above all, will be a success in the end. Next time bring forth two perceptions in your article rather than just your own.
“but I think the voices fit well with the characters.”
It looks like everyone has a different opinion, including you.
“Next time bring forth two perceptions in your article rather than just your own.”
Yeah, which one? Yours?
My friends, sister, and I enjoyed it. =)
This was a great movie
No it wasn’t

Transformers: Dark of the Moon opens with a space battle worthy of Star Wars that introduces legendary Autobot warrior Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), who crashlands on the Earth’s moon in the midst of the 1960s space race between America and Russia, before promptly jumping to the present to find the Autobots working with mankind to eliminate terrorists and what few Decepticons remain.
Where a film could go from there is a question only blockbuster producer Michael Bay could answer.

Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is leading a dull, unemployed existence in Washington, D.C. His hot new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is a consolation, sure, but now that he can no longer hang out with Optimus (Peter Cullen), Bumblebee and the other Autobots, he feels like he doesn’t have a purpose in life.
Needless to say, Sam and the Autobots eventually come together to unravel the secret of the dark side of the moon. Massive battles and destruction on an epic scale ensues, as the fate of Earth hangs in the balance.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon had a lot riding on its shoulders. After a promising start in 2007 and an awful sequel in 2009, the franchise needed to compel audiences to take it seriously. Fortunately, its third entry is not just easily its best but also hands down the best live-action 3D film after Avatar.
Bay has always been a master of action filmmaking, but his propensity for rapid-fire editing rendered the action sequences of the first two films virtually incomprehensible and unwatchable. Now, however, all the battles consist of much longer shots, a consequence of the new 3D cameras forcing Bay to have less cuts. The results are mind-blowing — every action scene is fluid, energetic and easy on the eyes.
Whether it’s the sight of Optimus Prime battling a giant worm-like Decepticon or a bunch of American soldiers flying in formation as huge warships fire around them, the visual effects are spectacular and every single element is there in vivid detail. The film has also thankfully jettisoned much (though not all) of the low-brow sitcom aspects that consistently irritated during the previous installments. The gruesome twosome of Mudflap and Skids is completely nonexistent here and Sam’s obnoxious parents barely arrive for a cameo. Admittedly, Sam’s cartoonish co-worker later almost manages to fulfill their camp humor contribution. Once he’s gone, the picture settles on a notably darker and more serious tone, with some characters actually dying. Bay doesn’t pull punches as much as he used to.

It also helps the film still has a pretty good cast. LaBeouf is still the grounding force in this movie and he sells even the weakest dialogue, while series newcomers Frances McDormand and John Malkovich as an uptight NSA Agent and Sam’s over-the-top and hilarious new boss both manage to charm in their limited screen time. Whiteley is a fine substitute for the conspicuously absent Megan Fox, whose Mikaela apparently dumped Sam between films for reasons the film never delves into.
The picture still has all the flaws that plagued its predecessors — one-dimensional, unsubtle characterization, an overabundance of unnecessary subplots that bog down pacing and gaping plot holes.
Yet Dark of the Moon renders all these shortcomings negligible with its sheer technical professionalism. The film’s third act, in which the Decepticons ravage Chicago, is one of the longest, most relentless, tense and exciting set-pieces to ever make it to celluloid. It is pure visual spectacle on a grandiose scale that is worth the price of admission alone.
One critic at the film’s world premiere at the Moscow International Film Festival compared watching it to getting a massage.
It’s hard to disagree.

Three years after she dropped her last album, Beyonce Knowles is back to run the music world. But her ammunition isn’t quite as strong this time.
Run the world · World-wide pop star Beyoncé draws on three years of experience as a consumer of music in making her fourth studio album. - Photo courtesy of Columbia Records 
Beyoncé’s fiery return to mainstream pop music this year has been hard to ignore. From her performance during Oprah’s farewell blowout to her American Idol finale showstoppers, the Houston native seems quite opposed to the art of subtlety. Instead, she’s everywhere, speaking and singing yet again for all the single ladies, girls, Sasha Fierces and what-have-yous who are crazy in love, dangerously in love or still trying to get over a man who did them wrong.
Her fourth solo album, 4 (very clever, Mrs. Jay-Z), does little to back up her run-the-world mentality though. None of the songs seem capable of taking off as well as her 2008 track “Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It),” a song that arguably defines Beyoncé’s career.
In discussing what went into the making of this album, the superstar has repeatedly said she took a break from the spotlight and made herself an audience member, attending numerous concerts and performances, all the while discovering new sounds and elements to add to her own music. In a way, this is Beyoncé trying to redefine her sound.
But the result is a mix of too many sounds that seem to boil down to a mellow type of R&B album that sounds like a product of the 1990s scene, when groups like En Vogue and Boys II Men were at their peak. On tracks like “I Miss You” and “Love On Top,” Beyoncé is singing to high-’90s heaven, with smooth, seductive jazz beats to back her up.
To accompany her R&B devotion, she rasps, screeches and screams through a handful of ballads, especially “1+1” — one of the two songs she performed on Idol. The song was set to be released as the second single off the album, but “Best Thing I Never Had” was chosen instead, and reasonably so.
Beyoncé treads the line between “good” and “bad” singing with songs like “1+1.” She sings, If I ain’t got something I don’t give a damn / ’Cause I’ve got it with you. The line starts out beautifully melodic, but when she gets to you, someone is apparently pulling her hair to get her to sing at an awkwardly high pitch. The song is difficult to sit through, and its lack of a chorus will not make it work if she releases it as a single. The screeches also provoke the question, “Why is Beyoncé so angry?”
But among these mediocre recordings lies the track “Party,” featuring the elusive André 3000 of Outkast, and a short talk-rap intro and outro from Kanye West. The track was leaked early (along with the entire album), and “Party” was a highly anticipated ordeal.
Too bad the party is lame.
The tempo is too slow for the names behind the song, and what could have been the summer song to end all songs turns into another forgettable ode to how much Beyoncé loves some guy. Yes, Jay-Z, she’s looking at you.
The best attempt to convey the supposed array of influences she used to make the album comes with the songs “Countdown” and “Run the World (Girls).” On “Countdown” she uses jazz sounds reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s, infused with reggae, hip-hop and soul. It’s something uplifting and fun, but buried way too late in the tracklisting.
“Run the World (Girls)” makes sense as the first song off the album. The African drum beats and haughty attitude are familiarly Beyoncé-esque.
The best song on the album, and the second single, is “Best Thing I Never Had.” She sings that she’s through with you and it sucks to be you right now, refreshing and real words from a lady who dresses up many of her song lyrics far too often. When she’s at this type of genuine point in her art, Beyoncé is most vulnerable and enjoyable.
In total, Beyoncé offers 12 new tracks, but the singer reportedly recorded 72 songs between 2008 and 2011 and submitted them all to her record company, Columbia Records. To think that these were the best bunch out of 72 is quite a letdown. Still, she’ll be running the world for years to come, even with subpar music to back her up.

What do you get when you mix two eschatology-obsessed eccentrics with flamethrowers, a muscle car named Medusa and a girl named Milly?
Thematically, the result is a haywire phantasmagoria representing the misogyny of the male ego, decadence and abandonment.
In practice, the result is Bellflower, an official selection at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival that has blown up recently thanks to the hard work of the film’s writer, director and star Evan Glodell and his production crew, Coatwolf Studios.

Bellflower’s story centers on the relationship between Woodrow (Evan Glodell) and his mordant girlfriend Milly (Jessie Wiseman).  It is Woodrow and Milly’s seditious relationship that powers the film through bizarre twists and turns that keep audiences guessing and questioning the whole ride.
Glodell brought his film, cast and crew to the School of Cinematic Arts’ Ray Stark Family Theatre for a special screening and Q&A session Monday nigh to shed some light on his thought-provoking film.
“I was going through an extremely rough end to a relationship,” Glodell said when asked about the inspiration for his narrative.
Palpable emotions flow vividly throughout the film, enabling Bellflower to strike a chord of realism with its audience.
Bellflower, however, is more than a love story.  The film toys with comedic, dramatic and romantic undertones, making Bellflower a bipolar concoction of realism in the tradition of  cult hit novelist Chuck Palahniuk.
The film is equal parts heartbreak, anger and disappointment — all strong emotions — so why the seemingly nondescript title, Bellflower?
“It’s just a title,” Glodell said.  “I was walking around an old neighborhood I used to live in, and I came across a street called Bellflower. … ‘Bell’ reminded me of a chime, and ‘flower’ made me think of growth.  To me, [the title] means it’s time to grow, which I think you can say about the characters in any story.”
But make no mistake: Bellflower is no run-of-the-mill coming-of-age story.  The omnipresence of alcohol, drugs, casual sex and violence in the film hardly signify growth, but these vices aren’t simply glossed over: They function as specific calls to either grow up or risk being left behind in the decadence of their pathetic lives.
One of the most stunning and eye-catching aspects of Bellflower is its cinematography.
“Most of the movie was shot on homemade cameras,” Glodell said.  “And roughly 90 percent of the effects were in-camera.”

The film is jam-packed with aesthetically pleasing experimental shots, including scenes where dirt is visible on the lens of the camera — adding grit, both literally and figuratively, to those particular scenes — as well as scenes where it is evident the camera is attempting to mimic Glodell’s various states of mind, as seen during drunken stumbles and awkward brawls.
Not only did Glodell and his crew work on the cameras, but they also built the weapons and cars seen in the movie, and acted out a majority of the stunt scenes themselves.
“We wanted to make the film as real as we could,” Glodell said.  “For a lot of the flamethrower scenes we would just shoot them and hope nothing bad happened.”
How does a crew of indie filmmakers pull off such reckless feats? When asked about the police’s involvement and interference with the film, Dawson said, “To be honest, the cops came all the time, but they were always really chill.”
With such an alarming amount of explosions, gunshots and flame-throwing-action, it is hard to believe Glodell and his crew weren’t once arrested, but that alone speaks to the cavalier attitude that makes this film such an audacious thrill to watch.  It is hard to avoid hooting and clapping during the film’s numerous pyromaniacal shots.
Arguably the most amazing aspect of Bellflower is its ability to deliver such a powerful story with so low a budget.
“There was never any money,” said Vincent Grashaw, who plays the character Mike in the film.  “We shot the film on a budget of roughly $15,000.”
Granted, there are very few special effects in the film, but the ones viewers will see, like massive explosions and a particularly gruesome headshot, are all homespun, thanks to the inventive technical genius of Glodell and Coatwolf’s production crew.
Bellflower is a nonpareil summer film, guaranteed to produce laughs, gasps or applause, if not all three.  But regardless of what you actually do by the end of the film’s combustive 106 minutes, one thing is for sure: You will not forget Bellflower.

The IRS earlier this month revoked the tax-exempt status of 275,000 non-profit organizations, including several affiliated with USC, that failed to file required paperwork.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that non-profit organizations, which are those that don’t distribute earned money to directors or investors, file an annual report with the IRS to remain tax-exempt. Under the law, organizations that don’t file for three consecutive years lose their tax-exempt status, and 2007 was the first year filing was required.
Organizations on the IRS’ automatic revocation list must re-apply for tax-exempt status or they will be required to file a federal tax return and to pay federal income taxes. Additionally, any donations given to organizations that do not regain tax-exempt status will not be tax-deductible for the donors. Donations made before the IRS posted its revocation list are still tax-deductible.
The IRS believes most of the 275,000 organizations on its list are defunct, but this is not the case for all the USC groups listed.
David Walsh, a professor of psychology and an adviser for Psi Chi, a psychology honors society, said he believes the group’s tax-exempt status was revoked because of confusion on the part of the IRS.
“The central office of Psi Chi files the tax exempt status reports for local chapters, and the IRS often fails to cross coordinate those filings,” Walsh said in an email. “I am looking into the matter, but suspect the present notice is an IRS computer operating without supervision.”
Other groups say their inclusion on the list was not an error and isn’t a problem.
For example, the earth sciences honor society Sigma Gamma Epsilon appears on the IRS’ auto-revocation list, but Josh West, an assistant professor of earth sciences and an adviser for the group, said because Sig Gam doesn’t generate revenue, its tax status is largely irrelevant.
“I am not sure the organization was really taking advantage of its tax-exempt status in the first place, so I don’t see the new IRS rules really having much effect in the case of this society,” West said in an email.
Most student organizations don’t file for non-profit status, according to Heather Larabee, USC’s assistant dean of students and director of campus affairs. Larabee added that the decision is left up to the individual groups.
“It is not that common at all. Many look into the process, but very few follow through with the paperwork,” Larabee said in an email.
The groups that do pursue tax-exempt status as non-profits often do so because they want to be able to collect donations or because they are part of a larger national organization, as is the case for Psi Chi and several other fraternities and sororities that file as non-profits.
Several other USC-affiliated organizations ended up on the IRS’ list: the Intersorority Parents Council, SC Paw, the Staff Retirement Association, dental honors society Omicron Kappa Upsilon and medical honors society Alpha Omega Alpha. SC Paw appears to be defunct; the Staff Retirement Association is in the process of filing for reinstatement as a non-profit, according to Janette Brown, the executive director of USC’s Emeriti Center. Representatives from the other groups were unavailable for comment.
For groups looking to regain their non-profit status, the IRS is planning to update its revocation list monthly. Organizations that earn less than $50,000 annually can also apply for transitional relief, which decreases the cost of re-applying for tax-exempt status.
If you know any nonprofits that have been revoked or struggling we are doing a series of workshops throughout the region to help them. The first is at the House of Blues in Hollywood on July 22.

In a collaboration spanning more than 3,000 miles and 40 courses of instruction, The New York Times and USC announced a joint venture Tuesday that will offer extensive continuing education programs sponsored by the two institutions.
Collaboration · The Office of Continuing Education, located at the Davidson Conference Center, will partner with The New York Times. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
The university will co-sponsor online courses in seven areas of study with the Times’ Knowledge Network, an already established adult and continuing education program offered by the newspaper. Courses will be taught in architecture, arts management, business, cinematic arts, communications, medicine and politics.
The collaboration between the programs is the first of its kind in continuing education as a partnership between a for-profit institution and a university of USC’s size.
The opportunity to use both partners’ vast resources for continuing education where it might otherwise be unavailable was a major motivating factor behind the partnership.
“It allows [USC] to take some of our core academics and share it with the community at large,” Eileen Kohan, executive director for Continuing Education and Summer Programs, said. “[The partnership] gives us the opportunity to be viewed as one of the top continuing education programs.”
Courses, which begin Oct. 10, will be headed by current USC faculty with the participation of at least one journalist from The Times. Those who enroll in classes through the collaboration will also have complete access to the Knowledge Network’s offerings in writing, science, health and editing.
Felice Nudelman, executive director of education at The New York Times Co., noted the partnership’s exceptional ability to reach students around the world.
“This is a truly innovative way to offer a comprehensive continuing education program that will feature a broad course catalog and exceptional faculty,” Nudelman said in a statement. “Together we will establish a global online resource for students who are interested in maximizing their education regardless of geographic location.”
The program will also feature a program led by Times journalists and USC professor tailored specifically to high school students. If students take the entire six-course schedule, they can receive a certificate. Alternatively, they can register for one of two single-session
lectures.
USC and The Times are also set to launch the venture internationally in Hong Kong during the USCGlobal conference
Oct. 13. Many USC alumni are located throughout Asia and the collaboration hopes to bring continuing education to them with the program.
According to Kohan, response to the program has been tremendous and she expects it to grow considerably within the next few months.
USC alumni who enroll in the program will have a 10 percent discount available to them.
HILARIOUS!!!!
I’m sure these classes will all be “Fair” and “Balanced”….
Very cool! It’s great to see USC collaborating with other organizations in such innovative ways.

Whether you’re looking for that 50-year-old copy of Vogue magazine or the world’s oldest continuing database of animal biology, USC Libraries will soon have you covered.
Search · Senior Alwin Sasmita and junior Oivind Naess access one of the computers at Leavey Library that will soon feature new online resources. - Mannat Saini | Summer Trojan 
USC Libraries announced an addition of 33 new electronic resources Monday, including the popular fashion magazine and Zoological Record, adding to an already extensive collection of resources available to students, faculty and staff.
The new resources, which will be available by mid-July, includes new material library officials have been wanting to add to the electronic collection for some time.
“These research resources are far greater in number and far more in-depth and authoritative than what you might find through a typical Internet search,” said Lynn Sipe, associate dean for collections. “In many cases, these are electronic versions of extensive, primary resources that span many disciplines and geographic regions.”
Some of the more notable additions to the USC Libraries’ digital database include two ProQuest/LexisNexis collaborations on United States politics. Included in the addition is a database on legislative insight as well as a database of previously unpublished United States Senate and Congressional hearings.
Christian Grose, assistant professor of political science, recognized the importance of these often hard-to-find resources.
“Having these extensive databases is very useful for students and faculty and for anyone who wants to understand Congress or politics,” Grose said. “USC is ahead of the game.”
Gale, the educational publishing company, will provide many of the additions, including correspondence from prisoners held in German concentration camps just before and during World War II as well as databases that explore the world after the end of the war, both from the viewpoint of governments and those who experienced the Holocaust first-hand.
Stephen Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute, which has already archived nearly 52,000 video testimonies from Holocaust survivors and witnesses, lauded the additions.
“[The addition] will contribute to our continued efforts to develop USC into an internationally recognized destination for Holocaust and genocide studies,” Smith said. “We eagerly anticipate the launch of these new offerings.”
The addition of new resources is the single-largest since the libraries announced 59 new sources in July 2010.
More than 250 books written between 1962 and 1986 will be available for students electronically as part of the addition of the African Writers Series to the library’s digital database.
The series includes work from the likes of Chinua Achebe, noted Nigerian author; Steve Biko, outspoken South African anti-apartheid activist; and Nadine Gordimer, South African political activist.
Additions to the library’s digital resources, which can be accessed via the E-Resources tab at the library’s landing page, also include works on medicine, music and engineering.

Before he had the opportunity to taste his first authentic Philadelphia cheese steak, or even capture a glimpse of the Liberty Bell, Nikola Vucevic fell in love with the Philadelphia 76ers.
Talent · Former USC forward Nikola Vucevic became the fifth Trojan to be selected in the first round of the NBA draft in the last five years. - Seth Rubinroit | Summer Trojan 
“The Sixers were definitely my favorite team coming into the draft,” Vucevic said. “I wanted to get picked by them. I really liked coach [Doug] Collins, the rest of the staff, and the players I met.”
The Sixers reciprocated Vucevic’s admiration, drafting him with the 16th pick of the first round at the 2011 NBA draft on Thursday.
When the Sixers called his name, Vucevic wiped away a few tears and walked up to the stage at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J. to shake hands with NBA commissioner David Stern and receive his Sixers hat.
“It was by far the greatest moment of my life,” Vucevic said. “It was something that I dreamed about since I was little.”
The Sixers became enamored with Vucevic at the annual NBA draft combine in Chicago. He surprised scouts by measuring just under 7 feet tall in shoes, making him the tallest player at the combine. Vucevic weighed in at a muscular 260 pounds.
“The combine in Chicago gave me a great idea about where I was,” Vucevic said. “I saw that I was better than some of the guys ranked in front of me.”
Vucevic also had a brief, one-day workout with the Sixers in Philadelphia prior to the NBA draft, where he was able to get a better understanding of the organization.
“They have a great young team, and I fit in pretty well and want to help them,” Vucevic said.
At a press conference, Collins called Vucevic “a hard working, skilled big man with a desire to succeed, who gives us more size in the front court.”
Vucevic is expected to compete with Spencer Hawes for the Sixers’ starting center position.
“I will be able to play the [center] position in the NBA,” Vucevic said. “I learned how to play tough and aggressive in college.”
As a junior at USC, Vucevic averaged 17.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, as the Trojans earned an NCAA tournament berth.
Vucevic came a long way from when he averaged 2.6 points and 2.7 rebounds per game as a freshman. He was named the Pac-10 Most Improved Player as a sophomore and All-Pac-10 First-Team as a junior before declaring for the NBA draft.
Sixers forward Andres Nocioni currently wears uniform No. 5, Vucevic’s jersey number at USC. At his introductory press conference, Vucevic held up a No. 8 Sixers jersey.
Vucevic became the fifth Trojan selected in the first round of the NBA draft in the last five years, after Nick Young in 2007, O.J. Mayo in 2008, and DeMar DeRozan and Taj Gibson in 2009. Only four schools have produced more first-round picks during those years.
The Cleveland Cavaliers selected Kyrie Irving out of Duke with the first overall selection. Two Pac-10 players, Derrick Williams from Arizona and Washington State’s Klay Thompson, were selected ahead of Vucevic.
Former Trojan guard Marcus Simmons and forward Alex Stepheson were not selected in the NBA draft but could still sign free agent contracts or play overseas.

Nobody cares about Lonnie White. Nobody cares that as a former USC wide receiver from 1982 to 1986, White pocketed roughly $14,000 in extra benefits. Nobody cares that he sold his season ticket allotment. Nobody cares that, in doing so, he violated NCAA rules.
We’re numb to this now. Unless Yahoo! Sports were to learn Pat Haden, Lane Kiffin and Matt Barkley were operating some drug cartel south of the border, most of us are going to shrug our shoulders and just trot along.
We have read about extra benefits for months now. We have read about impermissible contact with agents, sports marketers, boosters, alleged boosters and runners. It’s quite the list.
Thus, White’s revelation of his prior transgressions in The Daily last week didn’t exactly move the needle much when it comes to such issues.
“Rent was overdue and my household bills were delinquent,” White wrote. “I needed the money to live, so accepting the $14,000 in different forms of ‘benefits’ over my college years three decades ago was an act of survival.”
But glancing over this would be unfortunate.
In the aftermath of scandals this past year at USC, North Carolina, Auburn and Ohio State, the issue of providing college athletes with greater compensation has reared its head yet again.
Highlighting a national discussion, namely in recent months, has been whether student-athletes, primarily those who happen to play football, should be paid. How much? How often? When? And from whom?
It’s far-fetched from a number of perspectives, at least in regard to some sort of full-scale payroll handed down from athletic departments to players.
Despite such complications, it’s not a moot point. The idea of increasing the player stipend, in the hopes of preventing players such as White from having similar problems in regard to rent payments remains the most practical option available. It’s an idea, at least, that USC Athletic Director Pat Haden seemingly gave a full endorsement in the wake of White’s revelation.
“The NCAA formulas used to determine student-athlete stipends are not appropriate,” Haden said in a statement. “Having interviewed 15 different athletes and broken down their stipend against their bills, they are left with about $5 per day for food.  I just do not think that is right.”
And as Haden points out, USC athletes, by virtue of living in Los Angeles in a Downtown urban sprawl, carry a heavier burden than most.
“The current formula does not take into account the different costs associated with going to USC and living in Los Angeles as opposed to Washington State and a small town like Pullman,” Haden said.
Typically, athletic scholarships cover tuition, which at USC is roughly $37,000 per year, but they do not, however, cover the cost of living, room and board, meals, etc., which is where stipends come in.
According to Haden, athletes living in non-university housing receive $1,100 monthly, which doesn’t necessarily equate to much once you factor in rent charges of nearly $900 per month.
Then again, would raising the stipend actually serve as a deterrent for players faced with predicaments similar to White’s from accepting extra benefits?
Would an extra $300 per month prohibit individuals, such as former Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor, from selling signed merchandise for thousands of dollars?
In all likelihood, no.
But it would, unquestionably, alleviate some of the pressures placed upon student-athletes, which still makes it an attractive option.
Granted, it would hardly eliminate wide-spread situations such as those similar to Terrelle Pryor and Ohio State, but it would be particularly beneficial to those such as White.
So what’s the hold up? The short answer: Lack of funds. The longer answer: Title IX.
Enacted in 1972 as an amendment to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title IX forbids discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid. It covers medical schools, law schools and, most notably, athletic programs despite no explicit mention of sports in its wording.
In particular, it stresses proportionality, which says the number of athletes from each sex should be equivalent to the school’s enrollment percentages. Therefore, if half of a school’s student body is made up of women, then half of its athletes should be women as well.
Thus, stipends must be proportionate as well.
USC, among other schools across the country, would be restricted from solely subsiding stipends for football players. It would need to cover all sports, from football, to men’s basketball, to women’s rowing.
That might be more money than most schools are capable of paying.
It’s certainly an issue that needs to be fixed — if only it wasn’t a logistical nightmare.

The answer to the USC athletes is obvious: get roommates. 
“According to Haden, athletes living in non-university housing receive $1,100 monthly, which doesn’t necessarily equate to much once you factor in rent charges of nearly $900 per month.”
This figure assumes an athlete is living alone. As soon as he gets one roommate, his share of the rent drops to 450 bucks, and he gets to keep the other 450 bucks. Both athletes receive the 1,100 stipend each, not combined. So, they receive a total of 2,200 dollars, with rent costs of 900. Add a 3rd roommate, also a full scholarship athlete, and you have 3,300 dollars received, compared to 900 going out. Each athlete would get to keep 800 dollars a month, just by living with 2 roomies.
While I agree that there needs to be a “fix” to how collegiate athletes are compensated, let’s share a few more facts.  Both the football and basketball teams have free training tables (i.e. excellent free food) every day so the $5/day food allotment is not accurate–these players aren’t starving!  Plus, there are living arrangements less than $900/month.   Our water polo son lives with 2 other players in a nice older home close to campus for $450/month each.  And yes, while he has his books covered with his scholarship, we pay for tuition, room and board.  And even though the water polo team has won three national championships there are no full scholarships, no training table and no lucrative pro contract potentially waiting despite being the best in the US at their sport.   These incredible young men are playing for the pure joy of the sport–what a concept. 
However, it’s understood that football brings in the big bucks so here’s a possible solution.  First, cut the scholarships to 66 but increase what each players gets…do we really need to subsidize the 3rd string?  Or, let the NFL cover the costs of the training of their athletes… let’s face it, the NFL benefits from these kids… so the NFL each year would identify the top players (say 600 but no more than 12 at a particular campus) who they deem are potential pro players and let them foot the cost of room/board and an agreed-upon living expense.  At the same time, these players take a different “track” in college.  They are not required to take a full load (let’s face it, some rarely go to class), but instead take a “pro career” track in which they take required classes in money management, public relations, hiring an agent, real estate, i.e. the kind of information that they are really going to need.  And each year, on the playing field, they earn the right to be on the top 600.  At the same time, the college gives these “chosen” athletes a full “return to campus” pass so that if they get hurt, or not picked up by the NFL, they can return to school all expenses paid within 10 years of leaving… this way, we aren’t abandoing them when life didn’t work out as planned.  Just a thought….
@USC Athlete Parent-Hey, I think you have a great idea. Being a student is hard at any age.  But I really like the idea of the “kind of information that they are really going to need.”  Everyone needs a backup plan.  So many athletes don’t make the big time, hopefully, they go on to graduate from college and become an upstanding, law abiding citizen.

Former USC pitcher Logan Odom’s baseball career has been punctuated by transitions; his MLB prospects teetering on the edge of oblivion. For a time, Odom’s journey playing an unforgiving sport appeared it would end with a whimper at USC. Odom, however, made himself into a MLB prospect last season and was rewarded with an eighth-round draft selection by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.
Perseverance · Despite being projected as a 40th-round draft pick in the MLB draft and enduring a bumpy road throughout his college career, former Trojan pitcher Logan Odom was selected in the eigthth round by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Odom starred as a position player at North Medford High School in Medford, Ore. Despite his accomplishments, both college and professional scouts were not impressed with the tools that belied his performance.
Odom decided to attend Western Nevada Community College, where he made perhaps a life-altering decision: converting to pitching full-time.
“Really, many of my transitions sort of happened on their own,” Odom said. “I just wanted to get out on the field. That’s what makes me happy. I figured pitching was my best chance to play professional ball.”
Flashing elite potential on the mound, Odom paced Western Nevada to a third-place finish at the Junior College World Series in 2009. Hitting the showcase circuit with his team, Odom caught the attention of USC hitting coach and recruiting coordinator Doyle Wilson.
“I went to a showcase in Las Vegas, and [Wilson] saw me there and talked to me shortly after that,” Odom said. “He then invited me to visit, and the rest is history.”
It was not quite that simple for the 6-foot-6 right-handed pitcher. Pitching almost exclusively out of the bullpen for the Trojans in 2010, Odom sported a 7.01 ERA in 43 and two-thirds innings pitched, nearly walking as many batters as he struck out.
Despite a disappointing season, Odom never wavered.
He set out to make adjustments, playing for the Mankato MoonDogs of the Northwoods League during the offseason and dazzled there, striking out almost a batter per inning.
“I put in a lot of work during the summertime,” Odom said. “I played in a summer league out in Minnesota. I received a lot of good coaching advice. [Former USC pitching coach] Tom House was a huge influence on me and helped me out a ton.”
After a successful summer and House’s tutoring, Odom nailed down a spot in USC’s starting rotation entering his senior season.
The turnaround was stunning, as the sinkerballer nearly halved his ERA to 3.96 and began to limit the amount of free passes he surrendered.
Endearing himself to Trojan fans, he experienced his greatest success against a talent-laden UCLA squad, tossing a combined 14 and one-third innings against UCLA over two starts, giving up one run.
MLB scouts took note.
Despite Odom’s marked improvement, few draft projections ticketed him for a selection before the 10th round, and some even had him as low as the 40th round. In a potentially historic draft with more high-end pitching talent available than ever before, Odom was not sanguine about his chances of beating those projections.
But then the Angels called.
“I was extremely excited,” Odom said. “The Angels are a classy organization. It was nice going in the eighth round — it wasn’t what I expected. The draft is a crazy process, and I couldn’t have asked for much more.”
As awe-inspiring as it can be to reminisce, however, Odom must transition to a professional pitching regimen, while also refining his mechanics and repertoire.
In his first start for the Orem Owlz — an Angels affiliate — in the Pioneer League, Odom lasted only one plus inning. Although he did not surrender a run, his peripheral statistics show where he needs to make his biggest professional adjustment: honing his command. In that one inning, he walked three batters and hit one.
“My sinker is probably my greatest strength — getting groundballs,” Odom said. “I need to work on my consistency. That’s the main difference between college and professional ball. In pro ball, you need to execute pitches all the time or you won’t last long.”
Although his transition to professional baseball has been marked by change — from the junior college ranks, switching positions and transitioning from a reliever to a starting pitcher —Odom has stayed the course.
Now, as a draftee of the Angels, it is difficult to bet against the young right-hander finding a way to make it work.
