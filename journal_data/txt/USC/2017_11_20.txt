USC secured the Pac-12 South and a spot in the conference title game with a 38-24 victory over Colorado two weeks ago. Let’s take a look at how the Trojans match up with the two possible North champions: No. 14 Washington State and No. 20 Stanford.
Washington State
The Cougars handed an injury-depleted USC team its first loss of the season in a 30-27 nailbiter in Pullman, Wash., in Week 5. Washington State’s pass defense gave redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold fits, limiting him to 15 completions on 29 pass attempts for 164 yards, an interception and a late fumble that sealed the loss. The Trojans found some success on the ground, rushing for 163 yards and three touchdowns, but those numbers were buoyed by junior running back Ronald Jones II’s 86-yard score in the second quarter. USC struggled to slow Cougar running back Jamal Morrow, who accounted for 138 total yards and two touchdowns on 11 touches. Washington State quarterback Luke Falk threw for 340 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, but did so on 51 attempts.
A four-year starter, Falk momentarily lost the top spot to redshirt sophomore Tyler Hilinski but regained control for wins over Stanford and Utah the last two weeks. Falk has been an efficient passer throughout his career, racking up yardage and touchdowns on a high volume of short pass attempts. As his 6.73
yards-per-attempt for the season indicate, Falk doesn’t have the arm to beat the Trojans deep, but he will methodically work his team down the field using quick reads and check-downs. Morrow and James Williams lead Washington State’s backfield, but they haven’t had much success this year: The two have combined for 892 rushing yards and four touchdowns on 5.3 yards per carry. They’re much more dangerous receiving out of the backfield, combining for 786 yards and eight touchdowns on 105 receptions.
The Cougars have also made their mark on the defensive side of the ball this season. They rank 11th in the country, allowing just 304 total yards per game. The defense is slightly more effective against the pass due to a swarming defensive backfield and pass rushers such as defensive end Hercules Mata’afa, who ranks ninth in the country with 9.5 sacks on the year. Darnold’s struggles against the Cougars were no fluke; the team uses pre-snap movement along the defensive line to confuse quarterbacks and force them into bad decisions (the Cougars have forced 27 turnovers this season).
Stanford
USC defeated the Cardinal 42-24 in Week 2 thanks to big performances from Darnold (21-of-26 for 316 yards and four touchdowns), Jones (116 rushing yards, two touchdowns) and freshman running back Stephen Carr (119 yards, 10.8 yards per carry). After giving up a 75-yard touchdown to running back Bryce Love early in the game, the Trojans’ defense stiffened, holding quarterback Keller Chryst to just 172 yards on 28 attempts.
K.J. Costello replaced Chryst before the Cardinal’s loss to Washington State three weeks ago, and while the redshirt freshman has been solid, Love unquestionably leads this team’s offense. The junior running back is second in the country with 1,723 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns on over 8.8 yards per attempt. Love rushed for 160 yards and a touchdown on 9.4 yards per attempt against USC in September, but without the long touchdown run, his stats fall to 85 yards on 5.3 yards per carry. Love already broke the single-season record for runs of 50-plus yards with 11, which could be an issue for a Trojan defense that is susceptible to giving up large chunks of yardage.
A lot of those big plays have come in the passing game, but Stanford has neither the personnel nor the approach to target USC’s weak secondary downfield. The way to attack USC’s defensive backfield is with deep bombs, as UCLA proved on Saturday, but Costello isn’t on Josh Rosen’s level, and Stanford doesn’t have the lightning-fast receivers that can burn the Trojans’ cornerbacks. 
On the other side of the ball, Stanford is ranked 90th in the country in yards per run attempt allowed at 4.7 and is giving up 171.7 rush yards per game. The pass defense is still good, allowing just 216.3 yards per game and 13 touchdowns. The Cardinal may give up yardage, but they rank 29th in the country in points per game allowed with 20.7. 
As of right now, the Cougars appear to be the tougher opponent. While lacking a top-level offensive playmaker like Love, their defense is better than the Cardinal’s on the ground and through the air. We will learn more about Stanford and Washington State this week, as both sides both play ranked opponents in No. 9 Notre Dame and No. 15 Washington, respectively. If Stanford can stand up to Notre Dame’s fifth-ranked rushing attack, feeding the ball to Jones and Carr may not be the best approach against the Cardinal. However, if Washington State’s offense can find traction against Washington’s fifth-ranked defense, the Cougars could be even more formidable than they were earlier this season. 
Path to the Pac-12 Championship Game
Washington State clinches a berth with a win over Washington, while Stanford must beat Notre Dame and also hope the Cougars come up short against the Huskies.
Stanford does NOT need to beat ND to make the PAC-12 Championship Game. The Farm only needs Washington to beat Washington State.

Senior guard Sadie Edwards was a focal point of USC’s offense on Monday, pouring in 25 points against Long Beach State. Photo by Alex Zhang | Daily Trojan
The women’s basketball team hosted Long Beach State on Monday night looking to continue its perfect start to the season and grab one last home win before hitting the road for close to a month. USC was dominant at home, cruising past the 49ers 75-60 at the Galen Center.
The Women of Troy broke off a 9-0 run to open the game and never looked back: Senior forward Kristen Simon opened the scoring with a layup before senior guard Sadie Edwards followed up with another bucket. Edwards led the way offensively for USC early on, pouring in 10 points in the first quarter alone.
By halftime, USC had extended its lead to 17, with Simon joining Edwards in double-digit scoring. Long Beach State guard Shanaijah Davison had an impressive 11 points after two quarters, but the rest of her team combined for just 12.
The Women of Troy cruised in the second half with their comfortable lead. Edwards finished with 25 points to lead the team in scoring, and Simon chipped in an additional 20, along with a team-best 12 rebounds.
Next up, the Women of Troy look forward to a trip to Hawaii. The team will participate in the Rainbow Wahine Showdown in Honolulu next weekend, facing Purdue, Marist and Hawaii on consecutive days.
USC will not return to the Galen Center until Dec. 15, when it hosts Texas A&M.
Where is freshman S. Aaron who has not played all season so far? She is the only real newcomer who
can help off the bench which is badly needed.
She’s redshirting because of recovering from a injury!
Thanks Debra, the best of luck to the team this season. Must stay away from injuries
to the starting five if any hope to make the tournament.

Senior guard Jordan McLaughlin rallied the Trojans to an overtime win over Vanderbilt on Sunday with a career-high 35 points. Photo by Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
Going into Tennessee to play an underdog Vanderbilt team proved to be a huge challenge for the 10th-ranked men’s basketball team. Now, the Trojans must get through Patriot League contender Lehigh on Wednesday night before their biggest non-conference test yet, when USC battles No. 16 Texas A&M at home on Sunday afternoon. 
The Trojans, fresh off a thrilling 93-89 overtime victory over the Commodores on Sunday, are looking to put in sharper performances this week against two teams that both have powerful offenses. 
Wednesday night’s home contest against Lehigh will feature a 3-1 Mountain Hawk team that has survived two overtime tests in the early going. In Lehigh’s wins over Marist (84-76) and Siena (91-90), the Mountain Hawks shot a combined 58 3-pointers, completing 24 of them for a 41.3 percent clip.
Vanderbilt nailed 11 of its 23 deep balls (47.8 percent) against USC on Sunday, including 10 combined 3s from Matthew Fisher-Davis and Riley LaChance.
For Lehigh, not only can starting guards Lance Tejada, Kahron Ross and Kyle Leufroy hit from beyond the arc (combined 21-of-58), but forward Pat Andree and bench star Jordan Cohen can also score from long range (combined 17-of-39). Considering USC allowed North Dakota State and Vanderbilt to complete 21 of their 52 combined 3-point attempts (40.3 percent), the Trojans are certain to cue in on their perimeter defense against a 3-heavy Lehigh ballclub.
The Trojans could utilize their 3-2 zone scheme once again Wednesday night versus an undersized Mountain Hawk squad. With improved play from junior 6-foot-11 forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu, the Trojans could ravage the guard-heavy Hawks on the offensive and defensive glass. The twin towers have combined for 79 points and 29 rebounds in the past two games and should impress again on Wednesday night back on their home court. 
Although USC’s tilt with Lehigh will be important to sustaining the team’s perfect non-conference mark, Sunday’s home matchup with top-ranked Texas A&M will be the game that could make or break the Trojans’ national championship momentum.
In last year’s road game against the Aggies, the Trojans squeaked out a 65-63 victory despite being down 7 points with 3:31 to go in the second half. Key offensive plays from senior guard Jordan McLaughlin and the rest of the offense secured a narrow USC victory over an A&M team that ended last season with a mediocre 16-15 record. 
More than a year after McLaughlin’s 13-point performance, the senior captain scored a career-high 35 at Vanderbilt, including two clutch 3-point buckets to send the game into overtime and then to give USC its initial 83-80 lead in overtime. 
To beat a 3-0 Texas A&M squad, not only will McLaughlin need to replicate Sunday’s performance, but USC’s entire offense will also need to fire on all cylinders. The Aggies demolished then-No. 11 West Virginia 88-65 before cruising past UC Santa Barbara 84-65 at home and beating previously undefeated Oklahoma State 72-55.
DJ Hogg, a 6-foot-9 stretch forward, scored a team-high 17 points in A&M’s last meeting with USC and has the opportunity to beat that mark this week. Considering USC’s inability to stop the 3-point shot this season, marksmen Hogg (9-for-13) and Admon Gilder
(6-for-10) could have a field day at the Galen Center if the Trojans can’t contain a Texas A&M team that is 51.2 percent from downtown this year.
Stopping the deep ball will be a key factor in wins over Lehigh and Texas A&M. But unlike USC’s matchup against Lehigh, Texas A&M also brings massive size. With the potential to start three 6-foot-10 forwards and still score buckets with a 6-foot-9 wing in Hogg, the Aggies look to be the favorite over a Trojans squad that features lengthy but undersized players such as Boatwright, Metu, sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic and freshman forward Victor Uyaelunmo.
A&M head coach Billy Kennedy could challenge USC with an interior emphasis on offense, leading to fouls for USC’s bigs that almost came back to haunt the Trojans in Nashville Sunday night. Against Vanderbilt, every USC starter picked up three or more personal fouls, and Boatwright fouled out late as the team racked up a season-high 26 personal fouls leading to 20 Vanderbilt points.
USC didn’t eclipse 23 fouls all of last year. This season, the Trojans have done so twice (25 fouls versus Cal State Fullerton).
Regardless of the foul totals, both of USC’s next two games are important not just for upholding the program’s No. 10 ranking and perfect season, but also for setting the foundation for conference play when the competition will rise and home-court advantage means that much more.
The Trojans play the Mountain Hawks at 7 p.m. Wednesday before facing the Aggies at 7 p.m. Sunday.

This week, the No. 13 women’s volleyball team will travel up to Eugene, Ore., to face No. 24 Oregon on Wednesday before battling No. 19 UCLA at the Galen Center on Saturday in the team’s final home match of the regular season. 
The Women of Troy (21-8, 13-5 Pac-12) started out the season unranked and were tabbed to finish sixth in the conference by Pac-12 coaches. At 13-5, they’re sitting in second place in the conference. If they can pick up wins against the Ducks (16-10, 9-9 Pac-12) and the Bruins (17-10, 10-8 Pac-12), second place is as good as theirs with Washington and Utah tied for third at 12-6.
Oregon is 11-4 at home this season, and USC is 8-5 on the road. Going into Wednesday’s match, the Ducks carry a three-match losing streak, and while the Women of Troy did have a five-match win streak, it came to an end against No. 4 Stanford last weekend. The team rebounded by sweeping Cal two days later. 
To pick up a win in Eugene, USC must stop senior outside hitter Taylor Agost. Against both Washington schools, Agost put up a team-high 36 kills while recording a .289 hitting percentage. Her 25 kills against the Cougars was a season high. She is the team’s go-to hitter, with 288 kills on the season. Right behind Agost is sophomore middle blocker Ronika Stone, who had a season-high 18 kills against the Cougars and 25 kills on the weekend. 
After playing the Ducks, the Women of Troy will head back to Los Angeles and the friendly confines of the Galen Center. USC has lost its final regular season match to the Bruins in the last three seasons.
But earlier this season, the Women of Troy opened up conference play with a riveting five-set victory over the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. After falling behind 2-1, then-No. 21 USC won the final two sets to top No. 11 UCLA
(25-21, 15-25, 18-25, 25-21, 15-11). It was the fourth time in the last six matches between the rivals to go five sets. 
Senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie led all hitters with a then-career-high 18 kills. She topped that for a career-high 19 kills against Washington in October. Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier was right behind her with 17 kills. UCLA dominated defensively at the net, putting up 11 blocks to USC’s four, but despite the strong defense, the Women of Troy produced a .251 hitting percentage.
UCLA will be coming off a Wednesday match against Oregon State. Last weekend, the Bruins split two matches in Northern California, losing to Stanford in five sets but sweeping Cal. 
USC is 10-1 at home this season, while UCLA is 7-6 on the road. To snatch a win over their crosstown rival, the Women of Troy will have to limit the Bruins’ strong offense led by senior outside hitter Reily Buechler, freshman outside hitter Jenny Mosser, sophomore middle blocker Madeleine Gates and freshman outside hitter Mac May. All four attackers have more than 240 kills on the season. Buechler, with 342 kills, is the only player with more than 300 kills. Mosser is close, sitting at 294 kills on the season. 
USC has three hitters — Lanier, Abercrombie, senior outside hitter Niki Withers — with more than 265 kills on the season. Lanier leads the Women of Troy with 378, followed by Abercrombie’s 354 kills. 
Wins against the Ducks and Bruins should set up the Women of Troy in strong position for the NCAA Tournament. The selection show will take place Nov. 26. The road to Kansas City for the national championship starts Nov. 30 with first-round matches. 
First serve against the Bruins will be at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center Saturday.

Angel Viscarra | Daily Trojan
Through the first three contests of its 2017-18 season, the No. 10 men’s basketball team hasn’t always looked like the top-10 team it’s been projected to be this season. While the Trojans have gotten off to a 3-0 start this campaign, the manner in which two of the wins have come has been concerning. 
USC is coming off a 93-89 overtime win against Vanderbilt  on Sunday night. The Trojans’ dramatic victory saw senior guard Jordan McLaughlin hit a game-tying 3-pointer with 28 seconds remaining in regulation to force the extra period of play. McLaughlin’s career-high 35 points against the Commodores helped propel USC to its third win of the young season. 
To USC’s credit, Vanderbilt is a formidable program that has qualified for the NCAA Tournament each of the past two seasons. And it certainly was impressive watching the Trojans erase a double-digit deficit against the Commodores with 9:37 remaining in regulation. 
But for the second time in as many games, USC has relied on scoring rallies late in halves to tie the game or take a small lead.
Blowout victories over non-conference opponents are what USC basketball fans are looking for early on this season — as a way to confirm whether the team’s preseason hype is tangible or simply smoke and mirrors. The longer the Trojans delay in delivering these blowout results over what are considered to be lesser opponents, the louder the skeptics will begin to clammer that this team is nothing but hype. 
Against North Dakota State (1-2), USC found itself tied with the Bison with 6:37 left in regulation. The Trojans utilized a 13-5 run late in the game to secure the 75-65 win over an underwhelming North Dakota State team. They also needed a 12-2 run to finish the first half to tie the game at 33 entering the intermission. A 15-0 run to finish the first half against the Commodores gave the Trojans a narrow, 35-34, lead at halftime against them.
Now, the Trojans did deliver a punishing, top-10 caliber victory over Cal State Fullerton (1-2) to open the regular season. In a game that saw junior forward Chimezie Metu record his first double-double of the season (18 points, 10 rebounds), USC doubled up Fullerton in an 84-42 victory at the Galen Center.
But even through three games, many questions still loom over the heads of this basketball team. On the court, we’ve seen the team overcome sluggish starts with a quick-strike offense that is as lethal as any in the nation, but there’s a new question emerging regarding the team’s effectiveness on the boards, as USC was out-rebounded by the Commodores Sunday, 38-28. 
However, the Trojans’ biggest question marks are the ones that they face off the court. As the preseason hype for USC piled on, the program was hit with controversy as assistant coach Tony Bland was arrested in September due to his alleged involvement in a corruption scandal that involved funneling college players to agents. Nothing casts a dark cloud over a program with national title aspirations like the type of scandal in which Bland is implicated.
And while Bland has been placed on leave and no NCAA sanctions have been issued against USC yet, it seems this legal incident is affecting the Trojans’ basketball team on the court early on this season. The long-term ramifications of Bland’s iniquities have yet to be determined. 
In the short term, USC has held sophomore forward De’Anthony Melton from playing in any of the team’s games thus far this season because of his potential connection to the scandal. Anyone who watched the Trojans last year knows Melton’s impact on the roster. Several scouts have projected Melton as a potential first-round talent in the years to come. Melton’s freshman year saw him lead the Pac-12 in steals (69) and average 8.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game; he received an honorable mention for the All-Pac-12 Defensive First Team. 
At this point, you can either see the glass half-full or half-empty as a USC hoops fan: You may think the team hasn’t put together enough dominant performances early on (sounds like a football problem for USC, too). Or you can look at things from the angle the Trojans have shown off some resilience in coming back to win their last two contests in heroic fashion. 
One thing that is certain for this program is that it has a relatively important slate of games coming its way. USC will host Lehigh on Wednesday night before taking on No. 16 Texas A&M on Sunday at the Galen Center. The Trojans’ tango with the Aggies will be an early barometer game for this highly ranked USC team. 
USC also has an upcoming rematch with SMU looming on Dec. 2. The Trojans eliminated the Mustangs in a first-round upset during last season’s NCAA Tournament, 66-65. The Trojans’ upcoming non-conference games will be vital in establishing the team as a contender, and not a pretender, going forward this season.
At the end of the day, especially in college basketball, wins are wins. While style points can be the icing on top of a program’s resume, maintaining an unblemished win-loss record is every top-ranked team’s aspiration during the non-conference schedule. 
If USC can replicate its efforts last season — that is, go undefeated during non-conference play — then it will establish itself as a team to be reckoned with come Pac-12 season.
Great teams find ways to win close games. USC has found ways to win close games early on. But is USC a great team? Only time will tell.

Recently, a video began to circulate around social media: Cellphone footage shot on a Bay Area Rapid Transit train shows an enraged white man yelling and hitting a passenger of Asian descent. It is a disgustingly familiar scene nowadays: shaky mobile evidence of racist tirades delivered by inexplicably unprovoked white customers — or, in this case, a public transportation passenger — against people of color. The video also usually plays as such: the angry bully berating a person of color who stands silent, weathering out the storm.
The other damaging aspect of these videos is more difficult to face and understand: Part of the reason I think people are so fascinated by these instances of visceral, uninhibited hate — this manifestation of xenophobia and racism — is that they seem so unusual. But in reality, racism is omnipresent — in angry public outbursts, institutions and systems and even everyday innocuous interactions. 
Most noteworthy about this footage is that the victim depicted, Charles Wu, stood up. He looked ready to fight, until a fellow passenger stopped him. I don’t know if Wu would have actually fought the man who physically threatened him. I wouldn’t have wanted him to. Violence against such a hateful tirade would not have been an effective solution to an attack with so much context, history and bloodshed behind it. 
I don’t enjoy watching these videos, and usually try to refrain from doing so in general, but there was something different about the power dynamics in this one: Wu, a man of Asian heritage, first (apparently, before the video begins) tells the angry man to cease a racist commentary, before standing up to him. “You think I’m afraid of you,” the perpetrator tells Wu, presumably confused why Wu has not backed away or changed seats because of the attack. 
“Never said that, sir,” Wu said. The man holds for a long moment, maybe surprised at Wu’s American accent, maybe surprised Wu said anything at all. One thing’s for sure: When white perpetrators bully and threaten people of Asian descent in public places, they do so without anticipation of resistance. They take strength in the idea that they are inherently more valuable to this country than the people they target, the same ideology that also hinges on the idea that their targets are stereotypically weaker.

What’s different about the BART train footage from other viral videos that have risen to infamy on the internet, is that here the viewer watches the bully’s understanding of who Wu is shifting before him. The power dynamics fall apart instantly — after the man attacks Wu, Wu stands up and the man backs away. 
Why the man began targeting Wu relentlessly is unclear in the video itself. But the tendency for Western society to view those of Asian descent as quiet and submissive, the men as fragile and the women as sexually exotic, is a horrible notion that leaks into everyday interaction — and certainly something more extreme in this case. It is clear that the perpetrator didn’t see in Wu somebody that also would present a threat. Growing up in Ohio and traveling with my own father (we are both of Asian descent), I’ve seen this sort of harassment directed toward him — not in this extreme, but in the same vein. What sort of thrill did this bully experience, standing over Wu, mocking him and threatening to hit him and then actually doing so? What a demented and sadly realistic parallel to the way this mentality operates in everyday behavior.
And for the bystanders around Wu who did nothing, and said nothing, that is understandable, because who wouldn’t be afraid if the moment of violence were directed toward them? 
Still, it is disheartening. Wu himself disparages this, in an interview afterward: “During it, I was just angry and frustrated that this guy is saying all this terrible stuff and no one said anything to stop him.” 
But it is also extraordinarily poignant that the one person, other than Wu, who did physically intervene, putting herself between the victim and the bully, was a black woman — talking close to Wu as the bully stood behind her, egging Wu on. It brings to light a sad and proven truth: In times of intense oppression, when people with hateful ideas are encouraged more and more, it takes a sense of intersectional unity to stay afloat.

I truly feel sorry for the author, who is obsessed with identity politics, race and ethnicity.  As an undergraduate at USC, which was ethnically diverse decades ago (no secret to alumni), I did not witness much overt racism but rather “classism,” that is, rich kids and others who went to good schools and pretended to be better than the less fortunate.  It wasn’t who you were but what you wore, what you drove, what city you came from, etc. that mattered.  Indeed, some of the wealthiest undergrads were of Mexican, black and Asian descent.  The main difference was that those ethnic minorities didn’t have chips on their shoulders, fit in easily with the Caucasian crowd, and otherwise were very confident, outgoing and assimilated Americans.  I saw no difference in the way most ethnic minorities were treated; in short, money — and looks — mattered more than brains, color, or anything else.  Fast forward to today, and it’s all about victimhood, identity politics, “white privilege,” lol, etc. 
IMO, anyone who gets into USC today, regardless of skin color or race, is privileged; the writer, one day, will appreciate this when she interacts with the less fortunate who didn’t graduate from college or never in their dreams could attend an elite private school like USC.  Rather than complain, she should be grateful she has a place at the USC table, stop whining about her past, and treat others with respect.  Rather than write about identity politics, perhaps she should write about politics, religion, or another topic that is more relevant to the USC student body.  In other words, USC’s diversity rarely affects the daily routine of most students, is neither intrinsically good nor bad but merely one characteristic of the college.
Her observation regarding a video, without any substantive analysis other than banal, unremarkable anecdotes, is not worth a serious discussion.
In general, I do not like the victimization culture we create when we bemoan racism as a cloud that pervades all of society. Let’s face it – some people are a-holes and some of those a-holes have racist behavior. I do have to say, if the white nutjob was berating a black person on the train, the news media would be all over the story, but a white person berating an Asian never gets a lot of ink because that does not fuel the victimization culture the liberal media wants to foster. Asians in general are doing well in society, so it is harder to sell a news story about society being racist towards Asians. The media is only interested in stories about racism towards Blacks and Latinos.
Be proud of your sexual exoticism. Would you rather be seen as loud, crass and bossy?
As a proud white male chauvinist pig, I do appreciate Asian chicks.
She’s got a legit point. But, the reason white people will bully Asians is because Asians got no guts. You can call them racial slurs, and they turn the other cheek. This is their excuse for “I take the high road; I’m civilized; I won’t stoop down to their level” but is really cowardice. I was at the Quiznos right there, across the street from the Coli, when I was a student, and these white students were “Ching, Chong, Changing” to a fellow Asian student all in “banter.” But Asian dude did nothing. He wanted their validation, so he acquiesced to their racist taunts.
Zoe, I have seen the video and clearly he is crazy man who needs help.  We all need a little help sometimes.
I’m going to pray for you both.
God Bless!

Last Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government proposed a mandatory student wellness course for first-year undergraduate students. If implemented, this course would begin as early as Fall 2018. According to USG Director of Wellness Marina Hrovat, the course would educate new students about a range of important campus life issues, from sexual assault and bystander intervention, to personal finance and mental health.
According to Hrovat, one of the main goals of the class is to teach students about the already-existing programs available to them as students at USC.
“One of the big gaps that we noticed is that students don’t know what the resources are on this campus, and it would be really beneficial to plug these resources in with first-year students,” Hrovat said.
This wellness class is severely needed, and frankly long overdue, particularly with regard to its emphasis on self-care, mental health and community. 
Hrovat’s plan speaks to the practical, tangible benefits of student wellness that universities often seek, and rightfully so. If students are better equipped to take care of themselves on a physical and mental level, they are more likely to succeed in their academic and professional pursuits, and contribute to improving USC’s national ranking.
And yet, this is not the only important difference that a mandatory wellness course could make here on campus. The lived differences that mental and physical wellness can make for students on a purely individual basis are also highly beneficial and deserving of acknowledgement.
As a society, we are moving closer to destigmatizing mental health struggles. We are seeing this across the country in media, politics and on university campuses. If implemented, this mandatory course could further contribute to this movement. By including mental health and wellness in the curriculum, this wellness course could facilitate crucial discussions about mental health. If students feel comfortable with sharing their personal experiences, everyone could benefit. 
While still reliant on a few individuals brave enough to share their experiences, that such dialogues in the classroom could have the power to create a powerful, internal movement of “Me Too” stories similar to what we are seeing on social media. Facilitating these dialogues in classrooms will likely make students who have been afraid to share or acknowledge their experiences with mental illness much more comfortable, and create safer spaces for them on campus. 
The discussions that will likely come about as a result of this course do not only benefit those already afflicted by mental health struggles, but could also help the rest of the USC community at large. Too often, individuals afflicted with mental health problems are told to be brave and reach out for help. But there is not enough of an emphasis on the rest of the Trojan Family to do some reaching out of their own to those afflicted. 
Class discussions for this course would make those students inexperienced with understanding mental health problems and symptoms more likely to notice when others may be suffering, and would prepare them to help. This could make all students more aware and active in ensuring that the members of our community feel safe to seek the help they need.
While USC already has taken some steps on this front, such as the Trojans Care for Trojans program, the University must go even further. How is a student supposed to call for help if they don’t know when help is needed? How can students who want to help their peers do so when they don’t know how? Ultimately, how can mental health be addressed on campus if the members of our student body don’t know what resources are available to them, and how to access these resources? 
This problem applies not only to issues of mental health, but also to all of the areas Hrovat says the course will cover. USC offers myriad resources to help students with many aspects of their everyday lives that they may be struggling with, and yet these resources help no one if the University does not educate its students about them.  
The benefits of a mandatory wellness class are ultimately two-fold. Not only will those suffering from issues related to personal well-being be more educated about the resources that USC has available to them, but also those who want to help their peers will be educated about how to do so. When our student body is educated about wellness, we will be able to create a conscious community that knows how to identify students in need of help, and educated about how to offer that help.
While this course, if implemented, will promote general education about wellness and self-care, its most powerful benefit could be bringing mental health dialogue into classrooms. This is an uncomfortable topic, and one few students would engage in if this were not a requirement. And yet, uncomfortable as it may be, it is deeply important to the Trojan Family, and makes a mandatory course like this absolutely crucial.

Parasitic administrators trying to justify their own existence.
There are dozens and dozens of worthwhile courses students could be offered.  Wellness may well be one of them.  But the push to make everything and anything that is worthwhile mandatory is wrongheaded.  There is not enough time nor money, and college students are adults who can make choices about what they would like to learn and when.

“Coco” tells the story of Miguel, a 12-year-old boy who dreams of being a musician and finds himself in the Land of the Dead, where he befriends his deceased relatives in skeleton form.
Pixar Animation Studios’ latest film, Coco, follows 12-year-old Miguel as he dreams of becoming a successful musician, despite his family’s ban on music. Miguel embarks on an adventure through the Land of the Dead, accompanied by his skeleton relatives,  as he attempts to uncover the truth behind his family’s history and prove to them his talent and passion. 
Pixar films are widely beloved because they include a sense of realism in children’s stories. Pixar treats its audience with respect, whether through the animation work or character choices. The studio’s best films have managed to resonate not only with children but also adults, as its less favorable ones have heavily relied on childish humor and over-the-top situations to market to a specific demographic. Although director Lee Unkrich adds sincerity to Coco by paying respect to Mexican culture, he sometimes loses this genuineness due to the PG limitations of family-friendly films. 
Pixar thrives on making complex and memorable character designs. However, Miguel, the film’s protagonist, is an overly simplified outline of circles and lines. The irony is that every other character’s animation is exceptional, each having distinctive details such as facial wrinkles or life-like clothing creases. Some are so impressive that, at certain points, one would swear they looked as close to real people as animation could make them. The skeletons in the world of the dead have varying shaped skulls and details like small chips that prevent them from looking like caricatures and easily reflect their familial connections to Miguel.
This desire to balance between a “realistic” and cartoon ambiance is also evident with the location designs. The buildings and plaza in the living world feel authentic to the culture, and little details like flower petals lying next to a curb greatly impact the atmosphere. The animators use these elements to showcase Pixar’s exceptional world-building capacity once again with the world of the dead, as the small space on screen is compacted with a multi-colored cityscape. However, if these extremely bright colors were toned down or blended with a few dull colors, the film would not be filling this heartfelt story set during Día de los Muertos with such tackiness.
Of course, the characters that live in both worlds need to be sincere to capture Pixar’s magic. The aggravating actions of major characters like Miguel and Hector, the Mexican trickster spirit who aids Miguel in his quest, are questionable at first but eventually, viewers will come to understand the relevance to their respective story arcs. The characters work best when they help each other through discipline or reasoning, as the viewers will understand all of their clearly defined motivations. When the film primarily focuses on one of them, such as Miguel’s abuelita, they can come across as annoying with their over-exaggerated movements and facial expressions, even though none of them feels completely out of place, overall.
All these characters are integral in creating a strong family connection, both in the worlds of the living and dead. While the film deals with these standard familial themes, it also uses the story to make thematic statements about the music industry. All of these themes combined help establish Miguel’s dilemma of wanting to become a musician when his family bans it because of broken relationships between family members and Miguel’s great-great grandfather. The film sets up many minor conflicts throughout the story and balances all of them very well. They seem trivial at first, but their “ticking clock” nature slowly creeps up on the viewers as they aimlessly wander around this vast and detailed world.
However, the film also relies on many predictable plot points, such as the two main characters temporarily parting ways, and character archetypes, but their inclusion is acceptable because they still push this story forward. Unfortunately, there are also moments, such as the side characters’ “silly” fight scene, that are so unnecessary that one will instantly know that they were included to abide by some proven algorithm for animated movies, as they drastically contrast with the rest of the story. Because the film tries to pay homage to Mexican culture, the use of childish slapstick is jarring, as it conflicts with the film’s intentions and disrupts its pace.
As pandering as this film got, though, it was an improvement from Unkrich’s last film, Toy Story 3, because the original ideas and genuine connection with the audience helped veer it away from being underwhelming. True to Pixar productions’ position at the forefront of storytelling through animation, Coco is astounding in its ever-improving design of people and landscapes. It doesn’t reach the incredible quality of Pixar’s past works like Finding Nemo or Up, but it’s a solid step forward.

Director Guillermo del Toro (center) observes Richard Jenkins (left) and Sally Hawkins (right) as they run through a scene. Photo courtesy of Fox Searchlight.
Master storyteller and director Guillermo del Toro’s latest feat of imagination is creating the movie The Shape of Water, one of the most unconventional love stories of all time — one set at the height of the Cold War and centered on a powerful mutual attraction between a mute woman and an amphibious creature. In a high-security government laboratory, Elisa, a cleaning lady portrayed by Sally Hawkins, lives a life of isolation until she stumbles upon a classified experiment and biological asset dubbed Amphibian Man, portrayed by Doug Jones. The two embark on a winding romance that merges elements from classic monster movies and film noir in a story that is equal parts haunting and enchanting. 
For del Toro, the basic premises for the movie were born a long time ago. A native of Guadalajara, Mexico, his childhood was full of ghost stories and fables — influences evident in the fantastical nature of his films. According to del Toro, the idea for The Shape of Water began when he was 6 years old as a love story involving a creature of the water. The film was not conceived until 2011, when del Toro’s longtime writing partner Daniel Kraus broached the idea of a cleaning woman in a government facility secretly befriending a creature held captive as a specimen. Immediately, del Toro recognized the story’s potential to become the next big fairy tale and bought the story from Kraus. 
“I knew at that moment that politically and dramatically, everything would fit because I was not entering through the front door but I was entering through the service door into the story,” del Toro told the Daily Trojan.
Each of the roles in The Shape of Water was written specifically for the actors who appear in the film. Elisa, along with her two allies — her black female colleague Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) and the gay artist Giles (Richard Jenkins) — represent a triad of characters who are marginalized, whether for their race, sexual orientation or disability, yet powerful nonetheless. 
In addition, del Toro does not shy away from the challenges of having two main characters, Elisa and Amphibian Man, who do not utter a single phrase of dialogue throughout the entire film. In the creature, the mute Elisa discovers a sense of comfort, solidarity and love that transcends words. 
“Words can lie but looks cannot,” del Toro said. “I wanted characters that could communicate emotion with the audience through looks and love and body language and essence. It’s impossible to talk about love. The idea is that Elisa and the creature have this [muteness] in common; they are not looked at as complete beings and yet they are.” 
With the character of Amphibian Man, del Toro wanted to upend the conceit of monstrosity by making him one of the leads and making those who oppressed him the antagonists. The romantic, sensual relationship between the creature and Elisa grounds the story with an edge of a familiar adult reality and allows the creature to express a humanity truer than that of his human counterparts. 
“Guillermo creates creatures uncorrupted by the human world,” producer J. Miles Dale said. “We can look at them as a kind of mirror to what we might be ideally.” 
The decision to set the film at the peak of the Cold War was purposeful on del Toro’s part, as he saw it as the perfect backdrop for a never-before-seen love story. In 1962, America was on the brink of nuclear war over idealisms put forth by President John F. Kennedy, while sentiments of paranoia and disillusionment persisted across the nation. 
“You need to, as a storyteller, choose where they take place and the time they take place,” del Toro said. “[The year] 1962, to me, is the last fairytale time in America, a time in which America kind of groomed itself into what we see as the modern America. It was really a time of great hope for the future. I thought that and the Cold War were the perfect settings to bring a creature from the ancient times and tell a love story in a time of discommunication.”
However, the tale remains timeless for del Toro. It comments on topical issues of today but is set in a bygone era, rendering it a fairytale about past troubled times that encourages audiences to lower their guards and be more receptive to the movie’s message.
“Movies that happen anywhere matter nowhere, but movies that happen any time matter at no time,” del Toro said. “The movie is about all problems today — about demonizing the other, about fearing or hating the other, and how that is a much more destructive position than learning to love or understand.”

As we approach Thanksgiving Day, I feel obligated to reflect on my life and what I’m most thankful for. I really only do this out of necessity — if I’m being honest, I find Thanksgiving to be a useless holiday. Apart from the lies and bullsh-t we’re fed as schoolchildren about how the first Thanksgiving brought two adversaries together, the holiday just encourages gluttony and excessive drinking — I don’t need a designated day to do that. And isn’t Thanksgiving just pre-Christmas anyway? The only real difference between the two is the color palette.
Regardless of my personal feelings toward the futile holiday, I still partake in all the Turkey Day shenanigans. There are some advantages, like having time-off from work and class. I always end up watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in the morning with my parents. At dinner, I witness the breaking of the wishbone between two extended cousins. And during dessert, I spew rehearsed platitudes when it’s my turn to say what I’m thankful for. But this year, instead of giving a half-assed response to the timeworn question, I plan to make a splash that will drench every attendee with every color of the rainbow.
This Thanksgiving, I’m thankful to be gay.
The reasons that I’m most thankful to be an ardent homosexual go beyond politics. Sure, it’s important to fight against the norm, especially in a political climate that once again aims to revoke all the progress LGBT citizens have made. But I’m even more thankful to be gay because I, for one, would not like to be a straight man in 2017. Or straight in general. Straight culture has ruined my life. The “straights” were responsible for Donald Trump’s presidential victory at the end of last year. They’re also responsible for the increase in homophobia I’ve experienced in the last 12 months since his victory. So what better way to spread the gay agenda than with a turkey baster?

All jokes aside, this is also the first year that I feel completely comfortable with myself. It’s been a struggle to finally get to this point. Though my family has made great strides in accepting my sexuality, it’s been a challenge to shake off shame I’ve internalized for so long.  When I came out 10 years ago (damn, has it really been that long?), I was immediately rejected by my family. I was fortunate to not have been put on the street as a result, but the prejudice I endured from them, from microaggressions to blatant discrimination, made me miserable. It took years of therapy for my parents to finally come around and accept who I am, but a lot of these ill feelings still weigh heavily on me today.
Likewise, I endured a lot of therapy to overcome the my past. And though talking to a therapist has helped, I can’t say I’m fully recovered yet. Maybe one never really recovers from such harsh criticism — however, I have gotten better about managing my anger. I try not to fester on what happened in my life years ago. 
My family now does its best to embrace my lifestyle, and that’s that only thing I can ask for. Even though Trump’s presidential win could give my extended family yet another platform to promote discriminatory ideals, interestingly enough, it’s been the opposite. I’ve felt an overwhelming amount of support from extended uncles, aunts and cousins. Many of them have met my boyfriend, Matthew, and have come to welcome him more graciously than I could ever imagine. I used to think that everyone was inherently homophobic until proven otherwise. Now, I’m starting to think it is the opposite.
If only I could tell my 15-year-old self that, in due time, everything would be OK. That the ones who were oppressing you in the moment would come to acknowledge their faults and alter their ways of thinking.
Though I tend to mask important issues with a fog of humor, I am serious when I stress I am thankful to be gay. In fact, I feel blessed. I wouldn’t wish oppression on anybody, but I wouldn’t have turned out the way I am had it not been for these formative years of struggle and pain. The hard times aren’t over though. I’m positive there will be more hardships to come in the future, but I feel ready to tackle whatever comes my way.

I’m curious about something, if I said I was thankful to the Lord to be born heterosexual, would that offend you?
Good Lord no! Does it offend you?
Thank you!  We are going to pray for you as well!
God Bless!
Even just a few years ago it was hard to imagine a future where gay would be good and marriage legal. As for turkey blasters, the very thought of the weird thing is good for an annual giggle. We have much to be thankful for.
It’s OK. This entire GLBT-P is nothing more than a mass Mossad psyop on European civilization while at the same time exporting Muslims into European societies. And you should be grateful for your own destruction.
Mr Chutzpah, please put down the pipe, drugs are not the answer.
Organized Jewry spearheaded the GLBT-P movement ever since the stonewall riots.
One thing, you’re not an American. You used this term – a mass Mossad psyop – that’s not what an American would be thinking, even a bigot on crack. My guess? Russian, or close Russian ally since you hate Jews, gays, and Muslims. How’d I do? Oh, and it’s LGBT, klutz.
Mr Hugh,
Please put down the pipe, drugs are not the answer.
A radical Muslim shot up Pulse Nightclub. And political correctness, like you, gave Muslims and Islam a pass. Diversity is not good.
And…………..Jews are behind the Islamic Invasion of the west.

When Marilyn Beaudry-Corbett attended the Marshall School of Business as an undergraduate student in the early 1950s, she was one of the few women at the school. But she didn’t let that stop her. She went on to enroll in the Harvard-Radcliffe program in Business Administration, and later returned to Marshall for her master’s in industrial sociology. Eventually, she became the chief operating officer for market research firm Audience Studies, Inc., according to Marshall’s website. 
Although women entering business face different challenges today than they did when Beaudry-Corbett was a student, these difficulties still exist — and Beaudry-Corbett’s $4 million donation to the Marshall School of Business hopes to combat that problem, by providing scholarships for female MBA students 30 and older, according to Trojan Family Magazine. 
“Marilyn Beaudry-Corbett’s extremely generous donation is visionary and courageous,” Marshall Dean James Ellis told Marshall News. “She understands firsthand the challenges women still face in advancing their business careers. Her investment helps level the playing field by offering [women] access to a critical educational opportunity.”
U.S. News reported that 36.8 percent of full-time master’s students are women, and at USC, 32 percent of the Marshall MBA program’s 2017 entering class was made up of women, according to Marshall’s website. Women also face gender gaps in corporate leadership — only one in five executives is a woman, and 60 percent of firms have no women on their board, according to a 2016 article from The Economist. 
“Marilyn’s gift is particularly significant given the events she lived through as a single, professional woman in an era when women weren’t necessarily allowed to be either,” Anne Ziemniak, the director of the Marshall MBA program, told Marshall News. “Despite those challenges, she went on to became very successful, and with her gift, she is in essence paying it forward to the next generation of women business leaders.”
Despite enjoying success in her corporate career, she decided to change course about 10 years later, and developed an interest in archaeology, according to UCLA Newsroom. 
She earned a master’s degree and doctorate in archaeology, from UCLA, where she later became a professor.
Like with business, pursuing a career in archaeology presented challenges for Beaudry-Corbett. According to UCLA Newsroom, the advisors she spoke to initially discouraged her because she lacked academic credentials for the career path.

This past semester, USC introduced its first-ever course on blockchain, one of the technological databases behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Taught by Nitin Kalé, an associate professor of engineering practice at the Viterbi School of Engineering, the course aims to expose students to the processes of blockchain and spur discussion of its potential impact on society.
Bitcoin is an emerging form of digital currency created in 2008, according to IBM, and blockchain is the technological database that oversees Bitcoin transactions. 
“I wanted to bring [blockchain] technology to students,” Kalé said. “[Blockchain technology] is where the industry is growing very rapidly. So companies, start-ups, people are trying to figure out how else to use blockchain to disrupt business, or some other industry.” 
In its first run this semester, the course was filled to capacity, and Kalé said he had to keep increasing the class size during registration due to its popularity. 
Other institutions like Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Princeton University have taught Bitcoin and cryptocurrency courses in their computer science departments for about two years, according to Kalé.
Kalé has been studying blockchain technology and Bitcoin for about two years and worked to create an opportunity for students to understand how the database works. He has pushed for a trial blockchain course to evaluate student interest and see if it will be implemented as a permanent offering.
“My near-term goal is in 2018, we will probably launch a specialization course by fall,” Kalé said. “Then by Fall 2019, if all goes well, I think we’ll have a minor in blockchain technology.”
In Viterbi’s Information Technology program, there are two types of programs: a minor, in which students are officially enrolled and required to take five or six courses, and a specialization, which only requires students to take three courses.
Kalé explained that although his first attempt to teach the course ran smoothly, he might have been too ambitious in his curriculum focus.
“It turned out I couldn’t cover everything that I’d wanted to, so I’m offering this course again in the spring semester,” Kalé said. “I’m hoping I’ll make the class more efficient, maybe work on the pacing some more, so we can get more topics into the class.” 
Various students have expressed their interest in blockchain technology, both before and after taking Kalé’s course. Daniel Aghachi, a junior majoring in business administration, was inspired to start his own organization, called the Trojan Blockchain Society, based on his growing interest in the technology.
“I realized there [is] no central hub for blockchain on campus,” Aghachi said. “There were events scattered around, and there was no one place to go. So I wanted to build a community of people who share the same passion as I do.”
Both Kalé and Aghachi emphasized the importance of getting students and faculty excited about blockchain, and how monumental this technology has been. 
Through a class activity, Kalé was able to send his students Bitcoin.
“In order to understand how blockchain works, you’ve got to understand every single step,” Aghachi said. “[Kalé] was so excited once we were able to get to the point where we understood how it all worked and put the pieces together, so he could send us each actually some Bitcoin.”

The USC Pacific Asia Museum will reopen on Dec. 8 after a year-and-a-half-long renovation of the nearly century-old building. Photo from USC Pacific Asia Museum.
After a year and a half of renovations, USC’s Pacific Asia Museum, located in Pasadena, Calif., is scheduled to reopen on Dec. 8. It underwent seismic retrofitting in late June 2016 to help bring the building up to USC’s codes of stability. 
“Pasadena is definitely a place where this cultural heritage is really at the core of the city and there’s a big commitment to that,” Christina Yu Yu, the museum’s director told Pasadena Now.  “Our museum can be a good case study and we are very eager to welcome our visitors and our guests back.”
The building that houses the museum was constructed in 1924 by collector Grace Nicholson and mimics the Imperial Palace courtyard found in Beijing. Many of the building’s materials were imported from China or are close replications of Chinese architecture. 
“When she commissioned the building, she was thinking of Asian experience, Asian art, and also a place for her to live in Pasadena right on the premises,” Pasadena Heritage Executive Director Sue Mossman told Pasadena Now. “That was pretty remarkable and forward-looking for her.”
In 1943, Nicholson gave the building to the city of Pasadena, which used it for art until 1971, when the Pacificulture Foundation took over. In 1987, the city sold the building to the Pacificulture Foundation, which renamed it the Pacific Asia Museum. 
USC partnered with the museum in 2013 to turn it into the USC Pacific Asia Museum. It strives to increase intercultural awareness of Asia and the Pacific Islands through immersing its visitors in art and culture. Through collaboration among a team of engineers, architects and preservation experts, the renovation is expected to help maintain the building’s history while ensuring it remains accessible to future generations. 
“The goal is to not create more change, but rather to fit new systems into the existing fabric,” Mossman told Pasadena Now. “The less change the better is a typical rule of thumb for a preservation project, but sometimes change is critically important because it makes a big difference for the longevity of the building.” 
The seismic retrofitting is only the first stage in a series of reconstruction, but it was the most extensive, costing millions of dollars. The museum offered moving exhibitions throughout the community, including at Doheny Library, during the renovation as the work had to be cleared from the building. 
“We even had to pack our 15,000 pieces of art and move it offsite,” Yu Yu said to Pasadena Now. “This is the only time we need to move the collection because we do not want to disturb these treasures from hundreds of years ago. In later phases we do not need to move our collection.”
During the renovation, staff also focused on conducting a permanent collection survey of the works in the museum. This will allow the museum to focus on future exhibitions based on current works, according to a museum press release. The construction also included a 700-square-foot expansion, which will increase gallery space for visitors.

No. 10 USC’s first road test of the year against Vanderbilt on Sunday was a gauntlet of lead changes, loud fans and senior leadership.
In the first half, the Trojans fell behind by 14 points but ended the half on a 15-0 run to take a 35-34 lead into the break. In the second half, they once fell behind by double-digits and needed every last possession to force overtime. But in overtime, the Trojans never relinquished the lead and ultimately won, 93-89.
On the final possession of regulation, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin pulled up a yard behind the top of the key. Without hesitating, he arced his shot high into the air, dropping it in to tie the game at 80-80 with 28 seconds to play. On Vanderbilt’s final possession, senior guard Riley LaChance ran down the clock before penetrating into the paint where he was met by a stern defensive wall. Three Trojans surrounded him and leaped as he shot. His floater fell short and the buzzer sounded before anyone came away with the rebound.
In overtime, McLaughlin picked up where he left off, scoring USC’s first 5 points. Vanderbilt called a timeout with 3:40 to play. After volleys of missed jumpers, junior forward Chimezie Metu scored a layup to give the Trojans a 7-point lead with 1:49 left; it was the Trojans largest lead of the night, and it would prove insurmountable.
Co-captains McLaughlin and junior forward Metu rose to the occasion, guiding their team through a rollercoaster of ups and downs. All night, the duo picked apart Vanderbilt’s defense with its pick-and-roll. McLaughlin finished with a career high 35 points, including 9 in overtime plus the last 3 in regulation. He shot 5-of-11 from 3-point range and 6-of-6 from the free-throw line. As a team, the Trojans shot 94 percent (15-of-16) from the charity stripe. Although Metu started slowly, shooting just 2-of-9 from the floor in the first half, he ended with 23 points and eight rebounds.
In the final 3:30 of the first half, it appeared USC had worked out its road opener jitters. During a 15-0 run, four different Trojans made five consecutive 3-pointers. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt did not even get a shot attempt off as it turned the ball over each of its last four possessions.
Nevertheless, the Commodores roared back to life in the second half due to an outstanding performance by senior guard Matthew Fisher-Davis. Fisher-Davis scored 31 points and recorded 11 rebounds. With 9:37 to play, Fisher-Davis sank a 3-pointer to give the Commodores a 62-52 lead, their second double digit lead of the night. However, that was his last field goal.
As he cooled down, McLaughlin warmed up.
With 2:24 to play, McLaughlin fielded a long rebound and pushed the ball coast-to-coast to score against a Vanderbilt defense with numbers. Furthermore, he drew a foul and completed the 3-point play to put his team up 73-71.
But, the Trojans were not yet out of the woods. Junior forward Bennie Boatwright picked up his fourth and fifth fouls with under two minutes left. When he fouled out, he left Vanderbilt’s Djery Baptiste at the line. Baptiste converted both his free throws to give Vanderbilt a 75-73 lead. Metu tied the game at the line on USC’s ensuing possession, and then Vanderbilt’s LaChance converted a three point play. Metu made two more free throws to put the score at 78-77 in favor of Vanderbilt, and head coach Andy Enfield called a full-court press on Vanderbilt’s inbounds play.
The inbounder, senior Jeff Roberson, connected to guard Larry Austin Jr. on a 94-foot football pass to beat the press for an easy lay-up and to extend the lead to 3 with 36 seconds to play. But on the other end, McLaughlin silenced the fans with his dagger from atop the key to keep USC alive.
The Trojans once again proved they play very comfortably down double-digits. Last year, half of their 26 wins were double-digit comebacks. This year, two of their three wins have come in similar fashion.
Furthermore, the Trojans should be concerned by their depth. For the second game in a row, the bench scored a 5 points — Sunday coming entirely from junior forward Shaqquan Aaron. Be that as it may, the Trojans advanced to 3-0 with a hard-earned road victory versus a Power-5 opponent. They will remain ranked in the top-10 for another week.
They apparently need their backs to the wall before they get in gear. If they can break off a 14 point run with a lead the the future will be so bright the Pandas will really need those shades!
Another good write-up Jonathan.

The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative will be led by professor Stacy L. Smith and builds on her Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, which is known for its studies on representation in the film and television industry. Photo courtesy of USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism announced the creation of the new Annenberg Inclusion Initiative last Thursday. Led by Annenberg professor Stacy L. Smith, the initiative will create a think tank with a focus on expanding inclusion in the entertainment industry. This work builds on Annenberg’s Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, also led by Smith, which focuses on diversity in film and television. 
“Our new name reflects our continued and unwavering commitment to championing inclusion in all forms — including but not limited to gender, race/ethnicity, LGBT, disability and now mental health — across the media industry at a time when the climate makes it clear that our solutions are more needed now than ever,” Smith said to USC News.  
Annenberg’s Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative has done extensive research on diversity in the film industry, studying the demographics of the top 100 highest-grossing films since 2009. However, the group has seen little difference in its nine years of research.
With the new Inclusion Initiative, Smith hopes the group will not only research these trends, but help fix them. In this way, Smith also told The Hollywood Reporter, choosing the word “initiative” was purposeful. 
“We don’t want to set up as a center or an institute, because that sounds like we’re permanent,” Smith said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “The goal is to eradicate this problem and move on to something else.”
In order to face inequality, the initiative will focus on three major components: research, by offering advice on where diversity is lacking; advocacy, by speaking out on the behalf of marginalized groups; to provide easy steps to help foster change. 
“We are eager for companies and individuals to work with us to understand where there are glaring inequities and determine how best to solve them,” Smith said to USC News. 
Annenberg also announced that the initiative will include the creation of an advisory board, consisting of leaders from big names in entertainment such as The Walt Disney Company, NBC and HBO, in addition to foundation leaders. The initiative’s first study will be released in early 2018 and focus on the depiction of mental health in the film industry.
“The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative is a leader in addressing inequality in entertainment and by expanding their work to include examinations of mental health in storytelling and inequality in all aspects of the music industry, its work will continue to be the gold standard,” Annenberg Dean Willow Bay said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “Combining its track record of excellent work with Dr. Smith’s innovative solutions, the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative will be a true force for industry change.”
