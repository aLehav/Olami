Nearly 250 people, some wearing “protect Roe v. Wade” hats and holding a poster with the slogan “Trojans vs. Trump,” gathered Wednesday at E.F. Hutton Park for the Rally for Inclusion and Tolerance. The rally was led by Professor Tania Modleski, who expressed the importance of supporting those who feel impacted by the upcoming administration.
Falling on Jan. 18, two days before the inauguration, the rally at USC followed UCLA’s #J18 initiative, which encouraged faculty and schools to teach, organize and resist, according to Modleski.
Modleski read the #J18 intentions, which include teaching about the agendas of the new administration, organizing against violence directed toward minorities and resisting the institutionalization of ideologies.
The rally featured speeches, poems and book passages from faculty members and professors from the University. 
Niels Frenzen, director of the Immigration Clinic at the Gould School of Law, spoke about the uncertainty for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy caused by President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign, which impacts undocumented students, including USC students. Frenzen also expressed concern regarding the incoming administration’s potential use of raids to find and deport undocumented immigrants.
“We don’t know what the new president is going to do with DACA,” Frenzen said. “This lack of clarity and lack of knowledge in regards to what the new administration is planning on doing in the immigration area contributes to their fear. We haven’t seen raids in decades. Are we going to go back to that?”
Frenzen also invited those in attendance to “know their rights” and shared handouts explaining immigrant and constitutional rights in both English and Spanish with those in attendance.
William Vela, director of El Centro Chicano, also expressed his concern with the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.
“This is a surreal time,” Vela said. “I keep telling my students that I have never seen anything like this. I can’t tell you what’s going to happen because I just don’t know.”
Despite this, Vela remained optimistic.
“I really do see the positive in this,” Vela said. “I think it will bring us closer and help us understand who we are.”
Bryn Ziegler, a junior majoring in fine arts, attended the rally and said that the administration “threatened the people she loves.”
“I care about racism, sexism and xenophobia not getting a foothold in our country, now that we’re moving toward progress,” Ziegler said. “It’s important to feel that there are people we can go to and people who care about this as much as I do, as a student.”
Modleski said that Trump’s victory was unexpected, and that she anticipated he would not prevail.
“It’s unbelievable that this could be happening,” Modleski said. “This man stood for building walls and registries for Muslims, encouraged hate speech [and was] the worst misogynist.”
For many like Modleski and those who attended the rally, Donald Trump’s campaign and platform perpetuated negative stereotypes and normalized hate speech toward minorities.
Karen Tongson, an English and gender studies professor, also spoke at the rally. Tongson read a passage from the Queer Nation Manifesto and invited those in attendance to “build a community of lovers.”
Modleski said she hopes that rallies like these prompt USC to protest injustices.
“This rally isn’t going to accomplish miracles, but it’s a way for people to come out and speak out for those who are vulnerable,” Modleski said. “I really hope this rally changes how people see this institution and how this institution acts.”
Modleski also invited those in attendance to events happening near USC on the cusp of the Presidential Inauguration, including a walkout planned for Friday at 11 a.m. 
Viet Thanh Nguyen, a professor of American Studies and Ethnicity, also encouraged everyone at the event to follow the words of Martin Luther King Jr. and “break silence every day.”
“People like John Lewis and Martin Luther King Jr. used stories and rallies and protests to change the story of what America was, is and should be,” Nguyen said. “Whenever it’s a time to break silence, it takes courage, but it also takes imagination.”

Jane Li, a junior in the Iovine and Young Academy, began a social campaign aimed at inspiring people who feel disillusioned by the current political and social state of the country.
Li began designing and printing stickers in November with the intention to remind people to maintain a positive attitude. Right now, Li is in the process of selling the stickers and collecting the proceeds. Li plans on donating them to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America within the next two weeks.
Influenced by her own sentiments regarding this year’s results of the U.S. presidential election, Li started her campaign by drafting a design that reads “We Gon’ Be Alright,” drawing lyrics from Kendrick Lamar’s hit rap song “Alright.”
After posting the design on her personal social media accounts, she said she received positive feedback from friends and family. Li was encouraged to create her design into a sticker, citing the constructive tone of progress in the song lyrics.
“I wanted to do something related to the election and release my emotions,” Li said. “I thought a little bit more about the situation and realized I should change my attitude by making it more positive.”
Li commended the counseling services provided by the Engemann Student Health Center and said that she wished to contribute her own efforts to the cause of improving the emotional well-being of her peers. That’s when Li began distributing the stickers.
“I think mental health and social good are extremely relevant, especially on college campuses like USC,” Li said. “Many students are still dealing with the election results and upcoming Inauguration Day.”
So far, Li has shared her stickers with various political groups as well as design and typography groups. She reached out to these organizations through Instagram and by email, marketing her product independently.
Li is donating her proceeds to a nonprofit organization committed to raising awareness about the consequences of anxiety disorders in children and adults. The organization also works toward developing cures and improving treatment for those who suffer from anxiety.
Li chose ADAA because it is one of the few organizations that provides free resources for individuals experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety. Apps are available for download.
“I did a lot of research online for organizations,” Li said. “I knew I wanted a group that dealt with depression and mental health because I feel like that is the most direct consequence of the events that have been going on.”
Working in collaboration with ADAA, Li attached brochures to include with her stickers. ADAA in turn advertise her designs on its own social media websites.
For now, Li is focused on getting the word out about her current design before Inauguration Day. Based on supportive feedback, Li is considering expanding this campaign in the future by creating more designs. She is still interested in continuing to donate to ADAA.
Li said she realizes that there are other troubling issues that could induce stress in university students. She mentioned that apart from the results of the presidential elections, she was also bothered by the celebrity deaths in 2016. Li said she feels sympathetic to students who feel overwhelmed by their academics at USC.
Li is considering working in design-related fields after she graduates from USC. Li said that she has an interest and passion for instigating social cause and wishes to continue on this path.

Professor Yawei Liu led a discussion on Chinese perceptions of President-elect Donald Trump and how that might have an impact on future U.S.-Chinese relations Wednesday.
Liu said that China has to decide whether to bait Trump to create conflict or attempt to make peace with the President-elect.
“I think it’s going to be more of the latter,” Liu said. “China is going to be patient, relying on Trump’s advisers to educate him and help him to understand that their relationship is too big to fail.”
He said that while many believe that Trump’s actions have caused further division between them, there may be a chance for improvement. 
“There are some who think that the more problems Trump creates, the more opportunity there is for reform,” Liu said.
Some of those reforms may come in the form of increased dialogue about the elements of American democracy. Recently, a top Chinese official sparked an outcry with his words about judicial independence.
“Chief Justice Zhou Qiang said that checks and balances were a Western poison,” Liu said. “This was widely reported and received a lot of backlash.” 
The outcry from the Chinese people eventually caused the speech to be taken down from the Internet. Still, many of Trump’s actions, like praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, have drawn criticism from the Chinese government. 
“America has never taken land from China. Russia has taken millions of acres of land,” Liu said. “The Chinese are gravely concerned, but there is nothing they can do about it.”
One of the issues plaguing Chinese-American relations in the future is China’s record of human rights abuses. Initially, Western politicians believed that giving China exposure to capitalism would help correct this, but ultimately this proved ineffective.
“It’s too simplistic an idea that introducing the market economy would change China,” Liu said. “When Western leaders realized this and became disappointed, they created a grand new strategy.” 
Liu described an ultimatum in which China would have to prove that it cared for its people or lose American trade. 
“In the long run, China will not be in picture.” Liu said, noting that if there is no change in China’s behavior, eventually American values will put a halt to trade.
Jiao Zhou, a junior majoring in business administration, felt that this was especially concerning because trade between the United States and China appears to be reliable.
“The two systems probably won’t work, China and the United States, because the political situation is so complex, so different,” Zhou said. “People always say that global trade is very important. Trade is so interconnected so the market will work together, but you never know what the future will be.”
Another source of contention discussed was China’s currency, which is kept artificially low compared to other currency values to promote trade.
“Trump has promised that on day one, he will label China as a currency manipulator,” Liu said. “Recently, China has allowed the exchange rate to flow.” 
While Liu is not sure how China will respond, he said he believes it will bide its time.
Bill Preston, a USC alumnus who also attended the event, said the only way to work through tension is through engagement and open dialogue. 
“We’re either going to live together as brothers and sisters, or we’re going to perish as fools,” Preston said. “It’s so much easier to be civil toward one another if we engage each other. We have so much in common with each other, we need each other and we have to work together.”

The story of Daniel McLaughlin’s love of music begins, like any proper rock opera, with a badass grandma.
“The first band that I was into was Green Day, the American Idiot album. I remember having my grandma take me into Borders before it went out of business. I wasn’t allowed to buy the album, but I got my grandma to buy it for me,” he said about his tween years. 
McLaughlin is now a senior in the USC Thornton School of Music’s studio guitar performance program, and the music I’ve heard him play is a diplomatic mix of jazz standards and indie folk. A tall, soft-spoken guy whose original music might best be filed under “gentle rock,” McLaughlin made me curious what artists he listened to in his free time. 
I cornered him in a practice room last week to ask, expecting McLaughlin to hand me the kind of laundry list of obscure guitar virtuosi that guitar majors trade like business cards. But McLaughlin surprised me with his mainstream tastes, even as he confessed that he’s come a long way from the music that he listened to as a middle schooler. 
“What made you want to play guitar?” I began.
“Guitar Hero. Don’t put that on there. But yeah, that ‘Cliffs of Dover’ song,” he said, referring to an Eric Johnson guitar solo that, lanced open, would ooze raw testosterone. “I’m totally putting myself on the teenage-angsty pedestal right now.”
But it was destiny: McLaughlin fell in love with the crunchy stasis of the backbeat. Once he transitioned from plastic to wood axe, McLaughlin learned all the classic rock staples he could. 
“I had a goofy little middle school band, and the only songs we played were ‘Sweet Child O’ Mine’ by Guns N’ Roses and ‘Paranoid’ by Black Sabbath. And AC/DC’s ‘Back in Black,’” he said.
It was around this time that McLaughlin’s grandma took him to buy the Green Day album, and McLaughlin began to scratch a growing itch: He wanted to become a professional musician.
I first asked him about why he decided to become a jazz music major after being in a slash band.
“Well, it all started going downhill when I start —” he laughed. “I just thought I’d put a rata-tat-tat in there.”
After I promised to preserve the rata-tat-tat, McLaughlin continued: “It was when I decided I wanted to become a recording engineer and go to the Berklee College of Music.” 
That’s a music school in Boston well-known for its jazz and music production programs. “I found out that I couldn’t be a subpar musician and go to Berklee. So I went to find a guitar teacher who went to Berklee.”
The teacher ended up being “pretty good.” He had McLaughlin learn jazz standards — well-known tunes like “Autumn Leaves” and “Blue Bossa” that jazz musicians play at jam sessions and background music gigs. Jazz standards also form the audition material for most jazz programs. McLaughlin didn’t realize it at the time, but he was preparing for his admission to the USC guitar program.
When McLaughlin learned that music producers often struggle to stay financially afloat, he decided to devote himself fully to becoming a guitar performer. He put his plans of attending Berklee on hold, setting his sights on USC instead. When he didn’t get in as a high school senior, he took a year of courses at Irvine Valley College and reapplied as a transfer student.
One of the reasons he succeeded with his second application was that playing with Irvine Valley College’s big band exposed him to a new musical challenge: sight-reading.
“It was my first time being in a band, and I sucked at it because I had to sight-read. I still don’t know how to sight-read!” McLaughlin said. “We played a bunch of Tom Kubis charts. He did some really dope arrangements that were kind of Count Basie but then also had some counterpoint stuff that was way cool.” 
The challenge helped McLaughlin’s jazz skills take off.At USC, McLaughlin interests have expanded beyond classic rock and jazz, but he maintains that he loves music that’s relevant and heartfelt. I asked him to recommend a few records. 
McLaughlin first named a pair of Kickstarter albums by indie rocker Kevin Devine: the solo album Bulldozer, and Bubblegum, with Devine’s Goddamn Band. McLaughlin admires Devine’s solo pieces most of all.
“A lot of them aren’t about love — the typical party rock star thing. It’s a lot of political stuff. He had one called ‘Private First Class’ that spoke to the problems in America right now,” McLaughlin said.
In a YouTube video titled “Private First Class,” Devine explains that the song is about Chelsea Manning, the soldier convicted of espionage in 2013 for disclosing sensitive military documents to WikiLeaks.
Meanwhile, Bubblegum’s title track makes a clear nod to Green Day. It’s striking how as McLaughlin has graduated to mellower music, he maintains an interest in the kinds of sounds that first stimulated his guitar playing as a teenager.
McLaughlin also cited folk singer Blake Mills as a major influence on his own playing.
McLaughlin said, “He’s kind of folk, but he uses, like, flat six chords and you wouldn’t know it”— a harmonic gesture more typical of prog rock than folk, perhaps with some exceptions in The Punch Brothers’s catalogue.
“He’s got this one track called ‘If I’m Unworthy.’ I thought he was using a step sequencer. But no, he’s doing the bass notes with his thumb, swinging the eighth notes with his fingers,” McLaughlin said, a guitar effect that makes the tone interrupted and jolted.
“You’re very inspired by musicians who are both soulful players and technical innovators,” I observed.
McLaughlin agreed, but offered a counterpoint: the acoustic rock misfit Elliott Smith. 
“He believed in not playing super loud, because he was screamed at as a kid,” McLaughlin said. “Closer to the end of his life he said he was practicing 10 hours a day and surviving on a diet of nothing but heroin and ice cream.”
“His Either/Or album has influenced a lot of the people I listen to today. It’s mostly just acoustic guitar, not great recording quality. He’s not a great singer either. But he just wrote these songs that spoke from the heart. I hope someday people will emulate him in that way.”
“It’s hard to get away from the judgment. It’s hard to get yourself to that point where you put it out there.”
I asked McLaughlin whom he modeled his own songwriting after, and he emphasized his admiration for Smith. 
“I’d really like to be able to write words like that — that evoke a feeling,” he said.
McLaughlin said he hopes to communicate emotion with the same kind of precision when he performs his senior recital in April. 
“My dog died over the summer. That was my first major league hit to the heart that was like, this was a big part of my life for a little while,” he said. “But she was old, and it was her time — she lived five years longer than her life expectancy. Those emotions came out as this instrumental song that I’m thinking is just going to be more of a feeling.”
As much as McLaughlin’s musical tastes have changed, he still enjoys talking music with his grandma. I asked him to bring some records with him to our interview to photograph, and I asked him about a worn vinyl of Meet the Beatles!
“This one’s worth like $120. It’s a first edition,” he said. “This summer, my grandma tells me, ‘Hey, you need to help me clean out my garage.’ Then she goes, ‘Here are the records that I listened to when I was younger.’ I opened it up and there were first editions of Prince’s Purple Rain, and four or five Beatles albums. A lot of old jazz records, too.” 
I ended our interview with a question musicians love to ask each other: “Is there a moment when you really felt like you were in your zone musically?”
“I felt like that at my recital last year. Especially on that one song that I sang with Hayley, that Blake Mills song, ‘Seven.’ I’m trying to work in some more vocals into my senior recital. I’m not looking to be a pop star. I’m looking to make an impact,” McLaughlin said.

The Los Angeles Chinese American Museum will open Roots: Asian American Movements in Los Angeles on Jan. 19 to document Asian American political activism during the Civil Rights movement. The exhibition, which spans from 1968 to the 1980s, will feature over 250 photographs, posters, oral histories, periodicals and other artifacts to showcase the Asian American plight for equality following the Vietnam War.
Roots, according to the museum website, aims to probe the question of what Asian American identity represents and its various influences on modern American culture. The exhibition’s goal is to portray the conflict of revolution sprung out of young activists in times of turmoil. It hopes to accomplish this objective by displaying an arrangement of artifacts from different people and groups within the Asian American community of the 1960s through the 1980s to best represent the circumstances they had experienced. 
The team of curators behind Roots includes curator Ryan Wong and assistants Phyllis Chiu, Kathy Masaoka, Karen Ishizuka, Andre Ting and Florante Ibanez. Ryan Wong explained that his motivation to create Roots stemmed from a yearning to understand more about himself.
“I started researching the Asian American movement as a way to understand my own political identity,” Ryan Wong said. “Because we are taught so little about Asian American histories in school, we have to seek them ourselves.”
Chinese American Museum’s interim director Sharon Chen pointed out that not only are Asian Americans underrepresented in school-taught U.S. history but that they also lack visibility.
“Exploring the roots of APA activism through our exhibit is significant because APAs are perhaps one of the most dynamic, yet least visible, communities of color,” Chen said. “Through Roots, CAM aims to highlight the ways that APAs sought to define themselves while empowering their own communities. Through artifacts, photographs and oral histories, we hope to bring new light to the stories of the APA social movement in L.A. that are still so important to us today.”
Ryan Wong added that the exhibition is not meant to be a reminiscence, but exists to serve as a reminder for Asian Americans today of the importance of political organization and protest. The location of the exhibition — downtown Los Angeles — is also significant in its history of being a center of pan-ethnic solidarity during the Civil Rights movement. 
“Inspired by international Third World liberation movements, Asian American Movements were national in scope but locally driven,” Chinese American Museum staff curator Steve Wong, who assisted in researching the collection, said. “This exhibit examines how Los Angeles helped define what it means to be Asian Pacific American today.”
Roots will hold a members-only preview on Jan.19 from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., followed by a public reception from 6 to 9 p.m.

Hidden away in the heart of Little Tokyo, Los Angeles’ newest cafe comes with a tea twist. The bright atmosphere, friendly staff and open seating makes Midori Matcha both a fun place to visit for exploring tourists and a comfortable place to study in for hard-working students who need a little escape from campus. 
Midori Matcha’s bright green walls capture customers’ attention immediately; the walls frame the menu and bakery case. The cafe is bright, but not gaudy. The wooden walling, matching tables, small succulents and large LED logo on the wall all add a hip, minimalist feel to the small cafe. The design creates a welcoming atmosphere for everyone.
In addition to its tasteful decoration is the cafe’s love and appreciation for all things matcha, a specially ground green tea commonly used in traditionally Chinese and Japanese tea ceremonies. Matcha has only recently become popular in the United States, especially for its health qualities and distinct flavor. All of the cafe’s matcha is freshly imported from Japan and maintained to be non-GMO, vegan and organic. 
Midori Matcha is definitely here to make its mark on Los Angeles’ healthy cafe-going community. Matcha has the nutritional equivalent of 10 cups of regularly brewed green tea, and its menu items, from coffee to ice cream, are all infused with the tea’s distinct flavor.
With such a diverse number of options available on its menu, there is something for every tea lover. Drinks range from simple $5 matcha Americanos to a $6 matcha blueberry puree or $6 matcha limeade. Their organic ceremonial grade matcha is 100 percent stone-ground, meaning that there you will definitely not be tasting any powers, only the natural freshness of the tea leaves. 
The friendly staff always gives the option to increase the sweetness or strengthen the tea flavor depending on your preference. Out of all of their drinks, a big favorite is the iced matcha latte. Upon request, the staff might publicly grind the matcha, proving that their process is the most natural it can be. It is clear to see that Midori Matcha and their team are dedicated to maintaining the health benefits and taste of matcha in its most authentic form. 
Even for consumers who aren’t looking for a drink, Midori Matcha offers a variety of matcha-infused foods. One of their best-selling foods is their organic matcha beignet, a dough pastry filled with matcha-infused cream. However, they also offer matcha soft serve, matcha puffs and matcha creme brulee. 
Although the cafe is incredibly new, a steady stream of customers were always ordering. Their friendly staff and unique products all draw in pedestrians and shoppers. The cafe is never empty, which speaks towards its future success. 
While definitely on the pricey end, Midori Matcha’s sizing and taste definitely make up for it. For all those exploring what Little Tokyo and downtown Los Angeles have to offer, Midori Matcha is the go-to place to stop by and try out. 
This is definitely where to go for tea lovers who appreciate the work that goes into maintaining organic foods and like taking on unique drinks with a strong kick.

New research about the gender wage gap shows that for millennial women, there’s good news and there’s bad news. The good news is that, according to the Resolution Foundation, the gender wage gap for millennial women new to the workforce has dropped from 16 percent for Baby Boomers women to 5 percent for millenials. 
The bad news —because these days it seems victories for women must always come with some — is that the same Resolution Foundation study found that women in the millennial generation, upon hitting their mid-40s, are projected to make 30 percent less than their male counterparts. A Pew Research Center study attributed this to the persistence of traditional, gendered expectations of female employees and motherhood. These expectations are reflected in recent research by Cornell University revealing that female employees were 8 percent less likely to receive promotions after a law guaranteeing their right to comprehensive maternity leave — but not family leave — was passed in the United States. 
In light of these facts, it is clear that we must fight for a family leave policy that doesn’t burden women, policies that require employers to justify higher wages for male employees whose experience and qualifications are similar to those of lower-paid female employees and above all, we must protect women’s right to negotiate without retribution.
The fact that research shows that millennial women are poised to join their male peers in the workforce as near-equals, and perhaps even outdo them, but lose equality at an older age is concerning. Deteriorating progress at the hands of discriminatory norms when women reach their 40s raises the question of what younger women can do to prepare themselves to fight the injustice that appears to inevitably await them. The overarching issue of pay discrimination is alleviated neither by adamant denial of its existence nor by oversimplifications of it, such as references to the “78 cents” statistic without offering proper context. 
Much is made of the existence of pointed gender gaps in lucrative, high-paying fields, which make for consistent pay and expansive opportunities for upward mobility. Today, jobs like this are generally in infamously male-dominated STEM fields. I am studying journalism and political science, both fields that aren’t exactly associated with lavish wealth, so I know firsthand how often young women are blamed for inflicting the wage gap upon themselves by disproportionately pursuing the humanities. 
We seldom ask ourselves about the cultural values and gender roles that steer women — but not men — from pursuing lucrative fields, nor do we consider the long history of societal devaluation of feminized lines of work, evidenced by numerous studies indicating that once male-dominated fields, from teaching to nursing, substantially lose prestige and pay quality upon gradually becoming dominated by women. As Paula England, a sociology professor at New York University, told The New York Times in their report on the devaluation of feminized work last year, once women start doing a job, “it just doesn’t look like it’s as important … or requires as much skill.”
In this sense, “progress” arguably isn’t just encouraging women to abandon their personal interests and pursue STEM, but also reconsider how we evaluate the value of work as a whole. Still, at USC, it’s worth noting and applauding how gender gaps in formerly male-dominated areas of study are beginning to close. In 2016, USA Today ranked USC as the third best college for women studying STEM, noting how the number of women in tenured faculty positions pertaining to the sciences has tripled since 2000.
However, very tellingly, a 2016 study by the Ohio State University found women with STEM-related Ph.D.s still earn about 31 percent less than men with STEM-related Ph.D.s. We can’t just write off the wage gap as the product of women purportedly hating science. Instead, we have to own up to the fact that discrimination, even if unconscious, remains prevalent and influences how employers determine who is worthy of raises and promotions. 
Young women shouldn’t hold their breaths waiting for rapid cultural progress. Now that we have the facts, it’s a matter of using them to fight for positive change. We deserve better than what seems to await us in the workplace, but we’ll have to fight for it.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
It’s no secret that the classroom, our nation’s academic journals and university research initiatives are notorious for leaning left. To have liberal stances in the worlds of academia and research is one thing, but to be bordering a liberal monopoly is another. The problem, however, lies not with ivory tower academic elites alone. Rather, conservatives and liberals share equal blame for our biased intellectual institutions. Though the fringes of the conservative movement have recently jeopardized the credibility of conservative voices, it is time for the true intellectual conservative movement to bring the message back into our academic environments. This movement must make a resurgence in academia, not only to guarantee that the Republican Party does not disappear down the rabbit hole, but also for the good of the entire country.
Yes, the Republican Party has become quite a spectacle, and not in a positive way — but there is still credibility in the core of conservative ideology. Economics departments, business schools and a myriad of other select fields have proven to be the last bastions of conservative intellectual thought in academia. The tenets of individuality and reason have lost ground in an increasingly postmodern world, but the theories and practicalities of conservatism remain clear.
The conservative movement has a strong past of credibility and influence in academic environments. A principled, albeit controversial, champion of the conservative movement, Bill Buckley was perhaps the foremost intellectual conservative. It was Buckley who was able to transform the conservative message into a testable, quantifiable and, most of all, an intellectual movement. Buckley founded a conservative editorial publication, the National Review, and helped create Young Americans for Freedom, a student group which champions conservative causes on college campuses from the turbulent 1960s to the present day. In addition, conservative professors have made great contributions to society. Milton Friedman, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, was a Nobel Prize winner. George Mason University professor Walter Williams and economist Thomas Sowell continue to be active and prominent names in academia. Writer Ayn Rand, another contentious figure who was resolute in her beliefs, brought a sense of legitimacy to the conservative movement through her novels and essays. 
It is easy to say that former President Ronald Reagan would not recognize his party anymore if he were alive today. The same could be said for Buckley, who jokingly reflected on President-elect Donald Trump’s self-promotion by stating that “if Trump were shaped a little differently, he would compete for Miss America.” The conservative movement, which has been hijacked by neo-conservatives — hawkish Republicans with socially conservative tendencies — is too busy pushing an unsustainable and altogether wacky social agenda which cannot be taken seriously amongst the American people, let alone our academic institutions. Buckley’s original editorial content has given way to inflammatory talk radio and the Rush Limbaughs of the world. Rand’s novels, consistently filled with solid tact, have given way to Ann Coulter’s grandiose publications which pander to the emotions of socially conservative Republicans.
The Republican Party has done a good job of turning its back on the value of intellectual thought. As it stands, this isolated relationship between conservatives and academia will send the movement on a quick path towards irrelevance. The helm of the Republican Party needs to return to its lifeblood. Conservatives must embrace the movement’s most useful role: teaching practical ideals to students and academics — our future leaders and policymakers. It will be up to what is left of the true conservative movement to ensure that the conservative voice continues to be an influence on the nation’s intellectual pursuits. 
The intellectual conservative movement has no room for the alt-right or neo-conservatives. The intellectual conservative movement similarly has no room to fall behind in our current academic environment. What we teach in our universities, cover in our academic journals and identify as our topics of research have a large potential to become accepted elements of our society. In this way, what we teach in our academic environments does not stay academic for long. For every Marxist sympathizer, college students should hear from a free market champion, and for every collectivist call for safe spaces, there should be equal support of individualism and Rand’s Objectivism on campus. The political views of our student body and our country are incredibly varied, and the views of our faculty and academic institutions should be just as diverse.
The author can write well but he doesn’t know anything about American political movements. Neo-Conservatism is anti-intellectual?  Do you even know what Neo-Conservatism is? They are intellectual snobs. Do you know who Irving Kristol is? Do you know who Leo Strauss is, the father of Neo-Conservatism? You shouldn’t write on things about which you are ignorant. The problem with Neo-Conservatives is that they are not pure Conservatives, not that they are anti intellectual. 
Wrong! Neo-conservatism IS intellectual conservatism!
“Wrong! Neo-conservatism IS intellectual conservatism!”
Is it?  That’s news.  How so?
What is this writer talking about, asking where the intellectual conservatives are?  It’s the alt-Left that has brought us the transgender lie, trashing science by suggesting gender is “fluid” or a state of mind!!  …and then having the audacity to tell conservatives to just deal with it?   The alt-Left brought us gay marriage, a warm and cuddly idea rooted in “inclusion”, obliterating the English language by changing gender-specific terms and demonizing gender-specific pronouns.  The alt-Left has brought us in-state tuition, driver’s licenses and so-called sanctuary city policies for people in the country illegally… literally doubling down on their efforts to protect and shield illegal immigrants.  
The writer thinks Republicans are the ones busy “pushing an unsustainable and altogether wacky social agenda” ?? WOW!!!!  Time for a total reality check folks.  The alt-Left has been peddling wacky, emotionally based ideas and agenda for decades.  I understand that Donald Trump is being painted as the face of the Republican party, having just been elected President on a Republican ticket… But everyone knows Trump is as much an “Independent” as anything.  One need only remember how he was uniformly rebuffed by fellow Republicans during the campaign (and even now).  I suspect he will please and frustrate BOTH Democrats and Republicans as he unrolls his policy agenda.  The reality is that mainstream conservativism if far “intellectual” and in touch with reality than mainstream liberalism which has led to the total rubbish described above.  The one place Republicans and conservatives should not have to defend truth, science and sensibility is a university campus, yet that is exactly where liberal nonsense has taken hold.  Re-read paragraph 1 above, and think about it.
Apparently you have never listened to Rush Limbaugh.  Suggest you actually try it before you criticize.  And your reverence for National Review leaves you suspect as not being a conservative.  They went over the line in this election.  Conservative policy is NOT the same as liberal policy (e.g. open borders, national defense as vehicle for social policy [transgenderism], government mandated health insurance [the grossly misnamed ACA]), therefore “conservatives” who cooperate with the liberals (aka the Uniparty or GOPe) are not our friends.  We don’t want the s__t sandwich.  Never did.  Want it off the menu. #MAGA
I bet there are plenty of conservative students at USC and other universities.  The problem is, should they voice their opinion that goes against popular culture, they know they will be castigated by their professors and peers.  Thus, they remain silent.  That’s too bad.

Disclaimer: this blog is not about bartending or ordering a drink. In order to understand why my column is titled “with a twist,” answer these three questions first. 
If you answered one, two, or all three questions “yes,” then you are in luck. If you answered zero questions “yes,” you are also in luck. This blog is designated to the everyday person, the overachiever, the couch potato, the extrovert, the homebody and the people that fall in line wherever they choose to. No matter who you are, where you live, or what you like to do in your spare time, there is an undeniable connection among any college student: Our days are filled with challenges. From fitness to friendship, it is important to make the best out of every possible situation. This is where I come in. I aim to give advice on how to turn everyday difficult situations into something positive. In other words, tackling challenges with a twist.
First order of business: New Year’s. I don’t believe in the phrase, “new year, new me.” Realistically, it’s pretty impossible to become a new person between Dec. 31 and January 1. Nevertheless, there is an element of worthiness in this infamous expression. Essentially, New Year’s resolutions aim to change the factors of your life that you do not like. So this year, I’m making my own motto: “new year, new decisions.” I am focusing less on becoming a “new person,” and more on altering the decisions I make in life to create positive changes in 2017. Ultimately, I realized general resolution lists are not realistic on a college campus. That is why I created my own New Year’s resolutions list with a twist.
Fitness. Let’s be honest, getting to the Lyon Center is a workout in itself. My initial resolution of “work out more!” is a joke because that is the most general resolution I have ever read. Instead, I decided to make a weekly schedule providing designated times to work out and actually do it. Whether it is hitting the weight room or trying a workout class at the Lyon Center, I promise to make the time to work out. Commitment to my workout schedule. That is my New Year’s fitness decision.
Health. To be honest with you, I’m already a healthy eater so my resolution really can’t be to “eat healthier.” However, health is not only food related. Rushing from class to class, the row to campus, and my dorms to the gym is exhausting. Some days it feels like I don’t stop. In order to maintain my emotional health at school I plan on setting time aside from my busy schedule once a day to focus on myself. Whether this is having lunch with a friend, taking a nap to get through the rest of the day, or cooking a healthy meal, I am actively deciding to slow down my days to enjoy them instead of attempting to rush through my schedule. 
There are so many more resolutions and so little time. Hopefully, this glimpse at my USC-related resolutions has inspired you to revamp your own. More importantly, I encourage you to remember this year is about you: you have the power to make positive decisions, find time for yourself and let your resolutions become your reality.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a preview of the upcoming Presidential Inauguration Tuesday night. The event featured a panel of experts who discussed what to expect from President-elect Donald Trump and the unpredictability of Trump’s actions thus far. Unruh Director Robert Shrum moderated the panel. He was joined by Lisa Korbatov, the vice president of the Beverly Hills Unified School District; Adam Nagourney, the L.A. bureau chief of The New York Times; and Dan Schwerin, Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton’s former director of speechwriting.
The panel began with a conversation about historic inaugural addresses and how they have usually been kept short and stuck to what will be the big themes of the incoming president’s administration. All three panelists emphasized that past inaugural addresses have always stuck to a unifying message for the country, a call to heal the wounds of the campaign and a sense of moving on together as one country. Schwerin expressed that even after a campaign as polarized and bitterly fought as this one, unity should be Trump’s number one message, but expressed his doubts that the President-elect would continue this tradition due to his propensity for bucking established traditions and his volatile personality.
Schwerin, unlike the other panelists, believed that Trump’s speech will emphasize unification.
“I’m hoping to hear from him a message of unity,” Schwerin said. “And I think he will deliver it.”
However, Korbatev argued that even if Trump does attempt to unify the country with his speech on Friday, the majority of the people who opposed him so bitterly in the general election will not listen. They’re still licking their wounds after such a fraught election, and to Korbav, that is to be expected. She said she believes that, Trump is not going to be talking to them anyway.
“[Trump] is not going to talk to the left — they’re not going to listen,” Korbatev said. “He’s going to talk to the middle and talk to those people who feel forgotten and left behind because they’re the reason he won the election.”
The panel also discussed Trump’s opposition, and the choice of over 50 elected Democrats boycott the Inauguration. While this boycott wasn’t the first of its kind, it was the first to garner this kind of press attention. The panel was split in its reaction to the boycott. Schwerin said that American democracy allows them the freedom to choose, while Nagourney took the side that if they chose not to go, they should not have dramatized it in the media. Korbatov called the Democrats who chose not to go “shameful” for not fulfilling their duty as elected officials.
The panel ended with the three panelists discussing whether inaugural addresses ever live up to the expectations that surround them beforehand. Schwerin claimed that inaugural addresses are rarely very good, and usually not the best speeches of a presidency, even for experienced speakers like President Barack Obama and Clinton. According to Schwerin, too many suffer from the fatal flaw of trying to capture the magic of Kennedy’s grandiose inaugural address, and they inevitably fall short. But Nagourney said that Trump’s speech is unpredictable.
“Inaugural addresses do not necessarily live up to the hype,” Nagourney said. “But who can predict what will happen with this one?”

Kevin Starr, a California historian and professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, died on Jan. 14 of a heart attack in San Francisco, Calif. He was 76.
Starr joined the USC faculty in 1989 as a professor of history and policy, planning and development.
“Professor Starr was our dear friend, a beloved teacher and a USC treasure, but he truly belonged to the world,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said, according to USC News. “His bright mind, rigorous intellect and passion for language will be deeply missed.”
Starr was known for writing the eight-volume series Americans and the California Dream, which documented the history of California, and various other books about the history of the state.
He earned his Ph.D. in English and American literature at Harvard University in 1969. He also earned a Master’s in library science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1974. 
“Kevin Starr chronicled the history of California as no one else,” Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement. “He captured the spirit of our state and brought to life the characters and personalities that made the California story.”
Starr also served as  California’s state librarian from 1994 to 2004, when then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger named him State Librarian Emeritus. Starr received the Presidential Medal from USC in 2005, and the next year, President George W. Bush awarded him the National Humanities Medal.
In 2016, Starr published Continental Ambitions: Roman Catholics in North America: the Colonial Experience, and was writing the sequel when he died, according to The New York Times.
“Kevin wrote ‘til the day he died. He was a productive and indefatigable scholar and the greatest historian of California,” said fellow USC professor Dana Gioia, according to The Orange County Register. “People who knew him held him in enormous affection because any situation was always better if he was around.”
Kevin Starr is survived by his wife, Sheila Starr; two daughters, Jessica Starr and Marian Starr Imperatore; and seven grandchildren.

Senators passed a resolution to allow easier access to information about their pass-fail courses at an Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday evening. The resolution, authored by Sen. Tyler Matheson and first presented on Jan. 10, calls for a change in the email interface sent to students to more clearly communicate which courses they are taking for grades and which courses they are taking pass-fail.
Matheson emphasized the importance of the resolution’s focus on the way pass-fail courses were previously presented to students. He said that many students had difficulty finding out how many pass-fail courses they were registered for, and the resolution aimed to streamline this information into a succinct email. 
“The goal of this resolution is to give the students more information about their pass-fail classes,” Matheson said. “It should be easier for students to see whether or not they are signed up for any pass-fail classes, and if so, how many they are signed up for.”
Some of the concerns fellow senators proposed regarded the usefulness of Matheson’s resolution. Sen. Tiffany Lian posed questions about the details and the nature of the resolution.
“Would the resolution cover changes in email and in the myUSC calendar, or would it only result in a change in the email?” Lian asked. 
Lian said that it would be more effective to add a different color code for pass-fail classes on students’ myUSC calendars as an addition to the improved e-mail interface. 
According to Matheson, however, adding a color code to students’ myUSC calendars would require an additional communication initiative with the registrar, and would make the process more tedious. As of now, Matheson said, the most effective method would be to improve the pass-fail course email design. 
Sen. Paul Samaha asked why Matheson’s initiative was in the form of a resolution as opposed to a proposal. Samaha said that resolutions tend to hold more weight in terms of urgency, which Matheson’s resolution did not seem to have.
“I believe that holding back resolutions encourages non-action in the Senate and in the administration,” Matheson said in response. “So making this plan a resolution instead of a proposal allows it to sit on the administration’s desk with more weight, which I think it deserves given that it is an important issue.” 
Matheson’s resolution passed with nine for and three against. 
After passing the resolution, Senators proposed ideas to decrease bike-related accidents while allowing commuters to travel from their residences to school efficiently. USG Vice President Austin Dunn proposed making Trousdale Parkway a bike-free zone and redirecting passing bikes to follow a path around the perimeter of campus. 
When the meeting adjourned, the bike discussion was still in an initial phase, but Dunn said that the University administration would continue to coordinate with the USC Bicycle Coalition to develop an effective and feasible plan to decrease bike-related accidents while allowing students to commute. 
“What we know for sure is that we won’t be completely banning bikes on campus,” Dunn said. “But there definitely will be a drastic decrease in bike traffic, which will improve student safety and wellbeing.”

Assistant Professor Sarah Portnoy hosted an event on Tuesday to celebrate her new book, Food, Health, and Culture in Latino Los Angeles. The book highlights the rich history of Latino cuisine in Los Angeles, the contemporary Latino food scene and the various struggles for food justice the Latino community faces, especially in South Los Angeles.
Only 200 miles from the Mexican border, Los Angeles has the largest Latino population in the United States. Portnoy, however, explained that this isn’t the only Latino influence in Los Angeles. Immigrants from Central and South America have made their mark on the city, and because of this, Latino food has skyrocketed in popularity.
“Latino cuisine in Los Angeles is more interesting and innovative than ever,” Portnoy said. “Mexican food is by far one of the most popular, complex and widely available cuisines, but Southern Californians are also branching out and exploring cuisines from Peru, Argentina, El Salvador and beyond, as well as Mexican-influenced fusion flavors that range from sushi burritos to kimchi quesadillas.”
Portnoy said that despite the popularity of Latino cuisine and chefs, there continues to be a divide between the quality and healthiness of food available at restaurants and food trucks and what is available in food deserts like South Los Angeles, which is home to many low-income and urban Latinos. According to Portnoy, in South Los Angeles, grocery stores only make up two percent of all food options causing the majority of the population to turn to unhealthy and fast food alternatives. This has led to 70 percent of adult Latinos and 35 percent of children in some communities to become obese. 
Several community-based organizations in attendance explained the difficulties in accessing healthier options and their efforts to combat the lack of healthy food, diabetes and obesity by establishing community gardens and programs.
Kathryn Kocarnik, co-director of Garden School Foundation, an interdisciplinary program of education that teaches garden-based learning at elementary schools, explained that children love their communities, learning about healthy eating and creating their own urban gardens.
“A lot of our students don’t have access to land where they can get their hands dirty,” Kocarnik said. “The kids talk about coming into the garden, and they talk about wanting to come to school because they can go into the garden.”
Similarly, directors at community-oriented organizations Groceryships and With Love Market and Cafe explained the astounding impacts that health education has on the low-income Latino population.
“The heart of our program is a 20-week model, teaching about not just nutrition but building community around healthy lifestyles,” Dana Rizer of Groceryships said. “Based on this understanding that health is not just physical, health is emotional, health is mental. A lot of the decisions we make about food come from very emotional places. They also come from very real economic places. So, it doesn’t really work to teach people that eating more vegetables is the healthy thing to do. We have to integrate it with the cultures that we’re working with.”
Karla Vasquez, director of community programs at With Love Market and Cafe explained the goals of their community project.
“We’re here to provide opportunities for our neighborhood and our community to be healthy in as many ways as possible,” Vasquez said. “We do host community cooking classes. We do have a free yoga class Mondays at 6 p.m. But, we also make an effort to create opportunities for creative outlets like open mics so individuals can share what’s on their hearts. These outlets make a real big difference. It’s empowering a community.”
Food justice is real. As one who has lived in LA, Oakland and Sacramento – if you’re in the wrong zip code, you’re gonna have to travel a bit to a real grocery store. I love what Governor Brown was doing in Oakland as mayor helping to build affordable urban housing with REAL grocery stores within those developments. #Healthylatinos.

Maggie Lee | Daily Trojan
So it’s happening.
Junior receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson are officially hanging up their helmets as Trojans. Next season, we won’t hold our breath as the ball hangs in the air during every kickoff, and we won’t join in with mid-game dance sessions as the stadium speakers blare “JuJu On That Beat.”
It’s been a tough transition, as the afterglow of the Rose Bowl wore off with every NFL declaration and senior goodbye. And as I fondly reminisce over the last few years worth of mind boggling catches and kick return dashes, I can’t help but wonder what USC football is going to look like without our dynamic duo.
I’m a sophomore who grew up in Kansas, far from the shiny allure and storied tradition of USC football. I didn’t grow up singing the Fight Song or wearing cardinal and gold, and even now as a sports editor I’m constantly embarrassed by my lack of knowledge about former head coach Lane Kiffin or quarterback Matt Leinart.
When I came to Los Angeles two years ago, I sustained a very quick, very rushed history of Trojan history. It was characterized by an overarching hatred of UCLA, hallowed with championships and punctuated by names like linebacker Junior Seau and former head coach Pete Carroll. But more than anything or anyone else, JuJu and Adoree’ have defined my short-lived run as a USC fan. 
They did it with style, with heart, creating the type of excitable buzz that every student section requires to stay on its feet and roaring throughout the blaring heat of early autumn in Los Angeles. 
The first time I heard the name Adoree’ Jackson and remembered it, he had just dodged nine — perhaps 10 — Arkansas State defenders in the season opener of my freshman year. The play only gained him 20 yards, but it felt like he was running forever, bobbing and weaving, doing whatever he needed to stay on his feet for another second.
I had just enough time to wonder who the heck that was before the loudspeakers announced his name, the sound booming through the Coliseum. It wasn’t the type of name you forget.
JuJu played with that same eye-catching style, the kind that made it impossible to forget his presence. He played through a broken hand, an injured hip, a bad back. He threw blocks that sent opponents flying. He goaded defensive backs into tackling him just to toss them the opposite direction with a stiff arm. 
There was a reason we loved them so much. Statistically, there’s a lot to say about the two players — together they led the team in scoring, receptions, rushing, kick returns, interceptions, fumble returns. They set records, won awards and made headlines on a weekly basis. But as much as it might seem to be on paper, those stats aren’t the reasons that we loved them so much.
We don’t watch sports simply to see teams make precise marches into each other’s endzones. We watch them for a show, for entertainment, and JuJu and Adoree’ were nothing if not entertaining. Each week, each kick return, each pass, it seemed we were all thinking the same question — what are these guys going to do next?
A huge factor of the popularity of any college athlete rests in the way they live their lives every day. Just ask any Florida State or Oklahoma fan — it’s hard to cheer for your star when he loses his shine off the field.
This is even more true for college stars than it is for the pros. Professional athletes can hide away from the rest of us, retreating to their unattainable lifestyles to remain removed from the average fan. But college athletes stay in the same dorms, eat in the same dining halls and take the same classes as the rest of the average USC population.
That means that the spotlight follows them wherever they go. It’s not an easy job keeping that image up, but it’s something JuJu and Adoree’ somehow maintained throughout their three years as Trojans. 
They were humble, straightforward and sometimes downright hilarious in interviews. They roasted each other for being “ugly” on Twitter and turned back flips during practice. Most importantly, they bought into that idea — the Trojan family — that we’re so proud of, and they stuck with it until the end. 
It’s pretty easy to tell when a player is well-loved by the USC student section. Their names are painted onto the stomachs of the front row of the Trojan Knights. Their numbers are emblazoned on the jerseys filling the stands and roars of “one more year” fill the stands when they take the field.
We loved JuJu and Adoree’ because of how they played, and we’ll remember them for that, too. But more importantly, we’ll remember and miss them for the way they took the field each week, representing our school in the best light, giving us all something to feel proud about.
The Rose Bowl proved to us that we’ll be okay without them, especially in the hands of head coach Clay Helton and redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold. But there will always be something missing, and that’s not a bad thing. That’s what a legacy looks like — a lasting impression, the type that makes fans miss a player long after they’ve moved onto bigger and better things.
I’ve been a USC fan for two years now, and I still have a lot to learn. But I think I’ve seen enough to know this — JuJu and Adoree’ may be leaving after this year, but their legacies will remain for much, much longer.

As Martin Luther King Jr. Day approached last weekend, USC football fans felt an increasing sense of optimism about the status of junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. Jackson began attending classes for the spring semester and was regularly seen on campus and in the USC athletic facilities over the past week. The lack of chatter about a draft decision soothed many into believing that Jackson would be returning to the football team for his senior season in 2017.
However, on Monday — the final day for eligible players to declare for the NFL Draft — Jackson announced via social media that he would be forgoing his senior season to enter the 2017 NFL Draft. Jackson’s announcement included an open letter addressed to the Trojan  Family regarding his decision. 
Jackson, a unanimous All-American in 2016, declared for the draft after a junior season in which he won the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation’s top defensive back and helped lead USC to its first Rose Bowl victory since 2009. 
With his decision, Jackson joins junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and junior guard Damien Mama as one of three Trojans who will be forgoing their senior season to enter the draft in April. 
“Thank you to the Trojan Family for embracing me and my family the way you guys did! Being a Trojan was the best time of my life and I’ll never ever forget my time here at USC,” Jackson said. “I hope you continue to support me throughout the rest of my career.”
A triple threat for the Trojans, Jackson was the ultimate Swiss army knife during his collegiate career. In addition to reeling in five interceptions during his Thorpe Award-winning junior season with USC, Jackson finished his Trojan football career with 39 receptions for 628 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns. 
Over his career, Jackson established himself as arguably the top kick returner in USC football history. In 2016, Jackson was the only player in the nation to return multiple kickoffs and punts for touchdowns; he took two punts and two kickoffs to the house for a total of four return touchdowns his junior year, and he finished with eight in his collegiate career. 
Jackson leaves USC with the all-time record in kickoff return yardage (2,141 yards). 
His football portfolio at USC is flooded with iconic moments, all of which contributed to turning the Trojans back into a nationally relevant football program. 
USC’s run to a Rose Bowl Trophy was sparked by a plethora of big plays from Jackson. His interception on Oct. 8 against then-No. 21 Colorado is one that will live in highlight reels forever. He picked a pass from Colorado quarterback Steven Montez almost completely out of bounds, but then inexplicably found a way to spread his legs in mid-air to get a foot in-bounds for the interception. The play built up acclaim for Jackson and earned him hype for the Thorpe Award he would eventually win. 
His two-interception effort against No. 4 Washington on Nov. 12 helped propel USC to its biggest win of the regular season and get the Trojans back in the national spotlight. 
While Jackson’s football resume is extensive, perhaps the greatest exhibition of his dynamic abilities came against Notre Dame on Nov. 26. 
Against the Fighting Irish, Jackson scored a total of three touchdowns in three different ways: He had a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, a 55-yard punt return for a touchdown and a 52-yard touchdown reception. 
Jackson’s final performance in the Coliseum may have been his most impressive, as the Trojans defeated Notre Dame, 45-27, in the season-finale rivalry game. 
From his first game at the Coliseum in September 2014 against Fresno State, in which he caught a touchdown as a true freshman, to his heroic finale against the Irish, Jackson gave Trojan fans memorable plays on a regular basis. 
And when Jackson wasn’t cementing himself into Trojan football lore, he almost casually built up a winning legacy as a track and field athlete for USC. Jackson was the Pac-12 champion in long jump in 2015 and 2016. He missed football spring practices in 2016 as he attempted to qualify for the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team to compete in Rio as a long jumper. 
But beyond the innumerable merits, the All-Pac-12 honors, the remarkable interceptions and even the Thorpe Award, Jackson cherished one accolade above all during his time as a Trojan: bringing the Rose Bowl Trophy back to Heritage Hall.
“It’s been an incredible three years playing for one of the great traditions in college football,” Jackson wrote about his collegiate career. “I made the best decision of my life when I chose to come to USC, and finishing it off with a Rose Bowl win is one of the best ways I could have ever hoped for it to end.”
