When Alyssa Matias stopped her car at the crosswalk at Jefferson and Hoover, she did not expect to see an overpacked Rock and Reilly’s serving students in the middle of the afternoon with no masks in sight. Driving a bit past the bar where crosswalk signs from USC read “United We Stop COVID,” she saw groups of students walking toward USC Village, with many disregarding mask mandates. 
Matias, a sophomore majoring in political science, is set to move into her USC Housing assignment in Cowlings and Ilium Residential College this week. But from her experience visiting campus for her on-campus job and driving near the area, she said she has witnessed students disregarding health and safety guidelines during the pandemic. 
Between Aug. 15 and Aug. 29, the coronavirus positivity rate among students rose from 3.6% to 27.5%, according to a Student Health update Tuesday. Between Aug. 24 and Aug. 27 alone, 104 students tested positive for COVID-19, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a media briefing last Thursday, and case numbers have only risen since then. While some students have shirked the risk and continued to host and attend parties and gatherings around the campus area, others have taken to social media to call out their peers for acting selfish and ignoring safety measures. 
Matias has been frustrated seeing some students continue to break public health guidelines when other students and community members are acting in the best interest of their family, friends and everyone around them.
“You can definitely tell when you get on campus who’s taking it seriously and who is not,” Matias said. “But the sad part to me is that this virus disproportionately affects certain groups of people and those people aren’t the ones partying or having gatherings during COVID.”
Origins of community spread
At housing complexes like University Gateway, student gatherings and parties have been taking place since students moved in. In a Reddit post Aug. 16, a gathering with more than 50 residents went viral, with various other pictures and posts shared online of other instances of large social gatherings taking place at the complex. At The Lorenzo Apartments, a “Quarantine Balcony Party” was put together by the property’s management Aug. 21 in which the invitation to residents cited a capacity of 45 people. 
Julia McGowan, a sophomore majoring in theatre, witnessed large gatherings of more than 30 residents taking place three times since she moved into Gateway mid-August. As she and her roommate were making their way to the laundry room through Gateway’s outside hallways one day, she said they saw another large gathering where most of the residents were not wearing masks. When McGowan decided to take photos of the students to post on Snapchat, one of them yelled “Take a video, it’ll last longer.” 
In an email to residents Aug. 24, Gateway issued mandatory mask wearing in all common areas, including the courtyard, garage, hallways and rooftop decks — a mandate building staff said would be “closely monitored.” Elevators would also be restricted to one household per ride and no more than four people at a time. The email did not say what repercussions residents who don’t comply would face.
Despite the guidance, McGowan said not all students wear masks throughout the complex. Getting on an empty elevator, around eight residents hopped on at the next floor, with only three wearing masks, she said. 
“If they’re spreading COVID and they touch a surface, that affects us,” McGowan said. “‘Do what you want to do until it affects me’ — I feel like that’s a philosophy that people stand by but at the end of the day it could affect you way quicker than you realize when you’re in tight living quarters.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas said he has met with management at Gateway regarding the large gatherings taking place and is working with the staff to help the University and the city hold students accountable. 
Gateway and the Lorenzo Apartments did not respond to requests for comment.
However, small and large student gatherings have also been taking place in houses off campus, including on 28th Street, which is home to more than 23 fraternity and sorority houses. Over the summer, 45 positive cases of the coronavirus were connected to fraternities at the Row.
Andrew Hulin, a senior in the Iovine and Young Academy, has only hung out with his roommates and friends living in a neighboring apartment on Menlo Avenue since moving back to USC. Through his window, he has regularly seen students play beer pong in their yards or host parties without masks or social distancing. 
On Aug. 27, Hulin posted a photo of more than 10 students playing beer pong on a lawn. He said that he took the photo the day before classes began and posted it to call attention to the type of gathering that could lead to a rise in cases. 
Many of his peers, Hulin said, have no regard for the community that surrounds USC’s campus. Rather than follow safety guidelines meant to protect everyone, he said they put South Central residents in danger every time they party while still frequenting businesses and restaurants in the area. 
“When you just look out at the street and see everyone [on] North Campus throwing these parties just so wild, out in the open,” he said. “It’s just like, I don’t know, it makes you want to shake them, like ‘Why can’t you see how close we are to the rest of L.A.?’” 
However, large gatherings are not the only cause of coronavirus spread. In a communitywide email Aug. 24, Van Orman wrote that “every interaction where you share close contact or remove your face covering, can pose a risk to yourself and your friends” including small gatherings. If there is one person at the gathering that has contracted the virus, each participant, especially if in close proximity, is at risk of exposure and spread.
Sophomore Grace Oh, who is majoring in business administration, said she has been exposed to three people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. She said that she would hang out with various small groups of friends and would try to wear a mask most of the time, but ended up socializing directly with at least 13 people beyond her roommates. 
“Here’s what I’m going to do going forward … number one, no more hugging people. I’m going to try to make sure most of the time I’m outside,” Oh said. “Just being more mindful about wearing a mask and being proactive about who I’m seeing.”
McGowan, who also attended a small gathering but said she regretted attending as soon as she arrived, said the issue is moreso with students who have continued to participate in large gatherings. 
“People will make mistakes,” McGowan said. “It’s more of the fact that the people that have been out there at Gateway have shown no remorse for it … it’s not just like a mistake of ‘OK, we just got back to school, we did something stupid, we’ve learned our lesson, we’re not doing it again’ because it’s continuous and consistent.”
Since the start of the safer-at-home orders from Los Angeles County and California, Cherise Cayetano, who has a weakened immune system, has only left her house when absolutely necessary. Since the start of the pandemic, Cayetano has only visited campus once and hasn’t ventured to USC Village since the start of the semester because she doesn’t want to increase her risk of contracting the virus. 
Although she has barely stepped out of her house, Cayetano is frustrated by posts on Twitter and Instagram showing students at large gatherings.
“What do you gain from this? Is it that important that you literally need to be crowding up a safe space for people,” said Cayetano, a senior majoring in law, history and culture. “What do you gain from potentially risking the lives of all the people around you? I genuinely don’t understand.”
Lack of disciplinary action
Before living in her current housing arrangement, Cayetano resided in Parkside Apartments, where she appealed to stay after the University transitioned to online classes in March. Citing to USC Housing her weakened immune system and the fact that her parents were older and at risk of contracting the virus, Cayetano was first denied her request. It was only after another housing representative looked at her file that Cayetano was able to stay. With cases rising among students, Cayetano sees a similar scenario unfolding this semester, with the University asking students to leave their on-campus housing arrangements. 
Cayetano continued to face issues with housing over the summer, when the University first announced a hybrid model for classes in June and then pulled back on that plan in July, after Cayetano and many other students had paid rent on their off-campus leases. 
“They should have never sent that email to make us think that we were coming back when they didn’t even get the OK from … L.A. County,” Cayetano said. “Students that are out of state, so many low income, first-generation students, there are so many resources that so many people just don’t have, and my worst fear is that USC is just going to say ‘Well, pack it up and go home’ when some people may not even have a home to go back to or the money to get home.”
Rachel Sanchez, a junior majoring in sociology, said she reported a lawn party with more than 20 students to DPS Aug. 22. Officers arrived at the scene, but she said she doesn’t know what happened to the students as a result of breaking safety guidelines. Sanchez, who has also reported infractions online, said she wishes the University would be more transparent about the consequences students are facing. 
“It makes me very upset and sad to see [students] not only putting themselves in danger but putting the greater community at risk,” Sanchez said. “USC students who are not from South Central Los Angeles, we are guests in a community, and by breaking social distancing rules, by not wearing masks, by partying, by just being around people who aren’t in your direct social bubble or apartment, house — wherever you live — to me I feel like that’s sending a message to the community that we are occupying that says we don’t actually care about you.”
According to DPS crime logs, 14 parties that have been shut down were classified as “Loud and Raucous Noise,” since Aug. 14, in addition to one noncriminal incident report that cited many people disregarding social distancing protocols. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Thomas said that although DPS does not have jurisdiction to take action against gatherings occurring inside housing complexes, the city attorney indicated to the department that in cases of “chronic or repetitive” gatherings taking place, students will be held accountable via Section 8.77 and 8.78 of the L.A. administrative code. Property managers may also be cited under this offense. 
However, citations against these gatherings have not been issued, Thomas said. 
Matias believes that labeling large gatherings and parties as noise complaints acts as a “coverup” to the real reason parties are being shut down. She also said that if the gatherings were being held by Black and Latinx students, DPS officers would not have issues with shutting those parties down or issuing disciplinary action. 
“There have been parties pre-COVID where … there would be a party of mostly white students and then across the street there’s a party with mostly Black and Latinx students. Immediately, the party with people of color gets shut down and then the other one is fine,” Matias said. “I feel like there’s a double standard when it comes to shutting down COVID gatherings too. I can’t help [but] think that if there were these gatherings with minority students, they would also be shut down and, those consequences that the University is talking about, I feel as though they would be actually practiced because we haven’t seen any of that so far.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp said a handful of students who hosted parties have been threatened with the potential loss of TrojanCheck, their pass to enter campus, or suspension, but students are in the process of appealing the disciplinary actions. 
While a committee that includes the Office of Student Affairs and DPS has been formed to determine action against students, Crisp said it’s impossible to punish every student who attends a party. The group’s main goal, he said, is to enforce safety guidelines and warn students who gather in groups and don’t social distance or wear masks. 
“I don’t want to give people the impression that somehow we either have the capability or the ability to chase down every student who goes to a party, even if they know they’re not supposed to, and bring discipline against them,” Crisp said. “We’re not trying to set up or create sort of a, a Big Brother or sort of a, you know, type of environment, but we need people to take the public health emergency very seriously. ”
Still, if the committee determines the hosts of a party or a residence is found to consistently host gatherings, Crisp said students can be held accountable, and members of the committee will continue to meet with landlords, property owners and USC Village restaurants and stores to ensure standards are communicated. 
Crisp emphasized that contact tracing efforts from Student Health are separate from his committee’s efforts to warn and discipline consistent rulebreakers. While Student Health and the committee may look into the same incident, he said Student Health officials will never share details like names or causes of outbreaks with Student Affairs when doing contact tracing. Still, Crisp said if the source of a cluster is found to be a party, the committee may try to find the hosts to meet with them and discuss rules and standards.
“I do want to be crystal clear that the information that they collect in response to symptomology outbreaks, clustering … is not shared with and is not used in any kind of disciplinary process and it won’t be,” Crisp said. “Now let me be clear, if in the process of that we found out that is a cluster and all of the people in the cluster appeared, and we can trace it back and it appears to be able to be traced back to a party, we may be trying to talk to the folks who hosted that party about where did this come from and so on and so forth so that we can ensure that we don’t have repeated instances.”
Andrew Kinoshita, a junior majoring in health and human sciences, said he believes the disciplinary action outlined in USC’s emails has kept students from participating in Student Health’s contact tracing program out of fear of suspension or expulsion. He outlined that USC should enlist a cohesive message to encourage students to get tested without fear of repercussions.
“I do empathize with the fact that a lot of students who are following instructions would like to see the students punished,” Kinoshita said. “But the issue is that for those of us who are actually in the neighborhood, as much as it seems fair to punish the students who are breaking these guidelines, they’re going to be breaking the guidelines regardless of whether they’re punished or not. The only thing we can hope for at this point is that contact tracing works so that the students in the neighborhood who are following instruction are warned in time.”
Matias believes there should be a specific outline of University procedures that will be taken when students break safety guidelines, so they understand the consequences of their actions. Considering that the virus disproportionately affects marginalized people and South Central predominantly comprises Black and Indigenous people and people of color, she said USC should be more adamant about reprimanding students who break social distancing mandates to protect the community in which they reside. 
South Central endangered 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, inequities in health care have placed racial and ethinic minority groups at an increased risk of contracting and dying from the virus. In a study conducted by National Public Radio of data collected by 48 states and Washington D.C., 50% of cases and 90% of deaths have been from communities of color. 
Considering DPS’s presence in the neighborhood that surrounds USC, Matias also said the same action should be issued to prevent student parties.
“USC has the authority [to take disciplinary action] because they’ve never been afraid to express that authority, especially with DPS,” Matias said. “In the past, DPS hasn’t been afraid to question people that actually live in the neighborhood or express their authority onto patrons of the neighborhood. I don’t feel like [USC] should be shy during this time when this type of authority is needed. I feel like now more than ever, they should be using their authority for good and that’s breaking up parties, reporting these parties as gatherings, endangerments to the community because that’s what they really are.” 
Cayetano, whose home is near campus where her mother resides, said the University should expel students who can be identified in photos engaging in gatherings to ensure the safety of students who are following social distancing guidelines and to the surrounding South Central community. 
“There’s always this running gag that USC actually stands for the ‘University of South Central,’ and I think USC needs to realize that because that’s where it is,” Cayetano said. “I think it needs to start giving its money back to the community that it gates itself from, especially since it’s already taken so much.”
Cayetano illustrated that common spaces shared by both South Central residents and students, such as grocery stores, could pose health risks to the multigenerational families in the area due to the increased community spread among students housed off campus.
“So many people are afraid to go to the store in their own backyard,” Cayetano said. “Say there’s someone who says ‘OK, I’ll take one for the team and I’ll run to Ralphs or Trader Joe’s for us.’ But then they touch the wrong things, they forget to wash their hands, next thing you know the whole family has COVID. It doesn’t make sense in my head that people can’t visualize these things happening or these things that have happened. It baffles me, this complete disregard of life that people have for others.”
Cayetano said USC should also be providing resources to South Central residents, such as free coronavirus testing, especially if it continues to take limited action against students endangering the community.
Cayetano, who was initially questioned by friends for not leaving her apartment in March and who now can’t imagine entering a public space without wearing a mask, said she is baffled by predominantly white, privileged students who continue to disregard the severity of the pandemic. Although these students, if they ever contracted the virus after engaging in social gatherings, will be able to pay for treatment — with hospitalization for uninsured patients at an average of $73,300 according to FAIR Health — low income students cannot risk it, she said. 
“If you can’t understand the gravity of the situation, stay at home,” Cayetano said. “Because what’s the point of you risking someone else’s life all for your ignorance. So many people complain, ‘What do we do then, I just want to be able to eat out again.’ OK, so do I, but I’d rather us all stay calm and we ride this wave together so it’s over, and then we can all be back to as normal as possible.”

I saw that. You just clicked the link to read a review after you watched the movie. Did you want to see what the great film critic of the day thought, or did you miss something while watching and are now scrambling to find an explanation? (The Scholar’s Stone floats because it is fake and hollow, it’s a metaphor.)
I’ve done this on several occasions, so this isn’t an attempt to shame. But why is the knee-jerk reaction after watching something to look to those we deem “greater” than ourselves or with opinions more “viable” for an answer?
It’s great that there are myriad sources to discuss, debate or illuminate the themes and topics of films, and the internet and proliferation of streaming services are partly to credit. But when superiority complexes lend themselves to debates on if a film is good or bad, these services use this debate to their advantage. 
Now I’m not saying that friendly discussions between peers should be banished because they are major media corporations’ tools, at least not in this column. These talks are simply a microcosm of a larger issue: What films get included or left out of the canon of “really great films” should not be because of the few’s opinions, of the elite, of these companies. 
One thing that I’ve seen following me over my shoulder in my time as a film student at the sunny School of Cinematic Arts is the looming declaration: “This is what you should be watching if you want any sort of credibility as a film lover.” Beyond the canon’s roots in majority-white academia and Hollywood pats-on-the-back (which niche streaming services like Criterion and schools like USC do little to address), it often leaves people discouraged and confused after being told to invest their time in something that is simply unapproachable or not for them. 
Maybe this is the time to introduce the column. I’m Lauren, I’m a cinema and media studies senior and I’m going to use this to try to challenge you (and myself) as to where film culture and study should be situated, and how that’s going to shape history and the business of entertainment to come.
Now that that’s out of the way, the increased accessibility to films and television is a double-edged sword, a battle in which the gatekeepers of “great cinema” are steadily losing and the general public seems to gain a greater edge.
OK sure, but what is good? What films are worth remembering? And who gets to decide this? I’ll start with the last one by telling you to look at yourself. By being part of the discussion surrounding film and media, the public has an even greater sway over what stays relevant. Have you seen that meme of the two-photo collage that features a group of men fighting with the caption “Discussing ‘Twilight’ in 2009,” and then a round-table meeting, seemingly serious in nature with the caption: “Discussing ‘Twilight’ in 2019”? 
It may seem silly, but that in itself is a reflection of the continued conversations that were being had about the movie, including how it shaped the process of adaptation, young adult culture and laid some of the foundations for leading actors Kristin Stewart and Robert Pattinson to build their “reputable” indie careers off of. And despite its abysmal 49% Rotten Tomatoes and 56 Metascore ratings, the general public ate it up — to put it in numbers, it made $408.4 million worldwide at the box office on a $37 million budget. 
The reverse sort of cultural evaluation can lead to intense scrutiny as well. When Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” was continuing its Oscar campaign, a certain scene at the pinnacle of the two main characters’ divorce proceedings brought with it a bout of intrusive thoughts (see Hunter Harris’ “This One ‘Marriage Story’ Line Plays on a Loop in My Head”) and memes that lead to warring camps discussing the film’s goodness and badness. For better or for worse, the scene was used to analyze other texts, including the true identity of Baby Yoda. Either way, the film had its moment on Twitter and other social media sites for quite a while, though it might not have been the sort of spotlight the director or critics lauding the film agreed with. 
These are just some examples of the fluidity of opinion about film that the general public can raise at its leisure. With the right audience and platform, you might not find the definitive consensus on whether these movies are good or bad. Still, the value of people’s opinions is much more democratized. And streaming and media giants take notice with their PR and social media strategies, especially the increasingly corny Netflix Twitter account. 
Remember when I used the word microcosm? Well, speaking of streaming services, part of their development and distribution strategies hinge on the ability to generate these sorts of conversations. Film Twitter will eat up indie darlings right out of festivals’ hands — for the most part — and these services will take what’s most promising and offer distribution deals worth tens of millions of dollars. 
On the flip side, they will approach a filmmaker that had critical but maybe not as far-reaching mainstream success as possible — take, for example, Dee Rees’ journey from “Pariah” to “Mudbound” — and pour their heart (if they have one) and money into these future projects because they see dollar signs come with critical acclaim and runs through the award circuit.     
But with distribution models shifting from solely theatrical releases to completely streamed or hybrid releases, the answer to what gets included in the canon of great film (and this includes great bad movies as well!) lies in its own purpose — what we can remember about the film and how that is a reflection of our culture. While streaming giants are encroaching more and more on the discussion of what stories get to be told and what don’t, the increased accessibility to programming puts the power in the viewer’s hands. The films that are celebrated because they are accurate, far-ranging and impactful may or may not float to the top. Still, now more than ever, the average viewer (that’s you!) can guide film culture to what is truly remarkable and worth celebrating or push what isn’t to sink.

Glam, glitter and bold lashes — since the first moment makeup artist and photographer Avery Davis laid eyes on the dramatic painted faces and elongated winged eyeliner integral to drag queen makeup, they have always been attracted to a bold and colorful aesthetic. From both their professional work and personal creative endeavors on YouTube and Instagram, Davis is an icon on campus known for their dark and beautiful works of art, be it through makeup or photography.
A senior majoring in cinema and media studies, Davis serves and centers bold and daring looks on their Instagram, @stayservinglooks. Davis grew up in Compton and has been practicing makeup for about six years. Like many aspiring makeup artists, their journey began out of simple curiosity coupled with the need for a creative outlet to balance the stress of school and express their sense of identity. 
Discovering popular beauty gurus on YouTube to learn skills and find inspiration helped Davis gain increasing confidence in their makeup looks. They later decided to dive into the field of photography to capture and share the beauty of their makeup artistry. Branching off into photography inspired Davis to practice professionally and help others in the creative process of sharing their art.
In the beginning stages of their makeup journey, Davis said that their favorite beauty influencer was Michelle Phan, a pioneer of the YouTube beauty community, who arguably invented the concept of a beauty guru. Some of their favorite content creators on the YouTube platform include Jackie Aina and Miles Jai, both of whom are YouTubers who produce videos, such as wig reviews and foundation range tests, that cater specifically to the Black community’s experience in beauty. 
Gaining rising popularity on their YouTube channel, Davis also eagerly shares their enthusiasm for makeup artistry online through storytimes and “Get Ready With Me” style videos. One of Davis’ goals as an influencer is to be an active role model, encouraging others to disregard hateful opinions and freely express themselves.
When Davis first began delving into makeup, Davis’ family and friends were greatly supportive of their interest in the art form and their self-starter attitude.
 “It was easier for my family to support me because like all of the makeup I had, I bought myself,” Davis said. 
Their online presence on Instagram and YouTube has also been met with positive engagement, and  Davis hopes to grow their following to be an inspiration for more makeup enthusiasts. 
“I don’t have an audience yet, and [it’s] just people commenting so that’s nice,” Davis said. 
Davis’ self-confidence has allowed them to pursue bold and transformative looks, featuring dramatic eyelashes, reflective glitter and colorful rhinestones. Some of these looks include drag and pride makeup, and tutorials for them can be found on Davis’ YouTube channel. Davis said they are interested in pursuing YouTube as a career if it takes off in the future, but as of now, they use it as a creative outlet to share their passion for makeup and explore content creation. Described by USC alumna Kenya Aliyah, a close friend of Davis, their YouTube videos are almost like ASMR. 
“It makes you want to watch more,” Aliyah said. “[Seeing them] painting their face in the best way possible makes you want to sit down with a cup of coffee and watch them do their work.” 
Despite the familial support and online encouragement of their 1,501 followers on Instagram, Davis has also encountered some negativity along the way, but it has failed to faze them.
 “I did experience having some people who would make unnecessary comments when I was in high school, but also, I didn’t really care, so I was like, ‘Oh, OK,’” Davis said. “But I was also reaching a place where I … stopped listening and caring about what other people think.” 
When creating looks, Davis normally waits for some inspiration or chooses to highlight a certain facial feature such as a cut crease eyeshadow look or a glossy lip.
“Sometimes I’ll be like, ‘I want something really smoky,’ or ‘I want the base makeup and face to look really shiny,’ and just go off of that,” Davis said. “But  I don’t have a set goal or look in mind.” 
One of Davis’ favorite looks is more avant garde. 
“I have no brows, and it’s more of a blue look. And I just really like that one because I think my eyeliner looked really good that day,” Davis said, laughing. 
Aliyah, who has modeled for Davis several times, described the photoshoot process as very professional, yet fun and collaborative. Though Aliyah was new to modeling when she worked with Davis for the first time, they shared creative freedom in order for Davis’ characteristic dark and beautiful aesthetic to shine through.
“I feel like the beauty of the muse and the photograph [always shines in] every photo I see,” Aliyah said. “I feel like you can really see the person and there’s always like a story behind it.” 
USC alumna Ryan Evins has also worked with Davis on album art for her music career and is eager to keep working with them in the future. 
“Most times I’ll let them take creative freedom because I really trust their judgment,” Evins said. “All issues always come out really amazing, so I plan to just let them do their thing and like come up with their own ideas, because it never fails, honestly.”
As a professional, one of Davis’ most memorable jobs was doing makeup for UMI for her music video, “High School,” released in 2019. For those interested in hiring Davis for freelance makeup and photography work, Davis said they are flexible with monetizing their creativity, prioritizing the art form itself. 
Their makeup rates range from $45 to $60, totaling $80 to $100 if a photoshoot is included, Davis said.
For aspiring makeup artists and beginner photographers, Davis recommends checking out YouTube. 
“There are a lot of really helpful resources on there for learning the basics of filming and editing. Every time I’m not too sure about something, I just look up a YouTube tutorial, and those definitely help out a lot,” Davis said. “For makeup, I’d say you’ve just got to practice a lot. So I would literally just do makeup at like 3 in the morning.” 
A future project Davis has in mind is with USC alumna Tiah Giná in a futuristic Afro-centric photoshoot. According to Giná, Davis’ strong suit is their expressiveness and boldness with painting colors and shapes on the face. 
“[Davis’ aesthetic] is bold and colorful and has a message behind it — something that you’ve never seen before,” Giná said. “[There’s an] idea and thought behind it, like [each photo] based on the persona that they’re trying to recreate. They love glam, they love lashes, they love glitter, so they’re very expressive.”
When Davis is not experimenting and creating different makeup looks or working on photography, they can be found writing in their journal, filming videos or participating in student organizations, like the Black Student Assembly’s Creative Experience, all of which are key passions in their life.
“I have a couple goals. One of them would be to almost be on the same level as Pat McGrath [self-made billionare], where it’s like I’m able to participate in runway makeup,” they said. “And even just having a makeup look get published by a really highly established publication … or to just be published in a Hollywood publication — that would be really nice.”

As coronavirus outbreaks have prompted a standardized testing slowdown, hundreds of colleges and universities have suspended their test score requirements. This test-optional movement is more than just pandemic-related pragmatism: Over the last decade, it has rapidly gained acceptance by prestigious universities, such as the University of Chicago and the University of California system. In fact, a judge ruled yesterday that the University of California must suspend its testing requirement for admissions and scholarships.
While USC has already waived testing requirements for the Class of 2025, it is time to move toward a permanent test-optional policy.
As the University strives to welcome Trojans of all races and backgrounds, it ought to reckon with the racist and elitist roots of standardized testing in America. The SAT, created by known eugenicist Carl Brigham, was created to argue that people of color were responsible for the deterioration of American intelligence. Admissions test expert Jay Rosner writes that even in the late 1990s, SAT designers chose test questions based on whether more white students than Black students answered them correctly.
While it may be wrong to evaluate an initiative solely by its origins, it is equally wrong to ignore the glaring racial achievement gap in SAT and ACT scores. For SAT combined mean scores between 2007 and 2019, white and Asian American students averaged in the 1000s, while Black and Latinx students averaged in the low 900s. For ACT composite scores between 2007 and 2016, white and Asian American students averaged above 22, whereas Black and Latinx students hovered below 20.
When this scoring disparity has lasted for at least a decade, dismissive sound bite answers such as “hard work” and “intellect” are no longer acceptable explanations. The more accurate explanation is that standardized testing actually gauges access to academic resources, not intelligence. 
Wealthy (and usually white) students tend to prepare for standardized tests by employing private tutors and attending entrance exam boot camps, which grant not only greater exposure to test questions but also psychological preparation for the testing environment. Low-income students cannot afford these luxuries, and public education tends to offer few test-prep supplements. When considered in the context of the intersection between racial and economic privilege, what becomes clearer and clearer is a standardized testing system that categorically favors certain demographics over others. 
The socioeconomic inequity built into standardized testing should prompt University administrators to do some serious self-reflection. The University mission statement asserts that “USC is pluralistic, welcoming outstanding men and women of every race, creed and background.” In this light, standardized testing’s structure and implications are already in direct conflict with the University’s stated values. 
Opponents of the test-optional movement counter that racial inclusion cannot come at the cost of academic rigor — but this either-or mentality is fundamentally flawed.
Test scores are actually a limited predictor of college success. A 2020 University of Chicago study found that students’ high school GPAs were five times as strong as ACT scores in predicting college graduation. The researchers explained that GPA assesses a much wider range of skills, “including effort over an entire semester in many different types of classes, and demonstration of academic skills through multiple formats.”
The evidence checks out: The vast majority of college students will never again get tested on how quickly they can bubble in answers for trigonometric equations or reading comprehension sets, but they will get tested on how well they can create functional and sustainable solutions to real-world problems. Standardized tests may claim they test critical thinking, but they are clearly inferior assessments.
Perhaps removing testing requirements will empower admissions officials to place greater weight on factors such as family and community commitment, employment and cultural awareness. These metrics could potentially allow racially and economically disadvantaged students to shine where others cannot. As USC recovers from admissions scandals and attempts to shed its “University of Spoiled Children” reputation, emphasizing these factors could potentially be a step in the right direction.
USC ought to join its fellow universities in deemphasizing standardized testing in the admissions process. A test-optional policy may not be a silver bullet against inequitable admissions practices, but it is a good first step towards leveling the educational playing field.

A high schooler from my hometown addressed an open letter to the governor of New Mexico via social media: “When you sent your mandate that soccer wouldn’t happen this fall, it not only broke my heart but many other players’ as well.”
Her feelings were beyond valid. “Senior soccer season is a rite of passage, something we dream of and see in movies.” She ultimately prompted: “Have you considered what damage this is doing to teenager’s minds?”
The letter incited massive controversy, with many, including myself, noting its insensitive and privileged undertones. Surprisingly, or should I say inevitably, numerous bystanders jumped to her defense, including several adults. 
“We need more young leaders like this.” “Worth the read. Give the kids their senior year.” ”Isolation isn’t the answer, kids need these activities for their well being…” 
I have noticed a paradigm among these counterarguments to coronavirus safety restrictions. Based on social media, the majority find quarantining inconvenient to say the least, but several have gone so far as to bolster their perspectives by highlighting the negative consequences of social isolation, including rising mental health and substance abuse issues. 
However, instead of putting forth these issues to propose a solution that doesn’t compromise public safety, this subgroup utilizes mental health statistics to argue against quarantines. This paradoxical approach ostensibly stresses “compassion,” yet subverts the death toll of a global contagion and its aftermath. We should certainly prioritize mental health issues right now, but we need not weaponize them. 
To preface this argument, I want to emphasize that concerns about mental health as a result of the coronavirus are of utmost significance. Mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder tend to surge in the wake of natural disasters and the coronavirus is no exception to this pattern. To reiterate, I am not writing this to undermine anybody’s struggle. 
However, waging two public health issues against each other is counterintuitive, especially when concerns about mental health are consistently brushed under the rug when there is no global pandemic. Mental illness has always been a public health crisis, yet it’s repeatedly undermined and stigmatized. 
For instance, every time a mass shooting occurs, pro-gun activists are the first to argue that it is people, not guns, that do the killing. In this case, psychosis and lunacy are pinned as the culprits and mental health is — no pun intended — weaponized to argue against common-sense gun regulations. 
Although this logic seeks to amend violence, it ultimately perpetuates the stigma of mental illness. These arguments illuminate a fallacy that labels all mass shooters as “mentally ill” and the media consequently sensationalizes mental illness as terrorizing. 
However, a majority of people with mental illnesses do not display violent behavior. In fact, few mass shooters have a history of severe psychiatric illness, yet 38% have a history of committing domestic abuse. Plus, individuals with serious mental illness are responsible for less than 3% of all violence, and they are actually 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population. 
Not to mention the fact that gun rights advocates label mental health as the problem, yet no efforts are made to expand mental health care. Instead, the Grand Old Party continually works to cut Medicaid — the largest source of funding for mental health care in the United States. Ultimately, it just uses mental health as a scapegoat to deflect from the real issue of gun violence. 
Regarding the coronavirus, arguing in favor of lifting safety restrictions because of “mental health” digresses from the government’s lackadaisical response to the pandemic; after all, the United States leads the world in coronavirus cases. This argument is not only grossly misplaced but also insensitive to those, including myself, who struggle with a psychiatric illness every day. Masquerading a lack of compassion with superficial concerns is offensive — our illnesses do not exist as a facade to own guns or curtail pandemic restrictions. 
So how do we balance concerns about mental health with coronavirus safety? First of all, we must acknowledge the prevalence of mental illness outside of psychologically distressing events like a pandemic. Yes, cases of anxiety and depression are on the rise. Yes, there are potentially harmful implications, academically and emotionally, for students not being able to experience a normal day inside and outside the classroom. 
However, there is also a virulent, uncontained disease in the United States. The answer to these concerns is not a return to normalcy. Experiencing a life before the coronavirus again will not assuage these climbing numbers related to mental health but only magnify coronavirus infection rates, as evidenced by universities that have reopened. It will likely contribute to more psychological stress, not alleviate it. 
Instead of weaponizing statistics, maybe we should try weaponizing common sense and authentic solutions — practicing mindfulness, staying connected virtually, expanding mental health care, decriminalizing psychiatric illness and practicing socially distanced activities to protect others’ health. That sounds like true compassion to me.
