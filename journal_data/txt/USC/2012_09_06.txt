College is the time in most students’ lives when they begin to truly define themselves, find their individuality and make major life decisions. Some turn to their friends for help, some to their families and some to their faith.
The new USC Caruso Catholic Center and Our Savior Parish hopes to cater to students dealing with this experience, USC trustee Rick Caruso said.
At a mass on Monday evening, Fr. Lawrence Seyer and some of the parish’s most dedicated Catholic members celebrated the beginning of the school year and the opening of the renewed center after 10 years of construction and preparation.
The previous two buildings simply were too small to provide sufficient resources for the nearly 10,000 Catholic students out of the combined 37,000 undergraduate and graduate students at USC.
Caruso, the benefactor for the construction, joked that the initial architectural plans for the buildings simply weren’t spectacular enough to do his faith justice.
“In my mind, this center is all about being the best,” Caruso said. “The students at USC are the best in the country, and we need to have a place where we talk about our religion, our faith — where we think about the importance of our faith, and how it plays a role in our life.”
Caruso hopes USC’s Catholic Center will be similar to the Hoover Institute’s think tank, saying that USC now has the opportunity to be better than other universities in the religious and spiritual realm.
Dean of Religious Studies Varun Soni said he agrees with Caruso.
“The ages of 18 and 26 are the best times in students’ lives to ask the big questions of ‘who am I?’ and ‘what is the purpose of life?’” Soni said. “The university experience enables students to think about these questions both inside and outside the classroom.”
Now, the separate courtyard, stone chapel and brick student center make up over 27,000 sq. ft. as opposed to the old combined chapel and center’s 10,000 sq. ft. The new Romanesque chapel features shimmering marble floors, high wooden ceilings and a beautiful stone crucifix in the center of the hall.
“The new building definitely has a more Catholic presence and feel to it than the previous one,” said Alex Retana, a senior majoring in history and social science education.
With more modern architecture, the chapel and center fits in well with other USC buildings, especially with the new developments being made to campus by President C. L. Max Nikias.
Though Mass and various service programs are geared toward Catholic students, the two new buildings are open to all.
“It’s not just for Catholic students — my hope is that all walks of life come through these doors,” Caruso said. “Every religion and every ethnicity can come through these doors and learn about each other’s faiths and through all of that, we’ll get stronger.”
The Catholic community is looking to expand their student programs along with their physical buildings, according to Caruso. The new center aims to increase student involvement with innovative outreach ministries, programs, events and lecture series in order to invigorate intellectual life on campus.
For example, Peer Ministry President Victoria Alonso became involved with the USC Catholic Center by joining the “Small Catholic Community” where she discussed her faith with other students.
“The Catholic Center has really allowed me to grow in my faith as well as provided balance in my life,” she said.
Pastoral Council Chair Sergio Avelar, a senior majoring in environmental studies, said the Catholic community at USC is one of his passions and said other students can find similar excitement in the new center.
“There’s so much we can do, and why not now?” Avelar said. “This is the perfect time — we have a brand new facility and we’re looking to be one of the top campus ministries in the country.”

The first drug and alcohol recovery residence for USC students, The Haven, opens Sept. 21 at the University Gateway Apartments. The Haven, which houses the Recovery Grads program, focuses on supporting USC students struggling with addiction and provides a path for them to pursue sobriety while earning their college degree.
“When students experience the freedom of college and are in a culture that celebrates drinking, some of them hit a wall,” The Haven co-founder Holly Sherman said. “They are unable to control their drinking and drug use and end up in treatment, but then so frequently [tbey] can’t come back to school because there’s no safe place to turn.”
The Haven aims to be a comfortable environment for students. Though it is independent from USC, The Haven is strategically located at the University Gateway Apartments because it offers residents a feeling of inclusiveness with the greater student body. The recovery program is centered on providing structure and support for students while showing them they can have the full college experience without using alcohol and drugs.
Recovery Grads program could encounter difficulties on campus, some students said.
“It sounds like it would be great for those individuals,” said James Birks, a graduate student in the Rossier School of Education. “I’m curious to see the challenges it faces since alcohol is prominent on campus, such as at games and tailgates and [on] The Row. I’m also curious as to what type of training the RAs have.”
The Haven has one male and one female house manager to oversee the needs of the residents. The house managers have previous experience dealing with their own personal addictions.
“For me, personally, I am excited to show people that you are able to go to college with addiction,” said The Haven’s male house manager who requested anonymity.
Currently, four students are signed up to live in the apartment complex, but the program has space for 20 students. Students can stay in the program for any length of time.
Program directors expect enrollment to increase after the first students move in and as the need for the initiative rises. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, college students are currently the fastest growing sector of people seeking addiction treatment in the United States.
“Students come through various channels. They can come through the counseling center, as a referral for treatment centers and they can come through word of mouth from the students around campus,” Sherman said. “Because there’s this need, people are starting to just come to us.”
A primary roadblock to reaching more students in need of the program’s services is the stigma surrounding addiction.
“If you have an addiction, it doesn’t mean you’re a failure,” the male house manager said. “Yet if there’s no solution, you are going to fail.”
Despite efforts to instate the Recovery Grads program on other college campuses nationally, USC and the University of Nevada at Reno are the only universities to house the new initiative.
“USC is very forward-thinking and they also really care about their students,” Sherman said. “It’s just an example of how USC implements plans that cares for its students. It’s in alignment with how the university thinks.”
Opinions about the expansion of a program directed at tackling drug and alcohol addiction vary.
“There is more of a party culture on campus than a drug one,” said Johnny de La Cruz, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “There might be a couple of people who use drugs sporadically, but not enough to have a floor for them.”
Despite skepticism among some students about the effectiveness of this program, the male house manager believes The Haven will have a larger impact on the university as a whole.
“It will create greater acceptance of every individual. Because when you have a problem with drugs and alcohol you feel different, you feel estranged, you feel isolated and alone,” he said. “This program closes that gap. We hope to help people that are feeling alone and show them love to help cultivate their life.”
For more information about The Haven, students can contact 310-822-1234.
Hey Tommy,
My comment was about the damaging effects to individuals and USC overall from markedly impaired individuals due to alcohol and drugs.
Student over-indulgence at any college can be a passing phase, where individuals experience periods of heavy drinking or drug use, realize they’ve gone a bit overboard, and then change their behavior as a response to mild to severe consequences. These individuals must be distinguished from people who simply cannot stop drinking and/or using drugs regardless of what is happening around them. Then it is no longer a question of will power — it’s about addiction, and it can happen to anyone. These are students who could really benefit from support from professionals and their peers, other students who have “been there” and a very cool community of like-minded college students who know how to navigate life sober and have a blast doing it!! Go Trojans!!
The reality is USC has a drug/alcohol problem overall which needs to be addressed. Just ask campus security about alcohol impaired coeds stumbling home at 3 a.m. from the row rudely refusing assistance. For the well-being of students and the goal of USC to be the best in the West and vanquish the “party school” criticisms, excessive alcohol use needs to be addressed campus wide.  Campus police need greater authority to intervene when students show obvious signs of alcohol impairment, disciplinary boards need to awaken from their slumber, student services need to step up their educative programs and student health services need campus wide programs for healthy alcohol use including none at all. Most leading universities seem more invested than USC in creating a healthy climate for alcohol and drug use on campus. How about it USC admins? Are you up for the challenge?
Come on Gabriel grow up.  They are college kids who want to have fun and experience life on their own for the first time.  Sometimes they screw up, sometimes they don’t but stop trying to micromanage and control everyone.  The reality is, college students, high school students, drug dealers, counterfeiters, etc. will outsmart the administration every time (i.e. The United States War On Drugs).  People will always develop new ways to find alcohol or drugs and the administration will always be one step behind because they have to uncover and then understand the new methods.  The more someone tells you not to do something, the more enticing that thing becomes, Psychology 101.

Some California Science Center board members expressed concerns over leasing of the Coliseum to USC to the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday and Thursday.
A Science Center board vote will determine if USC can have control of the Exposition Park parking lots. Though some board members wanted to quickly vote on the issue, others are wary after scandals related to management of the Coliseum and of possible ill effects to museum attendance.
Three members of the Coliseum Commission, two rave promoters and a contractor were indicted on corruption charges last year. USC got control of the Coliseum lease in May, but in July the Times and a public interest group sued the Coliseum Commission with allegations that it violated transparency laws by negotiating USC’s lease in secret and withholding certain stadium documents. The commission denied the allegations and the suit is pending.
Science Center Board Chairman Robert L. Stein told the Times that he would have opposed allowing the commission to run the stadium if he had known about the alleged corruption.
On the other hand, William Chadwick, who has sat on the museum and Coliseum boards for several years, said USC should get control of the parking lots and that the vote should be held without delay.
“In my view, a public hearing is unnecessary, inappropriate and of questionable legal validity,” Chadwick told the Times.
Science Center President Jeffery Rudolph said he had concerns over parking and USC’s use of the stadium for events other than football games, such as soccer games and concerts.
“We can’t function without parking,” Rudolph told the Times. “I’m talking about the ability to ensure there’s parking available for school buses for children coming to the Science Center … the African American Museum, the Natural History Museum and for families that come here.”
The temporary manager of the Coliseum disputed some of Rudolph’s claims to the Times.
A public hearing is scheduled for Oct. 3.

Henry Russell Sanders, UCLA’s football coach in the ’50s, once said that “beating ’SC is not a matter of life or death, it’s more important than that.” From time to time, however, defectors do arise and as the idiom goes, politics makes for strange bedfellows.
City hall · Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa supports USC’s Master Plan and Coliseum agreement, he said at an Institute of Politics event in August. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
In 1977, Antonio Villaraigosa received a bachelor’s degree in history from UCLA. But today, as the mayor of Los Angeles, Villaraigosa has worked to help USC expand its footprint in the city, so much so that he admits to putting in a few extra hours to help his alma mater’s cross-town rival.
“What I love about ’SC is they see their destiny as tied to our city, and that’s important,” Villaraigosa said to an audience of about 150 on a warm August evening. “And that’s why I work overtime to make things work for ’SC.”
It was 6 p.m. when the mayor took his seat on the stage of a Taper Hall  of Humanities lecture auditorium Aug. 8. He was at USC for a conversation with Dan Schnur, the director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and an interview with the Daily Trojan.
From endorsing USC development plans to praising its agreement to control the Coliseum, Villaraigosa has welcomed the university’s decade-long effort to establish a lasting mark on the city.
Roughly 20 years ago, after USC officials decided to keep the campus in its current location, the university began working more closely with politicians, said Thomas Sayles, senior vice president for university relations.
“We decided we were going to commit ourselves to the community, which means we have to work with the elected officials as well as the community,” Sayles said.
According to Sayles, the university regularly communicates with the mayor’s office, lobbying the Villaraigosa administration on a wide range of initiatives.
“We try to brief his office on what we are doing, [and] we seek his support on projects,” Sayles said. “He’s actually been a very big supporter of the university.”
In the interview after his talk with Schnur, Villaraigosa outlined his position on several USC projects.
Villaraigosa said he is a proponent of USC’s master plan to renovate the University Village, creating new retail space and student housing.
“With respect to the Master Plan, I’ve said, ‘Hey, look, we’ve got to mitigate the impacts on the surrounding community. We’ve got to ensure that the community benefits … with it,’” Villaraigosa said. “But I think it’s a net plus.”
The mayor also said he supports USC’s master lease agreement to gain operational control of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, chastising the commission that oversees the stadium for wasting the historic landmark.
“It’s very clear that the Coliseum Commission has squandered a great asset, and I believe that ’SC would be a better steward,” he said. “I think we have to drive a tough deal that benefits the city, the state, the county and the surrounding community, and I think that will happen.”
The deal between USC and the Coliseum Commission is pending approval from three state agencies.
During Villaraigosa’s time in office, Schnur said he believes the mayor has found more ways to collaborate with the university.
“My impression is that the more time he spends in office, the more he’s seen natural links and shared opportunities between the city and the campus,” Schnur said.
In addition to forming a greater professional connection to USC during his tenure, Villaraigosa’s personal connections to the university have also grown. In 2006, the mayor was awarded an honorary doctorate after delivering the university’s commencement address. And last year, Villaraigosa’s ties became even stronger when his daughter began college as a Trojan. As a USC parent, the mayor said he was especially affected when two Chinese graduate students were fatally shot off campus around 2 a.m. last April.
“When I got word of that tragedy, I was awake in the middle of the night,” he said. “I have a daughter here. It was personal.”
Though the mayor said USC’s surrounding neighborhoods are safer than they have been in 20 years, he said the university and the city must always work to keep the area protected.
“This university is absolutely committed to keeping this neighborhood and this university community as safe as possible and so are we,” he said. “That’s why we are collaborating and working together. But we [have] to always make sure that we’re doing everything possible to keep this great jewel of a community and this great jewel of a university a place where people feel safe.”
Following the shooting of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, two 23-year-old graduate students studying electrical engineering, the Los Angeles Police Department announced several new security measures at a press conference April 26. Among them was the addition of 30 police officers to the Southwest Division, which patrols around the campus. The university funded some of the changes. The parents of Qu and Wu filed a wrongful death suit against the university May 18.
Whether at a press conference, participating in an event or visiting a class, Villaraigosa is a frequent visitor to campus.
“He’s never turned me down,” Schnur said. “Every time we’ve asked him to come to campus for a program, he’s either accepted that invitation or asked his office to find another time when he could be over here.”
Still, when it comes to a UCLA and USC match-up, Villaraigosa is far from ready to toss aside his Bruin roots.
“I hope UCLA wins at everything they play against USC,” Villaraigosa said. “But I’ve changed over the years. Now I’m for ’SC when they play against the world.”
I thought it was funny albeit he didn’t intend to be, when Villaraigosa said something like, “stand up, turn around, take a good look at your parents…this is what a $40,000/yr. education is all about…”

As the final night of the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Charlotte, N. C. on Thursday, students and faculty gathered in the lobby of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to watch President Barack Obama accept the Democratic presidential nomination.
Captive audience · Dozens of students congregated in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism lobby Thursday to view the Democratic National Convention. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
After viewing the speech, attendees watched a panel discussion sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and moderated by its director, Dan Schnur. Panelists included Matt Rodriguez, former western states regional director of Obama for America 2008, Kaya Masler, president of USC Trojans for Obama, and Geneva Overholser, director of the School of Journalism at Annenberg.
The nearly 6,000 delegates attending the convention formally nominated Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for re-election on Wednesday night following a speech by former President Bill Clinton.
Obama emphasized the idea that voters are not choosing between two different candidates or two different parties, but two different paths for America.
“The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And I’m asking you to choose that future,” Obama said. “I’m asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country — goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security and the deficit; a real, achievable plan that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation.”
Not all students believe that Obama offers the best path for the future of the nation, however.
“We are facing the worst economic recovery in American history,” said Alex Yebri, a senior majoring in political science and president of USC Trojans for Romney. “President Obama is a nice guy and a good public speaker, but the reality is that Americans do not believe that they are better off than they were four years ago.”
Obama acknowledged the economy still needs work, but laid out his plan for reducing the national deficit and decreasing unemployment if re-elected.
“Now you have a choice: we can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here, in the United States of America,” he said.
Though Obama spent much of his speech reminding voters of the accomplishments of his first term, Masler said voters might be focused on more recent developments such as the monthly jobs reports.
“Do people care what he’s done for the past four years?” Masler asked. “I don’t know if people care about that as much about what he has done recently.”
[Correction: A previous version of this article misrepresented the context of Kaya Masler’s quote with the description: “Obama spent much of his speech reminding voters of the accomplishments of his first term. Some questioned whether this is an effective strategy for him, though.” The text of the article has been updated.]

Coming off of winning the Trojan Invitational last weekend, the fifth-ranked USC women’s volleyball team will look to make it back-to-back tournament victories this weekend in the USC Classic Tournament hosted at the Galen Center.
Streaking · Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller (22) has led USC to a 6-0 start in the 2012 season. She had 328 kills last season. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy will have their 6-0 record tested against the likes of SoCal rival No. 17 San Diego (3-1), who they will play first on Friday at 7 p.m.
A sweep of the USC Classic Tournament would put the Women of Troy’s start on par with that of the 2010 squad that won its first 12 matches to open up the year. Although the Women of Troy have won 24 of  26 sets so far this season, head coach Mick Haley still thinks USC has some work to do.
“We’re in the process of becoming a really good team. We just need to get through these ups and downs and work on reducing our hitting errors,” Haley said. “The team is focused and they’re trying hard. They’re certainly not at the top of their game yet but improvement is possible and we’ve got a lot of athleticism.”
While coach Haley says the team as a whole isn’t at the top of its game yet, it is hard to imagine that freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio could play any better than she has the past two weeks. For the second consecutive week, the 6-foot-2 outside hitter from Guadalajara, Mexico, has garnered the Pac-12’s freshman of the week honors. On top of that, Bricio was named MVP of the Texas A&M Invitational and was also an all-tournament selection for the Trojan Invitational last weekend.
“Samantha Bricio has been able to score points for us, which is a very good thing,” Haley said. “We put her out there because of her ball control skills and she’s been a little hot and cold with her passing, but she has gotten much better with her blocking.”
In other news, senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller was recently named the most valuable player for the Trojan Invitational. She tallied 10 kills in the final match. Because of her experience both on and off the court, Fuller has emerged as the bona fide leader of what can be a considered a green, albeit talented, USC squad.
Fuller will lead the Women of Troy against a talented Toreros team ranked in the Top 20 this year. San Diego will be looking to avenge its season-ending loss to USC in the second round of last year’s NCAA tournament behind stars Chloe Ferrari, Katie Hoekman and Alaysia Brown.
When asked about how USC will handle this upcoming weekend, Fuller seemed cautious but confident.
“We need to continue to focus on our side of the net,” Fuller said. “We just need to be able to play whoever comes in front of us.”
One of the biggest surprises of the year has been the outstanding play of USC’s freshmen. Coach Haley praised all four freshmen and said that their play on the court even surprised some of the older girls on the team.
Specifically, Haley went out of his way to praise freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms and freshman outside hitter Kiara Wright for their play so far.

Much of the hype around this weekend’s game against Syracuse has been focused on its location: MetLife Stadium, home of the world champion New York Giants and the media circus that is the New York Jets. But head coach Lane Kiffin stressed Thursday after the team’s final practice of the week that this trip was all about business.
“It’s not about where you play, it’s about playing really well, regardless,” Kiffin said. “We’re flying there with one thing in mind and that’s to win the game and get back home.”
Kiffin expressed a similar sentiment before last year’s first road game of the season against Arizona State in Tempe, AZ. The team showed its inexperience in that game, losing 43-22. Kiffin expects the team’s leaders to prevent a similar result this week.
“Hopefully the young guys handle [the trip] really well,” Kiffin said. “We do have some senior leaders for them to learn from. Over the years, we’ve been a pretty good road team, and hopefully we’ll continue that.”
In the Trojans’ season-opening victory over Hawaii, the team amassed 475 yards of offense, but gained just 81 yards rushing on 23 carries, good for 3.5 yards per rush. Despite the lack of production from the ground game, Kiffin does not plan on emphasizing the running attack.
“We’re going to do the best thing to win, regardless of what that is,” Kiffin said. “Whether that’s throwing a bunch or running a bunch, whoever gets the touches gets the touches. But we need to get to 2-0.”
The biggest challenge USC faces this week is Syracuse quarterback Ryan Nassib. In the Orange’s week one loss to Northwestern, Nassib obliterated school records with 44 completions and 65 pass attempts. A dual-threat quarterback, he completed 62.4% of his passes last season with 22 touchdowns and just nine interceptions.
“He’s really, really good and extremely efficient,” Kiffin said. “Whether he’s completing balls or not taking sacks and making a few yards scrambling, he makes a ton of plays and does not make many mistakes.”
The defensive lines for both teams will also be a huge factor in Saturday’s game. Syracuse’s front four, though undersized, present a tough matchup for the USC offensive line.
“When you watch the film, you don’t realize [that they’re undersized] because they’re so strong,” Kiffin said. “They are very physical. We’re going to have our hands full.”
On the other side of the ball, USC wants to get Syracuse in passing situations and put pressure on Nassib to make mistakes.
“Getting them into some third and long situations is key,” Kiffin said. “[Our defensive backs] need to find a way to cover their guys long enough so we can get a pass rush.”
When asked if his team viewed this game as an opportunity to extend the Pac-12’s brand to the east coast, Kiffin again preached that this was a business trip.
“I think for our fans, our university, yes, it is important,” Kiffin said. “But for this team, no. I don’t even know for sure if these kids know where they’re playing. This is about the eleven guys out there executing very well, and that’s what we plan on doing.”

In some ways, senior quarterback Matt Barkley gets a raw deal.
It’s not just the astronomical expectations he shoulders with aplomb -— expectations so high that many question why his completion percentage wasn’t higher in last week’s game against Hawai’i in which he threw for 372 yards and four touchdowns — or the reality that, after all he’s contributed to USC, one vicious hit might jeopardize his NFL prospects.
It’s mostly the fact that Barkley should already be a multi-millionaire.
The USC Athletic Department recently launched a multi-sport marketing initiative. “WE PLAY” billboards and banners decorate campus, with cardinal-colored W, E, P and Y and gold-colored L and A letters printed on stylized black-and-white photos.
The wordplayfeels slightly less forced than the “SCampus” manuals we have all undoubtedly read. Any university in Los Angeles could have adopted this slogan.
But, my biggest, and most serious, grievance with the campaign is that it’s another feat of student-athlete exploitation encouraged by the amateur rules the NCAA has set in place.
In advance of its game against Syracuse at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., USC brought its “WE PLAY” campaign to the East Coast.
On a Times Square video board, USC coach Lane Kiffin and senior quarterback Matt Barkley are captured scrutinizing a play chart, under a bold proclamation of “WE P-LA-Y FOR A NEW ERA.”
In Los Angeles, No. 7 jerseys can be spotted at on-campus tailgates or swooning in the stands when Barkley appears on the jumbotron. Unfortunately, this doesn’t equate to any money for the prohibitive Heisman favorite to pocket.
The NCAA will counter the idea of players making money, saying that its amateur model ensures the “student” half of student-athlete does not become an absolute sham.
NCAA athletes not named Cam Newton can’t earn a salary in addition to their scholarships. They can’t appear in a Wrangler jeans commercial playing muddy Mississippi football in backyards with Brett Favre.
But it’s only through a comically broken NCAA system that USC can make millions selling the likeness of its most marketable commodity: Barkley — an articulate, humble, lifelong USC fan who is resurrecting the program from dark depths.
Some of the T-shirts from which USC has profited read, “Stay in SC-hool” and “Unfinished Business” — the latter of which is a rallying cry Barkley invoked at the press conference announcing his return for his senior season on Dec. 22, 2011.
And the exploitation won’t even stop in April 2013, when Matt Barkley will shake NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s hand and don his new NFL team’s cap.
If Barkley wins the Heisman and a BCS bowl game, think of all the memorabilia USC will sell now and in the future. The possibilities are endless.
The worst part about this exploitation, though, is that there’s no obvious solution.
Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that democracy is the worst form of governance besides all the rest.
It’s entirely possible that the NCAA’s rules related to amateurism exist in a similar sense. If there were easy fixes that could still maintain the integrity of the academic degree, they would have already been made.
The delineation between college and professional sports must be unmistakable, but as time goes on, our college football-crazed country is making it increasingly difficult for the NCAA to pretend there’s an actual difference.
College stars are commodities. If universities plan to exploit that fact shamelessly, student-athletes should be able to pursue their own endorsements.

I think $50,000+ worth in tuition is a pretty good deal – many don’t even make that much as their salary in one year. Also you’re using an outlier, in Matt Barkley, as an example. There are 75 scholarship athletes on the football team but only a handful would get their numbers sold and be placed on SC marketing media per year. Let’s keep in mind that the players need the school just as much as the school needs the player. The athletes have a great opportunity to receive an excellent degree from a prominent university, the time to develop/improve, and exposure to make it to the NFL. At the end of the day, I bet a lot of parents would be grateful to be able to save $200,000 (4 yr scholarship) by sending their kid to college on scholarship.
Have you ever heard of a situation where a student trademarked their name back in middle school / high school (say they were an elite spelling bee champion or something) and then went on to become a star college athlete?  I was wondering how a situation like that might work when it came to making money / NCAA rules.

The top-ranked USC men’s water polo team (3-0) will play in its first home match of the season Saturday against No. 17 Cal Baptist (0-2).
Leading the pack · Senior two-meter Matt Burton is one of the captains on this year’s squad. He was a third-team All-American in 2011. – Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The match is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m., while the annual Alumni Game that follows is scheduled for 11:45 a.m.
USC’s McDonald’s Swimming Stadium is hosting both the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and NCAA tournaments  this year, so Saturday’s match could be the first of many Trojan home victories this season.
USC steamrolled the competition over the weekend, winning their three games by a combined score of 65-10.
The Trojans squared off against Cal Baptist in the second weekend of the season in 2011 as well, and defeated the Lancers easily, 14-3.
Captain and senior two-meter Matt Burton, however, gave praise to the Lancers’ goalie, Austin Ramer.
“He’ll hit a man in stride at any time to create a quick goal,” Burton said. “He’s really dangerous on the counter attack.”
While the game will not have the intensity or competition that a matchup against a conference rival brings, it still provides valuable early-season experience.
“We did not execute high percentage opportunities enough,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Some of our returning players did not play their best last weekend, and we want to see improvement on Saturday.”
Burton echoed Vavic’s attitude on how the team views Saturday’s game.
“It’s kind of like a dress rehearsal,” Burton said. “We’re going to test out plays and make sure we don’t make mental errors. We can get away with those here, but Cal and Stanford will punish you for those [mistakes].”
Additionally, these early non-conference matchups give the coaching staff more time to sort out positional battles before the level of competition and pressure increases during conference play.
For example, the race is between sophomore Ely Bonilla and freshman James Clark to replace Cutino Award Winner Joel Dennerley in goal.
Clark has yet to receive game time, but the talented backup for the Australian Olympic squad this summer is sure to see some action in the non-conference slate.
Additionally, the games leading up to MPSF play will give a better insight into who can fulfill the second half of a 1-2 scoring punch with junior driver Nikola Vavic after 2011’s leading scorer Peter Kurzeka’s graduation.
Vavic leads the team so far with 10 goals, while sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias is second with six goals. Redshirt junior driver Stephen Siri is third with five goals, while five other players are tied with four goals apiece.
In fact, 19 players already have notched a goal this season after 21 individual players put the ball in the net at least once last season.
Whether it’s balance or simply a slate of lower-caliber opponents that allow the backups and third-string to play significant minutes, this trend of variety in scoring will be sure to continue this Saturday, as well as throughout the non-conference schedule.

The Women of Troy take a short road trip this Sunday to play Cal State-Northridge, a school that the women’s soccer program has never lost to. With USC (2-3-0) recovering from three straight comeback losses, that sounds like an ideal opponent for the Women of Troy.
But according to the Matadors’ record (3-1-1) so far this season, this is not the same team that USC is 3-0 against all-time; after all, they haven’t played each other since 2008.
And Northridge has already claimed victories over Michigan (5-2) and San Diego (3-3), whom USC lost to 2-1 in their last match on Sunday.
The deflating defeat, which saw the Women of Troy give up a 1-0 lead for the third straight game, left a bad taste in the mouth of USC coach Ali Khosroshahin.
“We keep leaking goals like this, it’s not good,” Khosroshahin said after the loss. “We’ve got to figure this out in a hurry.”
“After we get one goal, we can’t be satisfied,” said freshman defender Marlee Carrillo. “We need to just keep on going, keep pushing for more.”
The Women of Troy have allowed eight goals off of 31 shots in the second half this season, compared to only three scores from 33 shots in the first half.
Getting their own shots off hasn’t been the problem for the Women of Troy- they’ve outshot their opponents 50-39 during the three-game skid. But they’ve been outscored 8-3 in that same period.
Over the whole season, 10 of the team’s 93 shots have found the back of the net for a .108 shot percentage.
“We just need to learn to finish our chances,” Carrillo said. “We had a lot of shots, a lot of opportunities, we just need to capitalize on them. That’s what we’re working on this week [in practice].”
Khosroshahin says he also wants his team to control the ball more often than they have been.
“We’ve created chances, [but] our possession needs to be better,” Khosroshahin said. “But it’s a young group that hasn’t played together very long, so that part of the game takes a little longer to get better at.”
USC will need to find some more offensive firepower against the stingy Matador defense, which has shut out opposing offenses in three out of their five matches. Northridge senior goalkeeper Cynthia Jacobo, last year’s Big West Goalkeeper of the Year, has made 23 saves with three goals allowed. Jacobo sports a 0.57 goals-against average.
The Women of Troy won’t want to dig themselves in a deep hole against the Matadors; since the start of the 2008 season, Northridge is 23-1-1 when scoring at least two goals.
Luckily for the Women of Troy, the Matadors haven’t been as imposing on offense as they have been on defense. Only seven of their 80 shots have provided pay dirt for a .088 shot percentage.
Statistically, the Matadors are led on offense by senior midfielder Stephanie Galarze (two goals) and senior defender Stephanie Norton (three assists).
Junior midfielder Jordan Marada and freshman midfielder Megan Borman both lead USC with two goals, and Marada also leads the squad with four assists.
Although the Women of Troy were disappointed with their missed opportunities against Duke and San Diego, they seem confident that they can rebound against the Matadors to get another streak going.
“We have to move on and keep our heads up,” said freshman forward Jamie Fink, who says she has extra motivation to win this weekend since her old club coach is now managing the Matadors. “We’ve just got to punish them.”

In his Wednesday meeting with the media, Lane Kiffin was asked if USC’s matchup against Syracuse and its up-tempo offense on Saturday would be like “basketball on grass.”
Kiffin’s response: “It’s our job to change that. It’s our job to get a good pass rush going.”
On their toes · Junior cornerback Nickell Robey and the USC defense will be tested against Syracuse’s passing game. Orange quarterback Ryan Nassib threw for 482 passing yards last weekend against Northwestern. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Trojans’ coach is aware of the obvious predicament: Syracuse can score.
In its season opener against Northwestern last week, a 42-41 loss, the Orange amassed 596 total yards, including 482 by way of the right arm of quarterback Ryan Nassib, who set a school single-game passing yards record. Nassib, who in total tallied 512 yards, also managed to break program records for completions (45) and attempts (66).
“You’ve got a quarterback who threw for more yards than anybody in the country,” Kiffin said of the 6-foot-2 senior signal caller, whose 482 passing yards place him atop the Football Bowl Subdivision after week one. “And a lot of people played football Saturday.”
But after scoring more than 40 points in its opener, a 39-point win over Hawai’i, No. 2 USC (1-0) will be expected to keep pace with that fast-paced attack in the inaugural “New York’s College Classic.” With its unit highlighted by a handful of familiar names – senior quarterback Matt Barkley and wide receivers Marqise Lee and Robert Woods, among others — USC has scored at least 40 in five of its last six contests, spanning to last October. That’s to say its next matchup could very well become basketball on grass. Both can score.
Saturday’s game is slated for a 12:30 p.m. kickoff at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. It will be the Trojans’ first road game of the season.
“This is going to be a big test for our guys,” Kiffin said. “Last week we weren’t really tested much. We have to do better.”
USC should, though, at least get a bit of a boost on defense after missing three starters against Hawai’i.
Sophomore middle linebacker Lamar Dawson and junior cornerback Torin Harris insist they’ll be back in the lineup after being sidelined with injuries. Should they in fact suit up, Dawson will likely replace redshirt freshman Anthony Sarao, as sophomore Hayes Pullard moves back to his normal weakside linebacker position after temporarily starting in the middle against the Warriors.
“Hopefully, I just get on the field, make plays and get everybody lined up,” Dawson said.
Similarly, Harris should displace another makeshift starter in sophomore Anthony Brown, who will slide over to the nickel cornerback slot. Senior defensive end Wes Horton’s status, though, remains unknown.
Even with their absence, the Trojans managed to force four turnovers against Hawai’i, including two interceptions. And as Syracuse (0-1), under fourth-year coach Doug Marone, plans to throw upward of 50 times, players don’t appear fazed — not yet anyway.
“I like any team that likes to throw,” said junior cornerback Nickell Robey. “I’m up for it. It gives me another chance to break on routes, bait up defenders, bait up quarterbacks.”
Though Kiffin suggested keeping the game at a slower pace as a result of the Orange’s no-huddle offense, USC hardly appears uncomfortable playing at a faster tempo. A week ago, it jumped out to a 20-0 lead in less than 12 minutes, highlighted by touchdowns of 75 and 31 yards. Not to mention it threw the ball 30 times in the opening half and later a 100-yard kick return from Lee.
Named Pac-12 Player of the Week, Lee, in particular, has been explosive as of late. Since last November — which encompasses five games — the sophomore wideout has caught 49 passes for 806 yards and seven touchdowns. And USC, as a result, has been 5-0.
“A few guys in our group are explosive,” said Tee Martin, USC’s first-year wide receivers coach. “But Marqise does a good job of running past people and threatening people deep down field. He was that last year and this year hopefully we can get him to continue to do that. He’s a big-play type receiver.”
All week long, USC has been contending its foremost priority is slowing down Syracuse and preventing big plays, but its own ability to score and score quickly might serve it well enough as it looks to beat the Orange for the fourth time in the four meetings between the programs.
“We want to be able to start well again,” Kiffin said. “We’ve been fortunate to do that.”

As blockbuster games such as Darksiders II and Madden NFL 13 marked the end of August, the video game community awaits the fourth quarter of the much-observed release calendar.
Avid gamers know that the late third quarter and fourth quarter generally boast the largest and most successful releases for gaming — just in time for the holidays. Although the wait for later-release big shots like Dishonored, Assassin’s Creed III and Halo 4, continues September supplies plenty of games to enjoy in the meantime. Here are three of the month’s most notable games:
Strap on your skates and step on the ice. Sept. 11 welcomes the release of the month’s first major game, EA Sports’ NHL 13.
Boasting Claude Giroux, right winger for the Philadelphia Flyers, on its cover, NHL 13 packs a walloping punch between slap shots and broken teeth. But, the same common dilemma seems to arise with the sports genre: What will make this game different from the last?
Artificial intelligence seems to be the main focus of the development team this year; players can react to everything on the ice, not just what is directly in front of them. Thus, gameplay has become smarter and more challenging, reflecting the minds of the actual NHL stars made virtual for the video game.
New physics and new AI calls for unique gameplay, which is what sports genre fans pray for each year. It seems like EA might have gotten the hat trick with NHL 13.
If sports fans think their wallets can still handle September, they will shell out for FIFA 13, the world’s most popular sports video game according to VIBE.
The developed gameplay trend continues here with a player impact engine. Players will not simply smack and tumble over each other. Collisions are now manipulative, allowing the controller to push off of a collision or go in for a quick steal. Players can also now analyze defenses completely and plan how to break them down.
Like FIFA 12 before it, FIFA 13 will also include international leagues and tournaments such as the Euros and World Cup, although EA hasn’t confirmed exactly which teams.
Despite, or perhaps because of,  this secrecy, FIFA 13 is the season’s most surefire hit. Pick it up on shelves on Sept. 25.
Another Sept. 25 release — this one for fantasy fans — is Blizzard Entertainment’s major expansion pack for its golden child, World of Warcraft.
Dubbed Mists of Pandaria, the pack will feature a new species called Pandaren, walking and talking pandas equipped with bowstaffs.
Gamers should also expect a new class, the Monk. The Monk class saps power from energy sources to strengthen basic moves in a “Dragonball-Z-esque” manner.
Yet as odd as it sounds, the new gameplay features seems mostly promising. Like the other World of Warcraft expansion packs, Mists of Pandaria will introduce five additional levels of gameplay.
You might not have anticipated a month of ice brawls, penalty kicks or weapon-wielding pandas, but these releases could entertain even the pickiest gamer — at least until October.

Before the USS Enterprise first voyaged into the final frontier or George Lucas created a galaxy far far away, there was a madman in a blue box.
Premiering in 1963, the BBC’s Doctor Who is — by a huge margin — the longest-running science-fiction series ever created.
It’s no surprise, then, that the show is dearly beloved by a diverse and widespread community with more history than just about any other pop-culture collective. And with the new season’s premiere last week, that already large fanbase has the potential to increase its numbers.
It’s not particularly strange for different generations of fans to have several opportunities to jump onboard a popular series. Take Star Trek for example. The franchise consists of five live-action TV series and 11 feature films. To call someone a Star Trek fan leaves a lot to question: Is a fan someone who’s watched every episode and film of every incarnation of Star Trek since the original series first aired in 1966, or a 10-year-old who knows nothing of the franchise beyond J.J. Abram’s 2009 blockbuster reboot?
When it comes to fan bases with differing levels of exposure to the franchise that they love, nothing quite matches the so-called “Whovians.” The simplicity of the show’s set-up allows for near-infinite storytelling and an equally infinite fanbase. The Doctor and his companions travel to different points in the history of time and space where something bad is happening. They have an adventure and the Doctor fixes it, because he’s the hero. From that premise, there’s been half a century of storytelling on TV and beyond, with plenty of ups, downs and new fans along the way.
Whenever the titular Doctor is in mortal duress, he avoids death through a process called regeneration. Thanks to his alien biology, the time-traveling adventurer can take on an entirely new appearance with a personality that, while altered, is still inherent to the spirit of the character. Thanks to this ingenious device, the continuation of the series has no dependency on the cast. Whenever the lead actor’s time on the show is done, the Doctor regenerates and a different actor takes over the role.
That spirit of rebirth and rejuvenation has extended to the series as a whole, and because of it, the franchise is thought of as more of an institution to which people are lucky enough to contribute than as somebody’s singular vision. Anyone who acts in or writes for the show does so with the knowledge that Doctor Who is meant to continue long after they’re done working on it. It’s a cultural landmark that — like the iconic blue TARDIS space ship in which the Doctor travels — is much bigger than the sum of its parts.
Ironically, the show’s effective cancellation in 1989 contributed to its current popularity. The BBC promised it would return one day, and true to their word, Russell T. Davies revived the series in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston as the ninth incarnation of the Doctor. Thanks to the global media landscape that arose while Who was absent from the airwaves, this “New Who” expanded the audience wider than ever before.
Now Americans could board the TARDIS and begin to discover what made the show so iconic across the pond. And though it might never be as universally recognized in the States as in the U.K., its popularity is on the rise.
In its most recent couple of seasons, nothing has done more to increase Who’s mainstream appeal than the takeover of the show by Steven Moffat, the writer behind some of the more celebrated new episodes. Under his direction and the introduction of Matt Smith’s manic Eleventh Doctor alongside Karen Gillan as companion Amy Pond, the show has a modern polish that Davies never really captured. Now sleeker than ever, Who actually looks like the science fiction marvel that it is.
The content itself, however, is a matter of some debate, especially when Moffat reaches for the stars with episodes and story arcs that can be outright outlandish or ridiculous in how far they’re willing to go. To get an idea, the most recent season featured an episode titled “Let’s Kill Hitler” and a finale that somehow saw all of time occurring simultaneously. Scientific accuracy isn’t the name of the game, as David Tennant’s Tenth Doctor made clear when he referred to time as a “big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff.”
But as complicated or silly as things might get, every episode has the potential for greatness. Just last weekend, author Neil Gaiman won a prestigious Hugo award for writing “The Doctor’s Wife,” Who’s most celebrated installment of last year. It was a special point of pride for the writer, considering Gaiman watched the show as a child.
And that’s what’s so special about Doctor Who. It’s now been around so long that many of those most recently responsible for it — Davies, Tennant, Moffat and Gaiman, at least — were fans themselves, inspired by the very series they now get to work on. With creative forces working to ignite in viewers the same passion they once had for the Doctor’s adventures, there’s no reason the TARDIS can’t keep flying for generations to come.
New episodes of Doctor Who air on BBC America on Saturdays at 9:00 p.m. PST.

In the last decade, the occult, the paranormal and an overall curiosity about the unknown have been on an upward trend that has been widely reflected throughout film and television.

With shows such as Ghost Hunters and A Haunting as well as films such as Insidious, The Innkeepers and the Paranormal Activity franchise dominating the pop culture scene, many entertainment seekers have become infatuated with the possibility that there is something superhuman and very dark lurking in every corner of their homes.
Here in Los Angeles, the ghostly trend is currently spreading from screen to stage as Zombie Joe’s Underground Theatre in North Hollywood celebrates its 20th anniversary season with the world premiere of award-winning writer Thomas J. Misuraca’s original spin on the paranormal frenzy The Para  Abnormals. Zombie Joe, the owner of Zombie Joe’s Underground, describes The Para Abnormals as a “supernatural thriller-comedy about three enterprising friends who venture into the hazardous world of ghost hunting.”
Misuraca was originally inspired to write The Para Abnormals in 2009 when his vampire parody, Lifestyles of the Damned, was published and he had been watching the TV series, Ghost Hunters.
“I loved the idea of blending comedy and drama, and I wanted my next original novel to be in a similar vein,” said Misuraca. “[The paranormal investigators on Ghost Hunters are] always so surprised when they hear a noise, you’d think they weren’t making a living out of this. So, the idea of amateurs starting their own paranormal team sounded like a fun one to explore.”
Misuraca immediately got to work transcribing the idea into a book, but he didn’t start out with much faith in the project.
“I wrote a good portion of the novel while Lifestyles of the Damned was premiering,” he said. “And not that I would consider that experience a failure, but it was anticlimactic. I worked very hard on the book [Lifestyles of the Damned] and not much happened after it got published. It made me not want to spend another two years writing and polishing The Para Abnormals.”
Around that same time, Misuraca’s career as a playwright was taking off. Though his biggest claim to fame was in the comedy genre, he was no stranger to writing horror. After his monologue, Haunted, won audience favorite in drama at North Hollywood’s MonoSlam at the Secret Rose, Misuraca was ready to further explore the horror genre — specifically the paranormal realm.
Simply being at Zombie Joe’s Underground is an experience in and of itself. In the black box theater, the entire room is dark — only a couple blue lights and a single candle illuminate the minimal set as the eerie sounds of industrial music fill the room.
But the atmosphere is a bit misleading. Unfortunately, The Para Abnormals tagline, “You’ll laugh! You’ll scream! You’ll laugh again!” is only half right.
The Para Abnormals, with a relatively short runtime of approximately one hour, transforms what could have been a straight-forward plot into a layered, chaotic muck. For example, there is a vague and unnecessary exposition of Jill’s (Jessica Amal Rice) haunting childhood. A back-story on a character is fine, but only if time allows for a thorough telling of the back-story.
But what caused even more confusion were the constant character changes. With Steve (Tucker Matthews) possessing Chuck (Tucker Matthews) and Chuck possessing the eccentric psychic, Chai Tea (Lauren Parkinson), it was difficult to keep up with who was who at times. You might even leave the theatre unsure of who you are.
The main characters make up the basic comedy trio formula of a bossy girl, her spineless boyfriend and the chubby sidekick whose sole purpose is comic relief. But the main character issue is with the ghosts. When the lighting was dim enough, they appeared as believable as any ghost encountered on the silver screen. With all the lights on, however, their stiff, hobbling body movements were illuminated and they were more believable as blood-spattered zombies than spirits.
The dialogue throughout the play, although intelligent and witty, was often delivered at an unnecessarily high volume. The stage and rows of chairs are confined within near-claustrophobic quarters, and the loud voice projection from the actors sometimes gave the impression that they were either shouting at the audience or at each other.
Despite the play’s failure as a horror production, it succeeds as a comedy, as it pokes fun at virtually every aspect of what you can expect to see in paranormal films and television programs. From familiar bodily noises suspected to be the sounds of the dead to Chai Tea’s wacky costumes and over-dramatic outbursts, The Para Abnormals will indeed make you shriek, but with laughter.
On the subject of Hollywood’s paranormal trend, Misuraca said, “I believe that the simple answer is that people like to have their emotions evoked. And horror, done well, brings out a great emotional response.”
Unfortunately, The Para Abnormals only tickled a funny bone.
If you are curious to see The Para Abnormals for yourself, head to Zombie Joe’s Underground in North Hollywood. The show runs every Saturday at 8:30 p.m. until Sept. 29.

It’s not unusual to walk out of a movie with the melody of a film score stuck in your head.
The man involved in many of these instrumentals  is Tom Boyd, a USC alumnus who has become one of the most well-known oboe players in the world. His playing is featured in a staggering 1,400 movie tracks, including Forrest Gump, Indiana Jones, Titanic and, most recently, Big Miracle.
Dreams fulfilled · As a young music student, Tom Boyd attended The Juilliard School and USC before beginning a career as a Hollywood oboist. – | Photo courtesy of Hollywood Soloists
By performing in a program of movie music with an ensemble of five musicians, called the Hollywood Soloists, Boyd has managed to bring cinematic music out of the studios and into the public eye.
Boyd, along with Sandy Hughes, Steve Dress, Bryan Pezzone and Patricia Garvey-Rynearson, will perform myriad classic compositions such as E.T., Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather and Star Wars, at USC’s United University Church on Saturday at 3 p.m.
“We bring the cinematic melody out into the public so that they can actually say, ‘Wow, this is really cool,’” Boyd said. “People don’t realize the impact that music has on their inner soul.”
Boyd began his music career as a clarinet player in elementary school, which led to him volunteering to play the oboe for a school concert.
“Extroverted Tommy raised his hand and said that he would take the instrument home to practice and learn all of the fingering for the oboe,” Boyd said.
As a 15-year-old L.A. native, Boyd played in community orchestras in Brentwood, eventually getting accepted to study at The Juilliard School in New York. He dreamed of performing in an orchestra and had no hesitation when he began auditioning. In 1972, Boyd arrived at USC.
After attending USC for one year, Boyd acquired the principal oboe position in The Honolulu Symphony,  leaving college just one semester shy of graduation. He played there for a decade, surfing during the day and donning a suit to perform at night. He then returned to Los Angeles, and by the time he was 31 years old, he had played in  his first feature film, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.
“Music is so important to a movie because, without it, there is no tension, no anticipation and no emotions that come to the surface,” Boyd said. “All you’re seeing are some very famous actors act really well, but the emotional impact is created by the music.”
Recording a composition for a film is a long process, but one that Boyd enjoys. The film to be scored is often shown out of context, starting with the end credits and moving onto the middle part — or vice versa. There are times when Boyd does not even realize the extent of the role he plays in the film’s score.
“When I see it in the movie theater, I realize that I was the lead guy that played all of these songs for this movie,” he said.
Yet even after the launch of his career, Boyd remembers the school that supported him and takes time to give back to the USC film scoring students and department with constant encouragement.
Salpy Kerkonian, USC alumna and organizer of the concert, describes Boyd as a genuine motivational force.
“He’s an amazing USC success story. He’s very dedicated and encourages the young composers and film scoring graduates from USC because he knows that they are going to keep music alive,” Kerkonian said.
Perhaps most crucially, Boyd simply wants young adults to share the passion and enormous joy he receives from music.
“Music brings a lot of excitement to the table,” Boyd said. “I want students to realize this when they come to the concert.”

An exploration of identity comes to campus in the traveling exhibit “A Complex Weave: Women and Identity in Contemporary Art,” now on display until Dec. 1 at the USC Fisher Museum of Art.
A woman’s perspective · “A Complex Weave: Women and Identity in Contemporary Art,” now on display at the USC Fisher Museum of Art, features the diverse works of 16 different female artists. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Inspired by feminist art, the exhibit brings together more than 40 works by 16 women artists to “throw some additional light on the complex weave of gender and identity in contemporary art,” said co-curator Martin Rosenberg, professor of art history at Rutgers University.
Nearly three years old, the exhibit, curated by Rosenberg and Dr. J. Susan Isaacs, professor of art history at Towson University, arrived at USC through the services of Curatorial Assistance, a company that manages traveling  exhibitions worldwide.
The unique variety of works focus on topics of ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, culture, geography and religion. The intricate connections between these facets of identity are shown through film photography, video production, sculpture, embroidery, installation and metalwork. Displayed together, they carry strong messages for the global feminist movement of today.
The exhibit also showcases the diversity of the artists themselves.
“It’s a women-embrace-art kind of showcase,” Fisher’s Education and Programs Coordinator Vanessa Jorion said. “There are no two artists who really come from the same place. You have everything from Chinese, Japanese, Moroccan, New Yorker and religious-wise — Orthodox Jewish and Hindu from India. It’s all about how these women bring these aspects of identity to their art, how it’s woven together, united in a sense of not defining identity but how they showcase their identity.”
In “Angel Island Shhh,” Chinese-American artist Flo Oy Wong illustrates conflicted emotions of growing up in two different cultures through a mixed media of U.S. flags, rice sacks, sequins and thread. In her own distinctive style, Moroccan artist Lalla Essaydi captures the complex reality of the Arab female identity through Islamic calligraphy with representations of the female body.
The exhibit also illustrates how the extraordinary can, at times, emerge from the seemingly mundane.  African-American artist Sonya Clark’s “Curls,”
which features ceiling-high strands of curled hair  all made from interconnected black combs, dangles in a corner. On the wall opposite, Mexican-American artist Blanka Amezkua’s embroidery boldly stands out. Through a traditional “female” craft, Amezkua shatters the images of passive women drawn in the comic books of her childhood, reconstructing them as defiant and physically strong.
“Even though the works are done by women artists, everyone can appreciate it because we all associate with identity,” Jorion said. “You can walk away with a little appreciation and enlightenment. There’s something for everyone to connect with.”
The 16 featured artists include Amezkua, Clark, Oy Wong, Sarah Amos, Helène Aylon, Siona Benjamin, Zoë Charlton, Annet Couwenberg, Essaydi, Judy Gelles, Sharon Harper, Julie Harris, Fujiko Isomura, Tatiana Parcero, Philemona Williamson and April Wood.

During the 2008 presidential election, thousands of college students campaigned for then-Sen. Barack Obama and showed their support at the polls in record numbers. Obama won more than 66 percent of the youth vote  — the largest disparity between youth voters and other age groups since exit polling began in 1972.
In 2008, Obama was touted as the savior  for the withering American economy. Unemployment stood at 6.8 percent and optimism in the American economy had dwindled. “Hope” and “change” were the words that captured the minds of young voters.
Yet as the 2012 presidential election approaches, unemployment hovers at 8 percent. The U.S. gross domestic product has grown only 7.7 percent over the last four years, and trust in the government continues to fall. It is time for the American youth voting population to elect a president whose platform pays attention to these problems and how they affect young voters by electing Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Among Romney’s pledges to reinvigorate the American economy and create job growth is a reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent, which will encourage companies to remain in the United States, ultimately creating more jobs by reducing outsourcing.
This reduction in corporate taxes will also allow companies to create more initiatives for college students and graduates through internship programs, coverage of graduate school tuition and training programs.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than half of all Americans are employed by companies with fewer than 500 employees. It is important to recognize that focusing on stimulating job growth in big corporations is clearly not what the country needs. Romney plans to concentrate the focus where it should be: the local level.
Through returning control of retraining programs to states, programs can be better tailored to the job needs of individual states and communities. These specified retraining programs don’t only help the currently unemployed, though  — they will also help recent college graduates find jobs.
But for long-term insurance to put the economy and country back on track, a greater emphasis must be placed on improving the education system in the United States. Romney believes that education reform should occur at all levels.
While he was governor of Massachusetts, public school students scored the best in reading and math in the nation. He is also in favor of providing students with greater access to charter schools, which will prevent high-achieving students from having to attend underperforming schools.
For students still attending underperforming public schools, though,  awarding achievement scholarships by school rather than on a state or national level provides them the equal opportunities they deserve. While governor, Romney proposed the John and Abigail Adams scholarship, which provides Massachusetts public school students who score in the top 25th percentile of their school free tuition to any public college.
With a better-educated population, Americans will be more competitive in the global job market and their skills will more accurately reflect those in current demand.
American youth have the opportunity to once again greatly influence the 2012 election. They should do so, however, with an understanding that the economic situation has not substantially improved over the last four years and college affordability continues to wither.
We, as students and already or soon-to-be members of the work force, cannot afford four more years of stagnant economic growth. It is time for the American youth to make a lasting impact on the American economy and education system by electing Romney.

The problem is the same that it has always been for Republicans: they don’t take arithmetic seriously. They want to lower taxes, close several unspecified ‘loopholes’ which they refuse to name, and then refuse to be exact on all of the social programs they want to cut. Rather than balancing the budget on the back of the middle class, perhaps a balanced approach with some tax rises and targeting spending on corporate welfare and subsidies is the place to start. They’ll be pain to go around because of the Bush recession, but I think Obama has values closer to a sense of fairness than Romney ever would.
It is interesting to check the differences between obama’s and romney sponsors… if you check, obama is pretty much sponsored by important universities, while romney is sponsored by dark companies..
check obama’s http://clnk.me/1wOvE.
,and romney’s http://clnk.me/1wEaE ,, contributors..
and then see the differenceI know obama will not be the best… but… at least there are no dark interest behind him and he promotes national products
neither..

The Millennial generation tends to vote Democrat, but voting along party lines is not why college students should vote to  re-elect President Barack Obama this November.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
The Democratic Party platform, ratified Tuesday, consists of policies that will serve to benefit young Americans. If re-elected, Obama will help college students by reducing the cost of higher education and continuing to fix the economy to provide more jobs for recent graduates.
Democrats have already worked to reform the federal student loan program by removing private banks from the equation, saving an estimated $60 billion that would have otherwise gone to banks for acting as needless middlemen. More than half of this money went to the Federal Pell Grant Program, which provides need-based scholarships to low-income students. Coupled with other federal funding, the money available for Pell Grant scholarships will more than double and will raise the maximum aid that students can receive.
On the other hand, the Washington Post reported that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said, “We’ve always encouraged young people — take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business.”
While some people are lucky enough to get that help from their parents, about two-thirds of college students have student loans from outside their immediate families.
Obama himself took out student loans that took years to pay off. Romney had an easier time repaying his debts, selling off some investments while he was in grad school.
Romney is simply out of touch. The Republican platform depicts a party that is more interested in using federal funds to decrease federal spending rather than to lower the cost of college.
Obama also plans to set aside $8 billion for community colleges, a vital part of the American education system and an appealing option for students who want to save money in their first two years of pursuing a four-year degree. This won’t affect students already at USC, but many future Trojans are currently enrolled in community colleges. According to the USC Office of Admissions, the university enrolled almost 1,500 transfer students last year, 59 percent of whom came from a California community college.
Additionally, the myth of Republican fiscal prosperity needs to be laid to rest. Former President George W. Bush’s last term in office was characterized by a spiraling economy sunk by a housing bubble and giant debt from expanding the military-industrial complex.
With a job stimulus pushed through in Obama’s first year in office, the economy has been slowly but steadily recovering. In the past 29 consecutive months of job growth, 4.5 million jobs have been added to the private sector.
By ending the war in Iraq and working to end the War in Afghanistan, Obama has also saved thousands of American lives and billions of dollars in military spending. Last year, Congress estimated that the Iraq War cost about $800 billion and the War in Afghanistan cost about $450 billion. Ending the War in Afghanistan, which Obama plans to do by 2014, would also significantly save the country’s funds for future generations in addition to saving the lives of American soldiers.
Obama has kept the Great Recession from becoming a second full-on depression, and a second term will allow him to focus on building a strong economy for the long-term.
Another element of the Democratic platform that could ultimately have a beneficial effect on young American’s lives is Obamacare. Obamacare allows children to stay on their parents’ health care plan until age 26, which extends coverage for about 2.5 million people. Romney’s pledge to repeal Obamacare would only hurt those just exiting college who might not yet have a job with health insurance.
As several fact-checking organizations have noted, such as PolitiFact and FactCheck, the Republican National Convention speeches were rife with blatant lies about Obama’s last four years in office. The facts are simple: Obama is the nominee who has already made concrete changes to help young people, and believable promises to improve our future.

This article was unfortunate. I know the DT tries to maintain a balance, but it can do better than Rachel. Let’s get someone in here who actually can debate a point.
Extremely one sided article, but I guess that is why it is in the opinion section. Here is the factcheck from Biden Obama speeches.

Freshman wide receiver Darreus Rogers has been cleared by the NCAA to officially join USC’s football team.
Rogers announced the news on his Twitter account Thursday afternoon. The four-star recruit from Carson, Calif. had been waiting on his academic status for a number of months and was unable to take part in any of fall camp as he anticipated word from the NCAA Eligibility Center.
With the Trojans still limited to 75 scholarships for the season, it is unknown what head coach Lane Kiffin plans to do with Rogers. The Trojans recently reassembled their scholarships after the additions of junior running back Silas Redd and redshirt junior linebacker Simione Vehikite, and it doesn’t appear that they have any slots available for the freshman wide receiver.
Kiffin has yet to publicly weigh in on the news of Rogers being reinstated to the team, but a number of possibilities still exist. USC could bring him in as a walk-on or shift scholarships around so he obtains one. There’s also a chance that the Trojans have a completely different plan in mind, as Kiffin and the athletic department have remained mum on the issue for the most part. Regardless of the outcome, Rogers is likely a redshirt candidate after missing both camps and the first weeks of the regular season.
Rogers played for Carson High School in 2011, obtaining a number of awards in his senior season including Super Prep All-American. He accumulated 1,251 yards and 10 touchdowns on 64 receptions. Rivals.com ranked him as the 29th best player at his position.

English indie-pop group The xx made their sophomore album Coexist available for streaming this week through a website created in collaboration with Microsoft.
While it is not uncommon for musical artists to release an online stream in advance of an album’s official release date, the website launched by The xx adds an extra level of interactivity to the process by allowing users to track the share history of the album as it is sent from user to user across the globe.
The website displays a world map with the user’s location marked by a small x, and a scrollable timeline on the right side of the page allows users to navigate to specific times since the launch of the website to chart the album’s course around the world. Glowing blue dots on the map represent listeners and at each point on the timeline curves connect those dots, beginning with a tweet, e-mail or Facebook post of the album stream and ending with the location of a new listener.
According to Pitchfork, the band launched the global sharing of the stream with one of their dedicated fans and let it spread from there.
Coexist is now available for pre-order at http://thexx.info/ and will be officially released on Sept. 11.

As college freshmen, the image of the first day of school is etched hauntingly into our minds. We return from a short expanse of time called summer, and are instantly catapulted into a world of homework, lectures and projects.
As much as we complain about the workload and lament the summer days gone by, this attitude only obstructs the mindset necessary for post-secondary education. It may seem overwhelming, but when professors set their expectations high in the first week of school it is for our own good.
Before college, the first day, or even week, of school was always devoted to reiterating classroom expectations or the dated first-grade practice of exchanging names and other trivial pleasantries. This made sense back when school was for learning to read, socialize and follow rules.
In college, however, we have more work to do and less time to do it. We also have a narrow window to decide whether we like a class or not. Wasting time reading a syllabus, which we are completely capable of reading ourselves, is counterproductive.
It is a choice and a privilege to come to college, especially a prestigious university like USC. When we agreed to come here, we knew what we were signing on for. Most of us only have four short years to find ourselves, learn a lot of information and leave. We have no time to waste on the first day of class; the professor should start teaching immediately.
It seems an anathema for any college student to desire more work, but college is meant to prepare us for a career by helping us develop a skill set that is desirable to potential employers. After college you don’t get time to settle in, you get jolted into reality from day one.
It might be painful for the unprepared student, professor or TA, but utilizing the first day as one to learn and study is an advantage that students attending a private university, especially one as expensive as USC, cannot afford to ignore.

The NCAA is launching a second investigation into allegations that former USC running back Joe McKnight and USC basketball player Davon Jefferson received improper benefits while playing for the Trojans.
On Saturday, the Los Angeles Times reported that Scott Schenter gave thousands of dollars worth of perks to McKnight and Jefferson while they were still enrolled at USC—including cash, a plane ticket from Los Angeles to New Orleans in May of 2008 and a Chevrolet Monte Carlo in 2009. Schenter is currently part of the ongoing corruption scandal in the Los Angeles County assessor’s office.
When asked by the Times about the incident, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said the school had notified the NCAA about the claims immediately after they were first revealed. Haden said the school would closely investigate the claims and take any necessary actions after the recent report surfaced.
USC head coach Lane Kiffin and senior quarterback Matt Barkley said that the Trojans would not be distracted by the allegations against McKnight, instead focusing their attention on their upcoming game against Syracuse on Saturday.
Jefferson, who played for the Trojans in 2007 and 2008, is currently a member of BC Triumph Lyubertsky in Russia. McKnight, a member of the NFL’s New York Jets, competed for USC from 2007 to 2009. Due to the NCAA’s four-year statute of limitations, if the allegations prove to be accurate, USC, who is currently on NCAA probation for violations involving former running back Reggie Bush and former shooting guard O.J. Mayo, would face additional penalties.
