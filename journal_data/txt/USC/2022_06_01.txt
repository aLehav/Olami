The 2022-2023 Undergraduate Student Government budget presented in a virtual senate meeting Tuesday night included a proposal for the reallocation of money from the green engagement and accessibility funds to the legislative fund and the prioritization of cultural assemblies. USG members also voted to restructure the judicial branch and communications department.
Newly established in Spring 2022 to provide financial support for sustainability and environmental justice student programs, initiatives and projects, the Green Engagement Fund will be cut alongside the Accessibility Fund if the budget is approved. At the end of the 2021-2022 school year, both funds remained mostly untouched. Funds will instead be reallocated to the legislative fund, which is available for use by USG senators and committees, including the committees for sustainability and accessibility.
Chief financial officer Brian Stowe, who led the budget creation, said one of the senate’s top priorities last year was sustainability, and the reallocation will help fund projects for senators passionate about sustainability and green engagement. 
Stowe also said the change will ultimately improve the efficiency of the funding process for sustainability projects, with more funds at disposal and “multiple people advocating for” projects.
“The reason this funding is being moved is because it does offer more flexibility and also offers the potential to have more funding for green engagement, and so having it on the legislative side also brings in more senators to know about green engagement and to advocate for it,” Stowe said. “I was on the senate last year, along with several other people [who are] very interested in advocacy. The Green Engagement Fund was unknown for a long period of time.”
Connor Castillo, the codirector of the Environmental Student Assembly and a rising sophomore majoring in environmental studies, raised his concern about cutting the Green Engagement Fund, as he said sustainability is one of the University’s chief goals. He said the fund’s recent establishment and the long-term nature of the projects it intends to sponsor makes judging its viability premature. Castillo also argued the Green Engagement Fund supports a unique kind of advocacy.
“There are other sustainability projects or issues that those senators could tackle that aren’t related to the Green Engagement Fund, which is really just there to enable individual students to create creative and innovative projects from campus using whatever background they come from,” Castillo said.
Vice president Nivea Krishnan noted that the reallocation of the green engagement and accessibility funds to legislative funds was also intended to turn focus toward issues that may not receive as much attention as sustainability and accessibility, which already benefit from the support of several campus groups.
The senate also discussed how the new budget addressed earlier concerns about inadequate funding from registered student organizations. Stowe said many of the issues have to do with organization and leadership. He said USG is working on measures such as avoiding funding directors “shifting through,” and regulating response times from the funding department so that every RSO should hear back about their funding status within 48 hours.
“A lot of this is going to come down to communication and just making it easier to apply for funds,” Stowe said. 
The budget creation process spanned many months. Stowe and other USG members met and discussed with every group requesting funding from USG. The budget also makes several cultural assemblies a priority, recognizing these groups frequently organize successful events and are continuing to expand. 
“Those are our biggest assemblies; they have the some of the biggest events that we have within programming, and just this upcoming year, one of the assemblies brought forward that their student population is growing and that their budget should be reflective of that because alongside the cost of inflation, if a larger percentage of student population is being now represented by that assembly, then it’s their responsibility to put on more events and put on microprogramming in accordance with that,” said chief programming officer Jillian Fallon in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
USG also voted on nominations to the programming department committees, unanimously confirming them. Fallon said she worked with former chief programming officer Jessica Minsol Kim, cabinet members and graduate advisors to conduct the interview process and selection of committee directors, while the assemblies voted for their respective directors. 
The programming department aims to increase the collaboration between committees, organizations and assemblies in the upcoming year. 
“The goal of the programming department this year is not just to grow our connections within programming but to grow them across student government and within programming, that’s emphasizing a lot of collaboration within our organizations, our committees and assemblies,” Fallon said. “Within all of the committee interviews that we held, a lot of the candidates really communicated that, and they presented a lot of really interesting ideas about ways that they can work with other committees and assemblies.”
USG also approved an amendment clarifying term limits for judicial branch stipended positions, resolving a previous discrepancy. Stipended judicial officers will serve lifetime terms on the condition that they are not graduated, impeached, resigned or unenrolled. 
Other constitutional amendments restructured the judicial branch — reducing the number of election commissioners from seven to five — and cut the operations team of the communications department, incorporating its duties into the other four teams: creative, digital, media and public relations.
USG struck down a bylaw amendment seeking to implement a switch from plurality voting to ranked choice voting. Ranked choice voting would ensure a candidate would not win without a majority voting for them, an event that has occurred in the past, said parliamentary secretary David Martinez.
“Ranked choice voting allows for the election of a presidential ticket by a majority of voters whereas the plurality voting system means that it’s possible to win without a majority of votes,” Martinez said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Senators expressed concern, however, that ranked choice voting would be more confusing for voters, and that not enough strategies for voter outreach and education were in place to support the shift.
USG will hold one more meeting virtually over the summer before resuming in August for Fall 2022 and will continue to discuss the budget.

I’ve always hated the phrase “just friends” and how it implies that friendship is somehow inferior to “romantic” love. The ancient Greeks actually distinguished four types of love: eros (romantic, erotic love), philia (love of friends and equals), storge (love of parents for children) and agape (love of mankind). However, while love comes in many forms even outside what the Greeks defined it as, eros has come to largely dominate our imagination as the standard of love. 
Just ask yourself: When was the last time you talked about your love for your parents with your friends? Now, when was the last time you talked about that horrible Tinder date you went on? Or your dining hall crush? We even have an Instagram account called “USC Missed Connections” for people to post about their campus crushes. 
Romantic love as a human emotion has been around since time immemorial. Our ancestors have probably felt the same dopamine, oxytocin, norepinephrine and all the other chemicals that our brain releases to give us the giddy and euphoric feeling we describe as being “in love.” While the feeling of romantic love may be similar across time and place, the narrative surrounding love has always shifted to reflect the economy and culture of the times. 
Throughout most of human history, love and marriage have been interlinked even though this connection came from mere coincidence. Many marriages in the past were appointed by the elders in the families and the young newlyweds did not have a say whatsoever in their marriage. 
This practice is still prevalent in many parts of the world today, wherein love only comes after marriage, as a product of convenience or luck. These cases don’t come into the center of our attention because they don’t fit the predominant narratives around love and marriage in Western culture. Just ask your grandparents about their love story and you will most likely not find yourself in total agreement with it, just like how they are likely not to approve of the hookup or dating app culture of our generation.
To borrow the words of New Yorker writer Alexandra Schwartz, whether it is the “monogamy of the booming postwar” ’50s, the “free love” of the ’60s, or the “greed is good” ’80s, society’s obsession with romantic love has not ceased no matter how the narratives around it changed in the modern era. In the capitalist, consumerist era of our own, love is forever for sale, and dating is what closes the deal. We turn ourselves into commodities, only drifting into long-term commitments reluctantly, perhaps in pursuance of the standing social norm of settling down and getting married. Dating is a social engineering tool that our society uses to bend us to fit its romantic design.
However, with same sex couples’ rights being increasingly recognized (although the battle is far from over) and new forms of love being introduced to the public imagination, such as love between humans and artificial intelligence, as depicted in movies such as “Her” (2013) or “Blade Runner 2049” (2017), our definition of love is already beginning to expand. We need to remember that romantic love and the forms we traditionally associate it with, such as monogamy and heterosexuality, occupy only a very small segment of that special emotion of love. 
With the vast majority of Gen Z today not wanting to get married, the shift away from romantic love is already beginning. According to statistics from the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics, only one in six people today believe in “the one” and one in seven people will be living alone by 2039.
So the next time you are questioning the whole obsession with dating culture and feeling like, “Oh man, this really is a lot of work” (particularly for women) — all that grooming, exercising, primping and courting, alongside other tangible investments such as money and mental health — remember that it is okay to not be a part of that culture, and remind yourself of your love for your friends, family, pets or even your Siri. Hey, that’s okay too.

If you’re like me and you would do anything for Andy Samberg, then you probably found yourself watching “Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers.” Going into watching it, I wasn’t quite sure whether I should have high expectations or not: The only bits of knowledge I had were that it starred John Mulaney and Andy Samberg and a single clip they showed on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 
Since 1988’s “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,” many movies have employed the technique of combining animated characters with live-action scenes and actors. One of the most notable examples of this is “Space Jam” (1996), which may not be the greatest cinematic achievement but is a whole lot of fun. However, after the disaster of a sequel that was “Space Jam: A New Legacy” (2021), I’ve grown very weary of any Roger Rabbit-type movies. 
I know people were already concerned about “Space Jam 2,” but honestly, I was hopeful that it would be a good time. However, it could not have gone more wrong. The movie was almost unbearable, mostly for two reasons: It attempted to include too many modern references and relied much too heavily on nostalgia value. 
Modern references rarely work. To understand the harm of modern references, think of basically every single Netflix original teen movie that tries to incorporate social media. It’s horrible to watch, mostly because the references date the movie even before it comes out. Trends move quickly, and by the time a movie finishes its average six to 12 months of postproduction, the modern references feel as though they were ages away. 
However, while modern references simply lead to some cringeworthy moments, the true death of “Space Jam 2” was its desperation to fit as many references to other famous movies as possible. From “The Matrix” (1999) to the “Harry Potter” series and even “A Clockwork Orange” (1971), not a moment in the movie went by without a meta reference trying to be shoved down the audience’s throat. 
The thing is, the new “Chip ‘n Dale” basically did the exact same thing — it was full of famous characters and celebrity cameos — even Roger Rabbit himself made an appearance. Yet, “Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers” was good — like, actually good. Even if Andy Samberg wasn’t involved in the movie, I would still like it. 
So why did “Chip ‘n Dale” work but not “Space Jam 2?” Well, the answer is simple: “Chip ‘n Dale” did not take itself seriously. 
“Space Jam 2” tried to make a commentary on social media and algorithms … or at least that’s what I think they were trying to do. In comparison, “Chip ‘n Dale” was mostly a story about some silly chipmunks trying to save their friends from being bootlegged. Sure, if you really wanted to, you could pull out some themes of friendship, greed and loyalty. There are also some references to addiction and corruption, but overall, that is not the point of the movie. It’s just fun! And recently, not enough movies have just been fun. 
So, if you’re going to insist on making an intellectual property movie, please don’t make the enemy an allegory for the technology that is destroying the world, but instead, an angry mobster Peter Pan played by Gob Bluth (Will Arnett). That being said, Sweet Pete (the nickname for Peter Pan) still has some meaning — calling the pattern of Hollywood’s cruel treatment and discarding of child stars, something that happened to the real Peter Pan voice actor. 
Still, with the inclusion of “Ugly Sonic” — poking fun at the disgusting original mockup of Sonic for the 2020 movie “Sonic the Hedgehog,” “Chip ‘n Dale” keeps it fun and enjoyable — modern references, cameos and all.

There’s something timeless about “Saturday Night Live,” NBC’s Emmy Award-winning late-night comedy show, which specializes in sketch comedy, digital shorts and satirical news. Perhaps it’s the show’s longevity, since it’s been running for over four decades, marking this past season its 47th continuous year. 
It’s no secret that the beloved comedy television show began to falter in the eyes of fans in recent seasons; this is demonstrated best by season 46’s Rotten Tomatoes score of 70% and its accompanying audience score of 32%. Yet it appears the show is regaining its spark, one that was perhaps demolished by the easy comedy offered by the dramatic political world of Trump’s presidency. USA Today remarked that “[SNL’s] cast, though still large and unwieldy (with 15 regulars and six featured players), has rarely been so well deployed.” Simply put, season 47 put the historic show back on track for its true purpose: to achieve unique and solid comedy. 
Although the head writers remained stagnant from the previous season, with Michael Che, Colin Jost and Ken Sublette continuing to run the writers’ room and maintaining the traditional sketchwriting format, there were also some notable “new kids on the block.” 
Ten new writers joined the roster with talent from all corners of the comedy scope, including former writer for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” Mike DiCenzo and stand-up comedian Alex English. The most notable addition was the viral comedy team known as Please Don’t Destroy, which comprises John Higgins, Martin Herlihy and Ben Marshall. Preceding its time on “SNL,” the group specialized in creating videos with absurd premises with gradually rising stakes that bordered on an insane “resolution,” that were shared on social media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and Twitter. Some of their most successful video sketches include “Hard Seltzer,” which comments on the increase in hard seltzers available and their music video collaboration with Pete Davidson and Taylor Swift, “Three Sad Virgins (ft. Taylor Swift).”
This season also ushered in three new featured players to the cast: comedian and filmmaker Aristotle Athari, impressionist James Austin Johnson and surrealist comedian Sarah Sherman (also known by her stage name, Sarah Squirm). Although the returning cast members, such as Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon, continued to provide a reliable, hilarious backbone to the show, the new members were no strangers to stealing the spotlight more than enough times. Sherman excelled in her “Weekend Update,” flexing her stand-up comedy chops, in which she acted as a field correspondent but would often turn headlines on their head to poke fun at Colin Jost, all while donning a whimsical outfit. On the other end of the comedy spectrum, Johnson hit the ground running, appearing in the season’s first cold open with his stellar impression of Donald Trump. 
A significant component of the show, of course, is its celebrity hosts. This season featured stars from every walks of entertainment life, from Kim Kardashian to Ariana DeBose to Jerrod Carmichael. The guests that assisted in creating the strongest episodes include comedian John Mulaney, actor Jason Sudeikis, actor Simu Liu and artist Billie Eilish. 
On Mulaney’s episode, his monologue was deeply vulnerable yet funny, as he utilized material from his current tour, with the strongest sketches being his collaboration with Please Don’t Destroy with “Good Variant” and the musical-style sketch, “Subway Churro.” Sudeikis, an “SNL” alumni himself, killed in “Parent-Teacher Conference,” alongside cast members Kyle Mooney and Ego Nwodim. Liu, following his role in “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” was a natural in his hosting debut, shining particularly in “Karaoke All-Stars.” Perhaps the most shocking success, given her tendency to gravitate towards haunting melodies, was Billie Eilish; the most impressive sketch, highlighting both her musical and acting capabilities, featured an old Hollywood and holiday vibe, “Santa Song.”
Of course, the musical guests, the bi-appearance of a particular artist or band during the show act as a palette cleanser from the preceding and following comedic acts. Some of the strongest songs were from female artists. Host and musical guest extraordinaire Billie Eilish stunned audiences with her emotional performances of her songs “Happier Than Ever” and “Male Fantasy,” Taylor Swift gave an emotional rendition of “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version) (10 Minute Version),” and The Bleachers, with music genius Jack Antonoff, returned with songs “How Dare You Want More” and “Chinatown.” However, one of the strongest aesthetic performances was demonstrated with Arcade Fire, which featured gas station inflatable dancers. 
The season was the final one for many stellar cast members. The last episode featured many send-offs to exiting actors: Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney and Pete Davidson. McKinnon reprised her role as alien abductee Colleen Rafferty in “Close Encounters” during the show’s cold open. However, at the end of the sketch, she joined the extraterrestrial life, teary-eyed while bidding her farewells to the audience. Davidson chose to close his tenure out on “Weekend Update” as himself, giving a sincere thanks to the show, saying “I appreciate SNL for always having my back, for allowing me to work on myself and grow.” Similarly, Bryant took to the “Weekend Update” desk with fellow cast member Bowen Yang as trend forecasters. She ended the segment with goodbye pecks to Che and Yang. However, Mooney did not receive the same treatment during the show but was featured in a handful of sketches.  
Season 47 was fresh, finally returning to meet the show’s long-standing standards. After years of politically-heavy content that more often than not drew strictly from actual events rather than finding the satire in them (given the fact that life at times felt satirical), “SNL” returned to its lighthearted, escapist roots. Audiences were able to lose themselves into the late hours of the night and laugh, a necessary component to survive in these trying times. 
However, they did not fall short of social commentary, but achieved such in an original way. This past season was a hopeful gain in the comedy sphere and it is clear that SNL fans can once again be proud of their beloved show. Although this season saw the departure of several comedy giants, given the new members’ breakout performances throughout the year, the show is ensured to explore new faucets of comedy, dealing with politically charged, plain goofy and surrealist content.

The student-led Dialogue Society, a club centered on promoting wellness in communities founded in 1997 with chapters at UC Irvine and UCLA, welcomed its newest chapter at USC early last year. By then, the coronavirus pandemic was nearing its first anniversary; older adults, especially those in nursing facilities, were among the most vulnerable, and thus were forcibly isolated from others to prevent exposure to the virus. 
Until vaccines were approved and widely administered, the California Department of Public Health only allowed a designated “support person” to visit older adults in nursing facilities when deemed medically necessary. 
Saba Doustmohammadi, a 2022 graduate from the USC Keck School of Medicine with a master’s degree in public health, said she recognized a “great need” for senior outreach, given these restrictions and staff shortages in nursing facilities.
“We had many, many challenges: reaching the [older adult] population, keeping them engaged — especially with technology being a weak point for our seniors,” Doustmohammadi said. “There was nobody that could really help everyone stay engaged, especially for the seniors that had to be completely isolated for much longer than everyone else was.”
Doustmohammadi had been involved with the UCLA chapter’s Senior Outreach Program; when she graduated from UCLA and began pursuing her master’s degree at USC, she decided to continue her work. She cofounded the USC chapter in the fall of 2021 with Yasmin Borhani, a graduate from the Rossier School of Education with a master’s degree in education. Borhani was previously the president of the UCI chapter.
“Different chapters have different focuses; for us, we really wanted it to be around the health and wellness of our seniors as well as our members,” said Doustmohammadi, who is now the president of the USC chapter.
What began as a small club supporting, and supported by, its sister chapters gradually developed into the separate but still collaborative, group it is today.
“We got to a point where it wasn’t [them supporting us],” Doustmohammadi said. “Now we’re supporting UCLA, for example, connecting them with some centers that we connected with … We’ve come a long way.”
So far, the USC chapter has held storytelling sessions, astronomy presentations, oral health workshops — in partnership with the ORBIT Club at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry — and donation drives — in partnership with the USC Advocates for Healthy Aging — at centers throughout Los Angeles, including Belmont Village and The Piedmont Senior Apartments. 
Lexi Jiao, the social coordinator of the USC chapter and a 2022 graduate with a master’s degree in aging services management, said the oral health workshop was her favorite event. 
“It was a good opportunity [for] potential dental students to show people how to take care of their oral hygiene,” Jiao said. “Everybody liked it and ORBIT prepared a little gift for the [older adults] and they really liked it. So it was really sweet.”
Events did not come without challenges, however. Jiao recalled one such example at a Storytelling session:
“There was this one [older adult] that might have been a little sensitive, but that’s really normal when you’re getting older,” Jiao said. “She wasn’t really comfortable with the questions we asked like, ‘What is your favorite book?’ I mean, it’s totally just like a normal question, but not her … Just different personalities and stuff. So that was one of our challenges, and we have her feedback that we will definitely think about, [as to] how we change our questions in the future.”
Regardless, events had net positive impacts on both members and seniors, said Misa Belser, vice president of the USC chapter, who graduated from UCLA majoring in molecular, cell and developmental biology.
“One of the main things we hear from the seniors is just being able to talk to us and to see our faces and to interact with us — that makes a huge difference in their lives,” Belser said. “Especially with the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s a lot of isolation and feelings of loneliness, especially within the senior community. So I think our events do a lot to combat that, and to help them feel more socially connected.”
Doustmohammadi also noted the positive feedback she received from older adults.
“Our seniors love us,” Doustmohammadi said. “We’ve had people come on and say it’s been the highlight of their week … Mid-event, [people are] like, ‘Okay, when is the next time you’re coming back?’ So it’s been well received, everything we’ve put together, whether it be online or in person.”
Belser said the chapter is planning new events to host in the upcoming semester, including nutrition workshops, music-related events and storytelling sessions held in other languages.
“This summer, we’re focusing more on holding more socials for our members,” Belser said. “It’s mostly just a time for us to destress and relax together. But we will spend some time planning our future events so that, when the academic year starts again, we will be prepared.”

In stride with the inaugural National Fentanyl Awareness Day taking place May 10, a team of USC students have been distributing fentanyl testing strips to minimize the occurrence of drug overdoses in the University and greater Los Angeles community. 
Following the deaths of nine USC students, including a close friend, due to fentanyl and other drug poisonings, Team Awareness Combating Overdose was founded in 2020 by neuroscience students who felt moved to take action and inform the University community on the effects of the drug. 
Fentanyl is a highly addictive pharmaceutical opioid prescribed to treat severe pain, especially that which is linked with advanced cancer. However, most cases of harm and death from the drug in the United States take place when the drug is illegally made and mixed into heroin and cocaine, often when the user is unaware. Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine — the amount of fentanyl equal to a speck of dust could be lethal. In 2020, more than 50,000 individuals in the U.S. died from synthetic opioid poisoning from drugs such as fentanyl. 
In the cases of the nine deaths in 2020, fentanyl was present in at least three of the autopsy reports, and were determined to be accidental by the coroner. 
Much like a coronavirus or home pregnancy test, the fentanyl testing strips use a two-line system to distinguish between a positive or negative result. The strip is dipped into a mixture of one tablespoon of water and a strawberry seed-sized amount of a drug for 90 seconds. The strip will display a single line if fentanyl is detected, in which case the drug is considered lethal and the user should not ingest it. 
Along with the distribution of fentanyl strips, the organization has created multiple safety videos and infographics found for social media platforms, including Instagram, that aim to increase knowledge of drug addiction, dependency and overdose.
“Our job is to educate the naïve drug user,” said TACO’s interim chief operating officer Kameran Mody, a rising junior majoring in biomedical engineering. “Those happen to be primarily college students … Our job is to educate them, give out fentanyl test strips and provide information about the drug so they’re educated before they actually use them.”
When the project started in 2020, TACO set up twice-weekly distribution stands for the testing strips both on University Park Campus and on The Row to be given out to all in the USC community. Later on, the organization partnered with student-run delivery services, including Handle, Duffl and Snag, to distribute the strips, and is now affiliated with 11 schools across the U.S. To maximize accessibility, the strips can be ordered for one cent for community distribution if need is expressed.
“We never want an inability to pay to be a barrier to safety,” said director of distribution Max Reed, a 2022 graduate who majored in neuroscience.
The organization has seen “pretty crazy” growth in the demand for the fentanyl testing strips over the semesters it has been operational, Mody said. 
“We’ve gone from distributing around 200 or 200 fentanyl test strips a month, and now this semester we’ve got up to about 3,500 a month … it just goes to show what kind of impact it’s causing for the school.”

In a pregame press conference full of people who had dedicated their lives to covering basketball, Golden State Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr made it clear that talking sports was off the table. 
“I’m not going to talk about basketball,” Kerr said. “Any basketball questions don’t matter.” 
Kerr proceeded to deliver an impassioned three-minute message about the horrific tragedy that occurred in Uvalde, Tex. on Tuesday when an 18-year-old killed 21 people, including 19 children, in the second deadliest school shooting in United States history.
Kerr, who lost his father to gun violence when he was just 18 years old, was full of emotion as he pleaded with the leaders of our nation to respond appropriately to not just the massacre in Uvalde but also the hundreds of deadly shootings that preceded the event. 
“When are we going to do something?” Kerr yelled, hitting his hands on a table in frustration. “I’m so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out there. I’m tired of the moments of silence.”
Kerr’s frustration is shared by an overwhelming majority of the country. Nearly 90% of Americans support background checks for all gun purchases, yet bills that would establish expanded background checks have stalled in the Senate. 
After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, in which 26 people were killed by a gunman, members of the Democratic party introduced a bill called H.R. 8. The bill, which would require background checks on all gun sales, was passed by the House of Representatives in 2021. Unfortunately, the bill is stuck on the Senate floor. 
“There’s 50 senators right now who refuse to vote on H.R. 8 … and there’s a reason they won’t vote on it: to hold on to power,” Kerr said.  
The National Rifle Association has its hand deep inside the pants of the Republican party since forming its own political action committee in 1977. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, around 24 Republican senators have received contributions from the NRA. Of those, 16 senators have received over $1 million. 
Mitt Romney, a Republican senator who has received over $13 million from the NRA, tweeted on Tuesday, “I offer prayer and condolence but know that it is grossly inadequate. We must find answers.” 
Prayers and condolences are indeed grossly inadequate, but so has been the United States’ response to gun violence in this country. People die every day from gun violence. The problem is plaguing the country and elected officials are cowering in their response. 
“Are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children?” Kerr said, addressing the same 50 senators who have let H.R. 8 gather dust as people are shot down daily. 
Speaking of inadequacy, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who last year signed into law a preposterous bill that restricts abortion access for women in the state, continues to outdo himself. Abbott will be delivering a pre-recorded speech for the 2022 annual NRA meeting in Houston on Friday. Former President Donald Trump will also be in attendance. This appalling timing has led many to demand the NRA cancel the event. They won’t. 
Since Abbott took office in 2015, Texas has experienced six mass shootings; yet, the Republican governor has signed 22 pieces of legislation that make it easier to buy and carry a gun in Texas. With the NRA on his shoulder, Abbott has refused to even attempt to protect Texans from gun violence. 
Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke called Abbott out in a recent press conference. He was removed after criticizing Abbott’s passivity when it comes to gun laws. 
“These massacres are not natural disasters, acts of God or random,” O’Rourke said. “They are totally predictable, direct consequences of the choices made by Greg Abbott and the majority of those in the Texas legislature.” 
In response to calls for action, Uvalde County commissioner John Yeackle said, “This is not going to be the time to talk about gun policy … Right now, feelings are so raw.” 
When Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans in 2005, people didn’t wait until the grieving was over to help the community. That’s not how grieving works. On Tuesday, parents were forced to wait on DNA tests to confirm the loss of their children because the damage from the assault rifles rendered their babies unrecognizable. That’s a grieving process that never ends. 
“It’s so easy for young, mental kids to get guns and randomly shoot innocent victims,” said Lydia Martinez Delgado, whose niece was killed in the shooting, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “It shouldn’t have to be like this: teachers, parents and students afraid to go to school or send their kids to school.” 
When tragedy strikes, mourning is important but so is action. Steve Kerr, Beto O’Rourke and most importantly, family members of the dead children are calling for just that. 
“We can’t sit here and just read about it and go ‘Well, let’s have a moment of silence, yeah go Dubs. Come on Mavs,’” Kerr said. 
Kerr is right. We cannot numb ourselves to the everyday tragedies caused by gun violence in this country. Legislative action is more necessary than ever in order to prevent these senseless acts. Republican senators, and the few Democrats who accept money from the NRA, aren’t sneaky. It’s abundantly clear why they refuse to enact change, and as Kerr put it: “It’s pathetic. I’ve had enough.”

Men’s tennis sent three players to compete in the NCAA Tournament in both singles and doubles beginning May 23. USC’s season officially ended two days later when No. 7-ranked junior Stefan Dostanic suffered a loss in the round of 16.
Dostanic, alongside freshman Peter Makk and senior Bradley Frye, represented the Trojans in individual competition. He registered wins over Mississippi State graduate student Florian Broska and Georgia senior Philip Henning in the rounds of 64 and 32, respectively. 
It took a 3-set match for Dostanic to take down Broska. After falling behind with a 4-6 loss in the first set, the junior rallied and took the final 2 sets 6-3, 6-2, to advance past the first round. He took the next matchup against Henning in 2 sets, 7-5, 6-3, before falling in the round of 16 to conference foe Stanford sophomore Arthur Fery in 2 sets, 6-2, 6-3. 
“[Dostanic] had expectations of winning and getting that wildcard in the U.S. Open,” Head Coach Brett Masi said. “He was playing really well all season long. He just didn’t have his A-game this tournament, unfortunately.”
Makk was one of few freshmen competing in singles. His run ended after a first-round loss at the hands of Virginia sophomore Iñaki Montes de la Torre in 2 sets, 6-3, 6-1. Montes de la Torre went on to make the quarterfinals. 
“[Makk is] one of a select few [freshmen who] can say he was there doing that,” Masi said. “[I’m] very proud of him and his efforts this entire season.”
Frye teamed up with Dostanic in doubles, marking their debut together in the NCAA tournament. The duo was defeated in the first round by Wake Forest pair graduate student Jakob Schnaitter and senior Siddhant Banthia. Frye and Dostanic took the first set, 6-3, but dropped the final 2 sets, 7-6(7),10-5. 
The Trojans’ team campaign ended May 14 with a 4-2 round-of-16 loss to Ohio State in NCAA Tournament team play. USC was short-manned, as Makk missed the match due to health and safety protocols. Ranked No. 13 going into the tournament, Masi said the team had greater aspirations than their result. 
“Being at USC, your expectation is always to win the Pac-12 and to compete for the national title,” Masi said. “We had sets in almost every match … competing for a chance to win. I can’t ask for much more than that … I thought we did have a team that could win it all, but we just fell a little short. ” 
With many new faces on the roster to start the season, the team grew with the experience and competition of the season.  
“We just got a lot more mature [this season],” Masi said. “There was a lot to learn about the culture, about how college tennis works … and what [we want] our identity to be.” 
According to Masi, the Trojans will return the entirety of this year’s starting squad for next season. 
“It’s monstrous — to not lose anybody from your core group and to potentially bring another huge addition to the squad — this team’s only gonna be better for it,” Masi said. “The rest of the country better be ready for the Trojans.”

Last Thursday, the No. 19 women’s tennis season reached game, set and match.
USC’s remaining players lost in the NCAA singles tournament, effectively ending the season. After falling in the second round of the NCAA Tournament in early May, USC had two participants in the singles tournament — junior Eryn Cayetano made her debut and senior Salma Ewing participated for the second consecutive year. 
Ewing fell 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (6) in the Round of 16 last Wednesday to No. 26 Connie Ma from Stanford. Cayetano’s season ended with a 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 quarterfinal loss the next day to No. 2 Peyton Stearns from the University of Texas.  
Cayetano led the Trojans with 39 wins in singles play. The junior was also ranked the No. 1 singles player in the country in December 2021 — the first USC player since Sabrina Santamaria in September 2013. 
Along with Ewing, Cayetano earned All-Pac-12 First Team honors. Both also earned ITA All-American honors. 
“Eryn had a breakthrough season,” said Head Coach Alison Swain in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It really started off with her putting in a lot of effort this past summer… [39] is just an absurd number of singles wins.” 
Losing in the Round of 16 concludes Ewing’s strong career at USC. As a junior and senior, she was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team. She received All-Pac-12 Second Team honors after a 19-win singles freshman season. Due to the coronavirus, there were no Pac-12 honors in 2020. 
Ewing evolved into an important vocal leader this season, Swain said. 
“She has so much experience playing at the top of our lineup all four years and she’s had huge highlights along the way,” Swain said. “Salma’s improvement over four years … really showed up this year in big moments and how she handled those big, high-pressure moments from a mental standpoint.” 
No. 50 Ewing and No. 7 Cayetano had contrasting roads through the rounds of 64 and 32 competitions.  
Cayetano defeated No. 29 Rebeka Mertena 6-1, 6-7(0), 6-3, then took down No. 65 Bunyawi Thamchaiwat in straight sets. It set up a matchup with No. 43 Mariia Kozyreva, who Cayetano outdueled in a 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals. 
Unlike Cayetano, Ewing’s matches in the round of 64 and 32 were straight-set victories. She defeated No. 54 Victoria Hu 6-1, 6-4 then Veronika Miroshnichenko 7-5, 6-4 for a spot in the Round of 16. 
The Trojans’ season ends with an 18-12 overall record and a second-round appearance in the NCAA Tournament.
