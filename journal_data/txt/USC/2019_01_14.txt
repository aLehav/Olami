After starting conference play with back-to-back convincing wins at the Galen Center, a brutal Oregon trip leaves the Trojans at one of their lowest points of the season. Just three days after losing in overtime to Oregon State, the Trojans suffered a demoralizing 81-60 loss at Oregon on Sunday night.
The Trojans entered the game missing star freshman Kevin Porter Jr., who, after finally returning from a thigh bruise that kept him out 10 games, faced a team suspension. According to a USC spokesperson, Porter Jr. was suspended by head coach Andy Enfield for “conduct issues” that occured between Thursday’s loss to Oregon State and tipoff on Sunday. His situation will be re-evaluated upon the team’s return to campus.
Coming into the game, the Trojans had defeated Oregon in their last three meetings. Poor rebounding and shooting from USC stopped the streak from growing past there. The Trojans shot just 5-for-18 from deep and got outrebounded 31-to-22.
Junior guard Jonah Mathews has been one of the lone threats from deep lately, hitting 15 of his 31 shots from beyond-the-arc in Pac-12 play. However, the team hasn’t followed in Mathews’ tracks: Excluding the contributions of Mathews, USC has shot just 8-for-42 from deep since entering conference play.
Oregon head coach Dana Altman recognized the recent shooting funk of USC and dared the Trojans to shoot throughout the night, by sitting his team back in a 2-3 defense. Enfield employed the same daring tactic, but Oregon responded by shooting 54 percent from deep, hitting a season-high 13 three-pointers.
The shooting from deep was just one of the many storylines of a game between teams heading in vastly different directions.
Both teams suffered hard fought defeats in their last outings and both teams served as prime examples of how a team usually starts a game after such a loss. Oregon came out with something to prove, taking a 12-4 lead in the game’s first four minutes. USC on the other hand came out lackadaisical, making just two of its first ten shots.
Junior forward Nick Rakocevic had a career week to kick off conference play, averaging 25 points and earning Pac-12 player of the week. However, the last week of play has been the polar opposite for Pac-12 rebound leader. After scoring 50 points in USC’s two Pac-12 wins, Rakocevic scored just 17 in the last two games, stripping USC of a previously reliable offensive weapon for much of the night. 
Senior forward Bennie Boatwright played an efficient game, but the Trojans needed more than a good shot percentage and 13 points. Boatwright’s heroic 37-point effort from Thursday night seemed to halt his aggression against the Ducks, as he attempted just nine shots in a game where the Trojans were searching for any signs of offense.
A Boatwright and-one late in the first half capped an 8-2 USC run and brought the Trojans with 7 points at 28-21, but a personal 5-0 run from Oregon freshman forward Louis King halted the lone example of momentum the Trojans had mustered. King combined with redshirt senior forward Paul White to score a combined 28 first half points, as much as the Trojans had all together going into halftime. 
Both King and White had career nights, as White tied a career-high 19 points while King followed up his best game of the season against UCLA with an equally impressive performance against USC, totaling 19 points, 8 rebounds and a career-high 6 assists.
The Trojans will look to bounce back from a tough week on Saturday at 1 p.m. as they take on UCLA at the Galen Center.

When USC landed Kliff Kingsbury as its offensive coordinator, it was seen as a coup for a struggling program that was searching not only for an upgrade on its coaching staff but also a public relations boost. He was anointed the savior, the reason to have hope entering the 2019 season. His addition even temporarily quieted the many critics of USC’s decision to retain head coach Clay Helton. 
But last Tuesday, Kingsbury spurned the Trojans in favor of a NFL head coaching job with the Arizona Cardinals, bringing forth two absurd realities: the fascination in the professional ranks with finding the next Sean McVay (the Los Angeles Rams head coach) and just how far down the abyss USC has fallen. 
A few months ago, Kingsbury was fired at Texas Tech, where he amassed a 35-40 record over six seasons. And yet, he was the hottest commodity on the market. Even after USC reeled him in, teams kept calling. He reportedly turned down a head coaching offer at Houston. But he could not turn down the NFL. He interviewed with the New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals before ultimately being offered the gig with the latter.
Why the sudden influx in attention for a coach with a sub.-500 record? It could be because Kingsbury, 39, is young and in the mold of the offensive-minded, new-fangled coaches who have taken over the league, such as McVay and San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan. The Cardinals, in fact, made sure to mention in their press release that Kingsbury was friends with McVay, as if being linked to the Rams coach was an automatic qualification to coach in today’s NFL.
Make no mistake, this is a risky hire, just like McVay was when the Rams hired him in 2017 as the youngest coach in the NFL. Kingsbury has no experience running a defense and could easily be overwhelmed by the job. But to the Cardinals, the risk is worth it, and this move makes the trend clear: the NFL has become obsessed with finding the next young, bright offensive mind. 
This spells disaster for USC. The Kingsbury hire was almost universally praised. He was exactly the man Helton needed to turn the ship around on a program coming off a 5-7 season. There was hope that, with Kingsbury implementing his pass-heavy Air Raid offense, quarterback JT Daniels would have a breakout sophomore season and the talent the Trojans have at wide receiver would finally live up to its potential. 
Instead, USC was — for lack of a better word — played. Almost immediately following Kingsbury’s hiring, USC started advertising season tickets with the coach’s picture. All that excitement is now gone, and the school is now stuck with an unpopular head coach while Athletic Director Lynn Swann is left scratching his head, owing an explanation as to what the hell happened.
In many ways, this episode epitomizes the state of the USC football program. Sure, nobody expected Kingsbury to receive so much interest from the NFL so soon. But for a reported $150,000 buyout, Swann lost his prized asset. It doesn’t matter if you blame Kingsbury for being disloyal: USC was unprepared and caught off guard. 
This is what happens when a program needs its most prized asset more than the asset needs it, when an assistant coach is more valuable than the head coach. Kingsbury held all the leverage throughout the whole process. Swann was left with an empty hand, and now USC, already dealing with the repercussions of a 5-7 season that has resulted in an apathetic fanbase, is back to the drawing board. 
It is ironic, this saga. Critics went after USC all season for having a head coach they perceived was in over his head. So USC went out and brought in an A-plus assistant, only to find out that Kingsbury was so overqualified that he was NFL-head-coach material. 
Cruel? Yes. But fitting? Absolutely. 
All of this could have been avoided had USC simply fired Helton, cleaned house and started anew, hiring a fresh, innovative head coach like … oh, I don’t know, Kliff Kingsbury? But USC attempted to patch deep wounds by applying a Band-Aid, which ripped off immediately. Even in the best-case scenario, Kingsbury would have fixed the Trojans’ offense and then left for a head coaching job after next season. 
Instead, the worst-case scenario — no Kingsbury at all — was what they got. And it was what they deserved.

After winning 10 of its first 11 games, the USC women’s basketball team started conference play 0-5 after losing to both No. 5 Oregon and No. 10 Oregon State this past weekend at the Galen Center. The Women of Troy continued to struggle against ranked teams, coming off losses to No. 6 Stanford and No. 18 Cal last week. 
On Friday night, the Trojans fell to the 15-1 Oregon Ducks 93-53. The Ducks, who are averaging over 90 points per game, have been a powerhouse all season. The Women of Troy got off to a shaky start in the first quarter, giving up 21 points while scoring only 9. Turnovers were a major problem in the second quarter,  as the Trojans had 11 turnovers to the Ducks’ two. In addition, USC went 2-of-11 from the field and 0-of-4 from behind the arc.
USC entered the second half already down by 23 points, trailing 41-18. Even though the Women of Troy nearly matched their first half scoring output in the third quarter with 16 points, the Ducks countered with 29. Oregon finished its night scoring at least 20 points in every quarter. USC finished with only 16 field goals compared to the Ducks’ 34.
“[Like always], we came in with the same positivity, but we did not come into today’s game with the same heart,” junior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley said.
Ducks sophomore forward Satou Sabally led all players with 26 points scored and five 3-pointers. Senior guard Aliyah Mazyck led the Trojans with 16 points, going 6-6 at the free throw line. 
Sunday’s 76-52 loss to the 14-2 Oregon State Beavers marked USC’s fifth-straight defeat. Junior guard Minyon Moore led the Trojans with 6 first quarter points, while Beaver freshman guard Aleah Goodman kicked off the Beavers’ hot start with three straight 3-pointers. At the end of the first quarter, Oregon State led 19-13 after shooting 64 percent from the field. 
Moore was the leading scorer for the USC in the first half with 10 points. Mazyck added 6 of her own, while freshman forward Jillian Archer also contributed down low, scoring one basket in the paint and hitting two free throws.
In the second quarter, senior guard Mariya Moore got on the board as the Women of Troy sought to penetrate the interior, after going 0-7 from beyond the arc. The Beavers cooled off from 3-point land as well, while the offensive presence from the Trojans helped trim the lead to 29-27 with five minutes left in the second quarter. Despite shooting only 3-of-15 from inside the paint, USC’s inside attack led to success at the charity stripe, where the Women of Troy shot 11-of-12 in the quarter and 14-of-16 in the game.
USC also forced six steals in the first half, part of the Beavers’ 13 turnovers. However, Goodman extended the lead for the Beavers with her fourth 3-pointer. Oregon State led at the half 34-29.
At the beginning of third quarter, USC cut the lead to 2 with their first 3-pointer of the game from Mazyck. However, head coach Mark Trakh was forced to call a timeout halfway through the third after Oregon State scored 5 straight points.
“We stall. If you don’t score and the other team gets 10 points that’s a 10-0 run,” Trakh said. 
The Beavers continued to dominate in the third, holding the Trojans to only three field goals in the quarter. The Beavers finished on a 24-7 run, entering the fourth quarter with a 58-36 lead. USC’s shooting percentage lowered to 17 percent in the third quarter, and 22 percent for the game. 
“We just petition to the NCAA that we want to start in the fourth quarter…” Trakh said of improving third quarter performance. “It comes down to knocking down shots.” 
USC turned to a full court press and an intense zone defense in the final quarter, but couldn’t erase the Beavers’ double-digit lead as Oregon State emerged victorious.
“We’re not done,” Trakh said. “People thinking we’re going to fold our tents. We’re not. We’re going to work even harder to get this thing turned around.”
Minyon Moore finished the game with 21 points, adding two rebounds and two assists. For the Beavers, junior guard Mikayla Pivec finished with 21 points and seven rebounds.
The Women of Troy head to Westwood to play crosstown rival UCLA Sunday at 4 p.m.

Gone are the days when the Trojans could easily run laps around Pac-12 rivals, especially for local recruits. USC has gained prominence at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana and Junipero Serra in Gardena, locking up diminutive four-star cornerback Max Williams from the latter school. 
But Southern California native Kayvon Thibodeaux, the No. 1 edge recruit, and four-star Mater Dei inside linebacker Mase Funa both signed with Oregon, marking a huge loss for the Trojans’ local presence.
USC typically dominates Pac-12 recruitment, boasting a top-five class nationally in three of the past four years and the top Pac-12 class for the past five years. But after its Early Signing Day period, recruitment for the Trojans could be impacted by former offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury’s departure from USC, after he was hired as head coach of the Arizona Cardinals. 
However, USC successfully signed five-star Bru McCoy, another one of freshman quarterback JT Daniels’ targets at Mater Dei. He is listed as an “athlete” but is expected to slide in at receiver. He could also see action at outside linebacker for the Trojans in the coming season. 
McCoy was expected to sign with USC, so it was not a particular feat, but the hard commit of five-star wide receiver Kyle Ford was a significant triumph, shooting the Trojans up the Pac-12 rankings. McCoy and Ford are big physical receivers, standing at around 6-foot-2 and weighing around 212 pounds.
Unfortunately, pass catcher is not a position of need for the Trojans, with solid wide receivers already at the program in freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown, junior Michael Pittman Jr., redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and redshirt sophomore Velus Jones Jr. However, McCoy and Ford will add value to the already deep receiving corps with big bodies and strength in the red zone. 
Ben Griffiths, an under-the-radar signing, could fill a position of need that often goes overshadowed by the flashier skill players–punter. The Australian will look to fill a major role on a special teams unit that did no favors for an already struggling offense and lagging defense. The coaching staff will be looking to target more positions of need for National Signing Day.
In addition, the coaching staff is heavily targeting four-stars Noa Pola-Gates, a tall cornerback from Arizona, and Enokk Vimahi, a guard from Hawaii. Signing Pola-Gates would be a huge win, as USC lacks depth at the position, but 247 Sports has it lower on the list of his options, listing Nebraska as the favorites to sign him.
Additionally, the Trojans are looking at Matthew Pola-Mao to fill the defensive tackle vacancy. Offensive tackle Dawand Jones is also a target, but USC is an underdog for his commitment; according to 247 Sports, Ohio State is Jones’ most likely destination.
The 2019 class is currently shaping up, but it is still weaker than in past years at No. 13 ranking. The SEC once again dominates the recruiting rankings currently with four of the top five classes and the Trojans aren’t helping to dethrone the SEC with turmoil in the coaching staff and inconsistent on-field play. 
Kingsbury was supposed to be the great beacon of hope for the Trojans’ underperforming offense, and his cool charisma gave the program a brief resurgence. But his departure has hurt the Trojans’ chances at landing their recruiting targets and moving into the top-five class.

On Friday, Netflix debuted its brand new original series, “Sex Education,” and it immediately cemented itself as the perfect coming-of-age show for today’s sexually liberated crop of teenagers. The series chronicles the awkward Otis Milburn, son of a relationship and sex therapist, and his unlikely friendship with Maeve Wiley, a classic high school rebel with a penchant for trouble and flipping people off. Together, they form an underground sex counseling enterprise for their peers.
The show’s ingenuity stems from its characters and the way they interact with and complement each other. Otis is a relatable protagonist — he’s sexually insecure and unpopular, which makes him the ideal lens through which viewers can experience the spectacle that is high school dating. His best friend, Eric Effoing, adds humor and vibrancy to the show by acting as a foil to Otis. Maeve is another foil to Otis: her bold and independent persona is reminiscent of Alyssa from Netflix’s “The End of the F***ing World.” This pairing forms an enticing dynamic in the pilot, which sets up for a promising alliance moving forward. 
The pilot begins with a camera pan to a high school couple, Adam and Aimee, having sex. The realities of a typical teenage sexual encounter are evident in the scene:  it’s awkward, absurd and comical at times. But more importantly, it sets the tone for the rest of the episode and presents the show as a raw comedy-drama about adolescents and their budding sex lives.
The show deals with important issues concerning sex and the way it affects teenagers’ lives, cleverly tackling issues that range from slut-shaming and sexuality to family dynamics. “Sex Education” offers a glimpse into the lives of high schoolers and all the embarrassment, harassment and pressure they  endure, but it manages to keep an upbeat and lighthearted tone throughout. 
Not only are the content and themes of the show superb, but the cinematography also makes the series aesthetically pleasing to watch. The camera shots are enticing, presenting varying angles and zooms which direct the audience’s attention appropriately. Similarly, the vibrant colors of the characters’ clothing and their setting — breathtaking shots of lush forests and rivers — build the livelihood of the show. 
While the showrunners also make a concerted effort to include diverse characters, showcasing same-sex couples and people of color, they fell flat in their depiction of Adam, a typical bully who excuses his reprehensible behavior with lackluster stories and false claims of hardship. His character, and the existence of the “mean popular kids,” are the only aspects of the series which come dangerously close to cliché paradigms akin to shows about high school. Despite these shortcomings, “Sex Education” still maintains its originality with its biting humor, nuanced storylines  and multi-faceted characters, so it seems likely that these characters will continue to grow and offer a fresh take on overplayed archetypes. 
“Sex Education” systematically undoes and deconstructs the false narrative fed to typical viewers about teenage sex and sexuality. It is a modern-day take on sex and adolescence, highlighting  the fact that sex doesn’t always happen on a bed of roses and isn’t always satisfying for both partners. The show aims to destigmatize and normalize the teenage sexual experience in whatever form it presents itself — whether or not that is defined by virginity. Netflix’s latest British comedy contributes to and expands upon the relevant conversations teenagers are having about their bodies and sexual encounters, which shows a promising future for the show as a cultural linchpin.
