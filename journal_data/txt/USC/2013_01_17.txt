After several high-profile public safety incidents in 2012, newly appointed Dept. of Public Safety Chief John Thomas is inheriting a 280-member force that finds itself directly in the public eye.

Thomas assumed the position of chief over winter break, after former Chief Carey Drayton left the post to work as special assistant to Charles Lane, associate vice president of Career and Protective Services. Drayton left his DPS position after talking about exploring other opportunities, Lane said
“The position of Chief of the Dept. of Public Safety is extremely demanding,” Lane wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Carey Drayton was in the post for seven years and in recent years had expressed an interest in other opportunities.”
Drayton said he plans to remain in his new post, at least through the end of the spring semester, but is considering work in the private sector.
“For me, it is a great time to explore other professional opportunities, which may include work in the ever-growing private security sector,” Drayton wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I began working in campus law enforcement in 1980, serving students at premier institutions, and it is time to evaluate all my options as I look at the next couple of decades in my career.”
DPS was heavily involved in responding to several widely-reported incidents last year, including an off-campus shooting that fatally wounded two graduate students from China and an on-campus shooting in October that prompted new security measures, such as the implementation of fences around the perimeter of campus.
As chief, Thomas, who formerly worked at the Los Angeles Police Department, said his top priorities are to reduce crime and ensure that DPS functions professionally.
“In a nutshell, ensuring that our department is well-prepared [and] well-trained for responding to various types of situations,” Thomas said.
Because of the visibility that inherently comes with policing a bustling campus, Thomas said it is important that DPS treat people on campus respectfully.
“When people come to this campus, when they come to this community, we have an obligation in every aspect to make sure that we are representing the university in a manner consistent with the values of the university,” he said.
Despite DPS’ good reputation with other agencies such as the LAPD, Thomas stressed the importance of improving the department’s reputation among students, the community and regular visitors.
“I don’t think we’re horrible, but I do think we have a lot of work to do to enjoy the same type of reputation and respect that we enjoy among our law enforcement peers,” Thomas said.
Thomas said he hopes to improve DPS’ reputation by ensuring that interactions with officers are positive.
“There is no excuse for us, in the heat of whatever we’re engaged in, [to] become part of the problem by exacerbating the situation,” Thomas said. “Those days of responding out of emotion and out of bias -— those things are unacceptable to me.”
For Thomas, increased transparency is another  important step toward changing DPS’ perception among some members of the community.
“I want us to explain our actions to those that we encounter,” Thomas said. “And when we make mistakes — and we will make mistakes — I want us to apologize to people — unqualified apologies.”
Thomas also hopes to promote more collaboration between the community and students who live in the local area.
Thomas’ resume includes working as the adjutant to the LAPD chiefs William J. Bratton, Martin Pomeroy and Bernard C. Parks. Before coming to USC in 2006, Thomas served as deputy chief of police in the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Management at the University of the District of Columbia. In 2010, he helped oversee plans for President Barack Obama’s visit to USC.
Lane said Thomas, who grew up near USC, fit many criteria that the university was looking for in a new chief.
“He was a natural choice to become executive director and chief,” Lane said.
Drayton, in his new position, will help Thomas transition to the role of DPS chief, according to Lane.
@North University Park.  You guys are a bunch of drunks who play loud music and piss off the community around you.  No, the problem IS the row…
North University Park, your comment has stood without being deleted for almost 5 hours now, possibly a new record for race realism on the dailytrojan boards.
@ tfl
Lay off the crack!  NUP speaks volumes about the real problems around SC
Maybe try fighting real crime and not the row.  The row isn’t the problem,  the community is….
With all due respect, as a third generation Trojan (and Fighting Methodist) alumnus; I ask, “Are you kidding?”
The insular attitude of the current administration is starkly different from that of Dr. Sample, long-proven unsuccessful and all too familiar.
Get real!
Fight On!

The USC women’s basketball team was unable to continue its four-game winning streak Thursday night as it lost a tough game on the road against the No. 7 California Golden Bears, 71-63 in overtime. This was the Women of Troy’s fifth Pac-12 conference game and was also their first loss in Pac-12 conference play.
On fire · Sophomore guard Ariya Crook finished Thursday’s matchup with a team-high 21 points to go with five rebounds and four assists in USC’s 71-63 overtime loss against the No. 7 Cal Golden Bears. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (7-9, 4-1 Pac-12) had a six-point lead with 1:42 to play in regulation, but Cal rallied back to send the game into overtime. They outscored the Trojans 9-1 in the extra period to overcome the Women of Troy.
Sophomore guard Ariya Cook led the Trojans in scoring off the bench with 21 points, while junior forward Cassie Harberts added 15 points. Junior forward Kate Oliver recorded her second-straight double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.
“This was a really tough loss for us but I am really proud of our team for playing hard against a great Cal team, and we are just going to have to move on to the next one,” Harberts said.
Senior guard Layshia Clarendon led the Golden Bears (14-2, 4-1) with 27 points while adding six rebounds. Junior forward Gennifer Brandon dropped in 23 points of her own while contributing a career-high 26 rebounds. All six points to tie the game in the closing minutes of regulation were scored by Brandon, who also added a timely block to help send the game into overtime. With her performance on the boards, she was able to assist the Golden Bears in outrebounding the Trojans, 54-43.
Though USC barely outshot Cal, shooting 34.4 percent to the Golden Bears’ 31.4 percent, they were once again plagued by turnovers with 15. A contributing factor to this was the 11 steals racked up by the Golden Bears.
“We are going to need to play fundamentally sound basketball and avoid these two- to three-minute lapses that we have should we want to continue to be successful in conference play,” Harberts said.
The Trojans controlled the tempo for much of the first 35 minutes, as they limited points in the paint and kept Cal off the boards, but still trailed at halftime 36-31. After being down by as much as six points, USC went on an 11-0 run to take a 46-41 lead early in the second half. A 3-pointer from Cook made it 58-53 with only 2:53 remaining, but Cal played well enough down the stretch to take the game into overtime.
The Women of Troy now move on to play at No. 6 Stanford, who faces off against UCLA on Friday. The Trojans will later return home beginning on Jan. 25 for a two-game home stand against the Arizona State Sun Devils (10-6, 2-2) and the Arizona Wildcats (10-5, 2-2).
Stay focused Women of Troy!!!
keep the faith TROJAN NATION.  This team can ball.  We should have closed out the bears.  Up 6 with 1:42 left,
ball control and getting your best FTers to the line is critical.  Stanford is a beast…….pray we can stay close
and win late.  I have faith our WOT will play well in Pac-12, and make a run in NCAA tourney.
Keep your heads up Ladies and lets FIGHT ON!!!
The problem with the head coach Cooper is no matter what he can’t win a big game against a top
ranked opponent at home or on the road. He also misses out on the best of the local talent. Gennifer
Brandon is from the SFV playing at Chatsworth High. Others have gone to U. Conn, ucla, and Texas lately.
 His supposedly great name recognition has proven to be worthless locally. Out of state recruits have been
 a big disappointment except for Kate Oliver who transferred from back east.

After opening its season on the road and coming away with a victory against defending NCAA champion UC Irvine, the USC men’s volleyball team returns to the Galen Center to host one of its biggest rivals.
Spiking it ·Junior Tanner Jansen finished with eight kills in USC’s straight-set victory over the top-ranked UC Irvine Anteaters on Jan. 11. He has 13 kills on the season entering Friday’s match against Stanford. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The No. 7 Trojans (1-1) will take on No. 2 Stanford on Friday night, facing off against a squad that has amassed a 4-0 record to begin the season.
“They’re a really skilled team,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “They’re going to want to get [Stanford middle blocker] Eric Mochalski the ball quite a bit. Brian Cook and Steven Irvin are two of their pin attackers, and those three are what really make them go.”
After being swept by UC San Diego in their opening match, the Trojans rebounded with an emphatic win over the Anteaters in straight sets (25-21, 25-23, 27-25). The victory not only enabled USC to earn its first win of the season but also allowed the team to avenge its tough loss at home to UCI in last year’s NCAA championship match.
Sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers shined on both sides of the court, registering a team-high 12 kills to go along with six blocks. Freshman outside hitter Alex Slaught and redshirt junior opposite Tanner Jansen each notched eight kills to pace the Trojan attack alongside Feathers, while the defense was anchored by freshman libero Brooks Varni (eight digs) and sophomore setter Micah Christenson (seven digs).
“I liked that no one major stood out,” Ferguson said. “I thought everybody brought something to the table and it was a team victory. The thing that was very important to me was us responding to a bad loss and showing the perseverance to leave that behind and do well in the next match.”
Ferguson’s club is attempting to make up for the departures of two key players in the team’s 2012 championship run–outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, the 2012 national player of the year, and All-American middle blocker Steven Shandrick. The Trojan squad consists of 18 underclassmen; of the nine players to start in each of the team’s first two games, only one — opposite Tanner Jansen — holds junior status.
“We came out of our staff meeting wanting to make sure our guys were as professional as possible,” Ferguson said. “There are going to be some young guys who aren’t playing as much right now who need to be ready when their number is called. What we really want to see from our younger guys is how well they’re going to respond to adversity, because it’s going to come as the season progresses.”
Though Stanford poses a tough challenge, the key to success for the Trojans will be limiting the strong Cardinal attack.
“We’re going to expect to see a heavy load of Mochalski, Cook and Irvin. If we can hopefully alter or slow them down a little bit, we’ll have a better shot if we limit one or maybe even two of them,” Ferguson said.
Last season, the Trojans defeated the Cardinal in each of the teams’ two meetings, once in Palo Alto in February and again in a late season home game in March. In the first matchup, USC knocked off then-No. 1 ranked Stanford behind 12 kills from Jansen.  Senior opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin also chipped in 10 kills in the team’s 3-2 win.
In the second meeting, USC again outmatched its foe, this time more handily in a 3-1 win.  The Trojans’ defense was particularly strong, limiting the trio of Mochalski, Cook and Irvin to just 27 combined kills  The defense will have to contain those three again in order to improve their record to 2-1.
USC and Stanford are set to square off at 6 p.m. at the Galen Center.
Lets go & support our great men of Troy…..
beat the Farm.   I am so excited to see what Alex & Brooks bring to this tough match.
Fight ON!!
It’s a sweep! congrats guys!

It’s been more than two weeks since USC finished its disastrous 2012 season. But the news just keeps getting worse.
On Wednesday, ESPN Los Angeles reported that sources told them a fight took place after the Trojans lost to Georgia Tech 21-7 in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31. An anonymous player said the scene was “pure chaos,” though he didn’t see any actual fighting. Zach Banner, a reserve offensive lineman, told the Los Angeles Daily News, “It’s going to be a whole new family atmosphere next season, and you can quote me on that. For the seniors, it’s terrible.”
According to the article, the supposed brawl (which USC coach Lane Kiffin has denied) happened because a player had been badmouthing senior quarterback Matt Barkley and his role as a leader. Other seniors, including senior safety T.J. McDonald, reportedly took exception to the claims. Though what went on in the locker room after the loss isn’t clear, there is one thing that is certain: The team was a mess by the end of the season, and a lack of leadership was supremely evident.
Say what you will about Barkley’s senior season, but it’s becoming clear that this team was out of control and that not even he could put the pieces back together. The thing this team lacked in 2012 was leadership. We all thought it was Barkley leading the way, but it appears that not everyone thought so.
Sure, Kiffin probably shouldn’t call plays. But there are several players on this team who need to step up and lead USC out of the shadow of this awful season. With the departure of every single team captain (Barkley, McDonald, senior center Khaled Holmes and junior cornerback Nickell Robey), an encouraging locker room atmosphere could make or break the Trojans in 2013.
On the offense, players such as junior running back Silas Redd and sophomore receiver Marqise Lee need to step up. It’s clear that Lee is the best player on the team and among the best in the country, but his frustration was evident at times this season. As the team’s premier player, he needs to be the guy younger players can look to as a role model.
Redd, on the other hand, is one of the more mature players on the team. His even-keeled demeanor needs to rub off on other players who might not take things in stride as well as he does. He will be a senior, and though he has only been on campus for a season, what he experienced at Penn State during the child sex abuse scandal and the way he handled himself in his subsequent departure to USC should allow him to handle anything.
Defensively, there will be an almost entirely new unit starting in the secondary. The linebackers are the veteran presences on the team, with each having started the last two seasons. Sophomores Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard need to take charge and hold their teammates accountable, something that didn’t seem to happen this past season.
Perhaps the difference in the 2011 and 2012 Trojans was leadership. The players were the same, for the most part. In fact, most of them got better. A player like former offensive tackle Matt Kalil might have kept a powerful presence in the locker room. Or perhaps it was former tight end Rhett Ellison who kept things in line.
I can only speculate, though; I’m not in the USC locker room. But there was something noticeably different in the Trojans this year. They didn’t show the same resiliency they did when they finished No. 6 in the Associated Press poll in 2011. And though a lot of it probably falls on Kiffin, even more of the blame falls on the team leaders and the fact that there wasn’t anyone there to motivate others when they needed it most. I can say this for certain: The 2011 Trojans would never have lost five of their last six games. The leaders wouldn’t have allowed it.
Locker room fights happen all the time. But the way in which this one seems to have unfolded, behind questions of the star player’s leadership, is unacceptable. The heart of a leader should never have to be questioned. A subpar season is the only thing that can come of a situation like that.
I support both the AD and Head Coach, even though they beat my alma mater, Syracuse University. The article is right in that Team Player Leadership seemed lacking. The AD and HC can say anything they want BUT they do not play the Game. Only the Players can do that.
It’s becoming clearer each day that Pat Haden is not up to his job as AD.  His main failure is in refusing to fire Lane Kiffin, who lacks the integrity, honesty, character, leadership and ability to lead USC’s football team.  Haden is acting in a classic passive agressive way by firing the basketball coach when his ire — as with most USC alumni — should be squarely focused on Lane Kiffin.  Haden has ignored all of Kiffin’s shameful tactics (changing jerseys, deflating footballs, refusing to let other teams preview the field, disrespecting the Sun Bowl host city, allowing the team members to lose self-control, etc.).  Accordingly, it’s time to fire Pat Haden.  Haden, for all of his achievements, lacks the courage, strength and wisdom to do the right thing.  Haden is simply too weak to fill the role of AD.

Multiple media reports confirmed Thursday that the USC football program plans to fill its defensive coordinator spot with former Cal Golden Bears defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast.
The university will announce the hiring of Pendergast on Friday, according to CBS Sports.
A USC spokesman declined comment on the reports.
Pendergast is an accomplished coach, with experience in both college and professional football. He was most recently the defensive coordinator at Cal, a position he held for the last three years. He was ousted as part of a major coaching haul at the end of this past season after the Golden Bears finished a disappointing 3-9. Before that, Pendergast served as the defensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals from 2004-09, helping the Cardinals reach the Super Bowl in 2009.
Pendergast also holds a connection with USC, as he spent one year as a defensive assistant for the Trojans in 1992. He’s an alumnus of another Pac-12 school, the University of Arizona.
Changes coming · The 2012-13 USC Trojans allowed 24.3 points per game under former coordinator Monte Kiffin, ranking 40th in the country. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The Trojans had been searching for a new defensive coordinator after Monte Kiffin resigned amid rampant criticism regarding the Trojan’s subpar defensive season. The Trojans’ struggles were highlighted this season against the Oregon Ducks, as the defense gave up 62 points and more than 700 yards of total offense.
Pendergast’s hiring should bring a major overhaul to the Trojans’ defense, including a  potential change of scheme from a 4-3 to a 3-4 system. Pendergast has utilized the 3-4, which uses an extra linebacker, throughout his career. At Cal, that defensive scheme once held the fast-paced Oregon offense to 15 points in 2010. The Bears led the Pac-12 in total defense for the first two years of Pendergast’s tenure.
The Trojans were also reportedly interested in Oregon Ducks defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti, but sources told The Oregonian that Aliotti declined USC’s offer to join the staff.

Prior to Thursday night’s game against Oregon, USC interim coach Bob Cantu hinted at making changes — both in terms of personnel and philosophy. In his second career game as a head coach after serving 12 years as an assistant coach for USC men’s basketball (7-11, 2-3), Cantu adjusted USC’s lineup rotations and spurred the team to quicken its offensive tempo.
Not quite enough · Junior guard J.T. Terrell finished with 22 points on 6-12 shooting, including 4-9 on three-point attempts. He was the leading scorer in USC’s 76-74 defeat against the Oregon Ducks. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately for USC, the high-flying Ducks spoiled Cantu’s return to head coaching, edging out the Trojans 76-74 in the final moments and winning their fourth consecutive game to open Pac-12 play. No. 21 Oregon’s well-balanced, versatile attack, which features five starters who average double-digit points, proved too much for USC in the end.
Oregon led comfortably throughout the first half, stretching its lead to as many as 10 points midway through the period before settling with a 35-31 lead at halftime after senior  Renaldo Woolridge fouled Oregon forward Carlos Emory on his last-second desperation 3-point heave. Emory would convert two of his three free throws to taint what had been a strong comeback effort for USC.
The Trojans hung on, however, on the strength of junior guard J.T. Terrell’s 15-point first half, which included three 3-pointers.
The second half featured more of the same, with both teams exchanging baskets at a fairly even clip. With 33 seconds remaining, USC drew to within one point after Terrell made two free throws. Following freshman guard Chass Bryan’s intentional foul on Oregon freshman guard Dominic Artis, the Ducks expanded their lead to 76-74 after Artis front-rimmed the first attempt and made the second.
After the ensuing timeout, senior guard Jio Fontan pulled up for a final 3-pointer that rattled around the rim before bouncing out. Both redshirt junior forward Dewayne Dedmon and senior forward Eric Wise had chances at put-back layups but came up empty-handed. Oregon finally corralled the last rebound with one second remaining, sealing the victory.
Despite the hard-luck loss, USC exhibited a scoring punch that has been absent in many games thus far. Much of that can be attributed to the sweet-shooting Terrell, whose frequently dubious shot selections earlier in the season often frustrated former USC coach Kevin O’Neill.
Upon learning of O’Neill’s firing, many figured that Terrell would be the biggest beneficiary of Cantu’s vow to reassess all players on the roster. Making his second consecutive start after an efficient 14-point performance in Saturday’s 76-59 win at Utah, Terrell finished with 22 points on 50 percent shooting, putting forth a convincing case that he deserves a reprieve from the doghouse in which he has spent most of the season.
USC returns to the Galen Center Saturday for a 5 p.m. game against Oregon State.

Though the box office can be pretty unpredictable, there are some basic elements that go into anticipating how well a film is going to do.
The Governator · Arnold Schwarzenegger is back — in his first starring role in a decade as a sheriff of a small town in The Last Stand. – Courtesy of Warner Bros.
 
Some factors include: how other films have done recently, what weekend a film is coming out and what competition it faces.
This column will look at these elements to predict what films will come out on top over the weekend. Though this column is beginning in the traditionally quiet month of January, which is usually reserved for December leftovers, Oscar contenders and the occasional breakout, it’s still a pretty exciting time at the movie theater, especially since some really cool and interesting movies coming up on the horizon.
The Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend has been a good launching pad for the box office in the past. This weekend we see Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first lead role in a decade in The Last Stand, the political drama-thriller Broken City, the Guillermo del Toro-produced horror flick Mama and the wide-release expansion of the Oscar-nominated Silver Linings Playbook.
Waiting in the wings this weekend is Mama, a new horror film from Guillermo del Toro starring Jessica Chastain — the current frontrunner for Best Actress for her performance in Zero Dark Thirty, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, better known as Jaime Lannister from HBO’s Game of Thrones. Despite del Toro’s accolades, attaching his name to a film hasn’t really done much for a film’s success, with films such as Splice and Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark  performing poorly. Mama does have a good amount of buzz, though, and the fact that it’s PG-13 means that teenagers who normally would not be able to go see such a horror movie can do so. It’s curious, though, that they haven’t really emphasized Chastain’s role in the film; it’s not every day a new horror film has a potential Oscar winner in the cast. She’s not easily recognized, though, since she’s sporting a black pixie cut. Despite that, it’s a PG-13 horror film, which is something that’s never good to underestimate, especially with a four-day weekend where teenagers have the day off. Expect a gross of $19.5 million for the three-day and $22.3 million for the four-day.
While the former governor and USC honorary professor has had his fair share of controversy since the end of his political tenure, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s newest film, where he stars as the sheriff of a small Texan town  battling Mexican cartels, comes in amid an action-star revival.
Thanks partly to The Expendables franchise, in which the Governator had a brief role, there’s a sense of nostalgia for some old-school, amoral, dumb and loud fun.  His fellow 1980s action stars, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis, both have new films coming out that are  going for the same shoot-‘em-up approach.  However, the advantage of The Last Stand has been its effective marketing campaign and the directing of Kim Jee-Woon, the Korean director of I Saw The Devil and The Good, The Bad, and The Weird.
Hurting its chances, though, is Broken City, a political thriller starring Russell Crowe and Mark Wahlberg. This time last year, Wahlberg was able to take Contraband to great numbers and overall, he’s been on a box office streak, especially with the surprise box office success of the summer, Ted. However, it’s attempting to be market itself as two things: a political drama and an action film.  Without anything to make it stand out, its best chance is winning over the R-rated audience that isn’t quite up for the violent romp that is The Last Stand.
The Last Stand, though, should end up with the greater revenue, with $16.5 million for the three-day, $18.9 million for the four-day. The great reviews for it so far should only help it in the long run. Broken City will get the leftover adults with $10.7 million for the three-day, $12.1 million for the four-day —  basically on par with State of Play, the 2009 political drama that also starred Russell Crowe.
Silver Linings Playbook expands wide and touts eight Oscar nominations, including nominations in every major category including best director for David O. Russell and all four acting nominations. Despite the awards buzz and the great performances from the entire cast, it just hasn’t been able to dramedies with audiences the way other indie romantic comedies have. The genre hasn’t done well at all lately, and that funk seems to be hurting the film’s box office numbers.
Nonetheless, this is the first film in more than 30 years to have nominations in every major category, which is definitely worth something. It’s the kind of film that couples can go to and the fact it does have some Oscar pedigree behind it should make it more enticing. Expect a $14.2 million three-day total and a $16.6 million four-day total.
So here’s how the weekend should turn out: Mama should capture the No. 1 spot for MLK weekend. In second place will likely be last week’s number one, Zero Dark Thirty, with a slight drop to $18.9 million for the three-day and $21.7 million for the whole weekend. When all’s said and done, the film could very well end up as the number one again. Running behind will be The Last Stand, followed by Silver Linings Playbook with Broken City in the fifth spot.

Though students nationwide welcome the reprieve from schoolwork that comes on the third Monday in January, the day stands for much more than just a break from school. Martin Luther King Jr. Day is dedicated to commemorating the vision of an equal America held by Martin Luther King Jr. and the strides he made in the 1960s toward achieving a society where black citizens received equal treatment.
During his lifetime, MLK was honored many times, most notably as Time’s Man of the Year in 1963 after he delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. He also became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Following his assassination, MLK was immortalized through his followers’ memories and commemorations. Twenty years later, a national holiday was created in his honor. Today, his achievements are recognized throughout the world.
To honor the man, his work and his legacy, there are several events taking place in Los Angeles this four-day weekend.
The annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day Parade is set to take place at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 19. This free annual festival runs from MLK Jr. Boulevard and Western Avenue throughout the city, ending on Vernon Avenue. The event will feature parades, live music and food.
Another local celebration, “Inspired By His Words,” is being held in MLK’s honor on Jan. 19 from 10 – 11:30 a.m. The event features music, dance and spoken word performances, along with displays of artwork inspired by the late activist. The free event will feature performances by the Lula Washington African Dance and Drum Ensemble, Heart of Los Angeles Music Ensemble, Bancroft Middle Schools’ Performing Arts Dance Academy and the Kid City South Park Big Band. The International House of Blues Foundation partnered with students and community members to make this event possible, which will take place at the House of Blues Sunset Strip (8430 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood).
For a more hands-on experience, consider volunteering at Belmont High School on Monday, Jan. 21. In honor of MLK, volunteers will spend a few hours painting educational murals, inspirational quotes and college logos at a high-needs school to make it a more interactive and engaging place for students to learn. Registration starts at 8:45 a.m. at Belmont High School (1575 W. 2nd St.), and will go until approximately 2 p.m. — free lunch will be provided.
MLK made an impact as a key leader of the civil rights movement who believed fervently in the efficacy of nonviolent protest. Through his incredible  leadership abilities and unerring devotion to his cause through nonviolent protest, thousands of black Americans and other minorities alike came to believe in MLK’s ideas and were inspired to fight for them alongside him in the ’60s.
Many would say his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, which he delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963, embodies what he stood for.
And as illustrated by the many events taking place in Los Angeles to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. this weekend, his words still resonate with listeners spanning generations  who  continue to build on that dream today.

In addition to its beaches, beautiful people and agreeable weather, Los Angeles has been making quite a name for itself lately in the constantly evolving, cut-throat world of restaurant industry. From Roy Choi, the founding father of commercial gourmet food trucks, to Bryant Ng, chef and owner of the wildly successful Spice Table in Little Tokyo, there is no end to the culinary talent that abounds in Los Angeles’ most revered dining hot spots.
dineLA Restaurant Week, which takes place Jan. 21 through Feb. 1, is a 12-day event in Los Angeles that promotes some of the city’s best restaurants. This week of eating and merriment started as a collaboration between the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board and American Express.
Taking notice of the epicurean boom that was occurring in Los Angeles, the partnership created dineLA Restaurant Week, a strategic marketing program to showcase and promote Los Angeles was one of the best cities for fine dining. The first dineLA featured 143 restaurants from all over Los Angeles. Nearly four years later, more than 250 restaurants participate in dineLA, from swanky jazz clubs like Vibrato Grill & Jazz in Bel-Air to the homier, more bohemian restaurants such as Grub in Hollywood.
But how exactly does dineLA work? In order to provide the most enjoyable dining experience, participating restaurants create specially priced, prix-fixe menus for customers. This way, diners don’t have to stress over what to order — all they need to do is pick one dish from the already narrowed-down choices for starters, entrées and desserts. The best part about dineLA? You get all this food at a price lower than what you would usually pay ordering on a normal, non-dineLA day.
However, to navigate dineLA successfully, one must keep a few rules in mind.
First, if possible, avoid the usual suspects such as grilled salmon and Jidori chicken, among others. Though a restaurant might prepare these common dishes brilliantly, dineLA should be a time to get adventurous and let your tastebuds run free. Hostaria del Piccolo in Santa Monica, for example, offers a unique squid ink taglioni served with shrimp and prepared with white wine.
Try to avoid salads. If you want to get the most out of your dineLA experience, watching your figure is out of the question. At ROFL Café in West Hollywood, diners can choose from one of the following as a first course: meatball bottino, mussels with hand-cut fries and the ROFL house salad. The salad might be a healthy option, but the bottino, with meatballs, fresh mozzarella and farm-fresh basil, or the mussels, savory and garnished with saffron onions and tomato-chile butter, are definitely the tastier options.
Don’t order the same thing as everyone else. Since you can’t try everything on the menu, have each person you go with order different combinations from the prix-fixe menu. Abigaile, an American brasserie in Hermosa Beach, offers up to 13 choices for each category and there is no end to how incredible each dish is. Banana curry scallops with mango chutney and coconut-peanut relish, roasted bone marrow with chimichurri, sea salt-and-confit garlic brioche toast and braised lamb-belly poutine with caramelized onions are just a few of the dishes Abigaile has to offer.
Finally, know what’s on the menu ahead of time. If you are a regular at a certain restaurant and plan on visiting that restaurant during dineLA week, prepare yourself for a very different menu. Restaurant Week is a chance for restaurants to experiment and change up their usual style, so plan accordingly.
There are, of course, the restaurants that cannot be overlooked. Rivera in Downtown offers exotic fusion dishes such as xochimilco, a chile-infused chocolate cake with creamy avocado mousse and drizzled with a zesty lime sauce. Meanwhile, Little Tokyo’s Aburiya Toranoko serves fresh, umami-packed dishes such as oysters with ponzu sauce and homemade yuzu sorbet, which makes for a light and satisfying lunch. For a heartier meal, Akasha in Culver City offers a dinner that includes aromatic saffron seafood risotto and pink peppercorn pavlova, a meringue dessert made of Greek yogurt, passionfruit curd and blood oranges. Then there’s the always crafty Bar and Kitchen on Flower Street in Downtown. Offering a $20 lunch, its prix-fixe menu boasts dishes such as parsnip and pear soup with crispy duck prosciutto as well as shrimp and grits with Spanish chorizo ragout.
Not all restaurants serve lunch and not all restaurants serve dinner, but in all cases, reservations are highly, highly recommended. If you plan on walking into a restaurant that participates in dineLA, be prepared to wait at least an hour.
Take these tips and suggestions to heart and dineLA will surely become your favorite time of year.

There’s no denying it: All around the world, the culture of nip and tuck is being cultivated, grown and blown up to epic proportions. A fascinating dichotomy arises, one where a plastic surgery culture of outer beauty and covetousness exists next to issues of insecurity about our frail bodies and an itching sense of dissatisfaction with how we look.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
 
In recent news, this infatuation with the plastic has taken Afghanistan by storm. Though most surgeries done back in the day were reconstructive — patch-ups for war injuries, medical treatment for cleft lips — things have taken a turn, shedding light on the fact that cosmetic surgery at large plays on the age-old ideologies of societal concepts of beauty.
In that sense, this growth of interest in plastic surgery on a global scale might not be an indicator of an increasingly image-obsessed society but a continuing symptom of a society that has always been this way.
In the spirit of being progressive, just because something has always been this way does not mean that it’s right. However, though critics of plastic surgery might poke at all the negative aspects of the industry, in the end, it’s the patients that have to live with the decision, and if happiness lies beyond that rainbow, it may just be enough.
In an article by The National, one patient, after undergoing nose enlargement surgery, said, “In Afghanistan, being beautiful means having big eyes and the right-size nose.” For her, it is a chance to feel good about her looks.
For others, surgery might mean a reminder of a new lease on life they’ve decided to start, or an end to a life of shame and self-consciousness about that one crook in the nose or that enlarged mole. Let’s face it: The standards of beauty out there, whether it’s a well-defined face, high cheekbones or coveted “double eyelids,” weigh on many as social pressure from all sides — the workplace, the classroom, at home and, most dangerously, from within. Is it wrong to conform to society’s standards of beauty when it’s practical and a large part of one’s livelihood? For better job prospects? For happiness?
Plastic surgery might be something we turn toward to satiate an unending yearning for more meaning and fulfillment, as a way to resolve deep-rooted insecurities. Or perhaps it’s to give that much-needed boost of self-esteem that a prettier face lends in society.
Many find the growth of plastic surgery for cosmetic purposes alarming, and would be quick to denounce such practices, pointing to the increasing superficiality of modern culture as something needing reform. But at the same time, it’s important to identify that the issue of cosmetic surgery lies in shades of gray.
Where does the line between emphasizing beauty with clothes and heavy makeup and cosmetic surgery exist? Who has the right to judge who is morally justified to go under the knife? To what degree does getting a double-eyelid surgery for self-esteem constitute a fair choice versus a dangerous, unnecessary obsession with body image?
No matter what, a human being’s worth cannot be reduced to appearances. And if that’s the case, it’s equally unfair to condemn plastic surgery as it is to encourage it. After all, even if it is the outside that changes, it is always the inside that counts most.

Generally I have interest in reading blog posts that covers plastic surgery topics. Here i came to find your blog when i was searching through Google. I really feel better while reading the post. Especially the last paragraph is superb to read.

As if the obvious tragedy of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut was not enough misery, a Kansas-based group called the Westboro Baptist Church used this nightmare as a platform to present even more pain. Margie Phelps, spokesperson of the group and daughter of its patriarchal leader, announced after the shooting that Westboro Baptist Church would conduct a protest at the funeral of a little girl who was gunned down in the school.
Led by 83-year-old pastor and disbarred lawyer Fred Phelps, Westboro Baptist Church is known for hate speech largely of an anti-homosexuality nature. Another daughter of Fred Phelps, Westboro member Shirley Phelps-Roper, says that the group’s reason for picketing tragedies, such as Hurricane Sandy and the Newtown, Conn. massacre, is “to sing praise to God for the glory of his work in executing his judgment.”
Fortunately for those disgusted with Westboro, the “hacktivist” group Anonymous, which engages in forms of online vigilantism, targeted the Phelps clan after Westboro announced that they intended to picket the funerals of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Beyond the mischievously humorous act of vandalizing a Westboro-run Twitter profile, Anonymous also hacked into the church’s offensively named website, godhatesfags.com, and released personal information about its members. Phone numbers and addresses were released online for anyone to see.
Potentially even more devastating to Westboro, however, was Anonymous’ drafting of two formal petitions on the White House’s official website. Both petitions have received enough signatures to qualify for review by President Barack Obama.
The first petition aims to strip Westboro Baptist of its tax-exempt status, thereby helping silence the group by draining its financial resources. Since its creation in December, this petition has reached the appropriate number of e-signatures to be officially reviewed by the government.
The second petition seeks to have Westboro’s official designation as a religious organization replaced with that of a hate group. As a legally defined hate group, Westboro’s rights would be severely cut and  it would also be stripped of its tax-exempt status. At over 310,000 signatures, this petition is the most-signed document on the White House website and can be found through the government’s official online petition portal.
Believing that any form of violent tragedy is the Lord’s divine punishment for America’s tolerance of homosexuality, Westboro Baptist Church has received widespread criticism from both secular as well as religious organizations. LGBT groups often organize counterprotests at many of Westboro’s anti-homosexuality pickets. But it is not only traditionally peaceful groups that find problems with the Phelps’ organization. The Klu Klux Klan even engaged in a counterprotest against a Westboro picket at the Arlington National Cemetery. Not many organizations bordering on being hate groups can say that even the KKK despises them.
Despite the virtually unanimous disapproval of Westboro Baptist Church, it is worth mentioning that the group only boasts about 40 members — most of whom belong to the extended Phelps family. In fact, many of Westboro’s pickets involve fewer than 10 members of the church. Put in this context, the group’s constant presence in the news can start to seem ridiculous to some; does this small handful of protesters really deserve the attention they get from the media? How is it even possible that such a small community has caused the stir it has?
Then again, the church only needs to respond to one event — such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy — to cause enough pain to warrant national attention.
Free speech is important — very important. In countries without it, people to this very day are being put to death for being vocal about certain beliefs. Moreover, Americans are extremely lucky to posses such freedoms. But with great freedom should come great responsibility.
Yes, Westboro Baptist Church, as declared by the Supreme Court of the United States in Snyder v. Phelps, has every right to picket the funerals of all the dead children they can possibly desire. But should they? Can’t Americans humbly accept this power with the gentle obligation to not abuse it?
In time, more tragedies will strike the nation and Westboro Baptist Church will undoubtedly blame them on the LGBT community. But hopefully more will be done to check abuses of the First Amendment before more families need to suffer unnecessary pain at the funerals of their loved ones.

Where does one persons rights begin and another persons end? Yes, they have the right to protest or say whatever they want to BUT that does not mean someone HAS to listen to it. A person has a right to be laid to rest in peace. The family members have the right to mourn their loss. Their lack of compassion is disturbing. Just because you CAN do something doesn’t mean you SHOULD. A true Christian should know this. Which makes you question their real motives.
Appraise the Lord! 
Tax the churches.
Haha! XD It’s pretty bad when the KKK despises a hate group such as the WBC & we all know what they stand for! The WBC are a bunch of low-life scumbag cowards who if they think they’re going anywhere near Heaven are in for a huge surprise. I highly doubt that their god would appreciate them praising him for dead soldiers & murdered children nor would he appreciate them protesting at their funerals & shouting obscenities at their grieving friends & families.
I don’t dispise this  group, I praise them.
The Bible book of Romans chapter 1 says God is on THEIR side:
18God’s anger is revealed from heaven against all the sin and evil of the people whose evil ways prevent the truth from being known. 19God punishes them, because what can be known about God is plain to them, for God himself made it plain. 20 Ever since God created the world, his invisible qualities, both his eternal power and his divine nature, have been clearly seen; they are perceived in the things that God has made. So those people have no excuse at all! 21 They know God, but they do not give him the honor that belongs to him, nor do they thank him. Instead, their thoughts have become complete nonsense, and their empty minds are filled with darkness. 22They say they are wise, but they are fools; 23 instead of worshiping the immortal God, they worship images made to look like mortals or birds or animals or reptiles.
24And so God has given those people over to do the filthy things their hearts desire, and they do shameful things with each other. 25They exchange the truth about God for a lie; they worship and serve what God has created instead of the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever! Amen.
26Because they do this, God has given them over to shameful passions. Even the women pervert the natural use of their sex by unnatural acts. 27In the same way the men give up natural sexual relations with women and burn with passion for each other. Men do shameful things with each other, and as a result they bring upon themselves the punishment they deserve for their wrongdoing.
28Because those people refuse to keep in mind the true knowledge about God, he has given them over to corrupted minds, so that they do the things that they should not do. 29They are filled with all kinds of wickedness, evil, greed, and vice; they are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, deceit, and malice. They gossip 30and speak evil of one another; they are hateful to God, insolent,[b] proud, and boastful; they think of more ways to do evil; they disobey their parents; 31they have no conscience; they do not keep their promises, and they show no kindness or pity for others. 32They know that God’s law says that people who live in this way deserve death. Yet, not only do they continue to do these very things, but they even approve of others who do them.
*despise, not dispise
Take your spam elsewhere, Holocaust-denying troll.
let him who is without sin cast the first stone. dare to claim you are one such person, go on, and break 1 of the 10 laws god saw fit to set in stone. not one of the parts interpreted by man but one of the bits god actually wrote personaly
When you can read this in the original language it was written in, come back and spout your opinion, but if you did read it in the original language you would see the meaning is a bit different.
Will, we all despise this group of people. But some of your points are a bit too idealistic. You have to understand how this group retains its autonomy.
Fred Phelps is a coward and a scumbag, but also a lawyer. Anonymous may be considered to be in a positive light here (let’s not act like they always are that way), but releasing the names, etc. only encourages people to do bad things. When these bad things happen, as they have (threatening calls, vandalism, etc.), it simply entitles Phelps & Co. to sue and obtain more money and notoriety (though not the good kind). Ultimately, this just leads to more publicity and more power for this group.
The e-petitions put into effect by whitehouse.gov don’t mean anything. When is the last time any action was taken to address these, status, completion, or otherwise? The one release so far has been the ridiculous Death Star recognition petition. Jokes like this, while humorous, only serve to distract from the point of these petitions and make them seem inconsequential as a whole (which they are anyway: see the recent increase in signatures required). We’re made to think we are activists by signing these, but they mean nothing. I am more than in favor of labeling these people a hate group, but this again just gives them more publicity. They want this. The reason that this small community doesn’t go away is because we keep bringing them back into the picture.

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, it seems like a good time to take a look at how school shootings are portrayed in the media. Michael Moore’s documentary, Bowling for Columbine provides a gritty look into the American world of easily obtainable guns and the horrifying symptoms that that world can face when these weapons fall into the wrong hands. Bang, Bang, You’re Dead, based on a play popular with high school drama departments in the early 2000s, tries to offer reasons as to why high school outsiders can resort to Columbine-esque violence. And with Zero Day inspired by the video journals made by the shooters at Columbine High School, indie director Ben Coccio uses the “found footage” style to create a film that feels very natural, adding to the disturbing realism that caused Columbine journalist Ben Cullen to call Zero Day, “the one great Columbine film.”
The debate about gun control is not one that will be settled anytime soon. It is important to note that these films, the most prominent that deal with school shootings, were all released several years ago. After a brief buffer period, the immediate post-9/11 era gave rise to an abundance of films that address gun violence. Since then, the trend has all but ceased. With the recent shootings in Portland, Aurora and Newtown, more filmmakers may be drawn to write about gun violence. This would certainly get the general public – and perhaps more importantly, the Internet-armed youth of America – to talk more openly about the debate surrounding gun control, which hopefully, will lead to a solution before another town becomes associated with gun-related death.

2012 was a year of abundances – iPhone 5 sales, “Call Me Maybe” downloads, and surprisingly, infidelity cases. From political figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Patraeus to our faves like Jude Law and K. Stew, it seems as if cheating has become the new trend, alongside Fifty Shades of Grey and Honey Boo Boo.
It’s become nothing out of the ordinary to hear of another one of our favorite couples going downhill because of some spicy polyamorous scandal (Heidi and Seal, my heart goes out to you). The act of cheating is so frequented among the famed that it begs the argument as to what really is causing the rise in divorce numbers. It could just be the regressive contemporary way of living, but the press showcasing famous figures committing a sin and not paying the moral price may be the culprit.
It’s as if the press is tolerating, almost condoning infidelity, much in the same way they dehumanize murder and shootings. Because infidelity seems so common, it no longer holds its piercing sting, or top spot as unspoken taboo.
Were the morals and principles of traditional marriage not commitment, loyalty, “‘til death do us part?”
Don’t try blaming the ruins of marriage on the same-sex couples either. Gay and lesbian couples are examples of the moral monogamous traditions that stronghold marriages together, yet they are still fighting a majority to be viewed as equal. The general public’s most idolized figures, accepted by the same majority, from all sub areas of fame are doing the dirty deed with the nanny, the assistant, and the hot cheerleader.
Same-sex marriage won’t be the thing to get the best of traditional marriage. In fact, we won’t have to worry about same-sex marriage ruining tradition since cuckolds and mistresses are ruining it before same-sex marriages will ever get the chance.

Petraeus, not Patraeus.
Look, I get the intent of this article (it is an entertainment blog after all), but this just is bizarre on multiple levels.
First, it claims without any sort of measure that cheating is widespread. The only “evidence” it provides is that certain high-profile people have been caught up in these scandals. Since when do these cases speak for everyone? Then, it mentions that “it begs the argument as to what really is causing the rise in divorce numbers.” What divorce numbers? For actors, actresses, and other famous people that don’t live in the “real world”? I could buy that – celebrities have enough self-inflicted problems as it is. Or are you extrapolating again to include the near 50% divorce rate in America? If so, this claim is ludicrous. Sure, in some cases, infidelity may be a driving factor, but what data do you have to back that up? There are many couples to which infidelity hasn’t broken their relationship. There are a myriad of other reasons why relationships fail, and many of them surround money and possessions. I could go on, but you get my point. Simply claiming that “cheating is a trend” is beyond ridiculous. In this article, you have only a few examples of people who have been caught up in this, and that’s it. Why don’t we address the bigger issues, like the all too simple invasion of privacy of Petraeus’s emails by the FBI? I don’t condone infidelity, but that story exposed far bigger concerns.
You could argue that by simply presenting these cases that the press condones them, but I think there are other motives. In this country, we simply love to tear people down from the top. Look at all the people who have adored Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong and then tore them down incessantly when their secrets came to light. It’s time for people to get off their high horse, in my opinion. An individual life is far more complex than what is reported in the media; there are multitude of things we will never understand about these individuals and why they do what they do. Anything popular in this country will always tend to come crashing down in public opinion one way or another, fueled first by the media and secondly by our rush to judgment with lack of information. I could digress and say that the media as a whole in this country is a waste that simply distracts us from more important things (since 99.99% of stories don’t directly influence us in any way), but I’ll leave it at that.
Finally, the author sets up a straw man argument, claiming that people blame the failure of marriages on same-sex couples. Who does that? “Gay and lesbian couples are examples of the moral monogamous traditions that stronghold marriages together” <- how do you know this? How can you possibly prove the integrity of every gay marriage and then dare to claim these are somehow holier than non-same-sex marriages?
Like I said, I understand the intent of this article, but could we at least have something more coherent, something that doesn't extrapolate on some gossip?
