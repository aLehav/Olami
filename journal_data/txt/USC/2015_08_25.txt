In addition to the loss of its entire M.F.A. class of 2016, the Roski School of Art and Design was dealt another blow earlier this month with the resignation of Professor Sharon Lockhart after a major dispute over changes to the school’s curriculum.
Lockhart, considered both one of the top professors within Roski and one of Los Angeles’ most influential artists, is known for her unique and cutting-edge photographs and films. The dispute reportedly led her to accept another job at Cal Arts.
Before Lockhart’s resignation, seven other Roski M.F.A. students dropped out of the school. As of the first week of August, only one person had enrolled in the M.F.A. class of 2016. Those who withdrew from the program, known as the “USC Seven,” said they do not plan on returning to the school and have been supported in their decision by past alumni of the M.F.A. program as well as other graduate peers.
Erica Muhl, the art school’s dean, has been the subject of much criticism following this month’s events. Earlier in August, the M.F.A. class of 2015 gathered over 800 signatures calling for Muhl’s resignation. The petition included signatures from the former Dean of the School of Fine Arts John S. Gordon, UCLA photography professor Catherine Opie and many other influential people.
Claire Dumelle, a current undergraduate student in the Roski School of Art and Design, said she was originally open to applying to the M.F.A. program.
“I was planning on applying, but I’m reconsidering because of the curriculum changes,” Dumelle said. “My first choice was obviously Roski, but I’m now looking at other programs.”
Dumelle said that other students in her school feel the same way.
Brigitte Crisp, another student in Roski with an emphasis in painting and design, expressed her disappointment in the changes within the program.
“I would not consider [the Roski] M.F.A. program anymore because I truly feel bad for the M.F.A. students and the disappointment that they went through with their education,” Crisp said. “I would never want to be in that position.”
Though the M.F.A. program is only for graduate students, the repercussions of its decline still stand to affect undergraduate Roski students as well. Some students said they were hoping to complete both their undergraduate and graduate studies at USC, and now many believe they won’t be able to.

Trojan legacy · Elaine Otter Leventhal and her husband Kenneth Leventhal donated $15 million in 1995 to become the namesake of the accounting school the following year. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
Philanthropist Elaine Otter Leventhal died of a stroke on Aug. 15 at the age of 97. She is remembered for her philanthropy and volunteerism.
“Elaine was a tremendous friend to the university,” President C. L. Max Nikias told USC News. “She and her late husband, Kenneth Leventhal, have a permanent place in the history of USC.”
In 1995, Leventhal and her husband gave $15 million to the School of Accounting, which was renamed in their honor. In addition to her other achievements,  Leventhal was presented by USC Libraries with the first-ever Ex Libris Award for her years of service as president of the Friends of the USC Libraries. She was involved in many philanthropic organizations up until her death, including the Museum of Natural History and the Institute of Human Origins, where she served as a board member.
Born in Chicago as Elaine Otter, Leventhal’s connection with USC began when her youngest son enrolled in the 1970s. In 1989, she enrolled in the USC Graduate School and earned her master’s degree in liberal arts. Leventhal was then awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree 11 years later from USC in recognition of her volunteer work.
“She was keenly interested in all aspects of our school … and was a beloved presence at virtually every event over the years,” William W. Holder, dean of the Leventhal School of Accounting, told USC News. “We will all miss her wise counsel and warm friendship.”
Leventhal is survived by her sons, Robert and Ross, daughter-in-law, Mary Jo, and granddaughter, Emma.

Three years after the release of their last studio album, Beach House is back with Depression Cherry, an album that marks a return to the basic patterns of dream pop from their earliest records.
The Baltimore-based duo’s fifth album heightens the feel of an electric guitar, live drums, vintage keyboards and the alluring voice of Victoria Legrand.
Alex Scally and Legrand have defined the dream pop genre. Their music is introspective and emotionally complex. It is part of a lucid daydream in which the air is thicker. Colors are more vivid. Emotions are stronger. Nothing about Beach House’s early albums or performances indicated their music would be of great appeal. From one album to the next, their transitions have been subtle.
Ultimately, the duo will continue to be one of those low-key bands that keeps releasing albums of good quality while a dedicated fanbase comes and goes.
Beach House, though a great band, is not trying to be the biggest band in the world.
“We continue to let ourselves evolve while fully ignoring the commercial context while we exist,” the band said in a statement under the album’s page on the Sub Pop website.
In this context, Depression Cherry is the duo’s most abstract work. It is an ideal soundtrack for daydreaming. Their sound, though distinctive, is structured around a simple melody and a few instruments.
The tracks are less upbeat. Pre-choruses transform into choruses, which transform into bridges. They have stripped down the booming drums from their previous album, Bloom, and boosted the synth and gauzy keyboards. Scally’s guitar serves as a foil to Legrand’s voice that is as beautiful and warm as ever.
The first track, “Levitation,” opens with Legrand’s peaceful voice delivering nothing but tenderness and delicacy. “I go anywhere you want to / You should see there’s a place I want to take you,” she sings, with a promise of travel to an unknown destination.
There is, however, no promise of arrival – Legrand just wants to take her audience along for the ride. It is this effect of melancholia and comfort that Beach House has perfected.
“Levitation” is followed by the album’s lead single, “Sparks,” the biggest departure from the album. Scally’s vintage organ fills up the uncomfortable ambient noise and harsher guitar tones make this track almost an unrecognizable Beach House song.
Scally employs the same guitar fills on “Beyond Love,” which delivers some of his best lyrical work: “The first that I do before I get into your house / I’m gonna tear off all the petals from the rose that’s in your mouth.”
The strength of “Levitation” and “Sparks” makes the rest of the album upsetting. The remaining seven songs are intriguing at times, but an entire track does not stand out from the pack. The band, however, admits that with this album they did not intend to push their limits.
In fact, they are getting back to their comfort zone. The problem is that getting out of its comfort zone is exactly what has allowed Beach House to be an unlikely success story.
In the press release for Depression Cherry, the duo included a quote from philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer: “Mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things.”
In the context of the album, this quote can speak about the duo’s want to grow in a direction far from their natural tendencies, away from the spotlight. It emphasizes not only how different Depression Cherry is, but how noteworthy their previous albums are.
Depression Cherry is out Friday.

Not a rom-com · Trainwreck, starring Amy Schumer, rejects the typical boy-meets-girl romantic comedy storyline. Schumer’s character is against monogamy until she meet’s Bill Hader’s character Adam. – Photo courtesy of Universal Studios
Going back to school means looking forward to the fall, but sometimes we can’t — or more appropriately, shouldn’t — look toward the future until we take a moment to reflect on what has happened in the past. This summer has been filled with plenty of hits and misses in the cinematic landscape, but the issue of progress in film for women is still left unanswered.
Comedian Amy Schumer’s Trainwreck was a definite summer hit to take into consideration; Schumer’s spin on the romantic comedy is a noteworthy example of a modern application of the genre. It’s no secret that the classic rom-com has long since come and gone — what little attempt studios make in following the boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-backundoubtedly ends in disaster (case in point: 2015’s The Rewrite starring Hugh Grant or 2014’s That Awkward Moment with Zac Efron). Trainwreck, written by Schumer and directed by Hollywood funnyman and USC alumnist Judd Apatow, however, has paved a new way in the genre by using an extremely radicalized and liberated female lead. Schumer’s character not only rejects “classic love” (her father teaches her “monogamy isn’t realistic” from a very young age ) but also continually subverts it. Though she is dating a strong, meaty guy — the type who’d seemingly have a dozen other girls in his proverbial little black book — Amy is the one who ends up breaking up the relationship by way of infidelity. Furthermore, Amy is confused when the guy states he’s upset that she’s seeing other people but feels little remorse when the relationship is over.
The ease with which her character moves on from her breakup illustrates a female lead who is not obsessive post-breakup — as so many women are often depicted on-screen — but rather, ok with independence. Later, when Amy begins to date Bill Hader’s sports doctor character Aaron, she finds herself increasingly paranoid that the women Aaron treats — beautiful, athletic and short-skirted Knicks City Dancers — are a threat to their relationship. But in a final Thelma and Louise-esque “we’re all in this together” progressive feminist twist, Amy asks for help from the dancers to choreograph a number that will hopefully reunite her and Aaron at the end of the film. Therefore, not only does the fact that Schumer stars in a film that she herself has written — female leads and female screenwriters in big-budget studio films are not only rare individually, but almost unheard of paired together — but she’s also created a plot that revolutionizes what can be expected from romantic comedies and women alike.
Mad Max: Fury Road — an earlier summer blockbuster — was a similarly feminist beacon of light this year. What appeared to be a male-oriented, high-octane, turbo-driven, Tom Hardy-led action blockbuster actually turned out to be a wildly surprising and progressive action flick headed by a startlingly strong and fierce Charlize Theron. Upon the first few minutes, the movie seems to be about Tom Hardy’s masked, shackled and illiterate Mad Max character, but as soon as Charlize’s Furiosa enters the frame, it’s clear that she is the main event. Not only does she save Max from being captured by the brutal Warlord and his henchmen several times throughout the film, but she also saves the Warlord’s enslaved five wives and declares the only way to freedom is to find and seek refuge in the “Green Place” — a land occupied entirely by women.
On top of all that, she does all this with only one arm.
Fury Road was a shining example of a big budget studio film with all the makings of being a testosterone filled slammer that actually turned into a beautiful and jarring tour de force of female action and definite assertion of power. Though director George Miller, who is now 70 years old and four films into the franchise, may seem too old-school, he’s proven with the latest Mad Max that he is anything but that.
These two films were examples of strikingly progressive cinema releases that startled audiences and delighted critics alike. They should be regarded as positive influences within the film industry for female empowerment and general equality.
Of course, no summer is without its low moments of marginalization (think Pitch Perfect 2 and Aloha), so it doesn’t mean we are in the clear yet. With time, however, comes even more progress, and now that we’ve done a cursory look behind us, it’s time to prepare for an exciting fall lineup of films. Brit Marling in The Keeping Room is a notable film to watch, as is Sundance Film Festival hit The Bronze — an apparently raunchy female comedy, like Schumer’s Trainwreck, written by and starring a woman. There’s potential for some great material, and we have Trainwreck and Mad Max to thank.

As the new semester begins, Wednesday’s Involvement Fair, taking place on Trousdale Parkway from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. looks to help freshmen and returning students alike discover the exciting opportunities USC has to offer.
No matter where students are in their academic journey, USC offers over 850 clubs and organizations to fit all ranges of interests.
Rising musicians and singers have an array of options for their artistic skills. USC offers  nine different A capella groups for vocally talented students looking for a performance outlet. There are several coed groups including the SoCal Vocals, Troy Tones, UnderScore and Reverse Osmosis. Gender-based groups such as the Sirens and Trojan Men offer a different experience as well as the culturally based South Asian fusion Asli Baat, and the East Asian Trogons. USC even offers a Christian A capella group called Overflow, which focuses on developing spirituality through music. A capella enthusiasts have the opportunity to travel the country, perform with famous artists and even compete in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (think Pitch Perfect).
For students interested in other artistic avenues such as acting, dance and comedy, USC offers a plethora of different clubs for the humorous and dramatic. Clubs such as Commedus Interruptus, Second Nature and Spoiler Alert practice improvisational comedy, often performing right on campus.
For the thespians of USC, Brand New Theater and Cardinal Theater Production are just two options for an experience with student-run productions, showing the campus the beauty of the spoken and acted arts.
Dance organizations run rampant amid the campus, developing and honing the skills of both beginners and experienced dancers. Mainstream genres, such as hip-hop welcome students to practice and perform with groups such as Break Through Hip Hop and Off the Grid dance team.
USC also offers an array of international dance genres such as the Latin and ballroom dance team USC Zeher, Bollywood dance, and even a Capoiera Club, which introduces a beautiful and powerful form of Brazilian dance infused with martial arts.
Political and social service is also a common interest of students at USC. With an exceptional focus on social and civic improvement, USC offers many organizations that can help students make a difference, not only in Los Angeles, but all across the world.
USC PAWS is an organization perfect for animal lovers. Members volunteer with various shelters and groups who foster care and passion for all living things.
Other service organizations focus on the community surrounding USC such as Food Recovery Network that collects surplus food from restaurants in order to feed the homeless at the nearby shelters and help fight poverty and food waste.
Globally, students can impact others through USC’s far-reaching social service clubs. GlobeMed works by empowering students to change the state of global health equity and world poverty. I AM THAT GIRL is another organization that hopes to create a global output of positive self-image dialogue for young girls.
For students who desire a faith-oriented experience, USC offers organizations for every religion (or non-religion). The InterFaith Council fosters an open dialogue for members to share their experience with their own spirituality, or lack thereof.
Some students desire to be more directly involved with their own faith community. The Caruso Catholic Center offers a church where Catholic students can participate in mass, service and discussion that builds their community. Down the block from the Catholic Center is USC Hillel, a place for students of the Jewish faith to worship and gather. USC also offers organizations and place of worship for many other faiths including Islam, Wicca, Hindu and the non-religious.
Though USC is known for its outstanding athletic excellence with its high division teams, there is no need to be a full-time college athlete in order to participate in sports on campus. USC offers beginner and intramural sports for all athletic interests. Traditional sports such as volleyball, softball and soccer are always popular club options, but there are far more recreational clubs to explore. USC offers climbing club, cricket, martial arts and even a Quidditch organization that involves full contact and full fun.
No matter what the interest or level of experience, USC is full of diverse, dynamic and life-changing organizations that help support its vibrant student life. Students can learn more about these organizations — and many others — throughout Welcome Week from the representatives and booths that will be present on campus.

As the latest phase of the historic California drought rears its ugly head, regulators have desperately scrambled to engage the millennial water waster in any way possible, most recently via the music station Pandora. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California’s “Water Lover’s Station” features songs about water and rain, and campaigners hope that citizens will time showers to the playlist to keep water conservation in mind. In the newest attempt to attract more people to the water conservation movement, MWD’s move parallels other approaches to water conservation that use social media and billboards as part of a multi-pronged effort to successfully appeal to millennials.
MWD’s promotion of the Pandora playlist comes at the heels of highly funded social media campaigns such as Lawn Dude and Save the Drop LA. Laced with catchy phrases like “Don’t do the sidewalk of shame” and “Recovering wateraholic,” these privately and publicly funded campaigns provide the friendly face that veils the not-so-friendly water restrictions mandated by the state. It’s a way for millennials to remember that water conservation is an essential part of collective action that they are obligated to participate in. It also targets demographics that may not respond to economic incentives — the upper class,
Perhaps the importance of the work of MWD and other campaigns remains understated. The unprecedented shortage of water in the state elicited             Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a state of emergency and mandate a 25 percent cut in statewide water usage. And at an estimated $2.7 billion, according to a University of California, Davis study, the drought’s economic impact has been severe. If citizens do not act collectively to make significant changes to water use, it could spell out even more trouble for California’s access to its most precious resource.
Considering that millennials are the least water-cautious — individuals between the age of 17 to 24 consume more water per capita than any other age group — they remain a tricky demographic to effectively influence. And since many of them do not yet live in their own homes, they do not face the cost crunches that force other demographics to conserve. But a message that hooks readers with humor but bears the heart of responsible citizenship might provoke a concrete response from young adults.
The ability of social media campaigns to lead to concrete solutions remains debatable. The approach, however — using humor as a hook to deliver a pointed message — has for years spelled success for advertisers, so outcomes for public message campaigns are optimistic. And when utilized as part of a multi-pronged approach — combined with turf rebate buyback programs, mandated water restrictions and revised rate-setting structures — a full-scale effort to keep Californians responsible incorporates both economic incentives to conserve and a sense of social responsibility.
When using tactile methods to save water, such as the newest conservation movement featuring Pandora, media campaigns could encourage people to improve personal water footprints. For example, though donations to the Pacific Institute steer researchers toward finding effective solutions, the lack of transparency behind the research creates a disconnect between those affected by the drought and the productive change created in the environment. Instead, by reminding listeners of the “Water Lover’s” station of an adequate shower time, people are further educated about actual methods to combat the drought, rather than helping the cause through blind and passive means. Moreover, the MWD campaign resonates more with debt-burdened college students since shorter showers and drought-friendly landscaping require less fiscal resources than donations to research institutes.
With an unprecedented emphasis on new forms of media, these drought campaigns tell us something else: the way conservation activists engage with the public has fundamentally changed. Calling for action no longer takes the form of sad PETA commercials and frightening PSAs. Humor seems to be the new key to meaningful engagement.
To effectively obliterate the California drought dilemma, tactics have to appeal to a wider audience, especially the millennial generation. To do this, Pandora’s “Water Lover’s” campaign, along with other social media campaigns, have the potential to deliver concrete solutions. After all, this is, as Lawn Dude eloquently put it, #NotYoMommasDrought.

Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
On the first day of August, rather than dwell on the sad fact that summer is coming to an end, thousands of people rushed to the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds for the Hard Summer music festival. They flooded in, wearing tight spandex and bright makeup, ready to listen to the sounds of The Weeknd and Odesza.
Two girls, however, didn’t get the chance to spend the weekend with their friends or scream when their favorite acts came on stage. Instead, they were rushed to the hospital before the end of the first night. Eighteen-year-old Tracy Nguyen and 19-year-old Katie Dix were tragically both pronounced dead early Sunday morning due to suspected overdoses of illegal drugs. Once word got out, L.A. County officials made a hasty and ineffective decision to ban raves, incorrectly deeming it the only solution to the prevalent drug abuse.
The deaths at the Hard Summer music festival have revived a greater conversation about illegal drug use at raves. Such a debate is not new by any means; in 2010, USC’s very own Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum witnessed the death of a 15-year-old during the Electric Daisy Carnival, which called for the Coliseum’s temporary ban on raves. As history repeats itself, officials have unanimously voted to ban these types of events on the county’s soil — yet again.
The idea of banning raves altogether to reduce drug use is synonymous with preaching abstinence rather than educating young people on safe sex measures. In an ideal world, prevention would be the best solution, but realistically, officials and leaders need to understand that drugs will always be around and available. Whether dancing at a fairground or going to a party at a friend’s house, anyone can choose to take drugs. `
A much better answer is drug education. If these two girls knew the various effects of different drugs or warning signs when under the influence, perhaps they could have gotten the necessary medical treatment before it was too late. If their friends were also educated, they could have rushed to get help at the first sign of trouble.
The education process could manifest itself in a few different ways. A mandatory online               drug-education course could be put into place when a ticket to a rave is purchased, similar to the courses universities make all of their new students take. Even if a few people in the large crowd knew when medical attention was necessary, a life could be saved.
Unfortunately, accidental overdoses may still occur, so the education process needs to go one step further. People need to know their rights. They need to know that they can and should call for help in the event of a medical emergency, even if illegal drugs are involved.
California’s “Good Samaritan” law protects both the caller and victim from any legal repercussions in a situation where medical treatment is necessary. For example, if someone was at a rave and knew the person next to him or her desperately needed medical attention, he or she could call 911 to get help without having to worry about being arrested or prosecuted for drug use. Though the law is not advertised so as not to encourage illegal drug use, maybe it is time for it to stop being swept under the rug. If more people knew about it, they would bring friends or even strangers to the nearest medical tent or medical professional when necessary. When people wait to seek help and fear getting in trouble, lives can be lost.
Millions of people attend raves each year, spending weekends surrounded by music and people who want to have a great time. Known for promoting love and unity, the rave community is an important part of people’s lives around the world. While these overdoses should absolutely not have happened at the Hard Summer music festival, they were not an immediate result of the event, the venue or the security. Their deaths are not a reflection of the rave culture, but of the lack of drug education in general.
Overdoses are one of the leading causes of death each year in the United States, but most of those don’t happen at dance festivals. According to the New York Times, about 19 people have died due to overdoses or drugs at a music festival in California and Las Vegas — where most of the major festivals take place — since 2006. Compared to the 38,329 fatal overdoses that occurred in the U.S. in 2010, deaths at music festivals pale in comparison to drug overdoses in other settings.         Drug-related incidents can happen in a home, at a park or after a party, and until we stop relying on prevention and start relying on education, they won’t stop any time soon.

Senior Associate Director of Athletics and Chief Innovation Officer Mark Jackson was named the athletic director at Villanova University on Tuesday.
Athletic Director Pat Haden, who’s worked alongside Jackson for about a half decade now, showed his support for Jackson.
“Mark Jackson was an incredible asset to the Trojan family and, while we are sad to see him leave Los Angeles, Villanova University has hired one of the best young minds in collegiate athletics today,” Haden said. “Mark has been an integral member in continuing our winning traditions in the classroom and on the field. His enormous impact on developing and implementing strategic plans, fundraising and managing our staff cannot be overstated.”
Jackson started out as the director of football administration from 2001 to 2004 alongside former head coach Pete Carroll. In 2003 he was also named the assistant athletic director in addition to his other responsibilities. 
Jackson left USC in 2005 to become the executive senior associate athletic director at Syracuse University. He also served as the director of football development with the Oakland Raiders from 2007 to 2008 before returning to USC in 2009 as the senior associate athletic director.
After returning to USC, Jackson oversaw the construction of the McKay Center, Uytengsu Aquatics Center and Heritage Hall, as well as the athletic department’s relations with the Coliseum. 
Jackson was also responsible for overseeing several teams at USC including football, baseball and women’s lacrosse and was in charge of the athletic support services, including sports medicine, strength and conditioning, nutrition, security and equipment and apparel operations. 
Before his time at USC, Jackson worked as a coaching assistant with the New England Patriots for three seasons from 1998 to 2000, assisting with special teams and running backs. 
Jackson will bring his nearly 20 years of experience to Villanova when he officially begins on Sept. 21. 
“Villanova is an elite academic institution with a prestigious athletic brand, and I understand the responsibility I now have to uphold Villanova’s high standards for excellence,” Jackson said.  “I can’t wait to get started.”

Comedian Pete Holmes has been pushing boundaries with his work ever since the start of his career in 2001. Through his highly-acclaimed 2011 comedy album, Impregnated with Wonder, his Youtube parodies and his conversations with other comedic giants on his podcasts, Holmes has delighted his audiences with his sharp humor. On Aug. 23, Holmes performed at the Welcome Back Comedy Show. In an email to the Daily Trojan, he offered some introspection on comedy and on how college students can make it in the business. The interview has been lightly edited for style and clarity.
Daily Trojan: You’ve found many outlets for your comedy with your podcasts, television shows and collaborations with other comedians. In this day and age where there are constantly new ways, including social media and internet specials, for comedians to reach audiences, what platform do you think is most important for a comedian and why?
Pete Holmes: I really think it’s all comedy, and a joke will tell you where it belongs. Some ideas are perfect to do as stand-up, others may be short sketches you do for YouTube and others may be short films or books or a cartoon. You just have to ask yourself where it feels right. Because the thing that’s going to get the most attention is good work, and good work starts with honoring where an idea wants to grow best.
DT: Speaking of collaborations with other comedians, you have worked closely with Conan O’Brien in the past. In your podcasts, you’ve had the opportunity to interview other greats in comedy. What does it feel like to work with other comedians, and how does that affect your material?
PH: It’s great to collaborate with other comedians, especially like-minded ones. Conan was a dream come true, obviously, and we shared a lot of the same sensibility, so that was a nice fit. A lot of the time, however, if I can, I like to do things like starting a podcast or writing a script on my own. I’m only saying this because college students looking to get into comedy may be quick to pair off with someone they “kinda” like. Too often another person in your project can become an excuse to never get it done; for example, “They were never available when I was” or “They didn’t take it as seriously as I did.” So, when the time comes to collaborate, make sure you find the right partner. I’m glad, for instance, that I host my podcast alone. It’s hard enough finding a time for two people sit down, let alone three or four. That being said, I come from an improv background and love collaborating with other funny people on stage or acting in a scene together. The Ex-Men sketches, for example, were so much fun trying to improvise and make the other person laugh. That gives a pulse and an energy to the project that’s hard to write on the page. The scenes I’ve done with Thomas Middleditch stand out as favorites and, of course, Matt McCarthy.
DT: Though humorous parodies, YouTube videos “Badman,” “Sherlock Holmes Sucks at Deduction” and Ex-Men: Jean Grey” are rooted in very acute observation. How do you extract the truth in what everyone is thinking and infuse that with comedy? What would you like your audience to get out of your routine?
PH: For those sketches, they were just the elaboration on a basic observation. Like, “It would be funny if Batman were the only stupid thing in Chris Nolan’s dark, serious world.” Or watching Sherlock and noticing that there’s no way he could be right all the time. So you take a small observation like that and you expand on it and work with incredible directors that can make the feel of the sketch match the T.V. show or movie, and then you put it out there in hopes that maybe people will relate. But I don’t try to think of things that people will relate to or something that everyone was thinking, I just try to do what I think is funny and has a shot at other people thinking is funny.
As far as what I want people to get out of my routine is obviously some silly fun, some relief through laughing, some solidarity to see people laughing at the same things as you are and an overall feeling of being less alone in this weird, weird world.
DT: At USC, there are many improv groups with aspiring comedians who look up to you and your work. When you were in college, which comedians did you look up to, and how did they affect your decision to go into comedy?
PH: I was big into Steve Martin (his standup), Brian Regan and Jerry Seinfeld. Those guys were doing it in a way I wanted to do it: Silly, hilarious and smart.
The big advice I would give any of those improv teams is to do as many shows as you can, or at least have open rehearsals. I look back at my own college improv team and wonder, “Why didn’t we just do a show once a month or once a week?” Nothing teaches you like doing it on stage. Everything else is just theory.
DT: Los Angeles is definitely a different environment than most college towns. How should college students take advantage of this city to study comedy?
PH: I studied at [Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre] and highly recommend it — the improv program. I have friends who did classes at iO as well and liked them. The main thing would be see as many shows as you can and lay low, meaning don’t get a reputation as a weird college kid who’s always cornering people for advice. Just play it cool, observe and when you start to write stand-up or sketch ask yourself, “When would I laugh if I saw this?” If you’re not sure, chances are neither will the audience be. The Meltdown on Wednesdays is the best stand-up in town, and Largo is amazing for comedy. I also like the Improv, but a club is different from night to night, so make sure you like the line-up.
DT: Lastly, do you have any advice for USC students who want to go into comedy? How should they face rejection and adversity?
PH: I would say if you want to do comedy, do comedy. There’s nothing stopping you from doing an open mic or joining an improv team or writing funny essays or drawing cartoons or, if none of that seems doable, studying great comedy from afar until you build up the nerve. Surround yourself with people who have good attitudes, are better than you and aren’t just going to drag you down with how hard everything is or how unfair everything is. Keep creating. Don’t be afraid to fail. Good jokes lie at the end of a road paved with bad jokes. Have confidence, but don’t forget to balance it out with some uncertainty and humanity. No one likes a cocky turd. Be honest, and try and find the comedy that you do best. In other words, find your voice. If you’re being authentic to you, your background, your wants and your fears, no one will be doing exactly what you are doing how you are doing it. Try out your influences, but shed them before anyone notices (their styles, not their material). And if you face hardship or adversity, it’s a good sign you’re doing the work. Take it with pride, and try not to take it personally. We all suck for about five years, it’s what paying your dues means. Keep your eyes on your own paper, keep your head down, don’t expect a “manager” or a “deal” or talk about how much money you want to make, do the work for the work, make the art you want to see in the world, get on stage, write and, as with all things, don’t be a d*ck.

Sorry Sark · Head coach Steve Sarkisian issued an apology after using inappropriate langauge and exhibiting unsuitable behavior at an event on campus for alumni and donors over the weekend. Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Three days after reportedly speaking while intoxicated at USC’s annual Salute to Troy event, head football coach Steve Sarkisian publicly apologized to the media on Tuesday morning before practice in a press conference at Howard Jones Field.
“I’d like to apologize for my behavior Saturday night,” Sarkisian said. “It was inappropriate. I feel bad for the University of Southern California, [President] Max Nikias, [Athletic Director] Pat Haden, our players and my own kids. The way I acted was irresponsible. It is something I obviously don’t condone.”
Sarkisian reportedly used foul language and called out other programs at the on-campus event Saturday night in front of donors and alumni before being taken off stage by Haden and Associate Athletic Director J.K. McKay.
The 41-year-old head coach admitted he mixed unspecified medication with alcohol and indicated that he will seek treatment, although he does not believe he needs to attend rehab.
“I truly believe in myself as a coach to lead this team and to be the best coach for this team to win a championship,” Sarkisian said. “I’m thankful that I’m surrounded by wonderful people, and that this university can offer no better support than any other university in the country, but I was not right.”
Sarkisian admitted that there was alcohol in the coaches’ locker room “after great wins,” but maintained that there has never been alcohol in the team’s players’ locker room. Alcohol has been banned from the facility entirely, according to Sarkisian.
 “I don’t believe so,” Sarkisian said when asked if he had a drinking problem. “Through Pat and the University, I’m going to find that out. I’m going to go to treatment and deal with it.”
The second-year head coach said he met with the team and disclosed everything. He also said reached out to Nikias and talked at great length with Haden. 
“At the end of the day, you play the hand you’re dealt,” Sarkisian said. “I’m going to play my hand. I’m not proud of the things that have occurred for me, but I know I’m a good football coach, and I know we’re a good football team.” 
Two of the team’s leaders, quarterback Cody Kessler and linebacker Su’a Cravens, also showed support for their coach following his press conference. 
“He came to us as a man and looked us in the face and apologized, and I think this brought us closer together,” Kessler said. 
Sarkisian’s acts didn’t go unpunished, though, as Kessler said the team made him do up-downs on Monday.
“He came back drenched in sweat,” Kessler said.
Following the press conference, the team got back on the field for its first practice of the week as it now tries to shift the attention back to football on the field.

There’s a lot to look forward to at the beginning of the semester – new friends, new classes, new activities, and new environments. Just as important, however, is figuring out how to carry on with old, basic habits. Like eating.
The USC dining halls can be a scary place for both new and returning students, but traversing the buffet lines at EVK, Parkside and Café 84 can be easier than you think.
1. Embrace the idea of eating alone.
While it’s always great to sit down and enjoy a meal with your classmates or roommates, or even try to make new friends by sharing a meal, it’s also not always possible. Different class and activity schedules mean you might end up squeezing in meals at weird hours of the day. Breakfast might be at 11 a.m., and lunch might be at 3 p.m. Eating alone may seem awkward, but it can actually be one of the most relaxing parts of your day. For 20 minutes, all you have to worry about is the food on your plate, and whether you want to get seconds.
2. Get creative with your meals.
Pizza and pasta everyday can sound like a great idea until you actually have to eat pizza and pasta everyday. The dining halls may not always have options that suit your tastes, but there are so many ways to personalize meals in the dining halls. Here are some of my favorite suggestions:
You can ask the cooks to grill chicken or turkey burgers when they aren’t serving them that day. Get some grilled chicken, season with salt and pepper, place on a bed of leafy greens, and dress to your heart’s content with one of the many dressing options. For another healthy addition, pile some fruits and veggies on your plate.
Soft serve + Root beer or soda of choice. So simple, but so yummy.
This combination goes well with toast, bagels, ice cream, or even just as a snack on its own.
Get bacon. Put in waffle mix. Make waffle. Be super happy!
Choose your ingredients, and decide if you want a sweet or savory crepe. My favorite combination for a savory crepe is tomatoes, chicken and pesto, and for a sweet crepe I usually go for the classic chocolate, banana and strawberry combination. They even have Nutella!
3. Time your meals accordingly
There are going to be times when the line into the dining hall is going to be out the door. If you’re eating on a tight schedule, make sure you steer clear of the dining halls’ busiest times:

You can also look up the dining hall hours here to make sure you don’t make the trek if the dining hall is closed. (Also some dining halls, like EVK, will take a 30-minute break between breakfast and lunch, which is 10-10:30 a.m. on weekdays. While you can finish you meal if you’re already in the dining hall, you won’t be able to enter until it opens up again.
Also be sure to thank the hospitality workers in the dining halls and keep your eye out for EVKitty. Happy dining!

I spent months anticipating my semester abroad. I read countless travel blogs, and spoke to friends and family who have traveled abroad all in preparation for this trip. I packed and prepared as best as I could and I really thought that I had done my best. I thought I had it all under control, but I came to learn that there are just some things that you can never fully prepare for. You can try your best, but sometimes your best isn’t enough, and that’s honestly okay.
Following that, I’d like to share tips from all the unexpected things I’ve learned thus far, so that future London-bound travelers can be a little more at ease.
There’s not much you can do to combat it, but the humidity is definitely one of the things that no one told me about — and it caught me completely off guard.
Walking shoes are essential. I heard it plenty of times before I arrived in London, but it’s really hard to fully grasp the concept until you get here. I brought my tennis shoes, but they aren’t true “walking shoes.” Walking shoes are a whole different category that isn’t very common in Los Angeles. Buy a pair of comfortable, supportive, waterproof shoes, and be prepared to walk 5-10 miles a day.
Everyone says it, but you won’t understand until you’re here. Don’t splurge on things you don’t need because it can, and will, get out of hand. One pound is equivalent to $1.63 back in the U.S., and it’s often hard to keep the exchange rate in mind. However, it’s important to limit your spending budget, because you’ll automatically spend more than in the U.S.
It’s a lot more crowded here than I ever thought it would be. It’s even worse than the first week of the semester at USC when everyone actually goes to class. There are Disneyland-size crowds everywhere you go.
It has taken longer than I anticipated for it to sink in that I’m finally here, living in London. I looked forward to going to London for so long, and built up all these hopes and dreams for the program, but it was very disorienting when I landed and didn’t get a sense of fulfillment right away. That’s not at all to say that it isn’t a good experience. Rather, it will just take time for the realization to sink in. It may not be rainbows and unicorns from the second you land in London, especially taking culture shock and jet lag into consideration. There will be obstacles along with the good times, and that can be hard to realize in the months leading up to this trip of a lifetime.
In the end, you can prepare all you want, but you must also be prepared for the unknown. There are certain things that you simply will not be able to grasp until you get here. Learn to embrace the new and unfamiliar. On top of this all, make sure to keep an open mind and have fun! Don’t let the unexpected situations get you down.

The Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism and Internet Media held a panel Friday entitled “California’s Video Game Industry: Staying on Top of a Changing Game” in the School of Cinematic Arts.
The aim of the event was to examine what the video game industry looks like and how important California is to the industry’s present and future, as well as the role universities will play in training the next generation of workers.
The panel, which included committee members Adrin Nazarian, Dana Mitchell, California State Assembly members Ling Ling Chang, Matthew Dababneh and Reginald Jones Sawyer, was led by Committee Chair Ian C. Calderon led the panel.
The event began with an overview of the video game industry led by Erik Huey, senior vice president of Government Affairs for the Entertainment Software Association, Tracy Fullerton, director of USC Games and Kevin Klowden, managing director of the Milken Institute’s California Center and managing economist of the Milken Institute.
Huey spoke about California’s history as a pioneer in the video game industry, as well as how the industries already located in California make the area a hub for innovation in video games.
“California is the spiritual home of our industry,” Huey said. “This industry really started here with Pong. We really are the bridge between the tech community in Northern California and the entertainment community in Hollywood.”
Fullerton went into further detail about how the schools within USC work together to make USC a leader in interactive media.
“As we all know, games are a vastly multidisciplinary endeavor,” Fullerton said. “So while we have our degrees in the Cinematic Arts — our M.F.A.s, our B.A.s, our minors, our Ph.Ds — we consider ourselves part of a family of USC games with Viterbi School of Engineering and their graduate programs and bachelor’s programs. All of these students work together across their disciplines on the same projects. We also work with the art school at USC Roski. Just recently, we’ve brought on a new cross-disciplinary degree with the Keck School of Medicine for games and health.”
Fullerton also discussed the future for games at USC.
“In the future we’re planning on degrees in games and learning,” Fullerton said. “These are all fields that are beyond just entertainment in games, and we need to be prepared to educate the next generation of designers into interventions in health and wellness and education that use all of the fantastic abilities of games to engage us to make our lives better.”
The event continued with a discussion on how California can strengthen its position in the video game industry led by Peter Marx, chief technology officer for the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office of Innovation, and Will Koch, deputy director of California Competes Tax Credit Program.
Marx explained how L.A. has evolved from being a place that was originally considered unfriendly to buisnesses becoming a hub for startups.
“Here in L.A., we’re quite lucky,” Marx said. “We love to be number one in everything. As it turns out right now we’re actually the third largest startup ecosystem in the United States, according to a report that came out a couple of days ago. We have more startups than any other metro. Quite frankly, we also have the largest level of employment of any city. And I don’t want to compare us to the Silicon Valley, but in the city area, L.A. is doing pretty well.”
Dababneh concluded the event by highlighting the importance of incentivizing developers to stay in California.
“This isn’t about one movie or one TV series that we’re trying to lure back,” Dababneh said. “It’s about brick and mortar jobs. It’s about the students here at USC deciding they’re not going to Austin or Salt Lake City or another state to start their business.”
Clarification: This article previously stated Tracy Fullerton was the director of the USC Game Innovation Lab. Fullerton was serving on the panel in her role as the director of USC Games.
What, no mention of gamers being serial rapists?  What has the world come to when that’s not included in an article on gaming. 
I too, came to this article expecting the worst. Clealy this article was not written by a social justice warrrior.

USC will be one of the first locations for the Metro Transit Association’s $11 million bike sharing program with Bicycle Transit Systems for Los Angeles.
The program will begin in Spring 2016 with 65 bike sharing stations. In downtown Los Angeles alone, there will be more than 1,000 bicycles, and Metro plans to expand the program to Pasadena and other surrounding L.A. communities. In total, there are to be 4,000 bicycles throughout the Greater Los Angeles area.
The program will start with several stations at Downtown landmarks, including Pershing Square, Grand Park, the Staples Center and USC.
David Donovan, associate director of USC Transportation at the Health Sciences Campus, said the exact locations around USC have yet to be determined, but they will most likely be near the Figueroa Corridor.
According to Donovan, the Figueroa corridor will be experiencing changes to accommodate more bicycles due to a program called MyFigueroa.
“The Corridor will be undergoing renovation to add a dedicated bike lane in both directions in the next 18 months as part of the same project,” Donovan said.
Donovan notes that while this program is for the whole Los Angeles community, it specifically is beneficial to USC students.
“It will connect USC students to areas in downtown Los Angeles, including the Convention Center, Staples Center and L.A. Live by means of a separate and dedicated bike lane away from vehicle traffic.” Donovan said.
USC Transportation looks forward to the program in Los Angeles.
“We agree with Metro that the time is right for Los Angeles residents to continue to pursue alternate, green forms of transportation and can’t wait to see the bicycle program implemented,” Donovan wrote in an email.
Some students at USC are excited for the new and convenient initiative. Annisah Garrett-Gianardi, a senior majoring in psychology, said the bike program will make getting around town easier.
“It will make getting to and from classes, as well as going downtown a lot easier to do,” Gianardi said. “I am looking forward to riding with friends that do not have bikes around L.A. now too.”
Sarah Greene, a junior majoring in economics, said she thinks the program will allow students to experience downtown Los Angeles in a new way.
“I am the type of person who religiously takes the Metro to Downtown, but I miss riding my bike like I do at home all the time,” Greene said. “I can’t wait to experience going downtown to new places with a bicycle. I think it will make Downtown a lot more fun.”
Sorry to disappoint you Trojans, but you’re not getting bike share next year.  The new plans for the launch have cut out the stations around USC.

For lawyer Randy Schoenberg, the Hollywood movie summer success Woman In Gold — which tells his story of how he helped a Jewish refugee sue the Austrian government and recover Nazi-looted artwork — is simply “icing on the cake.”
“It was winning the case that was the big deal,” said Schoenberg, who graduated from the Gould School of Law in 1991. Since suing the Austrian government, Schoenberg has turned his focus to his alma mater, twice suing the university and presently teaching a “Art and Cultural Property Law” course at the Gould School.
The Woman In Gold chronicles Schoenberg’s remarkable success recovering Nazi-looted art that had been in the Austrian government’s possession since Maria Altmann fled at the outbreak of WWII.
Altmann came to Schoenberg in 1998 to get his help in recovering six Gustav Klimt paintings that the Nazis had seized as a part of their persecution of the Jews in the lead up to WWII. Schoenberg said he was quite eager to help Altmann, who was Schoenberg’s grandmother’s closest friend.
In fact, Schoenberg clearly recalls the first time he learned of the connection between his family friend and the famous painting. As a teenager he went to the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna and saw the painting — referred to as the “Mona Lisa of Austria” — in person.
“I remember my mother showing me the painting and saying, ‘You know your grandmother’s friend, Maria Altmann? That’s her aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer,’” Schoenberg said. “I knew the painting, but I hadn’t even known that her family had owned the painting.”
The case had even greater personal significance, as Schoenberg’s great grandfather and dozens of other family members died in the Holocaust. His entire family had resided in Vienna before WWII, when his grandfather, famous composer Arnold Schoenberg, fled to America. Arnold’s first job in California was teaching music at USC.
After digging deep into the wills of both Adele and her husband Ferdinand, Schoenberg’s research proved that the art was taken illegally and that Ferdinand’s will — a valid and legally binding document — had left the art to Altmann and her sister, the couple’s only living heirs at the time of Ferdinand’s death.
When the law firm he worked for decided not to pull forward with the case, Schoenberg decided to quit his job and take the case on a contingency fee.
“There’s never any good time to make that type of huge career change to leave a big firm and go out on your own. But it was the next step in my life,” he said.
The case remained stalled, however, because the Austrian government refused to acknowledge the paintings were illegally stolen and put in the Belvedere gallery.
“[The Austrian government] just couldn’t put themselves in the position of what it would be like to the victim,” he said. “[It was so frustrating] because here is this chance for you — the Austrians of present society who didn’t do anything wrong during the war — to make the right choice. And yet you’re still perpetuating the bad decisions of the past.”
After exhausting all options in Austria, Schoenberg found a loophole that allowed him to sue the Austrian government in the United States court system. The case ended up going to the Supreme Court as the Republic of Austria v. Altmann in 2004.
The court ruled in Schoenberg and Altmann’s favor, essentially authorizing Altmann to move forward with a civil action against Austria in the U.S. federal court.
In an attempt to save time and energy, Schoenberg made a deal with the Austrian government to agree to an arbitration panel in Austria that finally decided in 2006 that the paintings were to be returned to Altmann and her family. Since then, the painting has been on display in Ronald Lauder’s Neue Galerie in New York City.
Despite the extremely positive outcome, Schoenberg had never really counted on winning the case.
“[The case] was fun to talk about at cocktail parties, but everyone thought I was tilting at windmills and that it was completely insane. And it was, but sometimes those things pay off, and I was very lucky that it did,” he said.
For the most part the film was quite accurate, Schoenberg said — except for the fact that Reynolds was named “People’s Sexiest Man Alive,” whereas Schoenberg has never particularly imagined himself that way.
For example, while Schoenberg’s wife did not go into labor as he was packing for his Supreme Court hearing, he did receive a call 36 hours before heading into the Supreme Court that his wife had been admitted to the hospital for preterm labor, he said.
Prior to his big case, Schoenberg got practice filing suits against big institutions when he sued his alma mater twice in 1995.
“I graduated from there, and then I sued them,” Schoenberg said.
 
The first case was personal to his family history. In 1995, USC was home to the Arnold Schoenberg Institute. However, in February 1995, the University approached the Schoenberg family to modify their contract, which would force the family to decrease their involvement in the center and relinquish control over the copyrights, Schoenberg said. Schoenberg sued the university and obtained two publicized preliminary injunctions that prohibited the school from using the Arnold Schoenberg Institute in violation of its agreement with the family’s heirs.
Schoenberg sued USC again the same year when football player Israel Ifeanyi was suspended by the NCAA for four games after he accepted money from his Nigerian tribe, Schoenberg said.
Ifeanyi had appealed his suspension, and was meant to have his hearing the Wednesday before the big USC-Notre Dame game. However, the NCAA cancelled the appeal last minute so that Ifeanyi would not have the chance to argue his case to play in the big game. Schoenberg sued the university and obtained a temporary restraining order against the NCAA that allowed Ifeanyi to play in the USC-Notre Dame game.
Even though he was technically suing the University, Schoenberg said it worked out in their best interest.
“For USC, my recollection is that they sort of wanted us to sue them. They had to be on the NCAA’s side, but they really wanted him to play,” he said.
Now teaching at USC, Schoenberg is passing down what he learned at his alma mater to his current students. Former student Stephanie Myer, who graduated from the Gould School in May, said that Schoenberg was “very open about the fact that he isn’t really an art lawyer.”
“He would always say, ‘It’s kind of funny that USC asked me to teach this class because I didn’t study [art law] in school, and I didn’t try to do this… It just kind of happened,’” Myer said.
Schoenberg said this is something he learned during his own time as a law student from USC’s interdisciplinary approach.
“A good lawyer is able to pick up and go wherever the client needs him or her. And that’s how USC prepared me and the rest of us for that kind of practice.”
Myer took Schoenberg’s class because it related to her focus in entertainment law. Right before the class began, the trailer for Woman in Gold came out.
“A friend of mine had posted it on Facebook, and I looked it up and was like, ‘Wait, that’s my teacher,’” she said. “He was so funny about [the film]. He was like, ‘Obviously I’m not Ryan Reynolds,’” and he casually left for a week in the semester to go to the movie’s premieres.”
After watching the film, Myer said that it was very exciting to see her professor’s real-world accomplishments on the big screen.
“I felt like I knew the real story, so it was cool to watch Hollywood’s take on it,” she said.

USC has changed its legal representation and brought its legal dispute with the University of California, San Diego to federal court in the latest of a series of developments in UCSD’s suit against the University. USC and UCSD are awaiting a trial that will decide who has rights to an Alzheimer’s research program.
USC’s lawyers filed for the removal of the institution’s legal dispute with UCSD shortly after San Diego Superior Court’s Judge Judith Hayes issued a preliminary injunction ordering the restoration of control over former UCSD researcher, Paul Aisen’s Alzheimer’s study to UCSD. The injunction also requires USC to avoid manipulation of lab data pulled from clinical trials all over the United States.
A court notice filed in Hayes’s court recognized that USC has hired Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a Los Angeles litigation-only law firm to replace the Costa Mesa Office of the Paul Hastings law firm.
The dispute began in July when Paul Aisen, head of the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study since 2003, moved to USC, bringing his research and data bank with him. The La Jolla university alleged that USC, Aisen and eight colleagues planned to take the research data of over 1,000 patients, along with other assets to the USC’s medical school.
However, Aisen said that USC was one of the institutions he approached when he started to consider universities that would provide the sort of administrative support and academic commitment to his field of research.
“USC has always had a commitment to research and neuroscience,” Aisen said. “I approached USC as a potential place that could offer. I had already been working with a number of faculty members at USC and so, I think USC was very open to the idea of my joining the institutions because it was consistent with USC’s commitment in this area.”
UCSD seeks financial damages and full ownership of the $100 million, nationwide project database.
Hayes’s order to return the research program to UCSD is currently in effect, but it is still being decided whether the case should move to federal court.
A main factor fueling USC’s contention is UCSD’s supposed failure to cite specific facts corroborating their allegations in the legal documents submitted to the state court judge.
UCSD has had control over the Alzheimer’s research program for nearly 25 years and still retains government funding with the backing of the National Institutes of Health.
Aisen said a reason for the switch was that UCSD lacked the proper resources necessary for the optimal continuation of his Alzheimer’s research program.
“UCSD did not have the support that we needed,” Aisen said. “Many efforts to improve the administrative environment never really accomplished what we needed, so that was the reason I considered other institutions.”
Both the University and Aisen deny any wrongdoing and argue that UCSD is only inhibiting a person’s freedom to switch jobs.
Aisen argued that the decision to file a lawsuit against USC sets a bad precedent for UCSD.
“Any university wants to be able to recruit successful faculty members,” Aisen said. “I don’t think that establishing this as a precedent, that faculty members must be loyal to the institution and may be sued if they leave — that’s not a good precedent for future recruitment.”
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Richard Seligman, associate vice president for research administration at the California Institute of Technology said researchers moving schools is not rare.
“It is common for researchers to jump from school to school and to receive permission from their original campus and funding agencies to take grants with them,” Seligman said.
“Universities are extremely collegial and collaborative and hardly ever get into disputes.”
Aisen expressed his certainty that the present complications will not have any serious effect on Alzheimer’s research in the long-run.
USC’s intention with taking Aisen and his colleagues aboard for the advancement of Alzheimer’s research has been in question, Aisen said. UCSD, among other public universities, worry that largely endowed private institutions like USC are offering higher salaries to talented faculty to better their position in the life sciences research fields.
Currently, UCSD, which received $390 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health last year, has a better reputation in this field than USC, according to U.S. News & World Report.
“We have to be at places where the conversations [in biomedicine] are the best. And San Diego is one of those places,” Provost Michael Quick said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.
I’m glad USC countersued.  Reviewing both the complaint and counterclaim, it is apparent UCSD is engaging in classic anti-trust behavior by doing everything in its power to prevent USC from competing in San Diego. UCSD is not immune to federal anti-trust laws.  It has been using code words like “lack of collaboration” and “buying its way” to describe USC’s efforts to establish a foothold in San Diego.  UCSD’s anti-competitive activities include contacting USC’s potential partners in La Jolla and elsewhere, entering into agreements with those entities and/or interfering with USC’s prospective business relationships.  UCSD is essentially trying to corner the life sciences market in San Diego.  That UCSD sued Dr. Aisen personally also speaks volumes about its tactics to destroy his personal financial credit.  USC did the right thing by suing UCSD’s medical dean, who has been the anti-competitive cheerleader for UCSD.  UCSD’s problem is that, for decades, it has overly depended upon federal and state taxpayers to fund research; its endowment is tiny and illustrates the school is too leveraged and dependent on federal tax dollars.  More importantly, by suing Dr. Aisen, UCSD is sending a clear but chilling message that it will sue other academics who come to UCSD and then, years later, decide to leave for greener pastures.  Further, that most of the companies that funded the subject Alzheimer’s research have followed Dr. Aisen’s team to USC speaks volumes as to the merits of Dr. Aisen’s claims that UCSD was poorly managing the funding and program, regardless of whether UCSD owns the relevant data. (And, btw, Dr. Aisen has a license and other rights to that data in at least two of the contracts at issue, so the claims he committed cyber crimes are wrong.)  Finally, Quinn Emanuel is one of L.A.’s most respected — and feared – litigation firms with a reputation for “scorched-earth” discovery tactics.  USC and Dr. Aisen’s team are in good hands.

The city of Los Angeles is not only a hub for film and television, but also contains a vast classical music scene. Though the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Hollywood Bowl are within close proximity to campus, some of the most satisfying performances can be found right at USC.
The Thornton School of Music ranks among the top 1 percent of music schools in the United States, and it lives up to these statistics. Thornton regularly produces professional-quality performances and attracts internationally respected artists for master classes and lectures. All Thornton events are free with a valid USC student ID, including the exciting classical performances the school will give this fall.
Thornton Symphony opens the Fall 2015 season on Sept. 11 with an ode to Russian composers. Principal conductor Carl St.Clair conducts the overture to Mikhail Glinka’s rarely heard opera Ruslan and Ludmilla, followed by Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 featuring renowned pianist Daniel Pollack, professor of Keyboard Studies. The evening concludes with Mussorgsky’s Suite Pictures at an Exhibition.
On Sept. 25, Thornton Symphony performs under the baton of Sharon Lavery in an evening that ranges from 19th-century German romanticism to mid-20th-century jazz. The program features Richard Strauss’s tone-poem Don Juan and Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring, and ends with Gershwin’s jazz-infused An American in Paris. All Thornton Symphony events are performed in Bovard Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
Though momentous, Thornton Symphony isn’t the only orchestral ensemble on campus; USC Thornton Edge, a collaboration that solely focuses on classical music composed in the modern era, also opens their season under director Donald Crockett in a program featuring Mark Anthony Turnage’s Kai for cello and ensemble, and Oliver Knussen’s Ophelia Dances. Thornton Edge events are held in Alfred Newman Recital Hall at 7:30 p.m.
As part of the Visions and Voices performance series, Thornton students will perform in “Music and Genocide: A Concert,” commemorating music that has, according to the event details, “resounded for social change in conflicts around the globe.” The concert will be held in Alfred Newman Recital Hall on Oct. 11 at 7:30 p.m. Though free to the public, a reservation is required and can be made online on the Visions and Voices’ website.
Also within the Visions and Voices series, a concert of songs written by composer Alan Smith, chair of Keyboard Studies and director of Keyboard Collaborative Arts, will be presented. Celebrated mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, baritone and Vocal Arts faculty member Rod Gilfry, and soprano Diana Newman will be joined by Smith at the piano in an evening of contemporary art song.      Newman, a Thornton alumna and current fellow with the Ryan Center of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, spoke about the set of songs she will be presenting.
“These songs are entirely about love,” Newman said. “Each song represents a different facet of love we as humans are hopefully lucky enough to experience… Romantic love, love we feel for our family, platonic love, or the love we have for our craft and inspiration.”
Newman, who collaborated with Smith many times as a student, credits much of her success to the compassionate nature of the Thornton School of Music.
“Being in a place where you are completely supported and supportive of those around you makes you a better colleague, a better performer, and gives you all the power instead of being controlled,” Newman said.
The concert will be held in Alfred Newman Recital Hall on Oct. 20 at 7:30 p.m. An online reservation is required.
Thornton’s Concert Orchestra will present Respighi’s Pines of Rome and Three Songs for Voice and Orchestra by Osvaldo Golijav, featuring Canadian-American soprano Katherine Giaquinto. Conducted by adjunct instructor Michael Powers, the concert will be held in Bovard Auditorium on Nov. 4 at 7:30 p.m. No reservation is required.
 
Just before Thanksgiving, USC Thornton Opera will present Mozart’s La Clemenza di Tito.  Resident music director for USC Thornton Opera Brent McMunn and resident stage director Ken Cazan collaborate with students from the Vocal Arts program and the USC Thornton Symphony to produce Mozart’s final opera seria.  The opera will be performed in Bing Theater on Nov. 19-21 at 8:00 p.m. and Nov. 22 at 2:00 p.m.  Free tickets can be obtained with student ID at the USC Ticket Office.

After deferring a year from college, Austin and Ally actress Laura Marano is coming to USC as a freshman this fall. Her Disney Channel show will air its finale this January, cueing the 19-year-old’s up-and-coming songwriting career along with her intended major of philosophy, politics and law.
“College was always in my future since I was a little girl. Both my parents are teachers, so education is really important to me,” Marano said. “I am in the unique situation of already doing the career I want to do for the rest of my life. I feel like I should take advantage of that and get a degree in something I truly just want to learn more about.”
The Los Angeles native chose to attend the university not only because of its proximity to home and her family, but also because of its relationship with mother and USC alumna, Ellen Marano.
“My mother not only was a Trojan, but was also a Song Girl,” Marano said. “So USC was one of my top choices from the beginning. After doing a tour and talking to a few of my friends who had gone there, I knew USC was 100 percent the school for me.”
Marano not only dedicates herself to her education but also to her work as a developing performer. Fellow actress and sister Vanessa Marano stars as Bay Kennish on the ABC Family original series Switched at Birth. Both sisters started working in show business when Vanessa was seven years old and Laura was five years old. Their mother, a former actress, did not support the influence of the entertainment industry early on in her daughters’ lives, so she reached out to an agent that would presumably reject them, yet the agent hired both of the remarkable girls.
Marano believes that growing up in show business came with an accelerated upbringing. As she dabbled in normal juvenile activities, such as performing in school plays and playing on a soccer team, the child actress acclimated herself to the adult environment at work. She says her standard childhood mixed with her more serious job on set gave her “a slightly different perspective of the world growing up.”
Maintaining her normal adolescent life presented a struggle when Marano decided to put her education on hold for Austin and Ally, which was renewed for its fourth and final season on Disney Channel earlier this year. The show, which has been on the air since 2011, gave her another family and another chance to showcase her singing and songwriting abilities as she wrote original compositions for the sitcom.
“I knew for a fact that we had one more season of Austin and Ally, and I really wanted to give that all my attention,” Marano said. “It was the first time I did not have to balance both school and my career.”
After dedicating three years to the show, the 2015 Kids Choice Awards Favorite TV Actress winner parted ways with her beloved cast and embarked on her collegiate journey.
“It was very bittersweet. I think the whole cast was definitely excited to move onto other things, but we also knew how much we were going to miss each other,” she said.
According to Marano, her fellow cast members weren’t just coworkers, they were family.
Marano said, “Because of Austin and Ally, I have gained lifelong friends and a second family. Saying goodbye to seeing these people every day was extremely difficult.”
Despite taking a break from the television industry, Marano has plans to pursue songwriting as she is currently making headway in producing her first solo album.
The star, along with her sister and mother, will be touring eight Australian cities this September and October to discuss the “behind the scenes” of show business and to sing snippets of her new music.
Australia is not the only country the singer is planning on visiting for promotional purposes. She recently traveled to Dubai for Dubai Summer Surprises, an annual summer festival where families flock to for bargains and celebrity appearances.
The Ibn Battuta Mall is only one of the many venues she plans to surprise her loyal fans with live concerts.
“I have always loved to write, so getting the opportunity to actually release music is so ridiculously awesome,” she said.
As one of the newest artists under Big Machine Records, which also produces Taylor Swift and Zac Brown Band, Marano has begun her journey to international stardom with tours in various countries, all the while maintaining new duties as a college student.
Marano acknowledged that juggling a budding music career and life as a college student can be difficult.
“It is for sure challenging work, but it is so worth it,”Marano said.

USC kicked off a new semester with its annual Welcome Back concert Saturday in McCarthy Quad. The event featured performances from artists KR, Post Malone and Cashmere Cat.
“Welcome Back is traditionally attended primarily by freshman,” said Judah Joseph, the director of USC Concerts Committee. “Our overarching goal for this was to attract more than just one grade at USC because everyone is entitled to this amazing welcome back experience, and we wanted people to come even if they were juniors or seniors.”
Joseph said this year’s Welcome Back Concert was the largest in a decade.
This year’s concert featured three performances, which is atypical for the Welcome Back concert.
“A lot of times in the past there’s two [artists], so we really wanted a strong, diverse lineup and I think we got that with the three artists that we have,” said Zoe Willis, the co-assistant director of Concerts Committee.
KR, an emerging California artist, opened the show promptly at 7 p.m. and performed for half an hour to a small but enthusiastic crowd of students that grew over the course of the evening.
“USC is the best school on earth, I feel so much love,” KR said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Do not ever think you can’t do whatever the hell you want to. My name is KR; thank you for having me.”
Post Malone’s performance was slightly delayed. He took the stage at 8:30 p.m. and finished shortly before 9 p.m. With the crowd chanting his name, Cashmere Cat took the stage shortly after 9 p.m.
Willis said planning for the concert began as early as May, with initial conversations focusing around potential performers.
“We came up with a list of 300 artists that we sourced from friends, e-board and [the directors], and from there we looked at their availability,” Willis said. “From there it was all about fit, making sure that the three [performers] were integrated — something that was diverse and fun for students — and, of course, within our budget.”
Joseph said coordinating between the artists can be an interesting challenge.
“It’s always a question of making sure the artists can accommodate the other artists’ scheduling,” Joseph said. “So when we put together a show like this and have three different acts, they all obviously need to know exactly what time we want them on stage, and so sometimes when we have different acts that want to make a small change — even if it’s only 10 minutes — we have to make sure all the other artists are okay with that time change.”
This year, the cost of security for the concert was covered by Student Affairs and not Concerts Committee — a change that USG advocated for last year.
“I think it’s going to be a heightened experience and a renewed one because security fees are being covered by Student Affairs, so we have more money to budget for events like this,” USG President Rini Sampath said. “That’s a huge role that USG played in making this concert better than previous years.”
Willis also said that having security costs covered enabled the committee to focus on programming.
“Year after year, USC always asks us to hire more security, which is definitely something we take into consideration because we want the events to be safe. But it does come at an extra cost to us, which cuts into the money that we have for talent,” Willis said. “So by USC covering that, that really helps us to book better artists and put on better shows.”
Reaction to the concert was mixed, with some students enjoying the combination of artists and others criticizing the lack of energy.
“It’s been pretty tame,” Donald Annarella, a junior majoring in public policy, planning and development, said. “The lineup wasn’t exactly inspiring, I thought it could have been better. I’m not sure who was available, but compared to past experiences it felt a little lackluster.”
Eduard Babayan, a senior majoring in biology, said he enjoyed the overall atmosphere.
“It’s been pretty good. Good vibes, good music,” Babayan said. “They had a good DJ [between performances].”
Looking ahead, Joseph said Concerts Committee is focused on Conquest, the annual concert held the week before the USC-UCLA rivalry game.
“We have to make Conquest bigger and better than Welcome Back, so that’s next on our list,” Joseph said. “And looking down the line, Springfest even more so than Conquest.”

Taco lovers didn’t have to wait until National Taco Day to get their taco fix — Angelenos were treated to the fifth Annual L.A. Taco Festival on Saturday. Eighteen different taco vendors gathered at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday to celebrate everyone’s favorite handheld dish. The event’s 11 sponsors, including Ford and the Los Angeles Lakers, came together to make the festival about more than just tacos. The sponsors worked to benefit Jovenes Inc., an organization aimed toward ending youth homelessness.
Lines quickly formed soon after the festival began, and despite the 80-degree weather, the crowd continued to grow as the day went on. The festival’s best tacos, all of which can be found in Los Angeles, are outlined below.
Best Veggie Taco: Los Ruizeñores’ Grilled Veggies Taco. Though there were several great contenders, Los Ruizeñores blew the competition out of the park for the Best Veggie Taco. For a vegetarian taco, it really brought the heat, both in temperature and taste. The veggies were warm, well-cooked and seasoned, and juicy enough to provide flavor, but kept the taco from getting soggy. The taco’s signature Sriracha Mayo gave it the perfect amount of spice and contrasted with the coolness of its fresh guacamole. This taco gets extra points for its tortilla — hand made and gluten free. Overall, Los Ruizeñores’ tacos were a great deal at two for $6.50.
 
Best Fusion Taco: Kogi Short Rib Taco. The best fusion taco was hands down the Kogi Short Rib Taco, a true fan favorite. Toward the beginning of the festival, at 1 p.m., the line for the Kogi truck was over an hour long and growing at an unimaginable rate. Kogi, which offers tacos with a Korean Barbeque twist, offered four tacos: Short Rib, Spicy Pork, Chicken and Tofu, perhaps all of which are deserving of their own prize. Despite initial reservations about the size of the line, the tacos were very much worth the wait and at a reasonable price of two for $6, or three for $8.50.
Best Fish Taco: Guerrilla Tacos’ Ahi Poke Tuna with White Miso. Guerrilla Tacos’ ahi poke tuna taco perhaps also doubled as “least bang for your buck.” At $8 per taco, the tiny ahi tuna taco was anything but small in flavor. The crunch of the tortilla perfectly accompanied the firmness and flavor of the ahi tuna, leaving nothing to be desired but more.
Most Interesting:  Guerrilla Tacos’ local baby squid with cannelli beans taco. This taco’s non-traditional, interesting mix of flavors and textures certainly earns the award for “most interesting.” The look of the taco was an immediate attention grabber, with a beautiful mix of the purple squid, red peppers and green salsa. While the squid served as the main attraction, the green salsa was really the true highlight of the taco with its spice and flavor. The combination of ingredients was a welcome surprise from the traditional taco. For $5 each, the taco was a bit pricey, but definitely worth a try.
Best Value: Homeboy Tacos. Homeboy was a certified hit at the L.A. Taco Festival, offering a varied menu and selection of tacos. Drawing a crowd big enough to rival Kogi, Homeboy customers were treated to a choice of pork carnitas, tinga, mole, pollo verde or veggie tacos at an unbeatable price of two for $4.50 or three for $6 (usually $2.50 per taco). While standouts of the Homeboy truck included the pork carnitas and veggie tacos, each taco on the menu brought its own taste and kick, offering traditional tacos to fans of authentic, original Mexican flavor.
