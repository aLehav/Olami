On April 2, a judge stated that the trial of Armond Armstead, a former USC defensive football player, may be pushed back to next year. Armstead claims that team doctors gave him medications that led to a heart attack and hurt his chances as an NFL player.

Currently, the trial is set for June 23, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos has asked the lawyers to think about new trial dates in March or June of 2015.
Palazuelos has pushed the lawyers to appoint a “discovery referee,” a retired judge who would evaluate all the motions that Palazuelos has been evaluating and provide insight to the trial judge.
Amstead filed his lawsuit against USC in August 2012, claiming that Dr. James Tibone and other doctors at USC required him to take Toradol multiple times without properly telling him about the possible consequences.
The lawsuit claims that USC knew that Armstead had a heart attack and deliberately withheld that he had been taking Toradol. Armstead is also suing SportsPharm Pharmaceuticals, who supposedly sold the Toradol to USC.
Robert Bale, Armstead’s attorney, claims that he thinks Armstead’s ongoing medical problems are related to the Toradol that he was administered while at USC.

I had a recent epiphany that ordering pizza needs to be a regular occurrence in my life. Given my usual gourmet habits, maybe then my dining habits would be equal to that of the average college student.

I usually order pizza from Pasta Roma and Rosso Oro’s because of their proximity to where I live. If, for whatever reason, they can’t deliver, I don’t have a problem picking it up — plus the pizza isn’t half bad. But I still want to satisfy my gourmet cravings, so as a result of this epiphany, I turned to Eater LA for some helpful information on the best pizza delivery places in Los Angeles. Eater compiled a list of the best places to order pizza, but I narrowed it down to the top three that are in close proximity to campus.
If time and money are an issue, you can make pizza from scratch. I make homemade pizza all the time and, as USC students, we are lucky enough to have Fresh & Easy nearby because they sell ready-made pizza dough. If Fresh & Easy is too much of a trek, you can make your own homemade pizza dough using a two-ingredient recipe from The Slow Roasted Italian — all you need is Greek yogurt and self-rising flour. Have at it.
To make pizza, all you really need is your pizza dough; standard pizza ingredients such as shredded mozzarella cheese, pepperoni slices and tomato sauce — and some sort of oven. I bake my pizza at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. After that, just let it cool and then it’s ready to serve.
I encourage you to make or order some pizza — the more the merrier.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  That is all.
There is only one nationwide release this weekend, and it’s a big one. The new Captain America film is yet another continuation of the impressive Marvel Universe that Disney has been able to create over the past couple years. Starring Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Redford and Anthony Mackie, the film has a star-studded cast that shows how devoted Disney is to this superhero franchise.
While by no means the most popular Avenger (that title is reserved for Iron Man), expect this film to absolutely obliterate the box office this weekend. As one of the most lucrative franchises in film history, any film from the Marvel Universe is practically a guaranteed money-maker.
But don’t be fooled simply by its blockbuster numbers and the trailer that depicts widespread destruction. The film has received very positive reviews so far, many praising its political astuteness. This film is more than just a simple action flick.
The interconnectedness between the Marvel films has a lot to do with their popularity.  The entire franchise is an ambitious project by Disney to create a film experience that expands across multiple film franchises. Expect a teaser for The Avengers: Age of Ultron or even Guardians of the Galaxy within Captain America: Winter Soldier.
As the only new release of the weekend, Captain America should rake in all of the viewers.   Last week’s winner, Noah, took in more money than projected, but it should pale in comparison to the money that Captain America will make.
One notable limited release this weekend, which will not factor into the box office numbers, is Under the Skin. Adapted from the Michel Faber novel of the same name, it stars Scarlett Johansson in the lead role. The film has received positive reviews thus far and could be a good alternative for moviegoers who are looking for something besides superheroes and massive explosions.
