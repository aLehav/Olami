At the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, Michael Chasalow saw small businesses in Los Angeles County struggle to navigate changing guidelines and regulations as they tried to reopen and keep their businesses afloat. 
When Chasalow, a professor of clinical law and director of the Gould School of Law’s Small Business Clinic, received questions from these businesses, he developed the idea to create the Small Business Legal Research Task Force. 
“Quarantine started slowly … and the rules that govern it weren’t entirely clear,” Chasalow said. “I became aware pretty quickly that businesses had small and big questions about how to navigate through this completely unprecedented time.”
With students losing internships because of the pandemic, Chasalow said many reached out to him for ways to help the community while bettering their research skills, and the task force presented the perfect opportunity.
From contractual obligations to directives on “price gouging,” the task force’s website provides nuanced answers to questions that small businesses are currently grappling with, and a separate form allows them to submit new questions that arise. 
Chasalow further stated the importance of being responsive to the specific needs of small businesses. 
“What we tried to do is take a smaller vision rather than a bigger vision,” Chasalow said. “It was a desire to answer the more basic questions facing the business, as opposed to the kind of the global issues that might face many businesses.” 
Chasalow said local businesses have reached out to thank him for the help that the website provided them. With the changing local, county and state guidelines, Chasalow said it has been challenging to consistently update the website. 
However, he said that to address some of the changes that have been made since the students last worked on the website, they’ll be updating the site in October and at various checkpoints as long as the pandemic persists.
The website went through multiple fact-checking rounds by student supervisors and Chasalow who reviewed the FAQ pages and the sample templates for letters to creditors and customers. 
Elizabeth Bell, a second-year law student and another supervisor on the project, said the students also focused on simplifying language from state and local orders so that more people could understand it.
Compiling the pertinent legal ordinances and resources was challenging. 
“When I was researching questions there were so many different sources and so much information out there, it’s hard to see what’s actually relevant,” Bell said. 
Bell also credited her time with the task force to giving her a hands-on experience that taught her to write about issues and ordinances with language that her clients can understand.
Behind the scenes, the website also required technical work that enabled it to run efficiently. Ariel Jacoby, another second-year law student, used her experience working in digital marketing to help design the website and facilitate its workflow. 
Jacoby said it was important for her to help small businesses that do not have resources to access legal advice, and she referred some of her friends who own businesses to the site as well. 
“Small businesses don’t have a big firm on retainer that they’re able to go to with their legal questions,” Jacoby said. “This website is able to be that resource for business owners.”

The Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly and International Student Assembly released a joint statement Tuesday denouncing USC’s transparency on the removal of Marshall School of Business professor Greg Patton. The letter also brought attention to the “pressing issues that have been ignored by the USC administration,” including student complaints of discriminatory language and action used by three other USC professors in their classrooms. 
The statement comes after Patton was criticized for his use of a Chinese word that resembled the pronunciation of an English racial slur in an Aug. 20 lecture. His class, “Communication for Management,” covered oral presentation skills and how to maximize one’s professional value. 
In the lecture, Patton discussed the common use of filler words, such as “um” or “err” in English, and followed with an example of the Chinese word, 那个, which in Mandarin is commonly pronounced nèi ge (NAY-guh) or nà ge (NAH-guh). As Patton suggested, the term, which literally translates to “that,” is commonly used among Chinese speakers and functions as the Chinese equivalent of the English filler word, “um.”
Following the lecture, an Aug. 21 email sent  to Marshall Dean Geoffrey Garett, signed by Black MBA candidates from the class of 2022, said that Patton repeatedly used the word during class sessions and would pause the Zoom recording before saying the word and then recording again. 
“Several students during the lecture brought up this inappropriate use of Na-Ga, and in subsequent core courses he still used the same example,” the MBA candidates’ letter read. “His disregard to the impact of his use of the Mandarin example on Black students also led us to believe this was not the first instance of using this thought-less comment.”
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Patton said that it was a misunderstanding as the class was coming out of a breakout session, and he forgot to restart the recording.
In response to the criticism, Patton expressed his apologies to his students in an email Aug. 26, recognizing that students were hurt and disturbed with the phrase he used in class. In the email, he said that he has taught the course for nearly 10 years, and the example used in class was given by international students years ago. Patton said he added the example because he tries to include global and diverse perspectives in his classrooms. 
The Undergraduate Student Government programming organizations cited in their letter that, although they did not take issue with Patton’s use of the word, they believe that the professor also displayed his “ignorance and privilege” by not providing context to explain how it may be interpreted. However, the situation extends beyond Patton’s dismissal, the letter read. 
“USC’s response centered a white man’s experience in a broader conversation about race and diversity when it should have focused on voices of its affected communities,” the organizations wrote. “They spoke for Black students while not addressing other pressing concerns at a time when anti-Black actions and sentiments are prevalent.” 
The letter also addressed the alienation of international students from China — as “one of the largest yet most unheard populations on campus” —  and of Asian Pacific Islander and Desi American students via the events of Patton’s departure from the class and who have experienced heightened xenophobia amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
“Greg Patton’s situation is not an isolated incident,” the letter read. “USC’s actions do not ‘fix anything,’ nor do they serve the needs of its marginalized communities who have already experienced discrimination and prejudice on a variety of fronts. Greg Patton is only the tip of the iceberg for an administration that has repeatedly neglected student reports for even more flagrant offenders. Taking rapid action on Greg Patton in this situation and not previously reported incidents was both performative and hypocritical.” 
USC’s inaction with informing students and the general public on Patton’s situation has also led to confusion with various right-wing media outlets being the first to report on the events and “manipulate the narrative,” APASA, BSA and ISA wrote. 
According to the letter, students have filed complaints against Thornton School of Music professor Parmer Fuller, who was alleged to have used the n-word in his classes, former Marshall professor Greg Autry, where student complaints have stated that he used Sinophobic rhetoric in his classroom and on LinkedIn and School of Pharmacy professor Joel Hay who was alleged by student complaints to have spread “untrue and repugnant stereotypes about Vietnamese students.” The University has yet to take any disciplinary action against the named faculty members. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Fuller stated that his use of the n-word was based on quoting lyrics from American music of the 1800s and that his class, as one based on the history of musical theatre, is “unfortunately … ingrained in racism.” According to Fuller, he has since stopped using the word and asking exam questions on offensive lyrics in exams, per the requests of his students, and apologizes to Black students that he has offended. 
Autry refused to comment on the allegations to the Daily Trojan. Hay did not respond in time for publication.
APASA, BSA and ISA are also calling for transparency from the USC Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX. Numerous student complaints to the office have received limited updates, according to the letter.
USC declined to comment further on the Patton situation and the letter from the programming organizations.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, co-executive director of BSA Calvin Carmichael said he wished USC could directly apologize to both the Black and Asian populations at USC. 
“I’m going to be in support of the students who felt uncomfortable [in Patton’s class] because as a student, you shouldn’t have to go through that,” Carmichael said. “I am not going to say I necessarily feel bad for [Patton] getting suspended because it wasn’t like he had to use [the word], he isn’t a part of either of these cultures where it was OK for him to use it in the sense of him using it appropriately or in the sense of him trying to offend another culture — he’s a white man, he’s not Black or Asian. He could have used a different example.”
Shortly after news circulated of Patton’s dismissal from teaching the course, many students posted their frustration online. 
Joe Altaffer, a junior majoring in business administration, felt inclined to express their opinion on a Reddit thread, citing the University’s lack of research in understanding the difference of meanings across different languages and cultures. As a native Mandarin speaker, Altaffer said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that Patton’s pronunciation of the phrase was partially incorrect but phonetically used the word properly to represent “that.” However, the pronunciation of “nà ge” versus “nèi ge” depends on the accent regional dialect, and is used interchangeably.    
“I feel as though Dean Geoff Garrett, President Carol Folt and the USC administration [have] shown major cultural insensitivity to the Chinese community,” Altaffer said. “We are sadly shifting focus on real social justice within the Trojan community and instead punishing someone who does not truly deserve it.”
Tiger He, a first year graduate student studying computer science and artificial intelligence and who first heard about Patton’s removal through news coverage, said he believes the decision to remove Patton from the classroom was inappropriate. He also said he feared that, if a professor can be accused in this matter, other Chinese speakers would also become victims for speaking the language. 
“By pausing the professor’s teaching simply because he said a word in Chinese in this class, especially under the proper context, really hurts the feeling of the Chinese international students, and the Chinese speaking community here at USC,” He said. 
A circulating petition that surfaced Sept. 4 also demands Patton’s reinstatement. The petition has amassed more than 25,000 signatures at the time of publication from alumni, students and others who believe Patton should be reinstated. 
“The context of this discussion was clearly an academic lecture on communication and Professor Greg Patton was describing a universal mistake commonly made in communication,” the petition read. “For him to be censored simply because a Chinese word sounds like an English pejorative term is a mistake and is not appropriate, especially given the educational setting. It also dismisses the fact that Chinese is a real language and has its own pronunciations that have no relation to English.”
CC Chen, who created the petition, is not affiliated with USC and declined an interview with the Daily Trojan because he did not believe his voice should represent the views of the students. 
Katherine Owojori, one of the petition signers, said that she was frustrated with the University’s efforts to address the reason for Patton’s removal because it felt disingenuous and considered its intentions xenophobic.
“There’s been several former [USC] Black students on campus who have set lists of demands for USC to fulfill to help feel more safe and accepted on campus” said Owojori, a sophomore majoring in political science. “But, none of those have [USC] decided to address first.” 
In an email to the Daily Trojan Sept. 5, the Marshall School stated that it recognizes the historical and harmful impact of racial slurs and is offering support to students who are impacted. The school also clarified that Patton is taking a pause while another professor teaches the course, but continues to teach his other University courses.
“USC is committed to building a culture of respect and dignity where all members of our community can feel safe, supported and can thrive,” the statement read.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Marshall academic director Peter Cardon said the Marshall Faculty Council conducted a survey sent to Marshall faculty members to collect their views on the matter. The Council is currently reviewing responses and is preparing a report to the dean and hope to keep the matter internal.
Alumni Gregory Ware, who graduated with an Executive MBA, took two of Patton’s classes when he was at USC in 2017 and 2018 and said he does not believe Patton’s use of the word had malicious intent. He said Patton used the same word in his class several years ago, but students didn’t react negatively.
“I am someone who has been called the n-word one too many times,” Ware said. “I have been unfortunately exposed to and had to deal with toxic work environments with passive aggression with a racial undercurrent. I can tell you that this particular example doesn’t come close to, what takes place and frankly, in corporate America far too often.”
At the time of publication, Patton has not been informed by Marshall on whether he will resume his teaching position in the “Communications for Management” class. Patton will continue to teach his other classes at Marshall in Spring 2021.

Netflix’s newest addition to its original movie collection, “Enola Holmes,” is a story based on Nancy Springer’s novels of the same title. This story exists in the world of the age-old character Sherlock Holmes but now takes a look at the lives of his mother, Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter), and genius sister, Enola (Millie Bobby Brown), in a fun and nuanced way. 
Although Enola and her mother have to deal with the shadow Sherlock’s (Henry Cavill) reputation casts on them, these strong female characters do an impressive job of distinguishing themselves from the overtold story of their brother and son by being confident and full of personality. The best scenes were the ones with Enola showing the funnier yet intelligent side of her character. These characters not only prove to be well written and witty, but also seem to have an elevated understanding of the world not held by male characters, with lines such as, “Paint your own picture, Enola. Don’t be thrown off course by other people. Especially men.” In essence, this is the story of a smart young woman navigating a world that is set against her.
Before watching the film, I was a bit cautious about how it would be done, considering Netflix’s track record in movies; after all, “The Kissing Booth” (and its sequel) and “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before” (and its sequel as well) don’t exactly get my hopes up for how well Netflix can write female-driven plots. This is to say that “Enola Holmes” actually surprised me. I partially expected it to be just another Sherlock Holmes movie, except with Millie Bobby Brown, yet I found that it had good writing, excellent characterization and important themes. 
Taking the path set by the men around you and instead doing what you are passionate about is a prominent theme sprinkled throughout the film. Scenes such as Enola outsmarting her brothers and fighting men much older than her work to prove her intelligence and skill and send home the message that, even though the people around her expect little of her because of her gender, she is more independent and astute than credited. This theme is also represented in real life. As lead actress and star of critically acclaimed “Stranger Things,” Millie Bobby Brown actually helped produce the film alongside her older sister after having read the series and being inspired to play the role. 
The main plot revolves around the mother-daughter relationship between Eudoria and  Enola. On Enola’s 16th birthday, her mother disappears with only a few clues left behind that are addressed to her daughter. Against the wishes of her strict older brothers, she runs away to find their mother. While choosing to pursue her mother, she crosses paths with possibly the most British-named man ever, Lord Viscount Tewksbury (Louis Partridge). This creates a whole new storyline where she must investigate why someone has been sent to kill the lord and leads to a romantic subplot. 
Throughout the film, Enola faces conflict with her two brothers, namely Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin), who seems to see Enola as more of a potential problem as opposed to a sister from the first second of meeting her. He plays one of the main antagonists that impedes Enola’s journey to track down her mother by insisting that Enola be sent to finish school for formal education. This was based on his desire to maintain his social standing and his immense hatred for women. 
Seriously, every scene with Mycroft includes him either insulting his sister or just being outright mean and unreasonable to anyone. One of his lines is, “Reform. God help us. If there’s one thing this country doesn’t need, it’s more uneducated voters,” so it’s established very clearly that he is elitist and close-minded. It was a good detail to make Mycroft so outwardly antagonistic because when Enola escapes him flawlessly (not just once but several times) it’s very satisfying and reinforces the confidence portrayed by the women in this film. 
On the other hand, there are valid criticisms of this adaptation such as how the film (like most Netflix originals) seems to have an element that is a little too cliche. There were a handful of jokes that added nothing to the movie and would have been better left out, and some of the characters were made to be somewhat static in order to uphold the messages of the film. 
Also, some would argue that the film invalidated its own message by having a romantic subplot for the main character which diverted her from her previous goals, thus changing her path in life for a man. However, he seemed less malicious and more ignorant, and in his character she saw a path she could craft for herself in saving him and remaining free of finishing school, rather than a path laid out by her mother. In doing so, she stayed true to the message of the film. 
All in all, what the film lacked in originality, it made up for in humor and character writing. As a woman, I resonate strongly with the messages of how women should be able to pursue their interests and passions regardless of men’s standards.

Among the day-to-day changes that this year has brought, when I now video call my parents,  they are practically indiscernible. Under the disposable surgical gowns and the extensive layers of facial coverings, they resemble not themselves but the millions of health care professionals around the nation, searching within themselves daily for the Herculean effort necessary to help those in need.
The price is high, but the reward is worth their while, I am told. 
The development of this pandemic has placed inordinate amounts of stress upon the nation’s workforce, but immigrant workers have always been “essential” to the livelihood of our communities. From the immigrant farm workers travailing through hot days in the sun to my parents’ promoting United States health as a personal mission, it’s almost paradoxical to entertain the negative stereotyping of immigrants in the United States. 
This past week, I saw a series of images in The Guardian of farmers in California, and they only served to solidify the essential nature of immigrant work. Against a backdrop of orange-tinted skies, farm workers picked fresh produce as ash was carried down by the scorching late-summer air. The world as we know it today relies on the more than 381,000 farmworkers yielding the produce we use in our daily meals. 
The recent wildfires brushing up and down the West Coast have been devastating for us all, but for those whose day jobs ensure their communities have food on the table, the situation becomes a double-edged sword: choosing between their health and their paycheck, along with the fate of the U.S. food supply. 
My own job as a restaurant host became an essential service in March, though it remains a humble entry-level position. The hour requirements and precautionary measures involved with my two part-time gigs changed drastically in the spring and have remained this way ever since. 
The changing landscape of the U.S. workforce relies so heavily on immigrant labor and we would be remiss as a country and as a community to dismiss this demographic so easily. Immigrant work is essential work, no matter how small or large the task at hand. 
In seeing the news clips and knowing what it is to be an immigrant worker in the United States, it gave me pause — why did I feel the need to emphasize and defend this idea? The idea of an immigrant worker in the United States has long held a negative connotation. 
I know this because I’ve heard it said to me, and I’ve heard it said about others like me. The rhetoric that immigrant laborers rob the born-and-bred U.S. citizen of job opportunities is one that has held a lot of weight with me. 
I have heard countless iterations of this sentiment, of the many subtle microaggressions toward immigrants that stand on shaky, emotion-driven bases. As a natural-born citizen who came to the United States as a young girl, I was grateful to have the background to see both sides. 
In sitting with this thought and reading what I could about it, what I found was that the harmful dialogue directed toward immigrants stems from a fear of the unknown. Masked under the guise of nationalism and spurred by provocative speech in the media, this current of thought is unfounded and lacks factual evidence. 
The popular talking points have all but been debunked in recent years. In a Public Broadcasting Service article I read, writer Gretchen Frazee brought together a culmination of resources that explore the most widely circulated myths about immigration. From the words of high-ranking university professors and bipartisan research organizations, the evidence depicted a very different scenario than what was being presented in media sources. 
The article reported that immigrant workers were more likely to take up professions not largely desired by natural-born citizens. Additionally, the New American Economy found a 15% higher likelihood that immigrant laborers would work unusual hours as compared to their natural-born U.S. counterparts. The figurative theft of U.S. jobs is a tactic intended to divide, because immigrants actually complement their natural-born colleagues by filling in gaps in the workforce. 
Now more than ever, immigrant work is vital to the health of our economy and our communities. Immigrant laborers make up a very large part of our communities’ unsung heroes, and their work is undoubtedly significant in the adjustment from our pre-pandemic lives to society as it operates today. 
While denigrating comments might be said here and there about those who carry out the work, it is unarguable that immigrants are essential to how this country runs. Whether you hold those sentiments or not, it would be worth our while to consider the sacrifices people of our communities make with us in mind. 
The individual who picked the food you eat, the one who manufactured the clothes you wear and the health care worker who carried out your coronavirus test may very well be immigrant workers. An adjective shouldn’t change the value of essential work and essential people.

Before I say anything else, I need to make something clear: LeBron James is not — and has never been — the greatest basketball player of all time.
That’s not to say that he isn’t an all-time great, or that he’s not even in the top two, because in my opinion, he is in the top two. He’s just not really close to No. 1 at all right now.Of course, when you’re that close to being the best ever, there are naturally going to be people who argue that LeBron is the best. And yes, everybody is also entitled to their own opinion.
If the Los Angeles Lakers do not win this year’s NBA Finals — or even fall in the Western Conference Finals, for that matter — all of this “GOAT” talk surrounding LeBron James must stop. Immediately.
I might get some hate for this, but let me explain myself here. Firstly, we must establish that Michael Jordan is the greatest of all time primarily for the following reason: He never lost when it mattered most.
That’s right. I’m going with the 6-0 finals argument, but there’s more to the story than just the record.
In those six series, Jordan never went to a Game 7. His path to the championship every single year was no joke: Reggie Miller, Patrick Ewing, Isiah Thomas, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Chris Webber, Dikembe Mutombo — and that’s just the Eastern Conference. He doesn’t have the most rings, but he has the most Finals MVP awards by winning in all six appearances. He averaged the most points in both regular season and playoff history with 30.12 and 33.45 per game, respectively.
The list goes on and on, but remember, he retired in the middle of his prime. He had to train his body to play a completely different sport, and once he started getting into peak baseball shape, he decided to completely retrain his body for basketball. And when he did, he was, of course, on top again.
Let’s look at LeBron’s legacy now in comparison. LeBron has taken his teams to the Finals nine times — three more than Jordan — but only has half the rings to show for it. LeBron has never won an NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and hasn’t made All-Defensive First Team since 2013. His career player efficiency rating is lower than Jordan’s.
What’s more, LeBron’s toughest competition in the East en route to an NBA championship was Paul George and the Indiana Pacers in 2013. Sorry, PG-13, but you’re no Reggie Miller just yet.
Of course, LeBron has his accolades: most points in the playoffs, third-most all-time points, eighth-most all-time assists and 13 All-NBA First Team selections. But these don’t nearly add up to what Jordan accomplished. Period.
If you want to define “greatest” by who would win in a one-on-one matchup in their prime, the comparison obviously changes, but we’ll also never definitively know the answer. LeBron’s size and frame are enough to advocate for his case, but Jordan’s excellent shooting and defense might be too much to handle.
LeBron needs a positive Finals record to be considered better than Jordan. Since he entered the league at the very young age of 18, LeBron is able to get more years on the court than the average superstar, thus more full years than Jordan (remember his retirement). But, in the end, it’s all about winning when it matters most.
LeBron has had significant help on his teams as well: Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were all on his championship-winning rosters. Now, in addition to having Jason Kidd as an assistant coach, he has Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Rajon Rondo and the legend himself Alex Caruso right alongside him.
There’s no excuse why someone who many claim is the GOAT shouldn’t be able to win at least a majority of their Finals appearances.
So, under no circumstance should the basketball world consider LeBron James to be the greatest of all time if he has a 3-7 Finals record, or if this year’s exciting and tenacious Denver Nuggets squad, led by Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic, pull off an upset in the Western Conference Finals.
If the Lakers fall to a young team such as the Nuggets, Boston Celtics or Miami Heat, LeBron’s potential to surpass Jordan will fall through and likely be remembered as nothing but an empty promise.

Whether USC chooses to continue online classes through the end of the school year or opts for a hybrid model of teaching, tuition cannot remain stagnant. Paying the full price again for a quarter of the experience (at best) is financially senseless.
Simply put — students won’t accept the exorbitant price tag. 
USC should seriously consider lowering tuition and fees by adapting its pricing model to charge in-person classes differently than online ones. If that is not the case, many students may likely take gap years to work, pursue internships or delay their graduation date and ultimately get back their “lost semester” when things return to normal. 
Current seniors who wish to experience a traditional graduation ceremony and international students, for whom campus is a cultural experience that extends far beyond academics, are the most likely to choose these alternatives. In fact, some students throughout the country and the world have already done it this semester. Newly admitted students will be able to fulfill their General Education requirements (which, unlike most other courses, are transferable to USC) at community colleges, potentially in person.
The issue that USC (and other universities around the country) claim to have with cutting tuition is that they simply cannot afford it or that doing so would weaken their financial position. In a joint statement to the USC community in June, Provost Charles Zukoski and James M. Staten, USC’s Chief Financial Officer revealed that the University had incurred between $300 million and $500 million in losses since the start of the pandemic.
These losses might sound really high if we consider that campus has been inoperational for six months now and will likely be out of commission for at least another semester. But this is because the University’s operating costs are not very flexible. 60% of them consist of personnel costs (salaries, wages and benefits), which the University has resolved to maintain. 
And savings on the remaining 40% of these costs while campus was closed apparently couldn’t compensate for the unexpected costs of transitioning to online learning and containing the spread of the coronavirus on campus.
Unfortunately, despite the University’s efforts to close its budgetary cap — such as cutting salaries in the administration; pausing merit increase, discretionary expenses and capital projects; and asking schools, academic units and administrative offices to review their budgets for potential efficiencies — it seems unlikely that USC’s financial situation will improve anytime soon. Housing occupancy might not go up until Spring 2021 and new enrollments, specifically of international students faced with travel restrictions, could drop. In the current economic climate, private donations and returns from investments could also decline.
That being said, students shouldn’t bear the brunt of USC’s financial complications any more than the University itself. Many are losing their jobs and cannot make loan payments or borrow money. Students are graduating into a precarious job market and will likely struggle to find employment. Current students are losing their work-study opportunities on campus or can only log a fixed set of hours. 
USC should use its assets during this time. Of course, it is important for a university to grow its assets to improve campus buildings and academic programs, and drawing from this precious reserve when the University’s financial position has already deteriorated is risky. 
However, net asset losses are not unprecedented. Between the 2018-19 fiscal year, for example, the University’s financial statements show that the school’s net assets decreased by $81 million (from approximately $9.27 billion to $9.19 billion), as operating expenses exceeded operating revenues and capital appreciations. 
According to the same financial statements, USC has access to a little over $2.3 billion worth of financial assets, meaning they can be converted to cash within a year. These readily-available assets exclude endowment funds that are designated for specific uses (for faculty, academic programs, scholarships or buildings, for example) by donors and the Board of Trustees for specific uses. USC’s $5.73 billion endowment is in fact invested, and only the interests it generates as well as the capital gains it enables the University to realize can be spent. 
As of fiscal year 2019, the University also had access to lines of credit in the amounts of $500 million. However, in a COVID financial FAQ on its website, the University has already made it clear that it isn’t willing to further jeopardize its financial health by borrowing at high interest rates. 
As for the endowment, USC has also indicated it isn’t willing to spend it during the crisis, insisting that this is not how the funds are supposed to be used.  
In any case, it is important to know that a special provision in the notes attached to the University’s fiscal year 2018 financial statements says that the Board of Trustees could modify how the endowment funds (or proceeds from investments of these funds) can be earmarked under exceptional circumstances. 
Of course, making sure that gifts keep on giving by reinvesting them makes sense from a financial standpoint. It even benefits students; indeed, the stable source of income it constitutes allows the University to build outstanding infrastructure and amenities for students, offer world-class academic programs and sponsor research, while only charging students for the cost of day-to-day operations. And drawing on the endowments funds threatens that very source of income. 
Nonetheless, our priorities have changed. Accumulating capital to continuously improve and develop the university makes sense under normal circumstances, but is a financial aberration when it leads the University to charge students the same tuition when campus is open and when it is closed. Not only does it defy the laws of supply and demand, but it is also at odds with students’ current preoccupations. The priority is to make sure all students can get the education they are seeking, which can already be a financial challenge, in addition to being an academic one. Everything else is secondary.
