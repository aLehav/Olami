Imagine: You’re up for a minimum wage 9-to-5 job where all you’re really looking forward to is your biweekly direct deposit. You’ve been accepted, and now all that awaits you are the dreaded, incomprehensible tax forms and, wait, drug testing? 
If you’re like me, you’ve probably panic-searched, “how long until cannabis is out of your system” on more than a few occasions. Following the abysmal results (that edible you took two weeks ago says “hi” and continues to haunt you post-high), you might also look up “how to pass a drug test weed.” 
Drug testing, particularly for cannabis, which is now medically legal in 39 states and territories, 13 of which also allow for legal adult use recreationally, is a relic of ancient times. 
Of course, no employer wants an inebriated worker on their team, least of all when the job requires operating heavy machinery, working with children or performing heart surgery. However, just as there are ways to detect if an employee is drunk at work, there are also surefire signs (if not smells) that point to if someone is on another astral plane or not — neither of which require a person to divulge their personal life and decisions outside of the workplace. 
At least, that’s how it should be. 
Take Illinois as an example. As of 2020, cannabis is recreationally legal in the state for those over the age of 21. As in any state, Illinois employers have the right to fire anyone who is using a substance while at work, and they can do so after ascertaining an employee’s impairment via an alcohol breathalyzer or drug test. While the former immediately informs you if someone is drunk or not (although these are also incredibly faulty, as widely reported), drug tests don’t work that way, only letting you know if someone has used substances in the past — up to a month depending on the person’s usage and drug of choice.
So while Illinois’ new regulations allow for people to light up on their own time, prohibiting employers from discriminating against people for their cannabis usage, they simultaneously enforce zero-tolerance policies, allowing employers to mandate drug-free workplaces. So if you don’t pass a drug test, whether scheduled or random, there’s a high chance you’re going to lose your job.
But this logic just applies to Illinois-only jobs. Federally contracted, licensed or funded positions or those that require extra focus on safety precautions, such as truck driving, piloting or engineering, require drug testing since cannabis is still federally illegal. USC students, you’ll know this well: Although cannabis is recreationally legal in California, we are prohibited from using cannabis on University grounds.
Essentially, the same logic that was once used (and can still be used, up to law enforcement’s discretion) to raid legal cannabis dispensaries in California is now being leveled on the individual. 
Stuck in a legal gray area completely fabricated by the state, workers who hold valid medical licenses now have to choose whether to consume cannabis for personal health reasons or risk the termination of their employment. Even without prescriptions, however, what ends up happening is akin to the state-sanctioned control of a person’s behavior beyond the workplace, whereby what you choose to do in your free time can and will be used against you. 
What becomes even more cumbersome is navigating how these measures are enforced, with individuals taking their complaints to court and receiving mixed results. States are interpreting statutes differently across the board — while some initially side with employers, others uphold employees’ rights. 
Additionally, considerable discretion is left up to the employer, with some choosing to overlook cannabis in drug testing. From 2015 to 2018, the number of drug tests performed that included cannabis decreased nationwide, though most prominently in recreationally legal states.
In the sports world, a similar trend has emerged. The NFL decided in April to forgo suspending players who test positive for cannabis. Testing will also be limited to a timespan of two weeks during training, and the threshold for what constitutes a positive test will be increased fourfold. The regulations allowed the league to catch up to the NBA, MLB and other leagues that had previously eased their restrictions on cannabis use for athletes. 
It’s clear that federal and state regulators have not a single iota of understanding how cannabis works, nor the delineation between respecting one’s privacy and ensuring a safe, efficient workplace. Nationwide lags in cannabis legalization create confusing labyrinths that place the burden on the individual to navigate what can and cannot potentially cost them their livelihoods. 
Just as doctors are allowed a glass of wine when they’re not on-call, who’s to say they shouldn’t relax after a hard day of work with a CBD gummy or blunt? Ultimately, I’m not here to debate the logistics of how to prove someone is or isn’t high at work, as it is evident the science behind this is leaps and bounds away from where it should be. Rather, I’m more interested in why governments and companies believe it’s their business how their employees unwind outside of work hours. Perhaps I’m wrong, but it seems like jealousy to me.

Let’s be honest — California is the dream. Whether you have lived here your whole life or moved here for college, there’s nothing like basking in the Los Angeles sun and taking a deep, cleansing breath of that ubiquitous smoggy air. We live in constant fear of a massive earthquake, experienced an extreme statewide drought for nine straight years, and since January of this year, nearly 3.6 million acres of the state have been on fire. 
For comparison’s sake — one acre of land is just over 75% of the length of a football field. For my non-football-understanding readers, a more palatable visual likens one acre to 2,787,840 chicken nuggets. Regardless, an acre is a lot of land. Although our state’s record-breaking drought has technically ended, massive heat waves, weather, the pandemic and politics have led to one of the most extreme wildfire seasons the West Coast has ever seen. 
Walking on the University’s campus, breathing in the ashy air, and looking up at the crimson sun and hazy gray sky is almost nostalgic. Growing up in San Diego, I was evacuated from my house in 2007 when the Witch Creek fire burned over 300 houses in my hometown alone. Fires and extreme heat have caused power outages in my town, and I’ve had to pack my belongings in case of an evacuation more than once. 
Fires are an integral part of the western United States, but the rapidly increasing pattern of extreme blazes should not be. While California has a historically dry, Mediterranean climate with gusty winds and low humidity, there is no denying that the changing climate has only made the state more prone to large fires. Hotter and drier temperatures year-round result in less moisture for vegetation, creating the classic dry California brush that ignites at the smallest spark. Less rainfall means reduced snowpack on mountaintops and lessened stream flow, causing intense dry seasons and only further priming our already-parched lands for fire. 
According to The New York Times, nine out of 10 of the largest fires in California history have occurred in the past 10 years, and nine out of 10 of the hottest years on record have happened since 2000. Most of California’s rain falls from October to April, and rising global temperatures and lower annual rainfall averages mean that vegetation is growing and drying out more quickly, providing perfect fuel for the flames. Fire season is no longer an open-and-closed chapter of the year. 
It’s key to remember that fires have always been an essential part of California’s ecology. Periodic wildfires can clear out dry and decaying vegetation, adding nutrients back into the soil. However, with the expansion of the human population and dwellings in these areas, natural fires are suppressed, and fuel for the fires is accumulated. Not only does this increase the likelihood of a blaze, but it also increases the damages and costs inflicted as more property burns. This issue was apparent in the 2018 Woolsey fire in Malibu, as the expensive homes built into the dry mountains overlooking the ocean essentially added to the kindling around it, causing many to lose their homes.
While California has some of the most ambitious and restrictive emissions policies in the country, these efforts are being undermined by the amount s of carbon dioxide and pollutants that waft into the atmosphere during a fire. The smoke, ash and bad air quality from these blazes have been spread by wind as far away as Northern Europe; the aerosols can even be detected by satellites from space. The Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality Index tracks the amounts of five major pollutants in the air — ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and airborne particles — and measures the overall quality of the air on a scale from 0 to 500, dividing the system into six levels based on the extremity of health concern. 
Opening up my air quality index app is a humbling experience. In L.A. County, it’s common for the AQI to reach a value between 101-150, or “unhealthy for sensitive groups,” but the number of 151-200 “unhealthy” values in the past few weeks due to the smoke in the air has been troubling. Pollution from aerosols (and smoke particulates!) not only aggravates conditions like asthma but can also cause burning eyes, runny noses, heart and lung disease — and this harmful pollution is spreading far beyond California, decreasing air quality around the world and compounding the respiratory effects of the coronavirus.
Allowing for more controlled burns in open areas and tree and brush trimming in critical zones is crucial, as is establishing greater accountability for essential gas and electric companies such as Pacific Gas & Electric, which averages responsibility for at least one fire a day in California. Gov. Gavin Newsom also recently signed Assembly Bill 2147, which allows inmates who work as incarcerated firefighters to have their criminal records expunged so that they can pursue firefighting after they have finished their sentences.
Reforming California’s land-use legislation to prevent construction in the highest-risk areas and creating stricter building codes are other relatively simple and non-intrusive ways of implementing substantive change. Effective codes and regulations to mitigate wildfires can’t be put into place without acknowledging the science of the situation. But with the rate at which the West Coast is burning, more extreme global measures must be taken. 
Apocalyptic orange skies, power shutoffs and air so choked with particulates that it’s hazardous to step outside your house seem fitting for 2020, but there is no reason for this to be the new normal. Forest fires are inevitable, and California’s climate and natural landscape provide the perfect kindling. However, the world, the U.S. and California alike are far from where they need to be in terms of emissions reductions and preventative climate change measures — and the effects of this reality are impossible to ignore. While it may be more complicated and arduous, federal policies must indeed adhere to scientific fact. 
While effective fire prevention and recovery are undoubtedly essential, the problem needs to be addressed at the source. Whether you’re an environmentalist or a climate change denier, there’s no ignoring that the increasing levels of physical destruction, adverse health effects and upheaval caused by California’s extensive wildfire season are simply one byproduct of a worldwide climate emergency that needs to be more aggressively addressed.

Metabolic circuits can drain the life out of you, but no amount of physical work will keep you void of energy and motivation like depression.
College and professional sports analysts rave on about how a sore hamstring or a shoulder injury might affect an athlete’s performance during a game. But mental health is often overlooked as something that can tangibly affect the performance of athletes.
Throughout my time playing sports, physical injuries have been manageable, by having a tolerance for pain and receiving care from athletic trainers. Now at the collegiate level and on, physical recovery and preventative athletic medicine consistently keep my body at the optimal level of health
Even with the abundance of fueling that USC offers to student-athletes like myself, somedays I just cannot find it in myself to perform. 
Being an athlete comes with a competitive mindset. I love competing in sports and casual games. However, with so much time off from volleyball now, I have been able to give my mind a break and take a step back. Because of this retreat, I have realized how unhealthy it is to constantly compare yourself to others and only equate your worth to sports. 
This idea of excessive self-evaluation was especially evident during our last season when we didn’t have a consistent starting lineup. Our lineup and positional standings were always changing, which led to some team members consistently analyzing how we stacked up against each other. In a way, this can be good because it incentivizes individuals to push themselves to make the team better as a whole. However, players are much more than just the sport they play, and these competitive thoughts linger on the mind.
According to research from Drexel and Kean universities, about 25% of collegiate athletes reported “clinically relevant” symptoms of depression. Considering college athletes demand perfection from their bodies for multiple hours a day on top of the expectation of perfection in their studies at rigorous universities, there remains little time for the mind to rest.
“The rest” for me has been of particular focus recently. “The rest” refers to the time spent for both the body and mind to recover but also the time needed for a student-athlete to be an individual. Both of these are equally important and deserve their own respective time within a student-athlete’s schedule. 
What the athlete needs most is time for personal interests and growth. An athlete should not be defined by their sport just as a worker should not be defined by their job. Both are individuals who desire personal fulfillment both within and outside their sport or career.
This is where I have been mentally the past few weeks. These past few months without constant practices have been the longest I have gone without an organized schedule of training in nearly a decade, which is honestly very hard to believe. 
In many ways, I am so grateful for this break from training. I am sad that it had to happen under these circumstances, but it has given me the opportunity to grow as a person like never before. The growth process was not always perfect by any means, but I am beyond grateful for this time to focus on personal interests. Whether it be art, film or music, I’ve had so much more time to explore topics that I’ve been longing to invest time into with the time that is deserved to kindle a passion.
Throughout this time off, I have come to see that sports were often the perfect mask for depression as I didn’t have the time or energy to realize what I was feeling. I thought I was having my ass kicked by sports and school when it was really being kicked by mental illness. This also came in hand with a hyper-masculine athletic environment where vulnerability is viewed as a weakness and a failure. 
My first two years at USC were filled with amazing memories and loads of success, but that success was only on the court and in the classroom, which left me wondering if that was it. Now with my own time to pursue other passions, I see how imperative it is to maintain good mental health and how easily a person can lose sight of it when your world is consumed by sports and school. 
I do not know when sports will return to the state they were in eight months ago, but I hope that every athlete realizes how important it is to make time for themselves in a tightly regimented schedule. At the end of the day, looking after your mental health will not only provide for growth as an individual, but also growth in your game.

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed the TroyPhi Resolution of Support during Tuesday night’s Senate meeting. The Senate also confirmed Jack Rasmussen as its newest senator and presented the organization’s reduced budget following cuts from the University.  
Written by USG Sens. Ruben Romeo and Alexis Areias with the help of Richelle Caday, the President of USC Troy Philippines, the resolution calls on USG and USC administrators to sign and endorse the Phillippine Human Rights Act — an American bill that calls on the U.S. government to suspend security assistance to the Philippines. The Act was written in response to the Anti-Terror Act, a broad-sweeping Pilipino law that criminalized public criticisms of the Pilipino Government as acts of terror.  
The resolution also calls on USG and the USC administration to “unequivocally stand with its Pilipinx students to promote their safety and inclusion.” 
Nearly 1,000 Pilipinx students attend USC and, due to the coronavirus pandemic, a portion of them are attending classes online from the Philippines. According to Romeo, USC’s Pilipinx American students have felt the Anti-Terror Act’s ramifications, and some students have family members who reside in the Philippines. 
“By putting the resolution through the Senate, this gets the administration to recognize that this is a problem that USG stands behind or that this is something that is important to the students,” Romeo said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “By creating that platform, student Pilipinx leaders [and] Pilipinx nationals can then help with the senators … talk with administration to really make sure that spaces on campus for USC students are safe and secure.”
In addition to passing the resolution, USG also swore in the newest member of its Senate, Jack Rasmussen, a junior majoring in business administration. Ramussen was sworn in by USG Associate Justice Ben Morain and joins the Senate with no previous USG experience. Rasmussen’s swearing in brings the Senate to full capacity following the resignations of former Vice President Rose Ritch and former Sen. Isabel Washington. Ritch was replaced by former Sen. Trinity Moore, which opened up one of the Senate vacancies. 
Rasmussen hopes that his background as a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon, a USC fraternity, will bring a diverse perspective to the Senate. 
“I think USG just in general is just not a very approachable organization,” Rasmussen said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “What I’ve found is that they don’t interact with the student body as well as they could and so I was thinking I offer a different viewpoint as someone who wouldn’t normally get involved in USG but wants to make a difference in diversity [and] mental health.”
Several senators provided updates on their goals and projects at the meeting. Among them was Sen. Lennon Wesley III, a junior majoring in business administration and philosophy, politics and law. Wesley said he is attempting to work with members of the USC administration, such as Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp, to advance the interests of the University’s marginalized and low-income students. 
“A lot of the problems that are going on right now — whether that be [the coronavirus], California wildfires, social unrest — a lot of those things disproportionately affect lower income and minority students,” Wesley said in an interview with the Daily Trojan about his Minority and Low-Income Students Resolution. “It’s easy to forget about minority students and lower-income students because generally they’re the most underrepresented group amongst whatever population you take. All students are important, all students matter and their needs are important, but sometimes I feel it’s necessary to specifically address the needs of student populations that aren’t getting as much care and need more support than usual.”
President Gabe Savage also discussed the USG Fall 2020 Budget Proposal near the meeting’s end. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Savage said USG’s funds were decreased by nearly 90% due to budget cuts from the University to reduce student fees. However, with the carry-over of funds from the previous academic year, the organization is experiencing a depletion of funds of around 77%. With mandatory allocations, including student stipends and staff salaries, USG in total has $363,600 total funds. 
According to Savage, USC issued a decrease in the $64 mandatory student fee issued each year to undergraduates enrolled at the University that is used for student programming. This year, only $13 from each student’s fee will be distributed to USG from the University’s new “Student Services” fee of $100. 
The budget cuts come after the University raised tuition for the 2020-21 academic year by 3.5% with tuition now totaling $59,260.

What’s Kaash Paige’s secret to landing a record deal with Def Jam, blowing up on TikTok and working with Travis Scott, all before turning 20?
“I feel like if you just stay down and keep putting your work in, just manifesting and putting out that good energy and believing it too, I feel like anything can happen,” Paige said.
The Dallas native — whose debut album “Teenage Fever” featured such rap stars as Don Toliver, 42 Dugg and Isaiah Rashad — hosted a virtual press conference  Sept. 28 to discuss everything from her creative process to the origin of her stage name, which stands for “kill all arrogance, stop hatred.”
“You ever been around so many different opinions, you start to question how you should look, or how you should dress, or just in general how you should even think?” Paige said. “When I came up with that saying, I was just surrounded by so much arrogance, and I wanted to change how I thought about myself. ,” Paige said. “I used to hate myself cause I couldn’t be like these people. I couldn’t be a leader, I was always a follower.”
While her route to success is certainly not traditional, it’s becoming a feasible option for more artists by the day. Her track “Love Songs,” which interpolates Chance the Rapper’s “Cocoa Butter Kisses,” was used in millions of TikTok videos, attracting the attention of an A&R representative at Def Jam who offered her a record deal.
“When I first found out that my song was trending on TikTok, I was at Prairie View [A&M University’s] homecoming … Somebody went up to me like ‘Yo, yo, yo, you’re trending on Apple Music,’” Paige said. “Knowing that people can dance to a song that I never would have thought you could dance to is just insane. I just appreciate those influencers and kids and everybody for getting on there and doing that.”
Paige’s parents didn’t initially have the same goals for her that she had for herself. While they supported her pursuing her musical aspirations, they wanted her to attend college while doing so.
“Your parents have this one goal for you and it’s like they have your whole life planned out. It was like, that’s dope but that’s not what I want to do,” Paige said. “I was like ‘Nah, something’s finna happen. I don’t know what it is, but my life finna change.’”
In addition to celebrating milestone accomplishments, she believes it’s important to appreciate steps taken in the process of achieving them.
“Any accomplishment that you’re tryna achieve — you know, any dream, any desire — and it happens for you, that’s success to me, if it’s little or big,” Paige said. “I feel like we focus on success being ‘I need to be the biggest artist in the world.’ That’s success, but this song that you just recorded right now, that’s success too.”
Paige takes pride in her bisexuality, often making reference to relationships with both women and men in her songs. She encouraged other aspiring musicians to be proud of their identities and be their authentic selves.
“In this industry you can do anything, you can be anything you want,” Paige said.
True to her neck tattoo reading “Overthinking Kills,” Paige’s songwriting process is very organic. She plays beats for her friends, asks how each one makes them feel, then improvises lyrics that evoke their suggested emotions.
“Every single song that’s on ‘Teenage Fever,’ every single song that’s on ‘Parked Car Convos,’ I freestyled that,” Paige said.
Although she recently linked up with Future and has gone clubbing in Atlanta with fellow young rappers Mulatto and Flo Milli, she chooses to take an optimistic view of her experience quarantining earlier this year. As someone who prefers spending quality time with her loved ones, she relished the opportunity to grow closer to her family and friends. Reducing distractions also helped her hone in on her craft and make more music.
“What else can you do besides brainstorm and plot?” Paige said.
In terms of her long-term aspirations, Paige wants to continue to grow and support the music scene in Dallas. She wants to own a studio, record label and music festival in her hometown where artists can showcase the stylistic diversity that their city has to offer. As a model for success, she looks to Texas superstar Travis Scott, with whom she co-featured on Don Toliver’s song “Euphoria” earlier this year.
“You know how Travis Scott has Astroworld [Festival]?” Paige said. “I wanna do something in Dallas a little bit kinda like that but at the State Fair Park and really turn it up.”,” Paige said.
With her keen understanding that just one song has the power to change an artist’s entire career trajectory, she advises aspiring artists not to limit their ambitions.
“Nothing’s unrealistic in this world,” Paige said. “Speak literally, whatever the fuck you want. ‘I want this, I’m gonna be a billionaire.’ That’s gonna happen for you.”
Her album “Teenage Fever” is available now on all streaming platforms.

Staff, faculty and students from the USC Pullias Center for Higher Education, a research institute housed within the Rossier School of Education, convened for a Zoom call in July. Unlike the typical mid-pandemic virtual happy hours and cups of coffee, this meeting was more than just another last-ditch attempt at socialization.
About a month after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police — followed by nationwide and ongoing protests, growing support for the Black Lives Matter movement and a widespread public demand for institutional accountability — the meeting had one objective: to call the Center to action.
The goal of the Zoom call, Zoë Corwin, a research associate professor at the Pullias Center, recalled, was simple — to mobilize resources and faculty expertise at the center to help advance the conversation around racial inequity in the United States.
“We came together as a center to say ‘Alright we’re all working on different things,’” Corwin said, “‘But how can we take our expertise and share it in ways that we feel will be helpful for the greater society?’” 
During the meeting, Jordan Harper, a doctoral student at Rossier and a research assistant at the Pullias Center, proposed an idea: Higher Ed Conversations In Black. Inspired by Ed Gordon’s book, “Conversations in Black: On Power, Politics, and Leadership,” Harper envisioned a bimonthly publication that offered a space for Black educators to share stories and ideas around problems of racial inequity in higher education. The series would be posted to the Pullias Center’s webpage in a blog-style format.
“The initial plan was to actually create a guide around racial equity more broadly for administrators, faculty, staff, students,” Harper said. “[We] realized time was of the essence, so if we wanted to do something we would have to move very fast.” 
Three months later, Harper’s idea became a reality. With the support of the Pullias Center, Harper and Corwin released their first issue “Good and Necessary Trouble” in early September. 
The publication invited a handful of prominent Black USC educators, including Rossier Dean Pedro Noguera and professor of education John Slaughter, to answer questions about the online school year, the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing instances of police brutality in the U.S. Many of the contributors urged readers to take up the “good and necessary trouble” of staying vigilant in their fight against “anti-Blackness and white supremacy” as they headed into the new school year.
“It is exciting that all the projects were brainstormed and visioned by students, postdocs and faculty in our center,” wrote Adrianna Kezar, director of the Pullias Center, in an email statement to the Daily Trojan. “We hoped to help frame discussions about key issues in higher education and foreground the views of Black scholars and leaders that are sometimes overlooked.”
The goal of the publication, according to the Pullias Center website, is to “curate questions around higher education issues” for Black scholars that will be answered in each edition. Invited contributors will offer 100-200 word responses that will be uploaded in a discussion-style format. Harper and his team at Pullias hope to use this question-and-answer structure to highlight the often-overlooked voices of Black scholars as they address key issues of inequity and inaccessibility in American higher education. 
With their first issue completed, the Center looks to continue the series on a bimonthly basis, with the next issue set to be released in November. 
For Harper and Corwin, the current state of the pandemic and online learning presents a new set of equity problems for higher-ed institutions. Students, who once enjoyed access to the same libraries, workspaces, tutoring centers and living facilities, are now stuck at home with varying levels of access to academic resources and safe work environments. 
“I think that we are all going through a lot of stress related to COVID right now,” Corwin said, “and I think Black students have a whole other deep level of stress and trauma that they have undergone this summer … [Zoom] is a very intimate space, and that’s exhausting.”
In upcoming editions, Harper and Corwin look to address Zoom-related equity issues. Harper cites the over-policing of Black and brown students as an example of a new and important issue facing higher education today.
“One way I see this policing manifesting is the requirement to have cameras on in Zoom,” Harper said. “Some people don’t want [others] to know what their background looks like.”
Harper and Corwin plan to also invite Black thought leaders to discuss issues surrounding the soon approaching 2020 presidential election and highlight the experiences of Black graduate and doctoral students at USC and elsewhere.
“What’s exciting about this project is that … higher ed is constantly changing,” Harper said. “There’s always something new to discuss. It’s kind of challenging, but it’s kind of exciting to just go with the flow.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Zoë Corwin’s first name as Zoe and misstated Corwin’s role at the USC Pullias Center for Higher Education as staff when she is a research associate professor. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

When state and local governments instituted lockdowns in March, thousands of students in Los Angeles County faced an unprecedented level of uncertainty. For USC’s Joint Educational Project, this meant temporarily halting student tutor programs.  
Before the pandemic, JEP tutors would teach science, literature and a multitude of other subjects to neighboring K-12 schools. The tutors served as an additional support to assist teachers in the classroom. 
“When everything went virtual in March, we ended the [after school] program,” said Susan Harris, executive director of JEP. “The University was telling us that we couldn’t send students anywhere, and then [Los Angeles Unified School District] shut down as well.”
During this hiatus, JEP worked with other programs at USC to develop a system to help partnering schools, students and teachers adjust to the virtual learning environment. Over the summer and alongside the Keck School of Medicine’s “Care for the Caregiver” program, JEP’s student tutors provided tutoring services to the children of coronavirus health care providers. 
“It was completely crazy,” Harris said. “All of these teachers were expected to just over night figure out how to teach online and the schools were not set up in the best way for that.”
Making pre-recorded videos that students, parents and teachers could access at any time proved to be the most suitable course of action. The tutors are now recording short videos on specific sub-topics that are then shared with teachers and can be played any time during and after class.
Dieuwertje Kast, director of JEP’s STEM education programs, said they had changed their curriculum to reflect the home setting and tried to make it accessible to the different students at the schools JEP serves. 
“We work primarily with Title One or low- income students,” Kast said. “And so we know that accessibility to some of these supplies is difficult.”
Engaging students virtually has continued to be a challenge for JEP and its partnering schools. Nelly Cristales, a second-grade teacher at 32nd Street USC Performing Arts Magnet school, said that internet connectivity issues coupled with the distractions that students experience in their homes have presented their own challenges to schooling. Cristales has employed pictures, assigned drawing activities and used the visual arts as mediums to keep her students focused.
 “They get frustrated because they’re logged out three, four times a day. They’re lagging, I lag,” Cristales said. “They’re pulling hairs and strings like I am on my side, but I always try and be a reflection. I don’t hide that I’m frustrated. But I tell them, because I call them the Trojan scholars, we fight on.” 
Many of the areas where Cristales’ students reside often don’t have stable internet connection, and many have to travel to other places to take classes. Though L.A. County has provided students with computers and internet access, broadband issues persist in many of these communities. 
Cristales said that while some technical issues will always exist in a virtual setting, she has revised her curriculum and availed JEP as a support system to increase engagement and as a workaround for unstable internet connections. Cristales said that individually reaching out to students’ families to ensure they have the right resources has been an effective tool to ensure participation in the virtual space.
“JEP comes in and gives that extra support, outside school hours where this child is more relaxed … so it’s a blessing,” Cristales said. “Through JEP we’re getting many courses live, which is supporting our instruction. Now any parent can access it at their own time and so they have access to a one-on-one.” 
Brooke McMahon, a graduate student at the Rossier School of Education, said the new learning domain has made her teaching style more creative. Last week, utilizing makeshift blocks of steak, McMahon taught her students a lesson on pathology. A virtual field trip to McMahon’s mother’s pathology lab further provided a platform for her students to learn more about the subject. 
“I think it’s great for myself and for my other two teachers just to see what kids are getting and what they need and how we can be better teachers to engage people,” McMahon said. 
For Kast, bite-sized activities like the ones organized by McMahon mirror the in-person learning exercises that students typically participate in within a classroom. 
“We’re doing our best to try and emulate as much of our in-person program as we can in the virtual space,” Kast said. 
The coronavirus has laid bare the intrinsic inequities prevalent in the educational framework of communities where JEP’s students serve. As JEP’s executive director, Harris has tried to instill a sense of responsibility within student tutors to faithfully serve their communities and recognize deeply rooted systems of inequality.
“[We have] really shifted our curriculum to think a lot more about some of the bigger issues that are happening related to the pandemic,” Harris said, “Black Lives Matter and some of the issues surrounding inequality and how it disproportionately affects kids of color in the community that we serve.”

After spending hours standing, sifting and sorting through endless racks of garments, there is no better feeling than finding that perfectly worn pair of “vintage” jeans or a faded oversized T-shirt from an iconic band. Especially when working around a budget, that feeling only intensifies when a brief glance at the price tag reveals this thrifted find is only five bucks! Shopping on a budget is essential for many college students who turn to second-hand thrift and consignment stores as a budget-friendly and sustainable alternative to fast-fashion shopping. 
Yet, amid the pandemic, many virtual students (especially those who are immunocompromised) are wary of returning to in-person thrift shopping so soon. The coronavirus is not the only thing keeping buyers from thrifting in person. It often takes at least a few hours to have a successful trip to the thrift store; it takes time to drive there (and park — if one is in Los Angeles), go through all of the clothes, try everything on and get back home. Such a process can make in-person thrifting inaccessible to those with limited free time and mobility. 
Enter virtual thrifting! Online resale platforms such as Depop, thredUP and Poshmark make thrifting much more convenient and accessible to those who aren’t able to frequent the physical storefronts. Additionally, it’s a great option for those who want to shop sustainably, since it does not directly contribute to the fast-fashion industry (notorious for its negative environmental impacts) while also reducing the amount of clothing that ends up in landfills. Oftentimes, if a buyer wants to shop sustainably, they are met with brands like Reformation and Everlane that are extremely expensive and not as inclusive in their sizing options. 
ThredUP has even put out an annual Fashion Resale Report since 2017 that highlights the success of its business model, the growth of the online resale and secondhand industry and, in recent years, the positive impacts of its sustainability efforts.
Unfortunately, these apps are still far from perfect. Critics are worried that the increase in prices at chain thrift stores like Goodwill are due to the rise in popularity of such clothing-resale platforms. Oftentimes, the prices on resale platforms are higher than what one would see at a thrift store but lower than if purchased new. These prices usually account for the seller’s time spent tediously sifting through mass amounts of clothing, setting up their online shop’s presence, the fees that the platforms take from every sale and shipping the physical product to the buyer. 
Even given this fact, though, it is still worrisome to see thrifted items going for exorbitant prices, sometimes even exceeding the $100 mark. While there are still plenty of listed options that are affordable and fairly priced, there is a growing concern that prices will continue to skyrocket on these platforms and price out those who utilize these apps as an affordable and accessible alternative to fast fashion and storefront thrift shopping.  
The current market for sustainable and ethical fashion is yielding prices that are significantly higher than fast fashion alternatives. Coupled with current trends in the thrift and resale market, affordable and sustainable shopping is at great risk of becoming inaccessible to low-income buyers. 
To curb the growth of the fast fashion industry and promote sustainability, it is extremely important to ensure that reselling platforms remain accessible to buyers of all income brackets. Popular resale apps need to protect their low-income buyers and marketing accessibility as much as they do sustainability.
