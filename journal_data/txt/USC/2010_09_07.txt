An exhilarating atmosphere filled Bovard Auditorium on Monday night when six a cappella groups took  the stage, captivating and enthralling a rapt audience for two hours.
This year, the All Hail A Cappella concert was hosted by the Troy Tones, who performed alongside other notable campus a cappella groups such as the USC Sirens, SoCal Vocals, The Trojan Men, Reverse Osmosis and Khoir Practice.
The concert was organized in an effort to showcase the very best of USC’s aural talent. By flaunting their unique characteristics, these six groups also hoped to attract raw talent for the new academic year.
Thompson Aplin and Brad Wergley from USC’s improv troop  Commedus Interruptus served as the emcees for the evening. Aplin and Wergley succeeded in getting the audience pumped for the night of music ahead via entertaining, albeit unrelated, chants of “Panda Express.”
The first group to perform was Reverse Osmosis. With five albums under the group’s belt, its opening act did not disappoint. Beginning with an enthusiastic rendition of “Carry On My Wayward Son” by Kansas, the group was clad in black costumes accented by blue trim. It easily transitioned into its second, more demure number: “I See You” by Leona Lewis, the theme to Avatar.
The grand finale for Reverse Osmosis was a mash-up of “Disturbia” by Rihanna, “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” by the Eurythmics, “Unbreak My Heart” by Toni Braxton, “Crazy” by Britney Spears and the crowd favorite, “Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely” by the Backstreet Boys. The number was accompanied by Lady Gaga-inspired twitching and the victory sign woven into the choreography.
The ladies of the USC Sirens were next, starting with a soothing version of “Yesterday” by the Beatles. This was followed up by the empowering “Running Away” by Paul Haig and a dulcet finish with “What Can I Do?” by the Corrs.
The suited-up Trojan Men, looking to get the audience excited about the football season, began by ceremoniously stabbing the stage in the traditional Tommy Trojan fashion. Their opening number was a school-spirited mash-up of USC’s “Fight On” and “All Hail,” the university’s alma mater, which garnered much approval from the audience. A soulful version of Jon Laughlin’s “Human” was next, followed by an energetic performance of “Yes We Can Can” by the Pointer Sisters.
A stirring interpretation of “Torn” by Natalie Imbruglia served as the introduction to the fun-loving Khoir Practice.  The group incorporated some rather raunchy hip thrusts into its second song of “Afternoon Delight” by Starland Vocal Band before transitioning into a passionate performance of “Africa” by Toto to close the set.
The heavyweights of a cappella, the SoCal VoCals, followed. With two International Championship Collegiate A Cappella titles — and won as recently as April — the group took the stage dressed in black with Trojan-themed ties for the men. An animated performance of DJ Earworm’s “Summer Mash-up” borrowed signature phrases from a plethora of artists to make an entertaining first number.
The group continued with its haunting award-winning solo, “God Bless the Child” by Billie Holiday, which featured member Emily Goglia as the main voice. The VoCals also displayed their skills with their last song, a remix of “Tusk” by Fleetwood Mac and the USC alma mater.
The Troy Tones concluded the evening, delighting the audience by appearing onstage in outfits inspired by the cast of MTV’s Jersey Shore. They donned tight skirts, fluorescent tank tops and Snooki bumps while taking swigs from a vodka bottle and toting a sign that read “Will strip for shots.” The crew started with a fist-pumping version of “We Built This City” by Jefferson Starship, followed by “Cowboy Casanova” by Carrie Underwood and “Downfall” by Matchbox Twenty.
All in all, at the end of the night, the groups proved that it doesn’t take an instrument to make music.
The Sirens’ “Running Away” was not by Paul Haig, I’m pretty sure. I think it was a Midnight Hour song.

From the early days of film to the most reckless days of punk, Los Angeles has always been a hub for creative innovation.
Our historical distance from European thought and our physical distance from older cities like New York has allowed Los Angeles to be used as a petri dish for all kinds of experimentation. The lure of scholastic freedom in a location with a constantly evolving identity has brought artists from around the world to play in our sunny year-round laboratory.
Though the results are not presentable in movie theaters, concert venues or white-walled galleries, Southern California is nonetheless the birthplace of the most prolific artistic movements of the 20th century: architectural modernism.
It might be missing from an L.A. tour of the high-modern houses from prominent architects such as Richard Neutra, Ray Eames or John Lautner, but the house that first brought minimalism into the domestic realm is still standing behind an ivy-laden fence just south of West Hollywood’s bustling main street.
Rudolph Schindler’s private residence on Kings Road — constructed from 1921-1922 — is believed to be the first house built in the straightforward modern style. Soon after its construction, Los Angeles’ foothill communities became testing grounds for Schindler’s contemporaries and other forward-thinking architects who brought prominence to his approach.
When the Industrial Revolution introduced steel and glass into the world of commercial production, the old ideas of structural form dissolved. Formerly confined by the limits of bricklaying and masonry, the new materials opened the blueprints to exploratory ideas of domestic living and brought art and design to the forefront of what was once a science-, math- and logic-dominated field.
What followed were turn-of-the-century architectural movements such as Craftsman and Art Nouveau, which focused on built-in decorative accents, putting houses by architects such as Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright on the map.
It was while Schindler was in town supervising the construction of one of these houses — the Hollyhock House, Wright’s first in Los Angeles — that the Austrian-born architect became inspired by the city’s then-rural landscape and built his own home nearby.
Set against a neighborhood that, at the time, was filling up with Spanish revival homes, Schindler’s communal live/work space designed for two families broke all convention in both concept and design.
By scaling back the organic ornamentation found in Wright’s houses of that period, Schindler was able to focus on functionality. The minimalist, open-floor plan that he implemented has since influenced an entire generation of Southern California architects.
The Schindler House — as it is internationally known — is most notable, however, for its seamless integration of indoor and outdoor space with multipurpose utility rooms that open up into the lush backyard, and bedrooms that are actually open-air, canopied spaces on the roof.
Today, the Schindler House remains a bastion of early modern architecture, uninhabited since Schindler’s wife Pauline died in 1977. Unlike other early-modern examples that dot the city’s sprawl — many of which are inhabited and can only be viewed in coffee-table books on the subject — it is open to the public as a mini-museum that is partly a homage and partly a center for avant-garde thought.
Through the Pauline Schindler-established advocacy group Friends of the Schindler House, the residence has undergone a complete renovation; since 1994, it has also served as the base for the Los Angeles satellite of Vienna, Austria’s Museum for Applied Arts/Contemporary Art.
L.A.’s MAK Center for Art and Architecture offers a healthy repertoire of fellowships, programming and exhibitions entirely structured around Schindler’s contributions to the two fields. Seeing the historical significance for both Los Angeles and Schindler’s homeland, the Austrian government invested in the center through both its upkeep of the Schindler House and its purchase of other local Schindler-designed residences.
Currently, MAK operates two other Schindler structures — the Pearl M. Mackey Apartments on Cochran Avenue in the Miracle Mile and the Fitzpatrick-Leland house atop Mulholland Drive in Lauren Canyon.
The Mackey Apartments are home to the center’s scholarship program, which since 1995 has offered six-month residencies to young artists and architects who work with the interdisciplinary possibilities of the two fields. Each is given a renovated apartment in the now five-unit complex and a monthly stipend to conduct their work. At the end of each stay — in March and September — the residents, many of whom have never been to Los Angeles before, present their work at an exhibition inside the Schindler House.
The Fitzpatrick-Leland house hosts MAK’s Urban Future Initiative, which centers on a biannual fellowship program reserved for cultural thinkers who are envisioning new and different urban spaces.
Thanks to the Republic of Austria’s L.A.-centric preservation and programming efforts, all three of the MAK Center’s Schindler residences continue to contribute to the academic disciplines that birthed them.
Unlike other local homes built in the modern style — many of which are private residences, unprotected from renovation or demolition — Schindler’s main designs are being preserved by governments and institutions that are making them culturally active again.
So while the owner of Lautner’s Shusett house recently got demolition approval from the city of Beverly Hills (no doubt to build another Spanish revival villa), the Schindler House continues to invite art and architecture fans into its uniquely expansive space for daytime tours, art exhibitions and stimulating interdisciplinary thought.

Can a romantic comedy work if the two leading players spend most of the movie in separate places? Going the Distance proves that it can — with a little effort and the right two people. The romance itself, though, is a different story.
Lovebirds · Going the Distance is Geoff LaTulippe’s first screenplay, and features a star-studded cast with an ensemble of familiar faces. - Photo courtesy of Warner Brothers  
Drew Barrymore and Justin Long star as Erin and Garrett, two early 30-somethings in a cross-country relationship. Garrett is a New Yorker with commitment problems, and Erin, a graduate student from San Francisco with an unpaid internship, is only in New York for the summer. They share a somewhat unoriginal first meeting over an arcade game at a bar (although Erin’s high score on the video game tells us she’s not like the proverbial “other girls”), and begin what is meant to be six weeks of purely casual dating before Erin returns to California.
But, as we see in the charming — if somewhat cliché — montage of their time together, Erin and Garrett start to fall for each other; when the time comes to say goodbye, they can’t do it. They decide to try the long-distance thing and the film shows us the ups and downs of that risky endeavor, from expensive flights to surprise visits and awkward attempts at phone sex. But as more serious issues arise, Erin and Garrett must ultimately choose between love and career.
One of the movie’s greatest assets is its cultural relevance, which it maintains without throwing its “trendiness” in your face. Going the Distance confronts the new economic reality of life in a recession. Like Erin, college grads of all ages are taking unpaid internships while companies lay off their paid employees. With today’s dearth of jobs, is it really realistic to choose love over financial security?
Ten years ago, a rom-com couple like this one — Erin is an aspiring journalist and Garrett, who works for a record label — would have been the picture of young success, but today both professions are threatened by the Internet, and Erin and Garrett must deal with the challenges faced by their respective industries. Fortunately, the movie doesn’t use the economic downturn as a gimmicky plot device. It is simply the reality that Erin and Garrett, like the rest of us, must face, making the difficulties of their romance resonate that much more.
Real-life on-again, off-again couple Barrymore and Long are both unceasingly likable and charming enough to make you care, even when the story doesn’t provide much in terms of a believable relationship. They come off not as big movie stars who know exactly how good-looking they are, but as real people.
Barrymore and Long capture perfectly the multitude of awkward moments that can occur early in a relationship, but we also see how genuinely happy they make each other; Barrymore’s sparkling smile and Long’s boyish grin always feel natural.
Long and Barrymore essentially play feed men to the ridiculous ensemble cast that surrounds them. Christina Applegate and comedian Jim Gaffigan get laughs as Erin’s intense, neat-freak sister and deadbeat brother-in-law. Jason Sudeikis of Saturday Night Live and Charlie Day of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia play Garrett’s crude-but-loyal best friends. Sudeikis excels at the sex jokes and genital humor, but his dimensionless macho attitude sometimes crosses the line into just plain annoying.
Day essentially plays the same simple-minded character that he does so well on It’s Always Sunny, and fortunately, his odd brand of humor translates perfectly on the big screen. The absolute sincerity of Day’s delivery, whether giving relationship advice while using the bathroom with the door open or giving an impassioned speech on masturbation at a crowded intersection, makes him both likable and hysterically funny.
At times, however, screenwriter Geoff LaTulippe relies too much on the supposedly intrinsic humor of phallic jokes and not enough on genuinely clever writing. The film could easily have done without some of the more explicit (and less funny) dialogue while still maintaining its humor and heart.
Going the Distance doesn’t provide anything revolutionary in the way of romantic comedies, but the concept is original enough and the actors charming enough to make it enjoyable. Although long-distance relationships in today’s economy might be difficult, at least they can be funny.

Witnessing the great character actor Danny Trejo in a leading role is worth enduring the blood-soaked mayhem of Robert Rodriguez’s politically charged carnival ride, Machete. For the past two decades of Hollywood filmmaking, the actor’s chapped, leathery mug has lurked behind every bar counter and amid every heist team. With the occasional growl or mutter slipping out like a wisp of gunsmoke, Machete arrives with an air of prophecy.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
Rodriguez’s picture also arrives just in time to give Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer a few more white hairs and similarly ruffle proponents of Arizona’s new immigration law.
An adaptation of the director’s own fake trailer from splatter-throwback Grindhouse — by far the most incendiary thing to be found within those three hours of manufactured schlock — Machete begins with a botched raid at the desert lair of drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal, in his best role to date). The driver, an ex-federale known as Machete (Trejo), ignores his whining partner and rams the compound with their police cruiser (the whining partner is thus riddled with bullets). The ill-fated hit ends with many severed body parts and the tragic murder of the title character’s wife, courtesy of Torrez.
Three years later and north of the border without a green card, the newly homeless Machete gets by on day labor. He is propositioned by a slippery senatorial aide (Jeff Fahey) to assassinate Sen. John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), a Texan xenophobe who shoots illegal immigrants for sport when the cameras aren’t rolling. Of course, the assassination attempt is a stunt orchestrated by McLaughlin to gain votes. This is how Rodriguez ensures the title hero a full hour’s worth of ludicrously violent revenge that would leave directors Russ Meyer and John Waters flushed with elation. Welcome to the resurrected world of Mexploitation cinema.
In some ways, the director’s attempts to channel 1970s trash cinema has always been a doomed dream, if an endearing one. A scantily clad Pam Grier blowing apart a drug baron’s head like a watermelon might have been countercultural during the Jimmy Carter years. However, anyone who witnessed Alejandre Aja’s recent flesh-fest, Piranha 3-D, would be hard pressed to argue that a severed penis and innumerable flapping bosoms belonged in a 42nd Street theater and not at the Beverly Center multiplex.
Still, what Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino failed to achieve with two features, Rodriguez finally accomplishes here, with verve and alacrity. The superficial traditions remain intact: Machete jumps from Washington, D.C. to El Paso, Texas with no explanation of how he got there. At another point, the character wakes up, rips a life support tube from his chest and snatches his weapon upon news that henchmen are coming, leading to the film’s best sight gag: Machete escaping out the back window using a bad guy’s intestines.
The tasteless jokes work this time because they toy with popular expectations. Photographing excess is easy, but catching an audience off guard with its presentation remains a challenge. What better moves are there than to cast De Niro as the corrupt senator, Cheech Marin as a shotgun-wielding priest who aids Machete or Don Johnson as a border vigilante that dreams of seeing Trejo “dance the Bolero at the end of a rope?”
Indeed, everything about Machete, from its violence to its cast, seems borrowed from the imagination of a 15-year-old boy, and therefore, its realization is a wonder to behold. The only apparent compromise between this nostalgic origin and the box office is the presence of Jessica Alba as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. And yet, Rodriguez redeems her character with a speech so lame and applause so disproportionately thunderous that we are inclined to overlook the misstep in the interest of an uproarious laugh.
Although on paper there is much in Machete to be upset about, it is difficult to imagine being truly offended by what sights and sounds Rodriguez has to offer, given the movie’s overwhelmingly earnest nature.
There is not an ounce of mean-spirited energy to found in the film. Although its detractors, especially those who support deportations, will argue that the film enables racism against white Americans (a claim that should be taken with a grain of salt and a shot of Patrón), the merriment of watching Rodriguez’s dream brought to life by his band of actors renders Machete the most unabashedly enjoyable film of the year and a perfect finale for the summer.

Did you hear about Reggie Bush?
(Again?)
On Tuesday morning, Yahoo! Sports reported that Bush would be stripped of his 2005 Heisman Trophy, in light of an independent investigation that found the former Trojan running back ineligible during part of his time at USC.  Citing anonymous sources close the situation, the story estimated that the Heisman Trophy Trust would announce its decision by the end of September.
Later that afternoon, there was indeed an announcement from the Trust.  However, the official comment was contradictory to the Yahoo! story:
“The status of the USC/Bush matter remains unchanged. Any reports to the contrary are inaccurate.”
And so the saga of Reggie Bush’s Heisman lives on.
Although there’s no timeline for the official ruling on the matter, the facts of the case are readily available for judgment from the court of higher opinion.
Bush maintains his innocence, while the NCAA has ruled otherwise.
Although the resounding majority seems to favor the repossession of the trophy, there are some arguments that make an interesting case on Bush’s behalf.
We want to know:
Should Reggie Bush lose his Heisman Trophy?

What do you think? Add your two cents to the conversation by submitting a comment in the entry form below.
I think Austin said it all but wanted to chime in on Becky’s comment about money. When the education is completely free, I see no reason why a student athlete shouldn’t take student loans like everyone else. They’ll take far fewer so they’ll have far less to pay back. And let’s not forget, their education is supposed to be their pay.
Everyone seems to agree Bush’s performance warranted the Heisman. Whether his behavior should be punished retroactively is up for debate, but what might be more important is the broader picture. What can the NCAA do to change the culture of under-the-table kickbacks that is so pervasive in college sports? @Becky offers one solution, which is paying college athletes. While definitely a dangerous proposition, transparency may be just what college sport needs. If players are being paid (illegally already), why not make it official?
@Austin: “Regardless of benefits that he may have received he was still no doubt that he was the most outstanding player.”
That sums it up right there.

Personally I think he should keep the Heisman. The NCAA is a filthy hypocrite. They continually punish and sanction schools in an effort to have them watch themselves better. But if they continue to allow student athletes to compete while ineligible, or allow a coach to continue coaching at another location without sanctions against them personally, then the system is completely broken. The NCAA screwed up by allowing him to play. USC could have checked themselves better, but ultimately the NCAA was responsible for verifying that he was following rules. Ruling him ineligible years later is a load of crap. Bush keeps the Heisman.
I agree with Austin.  There’s no doubt that Reggie Bush was the most outstanding college football player that season.  The benefits were not responsible for making that the case.  Retroactively taking the award away won’t make amends for the improper benefits received.  The NCAA has already sanctioned USC in an attempt to do so.  If Bush is stripped of the Heisman it will be only on a technicality… most will still consider him the real Heisman Award winner.
I think the real issue here is the fact that this situation happens in the vast majority of athletic programs. These athletes get a full ride scholarship but don’t have the money for basic spending cash. They devote their lives to a school and program for four years with no time for a job. Why not just pay college athletes? They bring enough money into the school, it seems only fair that they see a little bit of that.
While Reggie Bush was found to have received improper benefits at least one factor should still be considered when considering stripping him of the award.  The Heisman Trophy is awarded to the most outstanding player in college football in a particular season.  Regardless of benefits that he may have received he was still no doubt that he was the most outstanding player.  Never has another player in history received a higher point total in Heisman voting.  
Don’t get me wrong, I find the fact that he and whomever else was involved in these actions deplorable, but he is without a doubt one of the most outstanding college football players of all time.

Today, President Barack Obama is speaking at the Western Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, where he is expected to unveil a series of proposals designed to kick-start economic growth. Among them is this request to Congress: that it permanently extend a $100-billion research and development tax credit and a $50-billion infrastructure push that would create temporary employment and rebuild roads, airstrips and railways.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Proposals like Obama’s are exactly the right type of government intervention in the current economy and are reminiscent of common policies in high-growth environments such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. Unfortunately, it seems the White House has caught on too late — it has only three more months to pass such legislation.
Republicans are expected to make massive gains in November’s midterm elections, after which they will likely block many Democratic initiatives. Republican leaders have been campaigning on the Democrats’ mishandling of the economy, but have been generally mute on what exact steps should be taken. Instead of taking a proactive approach, they will likely use their new strength in Congress to thwart governmental action in the economy to increase the Republican presidential candidate’s chances in 2012.
This obstructionist stance is in no way limited to Republicans. Instead, it is a structural characteristic of the opposition in American politics. Democrats behaved in a similar manner throughout the George W. Bush years and reaped the rewards in 2008. It is hypocritical of them to lament that Republicans might capitalize with the same tactic.
This is a permanent flaw in the American political system. Congress is powerful enough to block the executive’s agenda at will, and the constant campaigning that representatives must undertake because of biannual elections leads them to use that power to negative ends. Although solid policymaking requires a certain distance from the helter-skelter world of the 24-hour news cycle, legislators are forced to become populist screamers if they are to have a legitimate chance at job security.
In his book, From Wealth to Power, Fareed Zakaria (editor-at-large of Time magazine) used a case study of the United States from 1865 to 1908 to demonstrate the importance of executive supremacy over the legislature in a country’s ability to project power internationally. This was because of Congress’ reluctance to approve spending that would be unlikely to increase incumbents’ chances of re-election.
In the age of CNN, Rush Limbaugh and the blogosphere, the types of legislation that can pass Congress are restricted even further. Therefore, executive supremacy is not only a key to a state’s foreign policy power, but also its ability to effect economic and social change.
At the same time, the increasing ability of individual and particularly extreme fringe voices to influence the political environment seems to have created a shift away from executive supremacy. The increasing difficulty to pass legislation has made U.S. policy overly complicated and ineffective.
An example of this phenomenon can be seen in the health care bill passed earlier this year. That bill was 2,409 pages. The Social Security Act of 1935 was 64. The Constitution was four.
The bill ran as long as it did because as the administration tried to win over Congress, each compromise required more concessions. Unfortunately, though providing insurance to every American was an impressive achievement, the complications brought on by any 2,409-page piece of legislation are likely to overwhelm the benefits. Health care needed to be extended and simplified. Unfortunately, congressional obstructionism mandated that Obama choose one or the other.
This type of debacle can be contrasted with states that have strong executives. China is, of course, one example of this. The communist party’s grip on power has allowed decision-making to proceed extremely smoothly there for the past 20 years, facilitating astonishing growth rates. Clearly, China also demonstrates the flipside of the American dilemma — too much executive power leads to repression, a lack of human rights, and a lack of social and political expression.
A middle ground is still possible. Countries such as Brazil and England demonstrate that respect for human rights and public opinion can be maintained even when the executive branch has the power to pass smart and simple policies.
In 2008, Obama seemed to have the potential to move the United States closer to this more optimal balance of power between branches of government. Unfortunately, he seems to have neglected this duty and after the next elections, he will likely wish that he had not.

And one more thought… (I like multiple posts LOL)… Brookings describes itself as non-partisan (not bipartisan, Jonny), but even Time, the NYT and the LA Times have described it as liberal or left-leaning. Know your sources. 
As for “working out what is in the bill” that should have been done before it was passed, no? Like Obama promised, it should have been out there for everyone to dissect before they rammed it through, no? What were they afraid of?
Finally, that figure of 40 million uninsured is suspect. Our health care system was not broken; it was not perfect. Without repeal, it will certainly be worse now.
Also, I fail to see how calling Glenn Beck a “whack job” contributes to the discussion. He has an excellent grasp of history and some strong viewpoints that again, align with a majority of Americans. Your venom buys us nothing.
Jonny, there’s a reason there’s a big push for repeal of Obamacare. It is an unprecedented power grab by the federal government involving both intrusion into your personal liberties and (as has been increasingly admitted by the Democrats) soaring costs THAT OUR COUNTRY CAN’T AFFORD. Even if it was the best plan in the world, we can’t afford it, and so it’s out of the question. The fact that some Republicans agreed with it only shows why many of those same Republicans are also being voted out of office (as some already have been via the primaries).
But Bob Dole wanted Republicans to back Obamacare. One of the ladies from Maine voted to get it out of committee. Why not try working out what is in the Bill, rather than rely on what whack-jobs like Glenn Beck tell you. Check out the bipartisan Brookings Institution’s Healthcare 101. Obamacare is about insuring more than 40 million people who were without health insurance (in the richest country in the world), trying to start to get a handle on health care cost inflation (see the OMB’s chart on projected costs under the old system), and providing some subsidies (by taxing unneccesarily subsidized Cadillac Plans- where he took on the unions) so that people could afford the plan. The old system was broken- check the WHO’s league tables on health systems.
Oh and for the record — not wanting our government to be like China’s — thinking we need fewer laws/less regulation — and just saying no to Obamacare… these are not “far right.” These are in the absolute mainstream of American opinion, my friend. It is the leftist namecallers like yourself who are on the far fringe… so far out, you apparently can’t see clearly.
Steve, what are you doing here being hateful by calling my legitimate comments “hate”? That’s so LEFT of you… presenting no arguments, relying on namecalling.
Why is Diane also on here spewing her far-right hate? Has she not got better things to do with her time?
I remain astonished by Daniel Charnoff’s naivete. 
First, the checks and balances are there for a reason. You are blaming THEM for a 2500 page healthcare bill? Or are you blaming the Republicans? Why not just blame Bush? What a crock of crap. Daniel, do you not understand that MOST Americans do not support the healthcare bill? That’s why Republicans (and some Democrats) kept saying “no.” Not to be “obstructionist” — BUT TO PREVENT BAD LAW. It’s not 2500 pages because of the Republicans — it’s 2500 pages because the number of pages of a bill is directly proportional to how bad it is. And, methinks the Dems were trying to hide some s**t in there, too.
It’s terribly amusing that the first “strong executive” you point to is in China. I know, you went on to use England as an example, but England is of course far closer to our system than is China’s. Again, I find it sad that I must point this out to an “international relations” major, but we don’t want a “strong executive like in China” who can make law. That’s not his job, son. Have you that little appreciation for the amazing system of government that has served us so well in this country? Do international relations majors spend no time on that? That, too, is very sad. And if the “age of CNN and Rush Limbaugh” keeps everyone accountable — Daniel, that’s a really good thing. Or do you think it’s better if everything happens under the radar? How naive is that?
Finally, you have an outright howler of a lie in this article. Republicans have not been generally mute on how to fix things. Numerous proposals and plenty of ideas are out there (ever listen to Rush? He’s offered a forum for quite a few ideas) — you, my young would-be policymaker, are not listening. From the “progressive” drivel you publish, I deduce that you don’t care to listen. Ironically, it’s all about stopping spending — which brings us back to why Republicans say “no.” Generally, we don’t need more laws. We need less.

Try to recall the last time you were stuck in L.A. traffic — not hard, I know. Reminisce on the blissful view of glaring red brake lights and miles of gridlock speckled with the occasional rabid driver muscling into your lane. Now remember that cheeky yellow sticker snickering at you as the tail of some Toyota Prius speeds gleefully toward campus in the carpool lane. You feel a bitterness toward the  Prius and other carpool-approved vehicles as you realize that they will get to class on time and you will not.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
But perhaps you should consider investing in such a car. On Aug. 30, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Measure SB 535, which permits up to 40,000 more high-efficiency, alternative-fuel vehicles single-occupant access to carpool lanes. Despite the knee-jerk reaction that allowing certain drivers to cruise the carpool lane all by their lonesome defeats the lane’s purpose, this is actually a progressive and environmentally friendly move.
Solo-access usage for electric vehicles was set to expire in January 2011, but this bill and another extended the privilege until January 2015. The yellow sticker advantage for hybrids was also set to end in January 2011, but the termination date has been pushed back to June 2011 to allow drivers the opportunity to upgrade to more fuel-efficient vehicles that meet the new standards.
All-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell cars have been granted carpool access unfettered by passenger requirements until 2015. Top-of-the-line plug-ins such as the extended-range electric Chevrolet Volt must wait until 2012 for the perk, but all-electric cars such as the up-and-coming Nissan Leaf are immediately eligible.
Though some Southern Californians object to the measure, — their minds on rush hour and an increased freeway bottleneck, — it should actually prove reasonably successful with negligible traffic effects, according to data from the end of the 2007 extension. Our current state of driving-related affairs leaves much to be desired: As gas prices have plunged to about $3, down from a record-breaking $4 in 2007, demand for alternative-fuel vehicles has declined as well. The new extensions are a tantalizing incentive for drivers to transition from traditional gas-guzzling vehicles to socially conscious, eco-friendly rides.
With several leading manufacturers sporting green vehicles that will land in U.S. markets within the next 18 months, SB 535 can jumpstart our floundering auto industry — the California Chronicle reports that the 2004 program paved the way for the purchase of more than 100,000 hybrids. According to USA Today, the yellow sticker also increased a vehicle’s resale value by an average of $4,000. Consumers wary of the pricetag on these high-efficiency vehicles could be persuaded as the benefits add up.
Opponents of the bill questioned if the incentives would result in additional cars from shared riders and bus patrons jumping to individual green-energy cars. Admittedly, the increased traffic on car-clogged freeways could potentially overcrowd the carpool lanes and thus annul its “fast-lane” purpose.
A 2008 Caltrans report, however, found only a 6 percent increase from 2006 in carpool lane congestion following the original 75,000 sticker allowances in 2007. The new provision caps eligibility at 40,000 vehicles, presumably to allow even less congestion than the previous program. Current estimates predict that the 40,000 figure will not be reached for about two years.
What about those who wonder whether sharing rides is more efficient than a solo occupant hybrid?
It’s important to realize that the vehicles seeking sticker qualifications must first meet the California Environmental Protection Agency’s “most stringent Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) tailpipe emission standard, have zero evaporative emissions and use a zero emission fuel such as electricity or hydrogen” as stated by the EPA’s Air Resource Board. These stiff and exacting standards leave no room to doubt the environmental sustainability of the vehicles allotted the access stickers.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, passenger cars got an average of 22.6 miles per gallon in 2008, while Toyota promises a 51/48 miles per gallon city and highway miles per gallon for its 2011 Prius. A speedy back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that opponents of the new regulations would have to sardine themselves six to a car to match the energy efficiency of a single-driver, next-generation hybrid.
I wish them the best of luck with that — maybe we will see them on the freeway, our golden badges of honor laughing as we speed away.

Look…it’s really not that complicated. If we got rid of all the people who are illegally here, our Freeways (& Hospitals, & Prisons, Schools, etc.) would be virtually problem free. Ne xt time you’re stuck in traffic on the freeway….look around you at the other drivers & you’ll see whatImtalkingabout!
It’s about time California has the same carpool lane laws as the state of Arizona. In Arizona the car pool lane is only a car pool lane from 6:00-9:00 am and 3:00-7:00pm anytime between those times it is a regular lane. On weekends no rules apply. The original intent of the car pool lane in California was for Two people of DRIVING age. Now anyone applies as a passenger. The intent of the law was good at the time but the original laws were thrown away a long time ago.

Most universities pay their professors a set salary each year based on a signed contract; in an effort to save money and improve the quality of education, however, the Texas A&M University System has decided to pay its professors based on performance.
“The plan has not been warmly received by faculty,” the Huffington Post reported. “A&M’s chapter head of the American Association of University Professors, Peter Hugill, called the prospect a ‘silly measure.’”
The plan will affect professors at 11 of the universities in the Texas A&M System; professors will be evaluated based on their salary, funding received based on external research and earned money from teaching.
“Any analysis that can enhance the education of students and make the best use of taxpayer money is a good thing for the university,” Adam Myers, a senior lecturer in the Mays Business School, told the Bryan-College Station Eagles. “But merely looking at the raw numbers without some analysis of the information that gives one knowledge of why the numbers are the way they are would be insufficient.”

Former USC quarterback Aaron Crop made his debut for the Richmond Spiders over the weekend with mixed results.
A backup for USC quarterback Matt Barkley last year, Corp completed 18-of-32 passes for 183 yards and had one interception in Richmond’s 34-13 loss against Virginia Saturday. Corp also had a 32-yard run during a crucial drive in the fourth quarter in an attempt to bring Richmond back in the game.
Down 28-13 and starting on his own 10-yard line, Corp drove the team to the Virginia 29-yard line. But just when it seemed like he regained Richmond’s momentum, he gave it away when a deep pass was picked off on the goal line.
“It was a momentum killer,” Corp told The Collegian. “When I let it go, I thought there was some contact [on the receiver], but obviously that’s not my call.”
Despite that interception, first-year coach Latrell Scott channeled his inner Dennis Green in his praise of Corp.
“He’s what we thought he was,” Scott told the Richmond-Times Dispatch. “He’s savvy. He’s a leader. I think he made plays with his feet. He made good decisions.”
Corp’s former team plays Virginia this weekend, which means the Trojans will be watching tape of their former quarterback this week as they look to break down the Cavaliers’ defense.

Recent efforts to modernize the retail and dining options available at Los Angeles International Airport have been severely delayed due to bureaucratic problems within the Los Angeles City Council.
According to the Los Angeles Times, members of the Board of Airport Commissioners were close to reaching a vote on food and retail additions to LAX in April. Upon learning that board President Alan Rothenberg held shares of stock in a restaurant seeking a contract with the airport, however, Carmen Trutanich, L.A. city attorney, elected to disqualify the entire board.
These delays have resulted in much frustration for the owners of the companies seeking to receive a contract bid from the airport.
“We are mostly small, locally-run businesses, and it’s just impossible to plan because this thing is just in limbo,” Richard Karno, owner of Groundwork Coffee Co., told the Times.
Many of the business owners are seeking the help of lobbyists to increase their chances of gaining a spot in LAX. Nevertheless, it will still take a great deal of time before the board will make any concrete decisions.
“No matter how much people want to talk about lobbying and donations, that doesn’t take away from the fact that this process was a bad process,” said Jerold Neuman, a lawyer involved in the dispute, in an interview with the Times.

After a ruinous offseason for the USC football program, things finally seemed to be picking up for the Trojans as they snagged their first win Thursday night in Hawaii.
But along with today’s gloomy weather came news that former USC running back Reggie Bush will officially be stripped of his Heisman Trophy from the 2005 season — another chunk gone from the Pete Carroll era.
Yahoo! Sports reported that unnamed cited sources close to the Heisman Trophy Trust will take away the trophy before the end of September, after the NCAA finishes up its investigation regarding Bush’s eligibility during his playing days with the Trojans.
In June, the NCAA ruled Bush ineligible to play during the 2004-2005 season during which time he received improper benefits — USC also had to vacate all wins from that season. The university had already removed Bush’s trophy from Heritage Hall.
If the sources are correct, he will become the first player to be stripped of the prestigious award in its 75-year history.
