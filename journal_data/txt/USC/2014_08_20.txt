For many returning students, the events surrounding Welcome Week will bring back some fond memories. It might have been the place where they met their current roommate, or the group of friends they hang out with, or the time they found out that USC has a lot of random free food and awesome events because, well, it’s USC.
USC’s Welcome Week 2014 is shaping up to be just as exciting as in years past, and USC Student Affairs has put together a plethora of events to make sure every Trojan, new or returning, can kick off the semester the right way.
For up-to-the-minute reminders on event times, locations and news on the Welcome Back Concert and 2014 Comedy Show headliner, follow the Daily Trojan Twitter account @DailyTrojan.
An overview of some of the events occurring during Welcome Week | Design by Matt Burke
In the meantime, here’s a list of places and things to check out during Welcome Week 2014:
Taste of ’SC
Ronald Tutor Campus Center, 5 p.m.
Welcome Week kicks off with a recetption for incoming students and their families. Expect free food, drinks, friendly introductions and hearty speeches.
Why you should go: It’s the perfect time for a break from all the organizing and unpacking. Forget about the piles of luggage lined up outside the dorm room for an hour or so.
 
Taste of Annenberg
Founders Park & EF Hutton Park, 11 a.m. Incoming Annenberg students only.
Incoming Annenberg students are invited to attend a discussion led by Dean Ernest J. Wilson III and Annenberg faculty. Lunch will be provided and booths from various student organizations will be present in case you want to take your first step in getting involved on campus as a future media professional.
Why you should go: Take advantage of the event and get to know future professors and classmates before class
even begins. Ask about the new Wallis Annenberg Hall and learn more about how to get involved with the different organizations and departments within the college.
 
USC Recreational Sports: Rec Fest
Brittingham Field, 4 p.m.
So you might not be one of the select few student athletes attending USC on an athletic scholarship, but that doesn’t mean you can’t play! Rec Fest invites all students to check out potential opportunities to participate in recreational sports as well as information on workout classes and intramurals.
Why you should go: There’s nothing more exciting than signing up for a new sport with a new friend– Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or polo, anyone? You could also pursue your unfulfilled dreams as a knuckle ball pitcher, or just get more information about getting brawny and staving off the dreaded freshman fifteen.
 
Spark! Visions and Voices
Bovard Auditorium, 5:30 p.m., Doors at 4:45 p.m.
Pack into Bovard Auditorium for a night celebrating diversity in the arts. DJ duo Urban Assault opens an energetic pre-show for a lineup that includes poetry, classical guitar and a contemporary dance company.
Why you should go: Visions and Voices consistently puts out some of the most interesting arts events throughout the semester — this is a great opportunity to get acquainted with one of the best arts initiatives the University has to offer.
 
Highlighter Dance presented by RSG
McCarthy Quad, 9 p.m. 
Dress in your least favorite plain white shirt and head to McCarthy Quad to meet up with other freshmen and dance to some of the summer’s best Top 40 music. Come prepared to get messy and dance the night away.
Why you should go: It’s Thursday night, there’s no class the next day and there’s a dance at McCarthy Quad. Why wouldn’t you go?
 
Panhellenic Recruitment Orientation
Bovard Auditorium, 8 a.m.
If you’re planning on joining a sorority in the USC Panhellenic Council, wake up early and attend this mandatory information session for potential new members. Meet the Panhellenic Executive Board, the recruitment counselors and learn about recruitment rules and guidelines through entertaining skits.
Why you should go: If you’re planning on joining a sorority, it’s mandatory.
 
Trojan Traditions: Then and Now
Ronald Tutor Campus Center, 1 p.m.
If you’ve ever seen the deranged, shirtless fans painted cardinal and gold at the front of the student section during USC football games, those are the Trojan Knights. Away from the field they’re usually more tame and fully clothed, but no less passionate about being Trojans. The Knights will host a special information session about some of USC’s unique history and traditions.
Why you should go: Nobody wants to be “that guy or girl” at the first home football game of the season who doesn’t know the SoCal shout, or asks why everyone is so vehemently signaling for peace during a football game.
 
How to Get Involved
Seeley G. Mudd (SGM), 1 p.m.
If you go to USC and just attend classes and go to your internship for four years, you’re probably not doing it right. There are literally hundreds of ways to get involved at USC and start contributing to the Trojan Family right away. Find out more about ways to get involved at this seminar led by current USC student leaders.
Why you should go: Because for countless students, campus organizations are a great place to meet fellow Trojans with similar interests.
 
USC GeoScavenge 
Tommy Trojan (Hahn Plaza), 2 p.m.
Join in a scavenger hunt that will have students looking for various landmarks and clues to discover some of the lesser known parts of USC’s campus.
Why you should go: Because you’re going to realize this campus really isn’t as small as it looks when you were looking it up on Google Maps.
 
Trojan Pride Rally
Tommy Trojan (Hahn Plaza), 6 p.m. New students only.
Dress in some (close-toed) walking shoes and your best USC gear and be prepared to learn more about USC’s proud traditions. Kick the flagpoles for the first time as a student and take an insider tour of the historic LA Coliseum as you learn more about the incredible successes of our student athletes over the years.
Why you should go: Because this will be the only appropriate time all year where you won’t have to push your way through a mob of tailgaters to stub your toe on a flagpole.
 
Trojan Pool Party
Uytengsu Aquatics Center (UAC), 9:30 p.m. New students only.
New students are invited to USC’s state-of-the-art Uytengsu Aquatics Center for a good old-fashioned pool party.
Why you should go: That pool is really, really nice.
 
Saturday, Aug. 23
Friends and Neighbors Day
Volunteer Center, 6:30 a.m.
Wake up (really) early, bring some friends and make some new ones at one of the most rewarding experiences offered to students at USC. Students can sign up at one of many volunteering opportunities to serve the community around campus. Friends and Neighbors Day is a highlight of many Trojans’ semesters and it’s an excellent opportunity to go out and do some honest work and help someone in need.
Why you should go: It really is one of the most rewarding things you’ll do all semester. Helping the community around USC is not just a Trojan’s duty: it’s just part of who we are.
 
All-Greek Recruitment BBQ
Alumni Park, 4  p.m.
If you’re so inclined, being part of Greek life can be one of many rewarding and lasting sources of friendship and community at USC. Those who plan on joining a Greek organization can talk to current members and learn more about the semester-long process.
Why you should go: If you’re not planning on going Greek, you can at least go get some burgers.
 
Welcome Back Carnival
McCarthy Quad, 5 p.m.
Snow cones, cotton candy and carnival games out in McCarthy Quad offer a relaxing, idyllic preface to the highly anticipated Welcome Back Concert.
Why you should go: Snow cones, cotton candy and carnival games.
 
Welcome Back Concert
McCarthy Quad, 7 p.m.
University Student Government and USC Program Board are mum on the headliner at the moment, but the Welcome Back Concert is one of the premiere musical events of the semester. Past performers have included Katy Perry, Cold War Kids, Hellogoodbye and White Panda.
Why you should go: Rumor has it this year’s headliner is going to be huge. In either case, virtually every USC student should have reported to campus by now, and expect practically all of them to be there.
 
Comedy Show 
McCarthy Quad, 7 p.m.
No word on who the headliner might be, but the Comedy Show is a truly underrated part of the Welcome Week experience. Past performers have included stand-up comedian Jerrod Carmichael and Conan writer Deon Cole.
Why you should go: Sure, it’s the night before classes start — but it’s the night before classes start. Everyone’s probably going to need a few laughs.
 
USC Involvement Fair
Trousdale Parkway and Alumni Park, beginning 11 a.m.
This event, held at the first week each semester, is an opportunity to become acquainted with over 300 student organizations. Fancy a round of DoTA 2? Maybe USC E-Sports is your speed. Want to spend your Tuesday and Thursday nights poring over case briefs and sharpening your legal analysis skills? The USC Mock Trial team might be right for you. No matter what you enjoy doing, there’s a group for it at USC.
Why you should go: Because four years at USC is way too short a time to spend solely on classes and internships. On a very serious note, involvement in these student-run organizations are what make USC such a great place to go to school.

Despite the Interfraternity Council’s temporary expulsion of the Kappa Sigma fraternity last May and an ongoing investigation of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity for an alleged sexual assault, members of the IFC and the Panhellenic Council look forward to beginning a new year of Greek social life at USC, albeit with some changes in the recruitment process.
IFC President Tanner Sandoval said that social life on The Row will be virtually the same as in recent years.
Sandoval credits the Greek community with adhering to the new restrictions, which limit the number of parties held from Friday after 3 p.m. through Sunday at 5 p.m. and institute a social draft system to determine which houses are permitted to host parties during the allotted times. “We’ve lowered the amount of Greek transports, and we’ve also improved our relationship with [the Dept. of Public Safety],” Sandoval said.
IFC’s judicial board can impose sanctions on houses for a variety of infractions, including DPS write-ups and “dirty rushing,” or holding illegal rush events outside those regularly scheduled. The judicial board’s initial decision to expel Kappa Sigma in May came after such sanctions.
As of Aug. 5, however, the IFC Executive Board and the University made the decision to revoke Kappa Sigma’s expulsion. Kappa Sigma will continue operating at USC, but will be suspended from the IFC for the fall 2014 semester and cannot recruit or hold social functions.
Some USC students worry that the environment at parties remains threatening.
Jasmine Collins, a senior majoring in international relations, said that she and her friends take caution at Greek parties.
“I’ve had fun at Greek parties in the past. But my friends and I feel like given how crowded it is, and what the environment is, you have to be careful. Last time [we went], we ended up getting harassed by some guy,” she said.
Sexual harassment and assault are continual concerns for the IFC. ATO is facing investigation by USC’s Title IX office for a possible sexual assault allegation. Title IX is a federal regulation that prohibits educational discrimination on the basis of gender.
“It’s up to the Title IX office to make the final decision [about ATO]. No one knows the outcome yet or what the severity [of the punishment] will be,” Sandoval said.
Allegations of widespread sexual assault across college campuses in the United States have exposed Greek organizations to particular scrutiny.
“It’s unfortunate that there’s a kind of stigma [about Greek life]. It’s never [The Row] as a whole. It’s five people who end up causing problems for everyone,” Sandoval said.
Though changes in social policy have largely been spearheaded by IFC, Panhellenic is implementing its own changes in recruitment this fall. The council voted to ban door stack, a sorority rush week tradition that dates back to the 1980s, according to Panhellenic President Katherine Grabar.
“Door stack is essentially a spirited song that takes place in a sorority’s door, with girls lying in the front door of their house and singing to new members,” Grabar said. “With the removal of door stack there’s more time for active members to talk to new members.”
Both IFC and Panhellenic are trying to raise the profile of philanthropy on The Row, with several events scheduled, such as a Greek Philanthropy for Kids.
All in all, Sandoval thinks that 2014 is a promising year for Greek students at USC.
“As frustrated as a lot of people have been, we are lucky to be doing the things that we do,” Sandoval said.

The USC offensive and defensive lines enter the 2014 campaign with  aspirations to be some of the best units in the nation.
The Trojans’ defensive line, which was among the nation’s best in 2013, will once again be anchored by junior defensive end and highly touted NFL Draft prospect Leonard Williams, who has his attention centered only on his team and the season ahead for the time being.
Lion King · Junior defensive end Leonard Williams (94), who earned All-American honors in 2013 despite playing the entire season with a torn labrum, will bolster the Trojans’ defensive line in 2014. The Florida native recorded 74 tackles, including 13.5 tackles for loss, in 2013. – Daily Trojan File Photo
“I’m just focused on having a great season this year,” Williams said. “I’m so ready … we’ve got new coaches, a new team, and we’re just looking past all the old, bad stuff in the past.”
New defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox is inheriting a unit that  thrived in former defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s 5-2 scheme and was ranked No. 1 in the Pac-12 in total defense last season.
The defensive line returns starters in junior defensive tackle Antwaun Woods and Williams, but will most likely look to junior college transfer Claude Pelon or Texas Tech transfer Delvon Simmons to fill former defensive lineman George Uko’s role.
Williams will undoubtedly be the centerpiece of USC’s front seven, and therefore will be the point of interest for opposing offensive lines.
Opposing teams will likely double-team Williams, allowing for the players around him to break out.
Williams has been impressed by Pelon and Simmons, and he raved about Woods.
“I kind of expected that I’d be getting double-teamed a lot this year, but we have a lot of guys coming in like Claude [Pelon] and Delvon [Simmons], and Antwaun Woods is going to step up and be big this year,” Williams said.
Woods injured his elbow in fall camp but should be ready to go by the start of the season on Aug. 30 against Fresno State.
On the other hand, the offensive line, under the direction of first-year coach Tim Drevno, comes into this season with perhaps the most question marks out of any position group after allowing 34 sacks last season, ranking 104th in the nation.
As of now, it looks like redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler will have a young, inexperienced line with three potential first-time starters.
To add more uncertainty, the team is learning a new up-tempo offense under head coach Steve Sarkisian and has a new starting center in junior Max Tuerk, who has slid over from left guard to fill the void that former starting center Marcus Martin left after departing for the NFL.
Besides Tuerk, the only other experience on the line, at least at the beginning of the year, will come from redshirt sophomore Chad Wheeler at left tackle, who started every game for the Trojans in 2013.
It looks like true freshman Toa Lobendahn might start at left guard as senior offensive lineman Aundrey Walker struggles to overcome a lingering ankle injury, while redshirt freshman Khaliel Rodgers is in line to start at right guard.
Sarkisian emphasized the importance of the unit staying healthy.
“We need eight really good guys that can rotate through for our season to be really successful,” Sarkisian said. “We would love the luxury of 10, but eight is good enough so that’s what we’re trying to get.”

Coming off a losing 2013 season that culminated in the firing of head coach Ali Khosroshahin, USC’s women’s soccer team appeared to be reeling a bit heading into the offseason last winter. Despite starting 3-0-1, the Women of Troy would go on to finish 8-10-2. Of the 10 losses, eight were by just one goal, including five by a score of 1-0, resulting in feelings of frustration and disappointment for the Women of Troy. To add insult to injury, the rival UCLA Bruins went on to win the NCAA Division I Championship, leaving a bitter aftertaste to what started as a very promising season.
Sharp shooter · Junior forward Katie Johnson scored five goals in 20 games for the Women of Troy last season. She was often the opposing goalie’s nightmare, putting a team-high 27 shots on goal in 2013. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Perhaps the most frustrating part of last season for the team is the fact that, on paper, the Women of Troy appeared to have outplayed the opposition in multiple areas: USC outscored opponents 31-27 on the season and outshot opponents on goal 140-108 (350-199 in overall shots).
Although the 2013 season did not end well for the Women of Troy, the aforementioned feelings of frustration and disappointment only lingered briefly, as the mid-December hiring of new head coach Keidane McAlpine marked an upswing in the outlook and morale of the team.
McAlpine, coming to USC from Washington State, boasts an impressive résumé: in two seasons as head coach, he led the Cougars to two NCAA Tournament appearances and a second-place finish in the Pac-12 last season — the best ever for the Cougars.
Now at USC, McAlpine has wasted no time in redefining the culture and attitude of the program, and the players have responded, says senior captain and goalkeeper Caroline Stanley.
“There has definitely been a huge change since Keidane took over,” Stanley said. “The program is moving towards a much more family-oriented culture. … Everyone has a voice, everyone has a role and the importance of each individual player buying into their role and contributing to the team has really been emphasized.”
Clearly, Stanley and her teammates have bought in to the changes being made by McAlpine and his coaching staff. The confidence that the women have in their coach is sky high, and that confidence has been reciprocated by coach McAlpine himself toward the team that he now calls his own.
“This team has a lot of talent and athletic ability, and the girls arrived at workouts in better shape than I expected,” McAlpine said. “A key is confidence, especially after a season like last year, where this team was in a bit of a slump. But if we focus on the little details, form the right habits and buy into the family aspect of playing harder not for oneself but for one another, we will be successful.”
Much of the success that the coaches and players are looking to achieve will be dependent on some of the younger players on the team. With just four seniors on the roster, there is a lot riding on the ability of the younger players to rise to the occasion when their number is called. But as seniors and captains, Stanley and Jessica Musmanno aren’t worried about the state of the team.
“There are plenty of younger players that are going make an impact for us,” Musmanno said.
Stanley provided equally positive praise of her teammates.
“At the end of the day, when you step onto the field, you have to trust deep down that each girl on your left and right is capable of getting the job done. And I truly feel that way about all the girls on this team,” she said
From top to bottom, this team is building a level of trust and confidence in one another that will almost certainly pay dividends when regular season matches begin.
There will be plenty of opportunities for the Women of Troy to prove their prowess during the season: five of the nine non-conference games this year will be played against teams that finished with records over the .500 mark last season.
The always-challenging Pac-12 conference season kicks off on Sept. 26 at Arizona, and will feature key games against Colorado, California, Washington State, Stanford and top-ranked UCLA.
Despite the tough schedule, the players are optimistic.
“I have high expectations for this team,” Stanley said. “The girls on this team are tired of losing by one goal. We are ready to win. And we know that some of the Pac-12 may not currently see us as a team to worry about. But it’s clear to me and the rest of the girls on this team that when we step out onto the field and face our opponents, they will see that we are a threat.”
The Women of Troy kick off their season on Aug. 22 against Long Beach State.

For a group that was characterized by a superstar and a supporting cast last year, the USC skill position group this year will feature more of an ensemble.
The most noteworthy departure from the group is that of Marqise Lee. Lee, the second-round draft pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2014 NFL Draft, set or tied 17 USC records between 2011 and 2013, as well as five Pac-12 records. In 2012, he set the record for most receptions in a season with 118, most receiving yards in a season with 1,721 and most receiving yards in a game with 345 when the Trojans fell 39-36 at Arizona on Oct. 27. Lee won the Biletnikoff Award that year as the best receiver in the country, finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting and expectations were high for him going into his junior year.
Many expected Lee to declare for the draft at the end of the year and fall somewhere in the first round. Having three head coaches, two play-callers, two quarterbacks and various injury problems prevented him from reaching 100 percent. His receptions and receiving yard numbers were cut by more than half from the year before, with only 791 yards over 57 catches.
Despite the drop-off, Lee still led the team in receptions in 2013. His 3,655 career receiving yards are most all-time at USC, and his 248 career receptions are second.
If there is a new star in the skill position group, this year’s will be junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor. Agholor led USC in receiving yards and touchdowns last year with 918 and six, respectively.
Agholor may also see a drop in numbers as he becomes the top target and opposing teams match their best defensive back against the wideout. But there are plenty of other options redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler will have to throw to besides Agholor.
The two other noteworthy returning targets are sophomore Darreus Rogers, who hauled in 22 catches for 257 yards, and redshirt junior Victor Blackwell, who caught four passes for 49 yards. The more important returning duo, however, may be the two highly touted receivers coming off of season-ending injuries last year.
Redshirt junior George Farmer and redshirt freshman Steven Mitchell both missed all of last season with knee injuries but look to make a big impact this season at the wide receiver position. Farmer played sparingly in 2011 and 2012, while Mitchell’s season will be his first as a healthy player. Farmer caught four passes as a freshman and one pass his sophomore year.
First-year head coach Steve Sarkisian praised Farmer and the rest of the receiving corps at Pac-12 Media Day.
“[Farmer’s] in great shape,” Sarkisian said. “Out of the knee brace, in a really good frame of mind. I’m hopeful George is going to play the way he looks like he can play, because he’s still the fastest guy on our team after the knee surgery. He’s still a big, physical guy with a really good skill set. If George plays the way he’s capable of playing, that’s a really good tandem when Nelson Agholor’s on the other side. And you have Darreus Rogers, throw in a Steven Mitchell, that group is really talented, plus some young players coming up.”
Sarkisian said some of the defensive players on the roster might even get some work in at receiver. Five-star recruit and incoming freshman Adoree’ Jackson, who starred on both sides of the ball at Serra High School in Gardena, California, is the most notable of these potential two-way players. Primarily a defensive back, he has gotten reps in practice as a running back and receiver.
“[Adoree’ is] a very talented young man,” Sarkisian said. “He’s an explosive athlete, a world-class long jumper. He can run. He can do a lot of things.”
Sarkisian also mentioned that fellow defensive back Rahshead Johnson, an incoming freshman and four-star recruit, may play receiver. JuJu Smith, another five-star recruit signed by Sarkisian, primarily plays linebacker but may also play as a receiver.
The versatility doesn’t stop there, as many of the running backs got in on the receiving game last year as well. Redshirt juniors Javorius “Buck” Allen and Tre Madden both had more than 200 receiving yards last year. Four of Madden’s 15 grabs went for touchdowns while one of Allen’s 22 ended in the end zone.
While they’ll certainly be options again in the passing game, the two will likely carry the weight of the carries on the rushing game. Sarkisian promises that the team will run the ball a lot on offense, and the options don’t end at Madden or Allen in that department.
Allen led the team last year with 785 yards, 14 touchdowns and 5.8 yards per carry. Madden led the team with 138 carries, three more than Allen, and recorded 703 yards with three scores.
The unit loses Silas Redd, who signed with the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent after graduating, and Ty Isaac, who transferred to Michigan to be closer to his ailing mother. Redd ran for 376 yards on 81 carries, both third most on the team, and scored one touchdown. Isaac’s 40 carries and 246 yards were fifth-most on the team, and he recorded two touchdowns.
Justin Davis also returns at running back. His 53 attempts and 361 yards were fourth-best on the team, and his six touchdowns trailed only Allen. What’s more impressive is that Davis accomplished that in only seven games before an ankle injury ended his freshman season.
Another back returning to the mix is D.J. Morgan, a redshirt senior who also missed last year with a knee injury. Lastly, walk-on redshirt freshman James Toland IV may play a minor role in the offense if the depth is tested.
Sarkisian cited his coaching history as proof that the Trojan running game will be impressive this season.
“Our guy last year at Washington rushed for over 1,900 yards, so I believe in running the football,” Sarkisian said. “We’re going to run the football. We’re a run-first football team. My five years as a head coach I’ve had a thousand-yard rusher every year, so I don’t suspect that will change this fall.”
Sarkisian has also demonstrated success developing tight ends, demonstrated by Washington’s Austin Seferian-Jenkins, who won the Mackey Award as the nation’s top tight end.
The Trojans lost Xavier Grimble to the draft, but return senior tight end Randall Telfer, who caught six passes for 78 yards and a touchdown last season. Junior tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick was expected to step up this year, but was recently ruled academically ineligible for the season, giving senior Chris Willson and true freshman Bryce Dixon the opportunity to step up at the tight end position.
Though it may not be the case for the rest of the team, the skill positions do have plenty of depth if injuries force backups into a larger role. If the unit can avoid any more injuries, defenses across the Pac-12 will have to prepare for a lot of different assignments.

A lot of crazy stuff went down in the world this summer. If I wasn’t writing this column for a university publication, I would probably use a different noun starting with an S than “stuff,” because almost all of this “stuff” was really, really “stuffy.” Sorry, I mean really, really bad.
Planes crashed in Ukraine, Taiwan and Mali, killing hundreds of people; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalated to new heights, with death tolls estimated in the thousands; instability in Iraq led President Obama to order air strikes in the region — all on the 100th anniversary of World War I, which caused the Second World War, which caused the Cold War, which caused and is still causing plenty of its own wars. Did I mention that the plane crash in Ukraine was caused not by a mechanical failure, but by a missile?
Closer to home, an incoming USC student was killed at the beach by a lightning bolt. A USC grad student was viciously murdered just north of campus after a group study session for a summer class. A USC alumnus and U.S. Army general was killed in action in Afghanistan, and a USC medical student who went missing on Aug. 8 still hadn’t been found as of press time.
But for a month, everything in the world seemed fine. Maybe that’s because I’m an ignorant sports fan, but the world seemed to have turned everything off for 32 days in June and July.
For those precious 32 days, the only thing that mattered was the World Cup.
I would talk with my Spanish-speaking gardeners, asking them “¿Ustedes creen que Mexico ganar el partido mañana con Paises Bajos?” (Do you think Mexico will win tomorrow’s game against the Netherlands?) I had totally forgotten if I was supposed to use the subjunctive or infinitive in that context, (sorry Professor Zarazua), but that didn’t matter. I could watch videos of the Men In Blazers breaking down every matchup on YouTube, laughing hysterically the whole time. The best part, however, was driving anywhere in Los Angeles and seeing an American flag hanging out of a car window and knowing that countless drivers around the world were just as emotionally invested in this joyous occasion as I was.
So needless to say, I’m very, very excited for the start of another year of USC athletics. I’m not implying that sports can stop all violence in the world — though I do find it to be a very interesting coincidence that the official ground invasion of Gaza, the three plane crashes and the air strike all occurred after the World Cup ended on July 13 — but it has a unique ability to bring people together in times of tragedy.
Maybe the losses to the Trojan Family over the summer don’t feel like a collective tragedy, but they absolutely should. Even though I didn’t know any of the four Trojans in the news personally, there’s no cliché I can write here that fully captures the significance of their lives as members of our school. It doesn’t matter how the losses happened, where they happened or who, if anyone, was at fault; what matters is doing what we can to honor the memory of the late Trojans.
Regardless of whether or not our community has reason to mourn, we always have a reason to come together in support of the many Trojan student-athletes that represent us. The fact that these talented, hardworking classmates are dedicated to the idea that being a Trojan is something to be proud of is, well, something to be proud of. It’s a little trite, and somewhat hard to rationalize, but nonetheless still very amazing.
So here’s to all of the brothers of the Greek system coming together to tailgate on campus for game days. The atmosphere on the front lawns of The Row just doesn’t compare to the atmosphere on Trousdale, where USC’s die-hard alumni prove that the term “Trojan Family” is not just some phony PR term used only by student tour guides.
Here’s to coming together as students for the other 20 varsity sports teams, and all the other student organizations on campus. I’m totally guilty myself of focusing on football in my column last year, using the “it’s what people care about” excuse instead of embracing the media’s ability to spark interest in other important activities on campus. I will keep it to USC varsity sports — though I might throw in one or two shoutouts to my teammates on the club lacrosse team — but I promise to write about teams other than football as often as I can.
You probably have the first tailgate of the year against Fresno State on Aug. 30 already on your calendar, but here’s a list of other home openers worth checking out: Men’s and women’s swimming have their first home meet at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Sept. 3 at 2 p.m. Women’s soccer opens at McAlister Field on Sept. 5 against UC Riverside at 4 p.m. Women’s volleyball hosts Texas A&M at 8 p.m. on Sept. 11 in the Galen Center. And the six-time defending national champion men’s water polo team’s first home game at the Uytengsu pool is Oct. 4 against UC Santa Barbara (time TBA). Unfortunately, the men’s and women’s golf teams don’t have any matches on campus, but they both begin their quests for national championships this fall, as do the Trojan tennis teams.
And here’s to what should be another great school year. I’m honored that I’ll get the chance to share my thoughts on it once a week. Welcome back, UCLA sucks and fight on!

Cody Kessler has spent most of his USC career in the shadows. The redshirt junior quarterback arrived on campus in the midst of Matt Barkley’s record-breaking run at the helm of the Trojan offense. Upon Barkley’s graduation, few predicted Kessler would take over the starting position, favoring his bigger, stronger classmate Max Wittek.

Even now, a year removed from running away with the quarterback job during the Trojans’ tumultuous 2013 campaign and winning it once more in spring camp, Kessler remains overlooked. He is routinely ranked as the Pac-12’s fifth or sixth-best signal-caller going into this season, behind the electrifying Marcus Mariota of Oregon, UCLA’s Heisman candidate Brett Hundley and veterans Kevin Hogan of Stanford, Taylor Kelly of Arizona and Sean Mannion of Oregon State. Hundley has dominated the local headlines of late, while the focus of USC’s media coverage remains on new head coach Steve Sarkisian. For many athletes, especially at a position as ego-driven as quarterback, this could become a problem; however, USC fans can rest assured that Kessler is no stranger to adversity.
2011 was an outstanding year for USC football. The Barkley-led Trojans, barred from postseason play due to NCAA sanctions, capped a 10-win season with a 50-0 drubbing of UCLA at the Coliseum. Behind the scenes, things were just as exciting. As Barkley’s decision to remain for his senior season or leave for the NFL loomed, the battle for the backup quarterback job — Barkley’s presumed successor — raged on.
The leader in the clubhouse for much of the fall was a surprise candidate, dual-threat redshirt freshman Jesse Scroggins. Behind him was Wittek, who had enrolled the previous spring after graduating from high school a semester early. Wittek had the size — 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds at 18 years old — and the pedigree — he was considered the third-best high school quarterback prospect in the country by ESPN — to rightfully claim Barkley’s throne. The pair had even went to the same high school, Mater Dei of Santa Ana, California — also the alma mater of former USC gunslinger Matt Leinart. Fourth on the depth chart was Kessler, a short, stocky true freshman out of Bakersfield, California, known for an innate elusiveness in the pocket — but not much else.
As the season progressed, Scroggins fell to injury and Kessler usurped Wittek for the backup job. Still, neither Kessler nor Wittek received any playing time, and both eventually kept their redshirts, leaving the quarterback competition wide open.
By no means was Kessler lightly recruited. He enrolled at USC in the spring of 2011 with an impressive list of offers, including one from head coach Nick Saban at Alabama. But the 6-foot-1, 210-pounder was only a three-star recruit according to ESPN, and was ranked well outside their list of the top 150 high school prospects. He had flaws, to be sure, and his lack of height and arm strength were only more obvious when compared to Wittek’s pure physicality. But just as a long list of college coaches saw during his days at Centennial High School in Bakersfield, Kessler’s value lies outside traditional measurables.
The close of the 2011 season saw good news and bad news for Kessler. Scroggins decided to transfer, leaving Wittek as Kessler’s only competition. Unfortunately, that competition would once again be for the backup job, as Barkley had decided to stay for his senior year. Throughout the spring and into the fall, the two redshirt freshman battled, with Wittek eventually winning out. When Barkley fell to injury midway through a late-season loss to UCLA, Wittek was thrust into action. Instead of looking like the heir apparent USC fans hoped he was, however, Wittek struggled in the spotlight. His arm strength and physical tools were obvious, especially in a close loss to Notre Dame, but he struggled on short and intermediate throws, often looking lost in then-head coach Lane Kiffin’s offense.
Going into 2013, Wittek’s difficulties opened the door for the resilient Kessler to claim the job he had been passed over for the year before. Both quarterbacks saw playing time early in the season, as Kiffin’s eventual firing neared. Neither player amazed, and conservative play-calling handcuffed the entire offense. Still, it became clear that Wittek had holes in his game at least as large as Kessler’s. Worse yet, concerns about Wittek regarding his accuracy and mobility had seemed to worsen from the previous year. Eventually, citing ball control and consistency, Kiffin tapped Kessler for the starting role. The rest is history — USC finished with 10 wins under three different head coaches, and, overshadowed by a dominant defense and resurgent running game, the team’s quarterback completed 65 percent of his passes for nearly 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns. Wittek planned to transfer, but was unable to after failing to graduate on time last spring. Kessler solidified his place as USC’s starter in spring camp, outshining redshirt freshman Max Browne and true freshman Jalen Greene.
For even the most experienced college football experts and hardcore USC fans, Kessler’s rapid improvement during the 2013 season was a great surprise. For his teammates, however, it was long overdue.
“He puts in a lot more work than a lot of guys,” said All-American defensive end Leonard Williams. “That just shows his character. He’s all in for it on the team and he’s ready to put his heart out there for it.”
The opinion that Kessler’s most important skills are intangible is one shared by many around the USC program. Sarkisian, who recruited Kessler while the head coach at Washington, saw something special in the high schooler. “He was ultra-competitive,” Sarkisian said. “He won a lot of games and I think that shows in his play. He has great leadership.”
Kessler and the Trojans’ first test of the 2014 campaign will come in just the second week of the season — a road tilt at Stanford. This type of game could rattle any player; even four-year starter Matt Barkley lost to the Cardinal on the road two seasons ago. Still, betting against Kessler — who threw for 288 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions in a home upset of No. 5 Stanford last year — never seems to be a good idea. Though it can be difficult to put into words exactly what Kessler brings to the table, Williams succinctly explained his confidence in the Pac-12’s sixth-ranked quarterback.
“I wouldn’t want any other quarterback on my team.”
Potential Annenberg candidate: “The pair had even went to the same high school, Mater Dei of Santa Ana, California — also the alma mater of former USC gunslinger Matt Leinart. “

In 2013, the USC women’s volleyball team made it back to the Elite Eight for the second consecutive year but was defeated in a five-set thriller against Washington. At most universities, making it that far would be considered a success, but not at USC — here, anything less than a national championship is a disappointment.
Hit it · Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu was named the 2013 AVCA Freshman of the Year after posting 3.47 kills per set last year. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
USC finished the 2013 campaign with an overall record of 29-6 and a Pac-12 record of 16-4.
One of the staples of this women’s volleyball program is head coach Mick Haley. Haley is entering his 14th season as head coach and is eager to reach the Final Four for what would be his the seventh time during his USC tenure.
Haley always has the same goals for his team, but he said he was sad to see last season end against Washington.
“The goal is always a Final Four appearance and to compete for a national championship,” Haley said. “It’s frustrating especially being ahead two sets and then have two swings to win in the fifth game. We have been on the other side where we have come back and won, it evens out eventually.”
After falling to Washington, the Women of Troy lost only three seniors, but they were crucial losses. All-American libero Natalie Hagglund, All-American middle blocker Alexis Olgard, as well as outside hitter Sara Shaw all graduated last spring. Hagglund and Olgard have continued their volleyball careers by joining USA volleyball rosters since they graduated.
With the new school year comes a new season of women’s volleyball, but this year’s team is younger than previous teams. The Women of Troy only have five upperclassmen compared to its 11 underclassmen. Four starters will be returning to continue their athletic careers at USC.
With last year’s team captain Hagglund leaving, senior setter Hayley Crone has emerged as the team’s new captain.
Crone is one of three seniors on the team and last season she started all 35 matches. She had the most assists on the team and will be filling Hagglund’s shoes as floor general.
“Natalie did a good job being team captain by communicating with the coaches and with the team,” Crone said. “She kept everyone on the same page. I want to fill her shoes by keeping everyone on the same page and taking care of the little things.”
With Crone filling Hagglund’s spot as captain, the next task is to find a replacement in the back row.
The Women of Troy are placing an extra emphasis on passing this season, and have three sophomore liberos on their roster looking to improve. Haley has been impressed by their progress.
“Taylor Whittingham has the game experience and Anne Marie Schmidt has greatly improved. It all depends on who steps up during fall camp,” Haley said.
Haley said he would like to have positions for every player at the start of the year, but since this team is so young, it will be tough.
“[The] first goal is to get players into positions so that they can contribute,” Haley said. “Since this team is so young we have to focus more on the system than on individual fundamentals. We will have to go back during the season and work on the fundamentals while trying to win the conference.”
The system that the team will run is called a 6-2, which means the Women of Troy will use two setters and both will come out of the back row. This system was used last year and both setters — Crone and sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola — are returning. This system worked wonders for last year’s team as it gave them three viable hitters at the net.
Just like the Trojan football team, members of the women’s volleyball team hope to tweak the offense just a bit. Haley would like to use an up-tempo style if the passing is good enough.
Haley noted that the middle blocker position is especially deep for USC. The team has Hannah Schraer in her senior year, Alicia Ogoms as a junior and talented freshman Jordan Dunn in that position.
In her first full season, Schraer had a .348 hitting percentage and 116 blocks on the season, but in her sophomore season, she was sidelined by illness. Schraer said she it was difficult returning to the court, but took it in stride.
“During the season I learned how hard it was to be in season and to try to balance everything,” Schraer said. “You can’t have an off day and you can’t have a bad day.”
Ogoms and Dunn will be fighting for the second middle blocker position behind Schraer. Haley has taken some interest into newcomer Dunn based on the way she plays.
“Dunn is a very exciting and athletic middle blocker,” Haley said. “We have never had anyone as a middle who can pass like her.”
Dunn prepped at Corona High School where she was a two-time All-Big VIII Conference First Team and led her club team to a third place finish at the 2014 Junior National Championships.
Even with an infusion of fresh young talent, the Women of Troy are still highly regarded when it comes to the polls. In the AVCA preseason poll, USC was ranked fifth. In the Pac-12 preseason poll, the coaches picked the Women of Troy to finish second, behind only the Stanford Cardinal. They also named Bricio and sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu to the preseason all-conference team.
Nwanebu and Bricio anchor what might be the most exciting position for the Women of Troy: outside hitter. In 2013, Nwanebu was named the AVCA National Freshman of the Year and earned AVCA All-American First Team honors after leading USC with 3.47 kills per set. Bricio wasn’t far behind, averaging 3.46 kills per set.
Bricio also had a stellar freshman season in 2012, averaging a whopping 4.06 kills per set on her way to being named Volleyball Magazine’s Freshman of the Year.
Nwanebu, Bricio and their teammates open the season on the road against Rider on Aug. 29, while their first home game will be played on Sept. 11 against Texas A&M.
Though USC women’s volleyball team may be young this season, they still have high goals and hope to accomplish what they set out to achieve.
“As a team we want to win out in preseason and conference, make the Final Four and win a national championship,” team captain Crone said. “Maybe fourth time is the charm.”

The USC Trojans enter the 2014 football season with a great deal of buzz surrounding the secondary. The position group has been one of great speculation in the offseason with position shifts, heralded recruits and returning talent all combining to generate intense interest.

As a whole, the secondary had an up-and-down season in 2013 providing suffocating coverage in some games while acting as a glaring weakness in others, namely losses to Arizona State and UCLA. As the group enters a new season with a new defensive coordinator and a new position coach, they will strive for an outstanding performance.
The group will do this while trying to compensate for the loss of Dion Bailey to the NFL. Bailey, a dependable safety for the Trojans in 2013, was also a team leader and considered the anchor of the secondary. This year, converted cornerback Josh Shaw appears primed to take over the role.
Shaw, a 2012 transfer from Florida, was originally recruited as a safety. But positional depth thrust Shaw into the role of cornerback where he has flourished for the Trojans. Transitioning smoothly, Shaw was USC’s de-facto shutdown defensive back. He turned in excellent performances against some of the Pac-12’s top receivers last year.
His performance raised the eyebrows of commentators and scouts alike, as Shaw was rated as one of the top senior cornerbacks by noted draft guru Mel Kiper in the offseason. Additionally, Shaw has embraced the role of mentor this offseason. As a veteran, he has offered leadership and experience to younger defensive backs like freshman Adoree’ Jackson.
“Adoree’ is a hard worker,” Shaw said. “His room is actually right next to mine in the dorm. Adoree’ is really just a guy that wants it.”
Jackson is one of many highly touted recruits who could see some time in the secondary.  Jackson is one of a few freshman athletes, like JuJu Smith and Rahshead Johnson, who could see time on both sides of the ball. While they test the waters on offense, freshman Lamont Simmons and Jonathan Lockett appear to be locked in at cornerback.
Simmons, a recruit from Florida, has been a revelation at camp. His length and speed have impressed players and coaches alike.
“You’re just excited to unwrap what you get when you come into fall camp, and I would say they’ve definitely been pleased with Lamont, and we as a team have been pleased with Lamont’s play so far,” Shaw said.
New defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox has also been impressed by Simmons thus far.
“He has gone up first day and played press man against some of our best receivers,” Wilcox said. “He’s not been perfect by any means, but he’s been competitive.”
The safety position is a bit more settled as returning Freshman All-American Su’a Cravens appears to be building on a stellar breakout campaign. He will joined by Leon McQuay III who came on strong late in the season, demonstrating a great ball-hawking ability.
New defensive backs coach Keith Heyward has a lot of talent to work with in the secondary. If he is able to mold the individuals into a cohesive unit, the Trojans could be giving opposing quarterbacks and wide receivers nightmares all season.

On Thursday, Aug. 7, the NCAA granted autonomy, by a 16-2 vote, to its five richest conferences: the ACC, Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC, collectively called the “Big Five” or “Power Five” conferences. In addition, Notre Dame was granted autonomy, making the autonomy ruling effective for a total of 65 athletic programs.
The autonomy ruling gives the schools the authority to make their own rules in 11 different areas. Among the areas that the 65 schools are expected to focus on include financial aid, career pursuits unrelated to athletics and insurance and career transition.
Using their new flexibility, the 65 schools plan on offering better benefits for student-athletes, including full cost-of-attendance stipends, four-year scholarship guarantees, looser restrictions involving player and agent contact, allowing students to make money through outside career opportunities and allowing universities to help pay for injury insurance. The schools also plan to offer more benefits to the families of athletes, like paying for tickets, travel and parking for families to see their student-athletes play in postseason games.
USC was ahead of the curve in offering multi-year scholarships, as the school announced over the summer that this policy would be implemented in order to provide more security to student-athletes in football and men’s and women’s basketball.
When the NCAA mandated unlimited meals for student-athletes effective Aug. 1, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden vowed to set aside more than $1 million on an “enhanced fueling plan” in another move that demonstrated  his commitment to the welfare of student-athletes.
The other seven areas USC and the other 64 athletic programs can make their own rules in are health and wellness, athletic personnel, academic support, time demands, meals and nutrition, pre-enrollment expenses and support and recruiting restrictions.
Though the Power Five have been granted a large amount of autonomy, the NCAA will remain the enforcer of on-field play rules, transfer policies and signing day protocol. In addition, while student-athletes will likely see better benefits, student-athletes will still not be allowed to negotiate compensation with their university and conferences in the Power Five can’t offer more scholarships than other NCAA Division I conferences.
In addition to making their own rules, the Power Five will also have their own committee to vote on autonomy issues. Each of the 65 schools will have one representative, with the other 15 members (three from each conference) being current players.
Conferences not included in the Power Five are allowed to adopt similar rules, but most schools wouldn’t be able to afford them. For example, the Pac-12 racked up $334 million in revenue during the last fiscal year. During the same fiscal year, the Sun Belt Conference (comprising schools such as Arkansas State, Idaho and New Mexico State) brought in only $16.6 million in revenue, which would make it nearly impossible for the conference to offer perks like full cost-of-attendance stipends and four-year guaranteed scholarships like the Pac-12.
The Power Five can submit legislation by Oct. 1 and have it enacted at the 2015 NCAA convention in January.  The measure will be sent back to the NCAA board of directors for further consideration if 75 schools not included in the autonomy ruling vote against it within 60 days, but NCAA Board Chairman Nathan Hatch, said he is “very confident that it will not be overridden.”
Haden said he is very happy about the NCAA granting autonomy because it allows for more benefits to student athletes, a cause for which he has long advocated.
“I’ve been arguing that we need to do more for these kids for years, and this is just the first step,” Haden told USC’s Ripsit blog. “It is great for student-athletes at USC. Some of the things that we have done already with the four-year scholarships and the new meal policy we have, we’ll just continue to do as much as we are allowed to do.”

Heading into the season with a new coach, a new system and a new attitude, the 2014 Trojan football team was picked to finish second in the Pac-12 South in the preseason media poll.

The Trojans are coming off of a 2013 season in which they won their first bowl game since 2009 — a 45-20 beatdown of the Fresno State Bulldogs in the Las Vegas Bowl last December. Their 10-4 campaign served as a rebound from USC’s disastrous 7-6 season in 2012 that culminated in a 21-7 loss to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl.
USC wound up in a second-place tie with UCLA in the Pac-12 South after being picked to finish third behind the Bruins and the Arizona State Sun Devils last year. The Trojans went 6-3 in conference play and 3-2 against Pac-12 South opponents.
This year, the Bruins were chosen to win the South for the second year in a row, tallying 37 first-place votes. The Trojans, meanwhile, received one first-place vote, as did the Sun Devils.
USC also received one vote to win the Pac-12 title game, which will be played at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara for the first time this December.
The Oregon Ducks were selected to win the Pac-12 for the second straight year, garnering 37 of 39 votes for the top spot, and are overwhelmingly favored to win the Pac-12 title game.
With all of the emphasis the fans and the media place on the preseason rankings, USC’s representatives at Pac-12 Football Media Day this year appeared blissfully unaware of their spot in the poll.
“I didn’t know that until now,”  said redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler when prompted about being chosen to finish behind UCLA.
The signal-caller was quick to praise the program across town and justify the teams’ rankings, though.
“They beat us the last two years, so that doesn’t surprise me that they’re ahead of us,” Kessler said. “You know, they’ve got a great team out there and [UCLA quarterback] Brett [Hundley]’s doing a great job with those guys.”
When junior defensive end Leonard Williams was caught off guard by a similar question, it became clear that the Trojans made a point not to focus on their ranking.
“Second?” Williams asked, then laughed. “Well everyone knows that ’SC has high expectations … so it’s kind of a downer to be the team that’s not the dominant one in the Pac-12 these past few years. But at the same time I like being the underdog and just coming from the bottom and showing everybody that they shouldn’t have ranked us low. We’re just gonna come out and be ready to play anybody.”
USC will have to be ready to play to have success in the Pac-12 this season. The Trojans’ 2014 schedule features trips to Stanford, Arizona, Utah, Washington State and UCLA, teams against which USC posted a 3-2 record at home last season.
USC’s 10-7 loss to the Cougars in the second game of last season was the first sign of the tumultuous year that was to come in Troy, and the 35-14 loss to the Bruins was USC’s first home loss to UCLA since 1997 and marked UCLA’s largest margin of victory over USC since 1970.
USC’s conference slate includes three teams ranked in the Amway Preseason Coaches poll: UCLA (No. 7), Stanford (No. 11) and Arizona State (No. 18). USC came in at No. 15 in the first poll of the year.
First-year head coach Steve Sarkisian acknowledged the difficulty of the Trojans’ Pac-12 schedule this season.
“UCLA, obviously, with Brett [Hundley] coming back is going to be a tough team to beat,” Sarkisian said. “Taylor Kelly at Arizona State, tough team to beat. The wide receivers at Arizona, tough team to beat. Utah, getting Travis Wilson back, going up there, tough team to beat. Here comes Colorado with their true freshmen. So it’s going to be very challenging every week in our conference.”
Missing from USC’s conference schedule for the second straight year are Oregon and Washington. These teams will reappear on the schedule in 2015 and 2016.
Though Trojan fans will not see the Ducks or the Huskies this year, they will see a brand new up-tempo offensive system under Sarkisian, who promises that it will be electrifying.
“We’re going to go fast, and that is something that will be very different than has ever been seen at the Coliseum,” Sarkisian said. “The schemes are going to look similar, but we are going to go fast. … Hopefully [it’s] a more exciting game for our fans, one that captivates them and keeps them into the game and utilizes the home-field advantage the Coliseum can give you.”
USC gets its first chance to show off its new up-tempo system at home against Fresno State on Saturday, Aug. 30, and Sarkisian said his team is going to be fully prepared to make a run for the Pac-12 title.
“We’ll play good football and be a well-conditioned team,” Sarkisian said. “We’ll be tough-minded. We’ll use sound schemes, and we’re going to play with amazing effort. Ultimately the ball has to bounce our way a couple times, but I think we’re going to have a good football team. We’ll see what happens.”

With more than half of the squad made up of freshmen, the reigning NCAA champion USC men’s water polo team will enter the 2014 season revamped and reloaded in pursuit of its seventh straight national championship.
Dripping with talent · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias will lead the Trojans into battle this year. The Athens, Greece native scored 79 goals last season, second only to since-graduated driver Nikola Vavic. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans battled the Pacific Tigers to the bitter end of last year’s NCAA finals, which saw then-senior driver Nikola Vavic  fire in a goal in overtime to lift the Trojans past the Tigers 12-11 and clinch the team’s sixth national title in as many years, finishing the season with a record of 28-4.
After the departure of multiple key players, head coach Jovan Vavic faces the challenge of molding his young team into another championship-caliber squad. While the Trojans will have to overcome the exit of the younger Vavic in particular, the elder Vavic is confident his new players can pick up where the graduated players left off.
“This is the youngest team we’ve ever had,” Coach Vavic said. “We’re going to miss Nikola, he has been a big part of our team for the past four years, but we move on. He has been great for us, now somebody’s going to fill in his shoes. … I think we have some really great young talent coming in that’s going to fill the role Nikola put in, but it’s always difficult to replace a player who’s so talented and so dominant.”
Freshmen, sophomores and redshirt freshmen make up 26 of the team’s 35 players; true freshmen make up 21. Driver Marc Vonderweidt, who will provide veteran leadership as one of the team’s four seniors, emphasized how much the new-look Trojans have clicked so far.
“We graduated a lot of guys but I don’t see that as being particularly an issue,” Vonderweidt said. “We have a lot of young guys coming in right now who are willing to step up and do their part on the team. From what I see right now the chemistry on the team couldn’t be better.”
Without his son, who netted a team-high 81 goals last year and set the USC record for most career goals all-time with 254 total scores, the 12-time National Coach of the Year will look often to senior driver Kostas Genidounias for offensive firepower and veteran leadership.
“We have [Genidounias], who’s an outstanding player, who the last three years has been carrying us offensively as well,” Vavic said. “He’s going to be arguably the best player in the country next year. He has done so much for us the last three years. Kostas is a warrior so I know he’s going to get his job done.”
No stranger when it comes to finding the net, Genidounias ranked just behind the younger Vavic in scoring last season with 79 goals and has built a reputation for coming through in big moments — Genidounias scored the game-winning goal against UCLA in the championship game two years ago.
Genidounias will bear the brunt on offense, yet he believes getting everyone involved will be integral to another successful defense of their title.
“Once [Vavic] graduated, the team knew that most of the defenses are going to approach our offense trying to shut me and some of our [other] offensive threats out,” Genidounias said. “All we’ve got to do is try to play with everybody in the game and try to beat our opponents with teamwork. … One player might make a difference in one game, but in order to win a championship, all players need to contribute, so that’s how we’re going to look at it.”
Though Genidounias could eclipse his former teammate Vavic’s scoring record in his final season, having tallied 178 goals through three years, he remains geared toward his team’s success, saying the record is “not as important as winning another championship.”
The team’s 2013 championship gave the Trojans the record for most consecutive national titles in collegiate water polo history, and Coach Vavic attributes it to his coaching staff’s ability to work with new players.
“I have a very good coaching staff, and it’s not one person — it’s a team,” Vavic said. “We really do a good job in developing the players. The key is recruiting. We really have to recruit the right people. Hopefully we did a good job this year again. If [the freshmen] do a good job, we’re going to be very successful again.”
Among the incoming freshman class, goalie McQuin Baron and utility man James Walters will look to be key additions for the Trojans. Both players hail from Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California.
Though the Trojans will lose standout goalie James Clark, they have added size in the cage in the 6-foot-9 freshman Baron, who has played for the U.S. National Team and was named 2013 CIF Division I Player of the Year.
“[Baron] is one of the — if not the — most talented goalies ever coming out of high school,” Coach Vavic said. “[Baron] is going to be an impact player immediately. He’s very quick, so it’s not just his size. He has a great athletic ability — I think he’s going to be the best goalie in the country right away.”
Walters has also played for U.S. National Team and earned All-CIF Division I First Team honors last year.
In addition to chasing another NCAA title, the Trojans will be playing with a bigger purpose this year: to honor the memory of Walters’ older brother and former Trojan two-meter Jon Walters, who died of a heart attack Jan. 8.
The elder Walters helped the team win their sixth consecutive title last year as a freshman. The late Walters also netted 17 goals last year for the team, with two of his goals coming in the NCAA Semifinals against St. Francis Brooklyn.
“We have a really close group of guys, and the tragedy we all endured was very, very, very tough,” Coach Vavic said. “We’re all going to play for Jon this year. We’re all going to do a little extra to honor him.”
