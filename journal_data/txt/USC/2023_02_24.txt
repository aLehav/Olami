Applications for many of USC’s various student organizations have closed. Now, you’re faced with the possibility of being rejected by those to which you applied. If you get into your top choices, congratulations! But don’t stress if not. Rejection is normal and not the end of the world. Nonetheless, it might still be hard to accept the outcome if it doesn’t go your way, so here are tips and tricks for dealing with rejection and the stress that follows it:
Give yourself a break.
Rejection is not the end all be all, and it won’t make or break your future. Learn to give yourself a break and not be harsh on yourself. Remember that you are doing enough already, such as balancing different aspects of your life: school, work, social life, family, health, etc. Don’t let rejection cause you too much stress; You shouldn’t be caught up in USC’s hustle culture.
It’s not you, it’s them. 
Getting rejected doesn’t mean you weren’t good enough. With so many great applicants, it’s impossible for organizations to accept everyone, especially when the acceptance rates are so low. At USC, there are clubs that are harder to get into than the college itself. According to the Daily Trojan’s past reports, USC student organization acceptance rates can be as low as 6%. When there is an influx of great applicants and the organization has such a low acceptance rate, it sometimes becomes almost like a lottery system. To sum it up, you’re not the problem; It’s them.
There are many paths to your goal. 
Not getting into a prestigious organization is not going to stop you from achieving great things. There is so much you can do to reach your goals, and rejection is just redirection. Many jobs value experience over prestige, and not being accepted into a certain club or internship isn’t a life-changing factor in your future. There are so many clubs and internships that can offer a meaningful experience, so don’t be too stressed and don’t be afraid to try again — or to try something new. 
Manage your stress. 
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help alleviate the anxiety that may come from rejection.
According to Healthline, regular physical activity can relieve symptoms of anxiety, depression and other common mental health conditions. Limit heavily processed foods and instead opt for nutrient-dense meals. Eating nutritious foods can help energize you and even make you physically and emotionally feel better. Lastly, and possibly most importantly, sleep more. Your body needs sleep, so don’t deprive yourself of it. 
According to the Sleep Foundation, “for people with sleep deprivation, insomnia, sleep apnea, or other conditions that prevent getting adequate rest, short-term daytime cognitive impairment is common. Multiple studies have linked poor sleep with longer-term cognitive decline, including the development of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia.”
Try to focus on other aspects of your life to forget the rejections and save yourself from the subsequent stress and anxiety. These decisions aren’t the end of the world. Have fun and stop worrying about the past. Instead, focus on your future and do activities that will empower you.

Assistant Opinion Editor 
When Americans today think of “counterculture,” we usually think of the 1960s — one of the most tumultuous decades in American history, characterized by a radical, rebellious spirit to fight injustice of all kinds, accompanied with an unflinching faith in change. Indeed, change was brought about in many forms: identity, social structure, family unit, sexuality and more. 
If college students in the ’60s were rebelling against war, materialism and any-and-all-things-establishment in search of greater liberation and individualism, what are the Gen Z college students of today fighting for or against? 
Following the fleeting success in the ’50s of the nuclear family model and the cult formed around it that banished the unmarried, the changes in social, economic and cultural conditions made ’60s counterculture all about the decentralization of family and an utter embrace of individualism, personal identity and self-expression — not too unlike the mainstream culture of today. Our everyday beliefs today lie on a line of direct lineage from the ideals that began to bud in the ’60s, and this fact is reflected in the most personal spaces of our lives, including love. 
A sociological study of women’s magazines by the sociologists Francesca Cancian and Steven Gordon found that from 1900 to 1979, love was seen as “self-sacrifice and compromise,” while in the ’60s and ’70s, it took on the form of “self-expression and individuality.” In the words of fellow Daily Trojan staff writer Gabby Anthony, “there’s no baby on board this generation,” as very few people in Gen Z think that marriage is about childbearing; Instead, we look to our romantic lives and marriage as another personal project, forever seeking self-discovery and personal growth, even in the bedroom.
Traditional family values have become so alienated from mainstream culture that Morgan Stanley, using Census Bureau historical data, predicted in 2019 that 45% of women aged 25 to 44 will be single by 2030. 
Following the disintegration of the social fabric that fell upon us at the same time as the dawn of modernity did that was seen in the late 90s, early 2000s, we now find ourselves in an age marked by rampant individualism, overburdened with academic responsibilities and further stretched by our self-perpetuated competing priorities between relationships and extracurriculars, all in the name of personal fulfillment and finding yourself. 
In short, we are living in a vacuum of allegiance, and as the last bit of remnants of our faith in institutions — such as big businesses, the media, justice systems, public schools and many branches of the federal government — erode, we feel lost, lonely and alienated. 
Our lives today are profoundly organized by Big Tech (as long as you live within the digital ecosystem of GAFA, or Google, Apple, Facebook andAmazon), and it’s nearly impossible not to be under their control if you want to have a functional life. While the counterculture of the late 20th century was to “be real” and more expressive of our self-identities, we mold our behaviors today according to the platform-enabled-hive-mind’s rules of social media, which, instead of suppressing our expression, forces us to express (well, at least it does if you want your friends and the world to remember you exist — it’s time to BeReal!). 
Personal expression is the most valuable form of currency in the age of social media. What cultural hegemonic logic is there to possibly be upended when the internet, which is all-encompassing in our lives, is a massively lucrative space of capitalization that cashes in on every amplification of emotions, user interaction and data cultivation? 
It is less that the social fabric has grown frayed as it has been manufactured and replaced by the digital and the artificial — a cheap throwaway fake that leaves us more lonely than ever. Combine this with the financial stress and general overcompetitiveness in the corporate and professional world today, and you have a society that is extremely burnt out, fatigued and just overall dissatisfied. 
There is now an anti-work ideology on the rise, notably on TikTok, ranging from the shameless “rich housewife is the goal” to the wholesome and candid confession of a TikTok user, @mjwritess: “I don’t want to be a girlboss. I don’t want to hustle … I simply want to live my life slowly and lay down in a bed of moss with my lover and enjoy the rest of my existence reading books, creating art and loving myself and the people in my life.”
Today’s counterculture is still a desire for liberation — liberation from the attention economy, from the atomization of society caused by excessive individualism and the loss of the real for the fake. True counterculture is difficult to see, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there. Nor is it torn apart. It is pallid and fretful, like mistaking a mirror for a window. But there is no society inside, online: It is only a semblance. Outside, in the real world, society hums along, where deeper and closer connections grow.

“Go back to the kitchen!” 
As a woman who plays video games — competitive shooter games, might I add — I’ve heard this nauseating phrase far too many times to count. Since I had my first taste of competitive gaming, I’ve faced my fair share of misogynists, xenophobes and plain old creeps. 
Despite the hours I’ve put into the game and my in-game rank, men still continue to put me down and hurl insults into my ear for simply being a woman. By all means, I’m not the best “Valorant” player to ever touch a keyboard and a mouse, but I know I’m not the worst player in the world. I know my own skills, and I’m aware when I’m having a bad day or not hitting the shots I should be hitting. 
But to yell at me when I’m doing better than you? That’s rich. 
I was playing “Valorant” alongside two of my friends, and I was having a good day. I was top fragging, getting critical kills and communicating clearly with my friends. The second I jumped to the top of the leaderboard, one of my teammates shouted into his mic, “Stop playing the game and go back to the kitchen, bitch.” 
I was in complete shock. I was carrying him and our team, and he had the audacity to yell at me and say that? I shook it off, but the harassment was relentless. “Make me a sandwich” and “you dishwasher” were among the insults hurled at me that I tried my best to ignore. My friends, being the decent people they are, stood up for me — but I still couldn’t shake off the destructive blow to my confidence. 
That’s when I realized that no matter how well you do in a game or how clear your comms are, women are always, always put down. No matter what. 
In competitive team shooter games, communication is essential. Deciding whether to default or rush, to save or full buy, identifying the locations of enemies and calling out for utility are all only accomplished through good comms. 
I know how important communication is to the success of a game, and everyone at my rank knows it too — so why do men choose to undermine winning a game just for the revolting satisfaction of upsetting a woman?
The second I speak into the mic, one of three situations will follow.
The first and most common one is “Oh my God, are you a girl?” or “Is that a girl or a squeaker?” Once they determine I’m a woman, it’s usually followed by, “Go back to the kitchen, bitch!” I’ve been called a dishwasher and professional sandwich-maker so many times that I’m unfazed by it. I’m not shocked, disappointed or angry. I’ve been so desensitized to it that I don’t feel anything. I simply mute the whole team and focus on my performance. 
The second one is “Add me to your friends list,” followed by constant harassment of “What’s your Instagram?” and “Do you stream on Twitch?” I absolutely hate this response. Sure, they’re not technically being misogynistic or sexist, but just because you’ve never touched a woman doesn’t mean I want to be your e-girl. You wouldn’t ask another dude for his Instagram the second he touches the mic, so why are you asking me?
The third situation — the best and rarest one — is no reaction or a normal response. When I comm, “Guys, let’s stack A, I’m pretty sure they’re going to try to hit it,” and I hear a reply, “Sounds good, I’ll drone out A main,” it’s music to my ears. I can’t even describe how happy I get when I speak into the mic and don’t get harassed or yelled at, and instead get treated like a normal human being — and this is honestly disappointing. 
Why do I get happy when I get treated like a man in video games? Why can’t women rely on the gaming community to be a safe space to improve their skills, grow as people and have fun? I will never understand why it’s so rare for men to treat women like normal human beings when it’s so easy. What sort of sick satisfaction do they receive from yelling insults at women over a virtual rank?
The constant harassment from men in competitive shooter games has made me avoid solo queuing at all costs. It’s sad that I’m only comfortable with playing competitive video games alongside my friends and my boyfriend, despite how much I enjoy it. 
I think I love games too much to ever stop playing, but, understandably, not everyone can withstand the never-ending hatred that seeps out of a 25-inch screen. A survey conducted by a market research firm, Bryter, found that 72% of women have experienced gaming toxicity, and 1 in 5 women online gamers quit entirely because of this toxicity.  
The gaming industry and community are dominated by men, but come on. We’re Gen Z and it’s 2023 — shouldn’t we try to change that? Women are not dishwashers or professional sandwich-makers. We vote, we learn, we work. We do everything a man can do — so why should that be any different in video games?
We want to freeze people in “Overwatch 2,” we want to click heads in “Valorant” and we want to play characters other than “Lux” in “League of Legends.” But we can’t do any of this if men keep putting us down for no reason other than who we are. 
To truly foster change, men need to stand up for the women being harassed. Don’t be a bystander when a toxic teammate is screaming at a woman. Don’t tell them to mute the jackass in-game. Stand up for them verbally, and tell them that it’s not right, even if you get called a disgusting name because, trust me, whatever name you get called is nothing compared to what women in gaming face daily. 
Rally with women in games, because I will not be going back to the kitchen. I’m comfortable right where I am.

The following review is based on an estimated 6 hours of gameplay.
On Feb. 8, a long-rumored remaster of “Metroid Prime” shadow-dropped onto the Nintendo Switch. The original game is considered one of the greatest of all time and was groundbreaking upon its release in 2002. “Metroid Prime” redefined a long-established series and combined its search-action design with new gameplay mechanics to make a “Metroid” fitting for a different gaming landscape and a brand new audience.
In 1986, Nintendo released the first “Metroid” game on the Famicom Disk System in Japan. This sci-fi, action-adventure game starred skilled hunter Samus Aran, who ventured to the planet “Zebes” to prevent Space Pirates from taking advantage of biological creatures known as “metroids” that could end all life in the galaxy. The series would receive two more entries before taking an eight year hiatus. In 2000, a brand-new Nintendo subsidiary called “Retro Studios” took on the task of adapting the franchise for a new era. The result was a first-person shooter: “Metroid Prime”. 
It has been over 20 years since “Prime” was first released, but does it still hold up when put against modern standards? The answer is both yes and no.
Prime’s gameplay infuses the play style of an FPS with the series’ usual toolkit and design philosophy. The beginning segment follows a classic game design trope of giving a player tons of tools at their disposal during a tutorial segment and then taking them away to set a goal for the player of getting them back. 
Samus starts her main journey solely equipped with the power beam on her arm cannon. The charge beam, missile launcher, morph ball and grapple beam all have to be regained by exploring the world, with several areas locked off until each tool is acquired. Further upgrades to the suit also exist, such as the wave beam and boost ball. The morph ball is easily the most fun of Samus’s toolkit; rolling around as a ball brings a childlike fun, especially when momentum, bombs and other upgrades are mixed in.
The controls in general are incredibly solid. Players can choose between the original GameCube scheme, a style reminiscent of Wii’s “Metroid Prime Trilogy,” a combination of the GameCube controls and motion aiming, or a brand new dual-stick setup that is reminiscent of most modern shooters. This new scheme is a massive upgrade from the original controls. The implementation of “Prime”’s lock-on function with the left trigger is beyond satisfying. It was used in the original to help players strafe while keeping track of enemies, but here, it makes hordes easier to navigate and gives each hit a good feeling. This is a game that keeps you on your toes, and the music and atmosphere give a sense of epic sci-fi energy the series is known for.
The overhaul in graphics helps to achieve this vibe and boosts it to new heights. “Prime Remastered” looks like a late Xbox 360 or early Xbox One game. While this may not sound groundbreaking when current-gen PS5 and Series system games can look like Pixar animations, for a game released 20 years ago, it looks incredibly modern. 
The lighting and shadows are clean, the water is beautiful and it runs at a solid 60 FPS in both TV and handheld mode. The resolution is only 900p and 600p, respectively, but that’s still an upgrade over the GameCube and Wii re-release’s 480p graphics. The game does look worse in handheld mode, as do most Switch titles, and the visor HUD took some getting used to, even on the larger Switch OLED’s screen.
“Metroid Prime”’s biggest flaws are in its backtracking and save system. There is as much magic in upgrading your suit and finding new opportunities as there is frustration from hauling it 20 minutes to unlock new sectors within locations you have already visited. 
Exploring the world and solving puzzles can be rewarding, but after a while, it becomes annoyingly easy to lose track of where to go next. If little progress is made for a certain amount of time, the game will give a hint of where to go on a map. However, it often just leads you to a room where another upgrade or boss fight will happen, rather than a hint of how to actually get closer to that room. Call it a skill issue, but running around aimlessly without anything new to do may be a turn-off for modern audiences, especially those with shorter attention spans.
The save system is also incredibly frustrating by modern standards. “Metroid Prime” uses the save point approach — instead of being able to save wherever you want, players have to find a room where they can stop and save their progress. This is not always a problem; however, these rooms are few and far between, often quite removed from a major event. A boss fight could be beaten with very little health left, and that moment of triumph can be swamped by a little bug on the way back to a save point, wiping out half an hour of progress. Losing a boss battle sends you all the way back to the save point, which can be very frustrating to just get back to. 
The game’s structure doesn’t lend itself well to the quick save concept (saving wherever you want) because it always wants you on your toes. But, at the very least, the frustrations of losing progress could be alleviated by placing save points closer to moments where the prospect of losing that progress is scarier than losing the battle itself, or just letting players restart key fights.
If players can put that aside and be patient in handling loads of backtracking and problem-solving, it’s a great game. It’s well-designed, fun to play and successful in achieving the anxious sci-fi energy “Metroid” is known for. It’s the definitive way to play “Prime,” with a better control scheme, lots of extras and a new coat of paint that puts it alongside modern titles better than other Nintendo re-releases like “Skyward Sword HD”. 
It is an old-style game just as it was in its original release. It carries the flaws of that decades-old system, but the freshness of the FPS-style format still makes it worth playing, even if there are some annoyances. Just be patient, remember the time it’s from and maybe keep a walkthrough on hand if you get lost.

Spencer St. Denis was riding his scooter out of Downey Way Parking Structure in Spring 2022 when he almost hit a student. If he had not hit his brakes in time, St. Denis said, many things would have changed in his life. 
Paulene Ng Chee, a junior majoring in communication, and Monique Chavez, a graduate student studying public relations and advertising, have seen many students getting into similar collisions on campus and developed “negative feelings of resentment” toward the issue. 
These students’ accounts of accidents on campus motivated them to pursue a larger mission at USC: A safety campaign to reduce pedestrian and mobility device collisions as part of ONE USC Safety Vision — an overarching view of safety on campus that is built on trust, inclusion, respect and belonging. The students created the campaign through a remote summer internship at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism that aimed to promote campus safety. 
“Maybe [students] don’t see or know the backstory behind [the campaign], but the sense that you can leave things better than you found it, I think that’s my message to all the students here.”
According to DPS reports, 157 traffic collisions occurred last year at the University Park Campus, with a majority of them involving e-scooters, skateboards, e-carts and bicycles. 
While the internship began during the summer and ended in September, the campaign was launched in the first week of the spring semester. The tagline, “We all deserve to get there,” aimed to encourage students to be more mindful about the safety of others around them. It’s necessary to shift students’ attitudes away from blaming others when collisions occur, Ng Chee said. 
“Our first reaction is to either get angry or claim that it’s not [our] fault … but whoever’s fault it is doesn’t really stop [collisions] from happening,” Ng Chee said. 
While the safety campaign is a part of ONE USC Safety Vision, it was important that the initiative had a student-led voice to create a message that resonated with the USC community, Ng Chee said.
“I don’t like arbitrary random people trying to tell me ‘this is what you’re supposed to be doing,’” Ng Chee said. “Instead, I wanted to encourage people to make the choice of [taking] a step back because it still gives [students] that kind of autonomy.”
Chavez took part in the design process of the campaign and said placing signs where accidents happen was beneficial for spreading the message to as many students as possible. 
“We were strategic in thinking about where we want to see signs on campus [and placed them] in those busy heavy traffic areas, near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and areas where there’s always a ton of traffic, pedestrians, bikes and other mobility devices,” Chavez said.
Ultimately, Ng Chee said the safety campaign values the collective efforts of the student body and aims to create an environment where individuals are encouraged, not mandated, to care for the well-being of others.
“We’re such a diverse campus that, sometimes, it’s easy to end up cornered into your little pocket,” Ng Chee said. “That kind of mindset doesn’t really help make sure everybody on campus is safe.” 
While the safety campaign signage has been removed, St. Denis hopes the team’s collective efforts to reduce pedestrian and mobility device collisions will spread a larger message that students should not view problems on campus as things they cannot control. Instead they should find ways to actively create change on campus because USC is more than willing to listen. 
“I hope the students are proud of the work that we’ve done,” St. Denis said. “Maybe they don’t see or know the backstory behind it, but the sense that you can leave things better than you found it, I think that’s my message to all the students here.”

The Tutor Campus Center offers several restaurants as alternatives to the dining halls: Burger Crush, Taco-Taco, C&G Juice, Filone’s, Panda Express, Slice Shop and Seeds. However, some students recall a time when the TCC lineup was different: Taco-Taco used to be Verde, Burger Crush used to be a Carl’s Jr. and Seeds Marketplace used to have a Lemonade.  As recently as last semester, The Kitchen — which had been open only for a year — was replaced by Filone’s Pasta Kitchen and Slice Shop. These changes in dining options have raised concerns about increased pricing and less variety among the student body. 
“I’m surprised to see how frequently things come in and out,” said Sophia Lee, a senior majoring in biological sciences. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Assistant Vice President of USC Hospitality Dirk De Jong said the changes were a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.  
“Because of the pandemic, many concept changes that were previously planned had to be delayed or adjusted due to the overall COVID-19 response of the University,” De Jong wrote. “This resulted in an unusual amount of concept changes this year to get us back to our goal of relaunching the Campus Center as a dining destination with a full variety of menu options.”
While TCC restaurants offer some vegetarian and vegan options, Shivi Anand, a freshman majoring in global geodesign, said these options are limited and that non-vegetarians have many more meals to choose from, especially at Seeds Marketplace. 
At a Feb. 16 tour of TCC restaurants with the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media, De Jong said providing options that are inclusive of a wider variety of diets is a “work in progress.” 
“If we don’t offer it ourselves, we make sure that we partner with somebody that can actually help us with that,” De Jong said.
USC Hospitality redeveloped its menu and choices offered when Verde was rebranded as Taco-Taco to better represent its modified menu with a bolder flavor profile influenced by Los Angeles taco stands, De Jong said. One student, however, thought the change took place to make the name more accessible to non-Spanish speaking students. 
“I personally don’t think the word verde, which means green in Spanish, is so hard for people to pronounce,” said Alyse Saucedo, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “Changing it to Taco-Taco was trying to make it more accessible for a certain population of people.”
Saucedo said she appreciates the new restaurants because the quality of food has improved. 
“I view the Italian restaurant change positively. It is better food and pasta is more versatile for everyone,” Saucedo said.
While USC Hospitality aims to provide value for money, these changes have impacted students’ pockets. Some students said they are unhappy because the current restaurants charge higher prices than the older ones. For example, a Single Crush Burger at Burger Crush costs $6.99, while a Famous Star with Cheese at Carl’s Jr., which was at USC until January 2014, currently costs $5.99.  
“They’ve raised their prices for the dining dollar stuff,” said Rachel Appenzeller, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering & computer science. “I used to get pasta from The Kitchen for less than $10 and it was a big serving that I couldn’t finish. I got it today from Filone’s and it was more than $10 and a smaller portion.”
The Kitchen, De Jong said, was always meant to be a temporary addition so that students on a meal plan would have more options and variety during the pandemic. The food court was crowded during the pandemic because of the limited options, he said, and The Kitchen was meant to provide an additional outlet and de-densify the campus. 
Sonya Kakodkar, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she wishes USC Hospitality would expand the eligibility of meal swipes to other joints at TCC, such as the make-your-own salad bar at Seeds and Panda Express. Panda Express, though located among the other TCC restaurants that accept meal swipes, does not accept the alternate paying option because of a license agreement, De Jong said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Meal swipes at TCC are exclusive to the Cardinal Plan, which gives students two swipes per week, and the Cardinal Flex Plan, which gives students 50 swipes per semester. Other meal plans, such as Community 25 and Community 50, allow students to use meal swipes only at dining halls, limiting students’ access to restaurants. 
Some students, including Appenzeller and Lee, have been accepting of changes to the TCC restaurants. 
“Some of the food items I do miss, but I do understand changing things up,” Appenzeller said.

The No. 13 USC men’s volleyball team looks to keep up their consistent tradition of beating Mountain Pacific Sports Federation rival and No. 9 ranked Stanford with two games on the slate this weekend between the Trojans and the Cardinal at Galen Center.
USC is 71-35 all time against Stanford, and 8-2 in their last 10 meetings. However, Stanford posts a strong record of 8-5 so far this season and is coming off of an upset victory over No. 7 Pepperdine that has everyone in a Cardinal uniform feeling good. 
The Trojans are coming off their toughest stretch of the season thus far, as they are in the midst of a four-game losing streak that sank their record from 6-2 to an even 6-6. All of the losses have come against ranked opponents, including UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Penn State, Ohio State and Grand Canyon (twice). Despite their struggles, the Trojans are remaining optimistic about their progression throughout the season. 
“How we stay positive, the answer is perspective,” Head Coach Jeff Nygaard said. 
One area of success that continues to give the Trojans that needed positive perspective is their play on the defensive side of the ball. 
“We do know that our block and defense is probably the cornerstone of what we’re doing,” Nygaard said. “We’re holding some pretty prolific offensive teams to way below what they normally do.” 
Knowing that they have one of the best block and defense units in the country with 110 total blocks on the season, ranking second in the MPSF, the Trojans have emphasized improvement in other aspects. 
“So can we take our focus off [defense] a little bit and put it more into these buckets? The answer to that is yes,” Nygaard said. “We need to probably serve more consistently, we need to have better height on our digs so our offense has more of a chance to establish, we need to come in and communicate more about what route’s we are doing in a transition opportunity … the guys are educated on all of it and now we’re just cranking through practice implementing it.” 
And speaking of cornerstones, freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein has continued to establish himself as one of the cornerstones of the offense. 
Through some of the Trojans’ offensive struggles, Klein has been the epitome of offensive success. He has logged double-digit point performances in 10 of the Trojans’ 12 matches and is leading the team with 4.14 points per set. Klein credited his teammates with helping him quickly ascend to a starting role. 
“All the guys on the team have been super welcoming and really helped me find my place on the court and also keep me in my place,” Klein said. 
Nygaard said he thinks Klein is just beginning to scratch the surface of his potential. 
“The good thing about having someone of his talent, character and caliber is that he grows efficiency, awareness, fluidity and calm,” Nygaard said. “He will see the windows of opportunity better [over time], he’ll be able to attack them more effectively and efficiently.”
Klein continues to strive for constant excellence and improvement to outpace opponents’ scouting reports. 
“Just because you tend to hit certain shots doesn’t mean you should stop hitting them because they’re going to know,” Klein said. “If you’re really that good with the shot, you should keep doing it and keep improving.” 
Many Trojan fans are excited to see Klein’s first crack at heated rival Stanford, and the matchup carries extra significance for Klein himself. 
“My grandpa went to Stanford, my dad, my aunt, my uncle, my other aunt, my other uncle and then three of my cousins went there,” Klein said. “One of them [senior forward James Keefe] plays Stanford basketball right now. Me and my grandpa [Trojan legend and former NFL tight end Bob Klein] are the only Trojans in the family. So, getting an opportunity to play against Stanford in L.A. is going to be a great opportunity for me.” 
Trojan fans who attend Sunday’s game will not only have the opportunity to see Klein renew a family rivalry, but the first 500 will  receive a free koozie and get autographs from the team following the match. 
The Trojans are excited to give back to fans who come out for the game. 
“It’s a privilege to represent this great university and everything the men’s volleyball program is and everything the athletic department is,” Nygaard said. “When the opportunity presents itself to stand in front and look people in the eye, shake their hands and just be a role model or an ambassador for your school, your brand, your program, yourself, then we welcome people in.”
The Trojans will face the Cardinal on Friday at 7 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m.

From New York Fashion Week to Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime performance in all-red exclusive Alaïa and Loewe garments, sports and fashion saw so much in the beginning of 2023. This week, though, I want to underline skiing — the winter sport that embraces quite a few layers of clothing.
Whenever I put on my winter jacket, wool beanie, heavy boots and tinted goggles, how I look often loses ground behind the urge to get on a lift and swoop down the white hills.
But that’s not the case for California-born Olympic gold medalist and luxury fashion model Eileen Gu.
“People always think that fashion and skiing are these two completely disparate entities … when in reality, the core aspects are actually very similar,” Gu said in an interview with CNN. 
Gu’s interaction with fashion traces way back to her childhood. Gu attended her first-ever fashion week event in Paris when she was 15 and has said the experience was “absolutely life-changing.” Not only was Gu captivated by the way art was put on the body, but also by the expressiveness and atmosphere of the fashion show. Much like competing for medals, Gu described sports and fashion as interconnected in the same interview. 
“Both are rooted in a sense of self-expression and creativity. Both require a lot of confidence, being able to perform under pressure, and being able to be yourself unapologetically,” Gu said.
The San Francisco native, who is currently a student at Stanford University, not only finds balance between handing in college essays and gearing up for the Olympics, but also prioritizes balance in her personal fashion style. Gu designates her way of dressing through a mixture “between masculine and feminine, between elegant and sporty, between playful and mature.”
Making her runway debut at the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2023 Fashion Show, Gu modeled a cropped vest top paired with a matching two-tiered ruffle skirt. A pair of metallic lace-up sneakers, a monogram handbag and a black leather belt secured around her waist completed Gu’s look.
Currently signed with IMG Models, Gu has worked with Louis Vuitton, Victoria’s Secret, Tiffany & Co., Swiss watchmaker IWC, Estée Lauder and many other brands in China. Yet, the 19-year-old’s fashion involvement extends further into her ski design. Apart from incorporating her signature, in 2022 Gu pitched the Chinese proverb “A Dragon Amongst People” in the shape of a dragon. This year, she plans to ski above a phoenix with “Eternal Flame” etched onto the edge of the sidewall, representing the Olympic flame.
“There are a lot of personal style elements I’ve put into my gear that mean a lot to me,” Gu said in an interview with ELLE. “Skiing and fashion feed into each other in that they’re both so personal and expressive, so the play of both is something that’s so fun for me.”
Although fashion on the slopes may not be as renowned as the NBA pregame tunnels, ski gear has been growing increasingly stylish over the past decades. From Princess Diana’s retro puffer jacket to Jackie Kennedy’s full-body red ski wear, fashion has always been a channel of personal narration atop snowy hills.
Looking back at the 1910s, ski apparel was dominated by wool. Men wore long jackets over wool trousers while women wore the same jackets over pants and knee-length skirts for warmth. 
In the 1940s and ’50s, the production of synthetic materials introduced by Eddie Bauer began to overtake wool in ski fashion. Those materials were made into looser tops but tighter trousers for elevated mobility. Legging-like pants in thicker material were the trend among skiers.
From the 1970s to the ’90s, bright colors, neon and color blocking styles raged as spandex ski outfits spiked in popularity. Fleece and the technology known as GORE-TEX were introduced during this time period. Materials that were lightweight, waterproof and kept the same warmth were frequently worn.
Ski outfit trends began to grow baggier at the beginning of the 2000s. Compared to the ’80s and ’90s, neon colors dimmed down and looser synthetic fleece layers were worn more often. Luxury brands such as Chanel, Christian Dior and Prada emphasized designing fashionable threads for both on and off the slopes. It became a trend for designers to blend the slopes and streets into one style.
Recently, more and more brands have released collaborations that make mountain dressing more fashionable. Canada Goose partnered with Reformation to display colorblocked and floral-patterned puffer jackets along with vests and scarves. DL 1961 collaborated with Perfect Moment, bringing denim to the slopes in one collection, including a houndstooth denim winter jacket and matching snow pants. Gucci Vault partnered with HEAD Sportswear, presenting a selection of ski suits, vests and accessories in street style at high altitudes.
Unlike the saying that fashion goes in cycles, I find ski fashion to hardly ever go out of style. Whether vintage or modern, ski fashion is especially expressive due to the color contrast when one dressed in neon speeds down a white hill. In my opinion, seeing a skier from afar is almost like witnessing an artist’s first streak of paint on a clean canvas.Being as expressive as ski fashion is, celebrity skiers such as Gu undoubtedly have a great influence on younger generations, as Gu closed out her interview with CNN by saying, “I just want to be the person that a girl at home can see on TV or on their phone and say, ‘Hey, you know, if she can do that, then I want to try it, too. She looks like she’s having fun. When can I try?’”
James Bao is a freshman writing about the interrelations between sports and fashion, as well as athletes’ identities, in his column, “Fashion Focus,” which runs every other Friday.

After a triumphant 2022 season that saw the Trojans capture the Pac-12 title and their second consecutive NCAA title, No. 4 beach volleyball will take to the court this weekend to kick off the new season.
“We’re super excited,” said junior Delaynie Maple, who started last season on court three. “I’ve never seen a group honestly work this hard. Girls are coming in, day in and day out, and putting in a ton of work, so I’m just excited to see everything put into place.”
The Trojan team that takes the court this season will look very different from the roster that secured both championship titles last season. Six of the 10 starters from last season are gone: Olympian Tina Graudina and All-American Hailey Harward from court one, All-American Sammy Slater from court two and 2021 All-American Julia Scoles who played with Maple on court three.
“We had a spectacular team the last couple of years. You know, I think that was the best team ever assembled in college [beach] volleyball,” said Head Coach Dain Blanton. “That’s the beauty of collegiate sports … we’ve got a lot of new players and so every rap and every touch is crucial to get younger players up to speed so that they can be as good as they can be.”
Joining Maple are the remaining starters from last year’s lineup: two-time All-American Megan Kraft, who started last season on court two, and two-time AVCA top-flight winners Audrey and Nicole Nourse, who started together last season on court four. 
“We had so many seniors last year that we were kind of able to take how each of them tried to lead the team and we saw what worked,” Maple said. “It was just implementing our team culture, the team standards we want and all the freshmen and the transfers have been like sponges. They’re taking every ounce of information in, which has been awesome.”
In addition to their returning starters, the Trojans drew in some big names during the transfer season. USC secured AVCA All-American graduate Madison Shields from Pepperdine, where she spent the entire season playing on court one. Along with Shields, USC was able to nab graduate Ashlyn Rasnick-Pope, who primarily played at court one for Louisiana State University in 2022 and senior Jenna Johnson, who transferred from Florida State where she played across courts two, three and four.
“We’re getting so many new components, so many new personalities which have been awesome,” Maple said. “Everyone’s super excited. Everyone I think has the right mindset and very, very excited to put a jersey back on.”
After a long off-season with nothing to do but train and wait, the Trojans are more than ready to put their new roster to the test.
“We’ve been training for so long, it’s going to be so nice to finally compete, and I know all the players are looking forward to that,” Blanton said. “We look at it as the season, not what we did years ago or whatever. How can we be the best version of ourselves this year, and I think we’re on track to do some damage.”
While the Trojans are proud of their success last season, they are not letting it influence their mindset as they enter this season.
“You have to remember that all of the pressure and the stress is pretty much made up in your own head,” Maple said. “It’s time to recreate another story, try and do our best to accomplish the goals we did last year. But try not to live in the past and make our own future with this team, which I think is going to be really exciting.”
The Trojans’ first challenge of the season will come this weekend as they host No. 6 Grand Canyon University and No. 14 Long Beach State this Friday.
“Grand Canyon and Long Beach have always been known to be really scrappy teams and really gritty teams and trying to get it done no matter what,” Blanton said. “They don’t play conventional, they’ll do some stuff and you’ve got to be ready for it … we’ve got to be ready for everything.”
The Trojans will kick off the season Friday at 12:15 p.m. at Merle Norman Stadium.
