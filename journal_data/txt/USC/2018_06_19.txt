As the dust settles on USC sports for the 2017-2018 year, student-athletes and coaches were selected for awards in their respective fields.
Caryl Smith Gilbert
Caryl Smith Gilbert was named the Coach of the Year by the United States Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. Smith Gilbert, who just concluded her fifth season at USC, led the Trojans to their first Pac-12 Championship in over 20 years and their first outdoor title since 2001, edging out second-place Georgia, which won the men’s championship, and third-place Stanford. The Pac-12 Coach of the Year’s players won eight of the 21 events at the NCAA championship as well as setting numerous USC records throughout the year.
Quincy Watts
Quincy Watts was awarded the Men’s Assistant Coach of the Year by the United States Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. Watts, who is in his fifth season on staff, is regarded as a Trojan legend himself, consistently ranked in the top 10 in the 400m during his time at USC. He also won a gold medal in the 1993 world championships. He was recognized this year for his work with Men’s Track Athlete of the Year Michael Norman, as well as for helping the team finish fourth at the NCAA championships.
Kerrigan Miller

While the men’s and women’s track and field team stacked awards at the end of their season, the women’s lacrosse team also had a player recognized for her on-field performance. Kerrigan Miller, a sophomore from New York was named to the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association All-America third team this year. After being heralded as the nation’s No. 1 recruit for the 2016-2017 class, Miller has lived up to lofty expectations thus far in her first two seasons. After leading the Trojans with 31 turnovers forced and a selection on the IWLCA All-West/Midwest Region Second Team in her first season, Miller improved by making the region’s First Team, and forced 40 turnovers, good for most on USC and in the Pac-12 Conference.
 
 
Michael Norman
Michael Norman, who just concluded his sophomore season, was named Men’s Track Athlete of the Year by the United States Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. After an injury freshman year that hampered his performance, the former National Gatorade Track Athlete of the Year exploded in his second season with USC. Like   Watts once did, Norman specialized in the 400m and with a time of 43.61 seconds. He now holds the collegiate record that was previously held by Texas A&M’s Fred Kerley. Norman was also a part of another record, this time in the 400m relay, where he teamed up with senior Ricky Morgan Jr., junior Rai Benjamin and freshman Zach Shinnick to post a blazing 2:59:00. Norman has since decided to forgo his eligibility and turn pro, although he will remain at USC to finish his undergraduate degree. Norman is also a semifinalist for the Bowerman, an honor awarded to the nation’s most outstanding track and field athlete. Along with fellow semifinalist Benjamin, Norman will look to become the first USC student-athlete to win the award.

On June 9, Kendall Ellis broke social media when she came from seemingly miles behind in the last leg of the women’s 4×400 race at the NCAA National Championship to bring home the victory for USC.

The video of the comeback went viral as fans listened to the announcers count out USC and declare Purdue the early winner. After bobbling the baton in the last handoff, it was going to be a hard finish for Ellis, who placed second in the 400 earlier in the meet, but with about 80 meters to go, her seemingly superhuman strength took over to surpass Oregon and Purdue for the win. 
Almost every major sports account tweeted the video which collected millions of likes and retweets, was replayed on ESPN through the following days, and even received attention from basketball legend Kobe Bryant. 
USC is no stranger to comebacks, but rather it is home to some of the greatest. Let’s backtrack from Ellis’ impressive feat and remember some of the best in Trojan history. 
USC vs. Penn State – football (2017)
This Rose Bowl game was as classic as Rose Bowl games get.  USC and Penn State entertained with a high-scoring battle up until the clock read  0:00. The first quarter went much in favor of USC, ending with a score of 13-0 and teasing Trojan fans with a cushion. Penn State ran up the score in the second quarter, but USC remained on top going into halftime. Right out of the locker room at the start of the third, the Nittany Lions quickly scored three touchdowns to startle USC and lead by 15. At the start of the fourth quarter, USC was down 35-49, but Sam Darnold’s solid passing for consecutive first downs drove the Trojans to a 49-49 tie. Matt Boermeester hit a 46-yard field goal with no time left on the clock to clinch the victory and end the highest scoring Rose Bowl game in history. 
USC vs. Stanford – women’s tennis (2012)
The match began with a USC win, but Stanford quickly tied it up 2-2. The Cardinals then began to dominate on three of the four courts, making it seem like the Women of Troy’s opportunity had slipped away. All at once but on three different courts, Gabriella DeSimone, Danielle Lao and Sabrina Santamaria battled in their respective three-set comebacks to ultimately defeat Stanford 5-2 in the NCAA Semifinals. They went down in history that day for beating Stanford in an NCAA tournament, a box that had remained unchecked for this USC team since 1983. 
USC vs. Oregon – men’s basketball (1999) 
USC trailed Oregon 79-84 with 2.8 seconds left in a regular season game. Off an inbound pass, Adam Spanich caught the ball behind the arc and made the shot to close the gap to 2 points. With 0.8 seconds left, Spanich intercepted the Ducks’ pass from the baseline, threw up a shot from half court and beat the buzzer, making one of the more improbable comebacks in college basketball history.
USC vs. Notre Dame – football (1974)
On November 30, 1974, Anthony Davis became a hero for all USC fans. The Trojans were trailing the Fighting Irish 6-24 at halftime, when head coach John McKay prophesied that Davis would return the kickoff for a touchdown, and he did just that for a 102-yard score. The Trojans then went on to score 49 points in 17 minutes and shut out Notre Dame in the second half. With four touchdowns from Davis, USC took the 55-24 victory and went on to win the national championship. 
USC vs. Minnesota – baseball (1973) 
The Men of Troy were in danger of a shut out as they entered the bottom of the ninth inning in the College World Series semifinal against Minnesota. They were trying to catch up from a 7-0 deficit against Minnesota pitcher Dave Winfield, who had struck out the Trojans 15 times. After Winfield sat, USC opened the inning with a base hit and followed with a grounder that turned into a double play. They then scored 8 runs in one of the greatest comebacks in College World Series history, beating Minnesota and going on to win it all.

Trevor Denton | Daily Trojan
Entering this year’s FIFA World Cup, I was apathetic — as were many Americans. Without the United States to root for, I had no dog in the fight. Even worse, I had no strong ties to any other country competing. 
But I’ve found myself exhilarated by the action so far in Russia, even without a clearcut team to support. The quality of offensive play is down from Brazil’s goal-fest four years ago, but the suspense and drama of each match has more than compensated for it. 
There’s an aura of unpredictability in this year’s tournament unseen in years past. The quadrennial favorites — Germany, France and Brazil — have all looked feeble in the group stage. Meanwhile, international soccer’s middle class has risen to the occasion. 
2014 was defined by the combined dominance and eventual clash of giants Brazil and Germany. Die Mannschaft ended up crushing the host nation 7-1 in the semifinals (because the soccer gods are soulless), before defeating Argentina to take home its fourth World Cup. 
In contrast, 2018 has been defined by parity. As of Monday, only three squads hold a goal differential of two or higher. Of the top five teams in FIFA’s current world rankings, only one — Belgium — has managed to grab three points in its first game. The other four have combined for zero wins, three ties and one loss. Not exactly inspiring stuff from the world’s supposed best.

Instead of the usual contenders running roughshod against the field, underdogs have taken over in the early group stage. 
First, there was Iceland’s shocking 1-1 draw with Lionel Messi’s Argentina. The World Cup’s equivalent of a 16-seed in the NCAA Tournament, Iceland was the darling of European qualifiers. The national team earned its first ever berth in the World Cup by going toe-to-toe with European stalwarts like Portugal and England. 
But the nation, which is roughly the size of Ohio, isn’t content with just being in Russia. Its unapologetically defensive game plan stifled the world’s greatest scorer in Messi to the tune of 0 goals on 11 shot attempts (there’s parking the bus and then there’s leaving the bus in the garage, which Iceland did). Late penalty and free kick misses by the Barcelona superstar punctuated a frustrating day at the office. Now Iceland and Argentina are tied behind Croatia in Group D, just as all the experts predicted it (exactly no one predicted it). 
Humble pie stayed on the menu Sunday, when America’s neighbor, Mexico, handed No. 1 ranked Germany (Germany!) a 1-0 defeat, triggering an artificial earthquake in Mexico City. Germany is now in danger of becoming the third-straight defending champion to get bounced out after group play. It marked its first opening loss in the World Cup since 1982. The Germans appear to be handling the loss super well, except for the fact that they cancelled media activities on Monday to avoid criticism, per ESPN. Yikes. 
Mexico still has a long way to go before reaching their ultimate goal —  navigating its way past the Round of 16 for the first time since 1986. Still, El Tri has every right to bask in its historic victory. 
American soccer legend Landon Donovan caught flak for appearing in a commercial urging U.S. fans to support arch-rival Mexico. His former teammates and fans of the men’s national team responded with a mix of bewilderment and anger.  I’m not sure why, to be quite honest. This Mexico team is everything an American fan could ask for — they’re gusty, they’re not defined by any one superstar and they are clearly equipped to take down giants. I’ll go back to rooting against the USMNT’s bitter rivals to the south when the U.S. is actually playing in the same tournament. 
Iceland and Mexico are the most prominent Cinderella stories of the World Cup so far, but they’re not alone. Switzerland used aggressive defense (and lots of fouls on Neymar) to contain Brazil in a 1-1 draw on Sunday. Meanwhile Russia stunned Saudi Arabia 5-0 in the Cup’s opening match, to the delight of their home crowd (including Vladimir Putin, who managed to keep his shirt on in the celebration). They entered the World Cup as the tournament’s lowest ranked team. 
In the early stages of group play, it’s impossible to tell where the World Cup goes from here. Even the top-flight Iberian matchup between Spain and Portugal failed to produce any clarity. The two traded blows back and forth like two heavyweight boxers in a prizefight. Ultimately, it ended with a 3-3 draw, and an early contender for match of the tournament. 
Regardless of what happens next, I now know I was wrong for thinking I needed the U.S. to be in the World Cup, in order for it to be interesting. The World Cup doesn’t need the U.S., just like it doesn’t need Italy, the Netherlands or even Germany. The soccer gods don’t play favorites.

A city practically bursting with vibrant culture, Los Angeles is an epicenter for the arts. While its most renowned museums boast sizeable collections and widespread name recognition, they are often overrun with visitors, overly commercialized and pricey compared to lesser-known alternatives. 
This summer may be the time to branch out with the plenitude of artistic and cultural hubs the city hosts: explore equally paramount but more arcane destinations for art. These three unassuming galleries are the perfect places to start. 
The Underground Museum
The Underground Museum, founded by Noah Davis, is an exhibition space committed to promoting African American art. (Photo from Facebook).
Founded by late artist Noah Davis, the Underground Museum was meant to challenge the rigid bureaucracy of the predominant gallery system and introduce world-class art to a neighborhood that traditionally lacked the proper resources and access to cultural spaces. In addition to showcasing cutting-edge African American art, inclusiveness and diversity are core to the museum’s mission.  
Today, Davis’ legacy is survived by his family and, per his original vision, they have transformed the Underground Museum into a community center of sorts — replete with yoga classes, a forum for artist talks and a spacious outdoor garden, fittingly called the Purple Garden to evoke a royal and luxurious atmosphere. In addition, the space attracts a dynamic circle of artists and intellectuals of color, including “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins and singer Beyoncé, reflecting a historic magnetism reminiscent of the Harlem Renaissance, and emphasizing the possibilities of bringing art spaces to locations other than the archetypal upper-class community.
L.A. Louver
Behind an inconspicuous black wall in Venice lies the entrance to the L.A. Louver gallery, a space committed to highlighting contemporary art from Los Angeles-based and international artists since 1975. Aside from representing works from 39 notable artists, including painter Ed Moses and sculptor Kenneth Price, L.A. Louver launched Rogue Wave in 2001, a program that exhibits artists living and working in Los Angeles to reflect on Southern California’s position as one of the world’s liveliest art scenes.
Few galleries manage to be as globally connected yet locally oriented as L.A. Louver, making this space a thoroughly unparalleled tour de force. From June 20 to Aug. 17, the gallery will present “EVOLVER,” an ever-changing exhibition of paintings and sculpture by over 50 artists who hail from different generations and backgrounds, clearly reflecting not only their own mission, but also the diverse stories that make up Southern California itself.
The Mistake Room
Physically, The Mistake Room is located in a renovated industrial warehouse at the southernmost edge of the Arts District but philosophically, the   gallery exists somewhere between an alternative art space and research institute. 
The gallery’s programs operate on curatorial cycles that are constantly being reimagined and adapted to address new questions, practices and themes, all with the common goal of helping patrons discover new ways of existing and learning through contemporary art and creative expression. 
The Mistake Room is singularly artist-centric as it allows collaborators to guide the direction of exhibitions and is an unwavering advocate of independent art spaces. Above all, the space believes in the value of making mistakes and actively seeks to create transformative moments that disrupt the status quo and provide glimpses of the future. In this way, the space becomes a transformative area not only for the art it houses, but also its visitors. 
True to its name, The Mistake Room’s identity and exhibitions are unapologetically bold, a testament to its twofold vocation and inspirational belief  in creative expression. 
Walking through The Mistake Room, one understands the power of mixing philosophy and art  as a third act in the process of existing.

Rating: 4/5 stars
Naturally in tune with today’s unannounced manner of music released, the Carters— Beyoncé and Jay-Z— released a surprise joint album this past weekend. The record, entitled “Everything is Love” is an accumulation of stories pertaining to the pair’s glorious rise to the top and the marital struggles that almost tore them apart. 
The record is a groundbreaking work that gracefully connects Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s musicalities, while also reminding listeners of their status as the top power couple in music. For the Carters, “Everything is Love” is a reconciliation of sorts — a third act following Beyoncé’s impassioned “Lemonade” and Jay-Z’s introspective “4:44” — that provides deeper insight into the couple’s public and private lives. 
It all began when the music video for the track “Apesh*t” dropped on Saturday. The Carters, as the album is officially credited to, shot the music video at the Louvre —  both a cultural milestone and a power play to flaunt their artistry and ranking.With the injection of black bodies and culture in a museum traditionally filled with Western art, the Carters engage in a fearless dance with the political status quo. 
The music video for “Apesh*t” is a tribute to the couple’s power as not only musicians, but also as cultural influencers. In one scene, Beyoncé stands in front of the Winged Victory of Samothrace, an Ancient Greek statue of the goddess Nike as she stands at the bow of a ship. Dazzling in an all-white dress, Beyoncé vigorously dances and raps, violently shaking her dress to mimic the flapping of wings. “I can’t believe we made it,” she sings, fusing the lyrics to the visual notion of Victory, “this is what we’re thankful for.” Her gratitude lingers on the word “we”— she is talking about their marriage, as well as their success. 
The nine-track record features many collaborators, including Pharrell Williams. (Photo courtesy of S.C Enterprises).
Still,  the record is built on its political undertones, which celebrates the astronomical success of two black people in a society posed against them.  
On “BLACK EFFECT,” Jay-Z raps, “Extra magazine hopped on a jet with my Ebony Chick/Blacker than the Essence fest,” while Beyoncé sings: “I pull up like the Freedom riders, hope out on Rodeo/stunt with your curls, your lips, Sarah Baartman hips.” Despite their portrayal of blackness and success, the pair is hyper-aware of what it means to be black. This is an awareness they are unafraid to share flamboyantly with their listeners. 
Although rest of the album’s visuals have not yet been released, its cover art deserves high praise. The artwork negates and redefines the Eurocentric standard of beauty. In front of the Mona Lisa stands two people who have historically been the opposite: a black woman thoughtfully combing a black man’s Afro. This juxtaposition is a reflection of the Carters’ success and their message of diversity and acceptance. 
Yet, underneath the grandiose portrayal of their success is the story of betrayal. The final reference to Jay-Z’s alleged infidelity is on the closer “LOVEHAPPY,” which commemorates the struggles they experienced to finally be “happy in love,” a marked change from their earlier declaration track, “Drunk in Love.” In a strikingly sober verse, Beyoncé sings, “But love is deeper than your pain and I believe that you can change.” The line comes across almost as justification: despite the legacy of women’s unjust subordination at the hands of men, Beyoncé once again introduces the notion of trust into her relationship. Moreso, she does it proudly. 
“Everything is Love” reinstates the Carters’ position as not only cultural icons, but also the faces of what America needs today: acceptance and celebration of different cultures, paired with trust and acceptance of each other. Each track reminds listeners of their accomplishments and victories. However, “Everything is Love” is much more than just that: the album is a representation of their legacy in music and contemporary culture. And while the Carters continue to shatter records and expectations, the world will be watching as always.

The movie stars Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, respectively. Photo from IMDb.
Rating: 4/4 stars
For 14 years, fans of Pixar’s “The Incredibles” have demanded director Brad Bird for a sequel. They have hoped — no, begged — for another epic adventure that the beloved family of superheroes will embark on to save the world from destruction. 
The long awaited “Incredibles 2” hit theaters last Friday in an era unlike that of its predecessor — now, superheroes are modern mythological icons, and this sequel already marks the fourth major superhero film that has been released this year. 
However, while another superhero film can often be overlooked, Bird’s “Incredibles 2” is a refreshing and unique take on the hero flicks that have dominated the box office in recent years. Complete with electric visuals and witty humor, the animated sequel shatters the expectations that once governed the superhero genre. 
Immediately following the events of the original film, the sequel transports the audience into the catastrophic bank robbery devised by The Underminer. While the Incredibles do their best to save the city from complete wreckage, the police officers are not happy. The year is 1962, and instead of entrusting superheroes with the selfless duty of crime-fighting, the government demands them to stay out of it. According to the law, superheroes leave behind more destruction than necessary and must resort to their secret identities.
Enter Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk), a multi-million telecommunications tycoon who wants to change the perception of superheroes with his tech-savvy sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener). As a die-hard superhero aficionado, Winston plans to redefine and legalize superheroes using technology. For Winston’s first step, Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), or Elastigirl, is shoved into fighting crime in the streets — saving a runaway train, using her super-stretching abilities to stop the Screenslaver, another major villain — all while having a surveillance camera installed in her suit that lends the public a proper glimpse into the life of a superhero. 
The plot then forks into two: Helen is taking on her new job as a superhero advocate, while Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson), or Mr. Incredible, is at home taking care of the kids. Turns out that parenting is a task easier said than done for Bob, with adolescent Violet (Sarah Vowell) dealing with boy drama, fifth-grader Dash (Huckleberry Milner) not understanding his math homework (perhaps a 1960s version of today’s Common Core) and seemingly harmless Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile) testing out his 17-or-so superpowers that were revealed at the end of the previous film.
While the improved computer animation welcomes audiences into a more saturated and fine-tuned world — viewers can count the hairs in Dash’s voluptuous ’do, and the cityscape is full of Pixar’s working magic — the villain’s storyline fell short to that of the original.  The character is not as compelling as Syndrome (the Mr. Incredible fanboy-turned-villain in the first film), who was more cunning, daunting and tragically flawed. The Screenslaver’s actions are not as dark and twisted as Syndrome’s operation Kronos, which killed underground, retired superheroes by luring them into fighting omniboid robots and eventually getting killed. 
As noted by Bird, “The Incredibles” left a shadow that was difficult to outshine with a sequel. Unlike any other superhero film, “The Incredibles” delves into family matters, a midlife crisis and a dismantling marriage that reeks of a possible affair. Even with the Avengers and (God forbid) Justice League, “The Incredibles” has continued to stand out with its complex, yet relatable storyline. 
While it was assumed that these characters would not develop drastically (the sequel does take place right after the original, after all), the family’s humor, the action sequences and a well-deserved Edna Mode appearance all wrapped into Michael Giacchino’s energetic soundtrack bring back plenty of nostalgia for viewers. 
The characters are still just as lovable or even more so than in the first film. Dash is still young and cocky, and Jack-Jack never fails to steal the hearts of viewers. Bob finally learns what it means to be a dad — even if that means getting the right kind of batteries — while Violet struggles with impressing her crush Tony Rydinger (who is arguably underrated as a side character), bringing viewers back to the horrors of middle school romance. 
Overall, the sequel seamlessly complements the original. “Incredibles 2” manages to stretch its world to one that is progressively bold, daring and, most of all, heroic. With its newest release, Pixar surmounts the superhero genre. And now, all there is left to do is to wait another 14 years for “Incredibles 3.”

The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative Research Lab released the findings of a study on Monday that examined whether or not the pool of today’s film critics reflect the movies they review.
The “Critic’s Choice?” study evaluated reviews of the 100 top grossing films of 2017, tallying the gender, race and ethnicity of critics. 
Upon assessing the reviews, which were extracted from Rotten Tomatoes, researchers found that the majority of the reviewers are white and male. The report found that an overwhelming 77.8 percent of those critiques originated from males. In addition, 63.9 percent of the reviews were written by white males. While female critics crafted a meager 22.2 percent of the studied reviews, only 4.1 percent came from underrepresented females. 
According to the founder and director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative Research Lab Stacy Smith, leaving out the voices of minority female critics renders movie evaluations unrepresentative and flawed. 
“This report reveals the absence of women of color working as reviewers — especially on movies built around female and underrepresented leads,” Smith said in a press release. “Creating inclusive hiring practices at every stage of the filmmaking and review process is essential to meeting business imperatives and ensuring that we see diverse perspectives reflected in society.” 
It was discovered that the majority of the film reviews from white male critics were also deemed the most valuable. Of the 3,359 reviews done by “Top Critics,” male critics dominated at 76 percent while their female counterparts wrote the remaining 24 percent — less than a quarter of the top viewed opinions. 
The study’s lead author Marc Choueiti also observed that white male reviewers’ voices were more pronounced than females and minorities. Top film reviewers outweighed underrepresented females by an estimated 27-to-1 ratio.
“Re-examining the definition of a top critic or simply casting a wider net can be the opportunity to open up and diversity the voices heard in the critic space,” Choueiti said. 
To mitigate the crisis, the researchers of the study proposed a set of target inclusion goals for film reviews. The 30/30/20/20 is one of the suggested methods that the researchers endorsed. 
According to the research report, 30/30/20/20 is a ratio that the pool of movie critics should align with to gain a more comprehensive and well-represented evaluation on new movie releases. 
“Current population statistics in the U.S. show a gender and race breakdown as being roughly 30 percent white males, 30 percent white females, 20 percent underrepresented males and 20 percent underrepresented females,” Choueiti said. “In the report we call upon aggregator sites professional organizations, educational institutions, and entertainment industry leaders to take practical steps toward inclusion of underrepresented groups in this field.”
Choueiti hopes that many players in front and behind the big screens are taking initiatives and speaking up to encourage awareness and female and underrepresented population participation in evaluating today’s increasing diverse films. 
“Notably, [actress] Brie Larson called for more underrepresented reviewers to be included as press for popular films and revealed at the Sundance Film Festival and TIFF are dedicating press credentials to underrepresented critics,” Choueiti said. 
Moving forward, Choueiti hopes to delve deeper into the nuances and implications of having a more diverse pool of critics for the movie industry and society at large. 
“We hope to answer additional questions in future research on this topic, such as the relationship between reviewer’s gender and race/ethnicity, and evaluation,” Choueiti said.

Despite being in the United States, several former and current USC students contacted different nonprofit organizations to buy water filters, new homes and eco-stoves for those affected by the natural disaster. (Photo courtesy of Gabriella Carrillo Lou)
Four USC alumni and two students have started a GoFundMe campaign to provide long-term aid for Guatemalans who were impacted by the Volcán de Fuego eruption in early June. The money raised from the campaign will be used to purchase 150 water filters from Ecofiltro and Aqus water filters, new homes from the Asociación Bendición de Dios and eco-stoves from the International Esperanza Project. 
The GoFundMe page received $15,385 in 15 days, a little over half of the students’ $30,000 goal. 
 According to the Los Angeles Times, the Volcán de Fuego eruption affected a total of 1.7 million people and left more than 3,000 displaced. 
“Right now, we need all the emergency aid we can get but in a couple of weeks, people are going to stop donating products such as bottles of water as much,” said Gabriela Bolaños, an alumna who helped create the fundraiser. 
According to the GoFundMe page, a team from Enlace AC Guatemala will distribute water filters to schools in Sacatepéquez, Alotenango and Escuintla, three locations in close proximity to the volcano. A team from the International Esperanza Project has already begun installing eco-stoves in the homes of those affected in Alotenango. The nonprofit organization Asociación Bendición de Dios will also begin constructing new homes.
“Because of my degree, I understood the importance of a long-term solution as opposed to temporary help,” said Bolaños, who received a bachelor’s degree in economics and non-governmental organizations and social change. 
  “Right now, I’m looking for organizations that are reliable, that are going to help the community re-establish itself in a more sustainable way and help them for the next year or so.”
Although the campaign is still in its infancy, several Guatemalan alumni made a recent trip to the country where they provided supplies such as food, clothing, mattresses and water to those affected. 
“I spent that entire first week after the eruption in a haze, splitting my time between volunteering to help out and scrolling endlessly through #VolcanDeFuego [on Twitter], crying as I read stories and saw pictures of what once was but never would be again,” alumna Miranda Mazariegos said. 
The remaining portion of their time was spent on coordinating with the previously mentioned organizations to develop a strategy for the provision of water filters, eco-stoves and housing. 
“Every person I know, from the poorest to the richest, is in the street helping,” alumna and co-creator Gabriella Carrillo Lou said. “The poorest people are giving all that they have to help those who were displaced, you see trucks of vegetables given to those displaced by people that are already poor. At the same time you see the company that makes mattresses for all Central America stopping production to make mattresses for the displaced.” 
According to Lou, the group realized that the best way to help from the United States was to raise funds and ensure the donations would be sent to Guatemala. In addition to their efforts, Lou stated that the Trojan Family has also been present everywhere during this time of crisis. 
Several USC students donated to the GoFundMe page, shared links on social media and showed concern for those who had family members near the affected areas. 
“We would like other USC students to take away that there are so many organization, platforms and opportunities at USC to be able to carry a project forward and make a difference,” Lou said. “There are plenty of opportunities and fellow Trojans to help you reach your cause, you just have to have initiative.”

Stan Ross, chairman emeritus of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, passed away June 10. He was 82. 
Ross grew up in the Bronx, and studied at  the City College of New York business school, now known as Baruch College. After graduating, Ross joined the U.S. Army. It was only after his service that he connected with Kenneth Leventhal, a pioneer in the world of real estate accounting in Los Angeles, where he was introduced to real estate. 
Starting in 1961, Ross and Leventhal worked together to build up the reputation of Kenneth Leventhal & Co., placing it as the ninth-largest accounting firm. Ross also advised companies such as Boise Cascade Co, Levitt & Sons and Singer Co. Ross eventually represented major real estate developers including A. Alfred Taubman and Donald Bren. 
Ross became chairman of the Lusk Center in 1999, where he helped develop an advisory board of real estate professionals, advanced real estate education and launched the Ross Minority Program, which indubitably serves as a strong marker of his legacy. 
USC Price School of Public Policy Dean Jack Knott emphasized how Ross “played a remarkable role in advising, teaching and mentoring our real estate students.”
“[It’s] devoted to investing in and revitalizing low-income, diverse communities, helps train people out of those communities in real estate skills and acknowledge about the kind of assets they have in their communities,” Knott said. “So that’s a passion for him over many years.”
Richard Green, director of the Lusk Center, attributed much of the center’s success to Ross.
“The Lusk Center was started in 1987, but not a whole lot was done with it,” Green said. “He was critical to the Lusk Center being what it is [today].”
Ross was a Distinguished Fellow at the USC Price school, and also a member of the USC Price Board of Councilors. The majority of his work and contributions focused on changing the real estate industry for the better — and that meant working to change the kinds of people who work in it.
“One of the problems with real estate is it’s a remarkably un-diverse industry,” Green said. “When you go to a conference of real estate developers, it is depressing how large the audience share is of white man. Stan had a vision of changing the business by developing a boot camp for real estate development that was specifically designed to get people of color who had some link to development — they could have been architects, they could have been designers, they could have been economic development people — in a taste of what the business is like.”
The Ross Minority Program has more than 700 alumni today. 
“Many of us connected to Lusk and Price benefitted from Stan’s mentorship and counsel,” Knott wrote in an email addressed to the USC Price Community last week. “In my time as Dean, Stan’s insight and recommendations have been incredibly valuable to me.”
Ross is survived by his wife, three daughters and twelve grandchildren. 
A memorial service took place June 12 at the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery.

For anyone looking to study Tagalog, Czech or any other language not commonly spoken, USC is not the place to look. While USC considers itself a world-class institution, its course catalog simply does not reflect the same priorities. 
The reality is that USC does not offer enough foreign languages, a critical component to cultural study and immersion — skills that widen students’ avenues of understanding and learning. Its lack of language offerings shows that USC disregards students who want to learn beyond what had been offered to them in previous schools or programs.
Universities with limited foreign language courses overlook the fact that language is often the gateway to learning more about a culture and understanding the ideas, practices and principles within them. Not everyone can study abroad and physically gain a global experience during their years in school. Even then, those who study abroad are sometimes held back by language barriers that prevent them from having a more rewarding experience. Furthermore, literature and art are better understood when one is familiar with the tendencies of another language — even authors who write primarily in English but are multilingual make stylistic choices better understood with knowledge of their language. 
Despite a high proportion of international students, USC’s language courses do not complement its wide demographic range. USC ranks second on the list of the top 10 universities with the highest number of enrolled international students, and has contended with New York University for the No. 1 spot in recent years. According to last year’s freshman class admissions profile, 14 percent of freshmen admitted were international students, with the most represented independent school as Shanghai Pinghe School in China. Nearly 25 percent of the University population is international students. With such a large pool of international students, it is surprising that USC does not offer the same diversity in its course catalog. 
The University’s language center offers 12 foreign language exams for students who may have studied a language prior to their studies at USC. Two of these languages are classical languages, Greek and Latin. In addition, Hebrew and Portuguese can be tested by departments outside of the Language Center. USC offers 13 foreign language courses, six more than that offered by the College Board. There are resources available to students who do want to learn languages beyond those offered, but these do not come with course credit or the structured curriculum that is necessary for some students.
A common argument is that plenty of students waive the language requirement, and universities should not be expected to offer much more than what high schools do. But this line of thinking completely overlooks students who do want to maintain the languages they know or have learned, or those want to learn new languages. There are also students enrolled in particular fields of study where language is important, but not  a required component of the curriculum. For example, international relations (global business) students are not required to learn a foreign language, but are highly encouraged to do so by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, as their area of study and future careers may involve communication outside of English. 
Compared to USC, UCLA offers over 40 different languages, including several that are no longer in use in the modern world — Ancient Greek, Medieval English, Old Irish, Old Norse, among others. While UCLA does have a larger student body, and perhaps higher numbers of students who want to study foreign language, its funding per student is stretched. USC is far from competitive in terms of its course offerings, but likely has the resources to become so. When considering course expansion, there is always the barrier of funding and staffing — but these issues cannot be resolved without discourse about them. 
The choice of which languages to offer is another challenge, and narrowing them down by speaking population or usefulness can be close to impossible. The best way for USC to begin expanding its language programs is for the University to gauge student interest democratically, or through a public forum. However, this is also consideration for a later time, if USC looks to increase the number of language courses offered.
USC’s mission statement says that it is  “a global institution in a global center, attracting more international students over the years than any other American university.” In terms of student demographics, this statement is accurate; but with respect to its foreign language offerings, USC fails to deliver. A university committed to cultivating expansive thinking, globally minded students should start at the foundations. Language is, after all, fundamental to all human understanding.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last Thursday, the University of Chicago announced that it would drop the requirement for high school students to submit SAT or ACT scores on their applications. While de-emphasizing standardized test performance has recently become a trend in higher education, this is the first time a top research university has completely waived the exam requirement.
And it couldn’t have come a moment too soon. While tests like the SAT and ACT should theoretically serve as useful points of comparison between different applicants, the reality is that these exams are not reliable indicators of student success — and can even hinder diversity on campus.
Debates over the fairness of these exams are nothing new. In particular, the College Board has long been criticized for including obscure concepts in its SAT — most notably in the vocabulary section. In turn, eager parents began to hire personal tutors to help their children “prepare” — or, in other words, memorize — the test. This was anything but fair for students who could not afford a $2000 tutor to help them with a three-hour test.
As a result, the College Board revamped the format of the SAT in 2016 to include content that was more relevant to what students were learning in school. And for the most part, it did: The reading and writing sections became less memorization-based and more evidence-based, and the dreaded 20-minute essay became optional. The College Board even made official SAT prep free through Khan Academy. 
And while these are all respectable decisions, companies like The College Board still make a profit from pushing out annual study guides. Independent test prep businesses still make a profit from telling kids their exam secrets can boost scores by hundreds of points. Indeed, it still rings true that SAT and ACT scores may measure how well a student can take a test, rather than measuring actual ability.
Economic factors aside, standardized tests may hurt racial diversity as well. According to a 2010 study by the Harvard Education Review, the SAT and ACT may contain implicit biases against minorities. Among the study’s most notable findings was that white students and black students of highly similar educational backgrounds had disparate scores on the verbal section, with white test-takers performing significantly better on the “easier” questions. And it makes sense: Some critics attribute this to the fact that tests written in a white-dominated society will contain expressions that white students are likely to have grown up hearing.
On the international scale, the SAT and ACT also pose unnecessary obstacles for students looking to apply to American colleges. On top of having to deal with the already lowered rates of acceptance for international applicants, overseas students had half the opportunities to take the SAT (four) when compared to their U.S. counterparts (eight) in 2017. While this indicates a failure by the College Board to give students equal opportunities to use its services, this shortcoming also points toward a larger trend of prioritizing U.S. students on campuses that claim to champion multicultural diversity.
For these reasons, the University of Chicago’s decision to completely do away with SAT and ACT scores was a smart one. According to The New York Times, the University of Chicago is not as diverse as it seems: Economically, the median family income of a student at the university is $134,500, and 58 percent come from the top 20 percent. Along with waiving the test requirement, the University of Chicago has also attempted to play “diversity catch-up” by offering full-tuition scholarships to families earning less than $125,000, as well as scholarships of $20,000 to all first-generation students.
As USC attempts to shake off its reputation as the “University of Spoiled Children” and become a more inclusive campus, it wouldn’t be outrageous to at least consider the University of Chicago’s application revamp. Not only would eliminating the test requirement be fair to the University’s growing population of minorities and first generation students, but it also wouldn’t make an impact on academic performance: In a 2014 report, the National Association for College Admission Counseling found no difference in college graduation rates for students who did not submit their test scores. 
While it may take time for universities to completely eliminate SAT and ACT scores from consideration, the University of Chicago’s unexpected decision points toward a more diverse future on college campuses. Hopefully, this future will come sooner rather than later.
