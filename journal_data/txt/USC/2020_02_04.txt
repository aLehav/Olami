The USC men’s golf team will depart for Waikoloa, Hawaii, to compete Thursday in the Amer Ari Invitational at Waikoloa King’s Course. The Trojans will face off against No. 3 Georgia Tech, No. 6 Pepperdine, No. 21 Auburn and No. 25 Texas, among a host of other opponents.
USC entered the season with high expectations but has struggled to live up to them so far, having slipped to No. 43 nationally after a preseason No. 11 ranking. The descent in the rankings comes after several disappointing fall performances in a number of tournaments and head-to-head competitions. 
“I’ve been doing this for a while, and, by the looks of our team, I think we have a chance to be pretty good,” USC head coach Chris Zambri said. “We just didn’t show it in the fall.” 
However, it appears that the Trojans may be trending upward at precisely the right time. 
The upcoming Amer Ari Invitational comes on the heels of an impressive third place finish at the Southwestern Invitational last week. The Trojans’ effort was led by performances from freshman Yuxin Lin, juniors Leon D’Souza and Issei Tanabe and senior Kyle Suppa. With the exception of Lin, each finished at or under par. 
D’Souza nearly finished the tournament with the best individual scorecard, but a costly bogey on the 17th hole in his final round resulted in a second place finish for the talented junior. 
“Leon did a great job all week,” Zambri said. “He had just about a perfect week. He’s already shown that he knows how to win golf tournaments.” 
D’Souza sounded optimistic about the team’s chances heading into the Invitational. 
“We can take a lot of positives from [this finish] knowing that if we do play our best we’re definitely going to be at the top or near the top,” D’Souza said.
The trio of D’Souza, Lin and Tanabe will likely lead USC in Waikoloa. But if the Trojans hope to improve their national standing at the invitational, they will need stellar play from the rest of the lineup as well.
“I think our goals should be high even though the fall was kind of mediocre,” Zambri said. “With [who] we have in our lineup and what each guy has shown when they’re at their best, I don’t see a reason why we can’t contend to win a national championship this year.” 
Outside of the trio, USC will rely on junior Kaito Onishi, who’s returning from a neck injury, and freshman Tyler Guo to perform at their highest level in Waikoloa. If previous results are any indicator, they are certainly capable of taking on the challenge. 
Onishi was given All-American honors last season after being named the 2018 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and a 2019 All-Pac-12 first teamer and Guo is full of potential as he continues his first Division I collegiate campaign. 
Zambri confirmed Tuesday that Lin, D’Souza, Tanabe and Onishi will be in the starting lineup at the invitational. Zambri said he is still deciding whether to give the last spot on the lineup to Suppa or Guo. The pair will be notified of his decision on Wednesday. 
The Amer Ari Invitational tournament begins Wednesday and concludes Saturday.

The USC women’s lacrosse team will start its 2020 season this weekend with a trip to the East Coast to face Hofstra. The defending Pac-12 champions were voted the preseason No. 16 by the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association and ranked No. 10 by Nike/U.S. Lacrosse. The Trojans were also voted first in the Pac-12 preseason poll. 
USC is coming off a 16-4 season during which it finished 9-1 in Pac-12 play and lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. A majority of the Trojans’ offensive firepower from last season will be back this year, with nine of their top 10 goal-scorers — who accounted for all but 31 of the team’s 272 goals last season — returning.   
Highlighting that group are junior midfielder Kelsey Huff and senior attack Izzy McMahon. The pair led USC in scoring last season and combined for 78 goals, good for the No. 32 overall offense in the nation. 
Still, USC head coach Lindsey Munday isn’t sure that her scorers have been getting enough attention. 
“We’ve been a defensive-minded team,” Munday said in an interview with US Lacrosse Magazine last week. “But hopefully the midfield and offense is where people will notice us this year.” 
Earlier this offseason, junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller was featured by Nike on the NCAA preview cover of Women’s Lacrosse Magazine. Miller scored only 22 goals on the season but finished with numerous career highs in ground balls (52) and forced turnovers (41). Kerrigan will likely be in the conversation for the Tewaaraton award this Spring, which is given to the most valuable player in women’s college lacrosse. Kerrigan was a nominee a season ago. 
USC’s midfield will also be bolstered by Huff and her sister, senior midfielder Kaeli Huff. According to Munday, the Trojans will have one of the most balanced midfield units in the NCAA.
“Our midfield has been strong with Kerrigan, Kelsey and Kaeli [Huff],” Munday said in an interview with US Lacrosse. “The midfield has been pretty strong for us, both on the defensive end and then on the offensive side.” 
Coming off a Pac-12 Championship, Munday’s Trojans are looking to stay motivated as they try to repeat last season’s success. 
For McMahon, it’s not hard to stay motivated with so much potential on the team. 
“I think we are all pretty motivated,” McMahon said. “This year we have 12 seniors, a lot of returners and a good new incoming class, so the motivation part comes easy for us just because we’re coming off of being Pac-12 champs — and also, it’s our last year to do what we gotta do.”
Despite all the experience and talent in this year’s group, McMahon believes the team’s strength will lie in something more intangible than strength or speed: chemistry.
“I honestly think it’s our team chemistry,” McMahon said. “Last year we came off a great year and we came up short, and I think with the way we ended — even though it wasn’t what we wanted — it helped us build our camaraderie.”
Munday drew parallels between her team and the 2016 Trojan squad that made it to the NCAA quarterfinals, losing only one game all season.  
“This is probably the closest team that we’ve had in the past three years — at least,” Munday said. “It kind of reminds me of the 2016 seniors that we had. They have really high hopes and high goals.” 
As USC prepares to open the season against Hofstra at 2 p.m. Saturday, McMahon believes her team just needs to keep the focus on themselves.
“Just play USC lacrosse,” she said. “Obviously, we are going somewhere that’s a little bit colder [in] the East Coast, [but] that’s where [a lot of us] are from and we are excited to see our families — but our main focus is just us.”

In the 1980s, Public Enemy told us to “Fight The Power” and N.W.A. said, “Fuck tha Police.” The two songs are among many protest anthems that have placed rap music at the forefront of social justice causes across the globe.  
In 2011, Jay-Z told us, “I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died/ Uh, real n*ggas just multiply.” But did they? 
The line attempts to draw a parallel between Jay and the assassinated Black Panther. Despite this couplet and the similarity it attempts to elicit, the rapper has continued to betray grassroots movements and people fighting for social equality in favor of shallow and capitalistic activism efforts.
For context, the NFL announced a partnership with Roc Nation in August. The entertainment company founded by Jay-Z will take charge of selecting artists for prominent NFL performances like the Super Bowl. The partnership also gave hip-hop’s first billionaire a stake in the NFL’s “Inspire Change” initiative relating to education and economic advancement, police and community relations, as well as criminal justice reform.
Yes, you read that right. The same league that blackballed former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to call attention to issues of racial inequality and police brutality is in business with the rapper who formerly stood in solidarity with Kaepernick by wearing his jersey on Saturday Night Live. 
But this is old news. Ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl, two ads produced by the NFL’s Jay-Z-backed “Inspire Change” initiative populated social media. One touched on the death of Botham Jean, who was killed in his apartment by trespassing Dallas police officer Amber Guyger. The other featured retired NFL player Anquan Boldin, whose cousin Corey Jones was murdered in an officer-involved shooting. 
The ads are heartfelt and might even evoke tears. That is the extent of their effectiveness. 
They’re cheap in the way that they use Black pain as a method to convince viewers, specifically white viewers, to care about the state-sanctioned murder of Black people. It’s been happening since around 1619, the advent of  American slavery, and we still see it on the news today. If they don’t care by now, there is not much an NFL commercial can do. 
Furthermore, they fail to mention the names of the officers involved. Their call for action is vague and they do not hold our criminal justice system accountable for these recurring murders.
Essentially, Jay-Z, the “Inspire Change” campaign and the NFL watered down Kaepernick’s message while excluding him from the league’s efforts to address social issues. 
What instantly comes to mind is Jay’s cheeky comment: “I think we’ve moved past kneeling. I think it’s time to go into actionable items.” And in a recent interview with The New York Times, he says, “Someone needs to say, ‘What do we do now — because people are still dying?’” when explaining his choice to partner with the league in “support” of Kaepernick’s cause. 
Commercials lacking calls for accountability are not actionable items. Using Roc Nation’s artists Meek Mill, Rapsody and Meghan Trainor as “Inspire Change” advocates is also not an actionable item that will end police brutality.
Yes, Jay-Z’s partnership with the league will bring the NFL to donate $100 million over the next 10 years on social justice outreach and causes. However, their charity means nothing when the man who initially inspired change, Colin Kaepernick, is still shut out and wasn’t consulted in the new initiative. 
What is an actionable item then? One example is Know Your Rights Camp, the free campaign founded by Kaepernick, to advance the liberation and well-being of Black and brown communities. 
An actionable item is spending your Super Bowl Sunday touring Black cultural institutions, handing out free meals and helping men get fitted for free suits; which is what Kaepernick did this weekend. 
I think it’s safe to say Fred Hampton, socialist and former deputy chairman of the Black Panther Party, would scoff at the parallel Jay paints between the two. And although imperfect in their own right, members of Public Enemy and N.W.A. would view the rapper as siding with oppressive powers as opposed to fighting them.
Hampton once said, “We say you don’t fight racism with racism. We’re gonna fight racism with solidarity. We say you don’t fight capitalism with no Black capitalism; you fight capitalism with socialism.” 
Jay-Z failed to stand in solidarity with Kaepernick. That could’ve been done by using his money, star power and artists to support and elevate the initiatives Kaepernick is already involved in. 
And what makes his 2011 “Murder to Excellence” lyric even more hollow is the rapper’s evident pursuit of Black capitalism as a means to uplift Black and brown communities. In the same New York Times article, Roc Nation’s mission is described as “representing artists and athletes is to make money change hands with a purpose. Roc Nation sees this as a social justice function.” 
And you guessed it, there is an “Inspire Change” apparel line as well as a “Songs of the Season” initiative where songs will be produced for NFL programming with proceeds going to fund the “Inspire Change” initiative.
Although Roc Nation’s efforts to economically inspire their artists and the “Inspire Change” funds approach activism differently, they don’t align with Hampton’s ideology and further characterize Jay’s social justice efforts as capitalist, not aligning with or directly serving the everyday people affected by systemic racism and injustice. 
Jay-Z’s involvement with the NFL is not the extent of his social justice efforts. He’s fought relentlessly for rapper Meek Mill’s release and co-created the Reform Alliance to overhaul the probation system, but it is his most notable and most criticized humanitarian endeavor.  
It’s silly to blatantly compare Jay-Z’s efforts with those of Hampton. Few of us, though we may try, will live and die dedicated to liberating our people. But as I’ve discussed before, in my first Everything But The Song iteration, “celebrities must be more conscious about their activism.” They can’t pimp the spirit of prominent activists and community leaders while turning their backs on modern-day people doing the same work.  
“I am a revolutionary,” Hampton said. “And you’re going to have to keep on saying that. You’re going to have to say that I am a proletariat, I am the people.” 
Jay-Z’s partnership with the NFL is not for the people.

USC is filled with musical talent. It’s impossible to tap through Instagram stories without being bombarded with new singles, covers and promotional content from fellow Trojans. And it’s no secret that a lot of that talent comes from Thornton, which boasts an alumni network with the likes of indie-pop darling King Princess. But what if USC’s next favorite student artist was studying ethics and political theory?
Stephenie Lawrence, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law better known by her stage name Vietta, is a singer-songwriter from San Antonio, Texas. Lawrence describes her music as chill alternative-pop that takes lyrical inspiration from artists with a darker tone such as Lana Del Rey.
Lawrence said she started writing songs when she was in third grade, finding that the process came naturally to her. 
“It’s an outlet for my emotions and a way to put my feelings into words,” she said. “Usually it’s like an emotional outburst … and it just comes out.”
Her song “Loveher’’ is a deeply emotive track about the desperation of a love triangle. Its R&B chord progression, top-notch production and composition highlight just how catchy and powerful Lawrence’s songwriting is. Some of her heaviest lyrics include, “Your words write melodies in my mind,” on “Loveher’’ and “I’m a body and I don’t have a mind,” on the track “Boy.”
Despite the gravitas of her emotional ballads, Lawrence’s music also has a lighter side.
Her most recent single “Dizzy” begins with her joking, “I kinda like you … haha, J.K. … Unless?” before it quickly unfolds into an upbeat pop track complete with plucky synths, saccharine vocals, acoustic guitars and an infectious hook. Lawrence said she wrote the song about an old crush.
“We literally hung out less than five times and didn’t even communicate that much,” Lawrence said. “But I wrote eight songs about him.”
Lawrence worked on the songs with her producer Nathan Chandra, an alumnus who majored in jazz studies before graduating in May 2019. Chandra produces music under the pseudonym Ox the Moron. The two met at an open mic night while at USC, Chandra said.
“I heard her on stage just soundchecking, and I was like ‘Holy sh-t’,” Chandra said. After the soundcheck, he asked if he could produce for her and she agreed.
Chandra said he enjoys collaborating with Lawrence and that the most fun part about working with her is when she shows him a new song.
“I’ll ask to hear it, and then she starts singing,” Chandra said. “And then I’ll just pick up the guitar or get on the piano or something and I’ll just follow along. In that moment the song kind of comes together in one take.”
Although Lawrence doesn’t produce, she brings a strong sense of artistic intention with her to every session, wanting the aural atmosphere of her songs to compliment her storytelling, Chandra said.
“Stephenie has really clear ideas of who she is musically,” he said. “It’s really fun to work with an artist like that because there’s no pretense. There’s no, ‘We need to sound like this.’ It’s just like let’s make this music that means a lot to me.”
Milagros Orozco Valencia, a student at Natomas High School and fan of Lawrence’s music, met her through Chandra. Valencia said Lawrence’s music and lyrics have resonated with her.
“[When I first heard “Dizzy”] I was kind of having my own relationship issues at the time,” Valencia said. “I just kept listening to more of her music from then on, and every song kind of spoke to me in some way.”
While Lawrence will headline a show Thursday night at Adult’s Only Bar on Sunset Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, in the future, she hopes to go on tour and play to larger crowds.
“I want to be able to be a great performer … but also create an experience,” Lawrence said. Lawrence hopes to one day emulate the theatrical live performances of artists Halsey and Melanie Martinez. 
“During her tour, [Halsey] incorporated theatre into it, and I thought that was really cool,” she said, referencing the Shakespearean performances of her album “hopeless fountain kingdom.” “She did like a ‘Romeo and Juliet’ type inspiration thing.”
Ultimately, Lawrence hopes for her music to comfort listeners. 
“I want my music to be transformative,” Lawrence said. “I feel like sometimes when I listen to music it helps me through things, and I hope to do the same for [other people].”

Elections run on a myth of “May the best man win.” Democracy embraces the idea that the best candidate — or the one who represents the people’s values — will prevail. In reality, the winner is typically the highest bidder; nine of 10 seats in the House of Representatives are filled by the candidate who spent more on their campaign. In almost every election — at any level of politics — money wins.  
And the cost of running for president is rocketing skyward. Winning candidates’ spending nearly quadrupled between 2000 and 2012, and the current election is gearing up to be the most expensive in history. With fewer people being able to afford to run a campaign, the ledge to become a serious candidate is rising. 
More and more, the panel of candidates skews to accommodate the independently wealthy, who can afford to spend private fortunes on their campaign. Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton spent $1.4 million in 2016, while Donald Trump spent $66 million of his own money to win. 
Where does this leave the candidates who don’t share those resources? For some, the only option is to drop out. When Sen. Kamala Harris exited the race in December, one of the main reasons she cited was that her campaign didn’t have the funds to continue. 
Others are forced to call on supporters to bankroll their campaigns. Fundraising is a staple of politics, but it can disproportionately benefit the candidates who represent elite interests. A single billionaire can provide more funds than a million working class supporters — Sen. Bernie Sanders’ average donation is just $18. If you’re a candidate hemorrhaging money to stay in the running, whose support would you court? 
And while qualified individuals are priced out of running, there are candidates like billionaire Michael Bloomberg who budged his way into the election by sheer buying power alone. He has already spent $200 million on his campaign, most of it going to an incredible advertising onslaught over TV and online media. So far, Bloomberg’s $60 billion budget has bought him a fourth-place standing among the democratic candidates.
Right now, the candidates are blowing through their cash reserves in the lead-up to the primary, and a large determinant of their performance will be the amount they’re able to spend. Whichever candidate wins the nomination will then have to start fundraising to match pace with the immense spending already underway by the President Trump camp. The committees working toward his reelection have been fundraising since the first day of his presidency — and they have raised a record-breaking $736 million in that time. 
In the coming year, that money will go to endless attack ads, and teams upon teams of political consultants. The Democratic nominee will have to scramble to catch up to Trump’s financial head start, and the general election will devolve into a spending battle between two massive war chests. 
A spending cap on campaigns may alleviate some of these problems, allowing a wider and less wealthy field of candidates to take the stage. While money and politics may never be completely separated, the cash supremacy in elections devalues their democratic ideals. We shouldn’t have to pay to keep our preferred candidate on the ballot, and the office of president shouldn’t be for purchase.

In recent weeks, the disturbing trend of outright xenophobia accompanying the spread of the coronavirus has been made apparent. In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter in the past week. In Singapore, thousands of residents have signed a petition calling on the Singaporean government to impose a ban on Chinese nationals from entering the country. In some East Asian countries, businesses have posted signs saying, “Chinese Not Welcome.” In France, a regional newspaper warned of a “Yellow Alert.” And last week, an email was sent out to residents of the Lorenzo apartments that said a resident had fallen ill and was diagnosed with the coronavirus. 
What followed was a kaleidoscope-like view of USC student reactions: a “Cancel School” petition garnered nearly 10,000 signatures, xenophobic memes were posted on Facebook pages directed at Chinese American students and an overall fear and panic gripped the Trojan campus. University officials released multiple statements that the email was false, and there was no coronavirus outbreak at USC. Seeing how some USC students and others would react if the coronavirus really did make an appearance, it is important to ensure that xenophobia does not make a concurrent appearance. 
First, one must understand that there is a valid concern that the disease’s arrival would cause xenophobic attitudes to crystallize due to an existing historical precedent. Indeed, finding a scapegoat for epidemics is not a novel practice. 
At the onset of the Black Plague, Jewish people were blamed and viciously persecuted. Between 1348 and 1351, the Jewish quarters of European cities and synagogues were sacked with many being murdered in their homes. In the Valentine’s Day Strasbourg Massacre, several hundred Jews were burned at the stake in fear of their spreading the plague. In Speyer, Germany, Jews were buried in wine casks and cast into the Rhine River in fear their corpses were a danger to the Gentile communities. Fast forward to 1793, the yellow fever epidemic gripped Philadelphia to the point that local officials singled out newly arrived actors and artists for spreading the disease. 
Thus, concern for xenophobic attitudes to become apparent cannot necessarily be dismissed. Indeed, negative attitudes against immigrants is often an effect of an epidemic. In 2015, Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Hayagreeva Rao along with graduate Sunasir Dutta conducted a study to investigate xenophobic attitudes. Participants in one group were told that new strains of the flu recently emerged and were asked to imagine where the strains might have come from and how to stop the spread of this virus. They were then asked whether the U.S. should create  an avenue for illegal immigrants who were already in the country to become legal citizens. 
As anticipated, simply thinking about contagion made respondents less likely to support immigrant legalization measures. The Stanford researchers recognize that their pilot study has weak points, yet stand by their belief that results would be much more pronounced in real-world situations. 
Humans have never lived in a bacterially sterile world. And humans have never dared to envision a future where infectious disease is banished to history books lest we join those past great civilizations that relied solely on fanciful illusions. Every day, people leave the comfort and security of their apartments and college dorms and expose themselves to the germs of the world, whether that be through sitting next to a student who has been sneezing for weeks on end or being squished by strangers on the Metro. Some of the responses to the outbreak of the coronavirus are rational: When a person is sick, we have always been told to stay away from them. Yet, there is a difference between disassociation and discrimination. 
If we wish to be rational beings, then it is important to understand that difference and to also understand that there is a bigger virus to worry about than the coronavirus: the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 19 million Americans have fallen ill with the flu so far this season, which includes 180,000 and hospitalizations; an estimated 10,000 deaths, more than 60 of which were children. 
There seems to be much cleaning to do in our own American households first before we begin to vilify our foreign counterparts. The Undergraduate Student Government released a statement last week affirming the rights of Asian and Asian American students on campus, making clear the need to support the rights of all students to live, study and participate at USC regardless of their race, ethnicity, national origin and travel history.

The government intends to seek sentences higher than the sentencing guidelines for four parents — including two USC parents — in the college admissions case, according to a memorandum filed in federal court Monday.
In the memorandum, federal prosecutors requested sentences exceeding guidelines for those parents named in the admissions case they said were exceptionally culpable. The prosecution cited the number of times each parent employed admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer’s “side doors” and the amount of money they paid to cheat on college entrance exams and bribe college administrators for their children’s admission.
Douglas Hodge, a former investment company CEO who pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, worked with Singer over the course of 11 years to arrange for two of his children’s fraudulent admission to USC and two to Georgetown University before attempting  the same for his fifth child with Loyola Marymount University.
Hot Pockets executive Michelle Janavs pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering for paying $100,000 to rig her two daughters’ ACT scores and $200,000 to bribe senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel to admit her daughter to USC as a beach volleyball recruit.
Prosecutors recommended a two-year sentence for Hodge in addition to a $200,000 fine, three years of supervised release and 300 hours of community service, higher than the zero to six months prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. They requested a penalty of 21 months in prison, a $175,000 fine, three years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service for Janavs.
The longest sentence issued to date in the Operation Varsity Blues case was six months in prison, one year of supervised release, a $150,000 fine and 200 hours of community service to USC alumnus and parent Toby Macfarlane in November after he paid $450,000 for his two children’s admission. Prior to the filing of the memorandum, the highest sentence recommendation the government made was 18 months in prison.
The prosecutors argued that penalizing parents who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe university officials equally to those who paid $15,000 to rig an exam would be unjust and stated that federal sentencing guidelines recommend adjusting sentences up or down based on the scale of the loss caused by the crime. 
Because the personal gains from each case of fraud in the admissions scandal is difficult to quantify, the federal government stated it used the size of the payments the parents made to Singer to facilitate their children’s admission as a gauge of appropriate punishment. The memorandum also noted the parents defrauded the IRS by claiming their illegitimate donations as deductions on their tax returns and involved their children in the scheme, exacerbating the charges’ gravity.
Government prosecutors stated that the scheme rendered significant financial losses to the universities the parents defrauded. They listed the salaries paid to employees who participated in the admissions scheme, the thorough investigations each university launched into its own admissions process and the reputational damage resulting in a decrease in applications for admission following the scandal as costs shouldered by the institutions that merited restitution from the parents.
Because USC has not yet released application data for the Class of 2024, the prosecution’s predictions of lower application numbers and the resulting loss of revenue could not be verified. However, the memorandum cited a May E-Poll Market Research poll that found “cheating” and “scandal” to be the words most often associated with the University in the wake of the release of the federal admissions investigation as evidence of reputational harm. 
In March, USC announced an internal investigation of 33 students’ admissions files and several donations made in connection with the scandal, has hired private consultants to review the University’s admissions practices and has begun to implement a more intensive process for accepting athletic recruits.

Shortly after arriving on campus in August, Reagan Griffin Jr. and Eddie Sun partnered with Julio Martinez to kick off “Hoop & Holler,” a weekly student-run podcast bridging the gap between sports, pop culture and social issues.
“The idea was in our archives for a good year,” said Sun, a freshman  majoring in journalism. “When we both got in and got to campus, it was like, let’s get started.” 
A continuation of informal basketball debates that began at a USC sports media summer program where the trio met as high school students, the “Hoop & Holler” group has held shows ranging from their “All-Decade” NBA lineups, debating the concept of “load management” — where healthy players sit out games to rest their bodies  — and most recently more serious discussions on the tragedy involving NBA star Kobe Bryant. 
“We have these conversations all the time. The only difference is we’re putting a microphone in our faces now,” said Griffin Jr., a freshman majoring in journalism.
The podcast is just one component of a sports media outlet — or “pseudo-blog,” as Griffin Jr. calls it — known as “SquareOne Media,” which the group uses to freely publish their own sports-related content.
The podcast itself consists of three co-hosts: Martinez, a sophomore majoring in communication, Griffin Jr. and Sun. Each episode, the trio takes on the hottest storylines in sports entertainment with discussion and analysis while attempting to maintain a healthy balance between the two.
“I think a lot of NBA content now is kind of clip-driven or drama-driven, and it’s not super substantive,” Sun said. “I think there can be a happy medium between hard-hitting analysis and entertainment commentary and I think [that’s] what we try to strive for.” 
Miki Turner, an assistant professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has worked with each of the show’s three hosts during the summer camp. In their time as students at USC, she said she saw their passion and knowledge on the topic during the summer camp successfully transition into their podcast.  
“They give well-balanced, thoughtful, insightful commentary on what’s going on in the world of sports and I love to just see that continuing to grow,” Turner said. 
She said the trio was able to maintain the quality of conversation throughout each subject they discussed. 
“I’m just mad they’ve never had me on,” Turner said. “They’re very diligent in their research and they know what they’re talking about.”
The friendship that has developed between Griffin Jr., Sun and Martinez makes conversation flow smoothly while allowing room for thoughtful, more serious commentary when appropriate. 
“We’re all friends — good friends,” Griffin Jr. said. “It’s pretty lax, but at the same time we like to put out good thoughts, ideas and things that people can actually take away and learn from.” 
Sun poked fun at Griffin Jr. for his excessive note-taking in preparation for recording shows, as the pair explained each host has their own personal routine for show preparation. 
“I’m a little more tedious with my notes and stuff,” Griffin Jr. said. “Eddie … already has his thoughts lined up already. And Julio is kind of somewhere in the middle.” 
Not to be lost in the show’s light hearted nature is the diverse makeup of the production team, which, according to Turner, keeps conversations interesting and perspectives fresh. 
“You’ve got a Black guy, a Latino and an Asian talking about sports,” Turner said. “Where else in America do you have that?” 
As for the hosts themselves, they try to keep things as natural as possible. 
“It’s just … something that we do on Fridays — it’s something that we enjoy doing,” Griffin Jr. said. “Something I like to say all the time is that we have these [basketball] conversations all the time.” 
Sun said he believes fellow students should be proactive and get involved at USC, especially in Annenberg, which offers tools to create podcasts and live broadcasts. 
“With the resources we have, it’s pretty simple to start it up,” Sun said. “If it’s something that people are interested in, there’s not a lot of hurdles to jump through. It’s just more about commitment than anything else.” 
Turner said she believes the show’s ability to toe the line between professionalism and friendly banter makes the podcast  unique and capable of reaching a much larger audience. 
“They are having the time of their life,” Turner said. “This can go beyond their USC years … I think they have something that could become quite iconic.”

Accounting and management professor Mark Young is defined by more than his research in accounting. Young, who has been teaching the subject for the past 40 years, has applied his expertise in accounting to areas such as entertainment. 
Young was named the recipient of the 2020 American Accounting Association Lifetime Contribution Award in January at the mid-year meeting in Houston for his studies in management control system design. These systems use both financial and non-financial measures to help companies assess performance among their employees and aid managers in future motivation of their workers. 
“It’s not really something you expect, so when you get something like this it takes a long time to process,” Young said. “It’s very gratifying to feel that people think I deserve such an award.” 
Starting as a doctoral student at the University of Pittsburgh, Young has focused his research on methods to decrease costs and increase company performance. 
Young has worked on figuring out what methods to use to decrease costs and increase company performance since. 
“Management accounting really looks at the way the internal performance of an organization is assessed using … things like cost accounting and performance metrics,” Young said. “I look at the way those numbers are produced and the way they affect behavior inside organizations … If those optimal levels [of costs for projects] are met, what happens to people on those teams in terms of their motivation and performance evaluation?”
Much of his research on management and control systems has come in the automobile field. One of his studies compared the implementation of management control systems at General Motors and Chrysler. 
Young’s findings led him to write a book, “Implementing Management Innovations: Lessons Learned from Activity Based Costing in the U.S. Automobile Industry,” which describes more efficient means of implementing the costing systems in the automobile industry. 
Inspired by his film and television interests in high school, Young decided to incorporate his background in accounting into the entertainment industry by creating a class at USC for Master of Business Administration students called Management and Organization of the Creative Industries. The class teaches students how the film, television, music and games industries function from an organizational standpoint and the necessity of cost minimization in entertainment production.
“I realized that we didn’t have a business course for our MBA students who wanted to go into the entertainment business,” Young said. “I used my contacts in Los Angeles … [to figure out] what does the accounting side of Hollywood look like because the way Hollywood accounts for projects is very different.”
Young said he has been interested in the arts and entertainment industry since before entering academia.
“Even though I became an accounting professor, those [entertainment] interests were things I was always interested in the business side, but never really had an opportunity to study that,” Young said. 
Young’s other book, “The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism is Seducing America,” which he co-wrote with Dr. Drew Pinsky, details the rise of celebrity narcissism and the effect it has had on the rest of the U.S. 
Alumna Kendal Barrett said she learned more as a teaching assistant for the course than other classes she was enrolled in as a student. Young’s ability to effortlessly form bonds with students outside of the course stood out to her, she said.
“The compassion and the genuine nature that Mark has and his ability to follow up with people and stay connected [is something I admire],” Barrett said. “A lot of teachers don’t necessarily go the extra mile to do that.” 
Although Young specializes in research, he said the highlight of his career has been the opportunity to instruct more than 12,000 students, many of whom he now considers close friends. 
Leventhal School of Accounting Dean William Holder said in an email to the Daily Trojan that the school is very proud of Young as well as of all its professors doing research and receiving national and international recognition for the work they did. 
“Through his sustained research, Mark has expanded substantially the knowledge in his field and this award recognizes those many contributions,” Holder wrote. “It is also remarkable that Mark’s wife, Ernst & Young Professor of Accounting Sarah Bonner, also recently received an award for her many contributions.”
Leventhal professors Patricia Dechow, Richard Sloan, Sarah Bonner, Clive Lennox and Ken Merchant have also received similar awards by the AAA in the past for their work in accounting.

The USC track and field teams finished their second official tournament of the 2020 season at the Texas Tech Invitational Saturday afternoon at the Sports Performance Center in Lubbock, Texas.
Expectations are high once again for both the USC men’s and women’s teams for the upcoming season, as both were ranked in the preseason top 5 by the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.
Day one of the competition was highlighted by junior sprinter Twanisha “TeeTee” Terry posting a mark of 7.19 seconds in the women’s 60-meter dash, good for the top spot at the tournament.
Terry is aiming to become the first female Trojan to take home the Bowerman Award for the nation’s top track athlete in program history. She was named to the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association’s preseason watch list for the award, earning a spot on the list along with senior sprinter Angie Annelus and junior hurdler Chanel Brissett.
The last Trojan to win the award was sprinter Michael Norman, who became the first male to take home the award for USC in 2018.
A close second to Terry in the 60-meter was fellow USC sophomore sprinter Lanae-Tava Thomas, who posted a personal best mark of 7.24 seconds, giving her a second place finish and placing her at sixth on USC’s all time 60-meter list.
Sophomore sprinter Bailey Lear and junior sprinter Kaelin Roberts finished first and second for USC in the women’s 400-meter, as Lear ran a career-best 52.74 seconds to claim the top spot.
Another impressive showing for the Trojans came from redshirt freshman jumper Jalyn Jackson, who finished fourth in the men’s triple jump after posting a mark of 52 feet and 4 inches, or 15.95 meters.
Despite not making the podium, Jackson’s mark was the top score recorded among collegiate athletes at the event.
Day two of the competition was headlined by the breaking of the USC men’s high jump record by junior jumper Earnest Sears III, who cleared a height of 7 feet, 6.5 inches to secure a first place finish and a school record.
Sears came close but was ultimately unable to clear 7 feet, 7.75 inches, a mark which would have tied him for fourth on the all-time collegiate indoor high jump list.
USC’s women’s 4×400-meter relay team took home first place following strong legs from all four sprinters involved, including stellar sub-53-second legs from sophomore Bailey Lear and senior Kyra Constantine.
Junior Kaelin Roberts and senior Anna Cockrell ran the middle two legs of the relay, combining with Lear and Constantine to post a combined first-place mark of 3 minutes, 32.87 seconds. 
Senior distance runner Isaiah Jewett finished first in the men’s 800-meter race, posting a time of 1 minute, 47.12 seconds — just a few tenths of a second off his career best time of 1 minute, 46.11 seconds posted last season.
Annelus — a two-time NCAA 200-meter outdoor champion and defending Pac-12 women’s track athlete of the year — did not compete in the tournament.
The Trojans will be in action in two weeks as they head up north to Seattle for the Husky Classic Feb. 14 and 15.

The first game at Staples Center since the tragic helicopter accident that took the lives of Kobe and Gianna Bryant and seven others was the most complicated rooting experience I’ve had to date.
Mascara ran down my cheeks as I took in the Lakers’ touching video tribute to Kobe ahead of Friday’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers. I fought to hold back tears as Lakers forward LeBron James read the names of all nine passengers who had died in the crash.
Let’s establish that I grew up in a family that has been rooted in Portland for over 40 years. As a Blazers fan, I was taught from a young age that the Lakers are to basketball as the New England Patriots are to football — you either love them or you hate that they dominate.
Despite my strong allegiance to Rip City, I found myself texting my parents on Friday night: “Do the Blazers even want to win this game? Should we want them to win this game?”
Experiencing the aftermath of Kobe’s death while living in Los Angeles was truly indescribable. I was covering a game at Galen Center at the time — the same place where I had stood five feet away from Kobe and Gianna only a year ago — and could feel a palpable dip in the crowd’s energy as they became aware of the devastating news. I drove through downtown Sunday night and took in the purple and gold lights that shined over the city as it grieved the loss of its star.
I have friends, professors and classmates who had personal connections to the victims, to the crash site and even to Kobe himself. Sure, I grew up rooting against the Lakers, but I was immersed enough in the Los Angeles community that I couldn’t imagine how it would respond to any outcome other than a Lakers win that night.
On paper, Friday’s game was an important one for my team. Yes, one game in the midst of an 82-game season is not going to make or break a team, but the Blazers had recently emerged as potential playoff contenders despite an injury-plagued start to the season. The team was also coming in with momentum after back-to-back wins and an unprecedented scoring streak by star point guard Damian Lillard, who averaged 48.5 points in his prior four outings.
Despite all of this, I believed the only way to bring hope to a grieving community was for the Lakers to come out on top. So I spent the first quarter of the game rooting against my team of 19 years. As the two teams exchanged 24- and 8-second violations to honor Kobe’s two retired jersey numbers, though, it was clear that this game was bigger than any player, team or league.
The two teams could not have put on a better show in Kobe’s honor. A high-scoring first half saw the Lakers with a 62-60 lead heading into halftime, and Lakers forward Anthony Davis put up 18 points in the first quarter alone.
As I listened to Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa perform “See You Again” at halftime, I realized that Kobe would have wanted both teams to leave everything on the court. After Lillard ended the game with 48 points en route to a 127-119 Blazer win, I thought to myself, “Kobe probably would have congratulated Dame for that game, despite the outcome.”
I realized that the tragic deaths of these nine basketball players, coaches and parents left its mark not only on the Lakers and L.A. but on the entire basketball community.
Blazers forward Carmelo Anthony, for example, did not make the trip to L.A., and it wasn’t hard to figure out why.
“YOU just called me and told me you were coming to the game Friday and that you were proud of me and ‘regardless of anything, stay true to myself and STAYME70,” Anthony wrote in an Instagram caption below a photo of him and Kobe in a tight embrace.
Wins and losses are the accepted way of measuring success in sports games, and I had trouble reconciling that this one was different. The Blazers came away with a convincing win, but while I might have texted a couple of people that it was “Lillard Time” as he continued to drain shots from deep in the second half, I otherwise felt numb to the victory.
I entered the week rooting for the Blazers and entered the game rooting for the Lakers, but in the end, this game was not about allegiance. The stellar efforts by Lillard, Davis and James — all of whom put up 20-plus points — demonstrated a commitment to honoring Kobe’s legacy that transcended the boundaries of any player or team.
It wasn’t about a tally in the win or loss column. It was about honor, fight and showcasing the “Mamba Mentality.”
Lillard expressed this sentiment as reporters asked him how he felt after his remarkable outing, in which he fell just one rebound short of his second career triple-double. These numbers would normally be a cause for celebration, but stats were the furthest thing from Lillard’s mind.
“Nobody wins tonight,” Lillard said in an interview with Yahoo Sports. “You don’t walk away from this game with too much to be proud about because of the circumstances. We got the win, but I think the moment and what it was about tonight is the one thing I won’t forget.”

The USC men’s volleyball team competed in two matchups over the weekend, defeating Cal State Northridge on the road Friday before falling in four sets to No. 4 UCI at home Saturday.
Led by redshirt sophomore outside and opposite hitter Billy Fauntleroy’s 16 kills and junior middle blocker Sam Lewis’ four blocks, the Trojans narrowly eked out the Matadors in a tough five-set battle Friday.
Each set was decided by no more than five points, and the Trojans fell into a 2-1 hole three sets in before eventually forcing it to a winner-take-all fifth frame. USC fell down 16-15 to give the Matadors match point but rattled off three straight points to pull out the decisive 18-16 victory.
The Trojans, however, were unable to carry that momentum into Saturday’s tilt with the Anteaters.
Saturday’s game was held at USC’s North Gym due to a scheduling conflict in Galen Center, the Trojans’ typical home, where the USC men’s basketball team was hosting Colorado that same night.
USC competed with the Anteaters after UCI jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first set, but ultimately the Trojans could not overcome UCI’s strong front row and fell to a 1-0 deficit.
UCI kept the Trojans at bay, dominating the next set to the tune of an 11-point victory. Heading into the third set, however, head coach Jeff Nygaard recalibrated the Trojans’ defense, helping USC storm right back into the match with a 25-13 victory in the frame.
“Our blocking adjustment was just to have ours set a little bit point side and then we started getting a little more touches,” freshman outside hitter Adam Flood said after the match. “That was the big turn-around game three. It was a great coaching adjustment by our coach, Jeff Nygaard, and it really showed. We had a really good third set.”
The team noticeably played with more discipline, resulting in greater quality plays and an 11-point run to give the Trojans a 24-12 lead and all but put UCI away for the set.
Despite USC slowing UCI’s offense, picking up a 20-14 lead and appearing primed for its second five-set battle in as many days, the Anteaters eventually caught up to the Trojans in the last 4 points of the match and USC fell in a four-set battle.
Despite having only one senior on the court, the Trojans played quality volleyball the entire match and made the necessary adjustments to compete with the Anteaters after a slow start.
Having hung with strong and experienced opponents like No. 9 Penn State and UCI, the Trojans are developing at a fast pace and gaining valuable experience as the young team progresses through the season.
“There is not a team [in] the NCAA that is learning faster than we are,” Nygaard said after Saturday’s match. “So you can look at the record and be a little disheartened if you want to. But I look at it as, yeah, we are doing it now so that toward the end of the season once we put it together, we can be the most dangerous team in the tournament.”
USC will travel to face UC San Diego at 7 p.m. Thursday before returning home to play Grand Canyon University at Galen Center at 7 p.m. Saturday.

The road losing streak continues for the USC women’s basketball team, which went 0-2 over the weekend against No. 18 Arizona State and No. 16 Arizona. The Trojans fell one point short in a triple-overtime thriller against the Sun Devils with a final score of 76-75 and could never fully recover from a 10-point deficit to Arizona in a 73-57 loss.
The last time the women’s basketball team won away from Galen Center was back in November at the South Point Shootout. The Trojans have since gone 0-5 in away conference games. USC is now 11-10 overall on the season and 3-7 in the Pac-12. 
In Friday’s game against ASU, the Trojans fought back from a 12-point deficit to reach a back-and-forth final quarter battle that ended in a 51-51 tie. A notable defensive adjustment at the half and a cleaner offense helped spur the comeback as the team held the Sun Devils’ shooting under 33% and cut their 28 first-half turnovers to just six for the rest of regulation. 
Throughout the overtime periods, neither team saw more than a 4-point advantage, making for a nail-biting 15 minutes of play. Freshmen standouts guard Endyia Rogers and forward Alissa Pili — the past three Pac-12 Freshman of the Week award winners — stepped up by draining two 3-pointers each and fighting for key rebounds after sophomore point guard Desiree Caldwell fouled out in the first overtime period. 
Rogers posted her first 30-point performance as a Trojan and continued her three-game streak of beating her previous points record. Pili followed with another personal-record-breaking performance, contributing a career-best three blocks and four steals. 
It was ASU’s sharpshooting that would nab it a 1-point lead to seal the deal with just two seconds remaining. Senior guard Reili Richardson hit the game-winning 3-pointer off an offensive rebound and an assist by senior forward Jamie Rudan. 
Despite the tough loss, senior forward Kayla Overbeck said the team still had a lot of positives to take away from the game.
“It’s really a sucky feeling, obviously, having to end the game the way that it ended,” Overbeck said. “That’s not the result that we wanted, but it showed us that we have so much fight and this is the third time we’ve gone to an overtime game, sixth overall, and it just shows that we’re never gonna give up.”
On Sunday, USC got down by 10 points to the Wildcats by the end of the first quarter, but unlike the previous game against ASU, Arizona didn’t allow the Trojans to fight back and even things up. The Wildcats outpaced the Trojans off of fast breaks and turnovers and dominated in the paint, never allowing USC to come closer than 3 points near the end of the second quarter.
The game was solidified in the fourth with Arizona shooting 62% from the field. A 3-pointer by junior guard Aari McDonald boosted the Wildcats’ lead to a comfortable 13 points with five minutes left — a lead that would only grow as time wound down. 
McDonald led the Wildcats’ offense with 20 points while sophomore forward Cate Reese shut down USC’s offense by logging 13 defensive rebounds — 17 boards overall. 
Rogers took a step back this game on her offensive production, finishing with only 7 points. Pili continued her strong play, though, leading the team with 21 points and adding five rebounds en route to winning her second Pac-12 Freshman of the Week in three weeks. Graduate guard Aliyah Jeune logged five rebounds of her own and added a team-high three assists out of just nine overall for the team. 
“These are two quality teams that we played — two top-20 teams and Arizona might even be a top-10 team, so I’m proud of the kids,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “They worked hard and they competed and we’re only gonna get better.”
USC will have to turn around and hit the road again within a week to face two conference opponents: Cal and No. 6 Stanford. This will be the team’s first meeting with both in-state rivals.

As of 2015, USC had the capacity to house only 34% of its 18,810 undergraduate students through on-campus dorms. With the construction of USC Village in 2017, new undergraduate apartments and the McCarthy Honors Residential College allowed for an additional 2,500 beds. However, as of the 2019-20 school year, the undergraduate student body has grown to 20,500. This means that although the University’s ability to house undergraduate students did increase by a little under 10%, it still does not reach even half of the total number of undergraduate students.
On Forbes 100 Top Colleges List from 2015, USC ranked in the top 10 schools with the lowest dorm capacity. In comparison, Boston University, a private school with a similar undergraduate population of 17,286, had the capacity to house 80% of its undergraduate students in dorms in 2015, guaranteeing on-campus housing for all four years of undergraduate study. In fact, almost half of all Top 100 colleges on the list could house 90% or more of their undergraduate students. 
Despite USC’s $5.5 billion endowment, which is over double the amount of Boston University’s, the University guarantees undergraduate students half the years of undergraduate housing. USC put $700 million into funding USC Village, which includes not only housing but also stores and restaurants, so it is not unrealistic for the University to undertake a similar project to build more living spaces for upperclassmen. 
Guaranteeing four years of on-campus housing does not mean USC will have to build enough buildings to house every undergraduate student enrolled. Inevitably, some local students will choose to commute from home and others will choose to live in surrounding off-campus housing. The Forbes article claims that 50% of undergraduate students choose to live off-campus at the University of Chicago, so the school is able to guarantee four years of housing despite having a 53% capacity. In this way, USC may be able to get away with having a relatively low dorm capacity, depending on student interest.
There are several benefits to guaranteed housing for all four years of undergraduate study. Not only does living on campus make it more convenient to get to and from classes, but it also makes it more convenient to use USC facilities such as its libraries, labs, gyms and the Engemann Student Health Center, ensuring that students have easy access to the resources they need. And because students spend less time traveling, this allows them to maximize their time spent studying or working out, promoting better learning as well as physical and mental health.
It is also easier to find a community within the school when constantly surrounded by peers, which is characteristic of on-campus housing. Residential college life is important for a  student’s  freshman year when everyone is especially determined to make new friends but having opportunities to interact with new people and deepen existing friendships is always valuable, even into the later years of college. Living on campus makes it easier to take advantage of the communal aspects of on-campus housing; while having to share a bathroom with everyone on the floor may not be amazing, living in a dorm means that, more often than not, there will be other students to hang out or study in lounges with.
This being said, there are issues to consider when discussing the addition of new buildings to campus. Back in 2017, the USC Village project was criticized for displacing several small businesses that were part of the original University Village, replacing them with the corporate chain stores and eateries that exist now. Adding even more housing units may again jeopardize the stability of surrounding local businesses.
One way to work around this may be to build up instead of out. While a freshman dorm Fluor Tower Residential College rises 11 stories, many of the other housing units are anywhere from three to eight floors. Adding another building with 11 or more stories may be a more effective way to add beds for undergraduate students while still keeping in mind the surrounding community. It would be more effective than adding several short buildings like in USC Village.
Ultimately, USC should consider adding more buildings so that it can guarantee housing for all four years of students’ undergraduate study. On-campus housing facilitates a better learning and social environment and is equally important for upperclassmen.

As the Feb. 6 effective date for the federal flavor ban on electronic cigarettes nears, it feels timely to reflect on the youth vaping epidemic. It came out of left field, baffling the medical community and legislators alike and still shows no signs of turning down the heat. Though Juul Labs, the San Francisco-based company that once dominated the e-cigarette market, has gone under fire for igniting the crisis, you know what they say, when one door closes, another one opens, and young vapers have found that open door in the Puff Bar and other disposable e-cigarettes. 	
Let’s start from the beginning. In late 2019, a federal survey released by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a whopping 25% of the nation’s high school students vaped in the last month, which is up a startling 21% from 2018. These jarring numbers were accompanied by the outbreak of a mysterious vaping-related illness that claimed 59 lives and put 2,602 in the hospital. Thirty nine percent of the afflicted were between the ages of 18 and 24, followed by 15% under 18 — and that’s only in the U.S. so far. Many held the Juul to blame and rightfully so: Its discrete, aesthetic design and kid-friendly flavors, such as mint and mango, were a recipe for illicit underage consumption. When the Trump administration announced in September of last year that it would ban flavored e-cigarettes from the market, many breathed a sigh of relief. 
Juul was valued at $38 billion in July; by October, it had lost more than a third of that. The company has only slid further since; Altria, a Marlboro parent company, announced late January that the value of its investment in Juul dropped by more than $4 billion. This all comes at the same time as legal cases against the e-cigarette maker have spiked at 80%. On paper, it looks like a loss for the bad guys and a triumph for the good guys, but that is not the whole story.	
The Trump administration decided to prohibit fruit, mint and dessert flavors in refillable cartridge-based e-cigarettes such as Juul, but a policy loophole that went largely unpublicized has now taken center stage. A footnote on page nine of the new policy allows all flavors to continue to be sold in devices that are designed to be disposed of after the nicotine runs dry. This is where the Puff Bar comes into play.	
While outside pressure led Juul to discontinue all its flavors except menthol and tobacco, holes in the government’s flavor ban have opened the door to an array of competing brands that produce disposables — blu, Posh, Stig and the infamous Puff Bar to name a few. A Puff Bar, at $7-10 a pop, is more cost-effective than spending almost $30 on a pack of pods and has the same nicotine content. Its design is just as sleek and even more colorful, leaning into the same marketing tactics that got Juul in trouble in the first place. While information about the privately-owned company’s value and profits is scarce, all one has to do is take a look around USC to see that the Puff Bar’s momentum is picking up fast. 
The deceptiveness of the Juul lies largely in its aesthetic, and while the same thing holds true for the Puff Bar, there are more layers to consider. There is an insidious nature that is specific to disposable e-cigarettes — namely, the fact that it is far more conducive to an, “Oh, I’ll quit after this one,” mentality than Juul ever was. It seems easy to toss it out when the flavor runs dry and return to a nicotine-free life, until it is not easy at all. It is not a better alternative to the Juul; it is virtually the same thing, with more flavors, more waste and a shorter lifespan. 
It seems, then, that this policy was not put in place with the end-all goal of curbing the vaping epidemic but rather to appease both a panicking public and big tobacco giants without making any real sacrifices. The Trump administration did not close the wound the Juul left; it simply put a Band-Aid over a bullet wound and hoped for the best. When Boot Bullwinkle, a spokesperson for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, expressed: “This policy basically provided a road map for the e-cig industry to continue using flavored products to addict kids,” he was not wrong.
 It will not be a surprise when new data shows that youth nationwide are still vaping in masses. The problem has not been mitigated, and it is imperative to call out flimsy legislation at every turn. The magnitude of this epidemic is still to be determined but the integrity of the new policy is not.
