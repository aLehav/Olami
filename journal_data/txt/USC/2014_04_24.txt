In commemoration of the 99th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, USC’s Armenian Students’ Association and the Shoah Foundation hosted the Armenian Genocide Awareness Talk at Tommy Trojan on Thursday.

According to the Armenian National Institute, the genocide officially began on April 24, 1915, when over 200 Armenian community leaders were apprehended and later executed in Turkey during the reign of the Ottoman Empire. Over the next eight years, approximately one and a half million Armenians were killed. The political party in power in Turkey during this time, commonly referred to as the Young Turks, carried out the killings.
The event included two guest speakers — Executive Director of the Shoah Foundation Stephen Smith and criminal defense attorney RJ Manuelian — and music including the bands VIZA, Armenian Public Radio and R-Mean, as well as art installations and food displays. The gathering served as a moment to remember those who were killed in the genocide and reflect on the genocide as a whole.
Smith spoke about the world’s reluctance to acknowledge the Armenian genocide.
“The world has been in denial,” Smith said. “We owe those who have fallen recognition, not only by the    U.S. but by the world.”
He continued to speak directly to the students in the audience about how they must carry on the torch.
“The obligation is now passed on to the diaspora of Armenians to remember the genocide,” he said. “The obligation is now passed on to all of you.”
Haig Aintablian, president of the Armenian Students’ Association, spoke about his personal experience with the genocide, in which some of his family were victims.
“My [great-grandmother] was personally in the Armenian Genocide,” Aintablian said. “I heard stories of it from my grandma, very very horrific stories. I didn’t realize it was something that would affect me until I joined the board of the USC ASA.”
Aintablian continued to speak about how awareness of the genocide is highly limited.
“Historically it’s so sad not to see it widespread and people don’t know about it,” Aintablian said. “The main thing is for USC students to know about what happened. We’re all going to be the next generation of politicians, the next generation to impact the United States. It’s important that we ourselves are knowledgeable on these important events, especially things like genocide.”
Those in attendance found the event to be an important medium for increasing awareness.
“This is the largest turnout I’ve ever seen,” said Silva Sevlian, a USC alumna and now full-time employee of the Shoah Foundation. “There is actually a substantial Armenian population here at USC. It’s really an important event for them and the community as a whole.”
Mariam Mosinyan, a junior majoring in communication, stressed the need to be privy to the past and present.
“It’s part of my heritage and my history — it’s important to be aware of what’s going on in the community and contribute in any way,” Mosinyan said. “If me being here and bringing a couple of my friends who aren’t Armenian to learn about the issue helps in any way, then that’s what I am going to do.”
Manuelian, the final speaker, discussed USC’s involvement in the remembrance of the genocide as an important responsibility.
“This is a place of learning, where denial cannot take place,” Manuelian said. “Today we are here to remember … Remembrance is the first act of knowledge and knowledge is the first act of ensuring that the denial does not continue.”

At an intimate gathering of students in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Franklin Room, novelist Augusten Burroughs spoke to students about his career as a writer and the events in his life that influenced his work. The event was sponsored by Program Board, USC Spectrum and the Queer & Ally Student Assembly.
Reflection · Novelist Augusten Burroughs, author of Running with Scissors, discussed his past experiences struggling with alcohol. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
“There was no structure or normalcy in my life,” Burroughs said. “So I never really learned what was normal or mainstream.”
Burroughs, who said he had never read a book until he was 24, was born in Pittsburgh, Penn. in 1965 but grew up in western Massachusetts. His mother left him in the care of her psychiatrist after his parents divorced.
He eventually earned his GED and went to work in advertising first in San Francisco and later Manhattan. He excelled at work but was also battling alcoholism and checked into a rehabilitation facility when he was 30.
“In rehab I became sort of a star, like a popular kid, because I was the one who drank the most,” he said.
Burroughs, who is openly gay, said he had a partner for many years whom he avoided being in love with because his partner was HIV positive. When his partner passed away, Burroughs relapsed into drinking while continuing work advertising freelance. He was spiraling deeper into drinking when his writing career began unexpectedly.
“I woke up one day and wrote something that made me laugh,” he said. “And I hadn’t laughed in a year and half so I kept writing.”
Writing helped wean him off alcohol because it was “Elmer’s glue in the mind,” and after writing for seven days he had finished the first draft of what would become his first novel, Sellevision, which was released in 2000. After contacting multiple agents, he eventually found one who agreed to read the manuscript and later signed him as a client.
“Writing helped relieve the itch, which alcohol never scratched,” he said.
Sellevision launched his writing career, and Burroughs then gave his journals to his agent, who helped him turn them into another novel which his publisher bought. He then got the idea for a memoir based on his troubled and unusual childhood. This memoir would eventually become Running with Scissors.
“I spent years in advertising chasing money, and I was miserable,” he said, “As an author, I was making less than $10,000 a year but I was happy.”
Burroughs said he did his best to write about the events as they happened, despite his apprehension about revisiting his past.
“When you’re really truthful in the writing, it’s always okay,” he said.
Running with Scissors was a huge financial and critical success, and gave Burroughs the opportunity to go on tour and meet readers who connected with the story.
“It doesn’t really matter what you say,” he said. “People can smell the truth, the truth weighs more in your chest, it’s not something you can smell, or taste or hear, but you feel it in your sternum.”
Students at the event were struck by the journey into Burroughs life.
“The insight into the psyche of an author was really interesting to hear, the extent to which he described his writing process and how his memory came through, and how he wrote this work that was kind of haphazard but went on to become a great best seller,” said Bobby Sachs, a junior majoring in business administration.
Others were touched by his honesty.
“I’ve read two of his books, and I was really interested in hearing him speak because I know his story and wanted to know what he had to say about it in person,” said Dylan Lee, a freshman majoring in international relations and the incoming assistant director of QuASA. “[I liked] how candid he is with his experiences because they’re obviously very difficult things to go through — I think that’s why his story touches so many people, because he’s so honest.”

On Thursday, the National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, USC’s research center for risk and management analysis related to homeland security, hosted its 10-year anniversary conference at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
‘I am the captain now’ · Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama was the closing speaker of CREATE’s 10-Year Anniversary event, which took place on Thursday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Phillips spoke on the 2009 hijacking of his ship by Somali pirates. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The all-day event’s closing speaker was Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama. In 2009, a team of Somali pirates hijacked Phillips’ ship and held him hostage until a team of U.S. Navy SEALs rescued him; the incident inspired the 2013 film starring Tom Hanks, Captain Phillips, and made Phillips a national hero.
Sponsored by the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Sol Price School of Public Policy, the event also featured panelists such as Randy Hall, vice president of research and co-founder of CREATE, and Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Panels involving “Next Generation’s Greatest Chaos,” “Advancing Homeland Security through University Research” and “The Changing Face of Terrorism” were also featured.
Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School, introduced Phillips. Yortsos briefly discussed how rapid technological advances have expanded engineers’ role in society before commending Phillips’ heroism, calling Phillips a true American hero.
“Engineering can now enable disciplines which in the past were nontraditional, like risk analysis, economics and behavioral science,” Yortsos said. “CREATE has utilized this convergence to help our country.”
Phillips’ talk focused on leadership, and he emphasized the importance of preparation. Because Phillips knew about the prevalence of pirates off the coast of Somali prior to the highjacking, he organized a disaster drill to test the ship’s security procedures.
After this test, Phillips developed a security protocol with his crew that may have saved their lives during the highjacking. Phillips stressed the importance of flexibility and adapting to situations, however, after sharing that he had to deviate from his plan to eject the pirates from his ship.
Throughout the speech, Phillips reiterated three key points he wanted conference attendees to take away from his experience on to be applied to their own lives.
“I have three things I would like to leave you with: One, you are stronger than you know and you can handle much more than you think,” Phillips said. “Two, the only time it is over is when you say it is over. Three, a motivated, focused team of professionals can solve any problem.”
Throughout his talk, Phillips explained the events as they unfolded during the highjacking. After the pirates boarded the ship and held him at gunpoint, Phillips played what he called “mind games” to prevent further trouble.
For example, Phillips prevented the pirates from calling their headquarters to assist in the highjacking by reconfiguring the radar system so they were unable to do so. Phillips was very humble when he discussed his actions during the hijacking, emphasizing that bravery is possible when one remains calm and maintains a level head during times of duress.
“When faced with a threatening situation, we find something within us to do what must be done,” Phillips said. “It’s not possible to persevere when you’re panicked.”
During the attack, Phillips attempted to regain control of the situation by luring the pirates off the Maersk Alabama and away from the members of his crew, who were hiding below deck. Adding that he wished to clear up one aspect of his portrayal in the media, Phillips said that he did not give himself up with the intent of becoming a hostage or as a heroic sacrifice.
“My strategy was to be their adversary instead of their hostage, so I didn’t give up,” Phillips said. “My major responsibility was to get the pirates off my ship, so I carried out my duty.”

In Locke, writer-director Steven Knight gives audiences a psychological exploration of the murky area between right and wrong, staged entirely inside a moving vehicle. Ivan Locke,  brilliantly played by Tom Hardy, drives both the vehicle and the narrative.
Fast car · Tom Hardy, most popularly known for his role in The Dark Knight Rises, delivers an exceptional performance in Locke, the latest film from writer-director Steven Knight. Locke opens in theaters today. – Photo courtesy of Midnight Review
An upper-middle class construction manager, Locke has a passion for concrete and architecture. It might not sound exciting, but after hearing him converse about stable foundations, viewers will never look at concrete the same way again.
The audience follows Locke on the eve of a huge concrete pour that will serve as the foundation for a new high-rise building, a building that will make Locke an owner of “a piece of the sky” in England. To the surprise of his wife and colleagues, however, Locke can’t attend the pour. He has to drive to see the birth of his bastard child, fathered after a wine-induced affair during a business trip.
Despite this plot point, Locke isn’t a playboy. In fact, he’s a hardworking and practical family man who made one mistake — a mistake he’s trying to fix. Locke is insistent on being present for the child’s birth, but faces the dilemma of betraying his own family in the process. The audience also learns about Locke’s own troubled relationship with his father through monologues about him.
As Locke drives from his workplace to the hospital, the car ride transforms into a large juggling act between calls from work, family members and his one-time lover. His colleague Donal (Andrew Scott), who decides to get drunk during the work crisis, calls incessantly and provides some much-needed comic relief. The two bicker like old friends while the mother of his  future child — and his wife and kids at home — ring simultaneously.
Knight avoids cliché attempts to build suspense, making the film more original. He doesn’t throw predictable roadblocks like traffic jams or an empty gas tank to build tension.
Locke’s mental struggle never becomes overly dramatic either. Hardy’s eyes fill up with tears, he appears to come down with a cold and coughs occasionally, but aside from one or two F-bombs, he stays away from overperforming to compensate for the constraint of being inside a car.
Knight focuses his energy on crafting realistic characters and creating a dynamic environment despite everything taking place inside a car. Even though we never see other characters and only hear their voices through the Bluetooth inside Locke’s car, the dialogue is so well-written viewers are left feeling like they’ve met the whole cast. The film allows viewers to fill in the blanks of the outside world using their imagination.
Despite being inside a car for an hour and a half, Locke never feels closed in or static. Knight might keep his actor chained down to a seat, but his camera captures movement all around. The highway lights of the M6, passing cars and streetlights, filmed in soft focus create a kaleidoscope of colors that reflect off the smooth exterior of Locke’s BMW. The reflected lights often dance across the static image of Locke. This contrast of movement against the stillness serves as a haunting reminder of Locke’s purgatory. He’s driving to greet a new life into the world while he leaves behind a distraught wife and kids.
Also responsible for distracting from the constraints of the car is Hardy’s nuanced and immensely powerful performance despite his inability to move around the frame. But then again, Hardy is no stranger to restraints. His most well-known performance, Bane in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises, was delivered with a mask covering his face. Hardy was left with only his eyes to convey emotions. Similarly, in Locke, the actor communicates most of his emotions through subtleties in his eyes. Whether it’s a mask covering his face or being seat-belted in a car for the entirety of his performance, Hardy knows how to arrest an audience with very little at his disposal.
The film’s only weakness comes from the occasional monologue delivered to Locke’s deceased father. These Shakespearean tangents feel inorganic, especially in light of the naturalistic dialogue and tone throughout the rest of the film.
Overall, Locke delivers an inventive cinematic experience with a memorable performance by Hardy. Though skeptics might call the staging of the film a gimmick, Knight’s story doesn’t contrive moments of suspense, but rather unfolds into a complicated and delicate observation of the human psyche under pressure.

At this point in the semester, all of us — abroad or not — are forced to evaluate what exactly we’ve accomplished over the past four months. What did we learn? Were our classes a waste of time? Did we have fun? Did we have too much fun? Thinking about where we started is the best way to plan for what’s to come.
Students abroad, however, are faced with somewhat different circumstances. We’re about to complete a semester unlike any other, full of new places and experiences. We took on new cities, new languages, new food and new people. We became more than just tourists. Yet what’s in store for our futures seems more like a step backward since many students abroad still have a year or more left before graduation. All of this new wisdom we’ve acquired might have expanded our worldview, but I’ve started to wonder if any of it will even matter when we get home.
When I think about life back at USC, I think of routine. I do pretty much the same things each week, and none of those things are very unique or exciting. As I’ve begun to contemplate returning to my USC routine after an exciting semester abroad, I realize that I’ve started to create a routine for myself in London, too.
A lot of people see studying abroad as one big vacation filled with nights out and weekend trips. Though it’s true that, compared to USC, going abroad means having a lot more freedom, it also means starting from scratch. Between all the sightseeing and travel, a good amount of time is spent doing mundane tasks such as deciphering maps, figuring out where the grocery store is and getting used to a new school, and by no means is creating a brand new life for yourself easy.
Study abroad advisors warn you about culture shock before you go abroad, and at the time, it seems pretty hilarious. It almost sounds like a made-up problem because it’s hard to believe that anyone could feel anything less than amazing while off exploring the world. But I hate to admit that there came a time, for me anyway, when I felt like living abroad really was more work than it was worth. Of course, that feeling passed pretty quickly, but it goes to show that the reality of adjusting to a completely new environment should not be taken lightly.
I say all of this not to put a damper on the singular experience that is studying abroad but to point out that studying abroad has a purpose beyond just travel. It’s not like going to college as a freshman, where someone holds your hand throughout your first semester, telling you where to go and what to do. Instead, you are thrown into a brand new city to sink or swim, and I can imagine that it’s awfully similar to the real world we’ll all be thrust into post graduation.
When I get home, even though I’ll probably go back to doing the same stuff as before, I’ll know that I can make it in a new place, and that’s a comforting feeling considering I will probably have to at some point in the near future. Memories of visiting far-off lands aren’t the only thing that I’m taking away from this experience. The knowledge that I can live anywhere — away from family, most of my friends and even my country — and manage to keep myself alive is just as valuable, if not more so.
In my first column, I talked about how the decision to study abroad is a personal one and how even though you’re gaining a great experience, you are also inevitably missing out on some things going on at USC. At the time, I still wasn’t quite sure I was ready to disconnect from all my friends and the school I love. So, the big question: Was it worth it? Of course it was, and I’d do it all again — awkward moments included — in a heartbeat.
I’m fairly sure that I’ll still be the enthusiastic Trojan I was in December when I return to school in the fall. But if studying abroad has taught me anything, it’s that no matter where you are, there’s always an adventure to be had. Though it’s time to leave London behind, I know that this Trojan’s next adventure is just around the corner.

While star-studded Kickstarter projects such as Zach Braff’s Wish I Were Here and the Veronica Mars movie received millions of dollars and the bulk of the media’s attention in the summer of 2012, hardly anyone noticed when writer-director Jeremy Saulnier reached his modest funding goal of $38,000 and quietly began work on his second feature, the oft-told tale of a man seeking justice for the death of his loved ones. Yet, in spite of its miniscule budget and familiar premise, Blue Ruin is the first unqualified triumph of crowd-funded cinema, a bloodstained gem that cuts through the shallow glories of vigilantism to reveal both the futility and grotesquerie of revenge.
Vengeance is his · Dwight (Macon Blair) returns after years of homeless exile to hunt down the man responsible for his parents’ murder in Jeremy Saulnier’s crowd-funded Blue Ruin, which opens in theaters and VOD today. This revisionist thriller is fueled by the contrast of the low-key anti-hero and the chaos he incites. – Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
When we first meet Dwight, played by the superb Macon Blair, he’s a disheveled beach bum living out of the titular blue ruin: an ancient, rust-bitten Pontiac Bonneville distinguished by a set of barely concealed bullet holes. The opening scene finds him breaking into an unoccupied house for a much-needed bath and a change of clothes. He’s become something of a fixture at the local boardwalk, where he spends his days in a state of catatonic oblivion, his beaten-dog eyes still brimming with the terrible knowledge of the event that brought him to this pitiable state. He seems unbalanced but essentially harmless, a lump of human driftwood waiting to be reclaimed by the sea. All that changes, however, when a curiously accommodating policewoman informs him that his long vigil is over: The man convicted of killing his parents is finally being released from prison.
Filled with the shambling purpose of a reanimated corpse, Dwight returns to his quaint Virginia hometown, intending to finish what the legal system couldn’t. Within the film’s first half-hour, he tracks down his intended target, the vile Wade Cleland (Sandy Barnett) and, in a scene that would be the climax of most revenge flicks, corners him in a bathroom and, after a brief struggle, succeeds in planting a knife in his skull.  Yet in the sage words of Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) in Kill Bill Vol. 1, “Revenge is never a straight line. It’s a forest.” Sure enough, the rest of the gun-toting Cleland clan begins threatening the life of Dwight’s beloved sister Sam, (Amy Hargreaves), a suburban mom with two young daughters. The rest of the film unfolds as a widening gyre of violence and madness, ending with a bloody crescendo that echoes the workmanlike nihilism of Sam Peckinpah.
By the end of Blue Ruin, one thing is abundantly clear: Our bedraggled anti-hero simply isn’t cut out for life as a vigilante. He lacks the coiled menace of Charles Bronson’s Paul Kersey or the righteous, Valkyrian fury of Uma Thurman’s The Bride. His often-staggering ineptitude works to the film’s advantage, however, infusing every scene with the trembling semblance of reality, such as when he forgets his keys in the bathroom after killing Wade or the sequence where he steals a gun from a roadhouse trucker only to be thwarted by a simple safety lock.
The film’s cast is one of its greatest assets. Despite his increasingly murky motivations and the fact that he barely says a word for the majority of the movie, Dwight makes for a weirdly compelling protagonist, his bland features and sheepish demeanor contrasting nicely with the mayhem that seems to follow him wherever he goes. His brief interactions with Hargreaves’ Sam range from darkly funny to genuinely poignant, especially when she lays into him for abandoning her in the wake of their parents’ death, saying, “It’d be all right if you were crazy. But you’re not crazy. You’re just a coward.”
Then there’s Devin Ratray’s welcome turn as Dwight’s childhood friend Ben, an amiable metal-head who helps arm his buddy for his final firefight with the Clelands. The New York native, who also stole the majority of his scenes as one of Will Forte’s slack-jawed cousins in last year’s Nebraska, is quickly proving himself an invaluable character actor. The Clelands themselves are also made up of some famous faces, including a nearly unrecognizable Eve Plumb — better known as Jan Brady from The Brady Bunch — and Kevin Kolack as a motor-mouthed hillbilly assassin who winds up spending the bulk of his screen time trapped in Dwight’s trunk.
From its hypnotic early moments to its lead-poisoned finale, Blue Ruin is a minimalist marvel of tight pacing, lean plotting and carefully ratcheted suspense. In many ways it functions as the antithesis of glossy, predictable revenge thrillers such as Taken and Colombiana, where viewers are invited to cheer on the actions of the avenging protagonist unreservedly.
Saulnier has taken the well-worn tropes of the vigilante movie and stripped them down into something raw and elemental. What remains is a grim exploration of the cyclical nature of payback, an uncommonly bleak film punctuated by moments of macabre humor worthy of comparisons to John Hillcoat’s The Proposition and the Coen Brothers’ masterful debut, Blood Simple. This is brilliant, top-shelf filmmaking from a director who’s clearly just getting started.

The No. 8-ranked USC men’s volleyball team might have lost in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament quarterfinal match last week, but the American Volleyball Coaches Association named three athletes to its annual AVCA Division I-II Men’s All-America teams. Junior setter Micah Christenson garnered first team All-America honors, senior libero Henry Cassiday made Second Team All-America and freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder received an honorable mention.
Setting the standard · Junior setter Micah Christenson was named a first-team All-American by the AVCA on Thursday. The Honolulu native led the team with 26 service aces and 1,046 assists this season. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Christenson turned in a tremendous season for the Trojans. In 24 starts, the setter had 1,046 assists and posted an 11.62 assist per set average, which led the nation. Christenson was also second on the team in digs, recording 210 on the season. This is the Honolulu native’s second All-America honor, having made Volleyball Magazine’s second team last season. The 6-foot-6 captain of the Trojans also played on the United States Men’s National Team in international competition in 2013.
Christenson’s fellow Honolulu native Cassiday led the Trojans in digs this season with 297, posting a 2.97 dig per set average and providing a significant presence as a libero for the Trojans. Cassiday set a USC record this season with 17 matches with double-digit digs. This is the second All-America second team selection for the Punahou School graduate. Cassiday missed nine starts recovering from hip surgery in 2012, but came back strong and finished out the season as one of the best liberos in the nation.
San Clemente, Calif. native Lucas Yoder made a huge splash in his freshman campaign for USC. The outside hitter led the team in kills with 394 in 26 starts this season. He also posted an exceptional 4.02 kill per set average and was a huge part of the Trojans’ vaunted offensive attack in their 16-11 campaign.
Yoder and his cousin, redshirt junior outside hitter Paul Yoder, are part of a rather extensive dynasty of USC volleyball players. Lucas Yoder’s father, the late Dave Yoder, was a four-year starting outside hitter at USC. Yoder’s uncle, Bob Yoder, was a 1977 All-American who was also a  USC men’s volleyball head coach from 1982 to 1989.
Christenson, Cassiday and Yoder will be honored at the NCAA Men’s Volleyball Championship Banquet on April 30 at the site of the national championship tournament, Loyola University Chicago in Chicago.
What does this tell you about the coaching staff? A pitiful performance vs. BYU  with an extra week to prepare. So many hitting errors all season which has to fall sometimes on the setter. Where has all the recruiting gone since the days of Murphy Troy and Tony
Ciarelli?

When I first applied to USC in the fall of 2009, I figured I was applying to a school that would continue its athletic dominance — specifically in football — across my four years in college.
Pete Carroll was still the head football coach and a freshman phenom named Matt Barkley was showcasing the promise that had made him the top-ranked high school quarterback in the nation. The future looked bright for the Trojans — and to a certain aspiring sportswriter, that was a big factor in choosing what university to attend, no matter how irrational. I didn’t want to cover a mediocre team — I wanted to cover the best.
By the end of fall semester, one of my best friends decided to attend Alabama. I figured that if I got into USC, there was a fair possibility that our two schools would be competing for national championships against each other throughout our undergraduate years.
Needless to say, he’s had a lot more reason to talk smack over the past four years. While Alabama won two national championships, USC made it to two middle-tier bowl games and cycled through three head coaches.
But I wouldn’t trade my experiences as a USC fan and reporter for anything.
Though the Trojans generally underachieved while the class of 2014 made their way through USC, there have been some unforgettable moments that no other student body can lay claim to.
There’s been a fair amount of low points: getting trampled by Oregon in 2010 and 2012. Losing to Stanford in triple-overtime at home in 2011, then being upset by the Cardinal the following season while USC was ranked No. 2 in the nation. In fact, the entire 2012 season felt like one big emotional trench that ended with Barkley having his shoulder ripped out of its socket in the Rose Bowl.
But there have been glorious peaks, too: upsetting Oregon in Eugene in 2011 to ruin the Ducks’ national title hopes. Routing UCLA 50-0 two weeks later, with seemingly every undergrad in the student section bucking the norm by staying until after the final whistle to watch Barkley lead the crowd in what many thought would be his last game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. And, of course, beating Stanford last season and being able to do something that not even Alabama’s soon-to-be graduates can match: rushing the field.
Even when the Trojans didn’t come out on top, they’ve been involved in countless storylines that any journalist would be ecstatic to cover: the odd situation of being banned from postseason play. Starting out as the No. 1 ranked team in the nation upon being eligible for bowl games — then promptly crashing to a 7-6 record. And, of course, the rise and fall of Lane Kiffin.
USC fans hold a special kind of vitriol for Darth Visor, but I can’t bring myself to feel the same way.
His roller-coaster tenure was like a special kind of training for sports reporters. As I watched the Trojans lay down against Washington State to lose their first home game of 2013, I figured I’d have to write some post-mortem about the Kiffin era at some point during the season. But I didn’t think I’d be furiously crunching out my reaction column to his dismissal as I watched the sun rise from my hotel room in Tempe, Ariz., thanks to the infamous 4 a.m. press release that became necessary after Pat Haden couldn’t wait until a normal time of day to wash his hands of Kiffin.
Even the bad times were exhilarating -— that triple-overtime loss to Stanford remains the best sports atmosphere I’ve ever been a part of.
After coming across more fair-weather fans in Los Angeles in a year than I had the rest of my life, I wasn’t expecting USC fans to pack the Coliseum during a season that featured no tangible carrot at the end of the stick, with the Trojans banned from postseason play. But I was proven very, very wrong. And even though gleefully traveling to Pasadena with the expectation of upsetting the Bruins eventually became a miserable post-loss walk in the rain back to our cars (seriously, shape up your parking situation, Rose Bowl), getting the chance to witness one of the most heated collegiate rivalries from those historic stands is something I’ll never forget.
I remember seeing a tweet from a long-time college football reporter last fall revealing that he hadn’t sat in the stands for a game at his alma mater in 35-plus years. After having the privilege of attending USC the past four years, I’m sure I won’t be following in those precise footsteps. There’s no way I could stay away from the Coliseum bleachers for that long. There’s too many memories there that I’ll be revisiting for the rest of my days.

USC’s men’s tennis team is back on top.
After defeating crosstown rival UCLA last weekend, the Trojans (25-2, 7-0 Pac-12) earned the top seed in the Pac-12 Tournament and moved up to the No. 1 ranking in the nation.
Snap out of it · Senior co-captain Ray Sarmiento has gone 2-4 in Pac-12 play this season, but looks to improve his conference record this weekend. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In the match against No. 5 UCLA (20-3, 6-1), USC made a swift recovery from dropping the doubles point by coming out strong in singles.
Junior Yannick Hanfmann, currently ranked No. 13 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, knocked off UCLA’s No. 1 Clay Thompson in straight sets. The Trojans also got wins from juniors Eric Johnson and Roberto Quiroz as well as sophomore Max de Vroome in the 4-2 victory over the Bruins.
“Those four guys led us — Yannick, Roberto, Max and Eric,” said USC head coach Peter Smith. “To play in that kind of atmosphere against your big rival and rise to the occasion, you’ve got to feel good about that.”
With the resounding comeback victory, USC completed an undefeated Pac-12 run this season, earned the top seed in the conference tournament and extended its win streak to 16 consecutive matches.
The Trojans earned a first-round bye and will take on the No. 19 California Golden Bears today in the semifinals of the tournament. The Bears (15-6, 4-3) defeated Utah, 4-0, in Thursday’s quarterfinals to advance to the semifinals against USC.
Earlier this season, the Trojans hosted the Bears and pulled off an easy 4-0 victory behind impressive doubles play and wins in singles by senior co-captain Ray Sarmiento as well as Johnson and de Vroome.
Though Sarmiento played a key role in that victory, he has underperformed in conference matches this season. The Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native peaked at No. 3 in the national rankings in March, but a 2-4 record in Pac-12 play, including three losses to unranked players, has caused him to drop to No. 10.
Still, Smith has faith in the three-time All-American.
“He’s struggled as of late, but the one thing I know about Ray is when you least expect it, expect it,” Smith said. “He has a ton of experience, a ton of talent and he’s working hard.”
Despite Sarmiento’s losing record in Pac-12 singles competition, he and Hanfmann have ascended to the top spot in the national doubles rankings. The duo entered the season unranked in the national polls, but has won nine straight matches and put together a 13-1 record overall.
“We’re just communicating with each other and doing what works for the both of us,” Sarmiento said. “Our chemistry on court has definitely improved from last year, and we are just playing freely.”
Hanfmann and Sarmiento have an impressive supporting cast behind them, as Johnson and de Vroome have also lit up the doubles scene this season. Though they are unranked, the teammates have put together a 22-9 record, including a 15-4 mark in dual-match play.
Senior co-captain Michael Grant and freshman Nick Crystal are ranked No. 64 in the nation together despite no longer playing with each other. Crystal has played the last eight matches with Quiroz, with the pair going 7-1.
More impressive than his success in doubles is Quiroz’s singles play this season. Ranked No. 43 in the nation by the ITA, the Ecuador native has won 16 straight matches and has only lost one match since dual match play began in January.
By the numbers, the Trojans far outmatch their opponents today, with six ranked singles players and two ranked doubles teams.
Cal’s Ben McLachlan is the team’s only ranked singles player, sitting at No. 61 in the national polls. The Bears’ Gregory Bayane and Chase Melton are ranked No. 23 in doubles, while McLachlan and Andre Goransson are ranked No. 85.
Should the Trojans top the Bears for a second time this season, they would move into the finals, where they will likely face the Bruins again. After the team’s resounding victory against UCLA last Friday, Smith likes his team’s chances heading into the tournament.
“We can beat them again,” Smith said. “It’s funny, we got pushed against the wall, and we decided to come out punching. And that’s the attitude we have to have, even when we’re up … Just having that mindset of not waiting for anybody to give us anything, not being afraid of the situation.”
USC’s match against Cal kicks off today at noon in Ojai, Calif. The championship match will begin at 4 p.m. on Saturday.
Despite the fact that USC has already locked up a spot in the NCAA Tournament, which begins next month, Smith and his team are looking forward to playing this weekend.
“A lot of people would shy away from this match,” Smith said. “I know that what is good for us is adversity. It’s a little easier to turn off the alarm and roll over and snuggle under the covers, but if you want to be the best and you want to achieve the goals that we’ve set for ourselves, you’ve got to put yourself in a tough spot. So we look forward to it, and you’ve got to embrace it.”

With 24 regular season games in the books, it’s time for the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team to gear up for postseason play. Entering as the tournament’s third seed, the Women of Troy (22-2, 5-2) play host to the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament this weekend at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Final stand · Senior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist is entering her final MPSF Tournament with USC today. The Newport Beach, Calif. native, who serves as co-captain, has netted 137 goals in her four years at USC. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In the first round of tournament play, the Cardinal and Gold will square off with sixth-seeded Arizona State (14-8, 2-4) this afternoon. In the first two meetings with the Sun Devils, USC emerged victorious both times, outscoring its opponents from the desert 25-10 in total.
“We’re feeling good. We’re excited,” said senior two-meter and co-captain Kaleigh Gilchrist. “We’ve got some big games coming up, so it’s always exciting to see how we do. We need to start off Friday against ASU, so we’re looking forward to that.”
In the most recent meeting between the two squads, both junior driver Monica Vavic and freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis led nine USC scorers with a pair of hat tricks. Senior goalie Flora Bolonyai registered seven saves in the victory.
Bolonyai enters the weekend tied with Bernice Orwig for most saves in USC program history with 838. The Hungarian has been the Women of Troy’s starting goaltender for the past four years under head coach Jovan Vavic.
Should USC claim a third win over ASU, the team will advance to the semifinal round Saturday against the winner of a No. 2 UCLA and CSU Bakersfield first round matchup.
In two meetings with CSU Bakersfield earlier in the season, the Women of Troy displayed their offensive dominance in capturing the wins.
In the first meeting, the team demolished the Roadrunners by a 21-1 score. Time did not change much for CSU’s fate, as the two squads met again with USC claiming an impressive 22-7 victory.
Unfortunately for the Women of Troy, their season series with the Bruins has not been as easy.
When the two teams met for the first time earlier this season, USC was able to claim the UCI Invitational crown in a 7-6 overtime thriller. Junior two-meter Eike Daube played hero in the late-February match, recording the Women of Troy’s only two goals in the extra period to solidify the win.
In last week’s regular season finale against the Bruins, the Cardinal and Gold were held to a season-low four goals en route to their lone home loss this year, dropping the game 6-4.
“It’s postseason,” Gilchrist said. “You only have three weeks of the season left and this is for the seeding in the NCAAs. We want to have some revenge on the teams we lost to earlier in the season so it will be interesting. It will be a lot of fun, too.”
USC could potentially face No. 1 Stanford in the finals for the second straight year. Last year, the Women of Troy captured the program’s third MPSF title with an 11-7 victory over the top-seeded Cardinal. Just like last season, USC will be looking to avenge a regular-season loss during the matchup.
In the season’s lone meeting between the two teams, the Cardinal snapped the Women of Troy’s 27-game winning streak in a 9-5 upset in Palo Alto, Calif. Senior two-meter Colleen O’Donnell recorded a team-high two goals in the defeat.
“The game that happened earlier in the season was the first game against Stanford,” Daube said. “We came in with an open mind and didn’t really know what to expect. I think we are going to be a lot more prepared this time, and as the season goes on everyone gets better, so I think that it will be a good game no matter what.”
USC will put months of exhausting training, tiring practices and gruesome battles on the line this weekend. The Women of Troy begin their postseason campaign today against Arizona State at Uytengsu Aquatic Center at 12:30 p.m.

Privacy has become a thing of the past with the onset of social media. With every tweet, Instagram post and Facebook check-in, we invite fellow social media users to know more about our lives. But even with the multitude of social media features, there must be limits.
Design by Mollie Berg and Julien Nicolai
 
Such limits were crossed Monday when Facebook announced its new mobile feature, “Nearby Friends,” which enables users to track each other’s location in real time using mobile GPS tracking, according to CNN. The idea, envisioned to make it easier for friends to meet in person, essentially allows users to opt in to live-tracking, in which they turn on the feature and give Facebook permission to share their general location with an audience as broad as all of their Facebook friends or as selective as a customized list of friend who are also using the feature. Once users opt in, they will start receiving push notifications telling them how many of their friends are nearby, including distance and time stamps of when friends were in a certain location.
Unlike the usual “check in” option on social media apps in which users can opt to share their location, however, the Nearby Friends feature isn’t discerning. With the new feature, the days of simply sharing your location at a particular restaurant, venue or monument will be long gone. With Nearby Friends, everywhere you go — Starbucks, your doctor’s office, even somewhere as private as your residence — will be continuously tracked. What’s more, the Facebook app will continue to build a history of your locations even when the app is not in use or closed, according to Tech Crunch.
Though it’s possible for users to delete individual locations from one’s history, or clear the entire queue, the fact of the matter is that the app will continue to gather data. This isn’t just a creepy problem — it’s a security problem. One only has to look back into this past year alone to see the sheer number of websites — from Twitter to CNN — that have been hacked or compromised in some way. Sure, some people might not mind if the Facebook app knows their constant whereabouts, but what about complete strangers? The fact is that such sites, Facebook included, are not immune to security breaches.
The security concerns behind the feature aren’t the only problem — it’s the message that comes with it. According to Facebook, “Nearby Friends helps you discover which friends are nearby or on the go.” Though no one can question Facebook’s good intentions, the idea of fostering real-time meetings through social media tells users that the new way to spend time with your friends is by following their every move. How can someone opt out of hanging out with someone if their whereabouts are already known? If anything, this new feature could lead to more awkward situations than social interactions. Should one go to a coffee shop, the gym or a library, it shouldn’t be assumed that they want to spend time with others.
Social media is, by its very nature, impersonal. Though it manages to bring people together from far and wide, it has its limits — as it should. Though we individually may opt to share parts of our lives with our Facebook friends, from photos to relationships and everything in between, GPS coordinates should not be part of it. Fostering more real-time interaction between people is a lofty goal, but there are better ways of doing it.

These days, one of the biggest complaints about social media revolves around its effects on the state of our social and communication skills. Yet with the new Facebook feature “Nearby Friends,” things are looking up for face-to-face — rather than face-to-screen — conversation.
Design by Mollie Berg and Julien Nicolai
 
Announced Monday, Nearby Friends is a location tracker app that allows Facebook friends to share their locations with one another without having to manually check in. Though not unprecedented, this app is a major step forward in facilitating more face-to-face interaction through social media.
Social media is booming among youth, but talking still beats texting. After all, memorable moments mostly happen in-person. With this location app, grabbing a cup of coffee or meeting up with a friend who’s usually not in the area will be easy. “Likes” and “LOLs” will be replaced by actual laughter and eye contact.
“You’ll be able to see the city or neighborhood they are in, included on their profile. When you see a friend visiting a place you’ve been, it’s the perfect opportunity to send a recommendation for a great restaurant,” Product Manager Andrea Vaccari said in a statement.
Once users turn on Nearby Friends, the feature will run use the phone’s GPS capabilities, broadcast a user’s location to other Facebook friends, according to the Facebook newsroom.
Despite being a great idea at its core, many critics are quick to dismiss this as just another invasion of privacy.
“Now Facebook wants to make sure that you keep your GPS humming so your location can be tracked all the time,” a News.com writer said. “If I know where you are, what you had for dinner and at what restaurant, whether you are in your car or on foot, where you work and where you live, I have some really potent information that I can, and certainly will, exploit to the fullest.” He went on to describe the app as a “haven for crooks, criminals and psychos.”
Though a little skepticism is always healthy, such concerns are a little over-the-top and paranoid. With an opt-in or out button, Nearby Friends isn’t “on” by default. Instead, it’s fairly buried under the submenu of the Facebook app, so there shouldn’t be concerns over being tracked around all day and all night. According to the Facebook newsroom, sharing locations is a two-way agreement as well — both parties must turn on the app and choose to share with one another.
Even if it is turned on, Nearby Friends won’t share an exact location — just roughly how far from the user the friend is. There is also an option to show the specific location only for a fixed amount of time with only certain friends, a convenient thing to do before meetings. Creeper-status stalking also seems to pose a problem at first glance, but location is only shared with a customized list of people that the user feels most comfortable with.
Though bringing people together via social media isn’t a novel concept, similar programs such as Glancee have not enjoyed considerable success because such apps were based on the idea of meeting new people, rather than connecting with people who we already know.
As with all things, users must be wary while embracing the many advantages to enjoy the best of both worlds. Nearby Friends makes this easier by giving control to the users. It equips them with the tools to adjust the app to their own comfort, an aspect that is key to app success.

The Annenberg Innovation Lab hosted an Evening of Innovation at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Wednesday. Six student-founded startups partook in the event for an opportunity to receive $10,000 in funding.
Erin Reilly, Annenberg Innovation Lab creative director, described the Evening of Innovation as a culmination of the 2013-2014 academic year.
“It’s a program that really is to celebrate all the hard work that students and faculty and staff here at the Innovation Lab have been developing throughout the year,” Reilly said.
College Knowledge LA, RePlant LA, Snap Basket, Spheretec, Trail and XCLU were the  startups chosen to participate. Each team pitched its concept to a small audience of USC students, faculty and industry professionals.
The student-founders came from various schools within USC, including the Marshall School of Business, Rossier School of Education and Viterbi School of Engineering. These diverse areas of expertise showed through in each group’s presentation.
Trail, an event discovery platform, started off the evening. The mobile application creates an “event maven network,” where people can connect with others who share similar interests.
Users filter their feed based on event time and topic, designing a personalized search process.
“You’re only following trails of people and organizations that you’re interested in,” said Sam Sagartz, Trail president and co-founder.
Second to present, Spheretec is a disposable electronic wristband that allows people to effortlessly exchange contact information. The wristband records the names and faces of people that users shake hands with.
After removing the technology, users review the people they met and gain access to additional contact details.
College Knowledge LA, RePlant LA and Snap Basket combine community outreach with technological innovation.
College Knowledge LA, founded by Sharla Berry, Vanessa Monterosa and Christopher Perez, aims to simplify the college admission process for low-income students. The mobile app connects Los Angeles high school students to local resources and events, providing access to practical knowledge and mentorship.
Monterosa, the organization’s executive director, said that her team’s personal experiences inspired the idea.
“All three of us came from a background where we didn’t have very many role models to get to college,” Monterosa said. “We know that students today still face the same obstacles, so we wanted to create an access point, an opportunity to reach out to students.”
RePlant LA also focuses on enriching adolescents’ lives, teaching them to adopt pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Through a unique trans-media platform, children take direct responsibility over the life of a plant that corresponds with the life of a fictional character.
“Our goal is to build a story world that encourages the children to engage with the plants,” said Sonia Guggenheim, co-founder of RePlan tLA.
Catherine Peiper, co-founder of Snap Basket, also drew from personal experiences to start her company. The web-based application provides low-income individuals with real-time, location-based grocery pricing information.
“This was inspired in part because I spent a couple of years on food stamps, and I realized how difficult it was to buy food when you have such a limited budget,” Peiper said.
Following the five-minute pitches, guests voted for their favorite startups. People were encouraged to evaluate each work based on presentation, innovativeness, design, interdisciplinarity and potential for cultural and social impact.
XCLU, a mobile app for independent creatives to create multimedia content through live-streaming, received the most votes.
By providing an inexpensive platform for users to independently produce and monetize content, XCLU aims to foster new talent. As winner of the Evening of Innovation, XCLU will receive continued mentorship and support from the Annenberg Innovation Lab.
