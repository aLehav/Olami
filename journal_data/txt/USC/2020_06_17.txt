Black USC student-athletes have created the United Black Student-Athletes Association to foster a community for Black student-athletes, provide a safe space and offer a platform to advocate for action against anti-Blackness at the University and in the Athletic Department.
Senior track and field hurdler and sprinter Anna Cockrell emailed a statement detailing the newly formed group’s calls to action to athletic director Mike Bohn and later posted the statement in a tweet Wednesday morning. 
“Given our unique position and platforms as athletes at a prestigious university, we cannot remain silent on these issues,” the statement read. “We are not student-athletes who happen to be Black, but Black students who happen to be athletes. We are hurting, and we feel compelled to make a statement and urge USC and USC Athletics to take bold, decisive action to combat racial inequality and support Black students.”
The statement outlined 12 specific changes UBSAA wishes to see from the Athletic Department by the beginning of the fall semester. Those demands, which UBSAA says are not exhaustive, are for the Athletic Department to:
— State unequivocally that Black lives matter and prioritize Black lives and well-being over “pandering to boosters and donors.” 
— Promise that student-athletes will not face retaliation or punishment for protesting or speaking out against racial injustice. This means no reduction in playing time or financial aid, no suspensions and no removal from their respective teams.
— Include student-athletes in ongoing dialogue about the coronavirus pandemic and the return to campus, especially because of the pandemic’s disproportionate effects on the Black community. The statement claims that a survey about student-athletes’ well-being has been the sole platform for student-athletes to speak out on the topic. 
— Improve inclusivity and representation on the Trojan Athletic Senate. According to the statement, TAS meetings are poorly communicated and dominated by certain unspecified teams. 
— Work toward diversity among Athletic Department staff and consider Black candidates for open positions, especially in the Sports Psychology and Athletic Medicine departments. The statement said that the pandemic and recent publicly broadcasted killings of Black people create a need for psychological support more than ever before and that Black psychologists who can relate to the Black experience are essential. 
— Create a pipeline to train and facilitate the hiring of Black staff. The statement suggested career development outreach for current Black staff members and a diversity and inclusion fellowship for student-athletes who remain at USC but are out of athletic eligibility. 
— Encourage donations by fans, particularly by maintaining dialogue with UBSAA, Black student-athlete alumni, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the Black Student Assembly to determine outreach methods. 
— Require in-person anti-racism training for all student-athletes and staff, an extension of the mandatory online training that President Carol Folt announced USC will implement for the community. 
— Follow the NCAA Board of Governors’ Friday recommendation by mandating that no required athletic activities take place on election days. 
— Hold celebrations and special events in recognition of Black History Month. UBSAA suggested the monthlong observance include speakers, panels, presentations and food. 
— Fund at least two student-athletes and an adviser or staff member to attend the Black Student-Athlete Summit each year so student-athletes can “form bonds with students from different schools, discuss culturally relevant topics, and learn best practices in use at other schools and potentially implement them at USC.”
— Create a graduate scholarship for student-athletes who have completed their eligibility and devoted significant work to the improvement of the Black community. In addition, work with the Black Alumni Association and CBCSA to fund scholarships for Black students who are not athletes.  
The statement said the organization was formed to improve the experiences of the Black community both at USC and in the outside community amid ongoing nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. According to the statement, UBSAA has already created a voter registration and information drive, a podcast series and community service events it can host after returning to campus. 
The statement also announced UBSAA’s endorsement of BSA’s call to action made in early June.
USC Athletics has taken to social media in the past weeks to voice support for the Black community and removed a football booster due to racist tweets two weeks ago. The statement acknowledged the efforts made by the University and its athletic department so far but added that there remains work to be done. 
“It is not enough for the athletic department to release public statements and post on social media,” the statement read. “They must support their words with sustained action and commitment to the Black community.”
In response to Cockrell’s tweet containing the statement, Bohn announced the creation of the USC Athletics Black Lives Matter Action Team in a statement on his Twitter.
“The charge of this group will be to lead our program through a process of continued listening, learning, and educating with the ultimate goal of developing a series of meaningful and substantive actions and reforms for implementation,” Bohn’s statement read. “Our intention is not to take the first action, but rather to take the actions that will deliver sustained, long-term impact and progress.” 
Bohn wrote that the USCABLM Action Team will work with student-athletes, including the TAS and UBSAA, to ensure that all voices are heard and that actions taken reflect collaboration and shared goals.
Bohn’s statement also recognized the demands made by UBSAA. He did not yet comment on whether or not UBSAA’s requested actions would be taken.
“I enthusiastically encourage our students to use their platforms to effect change, and we are excited to work together — student-athletes, coaches, and staff — to make [a] real and meaningful impact,” Bohn wrote. “We all share the same commitment to building an inclusive athletics program that provides our student-athletes with a safe and supportive environment.”

In response to the Black Lives Matter movement and recent protests against police brutality, several student organizations have bolstered their advocacy for the Black community by sharing educational resources, collecting donations for Black nonprofits and providing opportunities for students to voice their concerns about USC’s racial injust against its Black community.
But increased advocacy efforts have also resulted from the lack of definitive actions from the administration to combat what students allege is unequal treatment from the Department of Public Safety and other University divisions.
Two weeks following the creation of their petition that has since amassed 2,000 more signatures to total more than 7,000 at the time of publication, rising senior Jephtha Prempeh updated the letter, calling out the University for its failure to “take a clear stand against antiblackness” and promote resources on social media involving the Black Lives Matter movement.
“USC can set an example for universities across the country in that no matter how wide the gap between administration and individual, the voices of the students must be heard,” the petition read. “WE ARE A COMMUNITY, NOT A BUSINESS!” 
In the wake of the petition and various other student advocacy efforts, President Carol Folt, in a letter to the community June 11, announced six preliminary anti-racism actions, including the renaming of the former Von KleinSmid Center. 
“This moment is our Call to Action, a call to confront anti-Blackness and systemic racism, and unite as a diverse, equal, and inclusive university,” the email read. “You have asked for actions, not rhetoric, and actions, now.”
The Undergraduate Student Government issued a statement praising the renaming of the interim Center for International and Public Affairs, previously called the Von KleinSmid Center after former USC president and known eugenicist Rufus von KleinSmid. USG has also compiled an online database of contact information for resources such as the Office of Equity and Diversity, bail funds and virtual therapy.
“USG has done a great job of really combining those resources, putting it all in one place, making sure people know where to go,” said USG Sen. Lennon Wesley III, a rising junior majoring in business administration and philosophy, politics and law.
Wesley worked with Sen. Trinity Moore to develop the USC Diversity and Equity Climate Survey, released by USG earlier this month. The questionnaire comprises 13 questions about the racial climate and diversity on campus and is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.
“We wanted the questions to unearth students’ feelings about areas for growth in terms of equity in the USC community,” said Moore, a rising junior majoring in business of cinematic arts. “Basically, all the questions are formulated to be a platform where uncomfortable conversations, topics and experiences surrounding race could be comfortably examined.”
The survey currently has no set end date and as of Tuesday had accrued more than 250 responses of its 500- to 600-response goal. USG senators will reference the results of the survey throughout the year when proposing and passing resolutions to better understand the diverse needs of the student body.
Several of the survey respondents identified a need to forge a better connection between DPS and the USC community, Wesley said. To that end, USG has begun working with DPS to plan events where students can converse with DPS officers.
“One thing we want to do with DPS is have them engage with us in some consistent, periodical forums in which students can interact with them, share their experiences, and DPS administration can interact with the students and share how they go about their jobs and their lives, and we can both be on the same page,” Wesley said.
The Black Student Assembly has also been working to improve the relationship between DPS and Black students, who BSA Assistant Director Justin Powell said are profiled by campus law enforcement. Powell said by strengthening the connection between the student body and DPS employees, BSA hopes to make USC a safer campus for Black students. 
However, other organizations have instead asked the University to decrease DPS funding and dissociate from local law enforcement agencies. 
Inspired by an open letter from UCLA students to its administration, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation created a petition calling on USC administrators to sever the University’s relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department, to defund DPS and to reinvest funds in underserved communities on campus, particularly Black organizations. Since its launch June 8, the petition has garnered more than 1,800 signatures from students, faculty and community members.
“This marginalization of Black people persists violently in our own USC community,” the petition read. “USC plays a large role in the gentrification of the South Central region of Los Angeles. Its expansion rapidly consumes local property, hiking up the cost of living for the area which adversely forces its longtime Black and Brown residents to vacate.”
A SCALE representative did not respond in time for publication to elaborate on the petition.
The Latinx Student Assembly also supports cutting funding for DPS, citing in an open letter to the University administration an alleged pattern of misconduct by its officials.
“There are many testimonies of DPS officers using intimidation and violence to harass youth around campus,” read the letter, which LSA posted to its social media last week. “Increased levels of security have, in turn, increased the profiling of lower-income youth of color. Black USC students are continuously profiled and harassed by both DPS and the LAPD.”
LSA co-executive director Valeria Ortiz, a rising senior majoring in international relations, said that while the policing issues described in the organization’s statement are not exclusive to USC and DPS, she believes the University must take action to remedy them on campus through budget reallocation in order to show its support for its Black population.
“The organizers on the ground have made it very clear that the movement is very anti-capitalist and anti-police,” Ortiz said. “If the school wants to truly stand with its Black students, stand with its Black administrators, its Black service workers, etc., there needs to be a recognition that police presence on our campus has been in the past and will continue to be in the future a detriment to the students.”
Organizations such as the Pan African Student Association and IDEAS at USC have dedicated their time to providing resources — the former creating a split donation fundraiser in collaboration with USC Delta Phi Epsilon for Black organizations such as the Black Visions Collective and the NAACP. In a solidarity post to its social media account, IDEAS created a guide for undocumented protesters and called attention to the vulnerability of the Black immigrant experience.
The USC Care Collective, an effort founded in Spring 2020 to increase underserved students’ access to crucial resources and community support, has also advocated on behalf of the Black community. The Care Collective has added a “Create Change” page to its website encouraging students to sign petitions and contact legislators to voice their opinions about recent police killings, along with several books about race relations on the Care Collective’s radical reading list.
“In addition to all of our COVID resources, petitions, links to pro-Black movements, organizations, coalitions, fundraisers that are in dire need of support have also been added,” said Care Collective co-founder Alexia Sambrano, a rising junior majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science. “We’ve also continuously been adding more books, documentaries, movies, series or podcasts to our radical reading list.”
Since its founding, the Care Collective has offered financial assistance to students in need through the organization’s GoFundMe. Assistance recipients can now choose to divert the funds to a pro-Black or anti-police organization. The Care Collective has raised approximately $250 to date through this option, according to Sambrano.
“Obviously, we’re not requiring the students to donate them — the GoFundMe was created from marginalized communities that need these funds, especially amid COVID, so we completely understand if they choose not to donate,” Sambrano said. “But I think it speaks a lot and says a lot about how large the amount of people who have been able to donate or who have been willing to donate despite their circumstances.”
BSA has also expanded its efforts to advocate for the community outside USC and launched a fundraiser this week to amass resources for the surrounding South Central neighborhood. The organization also helped plan a Black Lives Matter protest, alongside recent graduate Kabwasa Green, which took place earlier this month and saw 1,000 students and community members demonstrate against police brutality.
During the Black Lives Matter demonstration, USC’s official social media highlighted the event but failed to appropriately credit the organizers of the protest, Powell said. However, BSA members have discussed ways to improve future media publicity with University staff.
“We think that how USC is going to handle protest coverage and coverage of the [Black Lives Matter] movement in general is going to be really good and progressive for Black students moving into the future,” Powell said.
Although most fall programming remains on hold as student organizations await official word from the University administration regarding social distancing protocol at events, BSA has proposed a campuswide discussion co-sponsored by USG focusing on allyship.
While the Care Collective has not penned a letter to the University administration enumerating specific demands for change, Sambrano said she hopes the University releases a more thorough and genuine response reiterating its support for the nationwide Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
“I would really, really love to see the University or administration put out an official statement about the movement,” Sambrano said. “I know we had that email from President Folt not so long ago, but it kind of seemed very performative and lackluster.”
Prempeh, who has met with Folt twice, said they believe Folt has done well in listening to students and responding to their requests for change but sees room for growth with regard to the accessibility of USC’s administrators.
“I think a lot of people feel intimidated by reaching out to higher administration and I think it’s hard to know how we’re going to know we’re being supported,” Prempeh said. “I do think that in terms of having [Folt’s] attention, she has been and will continue to be a constructive resource for us.”

Andy Rutkowski found himself on a deserted campus right before spring break. With classes temporarily moving online, students who would usually be studying for midterms in Doheny Memorial Library’s ornate halls and lugging their bags across campus, getting ready to leave for spring break, were nowhere to be seen. As Rutkowski, a visualization librarian, continued to visit the empty library with a few of his colleagues, he reflected upon the new normal; when USC transitioned online for the rest of the semester, he thought of the idea to create a space where the University community could come together to share their stories. 
“The campus is usually abuzz right before spring break … all of a sudden it just switched to emptying out and being so quiet and it felt like a time to reflect, and it felt like a time to gather some thoughts and start sharing them,” Rutkowski said. 
Rutkowski, along with his colleagues in Special Collections and University Archives, launched the #StayAtHome project in early April to gather the experiences of the USC and South Central communities as they adapted to remote working and staying indoors during the pandemic. 
“When the pandemic started to arise and we started to feel the effects of this, people were asking ‘Has USC gone through something like this before?’” said Claude Zachary, a University archivist who helped jumpstart the project. “I realized the event that we’re going through is a once-in-a-lifetime — once-in-a-century-type situation, and it’s really important to try and document as best I can the effect that this has had on our community.”
Initially, the project focused on collecting USC voices, but it expanded to preserve stories of the broader L.A. and Southern California area, with the city playing a significant role in the University’s history. 
“Given the deep connections between the University and the city and the community, [their stories were] something that we didn’t want to leave out,” said Hugh McHarg, associate dean for strategic initiatives, who helped coordinate across library units to keep library priorities like regional history in mind. “If we had the capacity to preserve some of [these] stories to add to the history of the University and complement the history of our current experiences as a campus, we didn’t want to leave [them] out.”
Participants are able to submit material via an online form, in person or through mail as journals, blogs, photos, videos, social media posts and audio files. Submissions can also be in other languages, with the team currently working on translating the form into Spanish. The submission form also provides a list of suggested prompts for both the USC and L.A. communities for what their material can include such as “How has your campus involvement changed?” and “How do you keep in touch with friends and family?”
“The idea is to create a real rich body of documentation that illuminates people’s experience during this era of stay-at-home,” Zachary said. “A body of documentation that people could look at and come back to and reflect upon and hopefully help historians in the future have really firsthand experiences, [to] build an accurate and rich history.”
Participants also have the option to provide their general location to contribute to a virtual map — an idea spearheaded by Rutkowski after previously working on a mapping system as part of a microseminar and wanting to show the diverse range of places USC students were working from after returning home.   
Wayne Shoaf, a metadata and digital librarian working on the #StayatHome project, decided to submit a letter he had written to his 98-year-old father — a personal piece about his life during the early stages of the pandemic. Through the letter, Shoaf wanted to tell his father the changes California’s stay-at-home period had on his daily routine working from home. He included a story about his experience visiting a grocery store where he and his wife were carded for their age before getting early access as citizens older than 65 years old.
“My basic idea in writing the letter to my father was that, first of all, he’s quite old,” Shoaf said. “He’s not as sharp as he used to be and I’m not real sure how much he really understands what’s going on around him, so I needed to put things into terms that he could sort of understand.”
Documenting his experience also helped Shoaf come up with the framework of questions people might be uncomfortable answering in their submissions and created the suggested prompts list. An anonymous feature was also added to allow people to share personal stories without having to identify themselves.  
Shoaf also said reading about other people’s experiences working from home and the negative impacts on their life, such as financial issues, helped him realize his own privilege and think about the different ways people were affected by the pandemic.
“It’s been really reassuring to hear other people tell stories that are similar to mine so that I know that I’m not really the only one experiencing things the way that I’m experiencing,” Shoaf said. “Also to recognize that many more people have it more difficult than I do and I’m actually in a very lucky situation.”
To promote the project, Suzanne Noruschat, Southern California studies specialist at USC Libraries who collected submissions from the L.A. and South Central communities, said the team advertised the project through social media and the electronic mailing lists of organizations like L.A. as Subject, a research alliance that preserves and improves access to archival material of L.A.’s history. Rutkowski also reached out to students in an undergraduate writing course, introducing the project as an opportunity to reflect on the semester and share their personal stories with the USC community. 
After Rutkowski introduced the #StayatHome project to her writing class, Qufei Wang decided to submit her experience as a graduating senior who was unable to say goodbye to her friends. In her submission, Wang also described the uncertainty and worry she faced with family back in China as coronavirus cases began to escalate in L.A., leading her to cancel her spring break travel plans to Hawaii.
Wang also said the project will allow the University administration to hear student voices and understand how they are dealing with online classes in order to create improvements and better resources in preparation of a potential future crisis.
“It’s good to know that there’s a way to record what people are going through,” Wang said. “You’re able to see the thoughts … [of] people who might share the same experience, who might resonate with you, [who] can also see what you experienced, what you would do.” 
Noruschat said that along with collecting historical material, libraries were becoming more interested in documenting people’s personal accounts of life-changing events that would be of interest to researchers in the future. A previous project conducted by Special Collections had highlighted other significant events, such as the first L.A. Women’s March in 2017 — an event which has been documented each year via submissions of signs and clothing items from those who attend. 
“This is a way to document history as it’s happening and to document it directly from the voices of people who are experiencing it,” Noruschat said. “I’m hoping that these materials will provide interesting and very vital and important documentation that [USC students, faculty and researchers] can access to discover and grapple with ‘What was this event? What and how were people experiencing this event?’ It could lead, in classrooms, for instance, to all kinds of interesting engagements with these materials.”
Shoaf said recent events and protests for Black Lives Matter had also prompted a discussion among the librarians to create another project to document protest stories, but nothing has been decided upon officially at the time of publication. 
As community members continue to submit materials to the project, Zachary said the library would keep documenting stories to provide a collection of diverse experiences during the crisis as long as the pandemic continues affecting people’s lives. 
“It’s become a common [phrase] for people to say ‘We’re all in this pandemic together’ — which, in some respect, is true. It is a global event,” McHarg said. “On the other hand, we’re not all experiencing it the same way, and it’s important to make sure that as an institution … we are collecting as diverse and inclusive set of stories as we can.”
