Around 50 students gathered at Tommy Trojan Thursday evening to address their concerns about police brutality and racism following the officer-involved shooting death of Stephon “Zoe” Clark in Sacramento.

The event was hosted by ANSWER Coalition, a national organization dedicated to fighting racism, and supported by various campus organizations, including  the Black Student Assembly and the Young Democratic Socialists of America at USC. 
“[Clark] was shot at 20 times and eight of them hit him, six of which hit his back,” said Kameron Hurt, an organizer with the ANSWER Coalition. “It was a very grotesque and brutal murder that is inspiring people across the country and we’re just one drop in the rain storm that’s happening against this injustice that seems to never end.” 
On March 18, officers believed that Clark had used a “toolbar” to break a window into a resident’s house. Once officers were dispatched, they pursued Clark and shot him in his grandmother’s backyard, saying they believed he was carrying a firearm. Clark was carrying a cellphone.
Many who disagreed with the officers’ use of force took to social media to express their frustration. In 2018 so far, 289 people have been shot and killed by police, according to the Washington Post.
Jacob Pettis, a freshman majoring in African American studies, kicked off the rally by passing out signs with “#justiceforzoe” written on them, and leading chants with phrases such as “No justice, no peace! No racist police” and “When Trump says get back, we say fight back.” 
“I encourage others to stand up and speak out as well because I feel like a lot of times with these rallies, people are too afraid to speak out,” Pettis said. “They’ll come to support in numbers but they won’t really have the courage to speak up and give a speech.”
Former Undergraduate Student Government Senator Preston Fregia and Julia Wallace, a local activist who formerly served on the South Central Neighborhood Council, also spoke at the rally.
“Stephon Clark is one of the many people that have become [just] names to us,” Wallace said in her speech. “They were taken down by the police … They’re taking us out and counting on us to be afraid of them and intimidated by them. The fact that we’re here shows how we’re unafraid and willing to go against them.” 
Many of the speakers discussed inequality present on campus, from racial profiling by DPS and LAPD to how tuition increases hinder low-income students’ access to higher education. 
“This is just the beginning,” Fregia said. “It will get much worse. The fighting against racism is almost apparent in humanity to dominate one another. I think right now, what we can do in this moment, is to challenge ourselves to have that moral awakening that we will all fundamentally change the human experience.”
Toward the end of the rally, Hurt invited audience members to share their experiences with police harassment or racial profiling, and explain why they attended the rally. 
“If you think about the Black Panthers and if you think about Harriet Tubman, many of those people didn’t have many titles behind their name,” Wallace said in her speech. “Yet, they made a change and decided that they were no longer going to tolerate it. We can decide right now, tonight that we’re going to say no more. We’re going to end it and end it for good.”

To expand its reach to students on campus, the Vietnamese Student Association hosted its inaugural Vietnamese Heritage Week from Monday through Friday this week.
The Vietnamese Student Association hosted its inaugural Vietnamese Heritage Week. Wanting He | Daily Trojan
The organization coordinated events highlighting a different aspect of the Vietnamese culture, including beauty and films.
“By having one event everyday, hopefully we can reach a lot of people and hopefully people who haven’t come out to our event before might come to learn something [and] enjoy all the free stuff we have,” VSA senior adviser Allison Mai said.
The week kicked off on April 2 with a photo campaign. VSA encouraged students to take photos with a sign that read: “I love Vietnamese culture because…”
According to Vietnamese Culture Night Director Nathan Vo, the varied responses demonstrated how differently Vietnamese culture can be experienced for each individual.
“Some people [said], ‘I love Vietnamese culture because I love my mom’s food,’” Vo said. “I said, ‘I love Vietnamese culture because it represents resilience and strength,’ because of the whole refugee experience that many refugees have gone through after the Vietnamese War.”
According to Mai, the events provide entertaining and educational experiences to learn about the history behind Vietnamese traditions through activities involving cuisine, fashion and games. Mai was specifically in charge of the Fashion and Beauty event in Taper Hall on Tuesday.
“There are a few main points that we [covered included] how Vietnamese culture has evolved over time, how these styles have been represented by Vietnamese immigrants in the U.S. and how Vietnamese Americans have influenced the beauty industry, like the nail salon industry,” Mai said.
Another event on Wednesday featured traditional Vietnamese games.
“I grew up playing these different traditional games with my parents, cousins and extended family … so I think it is really cool to share these games with people,” Vo said. “Especially those who have never played them before. So you can show them what you grew up with.”
Vo said that he is optimistic about the benefits and accessibility to Vietnamese culture that Heritage Week brings to both the organization and all USC students. 
“[Heritage Week] is a lot of work,” Vo said. “But I think it is really beneficial to not just for the club, but for the USC student body in general to get a taste of Vietnamese culture … a culture of perseverance and never giving up.”

The USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy announced to its students that musician William Adams, known by his stage name will.i.am, will be the speaker of the school’s first-ever commencement ceremony May 11. 
“Will.i.am personifies the spirit of cross-disciplinary innovation and creativity, which is the essence of the Academy,” IYA Dean Erica Muhl said in an email media release.
Adams is known for being a founding member of the hip-hop group The Black Eyed Peas. Adams immersed himself into technology as an entrepreneur for companies ranging from consumer electronics to fashion accessories, according to the IYA email.
Adams’ technology company i.am+ uses artificial intelligence and smarter consumer products and sells wireless earbuds. He has also helped found ill.i Optics, which focuses on eyewear with a contemporary aesthetic. 
Along with being a musician, Adams has also partnered with several companies like The Coca-Cola Company, Amuse and BEATS. In 2009, he founded the i.am.angel Foundation, which provides scholarships to college students. 
“Our inaugural graduates are trailblazers who, through courage and audacity, breathed life into this revolutionary new program,” Muhl wrote.

Students living in some USC Housing buildings were informed that some washers and dryers were offline and not functioning Thursday morning.
An initial email from the Century Customer Service Center said all University washers and dryers were offline. Later that day, however, the Parkside Arts and Humanities CSC advised students to use the laundry room in the Parkside International Residential College. 
The Century CSC email said the machines’ owner and operator Wash Laundry Systems was having internal server issues. Although the machines are functional, they are unable to take card payments. 
USC Housing told its residents that it is working to solve the problem. USC Housing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“This problem has been reported to USC Housing Maintenance and we will have to wait until someone comes to take a look at the problem and fixes it,” the email read. 
Jillian Pih, a freshman living at Parkside, said she was frustrated with the system shutdown.
“It’s a huge inconvenience as I have to walk to another residential college to do something as simple as my laundry,” Pih said. 
It is unknown at this time when the washers and dryers will be restored.
