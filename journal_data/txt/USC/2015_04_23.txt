Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his international work and exhausted efforts as an environmental activist and New York district attorney, spoke to USC students, faculty and alumni on Thursday evening at Town & Gown about the importance of the United States’ responsibility to utilize energy and natural resources in a way that promotes the quality of life for future generations.
During the discussion, Kennedy tied economic policy and environmental initiatives together, explaining that environmental prosperity can be directly traced to economic policy.
The event was hosted by Visions and Voices, and co-sponsored by the Environmental Student Assembly and USC Sustainability.
Daria Yudacufski, executive director of Visions and Voices, welcomed Kennedy on stage, calling him an international model for his achievements.
Kennedy, known for his global work on environmental issues — in particular, aiding indigenous tribes in Latin America and Canada — has been recognized by environmentalists as a staunch protector of traditional homelands. His movement toward the passage of the New York City Watershed Agreement was noted by Yudacufski as an international model in consensus negotiations for sustainable practices. In 2004, he was named by TIME magazine as one of the greatest “Heroes for the Planet” for providing aid toward the restoration of the Hudson River. In 1998, Kennedy co-founded Waterkeeper Alliance, a global movement uniting more than 250 Waterkeeper organizations around the world and focusing citizen advocacy on issues that affect waterways, from pollution to climate change. He currently serves as the senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel and is a chief prosecuting attorney for Hudson Riverkeeper.
Kennedy began his speech by explaining the importance of restoring and maintaining natural resources. He said America’s future generations would be protected by creating a world with shared resources that cannot be reduced by private property management.
“You cannot have a clean environment unless you have a functioning democracy,” he said. “The two go together … Anywhere you see tyranny, you will also see environmental destruction. Democracy is the only thing that can protect the environment and we need to restore our democracy in our country. The biggest threat to democracy today is corporate power.”
Furthermore, he compared the levels of mercury found in fresh water fish from local polluted rivers, lakes and streams to a science-fiction nightmare. This nightmare, he explained, is due to the exhausted efforts of the coal company. Kennedy also said that energy markets must be rationalized to harness social purpose.
“Today, we don’t need to abolish carbon to understand that our deadly addiction to it is the principal drag on American capitalism,” Kennedy said. “Until recently, we were borrowing a billion dollars a day mainly from nations that don’t share our values in order to import a billion dollars worth of oil … We were, in essence, funding both sides of the war in terror.”
Kennedy addressed the current state of oil in the free market system as crony capitalism, referring to the practices which subsidize the price of oil translating in higher taxes.
“If we were paying the true price of oil it would cost $12 to $15, but because the subsidies are hidden you are paying them through taxes and the market gets the wrong signals,” Kennedy said. “We think gasoline automobiles is a pretty good deal, but it is bankrupting our country and society, as well as making us sick. Nuclear energy and all the incumbents are heavily subsidized. This is not free market capitalism, it is crony capitalism.”
Kennedy also cited the example of asphalt roads created by coal companies seen in West Virginia, Kentucky, Wyoming, Illinois and other states, stating that coal companies leave the burden of high costs to regular individuals through high taxes and by subsidies.
“Corporate crony capitalism is when you get the government to pay your cost,” he said. “It is where you externalize and shift them to the public and that is what is happening here.”
Kennedy also frequently referred to corporate kleptocracy, explaining the term as a concept which includes executives from wealthy corporations who fund politicians to enact policies that follow their ambition at the expense of shareholders.
In order to reverse the issue, Kennedy suggested the process of designing a system that served the public interest, one that would include free energy accessible to all through the creation of universal energy grids. In order to do so, he cited countries such as Sweden and Iceland, explaining that being completely coal-free correlates to stronger economies.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Waterkeeper Alliance is a bottled-water company that donates proceeds to the organization Riverkeeper. It is actually a global movement uniting more than 250 Waterkeeper organizations around the world and focusing citizen advocacy on issues that affect waterways, from pollution to climate change. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Marshall’s Center for Management Communication continued its Speaker Series on Thursday afternoon.The presentation titled, “The Power of Discourse: How Communication Creates, Defines, and Directs Organizations,” is the second part within the Speaker Series, which commemorates the Center’s 35th anniversary. The event featured a speech given by Professor François Cooren, Chair of the Department of Communication at the University of Montreal.
Sky Marsen, one of the associate professors at the Center, stated that Cooren’s unique perspective is what made the Center want to ask him to speak.
“Well [Francois Cooren] is representative of what is known as the Montreal School of Communication,” Marsen said. “It’s a special kind of approach. So he will be presenting the principles and the methods of this approach and giving examples from his own research on how this approach works. So it will give students ideas about what method to use if they wanted to use this method. How to research topics, and problems and issues in communication using this method.”
Cooren similarly spoke highly of the Center for Management Communication, stating that it was their prestige as well as the chance for him to communicate what he has learned through his research to students that made their offer for him to present stand out.
“It’s a very prestigious institution so for me it was an honor to be invited,” he said. “I’ve been working on organizational communication for the past twenty five years, so for me it’s a topic that I hope to communicate to the audience. It’s not typical business communication what I’m doing. I’m trying to defend what I call a constitutive view of communication, which is that communication kind of makes organizations what they are. So instead of thinking about communication as being ‘okay we need to communicate that’, I like to think about communication as any kind of interaction within the organizational life in general.”
Cooren further expanded on his ideas by highlighting the importance of the subtext that belies speech in an organizational setting.
“One of the points I’m making which might be controversial, is that when people communicate with each other, they tend to make other things speak. It’s kind of a strange idea, this idea that we are not only talking but in many respects expressing values, principles, evoking rules, procedures, and reaffirming mission statements. So oftentimes we are cultivating in our speech what matters to us in organizations.”
Following Cooren’s presentation was a brief panel consisting of panelists Drew Boyles, CEO of Endless Pursuit Corporation, US-West Regional Director of Entrepreneur’s Organization, and Chairman of El Segundo Economic Advisory Council; Janet Fulk, USC Professor of Management and Organization; Peter Monge, USC Professor of Communication; and Patricia Riley, Director of USC’s Global Communication Program. The panel was moderated by CMC professor Sky Marsen.
Marsen noted that she hopes that the presentation as well as the panel informed the students who were in attendance to encourage the Center to continue bringing in influential speakers in the coming semesters.
“We hope to continue [speakers with unique approaches] with other speakers just to show the richness of methods and approaches to business communication. We started in the beginning of February and we’re hoping to do a couple a semester. We started this year but we want to continue, so we hope the ones that we’ve had are popular and useful for people and to encourage us to continue for years to come”.

Former CIA director and Price School of Public Policy Judge Widney Professor David Petraeus was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine on Thursday.
In February 2015, Petraeus pleaded guilty to sharing classified information with his biographer and former mistress, Paula Broadwell, in 2011.
According to CNN, the 5-by-8 inch notebooks Petraeus provided Broadwell included information from national security meetings and the identities of covert officers.
Petraeus avoided jail time as part of his plea deal with the Department of Justice because the information he provided Broadwell was never revealed to the public or published in her biography of him.
Petraeus’ original sentence ordered him to pay $40,000 until federal Judge David Kessler increased the amount to $100,000 in order to “reflect the seriousness of the offense,” according to CNN.
Michael O’ Hanlon, a close friend of Petraeus said that the former military leaders’ actions regarding the leak should not define his career.
“The personal shortcomings ultimately, I would hope, will be seen as in the same light as Grant’s whiskey or Eisenhower’s mistress, or whatever else,” O’Hanlon told CNN. “The inevitable human dimensions of people who are still great Americans.”
Petraeus retired as a four-star general and leader of U.S. troops in the Iraq War to become the head the CIA in 2011. He retired one year later after his affair with Broadwell was revealed.
Petraeus joined the USC faculty in October 2013 and serves as a faculty adviser for the USC Veterans Association.

Earlier this week, light posts on Trousdale Parkway were adorned with banners depicting pregnant women and developing fetuses. The banners sported phrases including “Fatherhood begins in the womb” and “Life is a beauty — admire it.”
The banners were taken down within hours of being installed. The display caused controversy on campus, as did their removal.
USC Students for Life, a pro-life group on campus, funded the creation of the banners and said they went through the proper channels to seek approval before displaying them on Trousdale.
Assistant Provost for Student Engagement Monique Allard said in a statement that Trojan Event Services, a unit of Student Affairs, approved the request for installation in error. University policy stipulates that banners on Trousdale may only be mounted on Trousdale if the banners identify an academic program, department or event specifically. The pro-life banners did not.
USC Students for Life founder Lisa Ebiner Gavit said the banners were intended as a “celebration of life” and to serve as a complement to the club’s final event of the semester, an on-campus baby shower to benefit the Los Angeles Pregnancy Resource Center.
“We wanted to show the beauty and value of the unborn child,” Gavit said. “We wanted to show pregnant women that abortion is not their only option. We wanted to show men that they have a role to play in fighting for the life of their child. We knew the banners would be controversial, but they are true.”
She said the organization raised $3,100 over eight months to pay for the banner creation and image rights, including $950 for installation and removal of the banners. The banners were intended to stay up for two weeks.
In her statement, Allard said USC will reimburse the group for the full cost of producing and installing the banners. Though Gavit sees the university’s removal of the banners as a restriction of free speech, Austin Roy, a sophomore studying cognitive science, disagrees.
After seeing the banners on Tuesday, Roy made his own sign reading, “Women deserve the right to choose,” and posted it beneath the pro-life banners.
“I think that USC, by taking down the banners, is trying to protect its students,” Roy said. “They’re not prohibiting this group from having a table on Trousdale or talking to students or from making posters, but these banners hold an official place at USC and [the university] should decide what is on them.”
Roy said that his goal in creating new signs was to accomodate those who were in disagreement with the banners.
“I saw the banners and I thought that they could very easily make individuals on the USC campus feel isolated and demonized,” he said. “I thought I would make a sign letting those individuals know that they’re not wrong, that they are accepted and that they are just as much a part of the Trojan family as anyone else in the USC community.”
Roy said that though he is pro-choice, he doesn’t think any group tackling a controversial issue should post banners on Trousdale because the university should not appear to take a stance that would polarize a portion of its student body. He said the university is taking positive steps by reimbursing the group.
In her statement, Allard said that the university respects students’ right to free speech.
“The university is a diverse community based on the free exchange of ideas, and we encourage free inquiry and discussion,” she said.
Correction: An earlier version of this article said Students for Life’s final event of the semester would be a baby shower at the Los Angeles Pregnancy Resource Center. The baby shower will actually take place on campus to benefit the center. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
I am shocked at the level of intolerance shown by some of the comments here that demonize the people putting up these banners. I don’t think these banners were an attempt to shame women into not getting an abortion, but in their view it was a celebration of life. Without getting into another internet ideological argument of whether abortion is wrong or right, I feel that the University should allow ALL students groups the right to express their views without fear of reprisal. Labeling this group a “negative” organization is hypocrisy at its highest level, especially in a place that promotes the celebration of different viewpoints and supposedly places diversity in its highest esteem. You may not agree with someone’s opposing views, but it does should not mean that if someone’s feelings are hurt that they should be able to stifle the views of another. I do not see why the a Pro-Choice group could not have raised money and posted banners expressing their views too. Whatever happened to SC Respect, whatever happened to being civil in disagreement without having to resort to name-calling and ad-hominem attacks?
First, the banners did not damage the university image at all. Second, the banners were not officially endorsed. Third, having a different opinion than the author of this article (pro-life vs pro-choice) does not make their banners propaganda. Stop victimizing the pro-life group just because they view it differently and because a poster does not mention maternal health, does not mean the pro-life group does not consider that concern when they decide to be pro-life. You simplified a complex argument with strong points on both sides down to a simple black and white verdict, which is completely inaccurate and baseless. There is nothing wrong with choosing pro-life or pro-choice. I am pro-life and that is a personal decision of mine.
The entire thing was done in error. USC refunded the money (do you know how hard it is to get any kind of refund from USC?!?). Why is this still an issue? Nobody is being “censored” – the group is free to continue tabling on campus. This is now about bullying from the Pro-lifers.
I side with the university on this. These banners have no place on campus. The complaints about the Black History Month banners and Gay Pride banners being allowed to stay is hilarious – as if celebrating peoples who have been (and still are) historically oppressed is such a bad thing: “waaaah the darkies and the queers get banners but our banners that link to webpages that spout inaccurate medical information don’t get them waaaah!!!” Plus, were those banners NOT endorsed by the university? I didn’t know USC joining the rest of LA in Celebration of Pride or recognizing Black History month was such a “polarizing” thing. You go to school in Los Angeles, if you don’t like that those groups are given recognition you are more than welcome to transfer to Bob Jones University with like minded people.
Which brings me to my other point: these banners featured websites that are led by Crisis Pregnancy Centers, which Los Angeles Pregnancy Services is. If you know anything about these organizations, they make it their mission to talk people OUT of abortions with medically inaccurate information. These organizations claim abortion causes breast cancer, causes its own “syndrome” and say contraceptives cause abortions – accusations that every reputable medical society has debunked time and time again. USC is a research institution with a very advanced medical school – for the university to allow those banners to stay up would be a slap in the face to every individual who is involved with growing USC’s medical school into an even more prestigious institution.  
Finally, they got their money back. Instead of trying to bully USC into putting up these banners, why not use that money and make sure that people get access to reliable contraceptives and comprehensive sexual education? You know, things that actually reduce the numbers of abortions.
Oh yeah. Because those are things that might actually help people.
I am offended that people are comparing
this organization to inclusive, positive organizations like Pride
groups. This is about shaming and control and has nothing to do with
concern about unborn lives. If these people truly cared about unborn
children at risk of abortion, they would consider the data that shows
that most women make such decisions for financial reasons. Women who
see no way to feed a child when they can barely support themselves,
or who know that having a child will lock them into a cycle of
poverty that they are very unlikely to ever escape. Instead these are
the same people who consistently vote to limit the safety nets that
would ensure such children have food or that their mothers have
access to opportunity that might lift their families out of poverty,
like education. Instead poor single mothers are criminalized and
socially shamed with drug-testing for aid, draconian requirements to
qualify for help and a complete loss of respect within the system.
A woman SHOULD be shamed for getting pregnant when she can not afford it and can see no way to feed it when “they can barely support themselves”, as in the example you cite!!!  Such an outrage.  Nobody simply “gets pregnant”.  Life is full of choices, large and small.  As I’ve said many time before, a little more focus on “responsibilities” instead of “rights” would do this world a lot of good.
I respect many different points of view, just not yours and that is my right. I disagree with you completely that the world would be a better place in any way without a focus on our rights as Americans and as human beings. You don’t agree with me and you definitely don’t respect my point of view, so maybe you need a little more maturity, not I. My point doesn’t change. We no longer live in a the world of the scarlet letter no matter how much you would like to bring it back. Birth control is a complex issue that includes forces of economics, gender, and education and if you really cared about making constructive changes you would look there rather than shame which has never and will never work.
Don’t kid yourself.  You do NOT respect many different points of view.  You believe as firmly in your position as I do in mine.  We are each entitled to our opinion.  The difference between us is that I affirm your right to hold and promote yours, whereas you wish to silence my right to the same.  (I also proudly take ownership of my opinions, by posting them with my name visible.)  For these reasons and more, I see little reason to acknowledge you (whoever you are) or your opinion with further comment.
1. That’s my name, bringing into question who I am doesn’t change my position.
2. My opinions are constantly evolving based on fact and truth and I am happy to listen to and consider any position that comes from that place.
3. I don’t agree that you or anyone has the right to disseminate inaccurate information to try to control other people’s lives.
4. You will get no further comment from me, not because I question your identity, but because I’ve looked at a few of your other comments and you’re just kind of mean and mad. Nothing I say is going to change that. I’m sorry other people’s lives bother you so much. That’s a long road to walk.
Yeah, I’m a proud Trojan who loves USC… but there definitely appears to be a double-standard here.  The stated policy that banners on Trousdale must identify an “academic program, department or event” appears to be enforced selectively.  It seems clear that these banners represented the baby shower event on campus, and were approved accordingly UNTIL a certain segment of the University community became upset… only after which they were removed.  So is this the real policy?  See how people feel and then decide if banners stay or go?  And so what if people didn’t like the banners or felt uncomfortable or “isolated”?!  I thought our universities were supposed to protect the reasonable free expression of ideas and thought.  Pro-Choice advocates never seem to care that pro-life advocates are disturbed at ghastly techniques approved and used to kill unwanted and unborn babies.  So it really shouldn’t matter what side you are on if you want to protect the free expression of ideas and debate.
By the way, it’s time we return words like “shame”, “regret” and “fear” to our vocabulary.  Our modern society seems to think these words and feelings are unacceptable when in fact they are important and natural indicators that humans do in fact have a conscience.  If we feel afraid, ashamed, isolated or regretful, we should reach deep inside for an honest and objective look into why we are experiencing such feelings… rather than looking outwardly simply to quash that which caused the discomfort.
Thankfully, our wonderful school is no longer a bastion for your father’s hoary right wing views. Bully for us! Fight on!
My father’s an old Asian mailman. What makes you think he has any elaborate American right-wing views…? -_-
Eh, my comment was not directed at you, Matthew. Was a general observation about how far the university has come.
USC taking down these banners, while allowing gay pride banners to stay up for 2 weeks, is incredibly sad.  
Mathew: the DT always interviews students – it is, after all, a student newspaper…
This article is written in the same calibre as creedthoughts.gov from The Office. I do not understand how a 20-year-old kid is presented as credible opinion on this matter. For shame USC, I can’t believe I gave you guys $50,000 a year for four years when when I went here…

On Wednesday, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences gender studies program announced the introduction of the LGBTQ studies minor for undergraduates beginning in fall 2015.
The process of creating the minor started with Rev. Kelby Harrison, director of the USC LGBT Resource Center, who approached the gender studies department with the suggestion of creating a minor for students interested in the topic.
The 20-unit minor consists of one lower-division course, one upper-division course and three upper-division electives. The upper-division required course, SWMS 306: Introduction to LGBTQ Studies, was created specifically for the minor. In addition to the minor requirement, SWMS 212: Studies in Gender and Sexuality: An Introduction, also fulfills a general education requirement.
Jeanne Weiss, student services advisor for the gender studies program, said that she hopes the new major will reach a broader demographic.
“We hope to reach students throughout the university and provide a minor that would benefit them,” said Weiss.
Weiss also discussed the uniqueness of the minor in relation to other areas of study already offered through Dornsife.
“The gender studies minor focuses mostly on feminist issues, while the LGBTQ minor focuses on queer studies, giving students a good opportunity to formalize their studies in this area,” said Weiss.
Jorge Molina, a junior majoring in writing for film and television and co-director of Queer Cut, an LGBTQ student organization at the School of Cinematic Arts, spoke about how the newly introduced minor will promote an improved sense of equality on campus.
“I think it’s great that the university is recognizing that LGBT issues are as important of being studied as any other major cultural group,” Molina said. “This will hopefully start a conversation among students and staff and the entire Trojan community about the importance of recognition and integration.”
The LGBTQ studies minor is open to students of all majors. Those interested in learning more about the minor can contact Weiss.

By now, our generation is fairly acquainted with the concept of an “open relationship.” There might be many of us who have personally tried it out, or heard about it second-hand. For fairly liberal college students, most of us can see the logic behind it, though not all of us may agree with it. In the same vein as open relationships are open marriages. Yet, while cultural beliefs are shifting rapidly in this day and age to accept such institutions, there persists the urge to preserve monogamy.
In a Huffington Post article that explores real-life examples of open marriages, we learn about couples who dabble in non-monogamy for a few years and other couples who have established clear rules on how they go about their non-monogamous activities. In the article, for example, Bryce and Dana lay down some ground rules, which included always practicing safe sex, not spending the night at other people’s places, and running every sexual encounter by one another first.
There is a very logical attempt to distinguish between the carnal and the emotional, which can be quite difficult to separate. In a Live Science article, Dr. Schwartz claims that “monogamy is invented for order and investment — but not necessarily because it’s ‘natural.’” Dr. Lancaster also explains that the social concept of monogamy ensures the continuation of the human race, which makes it a “compromise” that all humans must make.
In that sense, the concept of “open marriages” not only appears to be a paradox, but it also seems to dive into the heart of a huge conflict between human desire and social compromise. If society were to function in an orderly fashion, then this type of conflict is not one that can be dissected in mainstream culture. This may all seem like pretty heavy implications simply for a few couples who are just trying out new trends, but it does explain why “open marriages” will never be the norm.

The arrival of a new Star Wars movie is typically greeted with the kind of fanfare one associates with rare astronomical events. Like a meteor shower or a total lunar eclipse, it prompts people to behave strangely, don peculiar costumes and stay out at ungodly hours, all for the chance to catch a glimpse of something with the potential to inspire feelings of wonder and awe. Just last week, hundreds of millions of viewers from across the globe fought back joyful tears as they laid eyes on Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) for the first time in three decades in the new trailer for The Force Awakens.
That sense of momentousness is a big part of what makes Star Wars so special to its fans. The agony and the ecstasy of waiting on further adventures makes the release of each new installment seem all the sweeter when the time finally comes. There were three-year gaps between each episode of the Original Trilogy, and 16 years — call them the Dark Times — passed between Return of the Jedi and the false dawn that was The Phantom Menace, an underwhelming mess that benefited from one of the finest marketing blitzes in cinematic history. What happens, however, when the extraordinary becomes ordinary, when the sight of an eclipse becomes as familiar as a sunset? Disney appears intent on finding out.
During a panel on the final day of last weekend’s mammoth Star Wars Celebration fan event in Anaheim, director Gareth Edwards and Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy unveiled their plans for the first in a planned series of Star Wars spin-offs. Between these films and the previously announced sequel trilogy fronted by The Force Awakens, every year from 2015 onward will see the release of at least one new Disney-produced Star Wars movie in theaters. It sounds like a fantastic proposition for cineastes who crave nothing but dessert, but it also runs the risk of diluting the brand George Lucas spent his life cultivating.
Edwards’ movie, now saddled with a December 2016 release date and the cumbersome title Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One, does boast an admittedly enticing premise — the director describes it as a rousing wartime epic with the soul of a spy thriller centered on the untold story of how the newly founded Rebel Alliance managed to steal the plans to the first Death Star immediately prior to the events of the original Star Wars. This daring raid, often referred to but never explicitly detailed in the now-defunct Expanded Universe canon, seems ripe for dramatization, especially given Edwards’ professed desire to make a film devoid of the usual Jedi and Sith power struggles, focusing instead on the street-level guerilla tactics of the Rebel commandos and the surprising moral complexity of the tenacious Imperial officers who oppose them in their mission.
The film’s prospective cast reflects Kennedy’s ongoing commitment to inject diversity into A Galaxy Far, Far Away, no mean feat for a franchise known for featuring only one major female character in its first three installments. So far the only confirmed player is Felicity Jones, the British actress who earned positive notices as Stephen Hawking’s dutiful wife in last year’s gauzy melodrama The Theory of Everything. The Oscar nominee, who can currently be seen playing Jonah Hill’s strong-willed spouse in True Story, will reportedly portray a Rebel agent who proves instrumental in securing the Death Star plans by infiltrating the unfinished battle station with an elite team of spies and soldiers.
Jones’ co-stars will likely include Riz Ahmed as a fellow insurgent and Ben Mendelsohn — best known for The Place Beyond the Pines and the Aussie crime thriller Animal Kingdom — as a ruthless Imperial inquisitor who answers directly to Darth Vader. Ahmed, a British actor with Pakistani heritage whose list of credits includes The Reluctant Fundamentalist and Four Lions, is probably most familiar to American audiences as Jake Gyllenhaal’s tragically dim-witted assistant Rick in last year’s L.A. neo-noir Nightcrawler.
The casting seems on point and the setup is certainly intriguing, but what about the guy steering the ship? Is Edwards truly the best choice to direct Rogue One? The answer depends on which version of the filmmaker shows up when production gets underway this summer. If it’s the Edwards who made the surprisingly affecting indie creature feature Monsters for less than $500,000, the Skywalker brand is in good hands. If it’s the Edwards who killed off the most interesting character (Bryan Cranston’s guilt-ridden nuclear engineer) roughly a third of the way through the Godzilla reboot and spent the balance of the runtime playing a $160 million game of kaiju peekaboo, we might be in serious trouble. Hopefully Zero Dark Thirty cinematographer Greig Fraser can inspire the director to rise to the occasion.
So what about the other Star Wars spin-offs? Only one other stand-alone movie has been announced so far, and its fate is in many ways still uncertain. Josh Trank, who helmed the superpowers-in-suburbia drama Chronicle and is currently in post-production on Fox’s upcoming Fantastic Four reboot, was announced as the director early on, but the filmmaker was conspicuously absent from last Sunday’s panel, which was supposed to feature both Edwards and Trank talking about their respective projects. The movie, which is rumored to be a prequel revolving around either Han Solo or Boba Fett, currently has no title, no cast attachments and no logline to speak of. It’s possible that Disney is waiting to see how Fantastic Four performs before deciding whether or not to proceed with Trank, whose big budget bonafides are still unproven.
If Kennedy hopes to expand the Star Wars universe without risking overexposure, she would be wise to follow the model set forth by Marvel Studios head honcho and USC alumnus Kevin Feige, who has been saturating the market with superheroes for the better part of seven years now. Feige and his army of creatives have staved off audience exhaustion through their willingness to continually experiment with style, tone and genre, creating a cinematic universe whose moving parts, from the concrete jungles of Daredevil’s Hell’s Kitchen to the glittering spires of Thor’s Asgard, feel simultaneously cohesive and distinct. The Star Wars saga also contains multitudes of characters and stories, each demanding their own interpretation by gifted filmmakers, writers and actors. The real trick will be to maintain the quality as the quantity grows. The release of a new Star Wars movie might not be rare anymore, but it should always feel special.

John Travolta’s heyday of singing and dancing on Grease and swaggering on Pulp Fiction is now nothing more than a distant memory. Set in gloomy Boston and filled with mediocre action, director Philip Martin’s The Forger is disappointing at best. The movie follows Ray Cutter (Travolta) and his life after leaving prison 10 months early. Ray’s former employer and criminal boss, Tommy Keegan (Anson Mount), helped imprison Ray in the first place and later bribed a local judge in order to get Ray.
Upon visiting his family home, Ray is brusquely greeted by his father and former petty thief, Joseph (Christopher Plummer), who calls Ray a fool for leaving prison early. Ray’s son Will (Tye Sheridan), however, is pale and distraught at seeing his father out of prison. It quickly becomes apparent that Ray wanted to leave prison early in order to spend more time with Will, who has a stage IV brain tumor. Joseph further condemns Ray for leaving prison early after he discovers that Ray made a deal with Keegan to bribe the judge that released him from prison. In exchange for the bribe, Ray must forge Monet’s 1875 painting “Woman with a Parasol” in three weeks so it can be exchanged with the original, which in turn would be sold to an international drug cartel boss to pay off Keegan’s debt. The rest of the film follows Ray’s struggle to balance spending time with his dying son and forging the intricate masterpiece.
Throughout the film, Travolta appears to get more and more bored. He lazily delivers his lines in silent mumbles that border on incoherent at times. His eyes have a heavy glaze similar to the one he had as heroin-addicted Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction. Overall, Travolta looks as if someone forced him to be a part of this film.
His co-star Plummer, however, delivers an exciting and rather contrasting performance. He is unafraid to deliver, cursing constantly and providing hard glares at his fellow cast members. It becomes difficult to differentiate whether he is cursing at the characters or at the actors for their poor performances. Despite being a young actor, Sheridan delivers a promising performance as Will. His portrayal of a 15-year-old cancer patient becomes more genuine as his character begins to submit special requests to his father, such as his desire to lose his virginity before his death and to meet his drug-addicted mother, played by Jennifer Ehle. As Will’s health continues to deteriorate, Sheridan’s emotional portrayal of Will becomes stronger. Though the trio of actors generally worked well together, it was no surprise when Sheridan’s character wanted to follow his father and grandfather’s footsteps in the world of crime. Despite certain cliches, there is no question that the film would have been much stronger as a whole had Travolta delivered a less lethargic performance.
Overall, the film moves at a very slow pace sprinkled with the occasional action scene. However, the action scenes are short and do not include much detail. For example, when Keegan sends his men to stalk and intimidate Ray into creating another forgery, Ray responds with his recurring apathetic behavior and nonchalantly beats them, telling them to leave him alone when he is with his son. The development of Ray and Will’s relationship throughout the film contributes greatly to the particularly slow nature of this “crime” movie, as there are several scenes dedicated to the reparation of the pair’s relationship, which is full of cheesy moments. Will’s cancer serves as a catalyst for even tackier “feel-good” scenes, as it causes Ray to agree to things he might normally say no to. For example, when Will wants to meet his mother, Ray goes out of his way to find her and forces her to get her act together to meet their son. Had Will been cancer-free, there would have been no place for such a scene in this film.
This film had the potential to be great, but fell short for several reasons. Mainly, Travolta’s apathetic demeanor and cursory actions resulted in a lackluster performance that served as a distraction from the overall themes of the film. In addition, the premise itself seems like a bad combination of previous crime films. The whole trope of the son having a fast-acting terminal disease, which causes the father-son relationship to be mended, has been explored countless times. At the beginning of the film, Ray and Will’s relationship appears strained, likely because of Ray’s time spent in prison. However, as the film progresses, the pair bonds over working together to settle Ray’s debt. Also, the concept of forging art and exchanging it in order to steal the original is a storyline that has been told before in all sorts of ways. Had the writers and actors worked together to create stronger characters with more realistic perspectives and less corny attitudes, The Forger could have been a much better film.

There has been much global attention on Egypt over the past few years. From the Arab Spring revolution and protests to recent elections, Egypt’s political state has been far from stable. Other nonpolitical issues have featured prominently in Egypt as well. On April 14, Egypt’s administrative court upheld a decision by the interior ministry to deport a man because of allegations that he was gay, thus affirming the right of the ministry to ban and deport other LGBT foreigners from Egypt. An Egyptian newspaper, Al-Ahram, reported that the court upheld the man’s deportation as a way to “preserve the public interest and religious and social values.” The Egyptian administrative court’s concern over “preserving national interest” in this way is unjustified, and Egyptian law needs re-evaluation.
The case involved a Libyan man who appealed his 2008 deportation from Egypt after he was accused of what was described as “debauchery” in exchange for money. The man, who had lived in Egypt since 2006, appealed his deportation on the grounds that he was a graduate student at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Cairo, and that he would not be able to complete his studies if deported. This case comes at a time of increased attacks on alleged gaysand lesbian people in Egypt, a movement led by the interior ministry and judicial body, and demonstrates the role that the state has granted the Egyptian police with regard to upholding society’s morality.
In January, a Cairo court acquitted 26 defendants accused of homosexual activities in a bath house. The case drew international criticism for the televised police harassment of the men. In December, eight men were given year-long prison sentences for allegedly taking part in a gay marriage ceremony on a Nile boat. These actions taken by the Egyptian government have made those who identify as members of the LGBT community fear living in Egypt and getting charged with “debauchery.”
Amnesty International said that the decision to refuse the Libyan man re-entry into Egypt sets a “very dangerous precedent.” It is also one of many testaments to the continued corruption of the Egyptian government. Given that explicit discrimination is not formal law in Egypt, it is unacceptable to create charges and legal bans for gay foreigners, as it is not illegal to be gay in Egypt. To act solely based on a social norm of homophobia is not only unlawful, but also a way for the Egyptian government to distract attention away from the widespread political chaos.
Though places like the United States have made strides in supporting the LGBT community, many other places such as Egypt have yet to adopt a non-homophobic mindset. The Egyptian government’s discrimination against gay residents distracts citizens from other human rights violations in Egypt and demonstrates continued injustice. Making Egypt a safer place should be of the utmost importance to authorities, and the first step should be to eliminate political violence and discrimination against the LGBT community. It’s up to the world to help with these efforts.
No it isn’t up to the world.  It is up to Egyptians, and until they throw Islam into the garbage heap where it belongs the LGBT community will know no peace.
Islam:  The religion of intolerance.

After signing a treaty with Germany and de facto bringing the Ottoman Empire into the First World War on the side of Germany, the Ottoman empire’s nationalist leaders declared war on Russia as part of their aim — a pan-Turkic expansion into central Asia at Russia’s expense. The Armenian minority, who sought to realize their national aspirations and found an Armenian autonomy in the empire, were perceived as traitors and collaborators with the Russians. The “Young Turks,” the Turkish nationalist party, which deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid II and ruled the empire, acted for “Turkification” of the territories under its control, which meant ethnic cleansing of the Christian minority. Those responsible for planning and overseeing the Armenian genocide were the top brass of the Young Turks: Interior Minister Mehmed Talaat Pasha, Minister of War Enver Pasha and Ahmed Djemal Pasha, known as the “Three Pashas” that held de facto rule over the empire from 1913 until the end of World War I in 1918. These senior officials ordered the founding of a paramilitary organization, the “Special Organization” — Techkilat-i Mahsoussé — which was used to solve the “Armenian problem.” The organization was tasked with expelling and destroying the Armenian minority. Criminals and specially freed convicts were drafted into its ranks to execute the plan.
On the night between April 23 and April 24, 1915, on the direct order of Talaat Pasha, the Turkish army stormed the homes of the Armenian minority leaders; at least 250 prominent Armenians — poets, doctors, bankers and a member of the Ottoman parliament — were arrested in Istanbul, tortured and then cruelly killed. Consequently, April 24 symbolizes the beginning of the Armenian genocide and was set as its official Day of Remembrance. Investigators believe that from 1914 to 1918, between 1-1.5 million Armenian men, women and children were cruelly and systematically murdered. Men were separated from women and children and swiftly executed. Those who remained alive were deported to concentration camps in the Syrian Desert and let die from hunger and rampant infectious diseases. In areas where ammunition was in short supply, killing squads relied on whatever weapons were at hand — axes, cleavers, even shovels. Adults were hacked to pieces, and infants dashed against the rocks. In the Black Sea region, Armenians were loaded onto boats and thrown overboard. In the area around Lake Hazar, they were tossed over cliffs.
The Jewish ambassador of America to Turkey in those days, Henry Morgenthau (1913-16), had the courage to confront the Turkish leaders about the massacres of the Armenians and implore the U.S. government to intercede and stop what he called “a campaign of race extermination in progress” and described as “the greatest crime in modern history.” Because of his outspokenness, Morgenthau lost his job and was recalled. He obviously did not predict what was in store later in the 20th century for the Jews.
One of the Nuremberg trial documents reveals that the indifference of the global public toward the Turkish slaughter of Armenians during World War I and the lack of appropriate response from the international community encouraged Adolf Hitler to conquer territories and annihilate Jews in Europe. In addressing his military advisors eight days before invading Poland in 1939, Hitler asked, “Who today, after all, speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians? Who remembers those Armenians?” Hitler made it clear that he was both inspired by what the Young Turk government had done to the Armenians in 1915 and also noted that because the memory of the atrocities committed against the Armenians had been so easily washed away, it was easier to commit genocide again and international response should not be feared.
The aftermath of the extermination of the Armenians has been marked by an aggressive state-sponsored assault by the Turkish government on the historical truth of the Armenian genocide. Thus, it is not surprising that Mehmet Talaat Pasha, one of the masterminds of the Armenian genocide, has many prominent streets named after him in modern-day Turkey. To these days, modern Turkey vehemently refuses to admit its historic involvement in the murder of the Armenian people and invests huge funds in propaganda denying the Armenian massacres. A case in point, in 2012, the Turkish government successfully forced the British government to order the Tate Gallery’s removal of the word “genocide” from the wall text of the exhibit of the work of Armenian genocide survivor Arshile Gorky. Due to Turkey’s geostrategic importance and the Turkish government’s aggressive diplomatic pressure, only 23 countries have had the courage to recognize officially the Armenian genocide. Neither the U.S. nor Israel is among them. Notwithstanding the deep involvement and commitment of many Jewish and American intellectuals to the Armenian plight and discourse, the U.S. and Israeli governments have failed to pass an Armenian genocide resolution, which is to say, to make an official gesture of redress to Turkish denial. For this I am deeply sorry.
The Jewish historian Deborah Lipstadt has written that “denial of genocide, whether that of the Turks against the Armenians or the Nazis against the Jews, is not an act of historical reinterpretation … but an insidious form of intellectual and moral degradation … it strives to reshape history in order to demonize the victims and rehabilitate the perpetrators.” And, Pope Francis made clear in his recent address about the Armenian genocide, “Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it!”
As human beings our motto should be: I am a human being. Whatever affects another human being affects me. I join you, members of the Armenian community, on your Memorial Day, as you mark the 100th anniversary of your genocide. I am here, with you, as a human being, as a Jew, as an Israeli, as an American.
The Armenian genocide must be firmly etched in the personal consciousness of each and every one of us, and in our collective memory. This should be our obligation to you; this is our obligation to ourselves. When the bells of the Armenian churches will ring on the April 24, ask not for whom the bells toll, they toll for thee.

The USC baseball team will continue its quest for a  Pac-12 title this weekend when it travels to Oregon State to face the Beavers.
The Trojans (29-10, 10-5 Pac-12) will be well-rested going into the series, as they did not have a game on Tuesday after facing the Oregon Ducks last weekend.
Though the Ducks gave USC some trouble, the Trojans were able to win the series in convincing fashion.
On Friday, starting pitcher Brent Wheatley put the team in an early hole, allowing four runs in the first inning.
USC responded quickly, however, by putting up three runs of their own in the bottom half of the frame.
Wheatley settled down after his rough first inning and did not allow another run until he was pulled with two outs in the top of the fourth.
The Trojan offense exploded in the bottom of the fourth, forcing a bases-loaded walk to tie the game.
With the game tied at four runs apiece, junior Timmy Robinson put the Trojans ahead for good with his first collegiate grand slam.
The Ducks went on to score one more run, but the Trojans tacked on five more of their own and won the contest 13-5.
Saturday did not go quite so well for the Trojans, however, as they were unable to climb out of another early deficit.
After only two innings, USC was down 7-0 as starter Kyle Twomey and the defense behind him were uncharacteristically shaky.
Before the Trojans could even get on the board, the Ducks added two more runs to lead 9-0 going into the bottom of the sixth inning.
By then, the game was in hand for Oregon, and the Ducks went on to tie the series with a 15-4 victory.
But USC would not let Oregon leave Los Angeles with a series victory, as starter Mitch Hart dominated the Ducks in the rubber match of the weekend series.
The freshman pitcher hurled six innings and gave up only one run.
Oregon got ahead early yet again, as Jakob Goldfarb jumped on Hart’s first pitch of the ball game, sending it over the outfield fence for a lead-off home run. Hart settled in nicely,  however, striking out eight over the next six innings.
The Trojans backed Hart with four runs in the first four innings, providing more than enough support for the young right-hander.
After Hart left the game, though, reliever Marc Huberman gave up two runs in the top of the seventh to bring the Ducks within striking distance, 4-3. But USC responded quickly, adding two runs in the seventh and another in the eighth to put the game out of reach for the Ducks.
Head coach Dan Hubbs said the series was a testament to his team’s ability to overcome adversity.
“We know every team in our league is good and every game is going to be a dogfight,” Hubbs said.
“We’ve shown the ability to win a game 2-0, and we’ve shown the ability to win a game 10-8. Whatever we have to do to win the game that day is what we have to do, and the kids have been real resilient with that. And they’ve been relentless at trying to win every game, and I don’t expect that to change.”
Looking ahead, the Trojans face yet another tough test as they travel to Corvallis, Oregon, to play the Beavers at Goss Stadium. Oregon State (25-12, 8-7 Pac-12) has struggled a bit through conference play but has dominated at home, boasting a 16-3 record there this season.
Hubbs said that the typically wet weather in Oregon is especially hard to hit in, and he attributes the Beavers’ success at home to both their ability to adapt to the cold and their strong fan support.
“They get good crowds, so it’s hard to lay an egg when you’re at home … but it’s a tougher place to hit, and they can really pitch,” Hubbs said.
“We’re going to have to have good at bats, and we’re going to have to pitch well because they always have good energy in the stadium, and it’s supposed to be a little wet this weekend, so it’ll be tougher hitting conditions,” Hubbs said. “We’ll just have to overcome it, kind of like we did in Seattle. I’m confident if we do what we’re capable of doing, we’ll find ways to win ballgames.”
The Beavers have had a rough stretch of late — losing five of their last nine games -— but they are coming off a series win against Arizona last weekend. With some momentum going into the series against the Trojans, the Beavers may have some added confidence against one of the best teams in the conference.
Hubbs said his team doesn’t worry about what other teams are doing, however, as they’re focused on playing their best every day to get this program back to being a perennial national title contender.
“We really turned a corner in the second half of last year where they really started to believe they could win, and win big. But when we didn’t make it into the tournament last year, it lit another fire under them,” Hubbs said.“They really came out this season with a sense of, ‘Hey, we’re not going to let that happen again, we’re not going to leave it up to chance, and we’ll just pound our way through’.”
Nevertheless, wins will not come easy this weekend. Oregon State has a solid offense this season, but their best player may very well be one of their pitchers, right-handed starter Andrew Moore, who has dazzled this season.
Moore has a 4-1 record with a 1.40 ERA, and he has gotten better as the season has progressed, posting an otherworldly 3-0 record with a 0.68 ERA in 40 innings of conference play. He is set to start the series opener on Friday.
Hubbs said the series might come down to the Trojans’ ability to beat the other two starters in the Beavers’ rotation, but he believes USC is still more than capable of beating Moore.
“We’re going to go out and give our best effort to beat Moore, but we have to pitch really well because if we give up a bunch of runs, we’ll lose that game,” Hubbs said.“I think winning whatever games we’re capable of winning is what we need to focus on. I don’t think we’ll focus on [the other two starters] until we get through [Moore] on Friday. From now on, every win is important, so I think we’re just going out there and focusing on that.”

Every day, we are faced with adversity. Whether it is rehabbing an injury or taking a test, our ability to overcome challenges and become a stronger person is tested by the world. Some people do not have the strength to fight through adversity, however, instead succumbing to the challenges before them.
Look at professional sports, for instance. In almost every professional league in the United States, there are players who show so much promise yet continually make the wrong decisions. Instead of manning up and admitting to the mistakes they have made, players more often than not make excuses and look for the easy way out.
Then there is Jake Olson. The longtime USC fan who will join the Trojan family this fall was born with retinoblastoma, a rare form of cancer in the retina. At 12 years old, Jake lost both of his eyes despite doctors’ best efforts to save at least one eye. Despite all this adversity, Jake never let his loss of vision get between him and his love for sports.
When former head football coach Pete Carroll heard about Olson’s battle with cancer, he invited the young Trojan fan to meet the team. Olson made the 45-minute trek from Orange County up to the USC campus, where he got to meet with players like Matt Barkley and Kristofer O’Dowd.
Over the next several years, Olson was an inspiration for the USC team. A staple at both practices and games, Olson used his relationship with the Trojans as a way help him through the challenge of losing his eyesight, never complaining about the difficult time he was enduring.
“There were nights of crying and stressful times when I couldn’t get the thought of going blind out of my psyche,” Olson told the Los Angeles Times. “But every time I was up at ‘SC or talking to one of the players or just being around, it was just pure fun. And, truthfully, pure peace.”
What’s more impressive about Olson is his drive to continue playing sports despite being blind. Just five days after he had surgery to remove his eyes, he was able to play center for his middle school flag football team with the help of guidance from his friends.
By the time he was a senior in high school, Olson had played varsity athletics in both football and golf for Orange Lutheran. He faced numerous challenges in becoming a varsity player, however.
Olson first approached Orange Lutheran coach Chuck Petersen after his sophomore year at the school. Petersen never imagined that Olson would follow up or show such extreme work ethic. Olson was able to overcome his deficiencies and eventually become the starting long snapper for the Lancers. Olson was even part of a game-tying field goal that capped off a massive comeback against rival Servite. Not one time did Olson ever complain about his blindness; instead, he adapted and overcame the challenge.
“I learned quickly that I need to use other senses and realized that by using these other senses that things were possible,” Olson said to the Los Angeles Times. “It wasn’t limiting, it was just a different way of doing it.”
A story like Olson’s just proves how strong the human spirit can be. The phrase “you don’t know what you have until it’s gone” speaks to me after hearing this story. So often we take for granted the privileges we have in front of us, even the simple ability to see, hear and speak. Only after we lose these abilities do we truly appreciate all that we have.
Like I pointed out before, athletes take their abilities for granted far too often. Think of the numerous players who could have been great but weren’t able to overcome addictions, made excuses for missing training, or chose to go down the wrong path à la Aaron Hernandez.
As the great John Wooden once said, adversity only makes us grow stronger. We must be challenged to improve, and adversity is the challenger. Think about that for a second. Jake Olson is the ultimate example of how adversity makes us stronger.  He was able to overcome the immense challenges presented to him and become an inspiration for an entire school.

The No. 3 USC women’s water polo team (21-3, 4-2 MPSF) heads to Tempe, Arizona, this weekend to begin postseason play in the MPSF conference tournament. Up first in the conference tournament for third-seeded USC is No. 6 seed San Jose State.
The Women of Troy are coming off a huge 9-5 loss to UCLA on April 18. Not too often has USC lost by such a large deficit this late in the season, especially with a 5-4 score going into the fourth quarter.
Head coach Jovan Vavic felt good about his team at that point.
“We were fighting to get back,” Vavic said. “We were down 4-1, and I felt the momentum was in our favor. With being down 4-1 and being in their pool, it looked like we were done. I thought we did a great job to score two goals in the third, making it a one goal game going into the fourth quarter. I felt we were in really good shape. I felt that this is where we wanted to be, a close game in the fourth quarter.”
But as Vavic explained, the tide turned very quickly for USC.
“What happened really was that when we had our chance in the first possession of the fourth quarter, we didn’t score the goal. We gave up an immediate goal, and the counterattack that happened after that possession really was huge for UCLA. It was really a killer because we gave up that goal immediately, and it kind of took the wind out of our sails after they scored that. And then the very next possession, same thing happened again. It really hurt us. They basically had a 7-4 lead with six minutes to go.”
Now the Women of Troy have to switch gears from regular season play to the conference tournament. And even after coming off a loss, they are still staying positive, knowing that there is a lot more water polo to be played.
“[We are staying positive by] just knowing that the season isn’t over. We still have six games to really make it happen, and dwelling on something like that isn’t gonna help us,” said senior Eike Daube.
Right now, the only team that the Women of Troy are dwelling on is San Jose State. USC beat the Spartans earlier this year at home in a 21-6 blowout. One would think it would be a similar result this time around, but last year USC lost in the first round to what many thought was an inferior Arizona State team. According to Daube, the Women of Troy have no plans to incur the same result this year.
“ASU beating us last year was probably one of the toughest losses we took last year,” Daube said. “I think we underestimated them in a lot of regards, and when we went into the game we weren’t having the same energy and approach to them as we would maybe UCLA or Stanford, but that’s something that we don’t plan on doing with [San Jose State]. I think we take every game very seriously.”
USC, without a doubt, has the capability of beating the Spartans, but to win the tournament they’ll most likely have to face both UCLA and Stanford. USC played close games against both teams until running out of gas near the end. Freshman goalie Victória Chamorro said this is a pattern that the team will have to eliminate.
“Towards the end, we are not as energetic as we are at the beginning, but that’s something that we are working to fix,” Chamorro said. “We are not going to be giving a lack of energy in these next games.”
If the conference tournament and a possible NCAA berth isn’t enough motivation, however, the Women of Troy will want to prove that they can beat their crosstown rival.
Daube said the team will be back to get even with UCLA.
“No one can take a loss very easy, and knowing that that’s our biggest rival, I think if you look back at it we’ve lost four consecutive games against them from last year going into this year, so I think it’s definitely time that we show them what we’re made of,” he said.

The No. 8 USC men’s volleyball team (18-8, 15-7 MPSF) has earned home-court advantage as the fourth seed in the MPSF tournament. The Trojans will host the No. 6 BYU Cougars (17-9, 14-8 MPSF), who hold the fifth seed in the MPSF. USC has won seven of their last eight games and has an 11-3 record at home.
Earlier this season, the Trojans hosted the Cougars on back-to-back nights, with the two teams splitting the matches. When they met previously, USC was ranked No. 2 and BYU was ranked No. 7. In the first game, the Trojans fought back from a two-set deficit to win the match in five. Junior outside hitter Alex Slaught led the team with a strong offensive performance and a career-high 24 kills. Freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta had a strong showing with 15 kills off the bench.
USC’s offense beat out BYU, even though the Trojans only had a .209 hitting percentage and BYU posted 20.5 blocks. In addition, USC’s serving was spectacular; the Trojans recorded 11 aces (BYU had none), and senior middle blocker Robert Feathers and Slaught each had four aces.
In the second game, BYU was out for revenge. Slaught again had a spectacular night with 19 kills, but BYU managed to maintain a handle over USC and beat the Trojans in four sets.
Head coach Bill Ferguson is optimistic about playing the Cougars in this weekend’s match. Ferguson pointed out that the two teams have had similar trajectories this season. Both teams started out on a dominating hot streak; USC won nine of their first 10 games (with an 8-0 start), and BYU won eight of their first 10 games.
Then, both teams hit a bit of a rough patch, but now they are both “getting together when it counts.”
“It’s cool as a competitor,” Ferguson stated. “It’s two teams on the rise coming to play each other.”
The team is excited to have the opportunity to play at home, and it’s significantly better than the alternative — playing in Provo in front of 6,000 BYU fans. Home-court advantage is much more than just playing in front of a home crowd: it’s being able to practice on the court, being familiar with everything and even sleeping in your own bed.
But it’s the playoffs, so there is definitely an added level of excitement for the team. Additionally, when BYU and USC met last year, the Cougars swept the Trojans in three straight sets. This year, the Trojans are looking to return the favor.
“It’s normal to have the juices get flowing with a match like this,” Ferguson explained.
For this team, being at home is a huge advantage. The Trojans have had some mental ups and downs throughout the season, so being able to have the comfortable routine of playing at home is a great boost which allows them to focus more on the match.
“Anything positive motivationally or environmentally is a good thing,” Ferguson said. “That’s human nature.”
The best motivating factor for the team is the fans. With the quick momentum shifts of volleyball, it is always helpful for a team to have support in the stands. This week, players have been encouraging their fans to come out to the match.
“At home you get the energy of the crowd,” Ferguson said. “They’re behind you.”
In front of the support of their home crowd, the Trojans will have to focus on themselves and on their mentality. One thing that the Trojans will specifically focus on is their serve-pass game. That’s what led to BYU winning the second match in the teams’ first series.
“They’re the first team to have handled our serving really well,” Ferguson explained. “It’s what decided it when we played them.”
The Trojans will look to piece everything together in front of a large, loud and energized crowd as they take on the Cougars at 7 p.m. on Saturday night at the Galen Center.

This will be my 54th and last column. In two years of writing, I’ve covered numerous policies, frequent congressional failures and rare congressional successes. I’ve been called an “O-bola-crat liberal” and compared to the dictators of Marxist totalitarian regimes, neither of which I plan to pursue as a job title. When I look back on writing, however, the most important lesson I’ve learned comes not from any particular column — it comes from those comments.
I probably won’t remember every detail of the success of the Affordable Care Act or the particular legal arguments against affirmative action, but I will remember the value of the debate and exchange of ideas on each of those issues. To this day, I still believe conversations among an enlightened citizenry are the bedrock of the functioning of a free, progressive society, and now, in my last column, I offer some parting thoughts on how to make those conversations better.
First, though the rise of social media has made it easier for dialogue, Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben is right: with great power comes great responsibility. Historically, political debates were held in person in front of a live audience. The only way to hear about them was to either show up or read about them in the newspaper the next day. When TV and then the Internet came along, those debates were suddenly in front of a virtual audience of millions — a great benefit, but also a great drawback. Fact is, TV and social media in particular won’t better us politically until we are still able to say to each other’s faces what we say to each other’s Facebook statuses and in published writing.
I’m guilty of this myself. Especially when I have a bone to pick, I find it easier to write about a particular issue, group or person and send it off to cyberspace than to stand in the quad with a megaphone and shout it to a gathered group of students. Politicians know this, too. On C-SPAN3, you’ll see speeches on the floor of the Senate or House of Representatives in front of an empty room. Watch a senator get interviewed on Fox News, and they’ll say things about people that they might not say if they were standing face-to-face. How many Republicans who have opted to deride gay marriage on television or in a newspaper article (as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal did yesterday), would do the same in a room full of gay people, or around their dinner table next to a gay family member?
If we aren’t willing to give our opponents the same virtual respect that we would give them in person, technology has failed us. In fact, it’s no wonder we aren’t willing to listen to our adversaries and our political system is plagued by a failure to compromise. Politics won’t be any less divided until we are willing to overcome this and embrace a culture of being accountable for what we say. Case in point? Republicans recently inserted language opposing abortion into a bipartisan bill designated to ramp up legal action against human traffickers. Democrats won’t vote for the bill anymore — but the catch? They didn’t notice Republicans had inserted the language until after the damage was done because they didn’t read the bill. That failure is an outgrowth of our inability to listen, and this trend must be reversed.
Particularly in political debates, we know that hypercharged speech sells — just ask Ann Coulter or Bill Maher. As a result of this social conditioning, we writers and speakers often gravitate toward the grandiose and melodramatic instead of putting our opponents in the most positive light possible. That’s why I think the challenge before journalists, politicians and a new generation of voters is to repackage our arguments in a way that is both interesting and respectful. After all, our opponents are people who care as passionately about the issues as we do, and that’s better than people who don’t care at all.
I usually try and conclude columns by returning to the ideas I outlined in the beginning, so it is only fitting that these two years of weekly writings end with a statement from my first column two years ago. I said, “The ideal outcome is not to increase the times we agree, but rather to make the times that we disagree more productive.” I offer these parting thoughts in support of the golden rule of arguing: disagree with others as you would have them disagree with you. To anyone who has read, commented or shared these writings over the last two years, thank you. I hope you have enjoyed my efforts to make folks more engaged and the state of our union stronger.

Gonna miss your insights, Nathaniel!

Most weekends in Buenos Aires are packed with unique opportunities in the city, one in particular being the “ferias” or fairs that you can find in almost every neighborhood.
These street fair style markets pop up every weekend in the same places and sell everything from food to fabrics. There are stalls that line the sidewalks of the different plazas in each neighborhood and everyone from tourists to locals relies on these for their shopping. The ferias are similar to a farmers market or flea market. The most well known and largest in Buenos Aires is the Feria de San Telmo, which extends for miles down through the the entire neighborhood every Sunday.Stalls selling all types of artisanal arts and crafts, clothes, tourist knick knacks, food and more run down both sides of the entire street which ends in a plaza that has even more booths. With the incredible number of vendors that can be found at this fair, there is, without a doubt, something for everyone.
Alana Victor | Daily Trojan
If shopping and street food are not enough for you, there are always many other special cultural opportunities. This past weekend in particular was full of festivities. The city hosted two festivals that are widely loved by Porteños,  “Masticar” and “BAFICI.”
Feria Masticar, which literally means “fair chew,” is a food festival that hosts the best chefs and most popular restaurants in Buenos Aires. The Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente, BAFICI, is a ten-day international film festival that screens movies both new and old from all around the world in different theater locations throughout the city. I was lucky enough to get a taste of both this weekend.
On Friday afternoon, some of my housemates and I explored Feria Masticar and were blown away by the amazing cuisine options and creative variations on traditional plates from the representing chefs. There was also a grocery section where local farmers were selling organic fruits, vegetables and a number of spices and sauces.
After thoroughly scouting all the booths, we decided the best approach would be to compile our vouchers and share a variety of small plates. We tried parilla pizza (barbecued pizza), bondiola (a steak sandwich), ceviche, a salmon dish, raspberry Nutella crepe and dulce de leche torta (cake). I would have to say my favorite was the salmon and grilled vegetables prepared by Jessica Lekerman, the head chef at Mooi.

While it sounds simple, the salmon was cooked to perfection and paired with a hybrid teriyaki balsamic sauce that was just flavorful enough while not overpowering the fish. Aside from all the amazing food, the overall setup created a perfect atmosphere. All the booths were accessible and each decorated to match the chef’s personal style, there was a local radio station playing music and a main stage where chefs would do live cooking shows. After walking around and grazing on incredible food, we didn’t think our day could get much better until the MC announced that it was National Malbec day and that there would be free wine samples for the rest of the evening. While it might not have been the best wine Argentina has to offer, it was fun to taste and see all the wine aficionados give their different opinions.
My weekend of festival exploration continued Saturday night at the Anfiteatro del Parque Centenario, one of the screening locations for BAFICI. This open air amphitheater, was screening “Only Lovers Left Alive,” a German film that was released in 2013. BAFICI has a variety of paid and free screening opportunities.
Alana Victor | Daily Trojan
I will be honest — my friend and I chose to go see this film solely around the free entry (the reality of the traveling student budget) and didn’t know much about the movie beforehand. That being said, I was extremely pleased with my experience as a whole.
In typical Argentine fashion the free event was extremely well attended, but we were able to find seats just in time for the start of the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, which presents the story of two vampire lovers who have lived ordinary human lives throughout several centuries. I know that when people hear vampires nowadays they often think of the Twilight series, but I strongly discourage any preconceived notions about this type of storyline and would definitely recommend this film.
Along with the captivating movie entertainment (shown in in English with Spanish subtitles), the open air and star-studded sky above combined with the energy of a packed amphitheater created a perfect atmosphere that makes me question why we would ever watch movies indoors.
There is truly never a dull moment in this city, and this weekend was no exception. With so much to do on weekends in particular, I am already wishing I had more time in Buenos Aires. Thankfully, with three months left, I will hopefully be able to see and explore as much as possible as I continue to learn of and experience more local activities.

When it comes to purchasing tuition refund, USC has an opt-out option. Or if you phrase it in a different way, USC doesn’t let you exercise your right to opt in; instead, it forces you to opt out. Have you ever thought about why that is?
Let’s compare our current situation of tuition refund to that of organ donation. In Germany, only 12 percent of the population are organ donors while in Austria, the participation rate is an astounding 99 percent. One would suspect that perhaps there was some kind of trick to this fact. Austria must spend tons more money advocating for people to sign up for its organ registry or Germany must be particularly bad at mobilizing people to become organ donors. The truth is, there is only one difference between the two countries, and it comes down to a simple design quirk: Austria forces you to opt-out, while Germany lets you choose whether you want to opt-in.
Opting out is an active form of decision-making, while opting-in is affected by things like human laziness. Remember when you said, “Oh I’ll do it later,” but never actually completed the task? The simple fact of the matter is, humans just don’t like making complex choices and prefer to defer to the default. The psychology behind this phenomenon is so simple, yet affects countries profoundly.
No matter what the situation, making the choice opt-out instead of opt-in will always lead to higher participation. In the US, Denmark, and Britain, automatic enrollment of employees in pension funds increased the rate of participation. While in Oregon, automatically registering people ages 18 and older to vote is expected to increase the number of voters by 300,000 people.
So, in the end, what it all comes down to is USC trying to take advantage of your brain’s aversion to making active choices. USC believes that it’s in your best interest to have some sort of insurance in case you need to drop out of college and maybe, subconsciously, your brain decides that that’s okay. So guess what? You now have tuition refund!

With May 1 fast approaching, you might be struggling to decide which college to commit to. Or maybe you were just perusing through The Daily Trojan website and want to reaffirm your decision. Besides the obvious academic prestige, here are 10 reasons why you should come to USC (or 10 reasons why you made the best decision of your life).
With daily temperatures in the 70’s and minimal rain, Southern California definitely has what I consider to be “perfect weather.” A bad day would constitute having to wear a jacket to class.

Campus is the perfect size. With walking as your mode of transportation, you can easily make it across campus in only 15 minutes, though biking or boarding cuts that time significantly.

If you’re looking for a big football school, USC is the place to go. Nowhere is this more evident than in the fact that tailgating sometimes begins as early as 6 a.m.
Photo courtesy of i2.wp.com
Alumni care so much about the school and do everything they can to give back. For example, they help out students with internships, jobs and scholarships all the time. Do not pass up an opportunity to make the best connections of your life!

Film crews are always on campus. You’ll definitely meet at least one celebrity during your time at USC or you’ll be in the background of a show or movie.

No matter what, you’ll always have at least one friend at USC: EVKitty. Known to everyone on campus, EVKitty has survived Yik Yak death rumors and continues to live it up in the courtyard of EVK.

There are super cool speakers and performances on campus every week! Actually maybe even daily. Just to name a few…we have had Jessica Alba, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Ian Somerhalder and 2 Chainz.

You’ll find your niche. Guaranteed. Whether it’s in the Greek community, a sports team, academic club or service group, you’ll fit in somewhere and develop lifelong friendships.

Last but not least, you cannot bike through campus without feeling like you belong on a brochure. USC’s campus is that beautiful.

When people talk about the infamous Coachella Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, they’re usually talking about the non-stop music or the inspiring art. Many, however, don’t take the time to really appreciate something else Coachella does a great job at…the food.  From street vendors to food trucks to even renewed restaurants, Coachella deserves an A+ for their delicious, though rather expensive, festival food.  If you’re thinking about going to Coachella next year, you need to try these foods you missed.
Miranda Mazariegos | Daily Trojan
1. Lamb Gyro
With lettuce, tomato, lamb and a yogurt-based sauce, this lamb gyro was definitely number one on our food list.
Miranda Mazariegos | Daily Trojan
2. Asian Salad Wrap
The Asian Salad is good enough on its own but wrapped inside a tomato tortilla wrap it was even better.  With just the right amount of sesame dressing and a lot of salted peanuts, this wrap is definitely one you don’t want to miss
Miranda Mazariegos | Daily Trojan
3. Brie-Pear Melt
Instead of ordering a traditional grilled cheese sandwich, you definitely need to try this brie-pear melt, found in the Sandwiches and Wraps booth. Two slices or artisan bread with brie-cheese, sliced pear, fig jam and arugula will have you adding this wonderful sandwich to your to-do list.
Miranda Mazariegos | Daily Trojan
4. Tacos
The taco booth is one of the least expensive food booths, plus, it is the one with the widest array of options.  From Tacos al Pastor to chicken tacos to even shrimp tacos, you can order almost anything – and with that extra lime juice, it will taste perfect.
As opposed to the Ultra, which is much about enjoying the music, Coachella has more to offer than the amazing music.  The art, chill atmosphere and wide array of food make it a festival you definitely don’t want to miss.
