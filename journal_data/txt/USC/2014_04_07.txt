The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, April 4, and Sunday, April 6. 
Crimes against a person
At 10:44 P.M. on April 5, DPS officers responded to a report of an intoxicated student punching security guards, who were attempting to remove him from a concert on McCarthy Quad after several witnesses complained that he was misbehaving while in the crowd. The student remained combative and had to be physically subdued by the officers. The security guards did not want criminal prosecution on the matter and an Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance  unit subsequently transported the student to Kaiser Permanente for treatment for injuries he sustained during the incident.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 3:44 p.m. on April 4, DPS officers responded to a report of two non-USC males taunting opposing fans during a tennis match at the David Marks Tennis Stadium and detained them for investigation. Both subjects appeared to be intoxicated and during questioning they admitted that they had been drinking. The officers then escorted the subjects out of the stadium and released them without further incident.
at 2:08 A.m. on April 5, Expo Park police detained three students who were observed sitting inside an illegally parked vehicle near the Exposition Park Rose Garden and during questioning they admitted that they intended to draw their fraternity emblem in chalk on the sidewalk outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The students were cited to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards by DPS officers who responded to the scene and were released.
at 7:16 p.m. on April 6, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a loose tooth when he struck his mouth on a bar while doing pull ups at the Lyon Center. The officers examined the student and transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment.

Electronic Arts Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wilson engaged in a candid conversation with students of USC’s School of Cinematic Arts Monday night about the future of the gaming industry and the executive’s rise to the top. The event took place in the Interactive Media Building during Professor Robert Nashak’s Business and Management of Games (CTIN 458) class, with Nashak giving Wison a brief introduction.
Challenge everything · Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts, stresses the importance of forming visions out of opinions to audience members during Monday’s event, which took place in the Interactive Media Building. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
The Australian-born Wilson was appointed CEO of EA in September 2013 after being asked to lead the resurrection of the FIFA soccer franchise in 2006. Sales of FIFA at EA had been lagging compared to its competition and market share continued to drop until Wilson took over and implemented a new strategy.
Wilson looked for designers and developers who were passionate about soccer and the sport’s influential role internationally in order to create a game with greater value. The result was a game that has transcended the entire sports gaming industry and along the way allowed EA to obtain 95 percent market share and create 1 billion dollars a year in business for the company.
The conversation also touched on what Wilson described as the four pillars of creative    leadership: having an affinity for an idea, forming a strong opinion on that idea, having the ability to turn that opinion into a vision for a better world and engaging people who will both create and buy the idea.
“If you’re unable to take the opinion and turn it into a vision for greatness, then your career will stop there,” Wilson said.
The CEO also spoke on his philosophical viewpoints of the world today which drew important parallels to not just the gaming industry but also entertainment as a whole.
“We are currently in a creative phase of humanity, where people are taking skills and utilizing them to bend rules and get outside of the parameters of what we are used to,” Wilson said. “Those who have creative sensibilities are changing the world that we live in today, for the better.”
Wilson used the WhatsApp founders and Uber’s on-demand taxi service as examples outside of gaming in which apps were created to disrupt old industries with new, creative ideas while also allowing their owners to monetize the business in the process.
Wilson also said that he sees the free-to-play gaming model as a part of the future of the industry in the United States, with this model already being utilized successfully in Korea at gaming company Nexon.
When further questioned on the business model of providing something of value for free, he noted the importance of spending time over spending money for the product.
“You will definitely need those who spend their money, but without a doubt also those who don’t spend their money [and] more importantly [spend] their time,” he said.
Though preoccupied with the responsibilities of being a CEO and the father of a 2-year-old daughter, Wilson noted he still manages to play video games once a week on a console and a mobile device to keep up with industry trends.
Nashak noted Wilson’s discussion was an influential experience for the students in attendance.
“He gave a practical and inspirational talk to our students on the future of the gaming industry,” Nashak said. “He also discussed ways games will be distributed and consumed in the future via mobile phones, laptops, traditional consoles and tablets. Students were told by a top gaming CEO to take the skills they are learning from school and enter into the gaming industry by becoming a disruptive force with fundamentally innovative ideas.”

“Michael Tilson Thomas stands among USC’s most distinguished alumni, and our students will benefit tremendously from his exceptional experience and expertise,” said USC President C. L. Max Nikias in a press release.
A Los Angeles native, Thomas studied piano, conducting and composing at USC under professors John Crown and Ingolf Dahl. He earned his bachelor’s degree from USC in 1967 and returned to complete a master’s in 1976. By age 19, he was music director of the Young Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra and worked with Igor Stravinsky and Aaron Copland, among others.
“We are thrilled to welcome Michael Tilson Thomas back to campus,” said Robert Cutietta, dean of Thornton, in a press release. “It is so meaningful that one of our outstanding alumni has such fond memories of his time at USC that he has decided to give back and impact today’s students.”
Thomas has recorded over 120 discs and has won 11 Grammy Awards and a Peabody Award for a radio series he created. In addition to his performance and conducting, Thomas is also committed to music education. He is the founder and artistic director of the New World Symphony, an orchestral academy that supports young musicians and prepares them to be leaders in orchestras and ensembles globally.
“I have always been honored to be a part of the USC family,” said Thomas in a press release. “My teachers at USC helped to mold and guide me, and I am grateful that I may be able to continue their tradition.”

“Bob Bradway stands among our nation’s leading executives in the field of biotechnology,” said USC President C. L. Max Nikias in a press release. “Under his visionary guidance, Amgen has significantly expanded its reach while continuing to provide tremendously innovative therapies that restore health and save lives. Mr. Bradway brings to our board his exceptional experience and expertise, as well as his commitment to applying research to better our society.”
Bradway, who holds a bachelor’s degree in biology from Amherst College and a master’s in business administration from Harvard University, worked as a healthcare investment banker for Morgan Stanley and was the managing director for the firm in London before joining Amgen in 2006 and rising to the position of chairman in 2013. He currently serves on the advisory board for the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.
“I think it’s great that we have a trustee who’s involved in the pharmaceutical industry,” said Ana Scuric, a freshman majoring in biochemistry. “When most people think of the pre-health field, they think of medicine, so it’s good to have other fields represented.”
The board of trustees is comprised of approximately 55 voting members, with one-fifth of the members elected each year for five-year terms.

Monday night, the Shoah Foundation Institute Student Association hosted a vigil in the University Religious Center in honor of the 20th anniversary of the day the Rwandan genocide began.
Remember, Unite, Renew · William Liao (left), a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention and biological sciences, and Alex Biniaz-Harris (right), a junior majoring in business administration and music, perform at the vigil on April 7. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
The Rwandan genocide occurred over a span of  approximately 100 days, from April to July, 1994; it was a mass killing of the minority Tutsis by the majority Hutus. The death estimates range from 500,000 to 1,000,000.
The vigil included a survivor testimony, a poetry reading, a traditional Rwandan dance ceremony and a piano-violin duet written by Ambrose Soehn after a trip to Rwanda in the summer of 2013. This will be the third event hosted by USC Genocide Awareness Month, which will continue throughout April.
To open the vigil, members of SFISA read testimonies from survivors of the genocide. One testimony came from Edouard Bamporiki, a young boy at the time of the genocide, whose family was part of the Hutu tribe.
“[The older Hutus] said, ‘If you want to be rich, come, kill, you will benefit from your work.’ I asked myself, ‘Was it true? Was the way to get rich to kill people and take their property?’” Bamporiki said in his testimony.
As an empathy exercise, SFISA handed out pictures of the 1 million who lost their lives during 100 days of genocide in 1994.
The vigil was entitled “Remember, Unite, Renew,” after the slogan of Kwibuka20, a series of global and national events launched by Rwanda for the 20th anniversary of the genocide. In Kinyarwanda, the word ‘kwibuka’ means ‘to remember.’ Not only did attendees remember the past, but they also celebrated the promising future in store for Rwanda.
Nora Snyder, president of SFISA, visited Rwanda with fellow students in the summer of 2013 and said the African country was nothing like it was during times of mass murder.
“When all of us got there, we were pretty blown away by Rwanda and how far the country has come,” Snyder said. “When people [in America] think of Rwanda, generally all they think about is the genocide … but, you got there and you see it for yourself, and that’s so far from the case. The country has come so far since 1994.”
USC Genocide Awareness Month’s next event, the “I Never Saw Another Butterfly Project,” will be held on Trousdale Parkway from April 21 through April 27.

USC junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor has made making people shake their heads — be it opposing players, coaches or fans — a habit during his two-year career at USC. He has big-play ability and explosiveness that few can match and, similar to former teammate Marqise Lee, watching him run with the ball in his hands is something to behold.
Stepping up · In his one game as interim head coach last season, Clay Helton led the Trojans to a 45-20 win over Fresno State. The win was instrumental in Steve Sarkisian retaining Helton as offensive coordinator. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
On Saturday, it was offensive coordinator Clay Helton that found himself shaking his head after Agholor caught a 75-yard touchdown pass from redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne. Though the play was perhaps the highlight of the practice session, it wasn’t Agholor’s athleticism that caught Helton off guard. Instead, Helton was displeased with the location of the throw, which drifted toward the sideline when it should have been more toward the center of the field. Despite the impressive end result, Helton offered Browne more instruction than praise following the completion.
“If you know me, and these quarterbacks will tell you, I’m a perfectionist,” Helton said. “At the end of the completion on the stat sheet, it says ‘completion,’ but you try to make everything perfect.”
Attention to detail has gotten Helton this far in his career, a career that started as a graduate assistant at Duke in 1995 and now has him as the offensive coordinator for one of the most storied programs in college football. In over 200 games of coaching at the college level, Helton has been an assistant in all but one — the exception coming during his brief stint last year as USC’s interim head coach.
Helton became USC’s third head coach of the 2013 season after Steve Sarkisian was hired and Ed Orgeron resigned. With only a few weeks to settle the chaos and prepare the Trojans for the Las Vegas Bowl, things could have easily turned south for him, but Helton kept his players focused amidst the chaos and led the team to a 45-20 victory over Fresno State, a performance that made an impression on many head coaches across the nation, including Sarkisian himself.
“What I was impressed with [regarding] Clay was that it was a difficult situation when I got hired,” Sarkisian said. “For Clay to stand up in front of that team and take the reins, I was so impressed by that alone. I was kind of blown away with how he handled it all, and I couldn’t not hire him. Then I had to fight to keep him. A lot of people were coming after him, but we were able to keep him, which was great.”
Helton was one of just two assistants Sarkisian chose to retain from the previous regime, along with wide receivers coach Tee Martin. Helton was an integral part in the development of redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler last season, and following Kiffin’s departure, he served as the team’s offensive playcaller. In USC’s final nine games of the season, the team averaged 31.8 points and 410.9 yards per game en route to a 7-2 finish.
Given the relationships Helton forged with the players and the results he was able to get out of them, the decision to retain him, Sarkisian says, was an easy one, and one that will help facilitate and expedite the installation of Sarkisian’s new offensive scheme.
“Clay is a good football coach,” Sarkisian said. “He’s bright, he’s detail-oriented, he’s demanding. He’s a really good football coach, not only on the field but off the field. He’s an organized guy that knows what he’s looking for and knows what he wants from his coaches and his players. He’s doing a really good job.”
It might seem that convincing Helton to return to his assistant position, after having success as the head coach, would be a tough task. But Helton asserts that his priority was staying at USC, a place where he had served as an assistant since 2010 after a 10-year stint at Memphis. Helton also insists that there is no awkwardness between him and Sarkisian following Helton’s demotion back to an assistant position.
“I absolutely love being a part of the USC Trojan staff, working for Coach Sarkisian,” Helton said. “To [work with] a guy that is so brilliant and offensively minded, to be a part of this system again and help in any role that I can is very satisfying and very rewarding. I’m glad to be a USC Trojan.”
USC players and fans should also be thankful that Helton is a Trojan, and should enjoy Helton’s guidance while it lasts. Because the more points the Trojans are able to put on the scoreboard this upcoming season, the more likely the possibility that Helton lands another head coaching gig somewhere else.
When that time comes, hopefully his second chance lasts longer than his first.

USC baseball broke its five-game conference losing streak this past Sunday with an impressive 8-7 victory over the Arizona State Sun Devils at Packard Stadium in Tempe, Ariz. The Trojans faced tough losses during the first two games of the series, falling 5-3 on Friday and 10-9 in eleven innings on Saturday.
Steady hand · Junior infielder Dante Flores went 3-for-5 against Arizona State on Sunday, and will look to improve his .243 batting average today. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Though the Trojans missed a few key opportunities that could have altered the ending to Friday and Saturday’s games, USC head coach Dan Hubbs feels that last weekend’s series represents a dramatic improvement in terms of clutch hitting and scoring runs.
“Sunday we scored all eight runs in the first five innings, which isn’t something we’ve been able to do recently,” Hubbs said. “Usually we’re battling from behind, trying to get big hits in the eighth or ninth inning. Now, instead of trying to let the game come to us, we need to start trying to force teams into mistakes and be a little bit more aggressive; that way, we can continue to put innings together like we did Sunday.”
On both Saturday and Sunday, the Trojans’ hit total reached double figures. On Sunday, they managed to make eight runs out of 15 hits. Junior infielder Dante Flores had the most notable performance during Sunday’s match, going 3-5 at the plate as well as driving in two  runs for the Trojans.
Hubbs believes the progress in team hitting has come from an improvement in the team’s confidence when entering the batter’s box.
“It’s taken some time for the kids to develop a bit of an identity and offense, but we managed to find that this weekend,” Hubbs said. “We had some big hits during important moments and a lot of that has to do with mentality when they come up to the plate.”
Hoping to continue with their new hitting success, the Trojans will travel to Malibu, Calif. today to take on the Pepperdine Waves for the second time this season. USC lost 10-4 to Pepperdine during the two teams’ first meeting at Dedeaux Field exactly four weeks ago.
Five Pepperdine players are currently batting over .300, headlined by Aaron Barnett, who’s hitting .353.
Pepperdine currently boasts a 24-7 overall record, including a 13-4 record at home, and holds a .286 team batting average, as well as a 2.24 team ERA this season. The Waves are also riding a seven-game winning streak that  includes series sweeps of Saint Mary’s and Portland as well as a lose 4-3 victory over UC Irvine.
Despite the Waves’ impressive record and top-notch pitching staff, Hubbs feels the Trojans can compete if they play to their full potential and trust their instincts.
“We know that we can beat a good team on the road; we’ve proven that time and time again,” Hubbs said. “We know that we can come back against anyone. Now, we just need to try to continue that against a very good Pepperdine team tomorrow, whose pitchers hardly give up anything. It’ll be a good test for us to see how far we’ve come offensively.”
Sophomore pitcher Brett Wheatley will start on the mound for the Trojans today.
Hubbs emphasizes the importance of a strong start against Pepperdine and the need for more consistency among the Trojans’ starting nine.
“One of the most frustrating parts of the past few weeks has been our lack of quality starts, which has really impacted and tired out our bullpen,” Hubbs said. “Normally a bullpen gets seven to eight innings per weekend and ours gets 20. If we get a good start tonight and do what we’re capable of doing, it’s going to be a tight and low-scoring game.”

Since the age of 12, Ioanna and Stephania Haralabidis have been terrorizing opponents on the water polo scene. Before the freshman drivers arrived on the defending national champion USC women’s water polo team, these twin sisters — hailing from Athens, Greece — have created havoc at many different levels of competition. But water polo was not always the target sport for the twins, and without an incredible influence the dynamic duo may never have had the chance to embrace their terrific talents.
Switch it up · Freshman driver Ioanna Haralabidis says she and her twin sister wouldn’t be succeeding at USC if not for the help from their mother, who supported them in switching from swimming to water polo. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
Though they didn’t get involved with water polo until they were 12, the Haralabidis twins were far from strangers to the pool. Throughout more than eight and a half years swimming, the sisters found their strokes — Ioanna with butterfly and Stephania with backstroke — and excelled in competition.
“We were always first, second place. We were really, really fast swimmers,” said Stephania, the younger of the two by about a minute. “We were going to be on the senior national swimming team, but we never really liked swimming. Going to practices we would cry to our mom, ‘We don’t want to go! We don’t want to go! We don’t like swimming!’ And then one day my older sister was like, ‘Mom, I’m done with swimming. I don’t like it anymore.’ And she was like, ‘OK. Let’s try another sport.’”
Ioanna — called Joe by her sister and teammates — was not surprised by her mom’s reaction.
“We always whined, but my sister never whined,” said Ioanna about her 20-year-old sister, Anastasia. “She liked the practices, so suddenly when she didn’t like it, my mom said it was enough so we went to water polo.”
After playing for years, Anastasia decided to forego the student-athlete process and currently attends the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada.
As big an influence as their older sister was, both Ioanna and Stephania singled out their role model without any hesitation: their mother, Janet Scott.
“She is so amazing. I don’t know what I would do without her,” Ioanna said. “I wouldn’t be here without her. She did everything to make us be here.”
Stephania mirrored her sister’s admiration for their mother.
“We wouldn’t have gone so far in our career with water polo because of her and wouldn’t have accomplished so many things without her,” Stephania said. “I have never met such a person that has done such great things for other people and doesn’t want anything for [herself].”
Scott now lives in Canada, and though she hasn’t seen her girls play at the collegiate level yet, she plans on attending the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and NCAA tournaments.
Reinforced by their mother’s dedication, which included chauffering the phenom freshmen from tutoring to school to practice each day, both of the standouts found their path onto the national stage. As members of the Greek Junior National team, the two claimed gold medals at the Junior European Championships in both 2011 and 2012 before capturing bronze as a part of the Women’s Senior World Championship team in China in 2012.
“The first time I felt I was going somewhere with water polo is when I was on the national team,” said Stephania, who is USC’s second-leading scorer this season. “When we were 16, we won first place in the championship in Spain, and I won MVP in that championship … I just felt like, ‘Now I am going somewhere. Now I am going to have some accomplishments in this sport, and I can look in the future with greatness in this sport.’ It was just a big moment in my life.”
Constantly bombarded with school and sport, every student-athlete has his or her own mechanism to relieve stress. Though they are similar in many ways, Ioanna and Stephania see this as their biggest difference.
“She loves going out. I like going up to new people and talking to them, while she is more shy toward  them, but she likes socializing a lot more —  going out with her friends,” Ioanna said of her sister. “I like mostly just relaxing and maybe just [reading]my book, or something.”
When they’re not working out in the pool, the twins enjoy watching TV in their shared dorm.
“I love watching crime shows, like the killing and how to solve it,” said Stephania, the agreed-upon messier of the two. “Dexter, romance, comedy, I watch everything. Except for thrillers. They scare me so much.”
Despite the variety of teams played for and people they have encountered, the sisters are still looking for the right nickname to catch on.
“Our coach, mostly everyone that we met, they called us the bullets,” Ioanna said. “Especially here, they use these a lot. ‘Hey, Greeks. Hey, twins.’”
The twins have certainly earned their nicknames as the bullets. Stephania has scored 43 goals in USC’s 22 games this season, while Ioanna has scored 26. But their teammates also have a more affectionate nickname for the tandem.
“They call us Joe-Seph because of Joe and Steph, they combine the two names, but I’m not sure,” Stephania said. “I’m not good with that stuff.”
Helping to guide the Women of Troy to a 21-1 record in their first season at USC is an impressive feat, but the sisters’ sights are set on retaining the title of National Champions. Admitting that an Olympic medal (which they hope to attain in the 2016 Summer Olympics) may slightly top the NCAA championship in significance, both agree that an NCAA title would be an incredible achievement in their first year at USC.

Minimalism, a multi-genre artistic movement associated with the turbulent 1960s and ’70s, has made a comeback at the Los Angeles Master Chorale’s second Minimalist Jukebox Festival. Minimalism describes a calculated reduction in form or musical elements, such as rhythm, melody and harmony. The movement was a reaction against the complicated and separated art forms — it aimed to unite and democratize the arts. Minimalist compositions, much like minimalist visual art, are simple, repetitive and generally pleasing. These uncluttered compositions are spare and deceptively simple, and can be appreciated by casual listeners as well as art connoisseurs. In addition, minimalist compositions have a meditative quality yet retain the emotional impact of more elaborate pieces.

The Los Angeles Chorale’s second Minimalist Jukebox Festival celebrates minimalism in many musical forms. John Adams, creative chair and minimalist pioneer, arranged the festival as an interdisciplinary exploration of minimalism. The monthlong event includes museum exhibitions, dance performances and concerts across Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles Master Chorale joined the celebration on Monday, April 7. The Master Chorale’s concert featured American composers Steve Reich and David Lang and opened with a pre-minimalist work attributed to Pérotin, a French composer. The program showed a breadth of minimalist works.
“Look at the ways the pieces are different and ask why we group them together … [Minimalism] has more differences than similarities,” Los Angeles Master Chorale Director Grant Gershon said.
The Los Angeles Master Chorale opened the concert with a moving rendition of Tomás Luis da Vittoria’s “Ave Maria.” The chorale dedicated this beautifully haunting song to the late Paul Salamunovich and the audience observed a moment of silent remembrance. Salamunovich, who died on Thursday, was the chorale’s music director emeritus from 1991-2001 and was an adjunct professor at USC’s Thornton School of Music.
The chorale transitioned into Sederunt principles, “The Princes Sat.” Composed around the year 1200, the composition is one of the earliest surviving precursors to minimalism. Even though the composer is difficult to pinpoint, scholars credit Pérotin with the work. The men’s choir’s only piece drew on the tradition of Gregorian chant and used text from Psalm 118. Pérotin adds sonic layers to the consistent tenor line, creating an organa quadruple, a musical arrangement for four voices. Gershon described this piece as a precursor to minimalism because “[it] takes snippets of music and creates interlocking patterns over a slowly moving harmony.”
The concert continued in a somber mood with David Lang’s “little match girl passion.” Lang’s piece draws from the Hans Christian Andersen story by the same name and alludes to Johann Sebastian Bach’s grand “St. Matthew Passion.” The Master Chorale’s 2011 performance of this piece stunned critics, but “little match girl passion” truly shines alongside other minimalist works. The story of the little match girl is interspersed with commentary choruses, allowing the audience to experience the narrative both directly and indirectly. Lang used additive repetition — building on simple, repeated melodies — and adds cold-sounding chords to portray the little match girl’s suffering.
“There are no overt musical quotes to Bach, but it shares the same characteristics — there is nothing baroque about this piece — the austerity of it is what makes it so moving,” Gershon said.
The minimalist movement centers on breaking conventions and subverting boundaries between artistic categories; thus, Lang’s “little match girl passion” is an excellent example of minimalism. Not only does it adhere to minimalistic techniques, but it also blends musical and literary forms, while demonstrating the power of simplicity. “little match girl passion” is a wrenching tale of suffering, and it reinforces the idea that art does not need to be complicated to be emotionally effective.
The concert closed with Reich’s “You Are (Variations),” each of the four movements providing a subtly different setting of the melodic theme. Reich’s piece wove four piano lines into an intricate yet spare accompaniment. This provided a rich, striking sound and matched the energy in the vocal line and percussion. Similar to the repeated musical motifs, the text was also reprised, both in English and in Hebrew. Reich’s deeply spiritual piece falls into an informal subsection of minimalism called “holy minimalism,” which became prominent in 1990. This emotionally buoyant piece provided an uplifting end to the concert.
Minimalism reaches beyond the Western canon of baroque music — Bach and Vivaldi — in favor of Eastern and contemporary musical movements. Even though this movement has a calculated, intellectual quality, it is a key component in popular music. Rock and pop bands, such as Velvet Underground and Spiritualized, were early adopters of minimalist techniques. The repetitive, hypnotic musical motifs of minimalism are most notable in Electronic Dance Music and techno.
Though it might sound like a stretch to classify dance music and dubstep DJs as minimalists, these styles of music share the same qualities as the compositions performed in the Minimalist Jukebox Festival. Unlike Baroque or orchestra-specific techniques, however, minimalism can easily be transferred and reused in different art forms. It is also reminiscent of the scientific theory Occam’s Razor, which suggests that the most succinct or elegant solution is generally the best choice. The Master Chorale’s performance supports this theory — sometimes the simplest music is the most beautiful.

Not a stretch at all to see the connection between Steve Reich and EDM.

The USC Fashion Industry Association Fashion Showcase treated a well-heeled crowd to an evening filled with glamour as the organization celebrated its tenth anniversary Sunday night at the Midtown Radisson Hotel.
FIA is an organization under the Marshall School of Business. It prides itself on serving the community of USC as a resource for education and opportunities in the fashion industry and is the only fashion organization at USC.
“We help students realize their potential in the fashion industry,” said FIA CFO-President Vi Nguyen.
FIA brought together an eclectic mix for the showcase. A variety of participants showcased their collections, from up-and-coming designers to well-known brands, such as ASOS and Romeo & Juliet Couture. LOFT also presented its spring collection, as well as sponsored various giveaways, including a 250 dollar gift card.
Unlike a runway show, where models walk down a catwalk that is surrounded by the audience on both sides a showcase is a much more personal experience, in which the designer takes advantage of a smaller room to allow the audience to take in the detail of the designs while also giving an explanation as to what the inspiration behind the collection was or why he or she chose to highlight certain trends. Typically, retail store buyers and members of the press frequent showcases, as it is usually a designer’s preview before a much larger event.
Eight different brands displayed their work during the hourlong show. The models walked through the audience before making their way onto the stage, where a representative from each designer gave a short blurb about the concept behind the collection and the brand. Most of the models were USC students who attended a casting call organized by FIA.
In attendance was a mixture of USC students, graduates and family members, as well as Los Angeles-based fashion bloggers who members of FIA reached out to. VIP attendees received “swag bags” filled with items from the showcase’s sponsors. If the fashion onstage did not attract an attendee’s eye, then the outfits worn by those in audience certainly did. From leather and lace to thigh-high slits and wood cork heels, attendees clearly heeded FIA’s suggestion to dress chic.
PT & LO, a crowd favorite, is a startup brand headed by two FIDM graduates PT Nguyentang and Loren Chavez. For designer Chavez, the FIA Showcase was the perfect opportunity to bring awareness of the brand to a new audience.
“We decided to show here tonight because I’m a recent graduate from FIDM and we needed a way to showcase our designs and collection,” Chavez said. “What’s a more perfect way than showing out here?”
Their spring/summer 2014 collection, entitled “Eclectic Paradise,” combined modern silhouettes with bold tropical floral prints and colors. Much of the collection centered around the pairing of a bandeau or crop top with a fitted pencil skirt. The individual pieces, however, are basic and timeless, making them very easy to mix and match them.
Among the other trends seen at the showcase were dusty pinks and neutrals from LOFT, statement necklaces from Chloe + Isabel and printed shift dresses from Zoe Miyori Fuji, a local designer based in Long Beach, Calif. Actually, Fuji introduced the crowd to a new print that will probably catch on soon: the Dalmatian print, a modern spin on beloved polka dots.
Closing out the showcase was a short presentation by Dónde, a new mobile app that provides a new way to search for fashion items seen on the street or in magazines without taking pictures.
Overall, the evening was a wonderful success. The clothes and jewelry were beautiful and no doubt encouraged someone to seek more information on a brand to buy a piece. A few lucky members of the audience also won prizes raffled off by FIA. After the show, attendees had the opportunity to network with some industry professionals in the ballroom. With some companies seeking summer interns, someone might not have walked away with a raffle prize, but they could have received a job offer. And there is no better consolation prize than that.

Being sick is the worst. Instead of frolicking in the sunshine last weekend (c’est la vie, USC Springfest 2014 and CicLAvia), I was in bed, with only a copious amount of Kleenex and my Netflix account for comfort. That left me with plenty of time to troll the Internet and write a lot of whiny 140-character posts on Twitter, where, incidentally, I happened to come across a tweet about an L.A. bucket list.
The article that the tweet linked to listed the heavy hitters in the city, the kind of landmarks that are great to see if you’re green behind the ears here.
Because I’m getting ready to accept my diploma (40 days and counting), I think the idea of making my own personalized bucket list resonated. So, stuck in my room, I started dreaming about the places that I want to return to before embarking on the Wild West that is graduation. And, since I didn’t go anywhere more exciting than Fresh & Easy this weekend, I thought I’d share the top five items on my list with you:
Thrifting on York Boulevard
I wrote about this street in Highland Park before, back when I had no idea what York Boulevard was, or that it was the new Echo Park, which was then being dubbed the new Silver Lake. At the time, I barely knew what Silver Lake was. But I soon learned that Highland Park was becoming an affordable frontier for the socially conscious and trendy, the people who were trying to get away from the constantly rising rent that had already hit Silver Lake and was starting to pervade the prime real estate in Echo Park.
To write the article, I spent a wonderful week tramping up and down Avenues 50 to 52, poking my nose into the small boutiques. If my eyes were Pinterest, I internally hearted enough items to furnish a large house. You can also have your cake and eat it too on York Boulevard, as the food there is as good as the shopping.
Midnight at the Santa Monica Pier
I know, almost everyone reading this has “done” Santa Monica. It’s a “thing,” and a good one at that. But not as many have come late at night, when the crowds have finally emptied, and the distinctive taste of tourist has dissipated from the air. Then the beauty of the area really comes into focus. Go on a warm night, bring a blanket and an iPod and find somewhere to park your car (good luck). If you stay late enough, the lights on the ferris wheel actually do turn off, and then you’re left alone, with only the stars and the surf for company. There’s not much more anyone can ask for.
Hollywood Farmers Market
I love farmers markets. I’m from Ventura and there’s something wonderful about driving the 101 through Camarillo, taking in the tilled rows of land, which stretch for miles. I love the smell of the earthy fertilizer. I love being able to buy just-picked produce on the side of the road (read: strawberries). The farmers markets here give me that sense of home and fresh food. I’ve made a point to visit as many farmers markets in Los Angeles as possible during my time here. The Hollywood one is my favorite. It’s so big and full of personality. The location, of course, adds its own sense of drama, as you’re literally buying oranges under the Hollywood sign. For me, it’s a Sunday must, complete with good grub, good music and good vibes.
Take a walk on West Third Street
No, not the Santa Monica one (though there’s plenty to do there, too). West Third Street is located between the Grove and the Beverly Center and is lined with independent boutique stores and restaurants. Stop for lunch at Joan’s on Third, poke your nose into Magnolia Bakery –— and try the banana pudding -— and then peruse the small independent boutiques and businesses. It’s walking-friendly and has a relaxed village atmosphere that will feel “so L.A.”
Griffith Observatory
Yes, I know, the Griffith Observatory is on every definitive list of Los Angeles attractions, but it holds that place for a good reason. When I imagine Los Angeles, I imagine the Griffith Observatory. Visiting it feels like walking on hallowed ground. Rebel Without a Cause filmed some of its most iconic scenes at the observatory, and whenever I go, I always flash back to that scene when Jim played by James Dean, and Plato played by Sal Mineo, struggle with the gun outside of the building. It’s a powerful scene, befitting of the flair of the architecture and setting it was shot in.
Somehow, the observatory manages to balance being a historic L.A. monument while also being a storied filming location. That ability to embody reality and fiction is what makes it a perfect fit for this city. Inside the observatory, Leonard Nimoy’s wonderfully deep voice narrates space and time. Outside, one has to consciously decide whether to look down at the city skyline or up at the cosmos. There’s nothing quite like it, and that’s why it is No. 1 on my bucket list. Los Angeles is for dreamers, and where better to be inspired here than in the place dedicated to the stars?

In just 50 days, two USC students have built an app, partnered with Samsung, and launched their product in Spain at the Mobile World Congress, the largest mobile event across the globe.
USC student Karthik Gollapudi and USC alum Evan Tann have created an app called iwunta, which they believe is the first true social network.
Gollapudi, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, said that the real purpose of a social network is to bring people closer to their friends.
“If you think about it, Facebook is past tense, what happened at last night’s party. Snapchat and Twitter are present tense, what is happening right now,” Gollapudi said. “But if a social network is supposed to bring you closer to your friends, it has to be future tense to actually help you foster new relationships. That’s where we come in.”
Iwunta is designed to help make last-minute plans for anything spontaneous. The user first selects what he or she wants to do, such as working out or getting coffee. Then iwunta will find friends that are nearby to go with the user in one tap. A user will choose a friend group to invite, the time and the event activity. If the user sets the time for the event in an hour, the app will send the message only to friends within a one mile radius. If the user wants to go to the beach in a few hours, the app will send it to all of his or her friends within the city.
The friends will receive a message about the event and will have the option of downloading a group chat. Even if the user sends the request to 100 friends, it will not send to all 100 at once. It would start with one’s closest friends, and if no one responds, it will continue sending to a broader and broader group. The user will only hear back from those who say yes, so you only hear positive feedback.
Gollupudi said he appreciates that the app provides location-based messaging without revealing your friends’ locations.
“It never reveals the location of the people you are contacting so you don’t have to infringe on anyone’s privacy,” Gollupudi said.
Gollapudi and Tann partnered with Samsung in January, and joined Samsung in Spain for the Mobile World Congress. At the event, Samsung globally released its new Gear 2 wearable device and featured iwunta as one of its main apps. Iwunta was featured adjacent to the CNN mobile app.
“It was buzzing with activity and it was really incredible that Samsung featured us on their device and has been working with us,” Tann said. “We’ve been building technology for them ever since.”
Now the pair is talking to global partners and working to get distribution across the planet. They are now venture-funded out of Silicon Valley and have key angel investors, private investors who bring monetary value, powerful connections and have incredible experience building companies and serving as advisors. They designed the product on iOS for iPhones, Android and the Galaxy Gear 2 watch, so that if someone receives an iwunta the user can respond to it on any device. They plan to release iwunta to all of USC on April 9.
Gollapudi and Tann first designed the app after Tann met with an investor at the Consumer Electronic Show, the world’s largest electronic show in Las Vegas. The investor suggested that Tann should start building messaging on wearables. Tann and Gollapudi were classmates together at the time in one of USC Professor Ashish Soni’s courses. They quickly began to brainstorm ideas about how to make messaging work on a wearable watch, which has a one-inch screen, no speaker and no keyboard.
They believe that building off this small wearable device was the best thing for the app, since it produced a design that was easy.
“One of the reasons we have an advantage is because our app is clean and simple, since we started with wearables,” Tann said, “we focused on very core features and traveled backwards onto the mobile phone, whereas most people build for the phone first.”
For Trojans interested in tech entrepreneurship, Tann recommends getting started quickly. The two learned the coding language for the app and built their first version in just two weeks during the school year. They also encourage USC students to seek help through a professional advisor.
“Find somebody you really respect in the industry. Reach out to them. Show them that you really value their advice and that you really care about what they have to say by following through with everything they suggest,” Tann said. “Follow through 110 percent beyond their expectations.”
Tann said that drive helped them attract their chairman, Wendell Brown. Wendell has been in the startup industry for almost 30 years, and he’s had incredible successes. His past two companies have been sold to Microsoft and AOL. He cofounded LiveOps, which has made more than 150 million dollars in annual revenue.
Gollapudi recommends starting early and finding good people to work with along the way.
“Literally just start building. I think the biggest component is making sure you’re having fun doing it. Find people you really like working with,” Gollapudi said. “Start building things first because you honestly can’t iterate just on ideas.”
“Get out there and start building,” Tann said. “Chances are if you push yourself hard enough, and you’re willing to put in the hours, you can. That’s how you’re going to move faster than anybody else, and that’s what it’s going to take to beat others in the industry.”
“I think the most valid excuse would be, ‘I don’t know what I’m doing,’ but no one does,” Gollapudi said. “To be honest, we don’t know what we’re doing a lot of the time. We didn’t even know Objective C, which is a language that all iPhone programs are written in. We didn’t know that the day we started on this app so it’s a matter of getting out there, doing it, and learning it on the fly.”
Tann also emphasized the importance of being malleable.
“Don’t fall in love with the idea, either. A lot of people have ideas that they think are brilliant and are going to be perfect, and it’s never the case — no matter how good you are,” Tann said. “Facebook, when it first started, was essentially a phone book for colleges and it grew a lot from there. You can’t know where to grow until you get it into the hands of users and start asking for their feedback. Fall in love with a solution and helping people — not a specific idea.”
“We have a lot more to do,” Gollapudi said. “So far we’ve built a product but now it’s time to build a company. Now it gets busy.”

Though taking a gap year after high school is looked down upon in U.S. culture, colleges in the United States have been taking strides to reverse the stigma against gap years. Colleges such as University of North Carolina, Princeton University, Tufts University and others have begun implementing indispensable programs that encourage students to take a gap year for traveling and volunteering around the world, according to NBC News.
A multitude of colleges have created programs with the intention of eliminating students’ financial issues as a barrier from exploring global communities and getting out of their comfort zones before college. In 2009, Princeton University began offering applicants need-based aid for their gap year activities. At Princeton University, nearly 100 students have participated, volunteering in Brazil, China, India, Peru and Senegal. The University of North Carolina offers $7,500 to gap year applicants for similar pursuits. Tufts University’s gap year program will pay for housing, airfare and even visa fees, which can often add up to $30,000 or more. More and more students are beginning to take part in such programs, with approximately 40,000 American students taking part in gap year programs in 2013 — a 20 percent increase compared to past years, according to NBC News and data collected by the American Gap Year Association.
The typical United States high school student pushes him or herself to the breaking point in order to get that perfect SAT score and GPA solely for the purpose of getting into a “good college,” a term proven to be extremely relative. Students have shut themselves off from the outside world in order to achieve this goal. Opportunities such as gap year programs enable students to see the world outside the classroom — the place in which they will be a full participant in post-grad. As a result, not only do students return to school more focused, self-reliant, aware and confident, but they also become part of the global movement to improve the world through their volunteering throughout the gap year.
Lydia Collins, a 19-year-old freshman studying international relations at Tufts University, is just one example of how taking a gap year can prove life-changing.
“A lot of kids are very burnt out after high school,” Collins, who took a gap year in Ecuador, told NBC News. “Taking this time to be with yourself and see yourself in a new community and light will only help you to succeed in college.”
Students who take gap years have a leg up on students who have not been able to see the world from an alternative perspective; they have more real experience to convey when applying to internships or jobs throughout college and beyond, versus other first-year college students.
With the job market as competitive as ever, standing out from the crowd is imperative for career success — and taking a gap year is one way to do just that. Beyond career development, however, the personal growth and sense of fulfillment and purpose a gap year can provide students is unparalleled. There is no better time to see the world than when students are young. After college, students rush to find jobs and exploring the world is typically put on the back burner. Taking advantage of these developing programs and opportunities at colleges would serve as an unforgettable and beneficial experience for many college students and the world as a whole.

I don’t think it is looked down upon at all in the US. In fact, Harvard and MIT have encouraged their students to do so way before it became trendy. They felt the students who took gap years did much better than those who started college straight from high school.mthe President of Hr are has a message in their website all about the positive effects of a gap year. A friend of mine majoring in physics at MIT took her gap year and went to the Cordon Bleu to learn how to make chocolate and pastries…. She loved it so much so she wanted to pursue a career as a chef. However, she was also smart enough to realize she had an a incredible love of physics as well. Now she bakes lots of goodies for her classmates during finals and even parlayed her skills into a mini-business!

On personality quizzes, I’m always at a loss as to how to answer specific questions about myself. The answers are all so black and white. I’m sometimes extroverted but sometimes a bit of a hermit. I can be very understanding but also very stubborn. And when it comes to boxers or briefs, I haven’t the faintest idea. One facet of my life I’m completely sure of, however, is that when it comes between choosing between being a morning or night person, I am most certainly a night owl.

That’s why, even when I was a little kid, I loved late-night talk shows. Part of this was being allowed to stay up past my bedtime to laugh along with my parents at jokes I didn’t even understand. Another part of it was because of the deep respect I had for the hosts. They all had wildly attractive charisma, inviting audiences from around the world to their programs. We watched Conan O’Brien, Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel and, later, Jimmy Fallon. David Letterman, however, was my favorite, with his resonating chuckle and genuine interest in the lives of not just celebrities, but common people as well.
Letterman announced his retirement on Thursday, stating he would be vacating his position in 2015, according to CNN. Though it was something that I had been expecting, it deeply saddened me, as his persona as a television figure had influenced my entire life. His legacy as a comedy king is founded upon a strong admiration for New York City, his sardonic and self-deprecating humor and his friendly relationships with his celebrity guests. Letterman is undoubtedly irreplaceable, and I couldn’t help but wonder who could fill his place — and my void.
As I was hypothesizing possible replacements and comparing network line-ups, it occurred to me that none of the late-night talk show hosts on major cable television are women. What further bothered me was the decision not to employ women for late-night comedy. There are so many women working in comedy, among them Ellen DeGeneres, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler— all of whom did exceptional jobs this year hosting major award ceremonies, entertaining and garnering record numbers of viewers. They prove that, contrary to some beliefs, women can be as funny as, or even funnier than, their male counterparts.
If the problem is that women can’t meet the edginess of late-night humor, then viewers should look to Chelsea Handler. Handler offers her biting insights into many of her vices in her books and on her E! talk show, which she recently announced she would be leaving when her contract expires at the end of 2014. She often banters with her guests and is not afraid to be bluntly observational. The timing for Handler to become Letterman’s successor is perfect, and what excites me is that she is a forerunner in the mix of the people CBS is considering. Her name, however, is still being tossed around with all, albeit brilliant, male humorists.
Obviously, women can be just as funny as men. The comedians mentioned above don’t even scrape the list of women who make me laugh in the entertainment industry. Moreover, a woman should replace Letterman because it is the perfect remedy for conformity. Often, taking risks in the entertainment industry, which in this case is sad and not a novel idea, might result in warm or appalled reception. To stay safe and select someone that fits the mold of an institution is the most superficial way to garner ratings. Staying away from choosing female hosts for late-night, whatever the primitive reason might be, is simply ignoring the dimension women could add to the comedy landscape. There are obvious aforementioned candidates who all have tremendous backgrounds and success in comedy. It’s hard to think that in this day and age, having a female late-night talk show host would be considered revolutionary. It’s time for television to step out of that comfort zone and embrace the need for change.
It’s going to be a difficult period for me as Letterman says his goodbye, as I feel like I’ve known him my entire life. He has inspired me in many ways, but I’m optimistic about what Letterman’s decision will bring to the late-night landscape. Hopefully, changes will be made and executives will consider the extraordinary women of comedy.
Or, you know, there’s always choosing another Jimmy.

There have been many late night hosts of the female gender. None of them have shown that they can draw audiences better than the current hosts. Rest assured, that women will keep arriving on the scene as guest hosts and as soon as one of them is excellent, she will get a shot at her own show or take over an existing one.

As long as the movie looks exciting, the release date won’t impact its ability to pull incredible numbers. Such is the case with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which opened to a capital $95 million, is easily a new record for the month of April, over Fast Five ($86.2M in 2011). This also marks nearly a 48 percent improvement over the first Captain, showing not only the goodwill of the first film but also the Avengers boost.
Since the record-breaking run of The Avengers, subsequent films from Marvel Studios have each had a boost over their prior film. Iron Man 3 finished with an incredible $409M and Thor: The Dark World just finished its run with $206.3M.
It’s also helped that Disney and Marvel Studios are now more confident in differentiating their franchises: the Thor sequel was able to go further down the path of being a sci-fi fantasy and no more was that shown than with this release. Trailers did a great job of showing not only an action-packed adventure, but also one with elements of espionage, political thrills and globe-trotting missions.
The new characters introduced were also more exciting than the other post-Avengers films, ranging from the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the enigmatic Winter Soldier (no need for spoilers) and even the presence of Hollywood legend Robert Redford built a good bit of buzz. It’s practically the first true summer blockbuster of the year — although it bears mentioning the silliness of this being a summer film even though we’re only two weeks into spring.
If it follows the legs of Thor: The Dark World, it’s practically guaranteed a $230M+ finish. It has no direct competition until  in May and with a 89% Rotten Tomatoes rating, we could be looking at utter domination on the part of the patriotic Avenger. Not only that, but it’s done much better overseas, having already topped its predecessor’s overseas total. It’s not likely to match the other superhero films though: some markets still haven’t warmed up to the character because he’s so jingoistic — the man’s costume is literally the American flag.  Still a big improvement though.
Noah dropped to second place but it didn’t do so gracefully, falling 61.1 percent to $17M for a total of $72.34M. While it’ll likely finish matching its budget, and will likely have a great run overseas, the changes it made to the source material were too polarizing and the mixed word-of-mouth from audiences who weren’t expecting this approach is likely the culprit.
Summit Entertainment has to be happy with the legs Divergent has shown, at least in comparison to other young-adult adaptations. The sci-fi feature fell a relatively modest 49.3 percent to $13M for a total of $114M, surpassing its budget, which must make the producers happy about moving forward with the two sequels. It’s done hardly any business internationally however; the overseas market is very fickle when it comes to science fiction and it seems the film hasn’t yet caught fire.
God’s Not Dead continues to define the odds, having yet another light drop of 12.2 percent to $7.8M and a total of $32.6M. The Christian-geared film covered its budget in the first weekend so everything from this point is profit. And the film’s buzz likely won’t be going away too soon: Kevin Sorbo, the star of the film, is crowdsourcing a tele-production about Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the Philadelphia doctor who last year was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and a number of other atrocities in his back-alley abortion clinic. This will only boost the profile of Sorbo and will create subsequent buzz for God’s Not Dead among its core audience, as both pro-lifers and pro-choicers have used Dr. Gosnell for their own political points. However, it will face competition by another faith-based film, Heaven Is For Real, which comes out April 16.

A new study conducted by the USC Keck School of Medicine and published in the Journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology deduced that Caucasian pre-school boys are more likely to suffer from color blindness when compared with African American boys of the same age.
The study, which sampled 4,005 children, ages 3-6 in Los Angeles and Riverside county pre-schools found 5.6 percent of Caucasian boys, 3.1 percent of Asian boys, 2.6 percent of Hispanic boys and 1.4 percent of African-American boys are colorblind.
According to the National Institute of Health, the most common type of color blindness — red-green colorblindness — is a sex-linked recessive trait present on the X-chromosome. This accounts for colorblindness being more common in males who only have one X-chromosome as opposed to girls who have two X chromosomes.
According to the study, the rate of colorblindness in girls ranges from 0 percent to 0.5 percent for all ethnicities.
Lead researcher of the study, Dr. Rohit Varma, who is also chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology at Keck and director of the USC Eye Institute, said that the study could have further implication in the academic setting. Early diagnosis, he said, is key to making sure that children can thrive academically beginning at a young age.
“It’s not that the child is not smart enough or bright enough, it’s that they see the world a little differently,” Varma said in a press release.
Early diagnosis of color blindness is also an important factor in making sure that children can have access to any academic accommodations they might require.
“That needs to start early on because labeling a child as not smart or bright enough is a huge stigma for the child and causes significant anxiety for the parents and family,” Varma said in the release.

Just like that, the MLB season is already a week underway. We’ve already seen some amazing action, like Giancarlo Stanton’s 484 foot moon shot, Mike Trout’s contract-validating first at bat home run and the fact that Grady Sizemore is still healthy after four long, instant replay-filled games.
While the first week is incredibly entertaining for pure fans of the game, it is a headache for fantasy owners trying to decide whether they should drop their slow starting players for what they hope to be the next waiver wire superstar. Even though ESPN fantasy writers like to say that most owners are panicking over their struggling and warn them against doing so, I advocate the opposite approach. Panic on the fringe guys (save Billy Hamilton) and stay patient with the guys you shelled out a lot of money/high draft pick for.
All those who are in standard leagues or anywhere close to those settings have many, almost too many, good players on the free agent list because people don’t know them yet (looking at Erasmo Ramírez, Drew Hutchison and James Paxton). Therefore, it’s important to clear room on your team for these high upside guys to occupy your precious roster space rather than an overachieving Mark Buehrle. But aside from Ramírez, Hutchison and Paxton, which other quick starters are necessities to add to your soon-to-be championship squad before anyone else in your league gets smart and adds those players themselves and which will fade into obscurity after a couple weeks?
Hitters (Top 3 on ESPN’s Player Rater who are not 100% owned)
Charlie Blackmon, Colorado Rockies OF, (51% confidence level)

Of all the players on this list, Blackmon is by far the biggest enigma. His six for six performance is special ­– he’s only the 66th player since 1914 to accomplish that feat. With all those sixes, it’s just fate that he’s going to be successful. If you’re less of a believer in that kind of stuff, Blackmon did hit over .300 with Colorado in 250 at bats last year with a .467 slugging percentage. With Blackmon, everything rides on his plate discipline: last year he struck out 49 times to a lowly seven walks, while through one week, it’s still only one-to-one. If he can keep that low, he’ll be the surprise breakout of the year. But if he keeps his ratio like last year, he’ll be another forgotten man.
Emilio Bonifacio, Chicago Cubs, 2B/OF, (0%)
Is he Bona fide or Bonifacio? The people at ESPN started asking just that several years ago because Bonifacio has fooled the fantasy world before, but he shouldn’t again. He went a record setting 11/16 with four stolen bases out of the gate, and was all the rage the first week, but he 0/3 the next day, showing his true colors. While his age wouldn’t be a conversation-ender in terms of rapid improvement, the fact that he’s been in the league seven years (compared to a guy like Blackmon with only three, none of them anywhere close to full length) should kill any hopes of progression and should instead signal a hot streak.
Alejandro De Aza, Chicago White Sox, OF, (20%)
An unlikely home runs leader after the first real day of baseball, who added another one two days later for good measure, Alejandro De Aza seems like that José Bautista/Edwin Encarnacion/Chris Davis type power prospect who was missing something, put it together and then became a star, right? Wrong. This is a guy who typically steals 20-25 bases and would hit for modest power if he played a full season. But he doesn’t, not because he’s injury prone, but because his manager doesn’t view him as a full-time player. And you know what, neither do I. He hits right-handers decently well, but is platooned out for teammate Dayán Viciedo when a lefty is on the mound. While some guys make a decent career off that, de Aza isn’t someone who will be worth the trouble managing your lineup every day, trying to balance when he’ll be in or out and on top of that won’t even be that reliable when he is playing righties. Leave him on the waiver wire and move on.
Honorable mentions:
Ángel Pagán, San Francisco Giants OF (90% confidence) – Won’t be a Chris Davis, but will definitely fill out a roster, great or points leagues
Casey McGehee, Miami Marlins 1B (60%) – I think the guy got his groove back playing in the Korean leagues and playing behind a budding superstar in Giancarlo Stanton can’t hurt.
Dee Gordon, Los Angeles Dodgers, 2B/SS (75%) – I have my doubts, but they’re in the back of my mind with all my positive energy in the front. This guy will get on base, and he will steal even more.
Pitchers (Top 3 on ESPN’s Player Rater who are not 100% owned)
Mark Buehrle, Toronto Blue Jays SP (0% confidence level)
Buehrle is the guy known for pitching complete games comes within one out of going the distance. No surprise, he seems like he’s 50 now, so who cares how taxed his arm is. But the long-time White Sox pitcher threw an unBuehrle-like 11 ks in the process, prompting a 33.5% increase in owners across ESPN to add him. He’s not getting any younger. There’s zero room for improvement and in an interview he even said he’s not doing anything differently. He will never eclipse the number of strikeouts he threw in the first start of this season, you can quote me on that.
Tim Hudson, San Francisco Giants SP (5%)
See Mark Buehrle. It’s the same story, except Hudson just threw 7 strikeouts, which is eye-opening only because Hudson throws around three or four per game. So why 5 percent confidence when Buehrle has zero? Hudson just signed to the Giants, so go ahead and take a flier on the ballpark, new pitching coaches or some random factor revitalizing his career. Just don’t waste any money buying that flier. If a friend gets you a flier for your birthday, don’t make it awkward and return it. But it’s definitely useful if it’s free. Otherwise, let it go.
James Paxton, Seattle Mariners SP (33%)
A highly regarded prospect for a couple years now, Paxton was someone I had an eye on this year, but thought he was a year away from being a major impact pitcher on the mixed league scale. However, after his first start, he’s making the case that he matters now. He has all the stuff a pitcher needs to succeed in this league, but I still think it’s one of those cases where he surprises early and then after watching some tape, hitters will figure him out and he will fall out of relevancy. Still, if you would’ve asked me what my confidence in him before the season started, I would’ve said 5 percent, showing just how much this start improved my season outlook for the kid. Despite the relatively low confidence level, he’s a guy you must add to your team if my honorable mentions aren’t already taken.
Honorable Mentions:
Scott Kazmir, Oakland Athletics SP (100% confidence level) – I’m really not sure why this guy isn’t 100 percent owned. He had a very good bounce-back year last year after being out of baseball for a two-year term with a k/9 over 9 and now he plays in the most pitcher friendly ballpark.
Michael Pineda, New York Yankees SP (100%) – Elite rookie two years ago. Gets Tommy John. Gets traded. Becomes forgotten. Has a great spring throwing 90-91 MPH. Hits 95 consistently in his first start. This is a lock until he gets hit with an innings cap.
Erasmo Ramírez, Seattle Mariners SP (80%) – There was some stat that I read two years ago that made Ramirez a really deep sleeper pick in last year’s draft. He made a couple good starts and then was out for the year. Well he’s back, and had a stellar first start. Buy in.
