Two parents in the college admissions case have agreed to plead guilty for arranging for their daughter’s fraudulent acceptance to USC as a volleyball recruit.
Diane and Todd Blake enlisted the help of Operation Varsity Blues scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer to secure their daughter’s admission to USC in fall 2017. Senior associate athletic administrator Donna Heinel, Singer’s co-conspirator, created a recruitment profile for the Blakes’ daughter that listed several fabricated athletic honors and presented it to an admissions committee in September 2017, whereupon conditional acceptance was granted and the couple sent Singer and Heinel payments totaling $250,000.
The Blakes face charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud; conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery; and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Diane will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and honest services wire and mail fraud, while Todd will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and honest services wire and mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The government attorney prosecuting the case will drop the other charges as part of the plea deal.
The government has recommended a sentence of four months in prison, two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service for Todd, while Diane received a lighter recommended penalty of six weeks in prison, two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service. The prosecution has also recommended each of them be fined $125,000. The maximum penalty the court may impose upon Diane is a 20-year prison sentence with three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine, while Todd faces up to 40 years in prison, six years of supervised release and a fine of $750,000.
The Blakes are scheduled to enter their guilty pleas Tuesday in Boston federal court. They are among 19 parents in the admissions case connected to USC and will join the eight to date who have entered guilty pleas and proceeded to sentencing. The remaining nine parents with ties to the University have opted to contest charges and will stand trial beginning in October.

USC’s much-anticipated matchup with the Alabama Crimson Tide in Jerry World will have to wait. 
The Pac-12 Conference announced Friday that it will be adopting a delayed conference-only schedule for several fall sports in the 2020 season, including football, soccer and women’s volleyball. The move follows in the footsteps of the Big Ten Conference, which became the first of the Power Fives to abandon its original schedule and adopt the conference-only format for all fall sports Thursday.
The Pac-12 has also decided to delay the start of mandatory athletic activities — originally slated for Monday for teams that began their seasons Sept. 5 — to an unspecified date.
“Our decisions have and will be guided by science and data, and based upon the trends and indicators over the past days, it has become clear that we need to provide ourselves with maximum flexibility to schedule, and to delay any movement to the next phase of return-to-play activities,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement announcing the decision.
Details on the conference-only schedule will come before August, the Pac-12’s statement read. According to The Athletic, the Pac-12 has considered nine- and 10-game schedules for the conference-only football season.
According to the statement, student-athletes who choose to forgo competition in the upcoming academic year due to health concerns will not lose their scholarships. The Pac-12 did not specify whether an athlete will exhaust a year of eligibility should they choose to sit out the season. 
“Competitive sports are an integral part of the educational experience for our student-athletes, and we will do everything that we can to support them in achieving their dreams while at the same time ensuring that their health and safety is at the forefront,” Pac-12 CEO group chair and president of the University of Oregon Michael Schill said in the statement.
The news of the reconfigured schedule does not yet guarantee that there will be a 2020 college football season, but the Pac-12’s statement specified that it plans to hold seasons for all sports so long as it can meet student-athletes’ health and safety needs and receives the green light from health authorities.
As is typical, USC football originally had three nonconference games on its schedule this year — Week 1 against Alabama in Arlington, Texas, Week 2 against New Mexico at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Week 13 against Notre Dame at the Coliseum to round out the regular season. This will be the first time USC and Notre Dame do not face each other since World War II.
“We recognize how important both our historic series with Notre Dame and highly-anticipated contest with Alabama are to our student-athletes, fans and alumni,” Athletic Director Mike Bohn said in a statement posted to his Twitter Friday night.
The USC Athletic Department had not released schedules for any other fall sports prior to the announcement.
The Pac-12’s decision comes as coronavirus cases are on the uptick across the country — particularly in Arizona and California, which together host six of the conference’s 12 programs. The University of Arizona was forced to pause its student-athlete return-to-campus plan June 29 amid an influx of coronavirus infections in the state. According to ESPN, the increasing cases in Los Angeles and a worry that USC and UCLA would not be able to start on time factored into the delay. 
“In going to a conference-only schedule for fall sports in 2020 the Pac-12 Conference is acting responsibly on behalf of the health and safety of all of our student-athletes, coaches and staff, while trying to do everything possible so we can compete this year,” Bohn’s statement read.
USC began its phased student-athlete return plan June 24 and initiated phase two Wednesday to allow nonlocal continuing athletes to participate in voluntary workouts. To date, the Athletic Department has reported 126 total coronavirus tests taken among the returning athletes, two of which yielded a positive result.

The John Wayne exhibit in the School of Cinematic Arts will be removed as a result of the Black Lives Matter movement, SCA Assistant Dean of Diversity & Inclusion Evan Hughes announced Friday. Hughes said the school intends to remove it before the start of the fall semester, though the definite timeline is uncertain.
“Conversations about systemic racism in our cultural institutions along with the recent global, civil uprising by the Black Lives Matter Movement require that we consider the role our School can play as a change maker in promoting antiracist cultural values and experience,” Hughes wrote in an email to the SCA community.
The exhibit, which honors Wayne’s 152-film history with displays of costumes, personal items, film clips and photos, was installed June 2012.
In September, students, led by rising senior Eric Plant, protested for the removal of the exhibit, accusing the school of “endorsing white supremacy” by dedicating an exhibit to the racist actor. While the school said it would consider the removal, it ultimately decided in December to keep the Wayne exhibit but convert the space into one that discusses the “complex narrative” of the American West as told in cinema.
“In the events that have happened this summer, the protests and the Black Lives Matter movement, I just think that we’re in a different moment than we were even six months ago, and I think it’s important that SCA really take a stand and say that in order to reinforce our anti-racist agenda, we need to take certain steps to kind of ensure that we’re modeling the best behavior, and so that’s why we changed the decision to do that,” Hughes told the Daily Trojan. 
Controversy regarding Wayne came up after a1971 Playboy magazine interview revealed his support of white supremacy and anti-Black racism. 
“I believe in white supremacy,” Wayne said. “We can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks.”
The exhibit materials will be housed in the school’s archives. While they may not be accessible to the public, they will remain usable for future reference and research, according to the statement. 
“Placing them within the proper archival and research context will allow scholarship to continue on the rule that John Wayne’s films played in the history of cinema,” Hughes wrote. 
The decision also follows President Carol Folt’s June announcement of the removal of former USC president and known eugenicist  Rufus von KleinSmid from The Center for International and Public Affairs.
