USC President C. L. Max Nikias released a statement Friday in response to the selection of journalist Christiane Amanpour as USC’s 2012 commencement speaker.
The Daily Trojan reported USC’s selection Saturday. She will be the third woman since 1983 to address USC’s graduating class.

Nikias said USC is honored to host Amanpour.
“Her global perspective on the issues that affect our nation and the world add a valuable element to our national dialogue, and as her many awards testify, Amanpour represents the best in journalistic achievement,” Nikias said.
Amanpour’s accolades include an inaugural Television Academy Award, nine News and Documentary Emmys and four George Foster Peabody Awards.
Amanpour, who serves as the chief international correspondent for CNN International and the global affairs anchor for ABC News, said she is excited to address USC’s graduating class.
“It’s always so exciting to look into the eyes of the next generation of leaders, and from my perspective to exhort them to travel and learn as much about the world as possible,” Amanpour said in an email. “Today, just staying onshore is not an option.”

I’m kind of disgusted that according to your guys’ poll, over 1/4 of people on this site don’t know who she is. Maybe we should have invited Kim Kardashian or something.

Former USC quarterback Mitch Mustain signed a minor league contract to play baseball for the Chicago White Sox, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Mustain has not played baseball competitively in eight years, but he sparked the interest of the White Sox after throwing a ball 90 mph.
“This is my one shot and I have nothing to lose,” Mustain told the LA Times in a phone interview.
In 2007, Mustain transferred from the University of Arkansas in hopes that he could parlay his time in Los Angeles into a career in professional football. Yet, the transfer only started one game during his career playing for the Trojans, battling former quarterback Mark Sanchez and junior quarterback Matt Barkley for field time.
Since graduating from USC, Mustain has experienced turbulent times. In addition to a brief stint in the Canadian Football League, Mustain was arrested in 2011 on suspicion of selling Adderall, but was never charged, according to the LA Times.

Fifteen campaign signs for Jared Ginsburg and Sam Coxe, candidates for Undergraduate Student Government President and Vice President, were taken down from Trousdale Parkway last night without permission from USG or the candidates, USG confirmed.
“The take down was not authorized by [USG],” said Elise Fabbro, USG director of elections and recruitment.
Ginsburg said he suspects that foul play was involved.
“There is suspicion, on our part, that there is involvement, not by other candidates, [necessarily], but by their supporters,” Ginsburg said. “It is particularly obvious to people who have been following [the election] closely that one of the tickets may have been involved in this serious violation.”
Ginsburg and Coxe are investigating the sign removals by filing a report with the Dept. of Public Safety.
“We are looking into the availability of video footage,” Ginsburg said.
Ginsburg said his campaign’s top priority is finding a way to acquire replacement signs. The ticket was unable to order additional signs at the start of the campaign because of USG’s strict budget rules.
“Sam and I are frantically trying to get replacements by Monday, but there is no guarantee given the exorbitant price of overnight shipping,” Ginsburg said.
The candidates can file an election complaint if they find evidence of tampering, Fabbro said.
If a complaint is filed, an election commission comprising five students would have 24 hours to review the case and decide whether to proceed or dismiss the case. If they chose to hear the case, the commission would have 24 hours to make a ruling. A video of the commission meeting would be released the next day.
“We have considered it, but want to gather more evidence,” said Ginsburg, who also said the setback will not affect their campaign’s energy. “This will in no way stop our passion and commitment in wining this campaign, because our platform is in the best interest of the undergraduate student body.”

After missing the ITA National Team Indoor Championship last year, the Women of Troy have made their way back to Charlottesville, Va., riding a five-game winning streak to start the year.
Ranked No. 16 in the country, USC just made the cut for the Indoor Championships, which only allows the top 16 teams in the nation to compete.
The Women of Troy are looking at this tournament as a great learning experience, but they also are coming to Virginia ready to prove themselves among the nation’s best. USC has not reached a semifinal match in the National Indoor Championship since 2003, and before then it had been 15 years since their previous appearance.
Armed with a slew of freshman, most notably No. 18 Sabrina Santamaria and No. 19 Zoë Scandalis, the Women of Troy should not be overlooked because of their inexperience, and coach Richard Gallien views his youth movement as a positive heading into the weekend.
“While we might be a young squad, I view it as a good thing,” Gallien said. “Even though we may not have the experience [of] other teams, our girls are very excited to go out there and play, which is extremely important to us.”
In their first round match, which starts on Friday at 3:15 EST, the Women of Troy square off against No. 8 North Carolina Tar Heels.
Coming off of a tough defeat against No. 12 Northwestern, the Tar Heels (5-2) are looking for revenge against USC. Lead by No. 16 Lauren McHale, who lost the decisive match to the Wildcats’ Kate Turvy last weekend, North Carolina is playing a de facto home game, especially compared to the West Coast-based Women of Troy.
The Tar Heels boast a quality doubles team in junior McHale and senior Shinann Featherston, who received ITA All-American honors and ended up ranked No. 7 in the country last season. On top of that duo, North Carolina also has a talented freshman of their own in Georgia native Caroline Price. Despite her youth, the 5-11 lefty is currently ranked No. 55 in the nation and is coming off of a solid win in third singles against Northwestern.
The way it looks to shake out this weekend would put Santamaria up against the fellow freshman Price in the third singles with junior Danielle Lao matching up against the also experienced Featherston. In first singles, McHale is set to face off against Zoë Scandalis, who will once again take on a top opponent this season
Despite being possibly the fourth singles this weekend, sophomore Kaitlyn Christian was recognized as Pac-12 Player of the Week after not losing a set this past weekend. Christian is just one example of the great depth that the Women of Troy possess throughout their lineup.
If the Women of Troy do dispatch of the Tar Heels, which will be no easy feat, their competition includes 14 of the top 16 teams in the country, with only No. 1 Florida and No. 2 Stanford not competing this weekend. Despite their absences, the tournament still boasts perennial powers like Duke, Georgia and Baylor, along with Pac-12 rivals UCLA and Cal as well.
While winning will always be the ultimate goal, the Women of Troy will be provided a great experience against quality competition going forward.

With a strong performance to begin the season at the New Balance Collegiate Invitational in New York, the men’s and women’s track and field teams continue to prepare for the upcoming Texas A&M Challenge, which will take place Saturday.
The teams are seeking to prove themselves against the toughest indoor track competitors nationwide. USC has traditionally proven successful in the outdoor season; the men have won 26 NCAA championships while the women won their first championship in 2001.
But contrary to the outdoor team’s dominance, track and field has held relatively little influence indoors, claiming only two NCAA titles. Despite this apparent lack of success in the spring, the program is continuing to grow indoors.
During their competition in New York, the teams faced stiff competition from colleges with traditionally stronger programs, including the University of Oregon and the University of Florida. The team came out of the meet with a single win, with junior Alitta Boyd jumping 20’9-3/4″ to win women’s long jump.
Despite the lack of individual wins, the women’s team managed to finish 18th overall, thanks to the efforts of sophomore Jessica Davis and senior Dalilah Muhammad. Davis placed sixth in the 200 m dash finals, while Muhammad — competing at her last New Balance Invitational — finished eighth in the 60-meter hurdle.
This growth is attributable to longtime USC Track & Field Director Ron Allice, who has been building both programs for more than 16 years. Allice, who has led the program to enormous success: 10 men’s individual titles and USC’s only women’s team title in 2001. Allice continues to build the foundation for a storied chapter of USC athletics that has dominated collegiate track and field, seeking to add yet another set of plaques to the National and Olympic Monuments in Loker Stadium.

When Taylor Swift first entered the music scene in 2006 with her elementary lyrics and schoolgirl charm, it was difficult to imagine that she’d have the staying power to make a significant impact on the country world. Then she nabbed four Grammys, 10 American Music Awards and several minor roles in film in television. For 2012, it appears that Swift will uphold that technique of keeping us on our toes.
The past few months have already been busy for Swift. She’s landed a performance at the 54th Grammy Awards, airing Sunday on CBS, and nominations for three Country Music Awards. She just finished work on her movie The Lorax, set for release March 2. Her chic, new look warranted a feature story in the February issue of Vogue. It’s clear that Swift is keen to explore multiple arenas.
“I fret about the future,” Swift said in her interview with Vogue. “What my next move should be. What the move after that should be. How I am going to sustain this. How do I evolve.”
Considering how she seems to dabble in everything, Swift’s career remains somewhat of a puzzle. Musical geeks will recall how she recently turned down a lead role in the movie version of Les Misérables. Though it appeared that Swift wasn’t the crowd favorite for the character of Eponine –Lea Michele and Evan Rachel Wood were among the more vocally-talented choices–her motivations for rejecting the role are questionable. The part ultimately went to theater veteran Samantha Barks, which left questions as to Swift’s motivations for leaving behind such a desirable role.
Many Swift and Les Mis fans were hoping that Swift’s Vogue interview would shed some light on her decision, but her responses remained faintly vague.
“Lately I’ve been focusing on trying to be here,” said Swift. “Trying to be who I am, where I am, at the moment. But, you know, I am having a big meeting with my team next week, planning 2013. Which makes it hard!”
Still, despite the questionable situation behind Les Misérables, Swift continues to advance her career. Her latest endeavor involves blending the cinema world with that of the musical: adding her own element to the soundtrack of The Hunger Games. Her recent single, “Safe and Sound,” is set to premiere on MTV February 13 at 7:54 pm. The video supposedly revolves around the civil war component of The Hunger Games’ plot, and, after the premier, Swift is scheduled to discuss her work in a 30-mintute interview on MTV’s website.
