There exists an ongoing and seemingly endless verbal war between bookworms and film geeks since the first instance that The Dreaded Question was uttered. Historians remain unsure as to whether the question spilt first from the lips of a literature aficionado or a cinematic connoisseur; however, they agree that an unknown individual turned to his movie-going partner as the credits rolled across the screen and inquired, “Do you think the movie was better than the book?”
Now, decades after this monumental event occurred, lit lovers and movie nerds can once again suit up in their armor of argument as yet another adaptation of a novel hits the silver screen.

Based on Nobel Laureate J.M. Coetzee’s award-winning book of the same name, Disgrace stars seasoned film and theater actor John Malkovich as David Lurie, a divorced husband, father and professor of romantic literature at a university in post-apartheid South Africa.
A self-proclaimed ladies man, Lurie engages in numerous affairs with women to satisfy his unbridled sexual cravings. “‘Sooner murder an infant in its cradle then nurse unacted desires,’” Lurie quotes midway through the film.
However, when he is accused of raping one of his students — who is of mixed race — Lurie abandons his position at the university and lives in exile with his daughter, Lucy (newcomer Jessica Haines, in a promising debut) at her farm in the countryside. Their somewhat peaceful existence is brutally interrupted by a vicious attack on their farm by three young black men.
After discovering that his daughter was raped during the attack, Lurie is forced to reconsider his responsibilities as a father and as a citizen in a multiracial community.
The South African-born Coetzee tackled the ambitious subject material of sexual desire and interracial relations in a hefty 224 pages, prompting it to be ranked No. 1 in “The greatest novel of the last 25 years” list by The Observer in 2006. On the other hand, director Steve Jacobs and his wife, screenwriter Anna-Maria Monticelli, have only 120 minutes to cut the meaty novel into a similarly powerful and effective movie. What they have produced is a film ripe with equal amounts of dialogue and brooding silence, but sorely lacking in any type of cinematic or visual identity.
It is undeniable that Jacobs, a former AFI Best Actor award winner, knows how to direct a scene of dialogue. One particular scene involving Lurie’s repentance to the father of the devastated student stands as one of the most powerful and poignant moments in the film. However, it appears that the director has sacrificed the use of cinematography to heighten the drama by placing his camera in the least obtrusive position from his actors.
Ultimately, it is left to Malkovich and his impressive acting chops to rescue the film. The beloved actor, famous for his instantly recognizable and strangely entrancing monotonous voice, certainly gives a compelling performance. He bravely undertakes the difficult task of establishing the viewer’s sympathy for Lurie, a dynamic character with a “mad heart” whose vile actions should be condemned. Yet Malkovich’s best work has come, arguably, under the direction of visionary filmmakers with distinct styles, such as Spike Jonze’s Being John Malkovich, Steven Spielberg’s Empire of the Sun and Wolfgang Petersen’s In the Line of Fire. The audience is left wondering whether the stage and its heavily performance-based attributes would have been a far more effective medium for the adaptation of the novel.
Above all of the film’s faults, it is the impossibly daunting subject matter that inevitably dooms Disgrace. Just as the audience becomes invested in Lurie’s plight and expects the film to deconstruct the idea of man as a sexual being, the film promptly switches to Lucy’s farm and the weighty topic of interracial relations.
Jacobs and Monticelli simply have brought too much to the table for the audience to digest. What is most unfortunate is that the viewer is forced to return to the original work after watching Disgrace, not out of a peaked interest but out of the necessity to get the experience that Coetzee intended for his novel.
Perhaps, the argument between book lovers and movie fanatics is founded on the wrong question. Whether the movie manages to stand alone from its original material provides much more intriguing fodder for debate.
Excellent article. And, well written. Thank you AJ. I look forward to reading more of your film reviews.

If the USC women’s soccer team makes a deep run in the playoffs, it will probably look back at this weekend as the defining moment of its season.
The Women of Troy (7-3) went on the road and beat No. 9 Santa Clara 2-0 on Sunday and came from two goals down to beat Pacific 3-2 on Friday. After starting the season 1-3, USC has now won six straight games, including two against ranked opponents.

“The ladies are starting to believe they are a good team,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We talked about earning respect because this is a new situation that we find ourselves in as Trojans. And I thought they did a good job of coming out and earning respect.”
Santa Clara (8-3) came straight at the USC defense with 20 shots, but was turned away time and again by senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen. Olsen recorded eight saves for her 23rd shutout of her career.
“Kristen Olsen is just Kristen Olsen. She’s becoming a better organizer in the back and she’s realizing that’s making her life easier,” Khosroshahin said.
Olsen anchors a very young backline for USC, which has been decimated by injuries. But after playing together for a few games, the defense has finally found some chemistry and stayed strong against the Broncos.
“We did a good job keeping them in front of us,” sophomore defender Chelsea Buehning said. “They had three players up top and they were moving a lot but we didn’t let them get behind us and we kept ourselves out of dangerous situations.”
Buehning also got into the attack, as she scored USC’s first goal of the game in the 50th minute. After the Broncos cleared a ball out of the box, Buehning gathered it along the left sideline and fired the ball towards the back post, hoping someone would be able to get a head on it. But the result was better than she expected, as it sailed into the upper right-hand corner for her first career goal.
The Women of Troy then held their own as the Broncos came at them with a barrage of shots. But some tough goalkeeping by Olsen kept the Broncos out of the back of the net.
“She was awesome and had my back so many times,” Buehning said. “I’m so confident in her back there.”
A goal on the counterattack in the 90th minute by junior midfielder Alyssa Davila, her fourth goal of the year, ensured the Women of Troy would leave Santa Clara as winners — something No. 5 Notre Dame couldn’t do two weeks ago.

For the USC Women’s Cross Country team, Saturday’s Stanford Invitational marked the most important meet of the season thus far. However, the Women of Troy did not quite perform up to the moment.
USC finished 11th in a field of 22 in the 6K race, below the team’s and coach Tom Walsh’s expectations.

“Overall I don’t think it was our best effort,” Walsh admitted. “We just didn’t have a good day. We’re not racing up to the way we’re training.”
The race took place in the middle of a scorching 90-degree day in Palo Alto, making personal-bests hard to come by. Walsh made no excuses, however.
“It wasn’t just hot for [us],” Walsh said. “It was 90 degrees for everybody. We just need to do a better job in the middle of the race [by] being tougher mentally and we’ll be fine.”
One of the positives that emerged from Saturday’s race was the return of junior Zsofia Erdelyi, who missed USC’s first two races with a foot injury. Erdelyi, who qualified for the NCAA Championships last season, picked up where she left off in 2008 by finishing 13th overall despite not racing at 100 percent.
“She still wasn’t happy because she doesn’t like getting beat by runners who she knows she’s better than,” Walsh said of Erdelyi.
The coach also said he was proud of the effort Erdelyi gave despite her injury problems.
“Sometimes when runners aren’t in great shape, they don’t give 100 percent effort because they know they’re not going to have a great result,” Walsh said. “I was very happy that she didn’t give up.”
Other than Erdelyi, however, the rest of the Women of Troy did not match up with the vastly improved competition present at the Stanford Invite. The No. 5 Stanford Cardinal scored a meet-best 24 points, followed by Cal (100 points) and Loyola Marymount (143). Seven other schools followed before USC, which finished with 332 points.
“[The race] was definitely a test to see where we were at,” Walsh said. “We need to get more experienced. That experience sometimes kicks in during the middle of the season, but it would be great for us if it comes at the end, because that’s when we need it the most.”
Rounding out the rest of USC’s top five runners were Mt. San Antonio transfer Christine Cortez, senior captain Bridget Helgerson, and fellow freshmen Kathleen Moloney and Kelly Owen. Walsh also found a silver lining in the performances of his first-year runners.
“I think the freshman are making progress,” Walsh said. “They’re improving and getting better each week. They’ll definitely help us at the end of this season and certainly in future seasons.”
Although the rest of USC’s performance was not outstanding, Walsh is not concerned with how the team races in September.
“We’re not where we want to be yet, but our goal is to peak at the end of the season,” he said of his team. “As a coach, I’m trying to make sure they run their best races at Pac-10 [meets] and regional’s. We still have five or six weeks to go. We have work to do.”

Did you know you should be waking up earlier? According to COEDmagazine.com, there are actually no more and no less than eight reasons why you should be irritating your roommates before ten o’clock. And you know it’s true because this is the same website reminding us with a feature story on “fripples” (frozen nipples). And if it’s correct about September being the start of “nipple season,” than it must be correct about this!
Let’s take look at some of the reasons:
Reason #1: The morning is a time for “growing yourself – professionally, emotionally, phisically, mentally and spiritually.” Because if we’re not reading “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Soul” in the morning, you might as well not be reading it at all.
Reason #5: Use morning time for thinking. Because humans don’t think past 10 a.m., natch.
Reason #6: Humans should wake up when the sun wakes up— it’s nature! But this means that we get to go back to sleep every time there’s a cloud. Also, bed time is 7:30 p.m.
Reason #7: Meditate. You know, to “relax your brain and sharpen your mind.” Oh wait, you know what also does that? Sleep.
Curiously, none of the reasons are getting a massage from a hot girl, which is the image displayed next to the story.
Fortunately, there is at also one reason to not wake up early: Because you will have to do that every day of your life after you graduate. Why start now?

After its 11-match win streak was snapped Friday night, the No. 13 USC women’s volleyball team bounced back Saturday to defeat Arizona State behind sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter’s career day.
Jupiter bounced back from a disappointing match on Friday to lead the charge for USC (12-2, 1-1 Pac-10) as she tallied career highs of 31 kills and 20 digs against the Sun Devils (11-3, 1-1) to give the Women of Troy their first win in the Pac-10 conference with a 3-1 victory (25-22, 21-25, 25-21, 25-22).
Bouncing back · Sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter rebounded from a subpar outing Friday with a career performance the following night. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
Senior All-American outside hitter Jessica Gysin, who didn’t play last week due to a hamstring injury, chipped in with season highs of 19 kills and 19 digs, and sophomore setter Kendall Bateman led the team with a career-high 60 assists. Gysin also had a season-high 19 kills and 19 digs. Senior libero Alli Hillgren had a season-high 24 digs.
“I thought the combination of Alex stepping up with Jess and Kendall’s performance delivering the ball was exceptional,” coach Mick Haley said.
USC hit .271 in the match, compared to Arizona State’s .193. Junior outside hitter Sarah Reaves led the Sun Devils with 20 kills and 10 digs.
Despite the victory, Haley expected more out of his team. The defensive troubles that hurt USC Friday night against Arizona surfaced once again against Arizona State, and the team had to rely on its offense for the win.
“We were fortunate to come out with 1-1 on the road,” Haley said. “I’m just really disappointed that we can’t get the defensive performance up to level. We have to be patient and keep working on it.”
USC opened conference play in disappointing fashion Friday night in Tucson against the No. 19 Wildcats, losing 3-1 (25-21, 25-23, 22-25, 25-21) behind a series of mistakes on the court.
The Women of Troy combined for 25 errors, led by Jupiter’s nine hitting errors and three service errors.
“We gave too many points away had a good chance to win that match and didn’t take advantage of it,” Haley said. “When you give a team nine or 10 points a game, you have a serious chance of getting beat.”
Gysin posted a solid match, leading the Women of Troy with 13 kills and eight digs. Junior outside hitter Kimmee Roleder, who returned to play after battling the flu last week, added 12 kills while sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams posted 11 kills. Jupiter recorded 12 kills, but hit .086 in the match.
Junior outside hitter Tiffany Owens racked up 16 kills and 13 digs while senior middle blocker Jacy Norton had 11 kills for the Wildcats and hit .500. Arizona improved to a perfect 12-0 on the season.
Arizona outblocked USC by a 9-3 margin as the Women of Troy committed 10 service errors against only two aces. USC hit .223 to Arizona’s .255.
USC returns home next weekend to host UC Berkeley and Stanford at the Galen Center.

Despite entering the weekend under unfamiliar circumstances, the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team ended its weekend doubleheader with a much more familiar result.
The Trojans defeated Pepperdine 14-8 in the first match of the day, pleasing a packed crowd in their home debut at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. Despite having had their 36-game winning streak snapped last weekend against UCLA, this victory was the Trojans’ 34th consecutive win at home.
Home cooking · Senior driver Matt Sagehorn’s two goals helped the Trojans win their 34th consecutive match at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. - Manat Saini | Daily Trojan
“It’s always fun to come back home and beat an opponent, especially Pepperdine,” said senior two-meter Shea Buckner. “It felt good to play at home. The atmosphere was good, and the crowd was fun.”
USC also beat Long Beach City College 15-6 in a scrimmage following the first match, with the Trojans using reserve players to earn the victory.
The Trojans commanded play for the majority of the Pepperdine contest, relying on their unrelenting offensive attacks to seal the victory. Senior driver Justin Rappel and redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling scored three goals each, while senior driver Matt Sagehorn and senior two-meter J.W. Krumpholz added two more each. USC managed to spread out its goals equally, scoring seven goals in each half between eight different players.
“We played well today,” Rappel said. “[We] made a couple mistakes, but overall it was a good game. [We] came out focused and ready to play.”
USC jumped out to an early lead on a goal from Krumpholz in the Trojans’ first 6-on-5 of the game, and then Sagehorn and Sterling each found the back of the net to go up 3-0. Pepperdine responded with a strike from Taylor Watson, but goals from sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka and Krumpholz put the Trojans up 5-1 after the first period.
Pepperdine responded in the second period with two fast goals, but USC was able to keep its advantage behind scores from Sterling and Buckner, and went into the half with a comfortable four-goal advantage.
The third period featured a flurry of offensive action, as the Trojans posted five goals and the Waves scored four. Rappel found the net three times in the frame, and Sagehorn and fellow senior driver Anthony Artukovich each added one more to silence a Waves’ attack that was threatening a comeback.
Two additional scores from Sagehorn and Sterling in the fourth period capped the 14-8 final for the Trojans.
Sophomore goalkeeper Joel Dennerley recorded eight saves in the match, but the Trojans’ defense was shaky at times against a strong Waves team that scored 75 goals in their first eight games. Pepperdine center Clayton Snyder had three goals, and was able to score on two occasions as part of the Waves’ four-goal third period, forcing the Trojans to make some defensive adjustments in the second half.
“It comes down to defense,” Rappel said. “We’re not really worried about scoring goals. If we play defense, the goals are going to come.”

It was never close, but it may not have been enough to satiate everyone’s appetite.
USC players filtered onto the field and into the tunnel with a business-like approach following their Saturday night victory. The stated mission of walking away with a win had been fulfilled, but plenty of opportunities had been left on the field.
A week after being upset by Washington, the Trojans bounced back with little resistance. The return of Matt Barkley revitalized USC’s offense and helped the Trojans coast to a 27-6 win against Washington State at the Coliseum.
Yet there was still a sense among USC coaches and players that the Trojans, who entered the game as 45.5-point favorites, could have made the game even easier.
Welcome return · Freshman Matt Barkley did not disappoint in his return to the starting lineup Saturday, finishing with 247 yards and two long touchdown passes to receivers Damian Williams and Brice Butler. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“The way I look at this game, we have a lot of work to do,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “It was not at all the satisfying win that we would have liked to have had.”
In his first game back from a bruised right shoulder, Barkley showed few lingering effects of the injury by throwing for 136 yards in the first quarter. Despite still feeling some pain when going through his throwing motion, the true freshman heaved the ball downfield early and often, finishing with 247 yards on 13-of-22 passing with two touchdowns.
“When I had to gun it, I did,” Barkley said. “It hurt a little, but that’s football.”
After the Trojans finished with 110 yards passing last week against the Huskies, the team’s emphasis on attacking downfield was palpable.
“We knew we could stretch them vertically,” Barkley said. “I think we hit what we could when it was there.”
Barkley connected with redshirt freshman wide receiver Brice Butler in the corner of the end zone for his first touchdown. After junior kicker Jacob Harfman recovered the ensuing onside kick, Barkley threw a dart over the middle to redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams, who dashed into the end zone untouched for a 57-yard score.
USC’s rushing attack supplemented the passing game with several long runs to start the game. The Trojans needed only 13 carries in the first half to rack up 113 yards.
The offensive momentum established by the Trojans in the early going was thrown off by a season-high 13 penalties for 115 yards. Although Carroll said he took issue with a number of the flagged plays, he admitted that he was not content with the self-imposed mistakes.
“We had so many situations where we made it hard on ourselves,” Carroll said. “We need to keep working on it.”
USC’s defense held its ground for the majority of the four quarters. Redshirt freshman defensive end Nick Perry and redshirt junior linebacker Michael Morgan combined for 4.5 sacks for a defensive unit that applied constant pressure to the opposing quarterbacks.
A week after earning their first win of the season by taking down Southern Methodist, the Cougars’ lone reason for optimism was their ability to stay in the game with a revamped defense.
Redshirt sophomore Marshall Lobbestael started the game at quarterback but was spelled midway through the second quarter by freshman Jeff Tuel. The two signal-callers only could muster 144 passing yards during the night, with a bulk of the production coming in the fourth quarter against USC’s second-string defense.
The Cougars controlled the second quarter with a 19-play drive that ate up more than eight and a half minutes. But despite controlling the ball and going 58 yards downfield, Washington State saw its 34-yard field goal attempt miss wide left as the first half expired.
Late in the fourth quarter, however, the Cougars turned a short field created by a redshirt quarterback Aaron Corp turnover into a touchdown, ending USC’s shutout hopes.
The match was a far cry from the Trojans’ 69-0 drubbing of the Cougars last year in Pullman, Wash. With Saturday’s trip to Cal looming, many Trojans insisted that the team has yet to show its best effort.
“We know what we’re capable of, and I think we showed that tonight,” Barkley said. “But I also think we’re capable of more.”

A week after getting upended in Seattle, the Trojans were supposed to return to the Coliseum and take their frustration out on Washington State like a drunken stepfather.
This one was supposed to be ugly. The 45.5-point spread was more of a generous suggestion for the Trojan offense, which ripped the lowly Cougars for 69 points last season.
When it was all said and done Saturday night, it most definitely was ugly, but not quite in the way USC had hoped.
After jumping out to a 20-0 first-quarter lead, the Trojan offense stalled, the penalty yards started piling up and the final 27-6 score was way too close for a Washington State team that needed overtime to defeat Southern Methodist last week.
Lingering issues · After USC failed to clean up its penalties and fumbling, Pete Carroll said his team still has plenty of work to do. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
So what does it mean? Plainly and simply, this USC team has a lot of problems to work out. For all its five-star talent and lopsided depth, there is great cause for concern for USC going forward.
“The way I look at this game, it’s great to win, it’s fun to win at the Coliseum, but we’ve got a lot of work to do,” coach Pete Carroll said. “It just was not at all the kind of satisfying win we’d like to have.”
And it wasn’t just a few bad breaks here and there. After the first quarter, the Trojans lost their rhythm and their focus across the board, putting up two goose eggs offensively in the second and third quarter before finally finding the end zone one last time in the fourth quarter.
The most glaring dilemma taken from the win was that the Trojans did not learn from the mistakes that cost them an undefeated season last week. Their performance in the penalty department only got worse — they racked up 115 yards on 13 yellow flags, almost all of which killed drives and eliminated momentum.
It was not the kind of outing USC fans expected, nor the kind the players expected from themselves.
“We had 13 penalties overall, so I think when we have those numbers we can always be playing better,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said. “We’re gonna look back at the tape tomorrow … and see what can get corrected, but I do believe we can play better than we did tonight.”
As Carroll put it, “It’s not stuff that’s indicative of playing good football.”
Granted, some of the penalties USC was flagged for were awful calls, particularly a holding call on redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams that negated part of a long junior Joe McKnight run.
“I’ll challenge half of those calls,” Carroll said of the penalties called on his team, adding, “I thought Damian’s block downfield on Joe’s big run was a fantastic block. ”
Carroll still recognized the magnitude of the penalty problem, but not exactly with urgency.
“We need to start practicing now and clean some things up,” he said. “We certainly can give a game away playing like that, so that’s the part we have to get rid of.”
Another aspect the Trojans failed to improve much upon was third-down conversions. After failing to convert a single third-down last week, the Trojans mustered only three in nine tries Saturday, and this against one of the worst passing defenses in the country.
“We have to get right and we’ve got to keep working at it,” Carroll said. “There’s just a lot of room for improvement.”
Red zone scoring was also a problem. The Trojans were stopped twice on fourth down inside Washington State’s 2-yard line, failing to put any points on the board and allowing the Cougars to hang around.
Then there were the fumbles. USC put the ball on the ground three times, losing two of them — one by Williams after a reception and the other by redshirt sophomore quarterback Aaron Corp while on backup duties.
These are problems the Trojans vowed to fix. These are issues they promised never to repeat. But after one week, the jury is still out on how capable this USC team is of cleaning up its mishaps.
After the game, the talk was already turning to next week, when the Trojans travel to Berkeley to face Cal in game that has lost a bit of its value after the Golden Bears suffered a 42-3 beating from Oregon Saturday. No matter how bad Cal looked against the Ducks, USC must fix the mistakes they have failed to correct in the last two weeks or it will be Washington all over again.
On that note, a reporter asked redshirt junior linebacker Michael Morgan what he thought of Cal’s loss to Oregon.
“Don’t take anything lightly I guess — play everybody,” Morgan said.
Meanwhile, Barkley, who was sitting next to Morgan at the press conference, muttered under his breath, “We already learned that one.”
After the Trojans’ lackluster display Saturday against the Cougars, I’m not sure they have.

After four top-10 teams lost this weekend, USC moved up to No. 7 in the AP rankings released Sunday.
A week ago, the Trojans’ national title hopes looked dim after a 16-13 upset loss to unranked Washington bounced them from No. 3 to No. 12. But it only took one week for the Trojans to get voted back into the top 10 and, in effect, back into title contention.
Florida remains atop the national polls, followed by No. 2 Texas, No. 3 Alabama, No. 4 LSU, No. 5 Boise State and No. 6 Virginia Tech. Oklahoma, Ohio State and Cincinnati round out the top 10.
The Trojans will play two more teams this season currently ranked in the Top 25. USC travels to No. 24 Cal next week and to No. 16 Oregon on Halloween.

It seems that navigating news on the Internet is harder than ever. Blogs, aggregators and Tweets complement the slew of traditional sources, but the choice can breed confusion. To help our own readers steer through the clamor, and to better serve an audience whose online habits have shifted dramatically in recent years, the Daily Trojan is launching a new website this week.
The new dailytrojan.com, which, for the first time, is wholly owned and controlled by the Daily Trojan’s staff and has a host of features that were missing from our old website. Four different blogs will keep readers updated throughout the day with news, quotes, photos and humor. Video packages embedded in stories will be commonplace, as will photo slideshows, podcasts and streaming video of campus events. The site’s presentation has also been overhauled — a new carousel presents stories at the top of the page, and it’s now easier to find articles from different sections and to check the “most emailed” list.
Look too, in the coming weeks and months, for aggregated news in partnership with newspapers at other Pac-10 schools and with other mediums on campus, like ATVN and Neon Tommy, an online news site run through the Annenberg School for Communication.
We hope these features will effectively aid our readers, but we recognize that the Internet’s landscape is shifting rapidly. Our site’s most important asset, then, is customization, and that’s why we have hired a webmaster whose sole responsibility will be maintaining and updating our site for content and usability. Ryan Furlong welcomes comments from readers on how we can make the new dailytrojan.com more relevant for today’s online news consumer. He can be reached at webmaster@dailytrojan.com.
We know the Daily Trojan may not be your first source of news, and our website won’t try to be your homepage. What we can do is provide professional, high-quality coverage of the areas where our strengths and our readers’ interests intersect: the USC administration and the students, faculty and staff who live, work and study here; the remarkable changes we’re seeing around campus and in the Figueroa Corridor; cultural events here and around Los Angeles; the USC athletes and coaches who can’t seem to escape the national spotlight; and the domestic and international issues affecting the USC community. We hope the new dailytrojan.com will make our coverage more accessible and provide a better service to our readers.
Finally!  A daily email / newspaper summary I can read! My son is a Junior at USC and I’ve been an email subscriber to the paper since 2007.  While the emails were bearable in the first year, they have been utterly atrocious since the change over to the commercial provider.  I’m glad to see they’re finally re-vamped and readable.  Thank you!

The story: USC easily handled Washington State, 27-6, but disappointments were abundant.
USC began the game in dramatic fashion, forcing the Cougars into an immediate three-and-out and scoring in just three plays on the offensive end.
The long ball · Junior receiver Damian Williams caught a 57-yard touchdown pass from Matt Barkley in the first quarter. The Trojan offense was firing on all cylinders early, but it could not maintain its hot start. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
But the No. 12 Trojans (3-1) committed 13 penalties, lost two fumbles and converted on only three of nine third-down plays.
And after the Trojans scored twice more to make it a 20-point first quarter, they couldn’t get on the board again until the fourth.
They held Washington State (1-3) scoreless for more than 59 minutes of the game, but the Cougars finally made it into the end zone on a two-yard run by senior running back Dwight Tardy with 22 ticks remaining.
Said senior safety Taylor Mays post-game: “It sucks that they scored at the end.”
Key play: With USC up 13-0 late in the first quarter, junior kicker Jacob Harfman placed a surprise onside kick in perfect position. Harfman recovered his own kick and USC went on to score on the next play with a 57-yard strike from Barkley to redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams. That made the score 20-0, which held until the fourth.
“[The onside kick] was in the game plan this week,” junior center Kristofer O’Dowd said of the play that electrified the Coliseum crowd. “I didn’t think they were gonna do it, but I was pretty excited when I saw it.”
USC coach Pete Carroll said Harfman impressed him. Making his debut at punter, the transfer from Mt. San Antonio averaged 46.3 yards per punt — a full nine yards better than his predecessor, redshirt junior Billy O’Malley.
The return: Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley’s return from a bone bruise in his right shoulder was deemed a success, as the passing game opened up immediately for the Trojans. Barkley finished the day completing 13-of-22 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns.
“You can see that it hurt USC not having him last week,” Washington State coach Paul Wulff said in his post-game press conference. “For a freshman, he did some good things.”
It took Barkley only a few throws to find his stroke. On his seventh toss of the night, he hit redshirt freshman Brice Butler for a 29-yard touchdown pass. On his eighth, he found Williams for another touchdown.
“From a receiver’s standpoint, we’ve been waiting to go deep,” said redshirt freshman Brice Butler, whose catch was his first-career touchdown reception. “We’ve been hungry for it, and we saw today that we can do it so hopefully we come out every week and do it.”
Most valuable player: Outside linebacker Michael Morgan. The redshirt junior had a game-high 2.5 sacks and five tackles in his fifth career start.
He was chosen to do the post-game press conference with the media, alongside Barkley.
The unassuming Morgan, who traditionally operates out of the spotlight, said it was unusual for him.
“I was more nervous in there than I was on the field,” he said later.
Surprise performer: Redshirt freshman defensive end Nick Perry continued to impress with another two-sack performance. He has now registered six sacks in four games, good for a team-high. The six sacks are the most for a Trojan since Lawrence Jackson’s 10.5 in 2007.
Stat of the game: The first quarter was by far the Trojans’ most productive — in both positive and negative yardage.
USC scored 20 points and produced 195 yards of offense in the first 15 minutes of play, but also lost 75 yards on seven penalties.
“I can’t explain that,” Butler said. “I really don’t know. I really don’t know.”
Quotes of the game: No. 6 Cal’s 42-3 loss earlier in the day to Pac-10 rival Oregon was on many a player’s mind.
With the Trojans set to face the Bears in Berkeley next Saturday, they were looking ahead — and behind, to the loss to Washington last week.
“It does surprise me, but it doesn’t,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo said. “Because you could say that about the week before up in Seattle. It just so happens that Oregon stepped up this week and beat a good Cal team.”
Added O’Dowd: “It’s a Pac-10 game in the Pac-10 conference. You don’t know what could happen, and we’re an example of that as well.”
The coaches do not have the team properly prepared.  They get off to a lead and lose focus.  I have been watching USC football since the 50’s and was very disappointed with the last two games.  The mistakes and penalties are a sign of a loss of concentration.  ‘We know we are physically better and faster so we don’t have to think or play our best’, seems to be the feeling out there.  The new coaches are used to working with professionals, these are just kids.  A penalty or error on almost every play involving special teams does not speak well of the new coach.

We hear about violence all the time, whether while watching local news reports or reading the Los Angeles Times.
The news always deals with the same topics: theft, muggings, shootings, stabbings, extortion, kidnappings, rapes — the list goes on. After hearing about a particular incident, most people’s reactions are generally the same: a brief condemnation of the act followed by some sort of phrase either criticizing law enforcement or blaming the victim for not knowing better.
Amy Schilit | Daily Trojan
That’s about it.
But gang violence in Los Angeles has become commonplace, a sort of symbol for the city. People in Los Angeles have become inured to it.
Many of us avoid the gang-ridden areas and are unaffected by the terrorism many of their fellow Angelenos are facing miles across town — the terror of not knowing whether one may be unlucky enough to be caught in the line of fire between two warring gangs fighting for control of a couple of blocks.
LAPD has taken steps to fight gang violence in the city. Statistics show a slow but steady decline of gang-related violence in the city over the past couple years. Just a week ago, the LAPD conducted a massive operation against the notorious Avenues gang operating near Glassell Park. More than 1,200 police officers raided the area and apprehended nearly 50 gang members. The crackdown crippled the gang’s influence in the area  and is likely to reduce its ability to gain new members.
But LAPD may be focusing too much on high-profile arrests and not enough on solving the underlying causes of gang violence.
LAPD already implements several programs to help troubled kids who might be inclined to join gangs. Jeopardy, which targets 8- to 17-year- old boys and girls, offers boxing and martial arts classes to children who might have family members in gangs, and LAPD’s Youth Advocacy Program and Deputy Auxiliary Police initiative target children and teens. But many of these programs are opt-in, and LAPD could be more proactive in getting young people to join.
The city has also made a high-profile push to root out gang violence and prevent children from gravitating toward gangs. In 2007, Mayor Villaraigosa created a new Office of Gang Reduction and Youth Development, and has centralized the process of reducing violence. The city has also targeted specific areas — Youth Development Zones, as they’re called — and moved resources into those areas.
If Los Angeles is truly committed to ridding the city of gangs, though, it must address some of the factors that cause them to join gangs in the first place: lack of security, money and self-respect. Social and community programs that foster a safe environment for kids to learn different skills and activities should be expanded.
Other offerings could train students in specific skills to help them find jobs quickly. If these programs could be institutionalized at a city-wide level, the arrests and raids may not be as necessary. Most importantly, if would given young people a choice between joining a gang and earning a living.
Which brings us to the money. Many teens join gangs to earn some extra cash or to support siblings and even parents. Los Angeles ought to set up a database or agency specifically targeting to inner-city teens who are looking for jobs. By offering teens places to work, the chance of teens joining gangs may lessen.
The question then, as always, is how to fund these programs. The answer lies in a combination of a neighborhood investment and large contributions from the city’s main educational institutions: colleges, universities and high schools. Gang violence affects the entire city, and educational institutions most of all. High school students in parts of Los Angeles are lured to gangs, and we at USC are not immune: the drive-by shooting of a USC track star last year was a stark reminder of how gang violence can invade any part of the city. These programs, if successful, would be a small investment that could have a huge impact in Los Angeles’ future.
And universities like USC could use these programs as opportunities for students to make a difference in their community and implement what they learn in the classroom. USC’s Joint Education Project could serve as a model for city-wide programs. Students from any major could participate, whether political science majors working with the city’s government, art majors teaching teens different forms of personal expression to spur creativity, theater majors playing improv games or chemistry majors that visit high school science classes and perform experiments. A collaboration between this city’s colleges and universities could create a broad workforce for these programs. High school students could also volunteer to fulfill community service requirements.
Arresting gang members reduces crime in a particular area for short periods of time, but it can’t permanently solve the problem. Los Angeles needs an innovative solution that encompasses all aspects of the city’s resources and population.
We shouldn’t accept gang violence as a part of Los Angeles anymore.

Sunday, Sept. 27 – Hollywood Forever
It looks inconspicuous enough online: “09.27.09: Los Angeles, CA — Hollywood Forever Cemetery (sunrise show).” The same font and color as every date on Bon Iver’s “Tour” page, followed by the same link to purchase tickets. The parentheses and words contained within marks the only difference between the various events. In retrospect, this nonchalant mention of an unconventional showtime seems a preposterous understatement. This was not simply a concert beginning as night turns to day, though that would have been exceptional enough. This was a seven-hour experience planned and executed by the artists themselves with delicate care and attention to detail simply not found in today’s world of promoters and tour managers.
For all the obscure and intriguing events planned, however, the night begins modestly. The regal and majestic gates at the entrance to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery remain firmly shut as attendees slip in through a nondescript side entrance and, after a brief stop at the folding table serving as ticket booth, disappear into the dimly lit grounds.

The doors, or rather, door, opens at midnight for the 6 a.m. concert, so the usual crowds and lines are curiously absent. A distant glow through the midnight fog and a few fellow concertgoers in the immediate vicinity are the only indications that something is in fact going on and you aren’t completely deranged for wandering into a cemetery after hours.
In migrating toward that distant glow and the ethereal melody that accompanies it, each group carves its own path through gravestones that range from monolithic shrines to stones that lay flat against the ground. One gets lost in the names and displays, trying to lay eyes on each of the captivating memorials.
The serene tour abruptly ends as wooded paths give way to the night’s largest gathering thus far. About 30 patrons gather around a small table covered in pastries and a booth from which coffee seems to flow like Willy Wonka’s river of chocolate — both provided free of charge. Once the initial shock from the provision of refreshments wears off — when most concerts attempt to nickel and dime their attendees at every turn — the source of the mysterious glow becomes apparent. The cemetery’s open lawn is covered in a patchwork of blankets and revelry, and those not entrenched in conversation with their peers gaze with wide-eyed wonder at the broad side of a white stone structure.
Programs litter the ground and reveal that Bon Iver’s hand-selected schedule has been providing entertainment since the night began. Two “DJ Sets” of handpicked music ranging from D’Angelo to the Vienna Boys Choir precede a viewing of Wes Anderson’s 1996 comedy Bottle Rocket. Planet Earth’s “Jungles” comes next and is followed by “5:15 AM: Blessing of Audience and Stage By Buddhist Monks”.
Sure enough, at 5:15 a.m. sharp, a procession of seven Buddhist monks in traditional orange robes appears in a small garden between the screen and adjacent stage. For the next 15 minutes, a chorus of intricate monosyllabic harmonies pour from their mouths with the precision and careful synchronization characteristic of, well, Buddhist monks.
The crowd itself represents a compelling mix of Los Angeles’ more eccentric cultural underbelly. To be sure, USC and UCLA garb dots the premises, but one also stumbles upon those like Sebastian, a rogue of a man in a tight leather jacket and even tighter jeans, a floppy leather hat sitting atop his disheveled mop. He and his similarly attired confidants swig wine while coaxing the last few hits from their near-finished blunt. Midnight graveyard shows seem to attract every sort of fan.
Shortly after the monks finish bestowing their blessings upon the stage and audience, Bon Iver begins its set without any of the tedious sound checks or egotistical stalling preferred by some of its musical contemporaries. In fact, nothing about the bands music or demeanor showed the slightest sense of such entitlement. Lead singer Justin Vernon donned a white T-shirt and the unkempt locks of someone who, as he later admitted to doing, just woke up from a nap. He then, with the help of his equally unpretentious bandmates, proceeds play the type of soulful, emotionally invested music that seems properly suited to usher night into day. The unassuming Vernon apologizes for the fact that band’s solitary album provides only a limited number of songs to perform, before he mentions that instead of concluding the show with the usual back-and-forth between artist and audience known as the encore, Bon Iver would be finishing its music before leaving the stage. For good. Seriously.
The band then played its last song, “Wolves (Acts I and II),” with the audience providing the aching, echoing chorus. They then thanked everyone who made the event possible and, as promised, promptly exited stage left in a manner that typified their evening. As extraordinary as the night’s events were, they did not speak to some higher genius of those who planned them. This was an artist deciding to leave the confines of the same show times at the same clubs and instead plan a night that he felt his fans would enjoy. It just makes sense, to the point that one becomes curious and almost annoyed as to why most bands refuse to branch out and present their art in a more unique way. After all, these are artists we’re talking about, whose performances are, at base, expressions of their own personal creativity. Why so many choose to present their work within the same exact frame as so many have done before them seems completely counterintuitive to the idea of individual artistic expression. It doesn’t need to be a seven-hour graveyard experience, but it doesn’t seem like asking too much to expect something creative and uncommon from those who call themselves artists.

Friday, Sept. 25 – The Wiltern
Justin Vernon might be a deity, hidden beneath a shaggy, unkempt mane and rugged blanket of facial hair.
The 28-year-old singer-songwriter genius behind the indie folk band Bon Iver is not so much a musician as a creator of spiritual experiences — like the one he initiated at the Wiltern on Friday night.
A testament to Vernon’s musical ingenuity, the concert was the kind of event you only have the good fortune to experience a few times in your life — the kind that takes you out of the mundane and into the realm of the extraordinary.
Most of the set was dedicated to Bon Iver’s 2007 self-released debut, For Emma, Forever Ago, a collection of contemplative songs that sprung from a cathartic period of isolation spent in a frozen Wisconsin cabin in the middle of the winter (the name Bon Iver comes from the French “bon hiver,” for good winter).
Vernon’s arresting vocals, strikingly understated melodies and precise balance of instrumentals instantly catapulted For Emma, Forever Ago — as well as this year’s equally moving four-song EP, Blood Bank — to sanctified indie status.
But if his music cuts deep on recordings, it devastates live. Vernon’s agonizingly beautiful falsetto single-handedly brought the Wiltern’s packed house to its knees.
After a delightful opening by the heavily bearded (the clean-shaven were the minority that night), pastoral folk group Megafaun, which produced sounds ranging from clean, folksy harmonies to discordant instrumental chaos, Bon Iver took the stage in a modest flourish.
Vernon humbly settled with his guitar in an unassuming corner of the stage, establishing himself as just another member of the band. If you didn’t know any better, you might have overlooked the woodsy, scraggly-haired man tucked away like a hidden treasure.
Until, of course, he opened his mouth.
Vernon’s prophetic voice flooded the Wiltern from the very first lines of the opening song “Lump Sum,” rendering the crowd powerless in its wake. You could almost hear the collective sighs as his pure, sensuous vocals caressed the audience like the warmth of a fire on a winter evening.
Thus began the crowd’s intimate coupling with Bon Iver Friday night — an affair that only intensified as the band unfolded its immaculate nine-song set (fitting, since For Emma, Forever Ago also consists of nine songs).
It goes without saying that Bon Iver’s quietest, stripped-down moments were its most powerful. Vernon took the stage alone with his guitar for “Flume” and “Re: Stacks,” offering two crushingly exposing performances. “Babys,” with its ethereal piano motif and ebbing and flowing falsetto harmonies, felt like a spiritual experience in and of itself, especially as it made its final descent into dissonance.
But the accompanying instruments of Bon Iver proved vital during the rest of the show: A potent drumbeat carried “Creature Fear” and “Brackett, WI,” a song from indie compilation record Dark Was The Night, while a banjo enlivened “Skinny Love” and a consortium of guitars buttressed Vernon’s intoxicating voice in an energetic rendition of “Blood Bank.”
Even in the band’s louder moments, the overriding message of the night was that of raw simplicity and grateful humility — a message furthered by the band’s low-key appearance, no-frills stage set and Vernon’s frequent, genuine words of thanks.
The climax of the night arrived when Vernon invited the audience to sing along to the refrain of  “The Wolves (Act I and II).” As the crowd repeated the wistful line — What might have been lost — again and again, louder and louder, the noise from the stage escalated to overpowering levels, vibrating even the innermost recesses of the theater.
Then came an explosion of sound, a moment of total clarity and darkness.
Such a powerful exit could only leave the crowd wanting more, and when the audience erupted into pleas for an encore, the band was eager to oblige.
Bon Iver returned to the stage with a graceful performance of “For Emma,” then closed the night alongside Megafaun with two upbeat acoustic numbers. As charming as it was, the encore seemed a little lost on the crowd, which was still reeling in the aftermath of a powerful spiritual awakening.
“Thank you so much for listening,” an immensely gratified Vernon repeated for the hundredth — and last — time.
If only the man knew how many souls were indebted to him that night.

Love in the workplace is usually frowned upon — and for good reason. Innocent flirtation and casual eye sex with a foxy coworker can be fun and harmless. Intraoffice dating, however, is an occupational hazard destined to end in catastrophe.
While the ill effects of the office relationship are widely known, even the best and the brightest attorneys at my law firm decided to take a crack at it.
In fact, the managing partner was rumored to have an intimate relationship with one of the female partners.
Of course, it’s possible that these two high-powered attorneys were just close friends — two close friends who spent an inordinate amount of time with one another. But would a friend walk into another friend’s office and turn down all the framed photographs of her husband?
Because the pair apparently did not deem the 60 hours they spent together each workweek sufficient, they would also come into the office together on weekends to do the P90X workout DVDs. The one time I had the privilege of seeing the tandem workout in action, the lady partner was wearing a spaghetti-strap tank top paired with spandex booty shorts. Her husband likely would not approve of the managing partner spotting her from behind as she raised and lowered her glistening physique on the pull-up bar.
Somewhere between the workouts, photo-flipping, regular lunches and visits to each others’ offices, the managing partner’s spouse started to catch on and was none too pleased. When all of the partners and their significant others were invited to a young attorney’s wedding, the wife put her foot down and refused to attend if “the other woman” would be in attendance.
Moments like this taught me early on in my time at the law firm that mixing work and play is a lot like mixing a drink with Bacardi 151 — seems fun while you’re doing it, but the price you pay afterwards is never worth it.
So when I was presented with an opportunity to forge my own office relationship, I knew I had to politely decline. Sure, it was easier for me than most because my suitor — the firm’s facilities clerk — wasn’t exactly the man of my dreams. From now on, I will refer to my personal office admirer as “Pinkie,” after the color of his nubby, cartridge-stained fingers.
One day while I was working at the law firm over winter break, Human Resources sent out an email around 10 a.m. stating that all employees were permitted to leave before the lunch hour in order to avoid icy road conditions. As we were leaving the building, Pinkie stopped and asked me if I want to go home with him to play board games at his apartment. As tempted as I already was by this offer, he nearly convinced me when he added that he had a spare Aero mattress for me to sleep on.
“Sorry,” I said. “I don’t play board games with people who are 30-plus.”
“I’m 29,” he replied.
“False,” I retorted as I hightailed it to my car before things could go any further.
Even though he was a little forward and creepy in his approach, I genuinely enjoyed Pinkie’s company. No, I probably wouldn’t have played Parcheesi with him under any fathomable circumstances, but I definitely would have considered a quick lunch with him at the local Panera Bread. But after one too many comments about how charming I was and how the 10-year age disparity wasn’t that much, I knew we had very different ideas about the nature and closeness of our rapport.
Giving him even the slightest reason to think that our in-office friendship might one day translate into something more could have been dangerous and required me to break off a perfectly good friendship.
In normal circumstances, when you break up with someone, you can start by divvying up the mutual friends and then deleting the phone number, email address and pin number, then top it off by terminating the Facebook friendship. At this point, you’ve officially freed yourself of all ties and wiped your hands clean of the sticky situation.
But when you date someone at work, you either have to quit your job — not exactly the best decision in an economy with an almost 10 percent unemployment rate — or, even worse, are forced to come into contact with the person in a professional setting on a daily basis. This means flipping them off as they walk past your cubicle is no longer a viable option.
And with so many fish in the sea, is it really necessary to cast your hook into the same small pond you work in?
In the case of passionate vs. professional, it is the judgment of this column that you shall be sentenced to a life term of in-office awkwardness should you canoodle in the copy room instead of concentrating at your cubicle.

Remind me to glue down the family photos!
This is funny. My brother works at a law firm and apparently he sees the same garbage go on–nasty ex-couples spreading rumours about each other and little relations starting. Office relationships are definitely a no-go

Two recent high-profile terror cases have made the chilling reality that terrorism is still a threat all too clear.
The first was an al-Qaida suicide bombing attempt on a Saudi prince. The assailant was able to get close enough to actually blow himself up in the same room as the Saudi leader. His method? Hiding explosives inside his body, where they did not react to metal detectors. Aside from the bomber, there were no civilian casualties because the bombs detonated downward, blowing a large cavity in the earth instead of harming the prince. Nevertheless, this disturbing new innovation could revitalize the terrorist threat. It could particularly affect airport security.
The second case is perhaps more disturbing because it takes place closer to home. Najibullah Zazi was born in Afghanistan and spent several years in Pakistan during his youth, but the majority of his teenage and adult years were spent in the United States. He worked a series of service-related jobs: in a grocery store, for an airport limo service and at his father’s coffee cart in Lower Manhattan. He was known as a friendly, conscientious worker who had become increasingly religious in recent years.
Now the 24-year-old is being held without bail by the FBI as a suspected terrorist. Zazi is accused of receiving explosives training in Pakistan and buying large quantities of bomb-making chemicals in the form of beauty products.
Authorities honed in on Zazi on Sept. 6 when he began an overnight drive from Denver to New York City. It is suspected that Zazi planned a commuter train bombing to coincide with the 9/11 anniversary. He has not been proven guilty and Zazi denies the claims.
There are several disturbing qualities to Zazi’s case. On the one hand, if the FBI’s accusations prove incorrect, it will spark a wave of anti-Americanism and claims of religious persecution both within US borders and abroad.
But if Zazi is proven guilty of harboring terrorist ambitions, faithful Muslims around the country could face new suspicion and fear that is unwarranted — and yet understandable. For if Zazi did in fact trick everyone from the customs agents in JFK airport (he traveled to Pakistan multiple times to visit family) to his daily customers at the coffee cart, then couldn’t any extremist do the same?
We are often told when we board trains or buses to be on the lookout for suspicious behavior. The problem that this case highlights is one that has really existed all along: How can we know what “terrorist behavior” looks like?
The fact is that terrorists can be all kinds of people — not just the ones whose pictures we often see on TV. So how do we reconcile our duty to know what “terrorist behavior” looks like with our undeniable obligation to treat all of our peers equally?
Former President George W. Bush may have made poor policy decisions in later years, but one thing he did do well was assure Americans in the wake 9/11 that not all Muslims were a threat. In his 2001 State of the Union address, Bush said that “the enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends.” In the weeks following the attacks, American Muslims were reassured that they would not be blamed for the actions of an extremist minority.
Americans must think critically. Under no circumstances can we tolerate baseless religious profiling. American Muslims deserve the respect and equal treatment that the United States upholds as its highest values.
Of course, idealism and a moral high ground may not be enough of an incentive for everyone. For those critics, it is worthwhile to note that Zazi’s case is actually positive when considered from a national security perspective. Long before his alleged planned attack, Zazi’s every move was being tracked by FBI agents.
If nothing else, we can rest assured that our government is doing everything possible to locate terrorists within our nation. Eight years after 9/11, the terrorist threat is still very real. But rather than taking it upon ourselves to judge, let’s respect our country’s vigilance and innovation, and let the government do the terror-hunting for us.

The reason we would not profile Irish Americans based on McVeigh simply comes down to numbers. How many McTerrorists have we had on US soil?
The problem with this article and people who support its sentiments is that we live in such a ridiculously politically correct society that we would rather be blown up then admit we see the 800-lb gorilla jihadist. BTW, in polite company we may claim we do not prejudge but in reality we prejudge all the time.. It is part of our human self-defense mechanism. It is duplicitous and condescending whenever I hear people, especially in LA, claim they do not prejudge when behind closed doors all they do is judge people non-stop..
The question we are faced with in the world  today is even messier and fuzzier around the edges then a simple question should we profile? The messy question is even if it meant offending innocent people, if it will prevent a 9/11 magnitude attack should we profile. Catching bad guys is not a pin point surgical science – sometimes a large net needs to be thrown. The question is do we throw the net knowing innocent people might be inconvenienced in the process or do we not  throw the net and allow guilty people to slip through the cracks? What I hate is when self-righteous people benefit from the safety provided by the net-throwers and then wagging their crooked little, self righteous finger saying profiling is bad, bad, bad. Get a clue people, there are entire flocks of credulous sheep willing to blow themselves and others up – die a beautiful death for an imaginary god that can not stand breakfast sausage and ham.
I agree with Joseph. After the Oklahoma bombings (which has been the deadliest in the US in terms of how much damage a single terrorist – Timothy McVeigh, caused), we should have profiled all Irish Americans. That would have taught them a lesson.
Just playing devil’s advocate here: What’s so baseless about religious profiling?

USC’s energy contract with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power expires at the end of the year, and both the university and DWP are looking for ways to produce more sustainable energy.
USC has been under contract with DWP for 10 years, according to Matthew Oden, manager of the USC Sustainability Program, and that contract has prevented the school from implementing more sustainable practices.
Once the contract is up, however, the school and DWP will likely work out a memorandum of understanding — a non-legally binding list of agreements outlining future projects and goals. DWP has been working on such agreements with many of its larger customers.
“I think that’s a reflection of how rapidly the landscape in the energy climate world is evolving right now that DWP doesn’t want to take the risk of getting locked into 10-year contracts,” Oden said.
The switch from contracts to MOUs would also allow USC to change the way it approaches energy consumption. Under its 10-year contract, USC has been required to get all of its energy from DWP and been unable to produce its own energy.
“There’s been a lot of inquiries about why USC doesn’t have solar  [power] on campus, and that’s the answer,” Oden said. “We haven’t been contractually been allowed to, and the bottom line of that is that it could be a good thing.”
Oden said, however, that USC won’t implement the DWP’s Solar Incentive Program once the MOU is drafted. The program asks customers like USC to purchase solar panels to power their own property. Any energy not used by the customer flows back to the city’s power grid and the customer receives a rebate and federal tax credits. Oden said such a program does not fit USC’s needs.
“We have energy efficiency projects that are cheaper and will reduce greenhouse gases more quickly,” Oden said. “Until we have all those done, it doesn’t make financial sense [to go solar] when we could be building large wind farms out in the desert.”
Mark Gangi, an expert on sustainable design, said by focusing on energy efficient projects, USC can earn  DWP rebates, which are offered for more than just use of solar panels, and can use the transition as a learning experience.
“It’s a great opportunity to actually have students in a building that teaches them about what they are studying that has value beyond economic analysis,” he said.
A Sept. 15 executive order signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger requires a statewide, 33 percent increase in renewable energy use by 2020. Oden said the order could be one reason why DWP plans to change the way it approaches its contracts.
DWP hopes to use 20 percent renewable energy by 2010 and 40 percent by 2020, said DWP spokeswoman Carol Tucker. Under California’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, which provides regulations and benchmarks for the statewide switch to renewable energy, DWP would use hydropower, wind power, biomass energy and geothermal energy.
To reach these benchmarks, DWP recently opened the largest municipally-owned wind farm in the country, located in Utah. Wind farms generate energy through turbines with  spinning blades creating electricity and transmitting the power back to LA. DWP is also agreeing to other projects and transmission lines to transport power from places farther than LA, Tucker said.
Although DWP is USC’s only source of energy, their new initiatives will not change the total amount of energy USC receives, Oden said.

There are endless assumptions made about the infamous fashion label Chanel and the woman behind its creation. While the name “Chanel” evokes visions of perfect tweed suits, black and white color schemes, eternal class and Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel herself was an infinitely more complex and radiant person than her designs may lead on. According to Anne Fontaine’s latest film, Chanel was down right rebellious and incredibly strong for a woman of her era.
Coco Before Chanel shows Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel as an ineffably powerful and liberated woman for her time, different than her more shallow and subordinate female counterparts. Chanel is played by Audrey Tautou (Amélie, The Da Vinci Code), who captures Chanel’s beauty as well as her rebelliousness in the subtle way that only Tautou can. Chanel’s boyish charm — manifested in the movie through the various outfits she creates from her lover’s clothes — and her daring attitude make Tautou shine in this genuinely entertaining yet sentimental film.

While the movie seems to depict the entire story of Chanel’s early life, some important events are left out (including the opening of a store in Paris before the one depicted in the film). Still, the main plotline of Coco Before Chanel focuses on the origin and creation of Chanel’s iconic style — as both the empress of the label’s empire and as a person.
Because viewers are constantly drawn to Chanel’s wry personality and bold interaction with others, they may forget about the fashion basis for Chanel’s story; inevitably, the film serves to remind them. One minute Chanel will be pondering an event to attend with her lover and the next she is cutting his shirt into pieces and making a dress; in another, partygoers compliment Chanel’s straw hat, motivating her to open a hat shop. Later, Chanel rides on one of lover Étienne Balsan’s (Benoît Poelvoorde) horses and endless jockey-inspired outfits appear. All of these fashion references remind viewers that this woman was, at her core, a designer. But Fontaine does an incredible job of making the audience forget how Chanel the brand is perceived today and focuses on where Chanel the individual drew inspiration.
The film begins with Chanel’s less-than-idealistic childhood as she is orphaned with her sister Adrienne Chanel (Marie Gillain). The sisters leave the orphanage once they are old enough and begin working as seamstresses and nightclub singers (their most popular song is about a little dog “Coco,” from which stemmed Chanel’s infamous nickname). The sisters struggle for money, and men become their main source of both economic stability and friendship (and for Coco, clothing). When Adrienne leaves Coco for one of her suitors, Chanel turns to an old friend and on-and-off lover,  Balsan.
Balsan treats Chanel poorly during most of her stay, making her perform for his affluent friends and banishing her away from his parties. Balsan’s crude mannerisms, which are absolutely nailed by Poelvoorde, and lavish ways of living are new to the humble Chanel; as a way to distract herself when he upsets her, Chanel takes an interest in his horses and creates hats that become rather popular with his bourgeoise girlfriends.
Balsan’s high-class status and social life is both intriguing and infuriating during her stay, but Chanel soon finds comfort in Balsan’s mysterious business partner Arthur “Boy” Capel (Alessandro Nivola). The two become instant friends and eventual lovers, connected by their equal disdain for Balsan’s arrogant nature, and their flourishing relationship incites an unexpected jealousy from the usually indifferent Balsan. Chanel’s love for Capel, however, is ruined by unfortunate circumstances and Chanel is crushed. Her incredible sorrow turns into devotion to designing and she creates her first fashion line — the line that becomes the iconic Chanel.
The viewer fosters a particular connection with Chanel in large part to Tautou’s brilliance. The character is both shy and womanly, yet assertive and manly; beautiful but boyish, and ever more modern than her female counterparts. The movie not only shows an unexpected side of Chanel, but of a female figure in this time. Fontaine has captured a woman’s personal liberation in a time when oppression of women was simply woven into the fabric of societal norms. While this is not immediately evident as Chanel’s story unfolds, the audience is left with the impression of Chanel’s unwavering strength and determintation.
The audience is absolutely engulfed by the moment even more so when tragedy strikes in Chanel’s life. Tautou’s performance is so heartfelt that an audience’s connection to her character is much greater than to an average character in an average film. This is also a testament to Fontaine’s talent as a director, for Coco Before Chanel is anything but average. While many movies are fluffy and aimless, leaving the audience feeling cheated when the end credits roll, Coco Before Chanel gives the audience more than what was expected.
Perhaps the French spoken in the film (with English subtitles) transports the audience further into the film, or perhaps Tautou’s performance is more gripping than most. Whatever the “it” factor is about Coco Before Chanel, it gives audiences more than they could expect or imagine from a fashion film, and it leaves them with a story of a woman who will forever remain unforgettable.

Students worried about shrinking wallets can breathe a little easier. Starting Monday, the Undergraduate Student Government is unveiling the new Student Savers Club, a discount service that will help USC students save at many restaurants, shops and salons across Los Angeles if they show their USC ID.
USG worked with the Student Savings Club, a service available to universities across the country, to negotiate with local businesses to compile a list of student discounts. USG will have to pay $1,700 to Student Savings Club every year they use the service, but the funds will come out of USG’s budget and will not cost students additional money, said Paige Hill, director of communications for USG.
Hill said USG thinks the program is worth the price.
“I think it’s really cool,” she said. “A lot of the places we’re offering discounts at are something all students can use … stuff that I ate yesterday I could have saved money on. It’s very practical, especially right now in this economy.”
Local businesses are also excited about the partnership.
“I think more than anything it’s going to bring us closer to that whole student body — get them in here and familiarize them with the venue and what we have to offer them,” said Timothy Whiteman, marketing manager for ESPN Zone at LA LIVE, where students can receive a 10 percent discount if they show their IDs.
But other stores said they’re not  expecting the Student Savers Club to be an economic boom.
“I think the discount will definitely help,” said Tina Plescia, the store manager for Lawry’s Carvery. “But I think just having more promotional ads or something would be beneficial to the location.”
Other discounts include 10 percent discounts at Kinko’s, Fatburger and Cold Stone Creamery; a buy one get one free deal at New Zealand Natural; and a complimentary birthday dinner at Zip Fusion.
The only expected kink, according to USG President Holden Slusher, is making sure businesses are giving students their discounts. Students will be able to report any problems they have with businesses on the USG website.
Students, however, still need to read the fine print, as some businesses have restrictions on the purchases that can be made using the discount.
“The 5 percent [discount] is normally not for all transactions, just certain items,” said Maria Verjan, manager of Office Depot on Figueroa Street.
While some venues, such as Robek’s, will offer a straight discount, other stores have caveats, such as Bronze Body’s 5 percent discount — offered only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Slusher explained that such restrictions were the inevitable result of negotiations between businesses and the Student Savings Club.
Although the program is just starting, USG is already looking ahead. Slusher said he hopes to run the Student Savers Club independently next year, to avoid paying the $1,700 fee to Student Savings Clubs. He noted, however, that using the Student Savings Club helped the program get off the ground.
“It would have taken a full year to put together a program like this, rather than things happening right now,” Slusher said. “The Senators were excited about getting a student-run one next year, so we don’t have to keep paying the annual fee.”

The University Park Health Center launched its Nutrition Series 2009 Monday, an effort to set itself apart from other nutritional programs by focusing on specific healthy food choices for students on campus,
The series, an attempt to steer students away from just counting calories, will be presented to students as interactive seminars at various locations on campus throughout this semester. Each seminar will be focused on a separate topic, such as the best foods for midterms and finals or food choices for athletes.
According to Patrice Barber, a registered dietitian at the health center who will be conducting the seminars, the goal of the series is to show students a simpler way to make decisions about food on campus.
“I would love to see students get basic, sound nutrition information and leave with confidence and excitement to put it into action in their lives,” Barber said.
Barber, who worked for USC Hospitality for eight years, said her experience there allowed her to learn about students’ interests and accumulate ideas for the program so that it can address their concerns.
She added that the specificity of the program sets it apart from other nutritional initiatives aimed at students, because it explains to them exactly how to deal with food choices, rather than general nutritional information about food ideals.
“You leave knowing what to eat. What students are after is what to eat right now,” Barber said. “You can pick up a book to read how many calories are in a gram of fat.”
The first session, titled “Beyond Pizza: Eating Well at EVK and Parkside,” to be held at the Lyon Center Monday, will include a discussion about what to choose from the array of menu options at the two dining halls. More broadly, it will also attempt to teach students how to handle environments in which they are bombarded with food options.
According to Barber, a key aspect of the sessions is to include interactive exercises in which students are shown healthier choices out of samples of common food items and to teach them to contend with their body images.
“We are surrounded by very indulgent food, and we’re also surrounded by messages of what our bodies are supposed to look like,” she said. “[At the sessions] we are going to talk about body
awareness and the role nutrition plays in it.”
For some nutritional experts, though, the usefulness of the programs is that it educates students about decisions they will be making all their life, rather than having them change their minds on the spot.
Robert  Girandola, an associate professor in kinesiology who teaches a course on nutrition and exercise and a freshman seminar on body image, believes the program will be helpful because it targets students at ages where they should learn to make healthy choices.
“In terms of maintaining health, the two key factors are exercise, or the lack thereof, and good diet. From 18 to 24, you should be at the best possible health in your life. After that, it is downhill,” he said.
Girandola believes students need to learn not to deprive themselves of their favorite foods, but need to make sure they do not live entirely on them.
Roger Clemens, an adjunct professor of pharmacology and pharmaceutical sciences and an expert in nutrition and the food industry, said learning to eat healthy would be beneficial for students in the long run, because it helps reduce personal costs, government costs and the general social burden of maintaining society’s health.
“It is important for everyone to make wiser choices,” Clemens said. “Improved food selection now will certainly improve health for later in life. Food selection is a lifetime investment.”
According to some students, though the aim of the nutritional campaign is positive, it will not necessarily cause people to change their mind.
Monet Hendricks, a freshman majoring in theatre, said she thinks the potential impact of the program is limited by the fact that eating habits are generally learned long before college.
“It would be beneficial for people who are set on changing their eating habits,” Hendricks said. “But for people who already know their eating habits, it would probably not be as beneficial.”
Hendricks added that people sometimes take the easier route even if they knew the food wasn’t healthy.
“Just because there is ice cream [at Parkside Restaurant], doesn’t mean you have to have ice cream.”
Kimberly Wong, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, believes that students have to make the personal choice to eat healthy even if they know what foods are good for them.
“The program is a good idea even if it does not work for everyone,” Wong said.

A million-dollar grant awarded to a team of USC researchers could make communication with doctors across language barriers a lot easier, thanks to a new advanced translation system.
The National Science Foundation grant of $2.2 million, awarded
Aug. 15, will fund four years of research on SpeechLinks, the translation system that researchers hope can go beyond basic word recognition to interpret emotion and intonation in speech.
“There’s much more going on in human speech than what we say,” said Shrikanth Narayanan, an engineering professor and the SpeechLinks project director. “What we speak and how we translate depends a lot on the context … You can say the same set of words and by changing one set’s intonation, the two can have a different meaning.”
Although voice recognition and basic emotion recognition software already exist, Narayanan said the marriage of the two makes the SpeechLinks project more unique.
Most speech-to-speech translation devices follow a pipeline approach, in which each element — speech recognition, conversion of words to text and translation into a foreign language — are all developed separately.
Narayanan, however, wants to integrate these elements. He said he wants to “capture the rich information in speech,” such as emotions.
He added that he hoped the software would be able to fulfill a need for “cross-language [and]
cross-cultural communication” in many professional settings, including in the health care industry.
Researchers will first test SpeechLinks in hospitals, in an effort to improve doctor-patient relationships when one speaks English as a second language.
“Take an urban center like Los Angeles,” Narayanan said. “There are a lot of people here who have limited or no proficiency in English — a language barrier can compromise health care treatment, so can we build a set of tools that can work with human translation abilities?”
Win May, an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine and a collaborator on the SpeechLinks project, said SpeechLinks would help health care facilities, many of which are required to provide access to translation services for patients who speak little or no English.
“However, these [translation] services may not be readily available,” May said. “So SpeechLinks will allow health care providers to communicate effectively with patients in lieu of a human interpreter.”
As director of the Clinical Skills, Education and Evaluation Center at the Keck School of Medicine, May will coordinate the medical students, actors and volunteers portraying real patients during the project’s test runs.
“We want to make sure the goal of being understood is met on both sides,” said Margaret McLaughlin, a collaborator on the project and a professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication.
McLaughlin, who has a background in conversation analysis and computer-mediated communication, became involved with the project after Narayanan approached her.
“The patient will be sensitive to whether or not the [human] interpreter is accurately relaying what they’re saying to the provider,” McLaughlin said. “We want them to have confidence that SpeechLinks is accurate in doing so.”
Narayanan also said SpeechLinks will be cost-effective because it will not depend on special equipment.
“Since it’s software-based, it can be run on any laptop computer and can potentially serve any number of users,” Narayanan said.
Narayanan added that he hopes to present the SpeechLinks technology at engineering, medicine and health care forums because of its interdisciplinary approach.
“This is a very exciting but also tremendously challenging problem,” Narayanan said. “But even small steps can result in big impacts in our communities.”

Just days after USC’s Career Fair, the New York Times reported the number of job seekers is six times the number of openings – a record high.
And though that’s a scary prospect for seniors who will be kicked out of the haven of academia and into the real world far too soon, USC grads seem to have stayed above the unemployment fray – at least so far.
“We’ve hit a plateau,” said Eileen Kohan, executive director of the Career Planning and Placement Center. “Our class last year did much better at finding jobs than the national average and that took place right around the time companies were having their problems.”
How this year’s Career Fair played out and how this year’s class will fare has yet to be seen. Based on the trends reported by the NYT, though, it’d be a surprise if the trend doesn’t hit USC grads soon. Job openings, according to the article, have decreased 45 percent in the South and West – the most of any region in the U.S. – since the beginning of the recession in Dec. 2007.

It was never close, but it may not have been enough to satiate everyone’s appetite.
USC players filtered onto the field and into the tunnel with a business-like approach following their Saturday night victory. The stated mission of walking away with a win had been fulfilled, but plenty of opportunities had been left on the field.
A week after being upset by Washington, the Trojans bounced back with little resistance. The return of Matt Barkley revitalized USC’s offense and helped the Trojans coast to a 27- 6 win against Washington State at the Coliseum on Saturday.
Yet there was still a sense among USC coaches and players that the Trojans, who entered the game as 45-point favorites, could have made the game even easier.
“The way I look at this game, we have a lot of work to do,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “It was not at all the satisfying win that we would have liked to have had.”
In his first game back from a bruised right shoulder, Barkley showed few lingering effects of the injury by throwing for 136 yards in the first quarter. Despite still feeling some pain when going through his throwing motion, the true freshman heaved the ball downfield early and often, finishing with 247 yards on 13-of-22 passing with 2 touchdowns.
“When I had to gun it, I did,” Barkley said. “It hurt a little, but that’s football.”
After the Trojans finished with 110 yards passing last week against the Huskies, the team’s emphasis on attacking downfield was palpable.
“We knew we could stretch them vertically,” Barkley said. “I think we hit what we could when it was there.”
Barkley connected with wide receiver Brice Butler in the corner of the end zone for his first touchdown. After kicker Jacob Harfman recovered the ensuing onside kick, Barkley threw a dart over the middle to Damian Williams, who dashed into the end zone untouched for a 57-yard touchdown.
USC’s rushing attack supplemented the passing game with several long runs to start the game. The Trojans needed only 13 carries in the first half to rack up 113 yards.
The offensive momentum established by the Trojans in the early going was thrown off by a season-high 13 penalties for 115 yards. Although Carroll said he took issue with a number of the flagged plays, he admitted that he was not content with the self-imposed mistakes.
“We had so many situations where we made it hard on ourselves,” Carroll said. “We need to keep working on it.”
USC’s defense held its ground for the majority of the four quarters. Defensive end Nick Perry and linebacker Michael Morgan combined for 4.5 sacks for a defensive unit that applied constant pressure to the opposing quarterbacks.
A week after earning their first win of the season by taking down Southern Methodist, the Cougars’ lone reason for optimism was their ability to stay in the game with a revamped defense.
Marshall Lobbestael started the game at quarterback but was spelled midway through the second quarter by Jeff Tuel. The two signal-callers only could muster 144 passing yards on the night, with a bulk of the production coming in the fourth quarter against USC’s second-string defense.
The Cougars controlled the second quarter with a 19-play drive that ate up more than eight and a half minutes. But despite controlling the ball and going 58 yards downfield, Washington State saw its 34-yard field goal attempt miss wide left as the first half expired.
Late in the fourth quarter, however, the Cougars turned a short field created by an Aaron Corp turnover into a touchdown, ending USC’s shutout hopes.
The match was a far cry from the Trojans’ 69-0 drubbing of the Cougars last year in Pullman, Wash. With Saturday’s trip to Cal looming, many Trojans insisted that the team has yet to show its best effort.
“We know what we’re capable of, and I think we showed that tonight,” Barkley said. “But I also think we’re capable of more.”
