Ramadan, determined by the lunar cycle, began Friday evening, marking the first time since the start of the pandemic that Muslim families broke their fast together and gathered to pray without coronavirus restrictions. 
Typically lasting for 29 or 30 days — depending on the sighting of the moon — Ramadan is a sacred time for Muslims to worship God and an opportunity for devotion and reflection. From dawn to sunset, Muslim students at USC will join communities observing Ramadan around the world in balancing work, study and school while fasting. 
“[With] zero consumption until sunset, it is very challenging to study, and the long days under the Los Angeles sun exaggerate the feelings of hunger and thirst,” said Hafeez Mir, the sophomore representative of the Muslim Student Union who is majoring in accounting. 
Muslims forego feelings of comfort for the sake of their Lord, and Ramadan serves as a time where one is taught to overcome hardships, Mir said.
“Beyond abstinence from eating and drinking, Ramadan entails prayers and reflection to achieve greater taqwa [consciousness of God]. It is working even harder than any other time on prayers and bettering ourselves,” Mir said. “In other words, a spiritual and emotional cleansing.”
The MSU has several initiatives for the Muslim community on campus. Every day during the holy month, the Union will be offering dates and water, following the Prophetic tradition, to students for iftaar, a meal eaten at sunset to break the fast. Two community iftaars and an iftaar banquet have also been planned. Taraweeh, an Islamic prayer performed nightly during Ramadan, will also be led by two Trojans — Aaqib Ismail, a senior majoring in computer science, and Jamil Khoja, who graduated in 2021 with a degree in finance — at the University Religious Center.
Talha Rafique, a sophomore majoring in computer science who serves as MSU’s community director, said he hopes these initiatives will help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety Muslim students might be facing. Rafique said he is confident that having the 20 cycles of the Taraweeh on-campus will provide a sense of security to students worried about their safety while walking to local mosques every night.
“Students will be able to partake in Taraweeh on campus, which is a safe place to do it, as well as have fellow students to lead it who will also be time-conscious of their time,” Rafique said.
Taraweeh is a significant aspect of the holy month to Muslims as they attempt to complete reading the whole Quran, said Ismail. Muslims believe that the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad began during the month of Ramadan. 
The combination of fasting long days, praying until late at night and studying can be physically demanding, but Zakariya Syed, a freshman majoring in cinema and media studies, said there is no other way to observe Ramadan for him.
“While it is challenging to study, complete assignments, perform extra prayers at night and wake up very early for Suhoor [a morning meal before sunrise], it is also gratifying,” Syed said.
USC Hospitality is collaborating with MSU to create Suhoor to-go boxes, which can be picked up every evening and stored for consumption during Suhoor. 
“These Suhoor to-go boxes will be available at Everybody’s Kitchen on campus and can be paid for by swipes or cards,” Rafique said.  
Beyond offerings and services, Mir said that “the MSU wants to cultivate a strong sense of community.”
“This will be the first Ramadan during school and away from home for many,” he said. “With a strong backing of peers experiencing similar situations, we hope to help each other have a successful Ramadan.”
Zain Saquib, a freshman majoring in economics and an international student from Pakistan, said he is excited to spend Ramadan with peers for the first time. 
“It will be a change spending my first Ramadan away from home and not being able to have home-cooked food,” Saquib said. “However, the Muslim community is great at USC, and I am looking forward to enjoying Ramadan with them and being able to experience many of the things I did at home like Taraweeh and iftaars.”

USC established a partnership with the U.S. Space Force that will foster STEM research and leadership development, as well as scholarships and mentorship opportunities for USC students, faculty and Air Force cadets. 
The smallest and newest military branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Space Force was founded in 2019 to protect American communication and satellites and to deter conflict in space. 
President Carol Folt signed a memorandum of understanding in a ceremony celebrating the partnership in late February. USC joined 13 other Space Force university partners, including the Georgia Institute of Technology, Howard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. USC was selected for its strong ROTC programs, diversity, commitment to military veterans and families, STEM-degree programs and space-related research. 
Several USC institutions, such as the Institute for Creative Technologies and the Information Sciences Institute, conduct research relevant to the space field. The Space Engineering Research Center, a joint venture between the Information Sciences Institute and the USC Department of Astronautical Engineering, works on several projects including hands-on build, test and flight demonstrations of spacecraft and satellites.
“This first step in the university partnership with the Space Force will help to advance STEM research that supports national security objectives,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The partnership augments the work of numerous USC research teams that have already made meaningful discoveries in the realm of aerospace research. Our Space Force collaboration will also help to forge a diverse group of leaders from our student body and faculty.”
USC’s history of support for military veterans and families stretches back to World War I, when the University served as a naval preparatory flight cadet school. The University started developing officers for the U.S. Space and Air Forces in 2020. Detachment 060, an Air Force ROTC program situated on the USC campus, trains 93 students, drawing from colleges and universities across California, including Biola University and Pasadena City College. The cohort is almost balanced between female and male students, and a majority identify as part of underrepresented groups.  
Through this agreement and others with universities in the University Partnership program, Space Force hopes to recruit and educate a diverse, high-quality workforce with the technical and problem-solving skills to help advance space-related research and the U.S. space system in preparation for a “congested and contested” future in the space domain. 
“UPP will open opportunities for collaboration with our nation’s brightest minds to take on the engineering, science and technology challenges facing the Space Force,” U.S. Space Force spokesperson Lynn Kirby wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
The agreement opens up more opportunities and pathways for USC students to participate in military and civil service, and contributes to the understanding and protection of space through leadership and research. 
“It will provide a consistent pipeline of STEM talent to the U.S. Space Force via scholarship, internship and mentorship opportunities for ROTC cadets, university students and faculty,” Kirby said.
Long Tran, an ROTC student and a senior studying electrical and computer engineering, said he believes the partnership will strengthen students’ awareness of the U.S. Space Force and evolving threats and technologies. 
“The Space Force actually provides a lot of different opportunities of getting work experience through internships, as well as understanding the changing environment around the world, in terms of new weapon capabilities as well as entering a new age of warfare,” Tran said.

Contrasting red and blue hues painted the stage of Massman Theatre during the opening night of Brand New Theatre’s production of “The Bridge of Birds” Friday. The small forum would soon come alive with a larger-than-life and timely story on love and family as envisioned by director Violet Ko, a senior majoring in theater, and playwright Eden Treiman, a junior majoring in theater and narrative studies. 
BNT’s first full-length production since the University’s return to in-person instruction, “The Bridge of Birds” takes a modern spin on a Korean folktale. Revolving around the holiday of Chilseok, the tale focuses on two lovers separated by their parents and the Milky Way Galaxy. Only allowed to see each other once a year but unable to cross the Milky Way, magpies form a bridge for the couple to cross after hearing their sorrowful cries. While the play is far from the original telling of Chilseok, the bridge of magpies inspired Treiman’s writing and the name of her play. 
After the lights dim and spring back to life, the audience meets Helen (Mai Yang), who has survived the struggles in her life through fairytales such as Chilseok. Introducing the play with her monologue, Helen states, “There is a story that has been told for centuries. Millenia. One as old as the stars themselves. But, it’s changing.” As imagery of stars and birds cover the walls of the Massman behind her, Helen poses as the main narrator for the story, telling it once more in hopes that this time it will have a “happy ending.” 
As the five-act play progresses, the audience meets Helen’s son, George (Henry Tsai), who comes off as the traditional first-generation kid. With dreams of success and hopefulness in returning the favor to his mother, George embarks to Los Angeles for opportunity. There, he meets Jenny (Kiana Fong), the daughter of Korean immigrants (Thomas Winter and Rebecca Ko) who run a dry cleaning store. 
While Jenny and George do not get off on the right foot –– as George’s stereotypical Bay Area pretentious fuckboy characteristics are brilliantly depicted by Tsai’s acting –– the two grow closer as their playful exchanges turn into a deeper conversation about their greatest fears and insecurities.
More and more backstory unravels and the audience learns more about each character’s struggles. Constantly facing roadblock after roadblock, Jenny, like many of us when overwhelmed by the weight of the world, crashes down to earth after the high of young love quickly dissipates. Forced to choose between her lover and her family, Jenny feels a sense of responsibility for her parents yet continues to yearn for true love and freedom. However, her progression from youth to motherhood not only inspires but questions a key part of life — “What is love?” — a question that both Jenny and the audience can only answer themselves.
Put simply, a lot goes down in the two-hour play. The audience appeared to have visceral reactions to the action on stage and the actors, too, fed off of the crowd’s energy as they exchanged words. Each table slam, tear and outburst only better illustrated each character’s anguish and internal lament. 
“The reason you have that kind of reaction is because the audience is so invested in the story, in the characters, that they have a visceral and emotional response to it, and that’s always a good sign,” said Winter, a senior majoring in economics and theatre.
Ko, a sophomore majoring in theatre, perfectly plays a sympathetic but annoyingly strict Korean mother who simply wants the best for Jenny, but in wanting to protect her daughter, cannot help but focus on the bad. On the other hand, Winter as Jenny’s father provides great comedic timing in several scenes and actively breaks down stressful situations earlier in the story. Nonetheless, Winter’s character slowly succumbs to the stress and anger of failing to protect his family after George destroys their legacy. However, in accepting the limits of their ability to control those around them, we come to understand that there was no villain in the story after all. 
Winter said the role, even when Jenny’s father came to his lowest point, still was “redeemable” in the end.
“We see in the show … how good intentions can lead to bad consequences,” Winter said. “It’s just that there are unfortunate circumstances and unfortunate consequences of their actions that make people lose their ability to choose.”
Nods to Korean culture are also present throughout the play, such as Jenny and her mom wearing a hanbok, a traditional Korean dress, during Jenny’s wedding, and the couple paying respects to Jenny’s parents during Korean New Year with ​​sebae, a bowing ritual done by the younger for their elders to bring luck and happiness into their lives. 
Opening night coincided with USC’s kickoff celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage month, and the production marks the first instance of an all-Asian cast in a USC student production. Ko said that this, along with the casting, made sure the story revolved around Asian culture.
“There are cultural elements that we did have to share with the cast who don’t share the same culture. But overall, it was a very mutually respectful environment, and I think we all learned a lot through that process,” Ko said.
The play encapsulates a type of immigrant experience that many Asian Americans can find comfort in, one that shows the nature of overbearing, controlling parents’ desire for their child’s success but disillusionment with their child’s happiness. Treiman spoke about writing parental roles into the production, noting previous stereotypes or even personal resentment that some may have against their own family for misunderstandings.
“[My parents] are people who are trying their hardest to understand me, much as I’m trying to understand them,” Treiman said. “It’s like, ‘I love my parents. I love my family.’ It’s just that some days, I’m like, ‘I wish you wouldn’t say that sometimes.’”
While centered around the Asian American experience, nearly everyone could relate to or empathize with this notion. We can all relate to the struggle of trying to discover our purpose in life.
Students, family members and theater enthusiasts alike all gasped at heart-wrenching one-liners and chatted between scenes, making the Massman feel more like a home than a theater. It felt as if the entire audience was your friend group, all sharing a particular anger when George burned down the family dry cleaner and joy when Jenny stood up for her true beliefs. It felt like we were all tied to one another through our mutual understanding that life is complicated and at the end of the day, we can only control ourselves. One roller coaster of emotional turmoil, “Bridge of Birds” makes you ponder who you are and who you come from.

After four long years, “Atlanta” finally made its glorious return to television about two weeks ago. As a huge Donald Glover fan, you can imagine that I’ve been waiting for this not-so-patiently.   
Season three was originally set to release in 2019 but was delayed due to scheduling conflicts. Then, like many other shows, “Atlanta” fell victim to the pandemic when production was halted in March 2020. Audiences, now left Paper Boi-starved, wondered where the European tour would take the characters.
I’m sure everyone is already aware of the impact the coronavirus had on the TV and film industry. Many different show and film releases were pushed back. Although “Atlanta” was delayed, at least Glover’s show didn’t meet the same fate as Netflix’s “The Society:” a show left on the ultimate cliffhanger, only to be canceled. It was originally renewed in 2019, but Netflix reversed the decision due to coronavirus-related circumstances. I personally thought the show had so much potential and was sad to see it go. But after seeing shows getting canceled left and right like this, I can’t complain about “Atlanta”’s delayed release.
FX debuted season three with two episodes: “Three Slaps” and “Sinterklaas is Coming to Town.” Admittedly, I did not watch them back to back, so I was left a little lost after watching the first episode. It wasn’t the return of Earn, Alfred, Darius and Van that I expected. In fact, the main cast wasn’t present at all. Earn only makes a short anti-climatic appearance at the very end due to how the entire episode seems to be set up as a dream of his. The first episode opens with a nightmare of two men fishing on an eerie lake, said to have once been the site of an entire town. The white fisherman discusses how white people are blinded to the pain they cause to the Black fisherman before he is dragged into the lake by a swarm of hands. Loquareeous, the main focus of the episode, wakes up from this, but the real nightmare has just begun.
The episode draws from the true story of the Hart family. In March 2018, Jennifer Hart and her wife Sarah drove an SUV off a cliff with their adopted children inside. Unlike the real tragedy, however, the main child Loquareeous returns back to his normal life and sees that the other children were rescued and survived.
“Three Slaps” serves as a perfect example of how the show experiments with crossing genres and straying away from dramedy and into horror. 
“I think funny and scary touch very much. We’ve always kind of been into dream logic because dreams always feel like something bad can happen, even when nothing bad happens,” said Glover at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour. 
This premiere kicked off what Glover described as a season about “the curse of whiteness,” particularly about the blind spots and ways white people are affected by racial issues. The show often deals with issues of race like this, and I think it was about time it truly confronts white ignorance. Throughout the past two seasons, discrimination and stereotypes set against the Black community challenged the show’s main characters. This season is expected to bring in an interesting take on racism from the white perspective. In the first episode alone, one of the adoptee’s parents cries over her inability to give the children a better life and says she thought they were doing the right thing.  
I started watching “Atlanta” because, truly, I am a sucker for Donald Glover. But I have to say, this is one of the only recent shows that I actually find worth keeping up with. It gives drama; it gives comedy; it gives a little bit of everything. Most importantly, it stays culturally relevant. 
It may be subtle, but “Atlanta” starts real conversations about social issues. And frankly, maybe my parents were right about the value of watching something educational that isn’t completely mindless. So if you’re looking for something of substance, turn on “Atlanta” and tap into the genius mind of Donald Glover.

The cool air of a crisp Saturday did not hinder fans from flooding into the Greek Theatre for the promise of serene sounds of opener Arlo Parks and headliner Clairo in the amphitheater setup. 
Donning everything from  Doc Martens to indie-esque long skirts to distressed tops, the best dressed — and most yassified — in Los Angeles were present at the theater awaiting the indie icon.
Before Clairo took the stage, Arlo Parks, a queer British songwriter who has made waves in the U.K. charts, hyped up the crowd with her upbeat sound and poetic lyricism that left me a fan. One of the most notable songs was “Caroline,” where her lyrics read “Strawberry cheeks flushed with defeated rage.” Considering Parks prides herself in also being a poet, sitting back, enjoying the music and swaying in a seat was the best circumstance to be in on Saturday night.
Following Parks, Clairo took the stage, starting off with a slow song that is fairly well-known, “Bambi.” This was followed by a couple of other slower tracks that kept the crowd content but eagerly awaiting a faster melody to get up and enjoy. 
Wishes were granted when the intro of “Bags” began to play, although it was unfortunately followed yet again with a pair of sad songs Clairo noted as being a patch in the setlist “we can get through together” as she spoke to the audience.
Ahead of any concert, almost every attendee follows the same routine of Googling the setlist and listening to an artist’s entire discography. But while at the concert, it was unclear if it was Clairo’s odd setlist or an unknowing crowd that made for an awkward time in the middle of the performance where everyone was just sitting, talking and enjoying the music; almost like background noise to a chill night. Unlike other concerts where fans scream at the top of their lungs to every song, the ambience of the crowd was more laid-back, leaving concert goers’ spirits unfulfilled.
For fans in the pit, every song was “shout at the top of your lungs” worthy, but it almost seemed like that wasn’t what this concert was supposed to be. Rather, Clairo seemed to have purposefully created a two-hour set of live music for an audience to passively consume. 
Back to the event, “Nomad,” a folksy, upbeat tune, definitely captured the attention of the crowd. Clairo boasted that this was particularly special to perform in L.A. since this was the only night she played in the city, especially considering how the coronavirus hindered tours from happening for the past few years. This, in conjunction with the fact that the song has yet to have a release date, made the crowd feel even more special upon hearing the unreleased track. The appeal of “Nomad” could surely reach non-listeners and leave new fans patiently awaiting its debut after getting a sneak peak of it with the L.A. crowd.
Prior to the concert, every fan was given a neon pink sticky note to place on their phone flashlights when the song “Blouse” came on. At first, some were confused at the task, but it was quite the sight to see the pink fluorescence across the audience and the swaying bodies of an entire theater at the dynamic duo of Parks and Clairo. The song quickly stood out as a fan favorite of the night. 
Of course, the concert could not have ended without Clairo’s two most-known songs — from TikTok and other social platforms — “Pretty Girl” and “Sofia.” 
Everyone anxiously stood up once the intro to “Pretty Girl” began, waiting to sing along and record the chorus to post on social media. With both songs being uplifting and fast paced, as well as fairly well-known, Clairo’s choice to sing them last was a great way to end the night on a high note. 
And the night can’t be rated without taking into consideration the sick saxophone solo in “Sofia” that left the crowd in awe. The use of instruments that are not usually present in concerts, like the saxophone and flute, was something so unique and engaging to see because listening to cool beats and instrumental hymns is what live music is all about. 
The overall concert had many ups and downs, with an equal amount of periods of slowed passive sounds to fast-paced, dance-worthy music.
It was a night to remember for many audience members, and an emotional night for Clairo, who teared up in awe and admitted to being a bit “overwhelmed” by the warm reception of the Angeleno crowd. Even if some audience members left knowing they will not return to an encore concert, attending at least one Clairo concert makes for a perfect check on a bucket list of memorable nights of great music and even more impeccable vibes.

FemFest, an annual counter-patriarchal music concert hosted by the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, made its mark on McCarthy Quad Saturday for the organization’s first in-person show since 2019. 
With an impressive lineup stacked with artists that truly reflected the goals of the organization — being queer, feminine and loud — FemFest showcased a wide variety of talent that made its return to campus all the more memorable. 
“Our goal every year for all of FemFest is to promote artist identities that are typically marginalized in the industry, so I think we did a pretty good job this year at that,” said Grace Szafara, a junior majoring in music industry who serves as the director of booking and hospitality. 
When doors opened at 4 p.m., entering students were met with clothing vendors, food trucks, women-empowerment organizations such as Gritty In Pink and sounds by DJ opener Girl Online who easily got the early crowd dancing. 
In line with the concerts’ overall theme of defying the patriarchy, assistant director of experience Bridget Bowen, a junior majoring in music industry, said the experience team made sure the booths at the show properly reflected its values. These included the nonprofit TACO, who handed out fentanyl testing strips, and She Is the Music, an organization building a community for women in the music industry. 
CARR, the only other artist besides the headliner, Dreamer Isioma, accompanied by a full band, was the first artist to take the stage and immediately captured the audience with her quick wit and comical stories about each of her songs. Her stage presence and calls to the crowd asking “Who likes to have sex in the shower?” and “Is anyone drunk?” certified the night as an empowering evening that refused to shy away from being provocative. 
“I’m just honored that people thought of me to do this because I obviously love women and I talk shit on men a lot,” said CARR said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “This feels like a safe space.” 
The following act, Tiffany Day, impressed the crowd with her incredible vocals and ability to make the stage her own. In addition to her more-than-enough strength in singing, Day showcased her skills on guitar and was supported by her drummer, Ross Murakami. Closing her set, “CALONE” was undoubtedly the audience’s favorite and served as a perfect segueway for the rest of the night as the sun set. 
The crowd only continued to grow throughout the evening, and after being introduced by her DJ Suga Shay, REI AMI strutted on stage with infectious confidence and was the perfect support for the headliner.  
For its openers, FemFest notably brought in smaller artists, two of which have less than 400,000 monthly listeners on Spotify who deserve recognition and a platform, and in doing so, introduced students to a new catalog of music.
“I saw Rei Ami, and I’ve never been exposed to her music before,” said Mai-Yen Fritz, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “But I love her music now, so I will be streaming it.”
The impressive openers were the perfect build up to the final act of the night. Dreamer Isioma, a R&B/pop artist from Chicago, performed an amazing headlining set that radiated with energy. In addition to “Sensitive,” their brash alt-R&B 2020 track that recently went viral on TikTok, Dreamer Isioma serenaded the crowd with “Stop Calling The Police On Me” and showed off their French skills with “Voulez-Vous Me To…” among others. 
Dreamer Isioma’s ability to get the audience moving to their music underscored their natural talent and the crowd, which was absolutely roaring with adoration, did not take it for granted. 
For the FemFest team, having the show come to fruition is a bittersweet moment. The planning process takes almost a year, and the level of dedication and commitment to the values of the organization are seemingly abundant. 
For Fenner Osmond-Friedman, director of production and a junior majoring in music industry, working on FemFest has been particularly rewarding as it’s necessary to recognize the work women do within music. 
“It is so important to me to be a part of organizations that are amplifying female voices, especially in the music industry,” Osmond-Friedman said. “There’s such a low percentage of women in production roles, so I feel really excited to be making that happen and maybe showing some other people that girls run this shit.” 
Beyond the music, FemFest proved the importance of creating a space dedicated to inclusivity and intersectionality. It was a night created by a team that believes in countering the patriarchy in any way it can and was enjoyed by an audience that believes in the same goal. 
“I think it’s really important to let everyone know any women-identifying people that they matter, their voices matter and that even though [Women’s History] month is over, their voices do not stop mattering,” Fritz said. “I think it’s also encouraging as a woman to see so many people here to celebrate and how many people really do believe that we can rule the world.”

USC lacrosse moved up to No. 13 in this week’s IWLCA poll after a huge 14-10 win over Michigan in Ann Arbor on Sunday. 
The Trojans’ win improves them to 3-0 all-time against the Wolverines. In addition, the non-conference win boosts USC’s resume and morale going into the second half of conference play this weekend. 
“We just want to get better each and every day, and we had an awesome opportunity against a really great Michigan team to come and battle,” said Head Coach Lindsey Munday in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We knew it was going to be an intense game, a physical game and our team really stepped up as a whole.”
The Wolverines picked up the first goal of the game within 20 seconds of the opening draw, grasping quick momentum in the first quarter. Michigan controlled the center circle on draw controls and ultimately won the first quarter, 4-3. 
However, as soon as the whistle blew for the second quarter, the Trojans took back control of the game, scoring four goals and holding a 7-5 lead going into halftime. 
Their 6-0 goal run continued into the third quarter. The Wolverines went scoreless for over 19 minutes as USC took an 11-5 lead in the fourth quarter. 
Munday credits several factors such as draw controls for the team’s run. 
Freshman midfielder Christina Gagnon fought in the center circle and led the team with five draw controls. Overall, the Trojans lost 18-10 in draw controls.  
Munday said that USC played a strong yet simple offensive game and defensively shut down Michigan. She mentioned that each player’s performance built off of each other, and “momentum like that … It can swing a game.”
The Trojans were led yet again by graduate midfielder Kelsey Huff. She not only posted her eighth hat trick of the season but also led all scorers on both teams with four goals on six shots. This performance put Huff into second place for USC’s all-time goals scored. 
Huff graduated from USC in 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and decided to come back and pursue a Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation while completing her final year of NCAA eligibility. Munday commended Huff’s choice to return.
 “[Huff] didn’t have to come back. She didn’t have to stay here at USC,” she said. “She made an intentional chance to come back and lead this team … to hopefully places we’ve never been before.” 
According to Munday, Huff’s experience, prowess and leadership have proven invaluable and continue to help as the team finishes up their season. 
“She’s not only phenomenal on the field but off the field as a leader, she’s just someone who can connect the group, who can push them not only with her leadership but with her play,” Munday said.
USC will return to conference play Friday at 4 p.m. for their second matchup against UC Berkeley on McAlister Field.

Now that March Madness is over, it’s naturally time to focus on football. 
Spring is a fun time to evaluate schools and their progression for the upcoming season. USC definitely has a lot of buzz around it with new Head Coach Lincoln Riley. Like I said, we should naturally be talking about how Riley’s been adjusting to life in Hollywood. 
I don’t want to though. It’s my column, hence the uncreative name “Anthony on LA” As you can tell from the headline of this column, I decided to, in fact, not focus on football. 
The headlines about Riley and sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams will run across publications in the next eight months. Their time is next by the time you finish reading this column. 
As always, I’ll shine a light on that basketball team that lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. I was wrong about them, which we discussed in an earlier January column. 
It was a classic Trojans loss — turnovers plus missed free throws with a sprinkle of scoring droughts to top it off. How this continues to happen is the topic of another column (Hint: There’s a consistent piece in it all).
The loss, though, turns the tide to the most important offseason of Head Coach Andy Enfield’s tenure. 
He’s rebuilt this program into college basketball relevancy. He’s revamped this program into a consistent conference contender. He’s retooled this program into a staple of the AP Top 25 rankings. 
Most importantly, Enfield has brought a name to a program that was, for the most part, nameless before him. Outside of some strong years in the late 2000s, USC basketball was hit or miss. Enfield’s made it more swish than brick. 
But now, the bar is set. 
If the Trojans don’t make the tournament each year Enfield is here, then the season should be deemed a failure. It’s as simple as that. If Enfield continues to stick up for the program by boasting their win total, the expectations surrounding them have to rise. 
Athletic Director Mike Bohn and the Athletic Department are clearly more invested in the Trojans too. It became clear when last month Enfield received an extension until the 2027-28 season. 
With two consecutive appearances in March Madness, Enfield can start a tradition with another run next season. He’s never made three straight trips to March Madness as a head coach, and if he wants the Trojans to earn respect across college basketball, doing so will help his case. 
The foundation is there. Two strong seasons are great to work off of. However, that formula will be put to the test this offseason. 
It’s simply the highest pressurized offseason of his career. 
Enfield had his chance to squeeze some love toward the program during the Clay Helton football era. He definitely did that with student section attendance records breaking twice this season. 
However, more eyes put more pressure on USC to live up to that. Fans are no longer satisfied with merely competing in the conference — they want March Madness runs, and consistent ones at that. 
It will be difficult to replicate that next year, forcing Enfield into his toughest coaching job yet. Familiar names will be gone from the Trojans rotation next season.
Junior guard Ethan Anderson and junior forward Max Agbonkpolo entered the transfer portal days after losing to Miami. Both were staples of Enfield’s rotation the previous two seasons. Anderson specifically had a role throughout his USC career, averaging at least 20 minutes per game all three years. 
Most importantly though, Anderson and Agbonkpolo are junior forward Isaiah Mobley’s closest friends on the team. Anderson even lives with Mobley. If those two are gone, it almost guarantees that Mobley is entering the NBA Draft, ending his Trojan tenure.
Enfield will have to find a replacement for Mobley’s immense production this season — he led the Trojans in points, rebounds and blocks per game while tying for the highest assists and steals per game. Each year Enfield had a Mobley on his team, USC won 20-plus games too. 
Maybe I’m going too far with that previous stat, but it’s obvious: Losing Mobley is a huge hit, especially since front-court players Chevez Goodwin and Isaiah White have used up their eligibility. 
Sophomore Boubacar Coulibaly also entered the transfer portal, leaving the Trojans with three returning forwards — freshman Harrison Hornery, freshman Kobe Johnson and redshirt sophomore Joshua Morgan. 
It is far from ideal, but senior guard Drew Peterson and junior guard Boogie Ellis returning is huge. A 2022 recruiting class ranked sixth in the nation that includes center Vince Iwuchukwu and Sierra Canyon forward Kijani Wright is massive. Enfield’s recruiting in recent years is exceptional. 
The rest of the roster, however, is still up in the air. A backup guard needs to be figured out. Someone has to step up as the star with Mobley gone. The transfer portal is always an option for Enfield to go fishing in.
But one thing is clear — Enfield’s got the tools he needs. He’s got support from the campus. He’s got Bohn behind him. And he’s got the nation shining a light on the program. 
Now the pressure’s on. Luckily for Enfield and the program, we’ll check back in November. Thank Lincoln Riley.

USC beach volleyball extended its winning streak to 18 duels after a dominant weekend in Manhattan Beach at the UCLA Invitational. The Trojans dropped just two sets in four duels and overcame three top-10 teams in the tournament. USC is now 19-1 on the season. 
The No. 3 Trojans played two matches on Saturday and two on Sunday at the Manhattan Beach Pier. Among USC, the other teams at the invitational were No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 TCU, No. 5 LMU, No. 6 LSU, No. 9 Hawaii, No. 15 FIU and Utah. 
After losing its second game of the season to the Bruins, USC has yet to drop a match. 
Head Coach Dain Blanton was pleased with how his team performed last weekend. 
“It was nice to finally see those teams,” said Blanton in a phone interview. “[It was] really great to see them and to perform the way that we did. The girls from the first spot all the way down to the fifth spot were ready to go.”
USC kicked off the tournament Saturday morning with a win against the Tigers. The Trojans dropped just one set to LSU, winning 4-1. USC’s dropped point came from court four after losing a three-set battle. The Trojans improved to 5-2 all-time against the Tigers.
USC’s second match of the tournament came Saturday afternoon against Hawaii. The Rainbow Wahine played in the Mapes Beach Invitational on Thursday prior to this weekend’s tournament, where they nearly upset the Horned Frogs in a 3-2 duel and were swept by UCLA 5-0. TheyIt beat the Panthers 3-2 in Manhattan Beach Saturday morning.
The Rainbow Wahine were no problem for the Trojans, as USC came away with a 5-0 sweep. In their first meeting since the 2019 NCAA Tournament, the Trojans won four of their matches in straight sets. 
On court three, however, sophomore Delaynie Maple and former Wahine graduate Julia Scoles fought to win a three-set duel. Maple and Scoles, despite dropping their 31-set win streak Saturday, are 20-0 this season following this weekend’s tournament.
USC built upon Saturday’s success with two wins on Sunday. The Trojans took down previously undefeated TCU and Florida International.
The Horned Frogs were 28-0 before their meeting with USC. After beating No. 1 UCLA twice — once on Thursday and once on Saturday — the Trojans delivered No. 2 TCU its first loss of the season on Sunday. 
USC won on courts one through four, and the Horned Frogs scored their single point in the duel with a win on court five. 
“Any time you beat good teams and any time you have a streak going, you try to build confidence,” Blanton said. 
The Trojans finished the weekend with a sweep over the Panthers. The win marked USC’s 12th sweep of the season.
Sophomore Megan Kraft and graduate Sammy Slater improved to 14-0 on the season. Senior Tina Graudina and graduate Hailey Harward picked up their 15th straight win. 
With the Pac-12 Beach Volleyball Championship just under a month away, the Trojans look to continue their success until the end of the season. They have just two more road tournaments and senior day at home against UCLA on April 22 before the tournament kicks off. 
“Our long-term strategy is to take every opportunity to get a little bit better,” Blanton said. “I think we’re doing that right now.”
The Trojans will head north this weekend for the Pac-12 North Invitational at Stanford Beach Volleyball Stadium. USC will compete in four duels, three of them against nationally-ranked opponents — No. 8 Stanford and No. 13 California on Saturday and No. 17 Arizona and Oregon on Sunday.

If money wasn’t a barrier for me to pursue any occupation in this world, I would drop everything to become a park ranger. I don’t mention that just so that I can insert myself into this article for my own vanity. Living and working in nature, away from the bustle and business of a world sometimes seemingly hellbent on keeping us behind desks in tall buildings, is a dream.
That’s why I miss living in the South: Nature, in the form of tall trees and canopies, covered my hometown. When I would fly back to Georgia, I knew I wasn’t in San Jose anymore when I would look out the airplane window to see a blanket of green surrounding skyscrapers and city centers. 
However, national and state parks, as well as any other protected pockets of nature, are being threatened by commercialization. One such threat has struck the very heart of Appalachia. The West Virginia House of Delegates recently voted 77-20 to advance House Bill 4408, a bill that would allow the state’s Division of Natural Resources to enter into contracts with third parties in order to support facilities at state parks and forests. This effectively opens the door to a wide range of establishment: Casinos, tourist attractions and gimmicky lodgings. What this bill does, above all else, is reintroduce the idea of privatizing what is supposed to be a resource meant for all to enjoy.
Talks of privatizing national or state parks is hardly anything new. In 2019 under the Trump Administration, the Department of the Interior’s committee of recreation industry big-wigs released a proposal that would limit senior discounts for park entry, privatize campgrounds and enable Wi-Fi and Amazon deliveries to be made. Thankfully, that proposal and the committee was shuttered. Like West Virginia’s most recent move to hang some neon signs over a few hundred acres of pristine natural beauty, this move to privatize public parks and forests is motivated by the indisputable fact that maintenance of these pockets of nature is a sunk cost. 
Like all government-owned and operated things, sunk costs are not worth getting rid of purely because they are sunk costs. Take the USPS for example. The USPS’s sole function is to serve the public. It does not discriminate where it adds new addresses or extends its services based solely on the gross income of a certain area or of a singular resident. Yet, year after year it incurs losses. 
In 2009 alone, the USPS reported $3.8 billion in losses. When the agency put in measures to reduce those losses, however, they put thousands out of well-paying jobs. Similarly, national and state parks and forests serve the purpose of protecting and maintaining nature so that all people can enjoy it. Yet, national parks in particular are burdened with a slim part of the overall budget and a nearly $12 billion maintenance backlog. Neither of these institutions has escaped threats of privatization, but the threat to nature parks and forests is much more severe for a great variety of people. 
National and state parks — as with most, if not all, of the land in this country — belonged to Indigenous peoples. Our national parks are pristine carvings out of stolen land. The Indigenous communities that existed long before the creation of the United States were, and continue to be, stewards of these lands. The National Park Service, doing the bare minimum, allows Indigenous folks to enter all parks for free. Privatization then carries with it the most heinous threat of becoming a barrier of entry for the stewards and protectors of America’s best idea.
The general public won’t just be burdened by possibly higher costs of entry. Companies and industries who choose to put their business in, say, a West Virginia state park, won’t stop at the construction of a tourist attraction or two. They’ll build things that they’ll think visitors would like and pollute the land they use in the process. In a state, and a region, with a history of corporations taking advantage of it — for example, coal which needs no introduction — this kind of move just welcomes more greedy businesses to tread where they really shouldn’t. 
West Virginia is the last state in need of more corporations and companies coming to the state only to seek a profit. The last thing the state’s precious parks and forests need are polluters looking to use their natural beauty as a marketing gimmick.
In the future, what’s to say that these recreation companies won’t jump ship once they start wondering whether or not they’re making a good profit or not? America’s greatest ideas don’t need to be run like a business — they ought to be run like public goods.

Content warning: This article contains references to suicide and struggling with mental health.
As of October 2021, there were roughly 430 million monthly active users in the world calling Reddit home. The USC subgroup itself has over 25,000 members and last week, as I logged on at 10:56 a.m. Friday morning, 151 Trojans were actively online. 
What is Reddit? For those who aren’t familiar, it is a massive collection of forums where people share news and content while responding to others. However, it is so much more than that. Reddit is a place where people seek answers and is also a place where people seek companionship, comfort and solace — the ultimate college friend. 
Sometimes you just need input on a class, so you type in a course number and several discussions pop up, mentioning teachers, assignments and workloads — the honest truth about a class that a counselor wouldn’t share with you or that you couldn’t find on Rate My Professors.  
Students will ask about social life, promote upcoming events and find the best local bars and clubs. It is for students, by students, providing the advice of lived experiences, rather than a Yelp Top 10 list. 
Every single day, hundreds of posts enter the USC forum. Pool tables around campus? Has anyone caught an Aerodactyl on campus on Pokémon GO? Looking for a dining hall buddy?
Reddit has crafted its reputation around being a helping hand. Beyond academic resources or questions about events, it has become an avenue for creating connections, whether that be people seeking new friends, class recommendations, someone to go to the gym with or someone to explore the city with — it’s all been done on Reddit. There are so many people seeking relationships and connections, and when it feels impossible, one turn to Reddit will prove you wrong. 
However, Reddit goes even deeper than that. Earlier this month on March 15, a student made a post captioned, “im so worthless.” The post was short, emphasizing that they are not meaningful and no one would care if they were gone. The comment sections were filled with messages of support, resources and those relating to the struggles of being a USC student.
On March 23, a week later, the same student posted a follow-up, writing that they are still a student at USC and have been in therapy for months. Additionally, the student shared that after writing that post, they had tried to take their own life, detailing the experience and the support they received from friends and family during recovery. The end of the post reflected on the original post. 
“I’m going back through all those comments again, and it took me now to realize: no one would be telling me any of these things if I hadn’t given them a reason to. They see something in me that I don’t,” wrote the user. “I now realize, everyone that commented on my first post, you were all right.”
This student was one of many who have come forward, detailing the more painful sides of their experience at USC. As a student, it can be so easy to struggle at the hands of social and academic pressures, combined with the individual pressures one may have or be defined by. There are so many shared experiences shared by the student community of our school, yet it can be so easy to feel that you are alone in your challenges. 
Reddit has done something that no other social media platform has harnessed — it reminds students that no matter what, they’re not alone in their experiences. While every other social media platform is defined by creating one’s presence, brand or putting their best foot forward in hopes of creating a positive reputation, Reddit is defined by anonymity. It allows students to have the conversations they need to, while forgoing feelings of embarrassment or anxiety about how it may be perceived by others. 
College is a confusing world. Navigating moving away from home, finding new friends, dealing with the pressure of grades, extracurriculars and expectations while navigating your own mental health challenges is nothing but difficult — something nearly all college students can testify to. Reddit is by no means a replacement for a therapist or real-world connections, but it is a strong guiding force that provides unique support to college students unlike any other platform. 
Reddit is the ultimate platform for finding solace while navigating the world of college. Whether you need advice for traveling to Santa Monica or details on how to get the mental health help you need, it is all there.
