The other day, I noticed an odd amount of carrots in my refrigerator and decided to do something with them. Normally I would make carrot cake, but given the fact that I gave up sweets for lent, carrot cake was not an option.

Instead, I recalled a warm ginger carrot soup I’d had before but remembered thinking that it would be just as good chilled. I started looking around for some delicious chilled soup recipes and found a slew of ginger carrot soup recipes, but one stood out to me the most, a recipe by my favorite grocery store, Whole Foods Market.
This recipe is great because it uses eight simple ingredients, is vegan, fat free, high in fiber and sugar conscious – in other words, perfect. Additionally, ginger is a great immunity booster and when tasting this soup, you can really taste the ginger’s healing powers at work as you inhale the gingery fumes and feel the flavor engulf your throat and nostrils.
I am a huge fan of carrot ginger soup, but that doesn’t stop me from trying other types of soup. I recently made a tomato soup that tasted more like a Spanish Gazpacho than the classic Campbell’s Tomato soup. I tend to go for the savory over the sweet, but if you want a sweet cold soup, there are plenty cold soups with fruity flavors.
My search led me to a New York Times list of “12 Cold Soup Recipes.” The list divides the recipes into four, important soup categories: smooth, chunky, creamy and sweet. Normally, I’m a chunky soup girl, but the sweet section definitely caught my eye – I mean, come on, they have pineapple soup.
Smooth soups are great, but they often bring back nostalgia of my infant days – in other words, hello baby food.
The chunky soups are great, especially because watermelon gazpacho is included.
With that, I dare say that college students should get more creative and eat more soup? Soup is good for most any time of the day and is very tasty. All college students really need are a blender and a few random ingredients to create something spectacular. If you’re not a fan of making your own food and want to try a great place with the what LA Weekly calls “best soup in all of Los Angeles,” head over to Little Next Door and try their French Onion soup – it’s a good thirty minute drive with traffic to get there from USC, but in my opinion, it’s worth the trip.

With the Spring season finally in swing, box office releases are beginning to roll out at a much higher rate. This weekend will have three major releases, all catering to different types of demographics. The main question is can any topple the behemoth that is Captain America: Winter Soldier?
Rio 2 is the follow up to Rio, a 2011 film about a Macaw from small town Minnesota who travels to Rio de Janeiro. 2014 has seen a string of strong family films, including The Lego Movie, Mr. Peabody & Sherman and, most recently, Muppets Most Wanted. The film’s mixed reviews and the saturation of the market for family films could spell trouble for Rio 2, but its star-studded cast, including Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway, and fans of the first film could mean that it still gets a decent showing at the box office.
Kevin Costner is back with yet another sports movie. Draft Day focuses on the behind-the-scenes action that comes with each pro sports draft, something that most people might not be aware of. Costner is something of a sports film icon, known most notably for sports films like Field of Dreams and Bull Durham. The film should be popular for Costner fans and the fantasy sports types, but should not be able to reach out to a wider audience.
Oculus is a horror flick that looks to target anyone looking for a different kind of movie this weekend. The film has received strong reviews and looks poised to make a move into future sequels. It centers more on the supernatural and dread rather than pure gore, which could appeal to a wider audience. Generally, horror movies aren’t particularly strong in the box office, but Oculus should fare well.
Coming off a record-setting weekend, Captain America: Winter Soldier isn’t going anywhere. It will still claim the top spot by a landslide, and the new releases should fall in place afterwards.

Students gathered to discuss the current climate of race, class and social structure in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Thursday night with USC alumnus and award-winning director John Singleton. Prior to the discussion, students screened John Singleton’s 1995 film Higher Learning, a movie focused on the personal and social progression of a group of diverse students during their first year of college.
Approximately 60 students were in the room for the event hosted by the Beta Omega Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.
Levi Powell, vice president of the Beta Omega Chapter of Kappa Psi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., said that they held the screening because the movie reflected some racially charged events that took place in the past school year.
Throughout the conversation, many participants referred to the May 4 incident when more than 79 Los Angeles Police Department officers broke up a student party where attended by mostly black and Latino students. The incident led to the social movement among students that became the USChangeMovement.
John Singleton acknowledged the similarities between the recent events on campus and the 19-year-old movie. Singleton also said the movie looked at the core issues that lead to these familiar incidents.
“What I liked about this film is that it dealt with alienation,” John Singleton. “This wasn’t a dig on USC, but it could have been any university anywhere.”
During the discussion many students spoke about their experiences with incidents of racial profiling on and around campus, not only by the LAPD but also by the Dept. of Public Safety.
USC Professor of Law Jody Armour, who moderated a forum following the May 4 incident and another panelists in the discussion, responded to students, acknowledging the ongoing concerns.
“These issues are perennial,” Armour said. “It’s a very embarrassing and uncomfortable reality. You have honest people who are being discriminators.”
Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry was in graduate school when Higher Learning first came out and said he felt like he could relate to it.
“These issues mattered,” Carry said. “Every single issue in that movie could have been in 2014. These issues have existed for a very long time. We have to start fixing and healing by these conversations.”
Students — some who were born the year the movie was released — said they were impacted by the movie’s timeliness and reliability.
“The movie was powerful in its ability to be relatable to everybody,” Kemdah Stroud, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, “but sadly it’s very representative of my experience at USC in regards to isolation and discrimination.”
Ryan Cole, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, agreed that the film reflected some of his experiences on campus but that much progress has been and is being made.
“A lot of racial prejudices and stereotypes still hinder the forward progress of the student community at this university,” Cole said. “However, I do feel that the student body is active in trying to do all they can to make things better.”
Singleton is currently working on a movie about the late rapper Tupac and activist Assata Shakur.
