Former surfing executive Jeffrey Bizzack was sentenced to two months in prison Wednesday after paying $250,000 in Fall 2017 to have his son admitted to USC by falsely designating him as a volleyball recruit.
He will also have to pay a $250,000 fine, perform 300 hours of community service and face three years of supervised release.
Bizzack pleaded guilty July 24 to  one count of conspiracy to commit wire mail fraud and honest services mail fraud after paying a total of $250,000 in exchange for the admission of his son, who allegedly had no knowledge of the scheme. 
Of the money Bizzack paid, $50,000 was paid directly to USC’s Galen Center, while the remaining $200,000 was paid under the guise of a donation to the Key Worldwide Foundation, a fraudulent nonprofit created by the admissions scheme leader William “Rick” Singer. 
Singer, who pleaded guilty to four charges associated with the scandal in March, used the money to pay monthly installments to former USC senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, according to the Los Angeles Times. Heinel was fired from her position in March following the discovery of her role in the scandal and currently faces five charges in connection with the scandal.
Singer also conspired with former USC assistant soccer coach Laura Janke, who faces one charge of conspiracy to commit racketeering, to create a fake athletic profile for Bizzack’s son that presented him as a star volleyball player. Heinel then presented the applicant, designated as a men’s volleyball recruit, to an admissions committee, which granted him conditional acceptance. Bizzack’s son was formally admitted to the University in March 2018.
Bizzack’s attorneys originally argued that because Bizzack contacted federal officials with information about his connection to the scandal upon learning about the scheme’s uncovering, he should be given a comparatively light sentence of probation and community service only. 
In June, Bizzack became the first defendant charged in the case since the case was made public in March. He was the 51st person charged and is the 13th to be sentenced in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal. His $250,000 fine is the largest to date in the admissions scandal.
Bizzack’s sentencing marks the fourth for a USC parent in the college admissions case. Of the 33 parents named in the case, 16 are USC parents. 
The sentencing comes after those of USC parents Jane Buckingham and Agustin Huneeus Jr. earlier this month and Devin Sloane in September. Huneeus was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services wire mail fraud and was sentenced to five months in prison, two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and a fine of $100,000.
Buckingham and Sloane, also charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, received comparatively lighter penalties. Buckingham was sentenced to three weeks in prison, one year of supervised release and a $40,000 fine. Sloane was sentenced to four months in prison, two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and a $95,000 fine.

Nearly 150 USC community members filled the pews of Our Savior Parish Wednesday evening to honor a student who died Sunday.
The student, John Moore, was a senior majoring in cinematic arts and television production at the School of Cinematic Arts. 
The Catholic vigil and mass opened with several prayers and hymns, followed by a welcoming from the Rev. Richard Sunwoo. Sunwoo spoke to Moore’s dedication to the world of cinema.
“Movies speak so well to the human connection,” Sunwoo said. “We’ve seen so much loss and tragedy in recent weeks.” 
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni gave a brief speech and asked students to take a moment of silence for Moore. 
“John lived a good life, and he was deeply loved here at USC, deeply, deeply loved,” Soni said. “I didn’t have the great privilege of knowing him, but over the last several days, I’ve taken great comfort in stories that I’ve heard about how beloved he was on our campus.”
Soni spoke to how tight-knit the SCA community is and how valuable that can be in times of distress.
“To the students of the School of Cinematic Arts, in my 12 years at USC I have yet to meet a closer group of students on campus than you,” Soni said. “Through your coursework, through your curriculum, through your production work, you spend so much time together in your cohort communities. You work days and nights and weekends together … Please continue to lean on each other.”
Soni emphasized the importance of communal support at the end of his speech.
Since August, there have been at least five student deaths. 
“I want all of you here to know that you are loved, that you are seen, that you are heard, that you matter, that you belong, that you are not alone,” he said.
Dave O’Brien, one of Moore’s former production professors, remarked on John’s wit and intellect in the classroom.
“From his love of classic rock to his uncanny ability to drop film and cultural references, his deep appreciation for cinema made John a memorable student and friend,” he said.
Belton McMurray, John’s best friend and freshman-year roommate, recounted emotionally how close he and John became when they met at a summer program their junior year of high school before attending USC. It was obvious that they were each other’s choice roommates, and McMurray said they quickly “became brothers.”
“One thing that we made sure to be was there for each other,” McMurray said. “When, two years ago, my little sister called me and told me that my actual brother had died, the first person — I’m not making this up — the very first person who called me was John Moore.”
Moore’s two older brothers, Patrick and Bobby, closed the vigil by speaking about their memories of John and how much he made them laugh. Bobby shared a story of how their family had attended mass in their hometown of Bodega, Calif., several years ago in St. Teresa of Avila Church where Alfred Hitchock’s “Birds” was filmed.
“There was a bat that was flying all around, and John and I were just watching it, and this bat swooped down,” Bobby said.
In the completely silent church, John let out a yelp. Even through tears, those that attended the mass couldn’t hold back laughter.
“I just want to let you all know that we are all here for you now, too,” Patrick said. “So please, anything that you want to say, anything that you want to come to us and speak about, we will be here.”
Moore’s brothers spoke of how much films mattered to John and of his cinematic dreams for the future.
“John was also a good writer,” Bobby said. “Pat’s going to be finishing the script that they were working on.”

Actor Elizabeth Banks spoke about her experience as a female director during an early screening of her upcoming film Charlie’s Angels at Wallis Annenberg Hall Wednesday. Stacy Smith, director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, moderated the discussion. 
Banks said she dreamt about the movie, which is set to premiere Nov. 15, pitched it and ultimately wrote the screenplay. 
“The writing came after we went through a couple drafts and really there was a key moment where all the writers we were working with were men,” Banks said. “These guys came in and they just weren’t getting it, like the tone I was going for.”
She wrote a draft after that, which served as the main backbone for the movie. 
Banks said she had been interested in directing at an early age and even directed plays in college. However, she was frustrated that there were not many opportunities for women working off-screen.
“There was just not as much going on for women,” Banks said. “I thought I either have to believe that I am not as good at this job as [male actors] are, or I have to recognize that the system is against me. I chose the system.”
The experience led Banks to direct several projects, and she co-founded Brownstone Productions and made her big-screen directorial debut with “Pitch Perfect 2.” 
She believes that changes are taking place in Hollywood, but she said all industries need to address problems that prevent women from taking on leadership roles in different industries.  
“This is something that we all have to be talking about and thinking about now,” Banks said. “In Hollywood, we have the spotlight on us, and it’s especially important because we help create culture, and we help create the culture that creates the system that keeps women out of power.” 
She explained that during a conversation with fellow director Jay Roach, Roach acknowledged how the caregiving role placed on women to look after and take off from work to help family members.
“He was the first man in the industry that I had been speaking to about directing who acknowledged this to me,” Banks said. “He said, ‘I have never had to think about  — because I have a wife who takes care of my children, I have never had to think about about leaving town … because my family is taken care of, and I know that will not be the same for you.’”
Sydney Loew, a sophomore in the Iovine and Young Academy, said she enjoyed hearing Banks’ advice about the entertainment industry.
“I thought Elizabeth Banks had amazing advice for people entering the entertainment industry and she’s really cool,” Lowe said. “In her movies, she’s such a charismatic character, she always plays these quirky, fun people and in life she is quirky and fun, which just made the event awesome.”

USC men’s golf finished out its fall season in disappointing fashion with a last place performance at the Cypress Point Classic in Pebble Beach, Calif., Monday and Tuesday. The Trojans fell in all three of their matchups against No. 9 Stanford, No. 21 Alabama and No. 16 Cal.
The Cypress Point Classic is a bracket-style tournament similar to the Ryder Cup with championship and consolation routes determined by Monday’s opening fourball round. The eight teams were pre-seeded, and each team was split into three pairs for head-to-head competition. In each match, 4 points were assigned according to who won the front nine, the back nine and the overall match.
In the opening round, No. 5 seed USC played against host No. 4 Stanford for a berth in the championship bracket. The pair of sophomore Cameron Henry and junior Leon D’Souza tied Stanford sophomore Ethan Ng and junior Nate Menon, while senior Kyle Suppa and junior Issei Tanabe followed suit by matching their opponents’ score. Stanford senior David Snyder and freshman Barclay Brown snagged the match at 2-1, getting the edge over USC’s last pair, junior Kaito Onishi and freshman Yuxin Lin. 
The loss by Onishi and Lin was a departure from their usual standout tournament performances. The All-American Onishi was coming off a third-place finish at the Golf Club of Georgia Collegiate, while Lin won the major Asia-Pacific Amateur title at the end of September to earn berths in the 2019 Masters and Open Championships.
The pair recovered for the next Monday match against No. 8 seed Alabama, securing the Trojans’ only pair win for the tournament over Alabama’s junior Wilson Furr and freshman Simms Abney. Henry and D’Souza fell 3&2 in their round, and Alabama also defeated Tanabe and Suppa to claim the match 2-1 overall.
“I don’t think we necessarily had a real sound, strong week through and through,” head coach Chris Zambri said. “I know there were moments of good golf, but overall, I don’t think anyone necessarily had their best week. The matches were close, but in the end it comes down to winning and losing, and we just did not win clearly enough throughout the week.”
No. 7 seed Cal ran away with the seventh place match in Tuesday’s singles match play. Only Onishi tied his opponent; Henry and Suppa fell in 1up, Lin lost in 2up and Tanabe and D’Souza were defeated 2&1 and 5&4, respectively. Alabama finished with 5.5 points, while USC’s one tie led to a team total of 0.5.
No. 2 seed Georgia Tech won the overall tournament in a 5-1 match win over No. 1 Duke in the championship match. No. 3 UCLA captured the third place spot on the podium over Stanford, and No. 6 Illinois beat out Alabama for fifth.
Set in both the coastal dunes and Del Monte forest, the par-72 Cypress Point is consistently rated as one of the greatest challenging golf courses ever designed. Competing on this golf course as a collegiate player is a prestigious opportunity, with six of the participating teams ranked among Golfstat’s top 30 teams in the nation. 
At No. 40 in the country, USC currently does not hold a spot on this list. The GCAA has yet to release its rankings going into the second half of the year, but USC is likely to fall from its starting position at No. 11 with no team podium placements thus far. 
Team action picks up again at the end of January with the Southwestern Invitational in Westlake Village, Calif. In their time off, the Trojans will have the chance to reflect on both their team finishes and the productivity of their standout players.
“Obviously, the results were not what we wanted, but we’ve got the majority of our season left to play,” Zambri said. “There’s definitely some good among some of the stuff that didn’t go quite as well in the first semester, so hopefully we’ll focus on that and just make sure we’re ready come spring.”
It is yet to be seen if newcomers Yuxin and D’Souza will continue to prove their value to the team and if Onishi will provide the leadership and course command lost with the absence of now-pro Justin Suh.
If the Trojans still have their eyes set on an NCAA title this year, they must work toward more team tournament placements alongside top individual finishes in the second half of the season.

With songs like “La Llorona” and “Remember Me” blaring in front of Leavey Library, students and faculty sipped on warm champurrado and indulged in pan dulce while attending the Día de los Muertos event Wednesday.
The event — hosted in partnership with USC Libraries, the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures, La CASA and Latinx Greek organizations Omega Phi Beta and Sigma Delta Alpha — featured work from Mexican printmaker Jose Guadalupe Posada who created calaveras, or illustrations of skulls and skeletons associated with Day of the Dead that influenced iconic artists like Diego Rivera. The original materials can be accessed through USC Libraries and are available to all USC students and faculty. 
Consuelo Sigüenza-Ortiz, a Spanish-language professor, explained the history of Día de los Muertos in Latin America and how Posada influenced how we know the holiday today. 
“What’s happened in Latin America, specifically Mexico, the indigenous cultural traditions and religion have carried over into Catholicism … so that both cultures — the indigenous and the European Catholicism — believed in an afterlife,” she explained. “And so this is a way of honoring the dead. Now, the tradition of the skeletons comes from the use of Posada images.” 
Karen Howell, head of Leavey Library, said that this is the fourth annual Día de los Muertos event and that each year the event seems to grow in student engagement.
“Each year I’m really excited that more and more people are actually starting to recognize … It means to me that we’re becoming a more inclusive environment on campus,” Howell said. “I’m really hoping that this is a way for people to explore more about what the libraries can do to enrich their lives and your understanding, as well as know more about their fellow students.”
Sigüenza-Ortiz said that she thinks this event created appreciation and respect for the culture and informs students who are inclined to learn more. 
“I’m very pleased with the turnout, and the USC students are so curious and intelligent in terms of their questions and wanting to get at the reasoning behind this, but also they’re getting into the spirit of it not just in an academic way, but also in a very, very human way,” she said. “They’re partaking [in] the food, the champurrado, they’re vibing it and they’re being open, open to differences in cultures.”
Omega Phi Beta had a stand for students to create a portion of a barrilete gigante, or giant kites that range from 10 to 12 feet tall, which is an indigenous practice in Guatemala to connect with ancestors during the holiday. The sorority hoped to highlight different cultural traditions besides what most people typically associate with Día de los Muertos in Mexican culture. 
“We definitely wanted to expand people’s idea of what Día de los Muertos is with the commercialization of Día de los Muertos with ‘Coco,’” said Karen Garcia, a 2019 alumna and member of Omega Phi Beta. “I think it’s really important to recognize that Día de los Muertos looks different in different countries. And it’s still important to highlight all the different practices and traditions that happen.”
“[It] puts in perspective to other students that there are other cultures, and it’s actually amazing to find out what each culture does,” added Sergio Lopez, a member of Sigma Delta Alpha. “Even though it’s one, same event … each country does it differently and that’s kind of a spectacular thing to realize.”
Howell added that as a Chinese American, she did not know anything about the cultural holiday before she started researching. Now she wishes to inform USC students and remove the stigmas associated with the holiday’s symbols.
“They think it’s scary. When they hear about skulls and altars, they just kind of think like, ‘Oh, this is kind of weird.’ And so when I learned more about I thought, ‘No, I want to bring it out to people. I don’t want them to think this is weird,’” Howell said. “When people are enlightened, they understand the richness of that — it’s not like we have to be scared about something we don’t know about.”
The Día de los Muertos event continues on Oct. 31 from 1 to 4 p.m. by the Leavey Library Reflection Pool.

From former Rose Bowl MVP Sam Darnold to former Biletnikoff award candidate JuJu Smith-Schuster, there is no shortage of Trojan talent in the NFL this season. Not only are  these USC alumni great players, but they are explosive, exciting athletes who genuinely make the game more entertaining. Here’s how these Trojan alumni have stacked up through the first eight weeks of NFL competition.
Sam Darnold
The Jets’ second-year quarterback Sam Darnold headlines a group of USC alumni that hoped to break out in their second season. Darnold entered the season with high expectations due to the improved core around him, namely star running back Le’Veon Bell and new offensive-minded head coach Adam Gase.
The season has turned out to be a big question mark for Darnold thus far, as he has already suffered  three injuries. Perhaps most unfortunate, Darnold suffered from strep throat and mononucleosis before his Week 2 contest against the Cleveland Browns and was out through Week 5 due to an enlarged spleen. 
Darnold came back strong for Week 6, leading the Jets to their first and only win of the season over the Dallas Cowboys while putting up over 300 yards and two touchdowns. The next two games were a different story, however. 
Against the New England Patriots, Darnold could barely complete a pass, and his poor performance was further underscored by the fact that the TV crew picked him up saying he was “seeing ghosts” in the game. Darnold’s play was similarly poor Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He threw for just 218 yards and three interceptions, emerging from the game with a sprained thumb.
It’s probably too early to grade Darnold’s performance this season given that he’s missed half of it, but if he can play like he did against the Cowboys, he’ll have a bright future.
JuJu Smith-Schuster
Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster matches his big personality with his on-the-field play. A big-bodied receiver, Smith-Schuster uses his strength to bully defenders and come down with physical catches. Coming off a 1,400-yard receiving year and the departure of Antonio Brown, Smith-Schuster appeared to be poised for another productive year. 
However, after quarterback Ben Roethlisberger suffered a season-ending elbow injury in Week 1, Smith-Schuster’s production fell off a cliff. With just 443 yards and three touchdowns in seven starts, it’s been a bit of a down year for the typically-dominant USC product.
Leonard Williams
Former Jets defensive end Leonard Williams will now play for MetLife Stadium’s other tenant, the New York Giants. Williams was traded to the Giants Monday in exchange for a 2020 third-round pick and a 2021 fifth-round pick.
The former Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year was listed as a first-team alternate for the 2017 Pro Bowl but has not lived up to his draft hype since then. Williams has recorded just eight solo tackles through the first seven contests of 2019, but he’ll hope to experience better luck with the 2-6 Giants than he did with the 1-6 Jets in a new chapter of his football career.
Ronald Jones II
Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Ronald Jones II has been a pleasant surprise this season. After failing to even crack the gameday 46-man roster, Jones was a healthy scratch in multiple games last season despite being a second round pick.
While it seemed as though Jones was just a quick-to-accelerate speed back who didn’t pan out, the terrible competition in the Buccaneers backfield finally allowed him to get touches. 
Jones leads the team in rushing yards this season at 314 while averaging 4.2 yards per carry, a healthy improvement from the abysmal 1.9 mark he had last year. Anything would be an improvement from Jones’ play in 2018, which could be attributed to  a new approach. 
Head coach Bruce Arians is an offensive mastermind who should allow Jones to further develop the talent he flashed during his time at USC.
Devon Kennard
2009 John McKay Award winner Devon Kennard has been a dominant presence for the Detroit Lions this season as the team looks to remain competitive within the NFC North. The former fifth-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft has three sacks this season and is tied for fourth among linebackers with two fumble recoveries, including one that was returned for a touchdown in the Lions’ last game. Although Detroit’s playoff hopes are slim in a competitive division, Kennard could be bound for a Pro Bowl if he continues his impressive play this season.

After dropping two of its last three games, the No. 11 USC women’s soccer team is looking to get back on track this week when it travels north to take on the Oregon Ducks and Oregon State Beavers. 
The Trojans dropped four spots in the national poll this week after being shut out 2-0 by unranked Washington Sunday at home. The loss marked USC’s first scoreless game at home this season.
Although the Ducks and Beavers have a combined three wins in Pac-12 play this season, USC has struggled in the past with playing at the top of its game against weaker opponents. In Pac-12 losses to Cal and Washington, head coach Keidane McAlpine has echoed the team’s lack of competitiveness and intensity. 
“I’m looking to improve our focus, our intensity, our desire to win – those things, I think, trumped everything else today,” McAlpine said after the loss to Washington. 
History will be on the Trojans’ side when they travel to Oregon. USC has won its last six matches against the Ducks, including a 5-0 win last year. USC has enjoyed similar luck against Oregon State. The Trojans have won their last five matchups against the Beavers and beat Oregon State 5-0 last season. 
With three league losses, USC has now lost more conference games this season than any other season since 2014. Considering USC ranked as high as No. 2 in the preseason, the team will undoubtedly be looking for revenge in its the next couple games. 
Oregon and Oregon State may be in the bottom half of the Pac-12 standings, but the Trojans know how good Pac-12 is through and through. 
According to McAlpine, last weekend served as a reminder that no matter the ranking, any team can beat any other in league play. 
“It’s one of those games that reminds you how good our league is,” McAlpine told USC Athletics. “Our league is phenomenal this year. Our league has some great coaches, a lot of great talent, and if they don’t bring the proper level of energy and intensity and focus to the game, then it’s gonna be a long day.”
With only three games left in Pac-12 play before the NCAA Tournament, the Trojans will need another dominant weekend in order to have momentum when they visit Westwood to face UCLA next weekend. 
When USC faces the Ducks, it will have to keep its attention on Oregon sophomore star forward Jordan Wormdahl. Wormdahl leads the Ducks with seven goals on the season.
The Trojans have struggled keeping stars out of the back of the net this season. Redshirt junior goalie Kaylie Collins has posted three shutouts this season and hopes to return to Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year form after only recently returning to the field from injury. USC will rely on Collins to shut down Wormdahl on Thursday. 
Along with Collins, McAlpine will rely on USC’s two star forwards, junior Tara McKeown and sophomore Penelope Hawking, to put pressure on Oregon’s defense. The duo has scored 29 of the team’s 33 goals and accounted for 59 of USC’s 97 total points. 
USC faces Oregon Thursday night at 7 at Pape Field in Eugene.

When I was growing up, my mom would take me to GameStop every July for the midnight release of NCAA Football on PlayStation. When the release date rolled around, I’d get more excited for that than for my own birthday. 
Theoretically, I could have waited until the next day to buy NCAA. But that would have meant spending 12 fewer hours playing the greatest sports game ever conceived. So every year at midnight, I would unwrap the plastic packaging, pop in the shimmering compact disc and play until my avatar won the Heisman or my body forced itself into slumber, the sounds of fight songs still blasting through my speakers.
Now the game that defined so much of my childhood could be coming back … in a few years. On Tuesday, the NCAA Board of Governors voted to let student-athletes be compensated for their name, likeness and image. The new rules are expected to go into effect in January 2021, allowing enough time for each division to adjust to the changes. 
The sudden and shocking shift in the NCAA’s stance on amateurism was likely prompted by California passing the Fair Pay to Play Act, which granted NCAA athletes the right to profit from endorsement deals as soon as 2023. Fearing a stalemate with California and Florida, which is mulling its own bill, the NCAA relented. 
The NCAA Football series was discontinued in 2013 — a result of former UCLA basketball player Charles O’Bannon’s lawsuit against the NCAA. The NCAA wouldn’t allow players to be paid for appearing in the game, and schools feared more lawsuits if they continued making licensing agreements with EA Sports. As a result, the game faded away.
All of this is a long winded way of saying this: the NCAA’s change of heart opens the door for the return of the NCAA Football franchise. I’m not crying, you are. 
I’ve gone through the requisite stages of grief since 2013. At first, I denied the new reality by playing NCAA 14 for the next three years with updated rosters. Then, I went through unbridled anger as I learned how to play FIFA instead. Then, I bargained that Madden could be a decent alternative — it’s not. And for the past few years, I’ve settled into sadness, though I could never accept that NCAA was gone forever. 
Sports video games are pretty silly at face value. While most video game series release a new title every three or four years, sports franchises like EA Sports Madden or NBA 2K have to come out with a new game every year. With so little time to turn over a new game, the gameplay barely improves from year to year. Most of the time, people like me are paying $60 for a roster update every year and hardly a new game. As the years go by, players begin to feel empty and disconnected from their sport until drastic changes are made. 
Yet the NCAA Football franchise was always different. No game has better captured the essence of its sport. Fight songs accompanied every loading screen. Kirk Herbstreit and Brent Musburger manned the commentary booth, and Lee Corso made his trademark mascot-head picks before every game. In the vaunted career mode, Road to Glory, your player lived in a messy dorm and kept his trophies in a crate under the bed. Everything about the game meshed with the spirit of college football (including not paying players for their likenesses to appear in the game). 
The news that student athletes can be paid to appear in the game is great for fans, athletic departments and athletes alike. Ask almost any college football player and they’ll tell you that they dreamed of one day playing as themselves in a video game. At practice a couple months ago, senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. was asked about what his rating would be in NCAA Football and his eyes lit up (he said at the time that he’d be the highest rated player on the team). 
For a vast majority of players who will never make it to the NFL and see themselves in Madden, this creates an incredible opportunity to capitalize on their likeness while still in school. The game will also add visibility to athletic departments and conferences that are not as marketable as say USC or the SEC. It’s long overdue. Now give Reggie Bush his Heisman back and all will be right with the world. 
I can’t wait for the next midnight release at GameStop.

USC and No. 7 Oregon sit atop their respective divisions in the Pac-12 heading into Saturday as they both look to knock the other off their current standing at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
USC’s defense will likely be welcoming back defensive end Christian Rector, who sat out against Arizona and Colorado with an ankle injury. Rector said Wednesday that he felt 100% for the first time since Week 2 against Stanford.
“I’m just happy to be back out there and happy to be playing for this team,” Rector said. “Dealing with an injury sucks as an athlete, but I think I’m mentally stronger.”
Freshman cornerback Chris Steele also returned to practice Tuesday, while sophomore inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV resumed practice Wednesday.
“[Oregon does] a lot of great things,” Gaoteote said. “But with all that, it’s all just football, so we just got to compete.”
The Ducks are coming off a close 37-35 win against fellow Pac-12 North member Washington State after falling behind 35-34 with one minute remaining in the contest. A last-second field goal by freshman kicker Camden Lewis secured Oregon’s seventh straight win of the year.
Meanwhile, USC is also coming off a near-collapse against a Pac-12 division opponent as it snuck past Colorado 35-31 last Friday. The Trojans were led by freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis, who maintained his accuracy, completing 68.2% of his passes for 406 yards and four touchdowns.
Additionally, Colorado senior quarterback Steven Montez was on a roll early on against the Trojans, but after a hit from redshirt sophomore outside linebacker Hunter Echols, Montez did not look the same. Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast hopes USC’s defense will keep up the pressure when it encounters Oregon’s potent offense.
“[Oregon] gives you a lot of different personnel groups and run blocking schemes,” Pendergast said. “In the passing game, they use all parts of the field.” 
Pendergast also said Oregon’s offensive line is “one of the better ones” he has seen at the collegiate level.
Oregon is fighting for a spot in the College Football Playoff with senior quarterback and projected 2020 first-round pick Justin Herbert at the helm, while USC is looking to sneak its way toward a Pac-12 title and Rose Bowl appearance. 
“The key to us winning this game is to get the quarterback down,” Echols said. “We know Justin Herbert is an NFL guy, and in order to win this game we’re going to have to put pressure on the quarterback.” 
Echols added that the defense will have to “plaster” Oregon’s receiving corps consisting of juniors Johnny Johnson III and Jaylon Redd and freshman Mycah Pittman, the younger brother of USC senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr.
The Trojans will look to maintain their perfect home record at the Coliseum, despite the threat posed by the visiting Oregon offense. Slovis and his talented wideouts — including Pittman Jr., sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown and redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns — must continue to come up with big plays to get points on the board.
The game against Oregon will kick off 5 p.m. Saturday.

While most elementary school students in Los Angeles were lining up single file in preparation for recess or lunch Monday afternoon, students at Vermont Avenue Elementary School were assembling for a different reason: They were about to converse with an astronaut at the International Space Station as part of the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station Program.
Vermont Elementary is the first elementary school in L.A. to participate in a contact with the ISS via ARISS. The idea to apply for the contact came from the Young Scientists Program, an offshoot of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Joint Educational Project, a service-learning initiative that partners USC students with local community organizations. YSP comprises 24 teaching assistants, undergraduate USC students with STEM majors who assist with science lessons and activities at seven schools in the USC Family of Schools. 
In preparation for the call, each of the school’s approximately 270 third- through fifth-grade students wrote two questions for Italian astronaut and ISS commander Luca Parmitano, who has performed 45 similar educational contacts since 2013. A judging panel of YSP staff selected 20 of the student questions for the contact.
Facilitating the contact was no simple feat, said Rita Barakat, the assistant director of YSP. The application process takes nearly a year and resembles a grant application. It asks why the school is deserving of the collaboration and how the contact would benefit the community.
“We really talked a lot about the things that we already do at YSP, the fact that we’re targeting underrepresented groups in the Los Angeles Unified School District and trying to encourage them to pursue STEM education, realizing that science is not a scary thing,” Barakat said. “[Science is] not, you know, difficult; it’s not just for some people — it can be for everyone.”
YSP’s first application for a contact, submitted in 2017, was turned down. However, with help from local radio experts who had the proper equipment for the contact and were familiar with the application process, the program’s second attempt was approved.
Barakat said discussions with Vermont Elementary staff and preparation for the contact began in April. Barakat spent the summer preparing as well, amending YSP curriculum with a combination of “some quality space education, a little bit of ham radio and a little bit of ISS-specific information” and getting a ham radio license.
Barakat said she believed the contact would help the Vermont Elementary students put a human face to what they’ve been learning about space exploration.
“It is a pretty indescribable thing when the static fades away, and you actually get that clear reception, and the pass has really started,” Barakat said. “I think to see that age group and the way that they will be excited — that will be exciting for me.”
ARISS, an international organization devoted to arranging these contacts between schools around the world and astronauts aboard the ISS, has set up hundreds of educational contacts to date with schools on six continents. Most of ARISS’s members, including those who helped with Vermont Elementary’s contact, are knowledgeable volunteers with an interest in space, radio and science education.
Dieuwertje “DJ” Kast, STEM program manager at JEP, said the preparation leading up to the event was a significant undertaking. Before the contact, YSP staff coordinated the submission and selection of the questions and held a dress rehearsal of the event the Friday before to ensure that the timing of the questions was feasible. 
The event’s execution is especially important given the timely nature of the contact — the ISS travels at an estimated 17,000 miles per hour and was only within range of the school for an estimated eight minutes, so the Q&A had to begin promptly. 
“For me, it still baffles me that we’re able to connect to someone that’s in outer space, moving on the International Space Station, which actually will go above us eight times a day,” Kast said. “We can contact them for literally less than 10 minutes … The logistics of all that, just — it’s mind-blowing.”
Aundrea Marin, a fifth-grader at Vermont Avenue Elementary who was among the 10 selected to speak to Parmitano, asked him about his family. Marin said she was able to draw parallels between the astronaut’s answers and her own family.
“[Parmitano] ended up kind of relating to what I’m about in my family because he brought up his two daughters and his wife,” Marin said. “My dad, he has my little sister plus my mom, so knowing that if my dad was up there — and [Parmitano] said that he misses them so much, and if my dad was up there, I would miss him a lot too.”
ARISS educational ambassador Darrell Warren said the value of the contact lies in its interactivity, a component of education that he said is often talked about but needs to be implemented more widely.
“It becomes a real thing for them — it turns it into something real,” Warren said. “And I think it sort of broadens their view of what they are able to do, you know, because you talked to space as a kid — that’s pretty cool.”

When Philip Bliss first came to USC, he tried joining clubs on campus but found himself unable to connect with any. Inspired to come up with something new and exciting, he founded The Rabbit Hole, a club dedicated to conspiracy theories, last Spring. 
“I just thought that there weren’t that many clubs on campus that were academic but also very laid-back,” said Bliss, a junior majoring in economics mathematics. “I think a lot of clubs at USC are super cool but they’re a bit pre-professional and sometimes students just don’t know how to handle that, myself included.”
The club gives students a platform to discuss, debate and vote on conspiracy theories, no matter how outlandish they might be. The meetings are bi-weekly and one member introduces a topic each meeting. 
Other members share their viewpoints before the presentation and get the chance to ask questions and debate about the presentation after it is finished. Once that is done, members share whether they agree or disagree with the theory to see how the viewpoints may have shifted after the debate. 
“The entire purpose of the club is to debunk well-known or even not well-known conspiracy theories. [It’s] really to just get exposed to different ideas,” Bliss said. “I try to facilitate a discussion that’s breaking down some of the areas of disagreement so we can kind of understand what we disagree on and why is that and what facts can be misleading.”
While some of the conspiracies discussed venture into the supernatural and spooky realm, others concern more serious topics. The latest presentation focused on presidential treason and war crimes committed by previous presidents. 
“It definitely can make you question or be skeptical about the powers that govern us, but I think it’s very important to not become too pessimistic,” Bliss said. “We don’t want to be like typical conspiracy theorists who are jaded of the world. We just want to learn about these different topics and really see what they are objectively.”
Some of the past topics the club has covered include the War on Drugs, Nixon’s presidency and its effects on Black Americans and counterculture participants, the goals of former vice president Dick Cheney before and after 9/11, UFO sightings, Paul McCartney’s death and the Turkish military coup of 2016. 
Piril Nergis, a junior majoring in electrical engineering, led the recent discussion on the 2016 Turkish military coup. Nergis said her Turkish background gave her a chance to dig into the topic and talk to her family, leading her to discover multiple potential theories about the event. 
She also said it was a great opportunity to introduce other members to Turkey’s political climate. While she had been a member of the club and attended meetings last spring, this was Nergis’s first time presenting a topic. 
“It’s pretty cool actually how open-minded everyone is,” Nergis said. “So usually how it works is that we do a background of a topic. We really dive into it … and then we go into more of what conspiracy theories we are looking at.”
“It’s pretty fun because people ask you questions in between and [Bliss] … actually does a really good job of asking the right questions and getting the audience to engage,” she added.
Bliss said that no topic is ever off-limits, as long as it is respectful and engaging.
“I just think it’s kind of fun to talk about this stuff with people and really be a reasonable person while doing so, and so I think in achieving that, I achieve exactly what I set out to do, but in the future I think it’d be great to do something a little bit more in regard to giving back, ” Bliss said.
The club sold T-shirts and donated the proceeds to to the Flint Water Fund following their discussion on the Flint water crisis last year. This year, they are discussing fundraising ideas for a children’s education project that connects the susceptibility of children from low-income backgrounds to the War on Drugs. 
Vice President Michael Delucia said the club taught him to be unafraid of what he says and the position he takes, as long as he is respectful. He also says the club has engaged his critical thinking skills, enabling him to go further than a Google search to find answers on controversial issues. 
“I hope it’s fun for a lot of other people and just gets your mind thinking more than anything,” Delucia said.
Delucia added that the club does not require members to attend every meeting but rather encourages them to focus on issues they are interested in. 
“The biggest thing I see it bringing is that it’s an open forum for people to talk and share about things that, one, they’re very interested in, and two, are out of the normal scope of academia or normal media discourse,” Delucia said. “It really is like you’re going down the rabbit hole on a lot of things to find these hidden pieces of information.”

Though Halloween allows us to leave midterm madness behind for one night, nothing is more frightening than realizing you don’t have a costume planned. That fear can be quickly resolved by throwing on a simple last-minute costume. Here are several pop culture outfits you can make from items found in your own closet.
“The Office” Group Costume
Get the whole Dunder Mifflin staff together with Pam, Jim, Dwight and even Prison Mike. Pam requires a white button-down collared shirt and a gray skirt and cardigan, and don’t forget to part your hair to the side in typical Pam fashion! Dwight needs a dull, pale button-down shirt, brown tie, brown slacks, matching shoes and retro reading glasses (if you don’t own these, you can buy a pair of cheap aviator-style sunglasses and punch out the lenses). If you have time, part your hair down the middle and run to Trader Joe’s to pick up a bunch of red beets as props. 
Jim’s outfit is quite simple: A blue button down and gray slacks along with shoes to match will do, but a dashing smile makes the best accessory for this costume. Prison Mike has a full, tailored gray suit, white collared shirt, black shoes and, of course, a purple bandana for your head. Though simple to put together, beware: This costume also requires a fierce — highly over-the-top— backstory on what it’s like to live in prison. You can also Google Dunder Mifflin name tags for all of these characters, which adds a nice touch to the whole outfit.
Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande
An anti-couples costume couldn’t be more cringy than Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande. Davidson’s look is very similar to the outfit of the average tired college student; in other words, make sure to have dark circles under your eyes and a bright colored hoodie. Bring out your authentic Davidson look with a removable tattoo sleeve and frosted hair. 
For the “Dangerous Woman” look, mimic Grande’s classic high ponytail along with dramatic winged eyeliner. Her ensemble includes a pink sleeveless top, pink skirt, white stockings and cute white booties to match. It would not be a bad idea to include furry accessories such as cat ears, hair pom poms or a scarf, as she is always recognizable in those. 
Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian
Every blonde needs a brunette for Halloween. Throw it back to the early 2000s with besties Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian. 
Hilton’s outfit would include a midi-length tight dress in her signature color, silver. Kardashian’s outfit would consist of a short black dress with heavy dark eyeshadow. Both outfits would not be complete without bedazzled headbands, long necklaces and big earrings. At the end of the night, you’ll feel like you are on an episode of “The Simple Life.” Even Paris would compliment your outfit, saying, “That’s hot.”  
Mean Girls Group Costume
Another classic group Halloween costume sources inspiration from the infamous Halloween party in  “Mean Girls.” All you need to put together Regina George’s outfit would be a white bodysuit with a pair of rabbit ears and a cottontail — seriously, that is all you need.
Gretchen Wieners’ outfit can be easily put together with cat ears, a black long-sleeve top and a pair of black skinny jeans. Karen Smith just needs a pair of mouse ears and a black dress.  If you happen to have a wedding dress, don’t hesitate to throw it on and zombie’s teeth and make Cady Heron’s epic zombie bride costume.
VSCO Girl
What better way to address the biggest internet meme of the season than by being a VSCO Girl for Halloween? 
Grab your favorite pair of biker shorts, an infinite amount of scrunchies, a Hydro Flask, Puka shell necklace and a large T-shirt. 
Bonus points if you can find a shirt that says “Save the Turtles” on it. A VSCO girl can be seen in several types of footwear: Crocs, Birkenstocks and Vans. Take inspiration from @haileybieber for a better visual.

In 1853, people from all over the world headed west to the California Gold Rush with hope in their hearts and dollar signs in their eyes.
But those who really struck it rich were the ones who provided food, lodging and equipment to the miners. Two of those people were Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss, who cut and stuck rivets in cotton cloth to make a sufficiently sturdy pair of pants and unknowingly devised one of the most iconic pieces of clothing of all time. 
Jeans are as American as baseball, hot dogs and apple pie. You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t own a pair of jeans. If you walk down the street, the majority of passersby will be wearing jeans. 
Jeans are wardrobe workhorses. You can dress ’e’m up or down; you can wear ’em at the office, to the grocery store or on a first date.
But, in reality, jeans are ugly, unflattering and unattractive.
OK, hear me out. I’m not broadly condemning all jeans; my gripe is mostly with the super skinny jeans whose popularity skyrocketed in the early 2000s. Plus, in the interest of full disclosure, I do actually own two pairs myself: one from AGOLDE, with a boyfriend fit and criss-cross fly and one from APC that I altered to add tulle to the hems. 
I made an exception for these two because they are high-quality, well-made and long-lasting, but most importantly, they are statement pieces. 
When I wear them, they are the focal point of my outfit. However, I believe the vast majority of people consider jeans to be a sort of blank canvas — a safe, bland, boring option that’s nonexciting but non-offensive. They wear jeans because it’s the universal basic staple. And that’s a mistake, for two reasons: They don’t look good on anyone and they don’t look good with anything. 
They don’t look good on anyone
Jeans are the most stressful clothing to shop for, second only to swimsuits. We try on 50 pairs in the dressing room, twisting this way and that, wondering if our butt looks too big — or in the age of the Kardashians, if our butt looks too small. Why is it so hard to find a decent pair of jeans? 
First of all, jeans are not forgiving. Denim is a stiff, uncompromising fabric — just ask any Japanese raw selvedge enthusiast. But even for jeans with added stretch, it’s hard to wriggle your way into them. There’s a fine line between “sexy, so tight they look painted on” and “my legs are sheathed in sausage casings.” 
Jeans are often too constricting around the rear, smushing your ass down and making it seem flatter and wider than it is. High rise jeans have emerged as a solution, but all rises have their drawbacks.
High rise: You’re taut, you’re cinched, you’re snatched … but you can’t breathe.
Mid rise: Hits right below the belly button, creating the perfect muffin top situation. 
Low rise: I promise you, no one wants to see your thong.
Jeans can also shorten your legs. When you wear black pants with black shoes, the line of your leg is unbroken, creating an elongated silhouette. But I don’t know anyone who owns denim shoes, so wearing jeans with, for example, white sneakers, abruptly cuts off your leg. Plus, most jeans are already too long for the average person, so the excess fabric puddles around the ankle — not cute. 
Thus, jeans only look good on certain body types: 6-foot models with mile-long legs, or the apple-bottomed shawty in the club hypnotizing T-Pain. For those who are more short-legged and flat-assed — such as myself — jeans are a one-way ticket to schlubville. 
They don’t go with anything
Blue is finicky. It doesn’t play well with a lot of other colors. Its opposite on the color wheel is orange, which definitely doesn’t do anyone any favors. 
Black does not, in fact, go with anything; because blue is so subdued, wearing blue and black together will wash you out. Blue and white is the most attractive combination — think of the classic white T-shirt paired with blue jeans. But once you add other colors into the mix, things can get a little dicey.
But Kitty, you say. What about white/black/colorful jeans? All well and good, until you spill red wine on them or run them through a rinse cycle. All of a sudden, your inky black jeans have turned a sickly shade of grey. I can tell you from personal experience: The dyes used to color denim fade and bleed unbelievably easily. 
Also, let’s talk shoes. 
No shoes look good when you’re wearing jeans. Sandals are a summer shoe and should be paired exclusively with shorts, skirts or dresses, but never pants. Sorry, nothing will sway my mind on this. 
Flats are a personal pet peeve of mine, as they provide zero arch support and make your legs seem stubby: If your shoes don’t have a heel to contribute some extension, your inseam is gonna appear three inches shorter than it actually is. 
As for boots, have you ever tried to stuff five inches of denim into tightly-laced Doc Martens? Everyone knows that’s a recipe for severe bunching. (Bootcut jeans are an exception, of course, but who wants all that loose fabric flapping around their ankles?) And if you decide to wear them with sneakers like adidas or Converse, you might as well throw on an Aéropostale hoodie for good measure because voilà, you’ve instantly transported yourself back to middle school. 
Finally, I would be remiss not to mention the environmental impact of jeans. They are one of the most resource-intensive clothing items to produce, requiring almost 2,000 gallons of water to make one pair. Factory runoff containing chemicals used in indigo dye pollute and contaminate rivers. Why unduly burden the planet for something that’s ill-fitting and uncomfortable? 
Save your time, money and the earth by investing in some solid slim-fitted trousers, which I absolutely swear by — but that’s another column.

“It says your student body is 7% Asian,” my dad said when reading a feature story in my high school newspaper. “Do you know every Asian?”
While my father was attempting to make a joke sifting through the paper, the fact that Asians comprised such a small fraction of my school’s student population stuck with me for the rest of the day. Contrasted against an ethnic majority of 76% white students at my school, the data looked daunting. I never really realized, until that day, that the place I grew up in was actually inhibiting my ability to find my Asian identity.
I was a sophomore in high school at the time, but I had started to notice since elementary school that my ethnicity was something of a rarity where I grew up. Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, my small community of 12,000 people is predominantly white. 
Asian culture and values are observed to some degree but with little influence. While Asian cuisine and martial arts are both  prevalent in my community, it’s obvious that a large Eurocentric presence has taken residence in Marin County, where I’m from.
My youth played into my naivete, and I had not yet realized my school’s curriculum had failed to represent Asians in any substantial way. 
It was only until that year, when my mom took the initiative to present on Chinese New Year to my class, that I broke out of layers of whitewashing. Glancing around the room and noticing that my classmates seemed to think the topic was intriguing yet unfamiliar, I learned that I was marginalized and different.
This sense of ostracization only worsened in high school, as I was presented with two history class options my junior year: AP European History and United States History. While I understood the importance of learning the history of the country one resides in — and I ended up taking the latter as my mandatory history class — I was rather upset about the significant role European history plays in our education system. 
Ultimately, the system was defending an agenda, dictating that the European narrative was the most important and that all others, including my Asian heritage, were insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
While these history classes emitted a bleak message, it wasn’t the only department to do this. When I initially toured my high school in 2014, I was excited to hear that Mandarin was one of three languages offered to students. 
Almost unsurprisingly, my school canceled further teaching of the language before my freshman year began, preemptively blocking me from even joining the course. It was unnerving to watch the possibility of learning more about my roots dwindle away. And as my school pushed French and Spanish to the spotlight in it its language department, it was made clear that the European perspective was at the forefront of the curriculum’s priorities.
I suppose that this, along with other factors like not learning Cantonese or Mandarin growing up, is why it was easy for me to default on “banana” culture, yellow on the outside, white on the inside. 
Being a “banana” felt like a sense of conformity, assimilating into the masses and assuming the characteristics of those around me. Acting white became normal, especially when I was the only person of a minority race in a class, which has occurred in a few of my classes throughout my education. 
Last summer, I was able to break out of the norm and experience my cultural roots firsthand. While I could have found an opportunity to study abroad at USC, I felt that it would have been too long a wait. I traveled to Beijing and Hong Kong, where my family came from and the place where my father was born. 
The experience was eye-opening in many respects, from hearing Mandarin and Cantonese used fully for the first time to understanding the local customs and ways of life. Even though it was insightful to experience these places, the larger message was that marginalized cultures must take the initiative to explore their roots themselves.
Having white influence is not a bad thing. However, white cultural dominance must not be allowed to deter ethnic groups from learning more about their identity. The problem lies deep within the U.S. education system, and it can only be alleviated with a greater understanding of other cultures and including their teachings and messages within their communities and curriculums. 
Asian perspectives should be cherished and allowed to flourish, starting within the basic building block of the classroom.

This weekend, USC will welcome thousands of guests over the span of four days during Trojan Family Weekend. Students are encouraged to invite as many family members as they choose: parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins. With “something for everyone,” the weekend is advertised as an opportunity for families to connect with their students and engage in hundreds of unique campus activities. 
But is Family Weekend really accessible? Only 39% of the incoming 2018 class is from California. Not to mention, USC’s international students make up about 24% of the student body and 17% of last year’s freshman class. 
Registration for Family Weekend begins at $100 for adults but increases up to $175 for last minute tickets. Since Trojan Family Weekend is a self-supported event, some kind of fee is understandable. However, this is a much higher cost than in past years. In 2014, the price was capped at $100 per parent. 
Additionally, registration fees do not include highly-coveted football game tickets, which must be purchased separately and can run $100-plus per person. This also does not include the cost of potential tailgate reservations, which start at $45 or parking passes on campus. 
Although scholarships and discounts for early registration are offered, these small concessions still do not offset a variety of other associated costs. Taking into account registration fees, football game tickets, airfare, hotels, car rentals, food, activities around L.A. and more, the financial cost of Family Weekend adds up quickly. 
It is far more convenient for local families to make the trip to USC if they choose. However, many out-of-state families do not have this option. They may be unable to afford the many costs associated with Family Weekend. 
Also, many may feel the late October date falls too close to Thanksgiving, another short break where out-of-state and international students are forced to decide whether to make the trek home. Because of these barriers, some students may end up feeling isolated or excluded from the weekend’s spirit, one where participation necessitates having family present. 
As a University that prides itself on diversity, inclusion, unity and family, perhaps USC should consider alternative programming for students whose families cannot attend. 
The University could even rethink the way it presents Family Weekend. Instead of simply focusing on actual family members, why not lean into a notion so integral to USC’s image: the lasting “Trojan Family?” Made up of friends, colleagues, professors and staff, the Trojan family goes beyond blood and is a community we carry with us long after we leave USC’s campus. Why not use this idea to include students whose families are not on campus, showing them that they are not alone?
The Alumni Association, a well-known face of the “Trojan Family,” could interact with and further include students whose families cannot visit, emphasizing that they are valued members in a network of lifelong USC grads. 
Residential colleges could inspire students to share their pride by hosting activities for residents instead of only parents. International and out of state students should speak on panels and offer their insight to make Family Weekend a more inclusive event for those with financial constraints. 
All students, regardless of whether their families attend Family Weekend, should feel like they are able to participate. 
“Trojan Family for life” may be more commonly said after graduating from USC, but that doesn’t mean students should feel left out of this family while they’re here.

A common experience for many first-year STEM majors is having to cope with incredibly large, difficult introductory classes in their chosen fields. The classes typically demand a higher level of dedication and time management to be successful. Though it is essential to introduce incoming students to college-level expectations, many students feel discouraged by the initial difficulty and may choose to change their focus area due to their experience in the classes.
Students in these quintessential classes must quickly develop their study skills to finish with a decent grade and continue studying in the field of their choice. Even if a student receives a good grade, the class difficulty may discourage them from continuing to study that subject. 
Averages have a high importance in classes like this as well, and students are constantly working to stay above the curve and thus, above their classmates. This causes a cutthroat culture and a poor learning environment, as oftentimes students lack a team mentality, which causes unnecessary competition. 
Incoming students already feel overwhelmed with the stress of moving to a new place, and a competitive culture does not help them feel at ease in their new environment. Although high school preparation for college-level courses helps them adapt better, most students do not have control over the way in which classes are taught yet still suffer the consequences of failure.
A 2012 study by the Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics found that STEM students are about 6% more likely to change majors than non-STEM students. This is likely due to the culture of “weed-out” classes that discourage many students from pursuing degrees that could lead them to a successful career in STEM, especially as the world grows and needs more scientists. 
Some may believe that this style of classes narrows the group so that only the very top students will remain, but others recognize that this obviously does not create a healthy learning environment for students. 
Students declare their intention to study STEM during the college application process, so the school has an obligation to help these students stay on the track they indicated. Weed-out classes should not be a discouraging part of that process.
The cutthroat academic culture affects individuals differently, and the University should keep this in mind when designing courses for incoming students. 
Weed-out classes create a negative learning environment, which contradicts the primary goal of a university: to educate its students. 
If a class is major requirement, then that class should allow as many students as possible to learn the material and continue their pursuit of that major, not deter them from furthering their studies.

Danny Trejo, widely known for his role in “Spy Kids” as Machete, joined an Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism class on Hollywood and entertainment as a guest speaker to talk about his life experiences and the importance of Latinx representation in the media. 
Trejo explained that he grew up around people who used drugs and said he was influenced by his uncle Gilbert at only eight years old. As a result of his drug use and involvement in crimes, Trejo said he served jail and prison time before discovering acting. 
After his release, Trejo decided to channel his efforts into helping others who were struggling with addiction, becoming a part of their recovery process.  He also kept himself busy working as a court liaison, a drug counselor and a boxer. To Monday’s talk, Trejo brought along Clancy, the managing director at the Midnight Mission on Skid Row and Mario, a man he sponsors, to show the support system he’s helped built directly.
While working as a drug counselor, one of his clients reached out to him, explaining the urge he was having to do cocaine while working on a movie set. Trejo showed up for him and helped him resist the urge. While on the movie set, Trejo was approached by someone on set who asked if he would like to be an extra in the movie “Runaway Train,” leading to one of his first movie roles.
At the start of his Hollywood career, Trejo was cast to play roles that involved playing the tough guy and the criminal, due to his gruffy voice and rugged looks. He became one of the most recognizable Latino faces in the world as his career grew larger and larger.
Being a prominent Latino figure in the film industry has given other Latinx people a chance to see that it is possible to complete ones dreams, no matter where one may come from, the actor said. Minorities may not always get to see themselves being portrayed in comics, movies, or TV shows, but filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, who Trejo has worked with, introduced the character Machete, which gave the Latinx community a character to identify with. 
“Robert Rodriguez’s idea when he made Machete, he made a Latin American hero out of a laborer,” Trejo said. “What surprised me is that on Halloween, kids were coming to the door and they were dressed like Machete; they weren’t dressed like Superman or Batman but as the hero they saw, [who] was Latino.”
Giving Latinx people more representation in film and media allows them to connect more by visually seeing themselves playing a role in society, Trejo explained. However, he said there are still many stereotypes about underrepresented groups in entertainment.
“I think we’ve broken down a lot of doors; we’ve got like Selma Hayek, a star, we have Jessica Alba … you know like slowly, it’s a process,” Trejo said. “Everybody has been stereotyped for a long time, and we’re starting to work out of it … there’s still room for improvement, but it’s getting better.”
The class listened carefully, taking in Trejo’s stories about his struggles, as well as his stories about success, and joined him in laughter as he shared his experiences. 
Marissa Fitzgerald, a senior majoring in music industry, said she felt motivated hearing what Trejo had to say and saw how it was possible to overcome adversity. 
“I thought the whole conversation today was really inspiring just to see how much somebody can turn their life around and how much success he’s had in so many different ventures,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s also inspiring just to see different ways you can become successful — there’s not just one path to success and it’s different for everybody.”
It was important to associate professor of professional practice Mary Murphy to bring someone with Trejo’s perspective to talk to a group of college students about the different ways a person can succeed. Murphy coordinated the conversation with the actor so that he could shed light on Latinx performers in Hollywood. 
“I also wanted to show students that you can start out in jail and in prison and you could end up having a good life and I knew that’s what had happened to him, you know, that he had turned his life around,” Murphy said. “He’s been in over 350 movies and TV shows and yet he also uses his fame and works with the homeless, he carries thermal underwear and socks in his car and so all the guys around him do that and they give it out to the homeless, so I felt that he wouldn’t just be another Hollywood actor, but one who actually really had a message.”
Trejo is a testament for so many people who have struggled and have been knocked down over and over again, that it is still possible to succeed, as well as help others with your success, Murphy said. The professor said she hoped that her students took many valuable lessons from Trejo.
“I hope my students took away so many life lessons about second chances, about persistence, helping others, it’s very clear his life is devoted to helping others and in helping others, people help him,” Murphy said.
