Argentines love a good cafe.  A place where they can meet with their friends and loved ones at any time of the day to catch up on life over a cup of coffee and a pastry.  While I cannot say that I’ve found better coffee here than at some of my favorite spots in Los Angeles, I will admit that the all around atmosphere of an Argentine cafe is hard be beat.  The environment, food, drink and culture all come together in the perfect combination that will make cafe visits anyone’s afternoon delight.
There are so many different cafes in Buenos Aires, when looking for one you can’t go wrong.  They can be found on almost any street with both indoor and outdoor seating options depending on the environment you’re looking for.  Some cafes even have a courtyard or upstairs terrace where you can take some time out of the day to step off the busy streets and enjoy a quiet afternoon caffeine boost.
My most recent find has been the cafe at the back of the bookstore “Libros del Pasaje” just a few blocks from my house.  This small shop with floor-to-ceiling books on just about every topic imaginable has the perfect seating area and study space with an overhead skylight.  They also offer a great menu of coffees, sandwiches and sweets — my favorite is the cold brew.
Aside from the atmosphere and menu, the most important aspect that sets the cafes of Buenos Aires apart is the cultural mindset of the people who occupy them — servers and patrons alike. In B.A., most people don’t get their coffee to go, and some places won’t even allow you to.   This, however, is an important part of making these cafes so special.
Argentines run on their own schedule and are hardly ever in a rush to get places on time.  This was a difficult adjustment for me coming from the U.S. where I, along with the rest of Americans, are constantly rushing and complaining about not having enough hours in the day.  Argentines treat their time almost as if they have too much of it.  I have come to love this more relaxed lifestyle and adopted it as my own.  While it will be difficult to readjust to the fast paced North American culture, I have learned that this South American mindset should not be looked at as time-wasting, but rather as living in the moment or making the most of the present.
This mindset is crucial to the beauty of the B.A. cafe.  You will never find a waiter who is rushed to give you the check and turn over the table.  You get to spend as much time in the establishment as you wish and you let the server know when you’re ready to leave. This is why the cafes are such an important part of Argentine culture.  They are places where friends and family come together and spend an afternoon sitting and enjoying each other’s company without feeling rushed like I know I might be in a busy cafe in Los Angeles.  My time spent at cafes in Buenos Aires have been some of my most valuable.  It is in these havens that I have written some of my best essays and strengthened some of my closest friendships.

For more than 30 years, talk show host David Letterman dominated late-night comedy. Unlike the brash comedians of his generation, Letterman showcased an off-brand, self-deprecating humor that touched audiences across the nation. Indeed, his comedy routine was groundbreaking, influencing many well-known comics of today, including Conan O’Brien, Ray Romano and Jim Gaffigan. Fellow talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel cites Letterman as the sole impetus behind his career in comedy.
But like most television programs, Late Show with David Letterman eventually had to come to a close. On May 20, Letterman commemorated his final talk-show hour with celebrity fanfare and highlights from his three decades and more than 6,000 episodes of entertainment. The finale emphasized Letterman’s legacy as quick-witted interviewer with no need for Jimmy Fallon’s musical frills and silly games. His routine is simple, hitting the very core of humor. It was the perfect goodbye to a television mega-power, starting with an epic cold open, complete with none other than President Barack Obama.
Letterman is never bashful of the political world, sometimes bantering with conservatives such as political commentator Bill O’Reilly and senator and former presidential candidate John McCain on the air. He’s also interviewed former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. His cold open with Obama, though, is a reminder that humor doesn’t have to be high-brow and filled with derision of the government to resonate with an audience. Instead, Letterman turned the laughs on himself. Obama set the tone by declaring, “Our long, national nightmare is over. Letterman is retiring.” Letterman quipped, “You’re just kidding, right?” to which Obama just responded with a shrug. It’s material like this that will be missed.
Letterman continues to be the brunt of the joke, pretending that the people watching did not appreciate his brand of humble comedy. His monologue started off with a few reflections on current events, the punchlines all pointing back to himself. A clip of Letterman interviewing children over the years followed, where almost all of the kids seemed irritated by his presence. One kid even told Letterman, “You are not, you are not, you are not funny.” Kids before a certain age might not relate to Letterman, but to adults, his ability to not take himself seriously is his most endearing characteristic.
If there is a favorite Letterman show trademark, it’s his top 10 lists. Every episode features a category with 10 Letterman musings, and the last episode was no exception. With his send-off, 10 of his most frequent guests entered the stage one by one, each with a facetiously biting comment about their friend, Dave. Actor Alec Baldwin revealed, “Of all the talk shows, yours was the most geographically convenient to my home.” Football player Peyton Manning made this comparison: “You are to comedy what I am to … comedy.” But it was Tina Fey and Chris Rock who really brought it home. Fey quipped, “Thanks for finally proving men can be funny,” a rebuttal to the ever present “women are not funny” comments. Rock exclaimed, “I’m just glad your show is being given to a white guy,” in response to CBS network’s decision to replace Letterman with Stephen Colbert, a move that was out of Letterman’s hands. But jokes aside, it was apparent that Letterman wholeheartedly supported these entertainers in their endeavors, and they were there to thank him for years of collaboration and friendship.
The rest of the show followed accordingly. Letterman handpicked The Foo Fighters, a band that was often featured on the show, to perform their song, “Everlong.” He introduced his wife and son, and as a Letterman idiosyncrasy, He also introduced his son’s bewildered friend, Tommy Roboto. He thanked his band leader, the equally funny Paul Schaffer, for their years of partnership. In his closing credits, Letterman wished Colbert the best of luck, signaling a new era to come. These segments epitomize Letterman’s supportive spirit.
All in all, it was the quintessential denouement to late nights with Letterman. He represented someone who didn’t need to belittle others in order to get a laugh. His most famous bits were always a little strange — watermelon smashing and campy parodies of after school specials come to mind — but Letterman knew that in order to make others laugh, he had to make himself laugh first.
So now Stephen Colbert steps up. And even with his unbelievable repertoire for comedy, he has shoes of monumental proportions to fill.

In his 1971 performance art piece “Shoot,” Chris Burden introduced himself to the artistic world by having his assistant shoot him in the left arm from only 16 feet away. Still relatively unknown at the time, he was not only endangering himself but his potential for a career — and that was intriguing to many viewers.
On May 10, Burden passed away at the age of 69, causing the art community and the media to examine his expansive collection of works once again. He was the man behind “Urban Light” (2008), the photogenic lamps in front of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He also put together kinetic sculptures such as “Metropolis II” (2011) or “Porsche with Meteorite” (2013) that would have a life of their own, moving and reacting long after installation. He was a professor and a working artist, straddling the divide between academic interpretation and physical involvement in the art world.
His work was all about extremes, reactions and involvement. An onlooker to any one of his pieces develops an opinion immediately; his work incites a knee-jerk reaction that is alternately hatred, love or simple confusion. A viewer cannot just disregard the work. This is, perhaps, one of the most important aspects of his career both as a performance artist and an artist of the post-modern era. In a world where so many things compete for the public’s attention, art often needs to reach out to viewers and draw them in, addressing them specifically and not letting them go easily. Burden realized this as early as his first major works in the 1970s — art must be challenging, both to the artist and the audience. While that concept of “challenge” is distinctly different for each context, for Burden, it was the creation of massive extremes and dramatic involvement.
Born in 1946, Burden showed promise early on both academically and artistically in the world of fine art, completing his undergraduate degree at Pomona College and his Master of Fine Arts at University of California, Irvine. In a 1979 interview with Jim Moisan for “High Performance,” he explained that it was during his work toward his master’s degree that he first began to create art that required involvement on the part of the audience as well as manipulation of the mind, body or both.
It was when Burden studied under Robert Irwin, a Southern California painter and installation artist, that he first put together performances that attracted the public’s attention: “Shoot” (1971); “Five Day Locker Piece” (1971), where he stayed trapped inside a locker for five days with only a 5-gallon jug of water; “Through the Night Softly” (1973), where he filmed himself crawling through 50 feet of broken glass; and “Transfixed” (1974), where he had an assistant crucify him on the roof of a Volkswagen car. The elements of danger and fear seemed implicit in his pieces, but perhaps more than anything these earliest works were about involvement; he explained to Moisan in his interview that the goal was to be as highly involved in his mental and physical fate as possible. In a post-modern world filled with uncertainty, playing with ideas of control over oneself and one’s situation was more than timely.
Fast-forward 40 years: The Chris Burden who passed away less than a month ago was a changed artist. Instead of performances, he was putting together moving structures of monumental size that were much less notorious but no less involved. Throughout those years, Burden matured as an artist — he didn’t need to be so present physically in his artwork because he was creating a long legacy and body of work that was able to speak for him and would continue to do so in his absence. Instead of being single moments in time, his more recent pieces can be revisited; they are self-sustaining works set in motion by Burden.
It is within this context that Burden’s last piece, “Ode to Santos Dumont” (2015), emerged. After almost 10 years of research, coordination, invention and assembly, it is being presented at LACMA from May 18 until June 21. The exhibition hall is empty except for the audience and the airship, giving the huge room the feeling of a garage workshop housing experimental prototypes.  The piece itself is a cigar-shaped blimp modeled after Alberto Santos-Dumont’s dirigible that flew around Paris in 1901 and set the tone for a century of technological advancement, creativity and ingenuity. In fact, it’s propelled by an exact quarter-scale replica of a 1903 De Dion gasoline motor, sized to fit the proportions of the piece. The balloon itself, which appears to be made out of a material about the consistency of a beach ball, is attached to the motor and body of the ship with nearly invisible wires that give “Ode to Santos Dumont” the feeling of untethered lightness.
But for all the lightness and simplicity of the visual established by the piece, there is a depth of complexity and intricacy that lies at its foundation. Master mechanic John Biggs, who was there at the performance to make sure that the airship worked as promised, veritably invented and constructed the quarter-scale motor from scratch. Anchored with thin wires to a center rotation point, the blimp is filled with a very specific amount of helium so that it reaches neutral buoyancy; this causes it to always seek a perfect 60-foot circle path no matter where it starts out. The perfection of the proportions is nearly palpable.
“Ode to Santos Dumont” is a highly refined machine with relevance as an homage, technological feat and aesthetic statement. It is also perhaps most meaningful as the last point on Burden’s career timeline marked by involvement and progressive maturation. In the case of the construction of the airship, Burden created the concept and then delegated tasks, overseeing everything but solely responsible for nothing. Even if Burden had lived to see its debut, he would still not be directly involved with it as he had with his early works.
The mechanism is highly specialized, as only Biggs has the skills to ensure its flight; once it is set in motion, not even he has a hand in it. With Ode to Santos Dumont, Burden created performance art without a performer, embedding the “performance” aspect within the artwork’s own motions. As such, Burden is always able to be there, present in his legacy of performance, movement and involvement that seem to have been the culmination of his life.

As a political science major and general politics enthusiast, I’m more than thrilled to have the privilege to spend my summer interning in Sacramento, California, at a public affairs firm that focuses on strategic political communications for large corporations. My experience working in and around the capital as a frequent attendee of various hearings has inspired me to start this column, “Capitol Talk.”
In the midst of the forthcoming presidential elections, politicians and constituents have felt the burgeoning pressure to endorse, select and predict the best candidates. Though the presidential campaign has historically followed the same pattern, this election cycle might present a different lesson to Americans in the art of political campaigning and strategy.
Structurally, political campaigns follow a similar pattern. Once candidates from all parties are selected to move forward in the general election, money from political action committees and super PACs are distributed at full speed and advertisements begin. In terms of focusing on the two major political parties, Republican and Democratic, numerous potential candidates from both parties have hinted toward running for the presidency.
But the example of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s formal announcement for presidency last month, and Jeb Bush’s lack of a official announcement, sets a model for why declaring presidency so early on in the election may not yield optimal returns as some strategists have predicted it to do so.
Latest polling results released from Gallup have displayed unfavorable ratings for Hillary Clinton up 7 percentage points within the last two months. As time progresses, results are showing that Clinton has steadily lost popularity among the general public, especially in key swing states. She may show poise and strength in the primary election, but by the general election, Hillary Clinton could easily lose.
It is nearing the end of May and Clinton’s campaign for presidency is already losing momentum. By the middle of the general election, her resources will be outdone by candidates such as Bush.
At this time, many would predict Bush to have officially announced his candidacy for president. But, as I sit here at the steps of the Capitol after a long day of interning, wondering when Bush will decide to make his official announcement to the nation, there is still no word of any formal declaration. Despite a slip up in the media a week ago, Bush has still not technically declared. He’s used several qualifiers to back up his unofficial announcement and constantly lets the public know what he will do to solve education crises “if,” he runs for president.
So, what is influencing his decision to announce so late in the game and why?
Bush has done something extremely clever in the realm of campaign finance. First, he has decided to halt his official candidacy to raise more funding for his super PAC, Right to Rise. When Citizens United removed the sanction on corporations and unions making what they defined as “independent expenditures and financing electioneering communications,” campaign finance took a new turn.
As long as Bush remains unofficial, he technically has the ability to accept millions of dollars from a single donor, while receiving financial support and funding backed by large corporations and unions, on behalf of his super PAC. Unlike the campaign finance restraints other senatorial candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have, in terms of creating and coordinating a super PAC, Bush can continue to gather more and more support to keep his campaign running until he wins the seat.
But once Bush officially runs for a seat in federal office, he cannot  communicate with the super PAC to the same degree. As long as he continues to wait to announce, Bush’s super PAC can put him ahead of Clinton. Both candidates, however,  have fluctuating approval rates. Bush might not be the ultimate favorite in the media, but his campaign money, will lend towards several campaign ads and get-out-the-vote mechanisms, which will garner more support for his race.
Second, Bush, unlike his formidable opponent, seems to have noticed that announcing candidacy early on leaves room for loss of momentum. While Clinton’s early announcement appeared to be effective, numbers are saying otherwise. The combination of these two factors are strong enough to predict that Bush will do well in the campaign for presidency, moving ahead of Clinton.

So, the more laws for money in politics, the worse it becomes. I understand that some people want to control money in politics. There is only illusion of control. There is no actual control.

Pablo Picasso’s “Women of Algiers (Version O)” made headlines recently after it sold for a record-breaking $179.4 million at a Christie’s auction.  The painting made headlines again after a local New York Fox news station censored the breasts of three women depicted in the piece.
New York’s Fox 5, the news station in question, seemingly regarded the breasts as too graphic to air on cable television, despite the abstract-Cubist proportions of the women.  A pair of buttocks, however, remained conspicuously uncensored.
Art critics and historians severely criticized Fox 5 in its decision to censor the three sets of bosoms, for the station’s negligence to consider the importance and purpose of artistic expression.  The censorship does not come as a great shock, though. Fox 5’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, is an affiliate of News Corp. part of Rupert Murdoch’s colossal rain cloud of conservative media.  In truth, the issue presents a much bigger problem than the defocused aberrations of an abstract breast.  This type of censorship not only lessens the impact of the painting itself, but also perpetuates the sexualization of the female body.
On one hand, it’s rather amusing that Picasso’s work is perceived just as provocatively more than 50 years after it was completed as it originally was. But for all intents and purposes, the breasts depicted in this painting are no more than a curved line and a dot.  Picasso interpreted his lust for the female body through the scandalous superlatives of his now signature style.  Though he is labeled as a misogynist for the rather vivid portrayals in his showcased work (among other reasons), this representation is not so much objectification as it is a manifestation of sexual freedom.
Sexualization of the female body is a man-made concept, a notion that dates far prior to the tantalizing brushstrokes of Picasso’s daring hand.  Society’s ingrains the impression that the female body is somehow erotic and must be suppressed in order to prevent adultery and fornication.  Instead of placing responsibility on the patrilineal figures, the blame is continually set on women.
Sexual freedom and sexual objectification should be mutually exclusive; a woman should have the right to sexual expression without the suspicion of amorality.  Because society views female sexuality as licentious, while male sexuality is seen as a preferment for masculinity and dominance, the female sex is subjected to ridicule from a perception that stems from this patriarchal ideal.  Though male bodies are also subjected to similar objectification to some degree, the media rarely blur out men’s washboard abs or titanic biceps.
At the other end of the spectrum, this mutual exclusion takes form in, for example, the many Carl’s Jr. commercials involving a scantily dressed woman washing a car.  In this case, the female is not in control of her own sexuality. She is merely exhibited on a pedestal to stir desire in the audience.  This bothersome sales tactic, transparently referred to as “sex sells,” is created by the same male-dominated society that condemns female sexual expression.  When you put all the pieces together, society produces a culture that ironically oppresses women’s sexualization while promoting such sexualization for men’s pleasure. Instead of criticizing the culture in question, society chooses to attack the female specifically.  When a woman is subjected to sexual harassment or assault, it is often questioned if the female victim did anything to “ask for” these sexual advances (i.e. the way she was dressed, how she chose to present herself, etc.).
The sexualization of women is unavoidable in today’s age because, unfortunately, it’s created and represented everywhere by the media and other institutions. One could step out onto the street right now and detect dozens of billboard advertisements supporting this claim.  To ensure that people in society realize the oppression they receive from the media, instances such as the censorship on Picasso’s painting must not be ignored. Instead, they should hopefully inspire individuals to fight for their rights and fair treatment. Because we, as a society, created this stigma, we also have the ability to demolish it.
There is nothing wrong with non-sexual nudity, and certainly nothing wrong with being top free. nudist is a heathly lifestyle.
I totally agree!!  In fact I’m hoping you will post a picture of your breasts in this comment section to further demonstrate your disgust of censoring the female body.  
u must be high on testosterone!

USC seniors Yannick Hanfmann and Jonny Wang took losses at this year’s NCAA Round of 16 at Hurd Tennis Center in Waco, Texas, but still ended their time at USC with All-American statuses and strong career singles records.
Hanfmann and Wang were set against higher seeded opponents following their stellar performance at the Round of 32 and Round of 64. Hanfmann, who was a 9-16 seed, was set against Noah Rubin of Wake Forest, the No. 7 seed in the draw.
Rubin took a lead against Hanfmann in the first set, working up to a 6-2, 6-4 win that would bring Hanfmann’s journey to a close while sending Rubin off to the quarterfinals.
Wang, who secured his first ITA All-American this season, was set against Felipe Soares of Texas Tech. Wang fought hard, pushing the game into a third set. Soares, however, came back with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 victory in the end.
Wang and Hanfmann played well in the NCAA Singles Championship, securing  straight-set victories in the Round of 64, which led to their advancement to the NCAA Round of 32 singles, where they secured another victory.
In the NCAA Round of 64, Hanfmann played against Oklahoma’s No. 44 Dane Webb, beating him 6-3, 6-1. Wang defeated Samir Iftikhar from New Mexico in a 6-1, 6-4 win — securing Wang’s place in the NCAA Round of 32 for the second time in a row. USC senior Roberto Quiroz also secured a win against Jack Findel-Hawkins in the first round and was able to move on to the Round of 32 as well.
Quiroz dropped out after a 6-4, 6-4 loss to No. 9 Quentin Monaghan of Notre Dame in the Round of 32. He ended his career with an admirable       122-28 all-time record. Wang played against Julian Lenz of Baylor on his home court, knocking out a 6-2, 1-6, 7-5 win in a tense and evenly matched game. Hanfmann secured his place more easily in his matchup against Christopher Eubanks of Georgia Tech in a 6-2, 6-0 win leading him straight to the NCAA Round of 16.
In the Doubles Round of 32, Hanfmann and Quiroz played against Texas’                                         Glasspool/Hess-Olesen – leading to a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory for the Longhorns, and ending Hanfmann and Quiroz’s season together. As a team, Hanfmann and Quiroz had a 22-8 overall doubles record as well as achieving the 2014 ITA National Indoors Doubles Champions this season.
Reaching the NCAA Round of 16 secured Hanfmann’s fifth ITA All-American honor as well as the ITA Southwest Region Player of the Year award for this season. Hanfmann also leaves behind his career singles record of 110-34 at Troy. Haufmann was instrumental in the Trojans’ success at the 2012 and 2014 NCAA Championships.
Wang also leaves behind an impressive legacy of a 96-32 career singles record, with a 31-9 record for his senior year at USC. In addition to gaining his first ITA All-American for reaching the Round of 16, Wang was also the ITA Southwest Region honoree for Most Improved Senior of the Year.

Memorial Day is often thought of as the kickoff to summer, a day filled with polo shirts, barbecues and sports. But this day is really about remembering and honoring those we lost who have gave the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the freedoms that we take for granted daily.
The sports world does not stop for its fallen heroes, even though there have been many.  The NBA and NHL playoffs roar on towards their championship accumulation, and the MLB is nearly two months into its lengthy season. While our fallen athletes might have never reached their full potential on the field, they’ve done more for our country than they ever could have with a ball or bat.  This Memorial Day, we should remember our former soldiers for their service to our country and honor their teams in their memory.
One of the most notable and recent athletes to abandon civilian life was Pat Tillman.  The All-Pro safety for the Arizona Cardinals was drafted in the seventh round of the 1998 draft. Following the 9/11 attacks, Tillman opted to forgo a three-year, $3.6 million contract to enlist with the Army Rangers.  Tillman was deployed to Iraq, and returned to America to graduate from Ranger School in 2003. He was then redeployed to Afghanistan where he was killed in a friendly fire incident.
Bob Kalsu was another star in the making before he gave up his career to fight for America.  The All-American offensive tackle from Oklahoma started nine games for the Buffalo Bills in his rookie stint in the 1968 season. The following year he enlisted in the Army to satisfy his ROTC requirement. Despite being given the option to join the Reserves, Kalsu insisted on committing to active duty. In November of 1969, Kalsu found himself fighting in Vietnam. Eight months later, Kalsu suffered a severe head injury from a mortar and died just a day before his wife gave birth to their second child.
Andrew Jackson (Jack) Lummus Jr. was a baseball and football standout at Baylor University. Following his graduation, he signed with the New York Giants in 1941, helping them win the Eastern division before losing in the championship game to the Chicago Bears. The game was just a short two weeks after the shocking attack on Pearl Harbor. In January of 1942, Jack joined the Marine Corps.  Lummus rose to the rank of first lieutenant and led troops to storm the beaches of Iwo Jima in what would prove to be one of the most heroic and important battles of World War II.  Lummus was mortally wounded in the battle, losing both legs from enemy grenades.  He continued to lead and inspire his men as they battled in his honor.  He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage.
Elmer Gedeon began his athletic career at University of Michigan, where he was a three-sport star earning                     All-American honors in track and field, as well as lettering in baseball and football.  In 1939, Gedeon chose to sign with the Washington Senators and spent only 67 games in the minor leagues before being called up to major league action.  He was given only 15 major league        at-bats and returned to the minor leagues for most of 1940 before being drafted into the Army. There, he worked his way to becoming a pilot.  He survived a plane crash during training and received the Soldier’s Medal for returning to the wreckage to save others.  In 1944, while flying over France, Gedeon’s bomber had just finished its mission when the plane was hit in the cockpit, sending Gedeon and five other soliders to their deaths.
These athletes sacrificed not only their promising careers, but also their lives as Americans. Next time you head to your backyard for a quick pickup game, remember why we have the freedoms that we do.

This past weekend, No. 1 women’s tennis finished up their season at the NCAA Tournament with a loss in the semifinals to No. 4 Vanderbilt, 4-0. While the score was a sweep, the match was much closer. Vanderbilt went on to defeat No. 2 UCLA to take home the title.
To get to the semifinals, the Women of Troy kicked off tournament play at home, defeating both Youngstown State and Virginia Tech 4-0, respectively. They then headed off to Waco, Texas, defeating    No. 16 Texas Tech 4-0 in the Round of 16 and advancing past No. 8 Baylor 4-1 in the quarterfinals.
En route to the semifinals, the Women of Troy showed why they were the tournament’s No. 1 seed. Dominating their opponents through the quarterfinals of the tournament, USC looked ready to take the championship.
In most games, the Women of Troy came out strong and decisively took the doubles point, but Vanderbilt started off the match with the point. A lightning delay stopped play for about 45 minutes.
When play resumed, the Commodores attacked quickly; they won four of the six first sets of singles play. USC put up a strong fight, but in the end, Vanderbilt came out on top.
While the team may have been upset in the semifinals, USC still had four individuals seniors Sabrina Santamaria and Zoe Scandalis, junior Giuliana Olmos and freshman Madison Westby — and two doubles pairs — sophomore Zoe Katz with Santamaria and Olmos with Scandalis — in the Round of 64.
Santamaria captured the 2013 NCAA Doubles Championship with partner Kaitlyn Christian, but she missed out on last year’s NCAA tournament after she suffered an ACL injury in the early part of the 2014 season.  In her third time in the NCAA Singles play, Santamaria claimed her third set of ITA All-American honors for singles play. In her   less-than-four season of competition, Santamaria was instrumental in her time at USC: she was a five-time ITA All-American, 2013 NCAA Doubles Champion and 2013 Pac-12 Player of the Year.
In singles play, Scandalis lost in the Round of 64, Westby and Olmos lost in the Round of 32 and Santamaria lost in the Round of 16.
In doubles play, Katz and Santamaria lost in the Round of 32 while Olmos and Scandalis lost in the Round of 16.
In the Round of 64, Olmos had a rematch with Astra Sharma from Vanderbilt — the previous meeting had been the match-clinching victory for Vanderbilt. Olmos kicked it off with a 6-1 lead, but Sharma retired in the second set to send Olmos to the Round of 32. Olmos was the Women of Troy’s winningest singles player this season with a 38-13 overall record.
Though the Women of Troy did not take home the top prize from the NCAA Championships, they still had a successful season.
The team’s 25-3 record produced the most wins since the 1985 season, which is also the last time the Women of Troy entered the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 seed. The only difference between the two seasons is that the Women of Troy were the NCAA Champions back in 1985. This season marked the most wins for head coach Richard Gallien in his 20-year tenure with the program. USC was also undefeated at home this season.
In Pac-12 play, the Women of Troy went undefeated to capture the conference title. Their stellar play all season also earned them the top spot in the national rankings for the first time since 2003. The balanced combination of senior experience and freshmen talent came together to produce a memorable season for USC.
The program says goodbye to seniors Gabriella DeSimone and Casey Reede, as well as Santamaria and Scandalis. For DeSimone, Santamaria and Scandalis, the semifinal tournament appearance was their second, having reached that round in 2012 as freshmen.
With only four seniors leaving, there is still promise and potential for the Women of Troy to carry this season’s success onto the next.
Not only will the Women of Troy welcome a new freshmen class to carry on the program’s success, they will also welcome a new stadium for the 2016 season. The David X. Marks Tennis Stadium will be renovated to rival the top stadiums across the country and feature the Buntmann Family Tennis Center, which will welcome fans and display the rich history of success of USC tennis.
Hopefully the program will have a new Head Coach. Twenty years under Gallien produced three final fours only with two
of them #1 seeds. Getting shutout was not the way to go out of the tournament. The overall record means nothing with
winning a national title the goal for all schools. The Men have won 5 titles recently playing under the same conditions at
USC.

The Trojans will play in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005 after winning their final regular season baseball series against No. 16 Arizona State (34-19, 18-10). The Trojans’ overall record improves to 37-19 overall and 18-12 in conference play, their best record since 2001. The record was enough to tie for third place in the Pac-12 with ASU and California.
On Friday, the Trojans dropped the first game of the series to the Sun Devils, 11-3. Junior starter Kyle Davis gave up an early three-run home run to the Sun Devils before finishing his night with six strikeouts over six innings, with three walks on five hits.
Junior Timmy Robinson had a solo home run for the Trojans, as did senior Dante Flores. Flores went 2-for-3 on the night. The Trojans were able to pull within two runs behind the offense of Robinson and Flores, but the Sun Devils scored more runs off of three Trojan relievers and won, 11-3.
Flores’s bat was again key for the Trojans, as he led the team to a Game 2 win, 7-4. Flores hit a triple to clear the bases in the bottom of the seventh inning and fuel the Trojans to victory. Robinson and junior David Oppenheim each had two-run RBIs as well. Robinson also had a solo home run for the second-straight night.
The game was tied at two a piece in the bottom of the seventh inning when Flores’s triple gave the Trojans the lead. Senior Garrett Stubbs singled, sophomore Jeremy Martinez and Robinson each drew a walk, and Flores tripled to center field. The Trojans held on for the win to even the series 1-1.
Junior Bobby Stahel concluded his impressive offensive season with a three-run home run in the bottom of the fifth inning to lift the Trojans to a Game 3 win, 6-3, and to take the series. Stahel also had a big defensive play, as he made the last out in the top of the ninth with a diving grab.
Stubbs, who is a finalist for the Johnny Bench Award, caught two runners trying to steal to cap his senior season. Redshirt sophomore Reggie Southall and junior A.J. Ramirez got on base for Stahel, who gave the Trojans a 4-2 lead with a home run. The Trojans put two more runs on the board before the end of the game to win, 6-2.
The Trojans are the No. 2 seed in the Lake Elsinore Regional and will play No. 3 seed Virginia on Friday at 3 p.m. The game will be televised by ESPN. The host,     No. 1 UCSB, will play No. 4 San Diego State.

When Peony Sun, a class of 2015 Marshall School of Business graduate, asked her father how he felt about her being an entrepreneur, he said that he was in support as long as she was helping others.
Sun recognized this opportunity to help others while assisting her friend and fellow Marshall graduate, Sonya Chen’s, move last year.
“She couldn’t sell her apartment on the apartment lease group on Facebook or Craigslist,” Sun said.
The two students struggled to find someone to take over the lease, eventually locating a subleaser on a Chinese student association website. But, the process led them to realize that most of their success was due to luck and many students struggle with similar circumstances.
That is why Sun and Chen came up with the idea for Liradius or “Live in Radius,” a website dedicated to helping college students buy and sell items online.
“Our initial idea was that if you wanted to go to a place that is totally strange to you, then you could instantly find friends, furniture, apartments and even the most popular events at the place,” Sun said. “You’re adapting instantly.”
The name of the website is reflective of the goal that Sun has for students – to find everything they need within the “radius” of their university. The website also allows students to give and receive help within their own community of students.
The website functions like a hybrid of Craigslist and Freecycle.org, where students can post their items and apartments for sale or even give them away for free to other college students in their area.
“There’s a huge market for free stuff by international students,” Sun said. “When temporary visas expire [international students] have to get out fast — often throwing furniture pieces away instead of dealing with the hassle of putting it up on eBay or Craigslist.”
Currently on the website, desk lamps are one of the most common free items while bookshelves are selling for $15 with the option of having them delivered. In addition, Sun hopes to help students find a better way to sell their textbooks.
“You wouldn’t want to sell a book on Craigslist,” Sun said. “Nobody wants it except for college students. That’s the good thing about Liradius, having a ‘student-only’ environment. You get to know people and sell stuff faster.”
Networking and building friendships is another distinguishing factor that separates Liradius from other selling platforms. Sun emphasized the importance of helping students build social connections after realizing the difficulties international and exchange students face with making social connections when entering a new school.
“We figured, if you can trade your things on eBay, why not trade with your colleagues? That way you can get to know more people and build connections,” Sun said.
Sun believes that Facebook and other social networking sites, though updated with the latest events, are often exclusive to those who are “in the know” and require invitations that international and exchange students may not have access to when they first arrive to a new area. In addition, websites such as eBay charge people to sell their items, which is something that Sun does not agree with.
“Our primary goal is to serve all college students,” she said. “That means we are not going to charge them for transaction fees or membership costs.”
If the site succeeds, the team’s profit would mainly come from ad revenue.
In addition to Chen and Sun, three more USC graduates from the Marshall School and the School of Architecture have been part of creating the website. The five co-founders are united in their mission to create a website that can help all students.
“Despite all difficulties… and failures, what keeps our team together is our shared objective,” Sun said. “Our desire is to help enhance students’ college experiences through our platform by solving their problems or fulfilling needs. Our company will always prioritize the interests of college students and will not become a commercial tool solely for financial returns.”
The website is currently available at liradius.com with a full launch planned for August.

With the USC Village, the most expansive development project in the history of South Los Angeles, currently underway, the USC Alumni Real Estate Network discussed how the project will address the university’s growing need for residential housing.
AREN’s “Digging Deeper: A Real Estate Industry Look at USC Village,” event, held last Tuesday evening, gave the latest updates on the USC village and explored the project from a real estate industry perspective.
The event featured Laurie Stone, associate senior vice president for Real Estate and Asset Management at USC.  Stone kicked off the discussion by presenting the updated facts on USC’s real estate.  USC is currently comprised of two campuses: the University Park campus, set on about 292 acres, and the Health Sciences campus, which spans about 80 acres.
Stone also mentioned how USC is a huge economic driver for the city and the county. In 2008, students spent $503 million on goods and services and USC’s wage and payroll expenditures totaled $1 billion.
This economic impact has helped USC’s campus grow dramatically. One of the most important changes is that it has become a residential campus. No longer are students only coming in from Los Angeles, but many are coming from other states and even abroad.
“Now instead of students driving in on a daily basis, they are here living in the community,” Stone said. “One of the issues that that has been raised is that the university hadn’t built housing to accommodate that changing demographic in terms of students living close to campus.”
The USC Village aims to improve this housing situation at USC.
The process to getting the Village built was not an easy or quick one,” Stone said. “It was frankly a fairly painful process … This is something that has been in the works for a number of years.”
The project started off with a four-year planning process that was first internal to the campus. Faculty, staff and students were asked to identify what the needs for the campus were. Then, the university took that information and reached out to the community to understand what their interests were and how the university could interact with them.
Finally, they involved the city elected officials and government city departments to get the development going. The final plan allowed them to develop more than 5 million square feet over the course of the next 20 to 25 years, the majority of that being focused in the USC Village.
In order to be able to implement the plan, the university had to move into a public process with the city.  Three key documents had to be drafted: an environmental impact report, a plan for a public benefit package and a University Park specific plan that set forth the rules on how to develop the campus and the property around it.
In order to make sure that it moved forward, a development agreement was drafted between the university and the City of Los Angeles.
“[The City of Los Angeles] would vest our right to develop the campus and the areas around it … And in exchange for vesting that right, we agreed to a very significant community benefits package,” Stone said.
The package included direct payments to the City of Los Angeles and a series of indirect benefits including the construction of a new fire station, a full service grocery store in a new retail development and various community assistance programs, among others.
The Real Estate and Asset Management department faced several challenges when getting the project approved.  First, the historic fire station that was in place had to be demolished in order to go forth with the construction plan. This only happened after a complicated agreement with the City of Los Angeles in which USC promised to keep the historic parts of the fire station on site and rebuild another one offsite. Additionally, changes in design and architecture were a challenge that required years of submittals to the planning departments.
Finally, there was the issue of retail in a campus setting.  Since the Village will be a secure sight with gates, retailers will have to rely only on university business after public hours. Because it is a university project with only 12 percent of space allocated for retail, decisions were made for the housing plans that are not necessarily ideal for the retail space below.
When completed, USC Village will have nine new buildings totaling more than 1.25 million square feet that will include 466 parking spaces onsite, sit-down restaurants, a Trader Joe’s grocery store, a Bank of America, a bike shop, a Starbucks and other retailers.  With 2,700 new student beds, the village will give USC the ability to guarantee undergraduates housing for all four years and will open up spaces in other housing projects around campus for graduate students.
USC Village is expected to open in the fall of 2017.

President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Michael Quick headed a delegation of trustees, senior administrators and deans in Washington, D.C. to meet with a bipartisan committee of lawmakers.  The meeting, held in early April, was intended to address concerns regarding higher education, including a proposal for the White House to rate the nation’s post-secondary institutions.
President Barack Obama and his administration’s goal to combat the rising costs of a college education and to make education more affordable for students and their families includes a plan to introduce a new college rating system through the Department of Education.
In his annual address to faculty back in February, President Nikias discussed what he viewed as shortcomings in the proposed ratings system based on access, affordability and outcomes.
“None of these metrics reflect academic value or academic excellence,” Nikias said. “USC wins on outcomes and access, and we use a tremendous amount of resources to fund merit-based and need-based scholarships, to make USC education affordable … [The ratings system] may incentivize the wrong things.”
In February, USC and other members of the Association of American Universities, a nonprofit collective of public and private research universities, criticized the plan to draft a new rating system. In a letter to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, the AAU said that it would not endorse the “inappropriate” federal rating system. Though the AAU praised Obama’s efforts to make college more accessible and affordable, the institution claimed an official rating system — unlike the ones used by media organizations such as U.S. News and World Report — would contradict “the unbiased and authoritative image” of the federal government.
However, aside from a federal rating system, students often look to U.S. News and World Report which provides a widely recognized annual ranking. These rankings are based on 16 measures of quality that are divided into seven key areas, including factors such as undergraduate academic reputation, graduation and retention rates and financial resources. The unofficial rankings published by U.S. News and World Report rate the schools against each other, forming a numbered list of top schools, which is different from the rating system the federal government is proposing.
The proposed ratings system will not rate the schools against one another or provide a numbered list as U.S News and World Report does, but rather will seek to rate each school individually.
This year, USC ranked 25 in U.S. News’s ranking, down two spots from 2014. The latest report has raised doubts among college presidents across the nation, including Nikias, regarding the accuracy of U.S. News’s list in addition to other rating and ranking systems. Nikias spoke to the Washington Post in February about his belief that U.S. News’s calculations fail to factor in important aspects of colleges when compiling their ratings list, such as USC’s dedication to the arts.
“Sure, we pay attention to the rankings, because everyone looks at them,” Nikias told the Washington Post.
A study released by the American Educational Research Association shows that rankings published by U.S. News can influence where students apply to college as well. Holding a spot on the list’s top 25 can increase the amount of applications a school receives from 6 to 10 percent.
The White House’s current system of rating post-secondary institutions is operated through the Department of Education’s College Affordability and Transparency Center. The “College Scorecard” on the department’s website does not rank colleges against each other. The database provides information to students about colleges’ affordability and value, in alphabetical — rather than hierarchal — lists, by either searching for a specific institution or choosing from a variety of elements such as majors and location to narrow results.
According to the Department of Education, the push for the rating system by the Obama administration comes from the desire to strengthen the value of American college education and the federal government’s investment in student financial aid. The administration would additionally like to direct federal student aid money toward institutions with higher ratings.
“U.S. News welcomes Obama’s proposal for a new rating system and hopes the Department of Education makes more robust data on graduate career prospects and more accurate data on student debt loads available,” U.S. News chief data strategist Robert Morse wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Comments from the public and higher institutions such as the AAU were requested until February 17, when the Department of Education began to build a framework to revise the metrics and systems of their college databases, which will be available to the public in the 2015-2016 school year.
Claire Porter, a sophomore majoring in communication, said that she relied on her own research on USC’s social life, location and academic programs to make a final decision about where to attend college instead of using a ranking.
“I didn’t really need a ranking system to decide [on a university],” Porter said.
No wonder Max Nikias does not like ratings/rankings systems, except when they benefit his “New Academic Model”, and that’s not very often.
Since he took office, USC has fallen steadily in the ratings/rankings, almost across the board:
a. Marshall Business School is in danger of falling out of the TOP 30.
b. Gould is out of the top 20.
c. Rossier is out of the top 10
d. Social work is out of the top 10.
e. Roski Arts and Design is in freefall, with the entire 2016 Class having withdrawn! (Didn’t see this posted on the website.)
f. USC College is falling likewise, (tied @ 25/26). AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE SUPPOSED TO SURPASS OUR RIVALS! Two public schools have surpassed us: UCLA/Virginia.
g. Conversely, the cost of USC is # 9–congratulations, Max. TOP TEN!
Wow, where is the “Value” there?
In contrast, our rival across town costs half as much to attend and is ranked higher in nearly every category compared to us. More value?
You say it’s difficult to make forward motion in the academic rankings? It is, but both Duke and Univ. of Chicago have moved steadily and forcefully into the top ten and top five–where the going is the toughest. Needless to say, President Steven Sample was able to move us substantially with much fewer resources than are available to President Nikias.
Why are we falling so drastically? Following is the Max Nikias Legacy that has directly negatively impacted the quality of a USC education:
…He has stuffed 10,000 additional students into the university population immediately upon his arrival, without one word as to this immense change in business/academic policy; all the while adding no new beds or recreation facilities. After the fact, he is building University Village. But, the numbers do not work–adding 10,000 students and only 2,700 beds. We are now larger than most public universities and we receive no public funds other than for research.
…With all the successful fundraising, the Endowment has actually fallen on a Per Student Basis, (due to increased student population of 10,000). On a Per Student Basis, our endowment does not rank in the top 100 of US Higher Education.
…His programs of “Access” (10,000 new students) have only served to admit a lower percentage of qualified students to the point of having to establish an “Honors College” in order to attract the truly standout applicants. Of course, they all pay the same, regardless of their qualifications.
…Our main High School feeders are now low scoring local schools (Foshay, etc.) along with Cal State Dominguez Hills serving as our main transfer school. We take tons of transfers–another new Nikias policy concerning increased “Access” and lowered standards.
…We have to accept 9,000 students to fill 3,000 spots–, a take-up rate of 33.3%. Elite schools have this number flipped where 70% accept the invitation to matriculate. This may be the most damning statistic of all showing how little progress Nikias has made towards making USC into an Elite School. High School College Counselors still rate USC @ 4.3 out of 5 possible points for “Quality of Education”. Again, Elite schools rate 4.9-5.0. I wonder where the elite students attend? Not hard to see why.
…He has expanded on-line education to the point where you can now get a USC undergraduate degree without ever stepping foot into the USA. Of course, the real point of this is to raise money while lowering the cost of a USC education (across the board) for the ratings gurus. On-line education is cheaper than off-line: It skews the overall  “Cost of a USC Education” numbers in our favor, while raising a ton of money. Who does this really serve besides a few graduate students and professionals who don’t live in L.A.?  (More access to USC).
…While our NCAA athletes have some of the best facilities in the world, the remaining 98% of the Student Population (41,000) have facilities that are more fit for a high school about a quarter of our size. Try getting onto an athletic field without a reservation–locals have the same priority as the students. Don’t believe me, go down to campus one weekend and see who is using the athletic fields, while paying students  sit around and wait their turn.
IN CONCLUSION:
… President Nikias preaches the “Value” of a USC diploma while undercutting it’s value in nearly every way. We now issue over 15,000 sheepskins/year. As am employer/Alumnus, I see more and more USC graduates with lower and lower qualifications. USC cannot be everything to everyone, as much as Nikias is trying to make it that. I honestly think he is much better suited to leading a public university and not our USC. The facts bear me out.
Keep it pithy and people will pay attention. 
I agree with a lot of what you wrote. I do notice SC slipping in terms of “prestige.” Nikias is watering down/selling out SC’s identity; he’s discounting its substance in order to appeal to everyone. Sample, on the other hand, did an awesome job; I went during his era. He rebuilt SC from being an academically complacent school that only focused on football and “connections” to at least meeting our rival across town in academic rankings, admit-rate, et al. 
Sample followed the proverbial “leave while you’re still on top.” Nikias is floundering with what Sample passed to him….Caltech recently got a new president, and he was the former president of U Chicago. I think Caltech’s admin was wise to choose someone with a lot of experience from a commensurate school…SC should’ve done likewise; promoting from within isn’t always the wisest thing. Oh well, I guess SC will revert to the 90s……when UCLA surpassed us academically and beat us in football.
Fight on *with trepidation*
