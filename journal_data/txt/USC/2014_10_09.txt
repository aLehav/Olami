Models of Pride, a free annual conference focused on issues relating to LGBTQ youth, will be held on campus this Saturday.

“The conference is designed for LGBTQ youth to be a day of empowerment, of personal development and helping them see themselves as leaders both for their own lives and also the LGBTQ community as whole,” said Kevin McCloskey, the program operations manager of the conference coordinator, LifeWorks.
Now in its 22nd year, Models of Pride will host a string of activities and engagements aimed to foster a greater sense of community and awareness among LGBTQ youth in the Los Angeles area.
Events will include an entertainment hour marked by celebrities such as Alex Newell from Glee, more than 100 workshops for students and parents, as well as a college and resource fair. Lunch and dinner will also be served, as well as a dance at night. Nearly 2,000 people are expected to attend Saturday’s festivities, with more than 1,200 being youth of ages 24 and under.
The free conference is funded primarily through private sponsors such as Toyota and USC, the latter of which donated $10,000, according to Rev. Kelby Harrison, director of the USC LGBT Resource Center.
The conference has been held on USC’s campus since 2010, and McCloskey cited the university’s support as both a sponsor and host as indicative of the school’s commitment to being a premier option for LGBTQ students.
“I think USC wants to be known as a place that is a welcoming place for LGBTQ students and is a safe place and diverse place, and this conference is a good way to make that statement.”
The conference is also utilizing USC personnel resources, primarily the LGBT Resource Center and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly.
Harrison explained that the center is the conference’s on-campus partnering office and helps with facilities scheduling and university facility rentals for Models of Pride. The conference’s event will be held in various buildings throughout the campus, including Bovard Auditorium, Taper Hall of Humanities, Tutor Campus Center and Von KleinSmid Center.
QuASA students members will be stationed throughout campus to help attendees locate specific event and workshops.
“Our role is to help them out with guiding people at the conference — we’re [serving] as USC ambassadors,” said Dylan Lee, assistant director of QuASA.
The conference was created in 1993 as the brainchild of the Gay and Lesbian Education Commission of the Los Angeles Unified School District, and LifeWorks, the youth development and mentoring program of the L.A. LGBT Center, assumed hosting in 2010.
Now in its fourth year at USC, McCloskey stressed the conference’s motive to serve ultimately as a means of youth empowerment.
“I want people to feel less alone after being part of this conference. I want them to feel bigger, part of a community, to feel empowered to live their best life and be a part of making our world a bigger and better place for all people, and especially those who identify as LGBTQ,” he said.

The late Fred Ross Sr., a USC alumnus and social justice advocate, was inducted into the California Hall of Fame at the California Museum in Sacramento on Oct. 1.

Other honorees at the ceremony, which was the eighth such induction, included director Francis Ford Coppola, basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and musician and producer Andre “Dr. Dre” Young.
A less famous, yet equally impressive inductee, Fred Ross Sr., who passed away in 1992, was also recognized by California Gov. Jerry Brown. A grassroots organizer and champion of social justice, Ross dedicated his life to being in the background of more prominent activists.
Ross attained tremendous success on numerous fronts, including organizing Dust Bowl refugees, restructuring migratory labor camps in California, laying the groundwork for the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case, founding the Community Service Organization, instructing César Chavez and Dolores Huerta in social and political reform strategies and working tirelessly with the United Farm Workers Union.
Friends and family say that Ross’s humility kept him out of the press, but this lack of recognition does not reflect his influence on the world.
For him it wasn’t about glory or recognition,” said his son, Fred Ross Jr. “It’s extraordinary that Gov. Brown recognized him. He was probably one of the least known members of his class. He was behind the scenes. He was all about developing and he got tremendous satisfaction from doing it.”
When reminiscing on his time spent at USC, Fred Ross Sr. always mentioned his first encounter with social justice activism: a Mexican farmworkers’ strike in Orange County that he and several other USC students attended. There, he and other USC students witnessed police brutality against the strikers — brutality that hit close to home when they were surprised to find other USC students there in opposition to the strikers.
After graduation, he took a job managing a California labor camp, where he took unprecedented initiative to organize workers in order to attain a higher degree of self-governance.
Voter registration and civic engagement became a cornerstone of Ross’ endeavors. In his later attempts to gain the trust of a skeptical César Chavez, Fred Ross Sr. would have to prove his passion and commitment. Ross painted a picture of hope for Chavez, citing his triumph with the Los Angeles City Council campaign in 1947. In organizing a massive voter registration operation and training thousands of grassroots organizers, Ross managed to register over 15,000 constituents. These efforts led to the election of Ed Roybal, the first Hispanic councilmember.
“It was his calling to devote himself to fighting injustice,” Ross Jr. said. “He believed the best way to do that was to organize people in underrepresented communities.”
Chavez eventually found confidence in Ross, whom he later called upon in founding the United Farm Workers Association. After he trained 2,000 community organizers, the group would go on to catalyze the 1975 California Agricultural Labor Relations Act by utilizing Ross’s strategies for successful activism.
These efforts faced myriad impediments because, though he flew under the radar, people could recognize that Ross Sr. was a force to be reckoned with. When spearheading the Civic Unity Leagues in the Citrus Belt around 1947, the activist was followed by the FBI, as he was confronting issues like police brutality and segregation, which profoundly plagued southern California. Despite opposition, reforms were enacted, and the movement managed to get the first Latino school board representative elected.
His son remembers his father’s perseverance fondly.
“In the aftermath of the Proposition 187, I remembered my father’s advice, No hay mal que por bien no venga,” Ross Jr. said. The phrase is a Spanish rendition of every cloud has a silver lining.
“I took that saying to heart,” Ross Jr. said. “As we did research, we found that in Los Angeles County alone, in 1994 there were a million legal residents. They were eligible to become voters and citizens. We came up with the Active Citizenship Campaign that taught people how to become citizens and become engaged in the community.”
Their patience and dedication achieved significant results. These new U.S. citizens were consequently able to vote in the 1996 elections and, being trained by Ross Sr., subsequently organized a march protesting the bureaucracy of Immigration and Naturalization Services.
Their endeavors were so successful that, after meeting with then Vice President Al Gore, the wait of citizenship applications got reduced from three years to six months — a standard still extant today. Ross Jr. continues to be inspired by his father’s actions in his own life.
“The fight for social and economic justice is a lifetime fight, and multigenerational fight,” he said. “You’re going to have setbacks.”
When asked about the greatest challenge his father faced, Ross Jr. asserted that it was inspiring a new generation of leaders to stay with it for the long haul.
”There are no shortcuts because they lead to dead ends,” he said.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, in partnership with Visions and Voices, held an event titled “Voices of South L.A.” on Thursday night in Annenberg Auditorium.
Coming together · Panelists discussed the importance of USC students engaging with the surrounding community at the Voices of South L.A. event, which took place Thursday evening in the Annenberg Auditorium. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
The panel discussion centered on the comprehensive model for change that various activists and USC individuals have tried to implement in and around South Los Angeles to promote economic and social improvement.
Featured in the panel were the voices of Erin Aubry Kaplan, a chronicler of African American life in Los Angeles; Francisco Ortega, policy advisor to the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission; Alberto Retana, executive vice president at Community Coalition; and Sahra Sulaiman, a documentary photographer and researcher for Streetsblog LA.
The panelists have taken significant action around the L.A. community, working to improve the conditions of the neighborhood by creating and working for various initiatives.
Ortega explained that students must understand the importance of transitioning their current perspectives on the individuals who live in the surrounding area. He also said that students must replace their current lack of interaction with the natives of the area by taking strides to treat them as neighbors, rather than strangers.
“South L.A. needs its people, its community to understand that they have the power,” Ortega said.
Ortega posed a pivotal question to the audience, asking how South Los Angeles can use the power of the people to act as a transformative agent for greater reform. He commented on how difficult it is to achieve change among residents of the neighborhood.
“But how do we tap into that power if most of the people in South L.A. are afraid of crime, are afraid to walk around, are afraid to play in the streets, are afraid to come out, are afraid to engage to meet with people or to organize?” Ortega asked.
Sulaiman began by stating the importance of communal respect in Los Angeles. She reiterated the lack of empathy among those who try to understand the complexities of the South L.A. residents.
“You have to respect the knowledge of the people in the community — who they are, who they represent and how they’ve been there,” Sulaiman said.
She also spoke about the disconnect within the community, urging students to lay a foundation of trust in order to foster communication between themselves and the surrounding residents.
Kaplan commented on the misconceived notion of perception in the community.
“There is a struggle for both the people who live in the community and those who are not from the community to perceive themselves in a way that can make tangible change,” Kaplan said.
Ortega posed a question to the audience which transitioned the focus of reform in South Los Angeles to a difference in attitudes.
“Are you looking at this [issue of poverty and injustice in South Los Angeles] as disparity or equity?” Ortega asked. “Disparity just means there is difference.”
He also said that activism required a greater commitment in order to truly bring about change.
“Are we building a movement or are we just contributing to charity? You must ask yourselves if you are really trying to change the equation,” Ortega said.
Dayna Grundy, a sophomore majoring in human biology, enjoyed how the event focused on community interaction.
“It was a great place where a community of students and advocates came together to discuss possible problems and solutions in Los Angeles,” Grundy said.
Ortega commented on the impact the event will hopefully have on USC students.
“Today’s event is important in bridging the South L.A. community with one of its most beloved neighbors, USC,” Ortega said.
Voices of South L.A. is one in a three-part series of events including Food, Recreation and the Arts as Social Justice and the South Los Angeles Walking Tour.

Coming off a 14-5 victory over then-No. 5 UC Santa Barbara in its first home game of the season Oct. 4, the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team will head across town to UCLA for the SoCal Tournament this weekend, aiming to avenge the Trojans’ only two losses on the year.
USC enters the tournament 12-2 on the season, having been dealt its two defeats by then-No. 2 UCLA and then-No. 34 Cal at the Kap7 NorCal Classic last month. The Trojans will play Air Force followed by either UCSB or Pepperdine Oct. 11, all of whom the Trojans have defeated at least once this season. If they’re able to clear these teams again the first day, the Trojans could potentially meet UCLA or Cal in the semifinals or finals of the tournament on Oct. 12.
With the possibility of facing the 14-1 Bears or the 15-0 Bruins again this weekend, USC head coach Jovan Vavic will look for his team to have made adjustments for the tournament. The Trojans were defeated by narrow margins in both games — falling 9-7 to the Bruins and 11-10 to the Bears — Vavic emphasized the importance of the shutting the door in the closing stages of the game.
“We’ve got to play better at the end,” he said. “Against UCLA we had a one-goal lead and we made too many careless passes at the end of the game — we just started to turn the ball over. When the game was still in anybody’s hands we missed a wide-open counterattack, we made a bad pass, and the next counterattack, they scored a goal. Things like that are what kill you.”
In their battle last Saturday against the Gauchos, the Trojans broke away early and had no trouble closing out the game, taking over the lead after UCSB scored the first goal and never looking back. The 12-time National Coach of the Year liked what he saw from his team in its last game before the tournament.
“I thought we played with lots of energy,” Vavic said. “We started the game with a 6-1 lead and we created quite a few opportunities by countering on almost every possession. So the energy was really great, our defense was excellent in the first half, we gave up only two goals, and it was great to see that nine different people scored a goal.”
Senior driver Kostas Genidounias, the Trojans’ top scorer of the 2014 campaign with 44 goals so far, led the Trojans in scoring with a hat trick Saturday, but the team’s performance on the defensive side of the ball is what Genidounias believes will make or break the Trojans if they’re to rematch Cal or UCLA this weekend.
“We just have to make more stops,” Genidounias said. “We allowed 20 goals in total in those two games — nine [goals] and 11 [goals]. We need to get that number way lower than 20. We have the offense, we just didn’t have the defense in those games, so we just have to play some really tough defense.”
One difference in the Trojan squad this weekend from the NorCal Classic will be the presence of sophomore driver Nick Bell, who made his season debut for the team Saturday against the Gauchos after a back injury forced him to miss the first 11 games of the year.
“It felt great to be back,” Bell said. “I’ve been waiting, I’ve been out for seven weeks now and it’s been killing me to get back in the water.”
Faced with the prospect of going up against UCLA’s top scorers Alex Roelse and Cristiano Mirarchi, who have notched 25 goals apiece on the year, Bell reiterated the need for the Trojans to be on-point defensively this weekend.
“Our defensive game could definitely be stepped up,” Bell said. “Defense is going to be very important [this weekend]. We stressed defensive counterattack and frontcourt defense [in practice]. Those are our biggest objectives for the games, and those are going to be the key in limiting the other teams’ goals.”

After a bittersweet weekend in which they followed up a tough 1-0 loss to Colorado with a 2-0 victory over Utah, the Women of Troy now face their most challenging weekend of the season.
Tough D · After sitting out her first two seasons due to injury, redshirt sophomore defender Dominique Randle has not allowed a goal this year. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
USC (8-2-2, 2-1-0 Pac-12) will host the No. 21 California Bears Friday before playing host to the No. 3 Stanford Cardinal. As a team with the goal of making it to postseason this year, the Women of Troy know the importance of the upcoming weekend.
To prepare, the Women of Troy spent the week in practice focusing on improvements on both sides of the ball.
“Tuesday was a lot about building our defensive pressure, figuring out how we move together and making sure we weren’t getting separated or clustered into groups,” USC head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “Wednesday was about staying in rhythm offensively, and I thought we did pretty good. We didn’t get enough shots on frame Friday, even though I thought that our movement towards the frame was good. Thursday was mostly fine-tuning set pieces and making sure we are going into the weekend feeling good about ourselves.”
The team will have its first opportunity to showcase its hard work Friday against Cal, who will be led by two double-digit point scorers in midfielder Taylor Comeau (7 goals, 5 assists) and midfielder Kelly Fitzgerald (5 goals). Cal will enter the match with a record of 9-3-0, but after losing two consecutive conference games this past weekend — 1-0 to Washington State on Friday and 2-1 to Washington Sunday — they will undoubtedly be looking for a bounce-back performance of their own against USC.
“Cal is hungry,” McAlpine said. “They are coming off a tough weekend, and we are going to get their best shot Friday.”
After battling with the Bears Friday, the Women of Troy will need to make a quick turnaround for their game Sunday when the Stanford Cardinal will come to town looking to continue their undefeated play this season. At 10-0-2, the only hiccups of the season thus far were ties with then-No. 25 Notre Dame on Sept. 7 (0-0, 2OT) and with Utah on Sept. 26 (1-1, 2OT). Stanford will be coming off a huge Thursday night matchup with No. 1 UCLA, which will likely determine who finishes atop the Pac-12 standings at the end of the season.
Stanford will present the most difficult challenge to date for the Women of Troy. With 26 goals in their first 12 games, led by forward Ryan Walker-Hartshorn, who has put in eight in the back of the net so far this year. The biggest obstacle posed by the Cardinal, however, is its airtight defense. Stanford leads the nation in goals-against average at .159, having allowed just two goals in 12 games. The Women of Troy, currently ranked 10th in scoring offense with 2.83 goals per game, will look to buck this trend and uproot the Cardinal defense.
Though this weekend will provide some serious challenges for the Women of Troy, senior captain and goalie Caroline Stanley is confident that the team will be ready to go.
“Nobody on our team is scared,” she said. “It’s all about our mentality. It’s about being aggressive and going out and taking control of the game.”
Both games will be played at McAlister Field and broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks. The Friday matchup with Cal kicks off at noon, while the Sunday showdown with Stanford will begin at 3 p.m.
“If you want to see good, exciting, high-level soccer, this is the weekend to do it,” McAlpine said. “Both games are can’t-miss games. There will be plenty of great athletes and soccer players representing a variety of national teams as well as the Pac-12 Conference. It’s going to be a fun weekend.”

USC’s football team has a long history of vaunted defensive players.
Ronnie Lott. Junior Seau. Willie McGinest. Troy Polamalu. Clay Matthews III.
And last year, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden argued that now-junior defensive end Leonard Williams belonged in that mix. Haden tweeted, “I have been around USC for over 40 years… Leonard is one of the top 5 players I have seen. He is that good.”
Indeed, the Daytona Beach, Florida, native has been tearing it up since he got to USC in 2012. Last year, Williams became known as one of the best defensive players in the country. Williams played the whole season with a torn labrum and still racked up 74 total tackles and six sacks, wreaking havoc on opposing offenses.
His standout season earned him a spot on five preseason award watchlists, including the Nagurski Trophy (top defensive player), the Bednarik Award (top defensive player) and the Lombardi Award (top lineman/linebacker).
But Williams has been having a relatively quiet season so far. He came up big in USC’s upset of Stanford, including a sack of quarterback Tyler Hogan when the Cardinal were knocking on the door, but has been a nonfactor in most other games.
Sophomore Su’a Cravens has been USC’s breakout player on defense this season, flourishing in a safety-Sam linebacker hybrid role. Williams, who entered the season amid rumors of being a Top-5 pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, might be suffering in the new defensive system. The Trojans just don’t produce sacks like they used to — USC’s eight sacks on the season is tied for 96th in the nation. Still, Williams is a team captain and one of the leaders of the defense, and will be key in calming the storm going forward.
This week at practice, defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox begrudgingly characterized USC’s defense as “schizophrenic.” Indeed, USC’s defense went from holding Stanford to 10 points to giving up 452 rush yards to Boston College and 510 pass yards to Arizona State. This can be partially blamed on the coaching staff, as many have argued, but can also be fixed in part by USC’s leaders on defense, like Williams, taking control.
Williams said at Pac-12 Media Day that he was just beginning to grow into his leadership position and that he was more likely to lead by example than to get on his teammates’ cases for missing tackles. But though Williams might be the headliner of the defense, he’s not alone out there.
Linebacker Hayes Pullard, a fifth-year senior, has long been the Trojans’ emotional leader on defense. When he was ejected from USC’s game at Stanford after incurring a targeting penalty, it seemed that the Trojans rallied to replace their captain. Trojan fans wanted to believe that once Pullard entered in the second half of the BC game, it would immediately uplift the team and turn around the disastrous performance, but that fairy tale ending didn’t quite work out.
With suspended senior defensive back Josh Shaw’s status still up in the air, Williams and Pullard need to take command of the defense, and Saturday’s matchup at Arizona is the perfect opportunity to do that.

The desert will be rocking on Saturday night when the USC Trojans take on one of the hottest teams in the country, the Arizona Wildcats. The No. 10 Wildcats (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) made their season debut in the AP poll this week, riding a wave of momentum after a stunning upset of then-No. 2 Oregon last Thursday. The Trojans (3-2, 2-1) are in an entirely different position, having dropped out of the national rankings after a last-second loss to Arizona State. Amid questions about his and defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s play-calling abilities, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian is confident in his team’s ability to compete going forward.

“I’m always impressed by this team’s ability to respond to the things that we ask of them,” Sarkisian said. “They came right back to work and just battled and competed. We’ve made a huge point of emphasis this week on winning our one-on-one battles. The focus on the attention to details was tremendous.”
The Wildcats have seemingly emerged from out of nowhere to become the Pac-12’s highest-ranked team. After an undefeated — yet somewhat unimpressive — nonconference slate, the team has turned the college football world upside down in its first two Pac-12 games. First came an improbable last-second Hail Mary from quarterback Anu Solomon to wideout Austin Hill to beat California late last month, a sour reminder for Trojan fans of the two teams’ dichotomous seasons. Then came the upset of Oregon two weeks later, sealed with a strip-sack from linebacker Scooby Wright.
The Wildcats’ potent offense has been responsible for much of this success, with the redshirt freshman Solomon leading the way. The Honolulu native has quietly grown into one of the conference’s best at his position, averaging 348.2 yards per game through the air with 14 touchdowns against only four interceptions.
“Anu’s a heck of a player,” Sarkisian said. “He can really throw it, which is different than they had in [last year’s quarterback] B.J. Denker. He’s much more of a thrower than a runner, but when he does run it, he’s effective.”
On the ground, the Wildcats are powered by the two-headed monster of Nick Wilson and Terris Jones-Grigsby. Wilson is the Pac-12’s second-leading rusher with 574 yards, just two behind USC redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen. Jones-Grigsby has scored a touchdown in each of his three appearances this season, averaging 5.9 yards per carry along the way. The pair have effectively filled the void left by record-breaking running back Ka’Deem Carey, who raced to 138 yards against the Trojans last year on his way to a Pac-12-best 1885 yards.
USC sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens and the rest of the Trojans’ defensive unit will be tasked with stopping an athletic, multi-faceted attack. Cravens, who leads his team with 8.5 tackles for loss, has been impressed with what he has seen of the Wildcats on film.
“They’re fast, they’re really fast,” Cravens said. “They don’t run as many plays as Arizona State does, but they get you tired, and when you’re tired you can’t really keep up with the tempo as such. Their plays rely on our mistakes, so those big yards that they gain, those points they put up are really from defenses getting tired and making mistakes, which is what they gameplan for.”
Sarkisian admitted that given Arizona head coach Rich Rodriguez’s complex offensive scheme, the Wildcats are a tough team to stop.
“Arizona is very unique,” Sarkisian said. “They really call a run play and a pass play on every down, and the quarterback has a decision whether to hand it off or to throw it. I think Rich [Rodriguez] is a tremendous coach; he’s one of the pioneers of the spread offense and does a great job of executing it and then implementing it on gameday.”
Allen and the USC offense will aim to keep the quick-striking Wildcats off the field, a goal that history says the team should be able to accomplish. The Trojans kept the ball for 37:18 of last Saturday’s loss to ASU, winning the time of possession battle by more than 14 minutes. Allen’s hard running, coupled with redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler’s efficiency, has given USC the time of possession edge in three of the team’s five games this season.
The Trojans will line up against a talented, if inconsistent, Arizona defense. Wright, the co-Pac-12 leader with 58 tackles, anchors a front seven that put constant pressure on Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota, especially late in the game, while holding the Ducks to just 144 total rushing yards. Sarkisian knows that any unit that can limit the high-flying Oregon offense is no slouch.
“I think what they did really good against Oregon last week was they won on first down,” Sarkisian said. “They put Oregon into some second-and-longs and then third-and-longs. I think that’ll be important for us here going into Tucson [Arizona] on Saturday night: first down efficiency on offense.”
USC leads the all-time record against Arizona 29-8, but lost a 39-36 shootout on its last trip to Arizona Stadium in 2012. All-American junior defensive end Leonard Williams, a freshman on that team, remembers the game well.
“Freshman year, we went up there and we lost,” Williams said. “We were 10th in the nation and they beat us. [But] we have a whole different coaching staff, new players, new weapons.”
Interestingly, all of these two teams’ last seven meetings have been decided by a touchdown or less. This Saturday’s duel kicks off at 7:30 p.m. PT.

Count Dracula has an image problem that has nothing to do with mirrors.
Prince Charming of Darkness · Luke Evans plays a sympathetic version of Vlad the Impaler fighting for the fate of his people in Gary Shore’s fantasy epic Dracula Untold, opening in theaters this weekend. – Photo courtesy of Universal Studios
 
Dracula Untold, the action-horror hybrid swooping into theaters this weekend, is the latest attempt to recast Bram Stoker’s deathless creation as a flawed, romantic hero who transforms himself into a tragic monster for the sake of his loved ones. The film, the feature-length debut of director Gary Shore, centers on Prince Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans), better known as Vlad the Impaler, who enters into a Faustian bargain with an undead sorcerer named Caligula (Charles Dance from Game of Thrones, channeling Max Schreck in F.W. Murnau’s original Nosferatu) in order to gain the dark and terrible powers necessary to save his people, especially his young son Ingeras (Art Parkinson, also of Game of Thrones), from being conscripted into the army of the tyrannical Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper).
Why do so many screenwriters feel the need to retroactively burden classic villains with sympathetic backstories? Are we truly better off knowing that Darth Vader used to be a whiny little control freak who enjoyed waxing poetic about the texture of sand? Did we really need to watch a teenage Hannibal Lecter vengefully embrace the act of cannibalism after Nazi soldiers deceive him into eating the remains of his younger sister in the sadly misguided prequel Hannibal Rising? Part of the reason Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight is so terrifying is because there’s simply no accounting for him. We know next to nothing about him, and that makes him seem capable of anything and everything.
Then there’s the matter of general appearances. Compare the noble, hunky visage of Evans’ Dracula to this description of the character from Stoker’s novel, originally published in 1897: “His face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils, with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth.” He’s also described as having curved, rotted fingernails and strange patches of hair growing out of his palms.
The Count, who has been portrayed by more actors than any other literary creation, narrowly beating out Sherlock Holmes, is about as far from male-model material as one can get, yet with a few notable exceptions (Christopher Lee’s demonic savage, Klaus Kinski’s mournful ghoul), the vast majority of onscreen Draculas have been handsome, eloquent and supernaturally charming, most of them taking their cues from the legendary Bela Lugosi, who played the vampire king as a smooth, seductive apex predator. The closest we’ve seen to a faithful physical rendition is Gary Oldman’s chalk-skinned, red-robed human leech in Francis Ford Coppola’s Dracula, even though he’s eventually revealed as an age-swapping Casanova searching for the reincarnation of his lost love (Winona Ryder).
Dracula Untold and its humanizing take on the Count wouldn’t be so troubling if the film didn’t also represent the unofficial beginning of Universal’s long-rumored reboot of their Classic Monsters lineup, which is being overseen by Star Trek co-screenwriter Alex Kurtzman, who recently broke with longtime writing partner Roberto Orci, and Fast and Furious 6 scribe Chris Morgan.
In the wake of Disney’s gargantuan success with The Avengers and its other interconnected Marvel properties, nearly every other major Hollywood studio appears to have come down with shared universe fever. Sony has its Spider-Man series building towards director Drew Goddard’s super-villain team-up The Sinister Six (there have also been rumors suggesting the studio is mulling over the possibility of working with Disney so everyone’s favorite wall-crawler can appear in future Avengers sequels, though doing so might hasten Andrew Garfield’s departure from the Peter Parker role), while 20th Century Fox has announced its desire to develop crossover events between its X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises (the currently in-development Deadpool movie would also be in the mix).
Universal, meanwhile, doesn’t have access to a giant roster of superheroes. What it does have, however, is the world’s greatest catalogue of vintage horror movies, all featuring genre heavyweights such as Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, his beautiful Bride, the Wolf-Man, the Mummy, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, the Invisible Man, the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Phantom of the Opera.
A cohesive cinematic universe featuring these horror icons interacting with each other would be rife with creative and monetary potential. In order for Universal’s grand plans to come to fruition, though, Dracula Untold needs to do well in theaters. It’s already pulled down a solid $21 million in select foreign markets (including a stellar $5 million four-day opening in Mexico), but it will have to be a massive hit stateside to make up for its relatively steep $100 million budget.
All this talk of Universal Monsters sharing the screen together can’t help but bring to mind one of the finest horror comedies of all time, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, where the comedic duo Bud Abbott and Lou Costello play a pair of hapless baggage clerks who run afoul of Frankenstein’s Monster (Glenn Strange subbing in for Boris Karloff), Dracula (Lugosi) and the Wolf-Man (the always game Lon Chaney Jr.). The 1948 film, directed by Charles Barton, strikes a near-perfect balance between scares and laughs and still holds up remarkably well today.
The film is also responsible for one of the most flawlessly timed exchanges in cinematic history when Chaney’s perpetually doomed lycanthrope Lawrence Talbot begs Costello to lock him in his room, saying, “Every night when the moon is full, I turn into a wolf!” Costello’s deadpan response: “Yeah, you and 20 million other guys.”
Could there be a comedic side to this nascent cinematic universe? If so, Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost should be called in immediately. Shaun of the Dead beats Luke Evans and his CGI bat army any day of the week.

As the former University Village sits as an empty construction site, a new café is trying to fill the the void left by its absence.
Smile on! · Located next to the Catholic Center, Smiles’ offers a quiet location, sunny outside seating, and good coffee and paninis on the menu. – Priscilla Chu | Daily Trojan
Right next to the pedestrian path from campus to University Avenue, Smiles’ Café serves as an improvement from the old restaurants the UV used to offer. A quaint coffee shop located at 844 W. 32nd St., adjacent to USC’s Caruso Catholic Center, Smiles’ Café is located only a short block away from campus.
It offers a number of spacious desks and tables that are perfect for enjoying a pastry or coffee while studying for midterms. They also serve paninis, various drinks, prepackaged salads and snacks.
The food is also reasonably priced. A $5 panini will definitely fill up any hungry student and serves as a proper alternative for other options at USC.
Location-wise, the café is secluded enough to offer private space for the most intense studying sessions. Yet, it is central enough to USC students that it offers a great place for a coffee pick-me-up or wake-up. Adjacent to the Catholic Center, the outside seating offers a great view of the center’s beautiful grounds. It provides an environment that is aesthetically pleasing with its greenery and buildings.
Smiles’ Café’s favorable hours (9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday through Friday) also suggest that this is the perfect spot for a quick iced coffee on the way to class. Be wary, though, that around lunchtime the wait can be long because only two employees run the counter. Yet, the employees are extremely courteous and friendly. With 10 guests waiting in line, they efficiently create your paninis while also taking to the time to ask how your day was. With great customer service, the café has a bright future in crafting positive relationships with USC students.
But it’s not all smiles when it comes to the food. The salads are prepackaged and not the freshest. I would instead recommend the paninis. These sandwiches are popular among guests, and the small café also draws more than just USC students.
With a diverse customer base, it offers a nice setting outside of the USC bubble. Though the hours aren’t favorable for late-night studying, this café offers ample amounts of outlets, proper AC and lots of table space for the midday homework session.
In comparison to Trojan Grounds, Cups or Coffee Bean, Smiles’ Café is a quick alternative. The lines are not as long, and prices run a little cheaper. But what makes this eatery special is its location. I would recommend coming here if you need a little space and time off campus. TroGro is crowded all the time. Coffee Bean rarely has open seats. And Cups is not central in relation to where students walk. Smiles’ Café offers a place where you can actually get work done without going out of your way.
Smiles’ Café offers a great place for a relatively cheap caffeine fix with a friendly wait staff — a perfect place for you to park your laptop and study within peaceful surroundings. They have encouraging posters on their walls, and their cheeky slogan “Smile On!” encourages students to truly enjoy the sun-drenched porch. Also, because this side of campus no longer hosts food options, this newly opened café could soon be the new coffee place. Smile on!

Have you ever just had a really bad day? If you have, 11-year-old Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) knows exactly how you feel. Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is a charming family comedy directed by Miguel Arteta (The Good Girl), which revolves around Alexander Cooper, whose seemingly perfect family has little sympathy for his all-too-frequent bad days; that is, until the tables turn and the other members of the Cooper family embark on very bad days of their own. Adapted from the wildly popular 1972 children’s book of the same name by Judith Viorst, this film reminds us of the importance of family and camaraderie when things begin to go very wrong.
Classic style · Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day captures the spirit of Disney classics such as Freaky Friday and The Parent Trap with a great performance from the young Ed Oxenbould. – Photo courtesy of Disney Studios
 
As we watch dad Ben Cooper (Steve Carell) attempt to land a job at a trendy video game design company while keeping an eye on his impish baby, mom Kelly (Jennifer Garner) is navigating a workplace disaster when the children’s book her company is publishing is sent to shops with a hilarious misprint. Meanwhile, high school junior Anthony (Dylan Minnette) struggles with his high maintenance girlfriend (Bella Thorne) during the days leading up to prom, and sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) wakes up with a head cold on the opening night of her starring role in Peter Pan. All of this goes on while Alexander’s all-important 12th birthday is nearly forgotten in the chaos.
This newest release from Disney might not initially seem to be a must-see; it’s marketed as a family film and seems like something you would have enjoyed about 10 years ago. But that’s exactly why audiences should see it. Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day will have you thinking back to the Disney classic live action comedies from the ’90s. It’s not a far cry from The Parent Trap, Father of the Bride and Freaky Friday, movies that sent family members of all ages into fits of laughter. Minnette agreed, saying that this movie reminds him of “the kind of movies that I grew up with.” The humor is gentle enough to appease cautious parents but offers a good sprinkling of innuendos, adult references and Australian strippers to avoid putting young adults to sleep. The general definition of a family film has shifted from a film whose content will only be appreciated by pre-teens, but this film is bringing back the original style of the genre. In fact, Arteta took his main inspiration for the film not from other family comedies, but from John Hughes’ famous adolescent dramas. He explained that the movies Sixteen Candles and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off in particular shaped his approach to the movie, as he wanted to encapsulate both the frenetic atmosphere and caring family values that these films portrayed.
Alexander certainly should be a hit with families considering the star power behind its production. Arteta teamed up with veteran producers Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum and Date Night), Lisa Henson (Good Boy!) and Dan Levine (The Internship). Production designer Michael Corenblith brings all the warmth and vibrant colors of Saving Mr. Banks, and Arteta strikes just the right balance of comedy to keep up the pace and warmth to keep the audience invested in the characters.
In addition, the fantastic chemistry between the actors makes for an endearing movie. Carell and Garner are both hilarious and relatable as the two frantic parents of a large family trying to juggle parenting and their careers, while Minnette and Dorsey provide two very different but equally hilarious teenagers of the modern age. Arguably, the most prominent star is Oxenbould, the Australian boy cast in the role of American Alexander. His Australian accent in the film is undetectable and his “everyman” acting style immediately gains the audience’s sympathies.
Carell and Garner explained that they drew on their own parenting experience to get into character, making it one of the easiest films for the two parents to prepare for. Carell explained how he helps his kids on bad days by letting them know that this is normal and life isn’t always perfect.
“You don’t always want your parents to deal with everything for you because ultimately they won’t be there,” he said.
It’s understandable that this movie won’t be at the top of many college students’ must-see lists, but it should not be entirely overlooked. As Arteta so accurately points out about bad days, “Every kid feels this way, and every adult feels this way too. It’s one of the most universal concepts there is, and there’s never been a movie about it.” For a day spent with the family — or even if you feel like forgetting the strains of college life and reliving the family comedies you watched growing up — Alexander’s very bad day will undoubtedly be a very good one for you.

Since Sept. 19, students and teachers have been staging protests throughout Jefferson County in Colorado to decry the school board’s proposed changes to U.S. curriculum. The new curriculum aims to omit certain historical events or ideas that portray a negative image of the United States, and it was motivated by changes to the Advanced Placement U.S. History curriculum made by College Board.
Julie Williams, one of three newly elected members of the Jefferson County School Board who have created a conservative majority, wrote in the proposal for the new curriculum that “Materials should promote citizenship, patriotism, essentials and benefits of the free enterprise system, respect for authority, and respect for individual rights. Materials should not encourage or condone civil disorder, social strife or disregard of the law.”
Though it is, of course, true that the goal of education should not be to tear down the United States, it is also wrong to cover up certain aspects of history simply because they are unpleasant or create less-than-positive images of the United States in students’ minds.
Gabriella Visani, a freshman majoring in occupational therapy at USC, graduated from Lakewood High School last year, one of the schools involved in the protest. Many of her former classmates have participated in the walkouts. Visani called the censorship “dystopian” and “reminiscent of 1984 and Big Brother.”
According to Visani, the censorship of history curriculum is only one of many issues plaguing the school district, but it is the one that has garnered the most attention. She said that the controversy over history textbooks is “representative of what the Board of Education represents, which is kind of this machine-like education system.” Among the other issues facing the district are pay cuts and disagreements between the district and teacher unions.
The most ironic part of this situation is that by proposing the curriculum change, the Jefferson County School Board is teaching high school students a real-life history lesson: to use democratic power to stand up for what they believe. In fact, the students are actually channeling tactics that historical figures used throughout American history in the very events that school board members hope to remove from textbooks, namely those that do not demonstrate a “respect for authority” and instead “encourage or condone civil disorder.”
These Colorado students are promoting the most fundamental ideals of the United States through activities that the school board says do not “present positive aspects of the United States and its heritage.” The board’s attempt to censor rebellious aspects of American history is actually fueling that same desire for disobedience among the current generation of students. What the board fails to realize is that disobedience to authority is one of the key tenets of a democratic-republican government. In fact, without it, there wouldn’t even be a republican government here in the United States. Through free speech and peaceful assembly, Colorado residents are not only taking advantage of their rights, but they are also fulfilling their duties as citizens of the United States to actively participate in government. The board members, who hope to uphold a mythical image of the United States, are not the patriotic citizens in this instance; instead, the patriots are the students, as well as teachers, who are willing to face the consequences of their actions in order to stand up for justice.
If the Board of Education hopes to make changes to the curriculum, they must go about it in a more democratic way or all attempts will fail. Students must continue to demand that their voices be heard, but more importantly, the school board must actually start listening to its constituents. For now, the future of American education — and perhaps other academic subjects — in Jefferson County looks bleak. If the leaders cannot put aside their own personal interests in order to best serve the students, they no longer are fit for office.
As Visani put it, “I love what made [Jefferson County] great, which is passion for education, and I’m really worried that the new board is going to ruin that.” The students of Jefferson County shouldn’t have to worry about ensuring that their school district provides the best and most inclusive education possible. But if necessary, they must continue exemplifying the tenets of freedom of speech and citizen involvement in government that have been exemplified in the historical examples that the Jefferson County School Board is attempting to hide from them.
I am a Colorado resident and this issue is all over our local news. 
The kids in Jefferson County are caught in the middle of a battle between a teachers union fighting to maintain relevance (in the midst of many more school districts locally) and a Board that has parent representatives (elected a year ago despite superior funding of campaign by union). 
The Board after reviewing the AP curriculum decided to focus on educating based in history and not activism as focused by the AP testing company. It is not censorship, it is just a matter of balancing the lessons. 
The kids are pawns (involving initially 3 of the counties 90 or so schools…)

In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays a weatherman who finds himself living the same day over and over again. In the wake of another Supreme Court decision that opened the door for gay marriage in more states, listening to critics of the decision is a bit like being stuck on Groundhog Day; the arguments are still as illogical, intolerant and inconsistent as ever.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
When courts in several circuits overturned five states’ constitutional bans on gay marriage, those states appealed the cases to the U.S. Supreme Court. On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear any of the cases, effectively upholding the decision of the lower courts and de facto allowing same-sex marriage in those states. The decision set off a widespread ripple effect: it cleared the way for gay marriage in states that have struggled with bans against it for years, sending a significant hint that the Court would rule in favor of striking down a ban if an appeals court were to uphold one, which has yet to happen.
Yet, irrationality still reins supreme (no pun intended) in conservative land. Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, labeled the decision a “violation of states’ rights,” stating, “the will of the people has now been overridden by unelected federal justices, accountable to no one.”
Ted Cruz, a Texan senator and two-time winner of the Values Voter Summit straw poll, which made him a favorite for a presidential candidate in 2016, vowed to take constitutional action. “[Marriage] is a question for the states,” Cruz said. “I will be introducing a constitutional amendment to prevent the federal government or the courts from attacking or striking down state marriage laws.”
To be fair, Cruz and Fallin might not represent the mainstream Republican Party, but that could change if Cruz is as successful at motivating the religious right in 2016 as he was at the straw poll. Yet, what is more troubling is the conservative willingness to argue for states’ rights when it’s convenient, and to willfully ignore states’ rights when it’s not.
This willful ignorance usually happens when those evil unelected federal justices on the Supreme Court (who happen to occupy a 5-4 majority in favor of the conservatives on many issues, to be clear) make plenty of rulings that are both incredibly activist and conservative-friendly. Take, for example, McDonald v. Chicago, a five conservative to four liberal justice decision that struck down a gun ban and applied the second amendment’s protection of the right to bear arms to the states. Did anyone hear the conservative party complain that the Supreme Court had taken away the states’ rights to set their own gun laws?
You might be thinking, “The second amendment protects the right to bear arms, so that should apply to the states too” — and you would be right: the Supreme Court, in many decisions, has applied select amendments in the bill of rights as binding to the states. In Windsor v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal definition of marriage as between one man and one women deprived homosexual couples of their fifth amendment right to equal protection and due process. Though the Windsor decision also recognized the right of states to set their own definition, it (and subsequent actions) strongly suggested any state definition that excluded homosexual marriage would be found discriminatory and overturned. The point is, conservatives will always complain about that — but never complain when the Supreme Court intervenes in state affairs in other instances, and that’s hypocrisy.
Neither states nor the federal government should be able to discriminate against people based on sexual orientation. Conservatives would do well to recognize that if anything, this is a matter the government is best left out of. To further demonstrate the purely ancient nature of some of these Republicans’ arguments, let’s take one of the best soundbites against gay marriage of all:
“Gay marriage is a matter to be decided by each state. The states must determine if they feel it is of benefit to society.”
Oops, I mistyped that. That wasn’t a Republican opposing gay marriage — that was George Wallace, one of the most outwardly racist politicians in history, opposing civil rights for blacks in 1964. Here’s what he actually said:
“Integration is a matter to be decided by each state. The states must determine if they feel it is of benefit to both races.”
The similarity is too strong to be ignored, and the bigotry is too sharp to be silent about. So listen up, social conservatives — it’s time to stop using “states’ rights” as an excuse to discriminate. Do you hear the telephone? It’s the 1960s calling, and they want their bigotry back.

Do we need the state to manage marriage? At the time of the founding, marriage was only by churches. Why did the state get involved in marriage? Several religions and politicians pushed the state into regulating marriage. Is marriage better now? Will watering down the exclusiveness of marriage make it better? Can you call gay unions “marriage” and have the participants get the same results of the unions between a man and a woman? I.E. married men live longer than single men – will that accrue for two gay men that “marry”? It will take decades before we find out if this experiment will benefit the parties involved and/or society  at large. 
The federal government does not have a stellar record when it comes to intervention in the private affairs of its citizens or in the affairs of other states. I doubt that the latest intervention into marriage will be positive for either the participants or the society as a whole.
Nathaniel needs to study the US Constitution. 1) States have rights to pass laws where those rights are not taken by the Federal Government in the US Constitution; and 2) Where the states pass laws contrary to the US Constitution, US Federal Courts may void them in cases are brought before them; and 3) Laws in violation of the US Constitution are not legitimate in one state or in any states.
Nate,
We have definitely evolved into a secular society though in actuality we are a covenant nation.  If your not sure what that means look it up.  This is not for the betterment of society. I have no doubt the founders are rolling in their graves.  Maybe you need to take some history classes and learn what those guys stood for and the principles that they founded this country on.  Regardless of changing times or the preservation of the equal protection clause, the gay agenda which has become so pronounced in liberal media and Hollywood was not part of that.  The efforts to desensitize folks isn’t going to fool anyone with half a brain.  They couldn’t have foreseen the stamp of approval for such deviant behavior that wants joyful recognition. The gays belong in the closet where they have been. Nobody other than loser liberals, activist federal judges, and the Marxist president desire to see gay recognition in all 50 states.  It is a stark reminder of the twisted agenda the liberals want to pave for this country.  I have nothing against gays but they can do whatever they need to do in society whether is getting their own health care or bequeathing their assets prior to death.  I have heard the cry about federal benefits but that’s hogwash.  They want to viewed as the same as any other couple but that is outright ridiculous. Men poking each other in the butt and women munching on one another is far from what I would call a marriage.  Homosexuals are not a minority, they are an abnormality in society.  Everything about being gay in contrary to nature and if we seek to give that lifestyle a stamp of approval it goes to show how immoral folks have become in this day and age.  But, who cares right?  As long as nobody bothers me.  As for gun rights, we have a specific amendment for that.  There is no amendment for sexual lifestyles and marriage, though recent attempts by a former administration and the states have apparently been dumped due to activist judges.  I am not sure if you have any morals or ethics running in your blood stream, but the core values and beliefs of the liberals contain none.  Sure you found an old quote that is eerily similar, but let’s not use that for trashing conservatives abroad today and giving sanctity to the gay argument when it was regarding a class of people, not a deviant sexual lifestyle.  So yes, let the states handle this issue because we don’t need the federal government forcing stuff down the throats of all states and the country.  Less government is better whether you understand that or not.  If were currently a one-party system you would realize the grim reality of that existence.  But, then the liberals could have everything they want, a free-for-all society where anything goes and lots of government handouts.  
“A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right.” Thomas Paine, Common Sense
George Wallace was a Democrat, liar.
Nate.. I enjoy  your columns which are generally reasoned and articulate.  However, unfortunately on this issue you are repeating the the same tiresome rhetoric.  The largely unspoken reality on this issue is that “gay marriage” and the “rights of gays to marry” is somewhat of a misnomer.  Gays have always had the right to marry, and back in the 40’s, 50’s and 60’s they often did, in an effort to hide their homosexuality.  On the other hand, many gays actively choose to forgo their right to marry BECAUSE they are NOT attracted to the opposite sex.  If you think this is just semantics, you’d be largely correct because “marriage” is a GENDER-SPECIFIC TERM, which is to say that it has always been defined, specifically, as a religious or civil union between one man and one woman.  What we are seeing happening today is simply a redefinition of a gender-specific term, and that should alarm anyone (and certainly alarms conservatives).
I think the gay community will ultimately live to regret the overbearing and inorganic way in which they achieved their goal of redefining marriage.  Very few states have actually voted in favour of it.  The overwhelming majority of states where marriage has been redefined is (as you acknowledge) the result of judges or state legislatures.
Certainly you can point to racists, bigots or homophobes on the right, but I promise you will find them on the left as well.  Plenty of them in fact.  So, once you discount the extremists, you will find fair, intelligent and reasoned people who believe that it is a terrible shame that so many can not distinguish the difference between providing marriage RIGHTS to homosexuals vs. changing the definition of a gender specific term.  Changing the definition makes as much sense as allowing a gay male monarch to call himself a “queen” instead of a “king”, simply because he feels “left out”, or because he “feels” like a female.  (Yes, the pun is amusing, but the point is serious.)
Let’s look at another moment in history:  When women were correctly and finally granted the right to vote, we didn’t suddenly call them “men”… but rather we gave them the same rights as men.  In reality, the courts at each level could easily have recused themselves on this very basis by affirming that the court is not at liberty to change the definition of gender-specific terms – and that the legislatures must be engaged in the granting of rights.
As to the point about states’ rights issues vs. federal issues, anyone studied in the law knows that generally those issues not specifically reserved for the federal government in our constitution are instead left up to the states.  Marriage, therefore, has typically been left up to the states to govern.  In this regard, issues pertaining to marriage licenses, marriage officiating, legal age for marriage, etc, have all been decided by the states individually.  This is far different from RE-DEFINING marriage itself.  
I ask:  Is this the world we want to live in?  Do we really want to melt down and homogenize the beautiful and special things that make the genders unique?  And do we really believe in our minds and souls that these differences don’t exist? and are not special?  I will continue to deliver a simple message I’ve shared a number of times:  Stop chasing equality!!  It’s not the right goal.  Instead, chase FAIRNESS.  That is the correct goal because things in life and nature are rarely equal… but they should be fair.  Sometimes you will find that your pursuit of fairness results in equality.. .but sometimes it won’t.  We are all special and different and unique, and part of that difference is because of gender.  We should embrace that, not destroy it.
Finally… For all the haters and naysayers who would dismiss me because of my opinion, you should know that I am gay, and in a long-time committed relationship.  I am NOT proud of being gay because I had no choice in that.  Instead, I am proud of who I am as a person.. how I treat others and what I’ve accomplished.  I was personally disgusted and offended at the “No H8” campaign which sought to marginalize and dismiss people with my opinion by saying that we were full of “hate”.  As I mentioned previously, there are many good, decent, loving and intelligent people who believe that we should not redefine gender-specific terms simply because certain people or groups feel left out.  
It really is time that people think outside the box on this issue and take this conversation to the next level because repeating the same tiresome themes of  “equal rights” is really a very simple, selfish, and one-dimensional approach.
Equal rights and justice for all.  It really is that simple.

Vice President Joe Biden visited Los Angeles this Tuesday to promote Mayor Eric Garcetti’s proposal to raise the city minimum wage from $9.00 to $13.25 per hour by 2017. As Biden’s support indicates, Los Angeles has become the latest city to take part in this national trend. To understand this sweeping change, citizens need to think past the long-held belief that wage raises will hurt small businesses.
With this movement maturing from coast to coast, it is no surprise to see critics and pundits alike cite conventional arguments about the effects of increasing wages on the economy. This past May, Seattle raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio recently signed an executive order to raise wages to $13.13 in the city. These city movements are no coincidence. The inefficiency of passing federal legislation through Congress has driven many cities to address imminent problems of wealth disparity and increasing poverty.
Those who argue against the raise follow the rationale that any increase to the minimum wage will be harmful to businesses, result in considerable job losses and hurt the economic growth of the country. These perceptions have heavily influenced the minds and politics of America. But in an era of economic woes where increasing poverty, immense wealth disparity and stagnant growth are no strangers to the country, it is time to reexamine these convictions.
The reality of the matter is that since the 1960s, wages have stagnated while cost of living has tremendously soared. According to Bloomberg, the value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968, and was worth $10.70 in today’s dollar. Due to this decrease in purchasing power, the Department of Labor reported that 88 percent of Americans that earn a minimum wage living are working adults, many of who are now living in poverty.
In Los Angeles, 27 percent of residents are estimated to be living in poverty. The mayor’s proposed minimum wage increase would lift around 567,000 of these people out of poverty.
On a larger scale, though, an increase to the minimum wage would bring a multitude of benefits to the country. In addition to lifting millions of Americans out of poverty, the spending power of low-income workers would also increase, leading to a boost in the job industry. According to the National Employment Law Project, 70 percent of the country’s gross domestic product comes from consumer spending in our domestic economy. In 2009, $5.5 billion was generated due to an increase in the federal minimum wage that year; raising 1968 minimum wage levels would bring an estimated additional $60 billion in consumer spending. This boost in spending ability empowers all Americans — especially business owners.
Though the growth in spending power is an evident effect, many are quick to note that these benefits stemming from an increased minimum wage would be balanced by job losses and increased unemployment, and that it would cause overall harm to business owners. This commonly propagated notion, however, has been frequently debunked.
A 1994 Princeton study was the first to demonstrate that increasing the minimum wage did not result in job losses. The study compared fast food restaurant employment rates after a wage raise in New Jersey compared to rates in Pennsylvania, the control, and found a significant increase in New Jersey and no sign that it led to any job losses. This analysis has been altered and replicated, constantly showing the same consistent results.
Increased savings for businesses is the other significant benefit that results form an increase to minimum wages. This is due to the fact that higher wages lead to a reduction in turnover rates, which lead to a reduction in costs from hiring and training new employees. In one University of California study of the San Francisco airport, it was estimated that each new hire cost about $4,275. These high rehiring costs are pervasive in most industries, so increases in minimum wage actually create large savings for businesses.
In a time of stagnant growth and growing poverty, minimum wage increases are imperative. This will help not only employees, but also businesses because of the increased consumer power to buy their goods and services, lower turnover rates, and savings from decreased costs for hiring and training.
These benefits are becoming irrefutable. Recognition of this conclusion led to over 600 economists, seven of whom are Nobel prize winners, to sign a letter in January urging for an increase in minimum wage while asserting that it will not negatively impact the economy.
Americans must not become paralyzed by our old convictions. It’s time to recognize that a change in thought and action is essential.

USC heads into the desert this weekend to take on undefeated Arizona. The 10th-ranked Wildcats, led by redshirt freshman quarterback Anu Solomon, are riding high after toppling Oregon. Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen sat down with Daily Wildcat sports editor Roberto Payne to provide USC fans with an idea of what to expect about the ’Cats on Saturday night.
 
Daily Trojan: Arizona is coming off an impressive upset of then-No. 2 Oregon in Eugene. What did Arizona do well that game that allowed the team to pull off the win?
Daily Wildcat: Arizona’s upset of then-No.2 Oregon in Eugene may have seemed improbable for the majority of the nation, but really it just same old, same old for the Wildcats.
The Wildcats put up 208 rushing yards behind the two-headed monster of Nick Wilson and Terris Jones-Grigsby. Not to mention the 129 receiving yards the duo recorded against the Ducks.
Combine several timely second-half stops from a bend but don’t break defensive unit, and Arizona did to Oregon exactly what its been doing to opponents all season.
 
DT: Arizona opened as a 2.5 point underdog at home against unranked USC. Do you think that’s accurate or is Arizona getting disrespected?
DW: Is it accurate? Probably not. Does Arizona feel disrespected? Probably not.
Arizona football head coach Rich Rodriguez dismissed talk of disrespect on Monday during his weekly press conference by saying he understands why USC is favored.
Players echoed his statements by saying they’re glad that USC is favored. “I’m glad we [are] the underdog, that just keep[s] the guys focused [on] the task at hand,” UA safety Will Parks said.
 
DT: How are the Wildcats compensating for the loss of standout running back Kadeem Carey this year?
DW: Ka’Deem Carey was one of the best players in Arizona history and his departure definitely sent waves around Tucson. However, the team hasn’t missed a beat since he left for the NFL. The Wildcats are 27th in the nation and first in the Pac-12 in rushing offense behind the duo of Wilson and Jones-Grigsby.
I don’t think anyone could’ve predicted the team having such a dominant run game without Carey.
 
DT: Arizona is 5-0 with four one-possession wins. What contributes to that late game success especially considering Solomon’s youth?
DW: Solomon has taken care of the ball especially well down the stretch of games, as all four of his interceptions have come in the first half of games. He has been nearly flawless in the second half of games this year.
Combine that ball security with an Arizona defense that improves significantly in the second half, and it’s not a surprise that Arizona has outscored opponents 125-63 in the second half of games and is 5-0.
 
DT: Prediction?
DW: Arizona usually keeps things interesting so naturally I’m predicting a double-digit win at home for the Wildcats.
Arizona 35, USC 24.
