Aidan Moriarty received her coronavirus booster shot Friday, the Keck School of Medicine doctoral candidate and USC community luminary confirmed in an interview with the Daily Trojan the same day.
Her vaccination comes after contracting coronavirus late December and, upon trying to understand the University’s guidelines in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, becoming confused on how long she should wait to receive the booster. 
Typing in her laptop on Gmail, Moriarty reached out to USC Student Health Jan. 19 to get a definite answer on the vaccine requirement timeline. While Moriarty did not and still has not received a direct response from the University in response to her question, she did gain the entire student body’s attention when her email forwarded to every single student at USC.
The Daily Trojan spoke with Moriarty, who is involved in Keck’s Programs in Biomedical and Biological Sciences and Cancer Biology and Genomics program, about the eventful day and how she has  navigated her fame ever since.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
Daily Trojan: When did you realize you had replied to everyone?
Aidan Moriarty: Actually, it’s really funny because I almost pressed Reply All, but then I was like, “Oh, no,” like, I caught myself. I was like, “That would be horrible,” and then I pressed Reply, but I didn’t check that the Send To line was just sending to Student Health … if I usually have a lot of anxiety over an email — which maybe I will have forevermore have anxiety over all emails — I would usually check the line, but I was in such a rush, I just obviously pressed Reply and then shot off the email. And so that’s why I was like, “No way, like no it didn’t. It could not have possibly gone to everyone because I’m positive I pressed Reply.” And then, very shortly after, the students in my lab were like, “What? What did you do?” So that’s kind of how that happened.DT: When did you start to see that people had taken notice and started making jokes and memes on the internet?
AM: A lot of people responded to the email privately … A lot of people had said they had the same question, so that was funny. A lot of people were not nice too, but that’s fine. My boyfriend actually texted me and said that some of his friends who do not go to USC saw these memes going around because I immediately texted him right after I found out that I sent the email … So he was actually the one who showed the memes to me.
DT: Which meme was your favorite?
AM: I feel like the train one really hit me … I was also so busy that day. I think I was in meetings till like 9 p.m., and so I was just running around. The train one was very relatable because I felt like a fucking train. I also loved the Padmé one, though. Oh, and the Bernie one. I can’t decide. They were all good.
DT: Did anyone reach out to you personally or privately to check in on how you were doing?
AM: The student register office called me to apologize. Because I said I was COVID positive, and because that went through a moderator and that got sent to the entire student population, that’s actually a HIPAA violation on the side of the school, and so that’s why the Registrar’s Office got involved and apologized and also made sure that IT redacted the email from everyone’s inbox, which I didn’t even know you could do.
DT: What coronavirus vaccine did you receive?
AM: Pfizer fam, all the way.
DT: How was your experience with having the coronavirus late December?
AM: Thank you so much for asking. It wasn’t great, but, obviously, it wasn’t that bad. I was very, very grateful to have been vaccinated with at least the first two main doses of Pfizer because I don’t know how it would have been otherwise. I had a fever for several days, and that was pretty bad. I was really delirious. My boyfriend and I got sick over Christmas, so that was a bummer, but it cleared up, and I didn’t really have a cough or anything like that.
DT: Are you planning to make use of the Reply All function in the future to further causes important to you?
AM: I mean, yeah. It seems like it worked, no?
DT: How has it been navigating your newfound fame?
AM: If I were on the [University Park Campus], maybe I would have a totally different experience and a different answer for you. But [at the Health Science Campus], it’s so quiet over here, and half of these people are doctors, like they don’t have time for my internet fame. But it’s been really fun, and I feel like I’m getting to know the SC fam a little better. I don’t know, it’s just a lot of fun.

In a lawsuit filed Sept. 20, former Keck School of Medicine professor Justin Cheongsiatmoy alleged USC’s Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring program was the setting of fraudulent billing and illegal medical practices in a decade-long pattern. According to the suit, which has 21 causes of action, the University knew of these practices but took no action to stop them. Instead, when Cheongsiatmoy filed complaints detailing what was happening, he was fired. 
IONM, a program that operates at the Keck Hospital of USC and the Los Angeles County Medical Center, is meant to monitor a patient’s neurological signals during surgery and identify when permanent damage to the nervous system is likely. A trained doctor usually monitors these signals constantly and provides assistance if complications arise. 
However, Cheongsiatmoy, who was one of three IONM attending physicians, indicates that resident surgeons were left unsupervised, resulting in complications for patients, such as death or irreparable damage. In some cases, this occurred because the teaching surgeon was scheduled for procedures at both Keck Hospital and LAC+USC at the same time. 
By the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education’s standards, a teaching surgeon must always be present during a procedure. Moreover, Medicare requires a teaching physician to be present during high-risk or complex procedures in order to receive a reimbursement. Because of this, Cheongsiatmoy claims that not only were the IONM’s practices dangerous, but it was also illegal to file for reimbursement on procedures that failed to follow the guidelines. Had the protocol been followed, the suit claims, lives could have been saved.
Detailing one of the instances in which this happened, records show that a patient underwent brain surgery at LAC+USC the day before passing away. No teaching surgeon was present during the surgery, which was performed by a resident surgeon. The patient suffered severe bleeding from the brain and changes in IONM signals. However, with no physician present to interpret the data, a technologist had to do it, failing to correctly identify what the data changes meant.
A Voluntary Self Disclosure statement released by the University in March 2020 states Cheongsiatmoy’s allegations about the lack of supervision during procedures were “not substantiated.” 
The lawsuit also claims that both hospitals billed Medicare not only for unsupervised procedures but also for procedures that were never performed and that the University allegedly falsified records to misrepresent patient care. Cheongsiatmoy claims these fraudulent practices have cost taxpayers more than 200 million dollars. 
The suit states that former CEO of Keck Medicine of USC Tom Jackiewicz, former President Wanda Austin, President Carol Folt and members of the Board of Trustees were among a multitude of University officials who had knowledge of the scheme. 
Cheongsiatmoy also seeks reparations for loss of income, employment benefits and legal expenses as a result of being fired. He submitted complaints detailing the unauthorized practices to various senior employees, including Chair of the Department of Neurology Helena Chui, after which he was terminated in retaliation, according to the suit. Additionally, Cheongsiatmoy claims University employees made defamatory statements, telling his potential employers that Cheongsiatmoy assaulted his colleagues, which he claims prevented him from getting a new job. 
In the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement, the University recognized that there were mistakes in billing for procedures that were not properly monitored by teaching physicians. However, the University denied firing Cheongsiatmoy in retaliation. According to the document, Cheongsiatmoy’s contract came to an end and when he requested a pay raise, it was denied.
“Since this matter first came to our attention, we took immediate steps to investigate and address the underlying issues, including by providing reimbursements to the government and others as appropriate,” the University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We are still reviewing the allegations in the amended complaint and will continue to cooperate with the government, which has not joined the lawsuit at this time.”
Cheongsiatmoy’s attorneys declined the Daily Trojan’s request for comment on the case.

Content warning: This article contains references to suicide, self-harm and domestic violence.
On a visit to the San Quentin State Prison, clinical professor emerita Anne Katz met a man she’d never forget. At 17, he committed murder. Now 70 and having spent more than 50 years behind bars, the man saw himself as a “different person.” Katz has devoted a great deal of her academic and professional efforts to helping improve the lives of others, driven by a principle she gleaned from hearing his story: that people can change.
Katz, along with clinical associate professor Jennifer Lewis, are among the latest USC faculty members granted Fulbright Specialist awards for their work at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. 
Katz, who believes incarceration policies should adapt to reflect the growth that many aging prisoners experience, received the award for her work looking into programs that benefit aging women prison inmates and spending time with ex-prisoners. Lewis, who directed her work to suicide prevention after noticing a high prevalence of suicides occurring in her hometown of San Diego, will use the award to continue developing strategies for prevention.
Katz’s Fulbright award will send her to the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing for six weeks where she will continue to explore the relationship between prisons and aging women inmates, which she hopes will raise awareness about the topic. Lewis will attend Queen’s University in Belfast to further her studies in finding community-driven approaches to suicide prevention.
Katz and Lewis were among a select number of USC faculty awarded in the academic year 2020-2021. Their awards were deferred to the academic year 2021-2022 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Inspired by the various problems within the prison system, including an overall neglect to think about inmates’ human needs, Katz said receiving the Fulbright Scholarship has given her hope that she can shine more light on the issues and develop effective programs for the aging women prison population.
Katz, who worked at the Davis School of Gerontology for 24 years before moving to the School of Social Work, began to look deeper into the aging prison population after one of her students, Aileen Hongo, visited a women’s prison in Chino for an assignment to research older adults. Following this, Katz and Hongo continued to engage in various programs geared toward helping incarcerated women and studying the aging population.
“Most of the women I talked to killed their spouse or their partner … Back then, there wasn’t the battered women’s law, and they probably wouldn’t be in prison now,” Katz said. “Many of them were very poor. A lot of them had trauma.”
Since graduating in 2007, Hongo has continued working in prisons, specifically with women inmates. She currently teaches a reentry parenting class to prepare those who have been incarcerated for long periods of time to reunite with their families.
“Dr. Katz has a gift: the gift to see outside the box,” Hongo said. “I’m just so happy for [Katz] because she’ll take [the award] and run with it … She’s not afraid, and she’s so empathetic to a population that really doesn’t have a voice.”
To combat the isolation, lack of identity and various other challenges that women inmates face, Katz said she hopes to expand model programs like the Gold Coats, which works to help sick and aging people who have been incarcerated. Katz’s ultimate goal is to ensure prisoners get the aid they need to live in safer, healthier environments.
In addition to teaching in USC’s social work doctorate program and multiple advanced trauma courses, Lewis primarily focuses on developing suicide prevention methods by restricting access to lethal means. As opposed to suicide prevention research that centers around early detection signs of self-harm or early behavioral interventions, Lewis’ work aims to discover ways to implement obstacles into spaces prone to suicide attempts. 
Through her research process, Lewis delved into suicidal ideation and learned that constructing barriers is rather effective at deterring the execution of thought-out, specific plans. 
“When we reduce access to lethal means, when we reduce access to those plans … it gives [individuals] time to get help in that immediate crisis and, oftentimes, leads to a reduction in suicide,” Lewis said.
Lewis co-authored “Organizing for Suicide Prevention: A Case Study at the Golden Gate Bridge” alongside Paul Muller, the executive director of the Bridge Rail Foundation of the Golden Gate Bridge. The book manualizes the steps readers can take to install physical barriers and engage the community as mental health advocates. 
“We need to work on multiple fronts in terms of clinically teaching people the skills to, what we call, emotionally self-regulate, to self-soothe in the face of a bump in the road,” Lewis said. “The more we teach early these self-regulation skills to kiddos, to adolescents at schools … the better off we’ll be as adults.”Lewis said the scholarship will allow her to engage in solutions in a broader landscape by working with stakeholders in Belfast, Ireland. There, she will continue to advocate for human-centered design processes for bridges similar to San Francisco’s Golden Gate to produce an “international guide.”
Lewis views the opportunity as a means to engage in practical solutions on a broader landscape while representing USC.
“It’s a great honor because I think the Fulbright Program is highly esteemed, but more so because it enables me to have conversations with communities that would have never occurred prior,” Lewis said.
Help is available for anyone who needs it. Students dealing with mental health concerns can contact the 24/7 phone line (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance from USC Mental Health Services. If you are concerned about a fellow Trojan, you can notify Trojans Care 4 Trojans by calling (213) 821-4710. If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide, you can reach The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

For Dan Lee, a freshman majoring in real estate development, the extension of online instruction came with an unexpected perk: the opportunity to extend his travel plans beyond winter break, allowing him to travel to about 15 countries, all while simultaneously taking his classes. 
Following over a year of virtual classes starting March 2020, an in-person start in the fall inspired hope that remote instruction had become a thing of the past. After delaying the in-person start to the spring semester amid surging coronavirus cases, the University plans to resume in-person instruction next Monday, Jan. 24. 
Some students, such as Lee, were given the chance to make the most of the delayed return and online classes’ “flexibility.” Lee, although glad to have benefited from online instruction’s allowance for travel, said he has also felt the disadvantages that come with remote learning, such as a lack of “self-discipline” to attend class synchronously. 
“Berlin is nine hours ahead. So, if you have afternoon class for example … it’ll be 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. in Europe, so that’s very challenging,” Lee said. “I felt I was being limited and being held back because I don’t really get to participate in the discussions.”
Luana Baseio Ghandour, a freshman majoring in business administration, returned to campus on Saturday, Jan. 8 and found the extended remote learning environment advantageous, as she was able to put a face to everyone she saw in class, allowing her to become more acquainted with her peers and professors without masks. 
“I am excited [about returning],” Baseio Ghandour said. “I want to have more human interactions and I like being face to face with the professor which makes me focus more, makes me more comfortable to ask questions and talk to my friends around me. So I think it’ll be a better learning environment.” 
Although the remote start gave students such as Lee and Baseio Ghandour flexibility in their classes, Jake Hosking, a freshman majoring in computer engineering and computer science, showed concern that certain lab classes lack the hands-on experience that can’t be replicated in a virtual setting. 
“I’m taking … an intro to electrical engineering and for our labs, we’re physically wiring stuff together on breadboards, having the Arduinos, different sensors and lights,” Hosking said. “It’s really hard to do that over a computer screen because it’s very finicky in the certain ports that you have to plug into so if that had to suddenly shift to online, it’d be astronomically more difficult.”
In his general education seminar, Hosking said his professor looked to delay instruction until in-person classes resume. 
“[The professor] pretty much self-admittedly said, ‘Yeah, we’re just going to do introductions and some preliminary stuff, and then once we get back to in-person, we’ll actually start the class,’” Hosking said. “I’m getting similar vibes from a lot of my other classes.”
Though she understands the need for online instruction during a time when coronavirus cases are surging, Andrea Valeria Diaz Tolivia said she has struggled with her emotional health since classes started. Diaz Tolivia, a junior majoring in journalism, said she noticed a common sentiment among her friends that “it just feels like a limbo right now.”
“I feel like it’s just been a fever dream … Everybody just feels like it’s not like a real start,” Diaz Tolivia said. “I guess the words I can use [to describe my current state] are discouraged, tired and just not motivated.” 
After over a year of the routine of online classes and long hours at the computer, Diaz Tolivia said it felt “great” to come back to campus in Fall 2021, physically meet her friends and participate in in-person activities. With a virtual start to the spring semester, she said she feels like she has reverted to her remote routine, which has been difficult to accept. 
“We had that semester that served us hope, and now going back to this is just kind of devastating because we were out of it,” Diaz Tolivia said. “[The remote start] is something that is necessary, but, sadly, it just feels like a cage.”
Diaz Tolivia said she is looking forward to the in-person return this Monday, which she hopes will give her a “daily purpose” and “structure” in her life.

During the holidays, my assortment of thoughts included gingerbread, the cuteness of my dogs, TikTok and the debilitating role student loans play in the nonprofit sector. The last one was courtesy of President Joe Biden’s announcement in late December that he would extend the pause on federal student loan repayments to May 2022.
Since taking office, the Biden administration forgave $11.5 billion in student loans; a small dent in the $1.6 trillion still owed. Yet, despite the crisis these numbers illustrate, Biden likely will not implement the large-scale forgiveness of the up to $50,000 advocated for by Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Chuck Schumer. 
To make matters worse, private student loan companies, similar to the government, don’t look out for the best interests of students. 
Last week, Navient, a huge student loan servicing company, reached a $1.85 billion settlement deal with 39 states after claims of predatory loans. Specifically, the company put massive debts on borrowers who were unlikely to repay them. 
My generation’s drive to change the world and replace the failing structures and systems they see inspires me. Students taking on majors and minors about nonprofits and community-based programs at USC reveal the desire to better our society. 
Outside of the classroom, my peers use social media to accelerate global fundraising campaigns and local activism within communities. Yet, despite smaller opportunities to try to enact social change, student debt makes a full-time career dealing with issues that are largely unachievable.
Nearly a third of Americans have college debt, and with the average student loan debt nearing $38,792 in 2020, students often choose between a fulfilled soul versus a full wallet. Recent college graduates default to jobs that can pay off these loans — and news flash, nonprofit jobs aren’t moneymakers. 
As analyzed by Ensemble News, “according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, on average, professional and management-related workers in the nonprofit sector make $3.36 less per hour than peers in for-profit work.” 
Nonprofit salaries inhibit the ability to pay back student loans, buy a house or start a family, driving many people away from that line of work.
In fact, low pay is one of the top reasons people leave or avoid the sector. While the argument that nonprofit workers need higher salaries deserves an entire article within itself, an additional solution to make a nonprofit career more viable is fighting the student debt crisis.
In 2007, in an effort to entice people to work in the sector, the U.S. government passed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, a way for people working for the government or nonprofits to have their student debt forgiven over a 10 year period. In 2018, however, due to the inconsistencies and complexities of the program, the report revealed the government denied loan forgiveness for about 99% of applicants. While this program should have solved part of the issue, it has not made the nonprofit sector more accessible. 
To qualify for the program you must satisfy five requirements: Be employed by a government or nonprofit organization; work full-time; have direct loans; repay loans under an income-driven repayment plan; complete 120 monthly payments on their loans.
This past October, major reforms took place for a clearer path forward. As covered by CNBC, “the Department of Education will offer a limited waiver so that borrowers can have their payments counted ‘regardless of loan type or repayment plan” and “estimates the waiver will bring over 550,000 borrowers an average of 23 payments closer to loan forgiveness and make 22,000 borrowers immediately entitled to the cancellation.” This change makes it easier to qualify for the fourth step listed above and allows students to pursue more work in the nonprofit sector. PSA — this waiver must be completed by Oct. 31, so if this is something that relates to you, look into it! 
For many, an unguaranteed plan that takes 10 years to implement is not a solution. I’d rather pressure politicians to enact broad-sweeping student debt cancellations of student debt than go through the program’s bureaucracy. However, until that happens, it’s helpful to be aware of the current resources at students’ disposal for a career in the nonprofit sector. 
College provides important educational tools to understand key problems in the nonprofit sector. But, if a person cannot afford to work in the sector after graduation, that knowledge does not reach its full potential. Money becomes a consideration in all aspects of life, prohibiting people from exploring passions and enacting social change. As things currently stand, often only those financially well-off and debt-free can afford to put “changing the world” as a full-time career on their resume.

Prior to wild-card weekend, 12 former Trojans contended to wear a Super Bowl ring on their finger. From Tampa Bay to San Francisco, let’s take a look at some of the players who may win a championship for their city, as well as a few former USC players whose below average teams left them on the outside looking in. 
Ronald Jones II
Following an ankle injury, running back Ronald Jones II was sidelined as he watched his Tampa Bay Buccaneers take control of the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card game. Absent from walk through practice Wednesday, Jones’ status in the Divisional Round matchup against the Los Angeles Rams remains in question.
In his fourth NFL season, Jones saw a decline in statistical production next to quarterback Tom Brady. His inability to pick up opposing pass rushers in the backfield forced Head Coach Bruce Arians to use Jones sparingly, leading to a lack of touches. However, the former Trojan’s Super Bowl hopes remain alive, and, with Brady at the helm, you can’t count the Buccaneers out. 
Amon-Ra St. Brown
A fantasy sports crown jewel, Amon-Ra St. Brown was one of the few bright spots for the 3-13 Detroit Lions. Although it took a few weeks to adjust to the pace and style of professional football, fourth round pick St. Brown exploded toward the end of the season, putting up 560 yards and 5 touchdowns over the final six weeks. 
The wide receiver became a central focus in opposing team’s gameplans. From learning to break contain and get around high-level cornerbacks, St. Brown has figured out how to be effective on the gridiron. The next step for the former USC star will be learning how to, consistently produce for the Lions for an entire 17-game slate. 
Michael Pittman Jr. 
Another byproduct of the Clay Helton era, wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. put up his first 1000 receiving yard season in his sophomore year — the first Indianapolis Colt to reach the  mark since 2018. 
The Colts finished with a 9-8 record and showed signs of promise heading into the next season. If the front office can find another weapon to line up opposite Pittman Jr. on the offensive side of the ball, it could unleash the former Trojan and propel him as one of the toughest receivers to guard in the NFL
Pittman Jr. has 128 receptions and just four drops in his career. An efficient, reliable pass-catcher like Pittman Jr. is a quarterback’s best friend. He will look to reach the 1000-yard mark in his third season and launch the Colts into the playoffs.
Talanoa Hufanga
Rookie safety Talanoa Hufanga has played a role in the San Francisco 49ers defense throughout the year. Hufanga saw action in 15 games this season with 32 tackles and two passes defended. 
Defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans’ tutelage can be huge for a young player such as Hufanga as he tries to make his way into the league. 
His strong season was derailed earlier this week, as the safety was limited in practice Tuesday following a knee injury, and his part in Saturday night’s game against the Packers and potential MVP Aaron Rodgers remains questionable.

The pandemic has controlled our lives for nearly two years. After more than 70 million cases and 883,000 deaths — and quickly rising — securing a coronavirus test seems more difficult than purchasing a pair of Adidas Yeezy sneakers for retail. Given how long we have been in this predicament, one would assume the country is well-equipped for another wave of the coronavirus. However, the government is preoccupied at the moment. 
Deliberating on the defense contractors they look to entrust with billions of dollars to develop hypersonic missiles, Pentagon officials are estimating it will cost approximately $28.5 billion to create these weapons that can hypothetically fly at five times more than the speed of sound. This insane weaponry, which will likely never see the light of day, epitomizes the United States government’s obsession with the defense sector.
As a result, other sectors of society are neglected. The United States ranks dead last in healthcare among the 11 highest-income countries. In terms of education, the country ranks ninth in reading and 31st in math among 79 countries. However, “the greatest nation in the world” leads the world in the number of armored vehicles, Navy destroyers, attack helicopters and aircraft carriers. 
For this upcoming year, the U.S. federal budget is approximately $6 trillion. Defense takes up $770 billion — about 13% of the entire budget. To fully comprehend that number, that means the U.S. currently spends more on defense than the next 11 countries combined. 
Even if the U.S. cut its defense spending by $500 billion, it would still spend $61 billion more than China — which has the second-highest military budget. Additionally, the U.S. is the top arms exporter in the world — responsible for 37% of the global market share of weapons. As it dominates the global arms business, the U.S. does not plan to give up its position to anyone else any time soon. 
Unsurprisingly, the U.S. leads in worldwide coronavirus cases and deaths as we lack resources dedicated to healthcare. The U.S. has fewer hospital beds per capita than most developed countries and struggles to increase its testing capacity. As a result, CVS and Walgreens have limited the number of coronavirus test kits available for purchase, and emergency rooms are also overwhelmed, with more than 155,000 hospitalizations. The White House only recently addressed this issue by stating they will provide test kits starting Jan. 19. 
Clearly, the pandemic exposed the U.S.’ broken healthcare system. Yet, the average annual medical cost per individual is $6,000 — $3,500 more than it would cost in the United Kingdom, where they have a higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. 
With those costs, one would hope the government would commit to improve healthcare quality as they improve missiles. Yet, quality is not even the biggest issue — it is accessibility. 
Low-income marginalized groups are impacted the most by this. When comparing coronavirus cases, three times as many cases per capita occur within the Latinx community compared to white Americans. Black Americans have died at 1.4 times the rate of white Americans. 
Marginalized groups are not in a position to afford the ridiculously high healthcare costs with the wealth inequality in this country. The median Latinx and Black household earn 74 cents and 61 cents for every dollar the median white household earns, respectively. As a result, about 23% of Latinx Americans and 11.8% of Black Americans do not have health insurance, compared to only 7.5% of white Americans. The pandemic exposed inequities in healthcare, in part because of the lackluster medical resources and preexisting conceptions of the healthcare system. 
These same inequalities manifest within the education system. The number one example of this is redlining — the systematic denial of programs such as education for marginalized groups because of race. These groups often have no choice but to enroll in lower quality education than white individuals due to the lack of financial bandwidth to enroll in private education or to possibly drive an extended distance to a better school.
With less than 3% of the federal budget dedicated to primary and secondary education, it is clear why our education system remains broken. Maybe if the U.S. decreases its funding for the defense sector, we can divert some of that toward education. 
Healthcare and education, two of the most fundamental sectors of society, have fallen apart because the government is more interested in developing weapons of mass destruction and being the world’s number one arms dealer. If the U.S. truly wants to live up to the moniker “the greatest nation in the world,” it must shift its focus to protect the health of its citizens and create a better and more accessible education system.

As Trojans, we enjoy a wealth of artistic excellence around us every day. With incredible programs and professors, access to top-tier resources and a long list of spectacular alumni, it’s no wonder that USC cultivates a rich landscape of artists year after year.
But inside that sprawling scene and set against the massive art world of Los Angeles, it’s remarkably difficult for an artist to stand out.
That’s not a problem in USC’s Songwriters’ Forum, a student organization that pulls together members to meet other artists, craft songs and share ideas to ultimately produce an album each semester. When working with the Forum, every artist helps another shine.
Nowhere is that shine better heard than on its fourth album, released this December. The outcome of at least 23 student artists, “Volume IV” is a testament to the beauty of collaboration.
Over the course of the semester, members were invited to workshops, crash courses, recording sessions and panels with industry professionals, as well as general meetings where they could meet other collaborators. That sort of hands-on production is what Forum president Jaja Tong envisioned when she founded the club in 2020.
“When I arrived at USC, I noticed that there wasn’t really an organization for music creators,” she said in an interview on the Forum’s Instagram page. “There were acapella groups and other performance groups, but no [group] was really dedicated to writing and producing music.”
On “Volume IV,” the group delivers on that intention with a fantastic record. The tracks vary in style and tone, but a common thread of invention runs throughout. Of the 11 songs, 10 have at least two credited artists.
The tracklist kicks off strong with “Hand Me Downs,” by Via McBride and Roy Gantz. Its driving grand piano melody underscores the song’s instrumental exploration through gentle choral passages and the powerful guitars and synths riffing over the chorus. Via’s singing remains stoic and refined for the song’s duration, highlighting the emotional journey the music takes.
Other songs take on a completely different sound, revealing the disparate influences and voices among the Forum’s members. For example, “LAX to JFK” by J. Morales and JC features relaxed singing and rapping over a low-key trap beat, a stark contrast from the drama of “Hand Me Downs.”
While more energetic than “LAX to JFK,” “Good Without You” by Chandra, Ethos and Mackenzie Jaimes influenced by trap production elements. The stuttering hi-hats and 808 kicks provide a great base for the earworm hook, singing “I know you don’t believe me / but I’m good without you” — the track is a radio-ready breakup anthem.
As an album by a songwriting club, it’s no surprise that a number of other songs in the tracklist can be classified under the ‘singer-songwriter’ tradition. Over lovely acoustic guitar and string tracks, songs like “First Time” by Hayley Brooke and Paul Khairallah or “Night Unknown” by Lyra Steiner and Jazmin Polido deliver intimate performances throughout the tracklist. Joni Mitchell fans, tune in.
Equally lovely are the album’s lyrics. Lines like “Somehow / I found myself / But have I lost more than I found” (“Take a Look At Me Now” by Ingrid Griffin, Alejandra, JCR and Isaac Griffiths); “If you wanna run away / I’ll be ready any day / Sweep me off my feet, show me how to fly” (“Hypnotize Me” by Annie Wiener and Goldlove) and “These timezones / They get in the way / Of us talking all night / Or waking up to the same day” (“Timezones” by Jenna Chung and Jazmin Polido) communicate the heartfelt truths of college life and relationships with maturity far beyond the artists’ age.
“Full Moon” by Karly Ramnani and Goldlove doesn’t just have a few memorable lines but dedicates its length to conveying the narrative of the singer on a drive, complete with a sudden implied ending. It sounds like the hit ballad from a musical cast recording — one which I hope the artists continue to write.
For me, the buried diamond in the tracklist is “the butterfly effect” by Morgan Stewart, Addie Lillard and Natasha Singh. The gorgeous singing is laid tender and smooth over a slowly evolving bed of ukulele, keys and vibraphone. The song is a group hug for the ears and truly epitomizes the artists’ ability to compliment each other.
The track ends on a playful note, with the absolute jam “Turn a Whole New Page” by Cameron Davidson. There’s only one featured artist here, but the instrumental is so colorful and eclectic it’s as if he collected together dozens of elements and inspirations from the other Forum tracks. It’s a song to smile at, pure and simple.
The dense, 38-minute album is packed with dozens of voices, ideas and lifetimes of influences. The result is a wonderful listening experience and a masterclass in the value and execution of teamwork in art. I look forward to “Volume V”!

Looking to see more of Los Angeles but unsure of where to start? Well, first off, that is very valid. L.A. is huge, confusing and not at all walkable.  
There are so many great parts of the city, from the incredible food to the warm beaches and excellent sports, but sadly, L.A.’s art, more specifically its street art, is often overlooked. On nearly every city corner, artists have let their creativity take over to create something incredible. Street art is a great way to learn about the city and its different communities. And all you need to do to start exploring it, is to clear your schedule and then head to the Metro Exposition line by USC.  
Kobe Bryant Mural by JONAS NEVER, 1336 Lebanon St  
Start your morning with a delicious Dulce breakfast burrito ($8.75), and then stroll over to the Jefferson / USC E line metro stop heading towards downtown Los Angeles. Get off two stops later at the Pico Station Metro stop, right around Crypto.com Arena and walk to the Kobe Bryant Mural created by JONAS NEVER.
JONAS NEVER is an L.A.-based muralist identifiable by their imaginative yet realistic pieces and shockingly quick turnaround times. JONAS NEVER painted this piece in 2015, before Bryant’s tragic passing. It then became an incredibly meaningful memorial for an icon after his death, due to the high quality of the piece and its location near where Bryant played. While there, you are bound to be swarmed by legions of fans, making it into a transformative experience, and allowing you to understand the enormous impact Bryant had on L.A. 
Defend Dignity by Shepard Fairey, 1031 S Grand Ave
After you pay your respects, take a short, 10-minute walk to Grand Ave, where you will find one of Shepard Fairey’s masterpieces, “Defend Dignity.” Fairey is a prolific Los Angeles artist, well known for his politically motivated works. As well as having countless murals located throughout the city, Fairey is perhaps best known for his “Hope” poster, designed for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 Presidential campaign. 
Defend Dignity wants to “inspire sensitivity toward our fellow human beings and the planet itself.” It is a genuinely magnificent and impactful piece of art that inspires us to enact change. It only uses red, white and blue and depicts an idyllic America where there is equality and the country welcomes immigrants. It is a vivid reminder of our country’s flaws and a call to be better.
Fairey has similar pieces throughout Los Angeles, and one could spend a whole day exploring the city through his art alone. But that would be a different article. 
Street Art Street, 4th and Alameda  
Hop back on the Metro to the 7th Street / Metro Center and find the 40 Beverly Blvd. bus line on 6th and Flower. Then, take the bus into Little Tokyo, getting off at 4th and Alameda, or Street Art Street. 
There are many breathtaking murals in this area, but one artist whose work continuously stands out is Royyal Dog. Best known for his photorealistic murals depicting Black women wearing traditional Korean hanbok dresses, Royyal Dog’s work is mesmerizing. His portraits convey various emotions, and luckily for the viewer, they are blown up onto the sides of buildings making you stop where you are and look at it. Along Street Art Street is a plethora of murals to stop, ponder over, and take pictures in front. 
Because there is so much to see in this area, consider picking up some food first. Hama Sushi is a must-try for weekday lunch. And if you aren’t in the mood for a sit-down meal, head to Somi Somi for its mouthwatering Ah-Boong ($6) or to Mitsuru Cafe for a life-changing Imagawayaki to eat on the go ($2). 
The Container Yard, 800 E 4th St  
The last stop on the street art tour is a block away from Street Art Street on 4th Street. Although the inside exhibits are closed, the outside murals of the Container Yard are visible from the road and worth stopping to see. Intricate murals take up every available inch of space on the sides of buildings in this warehouse complex. 
Located at a former mochi factory, the Container Yard allows artists’ imaginations to run wild and provides them with a giant canvas to paint whatever they can imagine. Murals here have depicted everything from random vibrant splashes of color to moving Bryant tributes. The Container Yard previously featured artists such as Tristan Eaton, who has been able to make a name for himself with his fascinating and colorful collages.  
While you are here, make sure to check out Art Share L.A. Although not street art, it’s an artist collective located next to the Container Yard featuring up-and-coming L.A.-based creatives. It’s a free experience and well-worth thirty minutes of your time.

I vividly remember the first and only time I watched the Pixar animated short “Burrow” on the big screen. In my heart, the story occupied far more space than it did in that movie theater. 
“Burrow,” directed by Madeline Sharafian, follows a young rabbit who, true to the short’s namesake, wants to dig a burrow. She has plans to create a nice home for herself where she can live in peace. Yet as the rabbit begins digging, it seems like everywhere she goes, there are other animals cohabiting the space with her. These interactions frighten her, so the rabbit keeps digging to find a space where she can be by herself without interruptions.
The rabbit ultimately burrows too deeply, however, and hits a well. All of the burrows will flood unless she acts quickly. The rabbit ends up crying to a badger, desperate for help. With the badger’s assistance, the rabbit warns everyone about the flooding, and the inhabitants collectively redirect the water away and save their homes. 
After the success of this joint endeavor, the rabbit bashfully asks if the others can help her build her dream home. They’re happy to pitch in, and at the end, the rabbit has her fantasy burrow. It has a private space like she wanted but is in a shared home. The rabbit finds that having company isn’t so scary after all.
As an introverted only child, I relate a lot to the rabbit in “Burrow.” Like the rabbit, I came to USC seeking a private room. I had an intense fear of being judged by others for how I lived in my own space. I told my parents that I wanted to live in a studio apartment by myself because I envisioned others not liking me from the get-go. 
Those anxieties shaped my experiences thinking about college life. The moment that made me think differently, though, was when the rabbit tells the badger about her mistake. The rabbit whimpers and covers her eyes with her ears, mostly because I think she’s terrified of being yelled at for not asking for help or being scared of socializing. 
The badger doesn’t do any of that. Instead, the badger boomingly roars and wakes up everyone to help. Of course, the badger holds the rabbit accountable for her actions, but the community works together to solve the problem. It’s a group bonding experience for the animals, and the rabbit finally musters up the courage to make her dream of having her own home into a reality — with the help of all her fellow inhabitants. The rabbit’s actions taught me that you don’t have to alienate yourself just because you’re fearful of how others will react. 
“Burrow,” like so many other animated shorts, debuted before a feature-length film in the movie theater. Yet, I would argue that animated shorts aren’t just “appetizers” to open films. Sure, they’re short, but in their own way, they’re satisfying by themselves. They leave us with an abundance of questions to ponder culturally and socially. You can choose to watch animated shorts by themselves and leave feeling just as fulfilled as you would watching a movie that’s two hours long. 
As I’m writing this, numerous meaningful shorts come to mind. “Far from the Tree,” for example, looks at the generational challenges of a raccoon family. “Purl” examines gender-based workplace discrimination. Animated stories are a product of culture and society, and we see that in the kinds of stories told. They’re stories about conflicts that are part of everyday life. 
Personally, “Burrow” encouraged me to think about the college experience as a communal one. I’m fortunate enough to have a space for myself but in a shared apartment. This means that I’m constantly negotiating with how to communicate my own needs to others and to ask for help. I’m still trying to find out where my “burrow” is, but I know that in the most idealistic sense, I don’t have to figure out everything by myself. 
It also means that, like the rabbit, I’m ready to be that badger as best as I can, just as I hope that others will be that badger for me. I trust in the message of “Burrow:” that home is better when there are others who collaborate on building it with you. 
I wanted to write “Animated” because I think that for many of us, animation transports us back to our childhoods. Still, there’s no denying that animation remains relevant today even as “adulthood” becomes something all the more real and tangible. Merriam-Webster says that the word “animated” means that something is “endowed with life or the qualities of life.” So, I think watching animation means seeing life, or at least a version of it. 
That day in the movie theater, I wasn’t just seeing a story about a young rabbit. I saw a story that was, in many ways, about myself.
