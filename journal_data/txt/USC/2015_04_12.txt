Political experts from both sides of the much-debated Vergara v. California met  on Sunday for “Life After Vergara: The Future of California’s Public Schools” on Sunday, an educational summit focused on the case’s implications and next steps.
The event was co-hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the Rossier School of Education, the Los Angeles Unified School District and KLCS public radio. Panelists focused on the need to improve California’s public education system, although they often disagreed on how this should be achieved.
In Vergara v. California, nine public school children, under the guidance of Students Matter, sued the state of California with the premise that the laws directing hiring and firing practices for public school teachers left some students with an inherent educational disadvantage. The state’s Superior Court struck down several of these laws, including the “Last-In, First-Out” layoff stature, which allows districts to base layoffs on seniority, without considering actual teacher performance, and the Permanent Employment statue under which districts can grant teachers tenure after less than two years.
A new USC Dornsife-Los Angeles Times poll revealed that the majority of California voters reject tenure and seniority based layoffs for public school teachers. Union advocates and others fear that the case will dissuade potential teachers from the field, however. The decision was appealed by attorneys representing the State of California.
Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute, moderated the panels. The event’s first panel specifically focused on the case’s legal implications and next steps. The side of the plaintiffs, or the students, was represented by Hillary Moglen, principal of the issue advocacy firm RALLY and students’ advocate who helped organize the plaintiffs for the case. On the other side of the debate was Glenn Rothner, an attorney who worked closely with the California Teachers Association during the trial. Howard Blume, primary education reporter at the Los Angeles Times, provided additional, unbiased contributions to the discussion.
After a brief overview of the case by Blume, Moglen and Rothner launched into a lively debate. One of Rothner’s main concerns with the results of the case was the fact that it was based on the faults of just a small number of teachers.
“Vergara focuses on a very small subset of teachers, but beats that drum nationwide … it’s warning potential teachers job [that] security isn’t what it used to be; [that] there may no longer be tenure, and seniority … so people are now questioning whether this is a profession for them,” Rothner said.
Moglen responded by arguing that many teachers actually agreed with the elimination of tenure, saying “people want to be rewarded and encouraged for the work that they do everyday, not just for how long they’ve been doing it.”
The second panel focused on the case’s political and legislative implications and next steps. The panel included Ben Austin, the head of policy development and advocacy for Students Matter, the organization which helped represent plaintiffs in the Vergara case. Doug Herman, a political strategist of the Strategy Group, provided additional insight. Drew Lieberman, the vice president of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research and lead pollster for the poll involving the Vergara case, also contributed.
While the first panel included a lively debate, the second panel served to explain the public’s perception of the debate. Lieberman explained the recent poll, while Herman discussed strategy and Austin described the background of Students Matter.
After each panel, the discussion was opened to questions from the audience and community members, including pre-recorded video questions provided by KLCS.
Though educational leaders and policymakers have their work cut out for them following the Vergara case, panelists seemed to agree that improving the quality of public education is a paramount issue.
“We all agree that we ought to do everything we possibly can to support and train the teachers to do the best jobs they possibly can. We all want the same things, for public schools and the children who attend these schools, so we’re all ultimately on the same side,” Schnur said.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Hillary Moglen is is the president of RALLY public affairs. She is actually the principal of the issue advocacy firm RALLY. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

No. 3 USC (21-2, 4-1) played a fantastic game on Senior Day Saturday against No. 8 San Jose State (19-8, 0-5) resulting in a 21-6 win. Saturday was the last home game for seniors Eike Daube, Monica Vavic, Sara Salamon and Jennifer Stiefel, who collectively scored seven of the 21 goals on the day. But for Daube, she wouldn’t want to go out another way.
“It’s pretty surreal realizing that it’s been four years, and I’m gonna miss it,” Daube said. “It’s been a great four years and I wouldn’t want to finish it off with any other group of girls.”
Emotions ran high on Senior Day, but during the game, the Women of Troy were focused on the task at hand. San Jose State jumped out with the first goal before USC answered with three straight goals. SJSU kept the game close, however, and early in the second quarter scored to make it 4-3. As Vavic said, the Women of Troy began to make changes around this point.
“We changed our offensive game,” Vavic said. “In the very beginning of the game we were getting [some calls against us which led to] automatic turnovers, so that was taking out of our halfcourt offense, but we started making some adjustments, making better releases and changing that aspect of the game so we could continue to attack on offense and then we also started pushing our fastbreak more at the beginning of the game. San Jose was creating a lot of fastbreak opportunities against us and that switched and that also helped change the momentum of the game.”
Then USC broke the game open with 12 unanswered scores with goals for several Trojans, including two goals for Avery Peterson, Brianna Daboub and Eike Daube. The score was 16-4 as the fourth quarter began. But the Women of Troy weren’t finished. Vavic would earn her second and third goals, Ioanna Haralabidis with her second goal, Daube with her third goal and senior Sara Salamon with her seventh career goal added to the beatdown, with the score at 21-6 when the final buzzer sounded. It was a team effort for the Women of Troy as 11 players would score for USC before the day’s end.
Next up for the Women of Troy is UCLA. The last time these two teams met, UCLA came out with a 5-3 victory. USC will be carrying a lot of momentum and confidence into this next matchup though with six straight wins and this great showing on senior day. Daube said USC’s senior day performance definitely helps boost team confidence for this UCLA showdown.
“I think any good offensive game is definitely something that makes you feel good about your shooting,” Daube said. “I think that’s what these games are meant to segway us into. It’s really good to see some of our freshmen pick it up and score when it needs to happen and get rebounds.”
The last matchup of the regular season will take place at UCLA at 1:00 p.m. on April 18.

Distinguished alumni were honored at this year’s USC Asian Pacific Alumni Association Gala.
On April 10, the USC APAA gave various awards to Trojan alumni of Asian Pacific descent such as USC Parents Association co-presidents Debbie and Ben Wong; the CEO of Ito En, Yosuke Honjo; Olympic gold medalist Sammy Lee; and the assistant head coach of the Seattle Seahawks Haruki Rocky Seto.
David Ono, co-anchor of ABC 7 Eyewitness News, served as the master of ceremonies.
This year’s gala marks the most recent effort by APAA to raise money to support future generations of Trojans. Since 1984, APAA has distributed over $1 million in scholarships to more than 450 students. Last year, the organization awarded numerous scholarships to 61 students. In a promotional video for the gala, current APAA President Karen Wong reminded alumni “return, reunite, and reengage” and to reach deeper to assist the next generation of leaders.
Several hundred people came to show their support for the APAA. APAA Executive Director Grace Shiba opened the yearly Scholarship and Awards Gala with welcoming remarks followed by a performance by the Trojan Marching Band and the USC Song Girls. APAA Associate Director Alex Chang and Manager Angela Teng were among those who ran the event event to ensure smooth facilitation.
Lee received the APAA 2015 Legacy Award for his previous involvement in the community. As the first Asian American gold medalist, Lee shared the hardships he experienced at a time where he faced racial discrimination and could not access “white-only” public pools.  To combat this, he would jump into piles of sand to train for spring board diving. The 94-year-old gave an energetic “fight on” before leaving the stage.
James G. Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business, was in attendance to present the Leadership Award to Yosuke Honjo. Honjo is an advisor to the Honjo International Scholarship Foundation, a member of several organizations such as the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and an active member of the U.S.-Japan Council.
Seto received the Leadership Award for not only demonstrating his strengths by leading the Seahawks to their 2014 NFC championship, but also for his various contributions to the APAA and the Trojan family.
Lastly, Ben and Debbie Wong were bestowed with the APAA 2015 Service Award for their involvement in the Trojan community. Both are heavily engaged in USC affairs. Currently Ben Wong serves on the board of the Center for Asian Americans United for Self-Empowerment while Debbie is on the Kappa Alpha Theta advisory board.
Every year, APAA applauds the efforts of outstanding members of the Asian Pacific Islander Trojan Family while recognizing current USC APAA scholars for their endeavors. An information booklet handed out at the gala explained that the goal of the event is not only to highlight the accomplishments of past and present Trojans but also to help future generations which demonstrated the need for great financial assistant.
“We are not only recognizing students because of their [financial] need. We also want to recognize high levels of achievement within API students,” APAA President-Elect Jaime Lee said.
The USC APAA supports the advancement of Trojans by building relationships between alumni and students by providing a voice for the Asian Pacific Trojans. A video highlighting some of the current and previous APAA scholars was presented during the ceremony. The purpose of the video was to demonstrate the impact of the scholarships on students and how APAA’s continual endeavor to provide them translates into success for all of USC.
“I was able to get involved with a lot of Asian American communities outside of USC. That’s really enabled me to seek out other stories and other histories,” current APAA scholar Andy Su said.
Patrick E. Auerbach, associate senior vice president for alumni relations, explained that the mission for the APAA and the importance of garnering more support from the community.
“The APAA is very specific to the community, but part of the mission of the APAA is to grow great support for the university on a greater scale, and to be that entry point for some alumni,” he said.
Guests provided support for the APAA’s future endeavors with bids on both live and silent auction items, which were donated by more than 100 contributors. Among the items was a customized, one-of-a-kind USC Darth Vader mask. Others gave direct donations during and after the gala.
The USC East Asian a capella group, Trogons, provided live entertainment during the event’s dinner by singing their rendition of Disney’s “Make a Man Out of You.” Cinematic Arts alumni Jon Paul Puno, accompanied by Ashley Hoe, closed the evening with a special performance of Andrea Bocelli’s “Because We Believe.”

In 1968, Paul Ehrlich published his bestseller The Population Bomb, which warned that worldwide overpopulation would cause mass starvation and societal upheavals in the future. This book was indicative of the widespread fear of a “population explosion” in the 1950s and 1960s, which was predicted to strain the planet’s resources and cause global food shortages, among other catastrophic events. Since then, however, some parts of the world have been debating about not overpopulation, but underpopulation.
On April 8, The New York Times reported that Denmark was undertaking several initiatives to solve its underpopulation crisis and the issue of its low birth rate. One such initiative entails adjusting its sex education program to talk to teenagers about pregnancy in a more positive light, while still educating them on how to avoid getting pregnant. Marianne Lomholt, the director of Sex and Society, said, “For many, many years, we only talked about safe sex, how to prevent getting pregnant … Suddenly we just thought, maybe we should actually also tell them about how to get pregnant.”
Denmark and other European countries have long suffered from a low birth rate that is below the widely accepted 2.1 children per woman necessary to maintain a population at its current size. In other words, unless these countries can reverse the decline of their birth rates, their native populations will continue to shrink in size. Furthermore, as each generation is filled with fewer people, the number of elderly people for every one young person will continue to increase, putting a burden on social pension systems and requiring heightened elderly care.
As a result, the governments of these countries have become increasingly anxious about underpopulation. Germany’s former Minister of Defense, Ursula von der Leyen, declared that if Germany didn’t turn its declining birth rate around, it would have to soon “turn out the light.” Meanwhile, André Rouvoet, leader of the Christian Union Party in the Netherlands, has strongly urged the government to encourage people to have more children.
To combat the threat of underpopulation, these countries have made a variety of plans and attempts to encourage people to have more children. These plans range from making child rearing easier for families through measures such as family subsidies, to encouraging people to have children by offering financial incentives, to promoting childbirth with ideas linking child birth to patriotic duty.
Spies, another Denmark-based organization in the travel industry, launched an initiative last year that aired several commercials showing a young Danish couple booking a hotel in Paris to do their duty of raising their nation’s birth rate.
Given historical attempts to raise national birth rates in the past, these measures should be met with skepticism. In 1944, the Soviet Union began bestowing the honorary title of “Mother Heroine” upon women who were raising 10 or more children. Over the next few decades, more birth rate-centered policies were passed, such as increased benefits for families with children and lump-sum payments for giving birth to a child. By 1981, the Politburo offered a year of partially paid leave for women who had a baby. Then, in 1986, it increased this to a year and a half.
But despite these attempts to resolve underpopulation in the late 20th century, the Soviet Union’s fertility rate declined in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, with the exception of a short increase in the late 1980s, after which it declined again. Measures taken by other countries in the past have been met with equal numbers of success and failure, which suggests that the birth rate might be somewhat out of a government’s control. Population studies scientist Jan Hoem supports this, saying that fertility is “best seen as a systemic outcome that depends more on broader attributes, such as the degree of family-friendliness of a society, and less on the presence and detailed construction of monetary benefits.”
Perhaps European countries with low birth rates should see if they can find a way to more effectively control the social norms on having children, before they start handing out cash incentives.
The one other hope we have is that advances in IVF treatments make it possible for infertile women to have babies.That could also be a solution to have elderly mothers be treated to have more babies from donor eggs. Many women want to have babies and we should encourage it financially for them to do so.
IVF fails 75% of the time and is very expensive. I don’t think it is wise to encourage it.
 Investment in children is investing in the future.We need more children being born.So I dont think cost is an issue.The cost of not having children is far greater.
I am for introducing a “national birth service” much like a military draft. Where young women are drafted to have babies from a mixture of donors and she can then choose to keep the children and raise them with state subsidy and aid or give them to the state to be raised in foster homes.The fact the birth rate is at extermination level is a enormous disaster both socially and economically which warrants such a measure.

A road trip to the Bay Area this weekend yielded a win over No. 27 Cal and an upset loss to No. 36 Stanford for the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team.
The Trojans topped the Bears, 4-2, on April 10. The Trojan duo of senior Eric Johnson and sophomore Conner Farren and the pair of junior Max de Vroome and freshman Thibault Forget both fell by scores of 6-3 as the Bears took the doubles point to open the day. In singles, Cal’s Andre Goransson upset senior Yannick Hanfmann 6-4, 6-1 to put the Bears up 2-0.

Another spring game is in the books for the USC football team, and it appears there is much to look forward to when the program returns for the season in the fall. The spring period is always welcome, as it provides a small sampling of next year’s squad while briefly breaking up the very difficult eight-month period without any college football.
This year was no exception, as Trojan fans across the country paid close attention to the development of underclassmen to see who might start next season. Many key players from last year dominated in the spring, demonstrating improved skillsets across the board especially on offense.
Quarterback Cody Kessler, who put up great statistics last season, looks more mobile and fluid in his movements. A former high school basketball star, Kessler came into USC heralded as somewhat of a dual threat. Though no one was confusing him with Braxton Miller when he was recruited, he was evaluated as a new age quarterback and fellow quarterback recruit Max Wittek fit the more traditional drop back role.
In his two seasons at the helm, Kessler hasn’t really displayed much mobility. Occasionally, he has made some big plays with his feet that show his athleticism does actually live up the hype. For the most part, however, it seems as if his bulky knee brace keeps him situated in the pocket. There is no question Kessler can move, and if he is even fleeter footed this year than he was last, it will add an entirely new dimension to the USC offense.
The Trojans don’t need him to be Marcus Mariota back there, but if defenses have to respect his running ability, Steve Sarkisian’s up-tempo downhill running scheme can operate on full cylinders. Keith Price, who was the quarterback under Sarkisian at Washington, wasn’t as good of a running quarterback as his predecessor Jake Locker, but he was still a threat to run. This kept defenses honest and allowed the Huskies skill position players to excel.
If Kessler can occupy the attention of an extra linebacker on every play, it can open up lanes for Justin Davis and Tre Madden, as well as seam routes for whoever ends up playing tight end, much like it did for running back Bishop Sankey and tight end Austin               Sefarian-Jenkins at Washington.
In addition to Kessler, wide receiver JuJu Smith appears to have taken the next step in his development as a wide receiver. Smith, who dominated older cornerbacks as a freshman last season, has sharpened his route running skills and has taken over the role of number one option from departed receiver Nelson Agholor. If Smith continues to demonstrate the manic work ethic he has become known for in the past year, he will go down as one of the greatest wide receivers to play at USC.
He has a rare combination of power and speed that is more impressive at his current stage of development than Robert Woods, Marqise Lee and Agholor had entering their respective sophomore seasons. All three had excellent careers as Trojans and came on strong during their sophomore years. It will be interesting to see if Smith can match or eclipse their sophomore campaigns.
Though Smith will be the primary target, there are a bevy of other options to also throw to. Redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell has been amazing this spring. Mitchell, who dominated the Los Angeles high school circuit at Bishop Alemany in the San Fernando Valley, has finally recovered from the ACL injury that sidelined him for a full season. If he can stay healthy, he will be a presence during the season.
Flanking Mitchell will be sophomore Ajene Harris, who came on strong as a true freshman during the early part of last season. Though injuries and some troubles learning the entire playbook slowed him down, Harris is a dynamic threat who can make plays in space. As showcased in the spring game, Harris also played quarterback in high school at Crenshaw and can be used to carry out a trick play or two during the season.
These are only a couple of the players who impressed during the spring. Though the team is still not at full strength, it was a promising set of practices for the future of Trojan football. One should never set their hopes too high after the spring, but it’s good to remain cautiously optimistic with the team the Trojans look to put out on the field next season.

USC spring football concluded on Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after the annual spring game. With a thin depth chart, head coach Steve Sarkisian opted not to play a full split-squad game, instead running a similar system as last year, with a scoring system in place for both the offense and defense. With USC royalty from Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott to projected top-five pick Leonard Williams in attendance among the reported 22,788 fans, the Trojans took the field and showed off what they had been working on through 14 spring practices.
Despite being in full pads, there wasn’t too much contact throughout the game, which meant that players such as tailback Justin Davis were a bit starved for touches, but this allowed USC’s lethal aerial attack take center stage. The Trojans’ top two signal callers both enjoyed productive days: senior starter Cody Kessler completed eight of 10 passes for 126 yards and a touchdown in his brief stint on the field, including a 60 yard bomb to redshirt sophomore receiver Steven Mitchell, who continued his head-turning spring with seven catches for 90 yards.
Redshirt sophomore signal caller Max Browne has also impressed many this spring, and he didn’t disappoint on Saturday. Sarkisian said that the spring game “was Max Browne’s game,” and the young quarterback put up great numbers in what will likely be his most significant time on the field until Kessler’s departure after next season. Browne completed 24 out of 37 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns with no turnovers, and his remarkable progress, despite a lack of game action, was not lost on his coach.
“His game has drastically improved -— it’s very evident.” Sarkisian said. “As a coaching staff, [it] is very encouraging to us that our practices are that competitive. . . we can create [a competitive atmosphere that] can help a quarterback develop.”
During last year’s spring game, the Trojan offense struggled as it adjusted to coach Sarkisian’s system during his first year in charge. This year, however, USC experienced no such offensive problems, which pleased Sarkisian.
“I think it’s night and day [compared to last year],” Sarkisian said. “The guys are very comfortable in the system, and not just the system but the subtleties and nuances within the system.”
When compared to last spring’s numbers, there is no doubt that this Trojan offense has become much more comfortable in Sarkisian’s system. In 2014, the offense fell to the defense by a score of 15-19, with Kessler completing five of 10 passes for 86 yards (Browne was five for 15, 65 yards). This year’s score was 37-23 in favor of the offense, and the quarterbacks’ stellar stat lines speak for themselves.
It was widely expected that  wideout Nelson Agholor’s departure would leave a gaping hole in the Trojan receiving corps, but if this spring and the spring game are any indication, USC will be just fine. Sophomore JuJu Smith capped off a productive spring with an outstanding line of nine receptions for 152 yards and a touchdown, and junior Darreus Rogers and junior college transfer Isaac Whitney made four and five grabs respectively.
“To me, the receiving corps were a real positive coming out of [spring practice] that I didn’t [anticipate],” Sarkisian said.
The biggest surprise of the day came from walk-on redshirt junior Christian Tober, who nabbed two short touchdown catches: one from Kessler and one from Browne.
The high-octane offense might have stolen the show on Saturday, but the plays made on the other side of the ball also hinted at a bright future. The defense forced three three-and-outs against the offense, redshirt sophomore Joel Foy recovered a fumble and redshirt freshman Jalen Jones picked off a Ricky Town pass. This was all without the wealth of defensive prospects arriving in the fall, including five-star cornerback Iman Marshall.
The defensive line put pressure on the quarterback, though sacks were called very quickly throughout the game in order to minimize contact. Sarkisian was satisfied with what he saw from his front four but also noted it as an area of focus in the fall.
“We need to get [the defensive line] healthy … [and] we need to get the influx of these freshmen that are coming in,” Sarkisian said. “To solidify that is going to be a big point of emphasis of ours when we come back for fall camp.”
Meanwhile, kickers Matt Boermeester and Alex Wood continued their battle to replace the graduated Andre Heidari, and both played perfectly on Saturday. Redshirt sophomore Boermeester opened the scoring with a 52-yard boot before hitting a 39-yarder later on. Redshirt junior Wood turned in almost an identical performance, splitting the uprights on a 51-yard attempt after nailing a 35-yarder shortly following Boermeester’s first score.
USC fans got their first look at four-star recruit Ricky Town on Saturday. Unfortunately, the Ventura native went zero for one, throwing his second pass for an interception. Sarkisian shrugged off Town’s early struggles, saying that it was “part of being a true freshman quarterback.”
Sophomore safety John Plattenburg is still dealing with a sprained ankle and did not participate in the spring game.
Sarkisian praised junior Su’a Cravens, calling the linebacker-safety “ridiculously talented” and saying that “his effort has been contagious.”
USC opens the season on September 5 against Arkansas State.

It is a good time to be associated with Marvel Comics. That statement has been generally true over the last few years with the explosion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but now is one of the high points. Avengers: Age of Ultron is quickly approaching its May 1 release date, and the Hulk-level destruction it is about to unleash upon the worldwide box office. If Furious 7 — which has exceeded all expectations to zoom past the $800 million mark already — doesn’t reach the vaunted billion dollar mark in the next couple weeks, Age of Ultron is essentially guaranteed to become the 20th movie to ever do so.
Amid all the Avenger brouhaha, however, Marvel Television has gifted its fans with quite the aperitif. The Netflix original series Daredevil was released on April 10, exactly three weeks before Ultron. It is a sleek, dark series that works amazingly well in contrast with the tentpole spectacle that Ultron is about to unleash. Daredevil stands both as a testament to the cinematic universe that Marvel has been able to build better than anyone else, and as a reminder that not all superhero properties need $100 million budgets to be interpreted perfectly for the screen.
The Daredevil series is firmly entrenched in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. From the very first episode, the aftermath of the events of the first Avengers movie are not only felt, but intertwined into the story. This model, of course, has been used by Marvel before for its Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Carter series on ABC. Daredevil, however, feels very different from those. Though Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has become a very entertaining TV show, it is very firmly in the old guard in terms of style. S.H.I.E.L.D. has a mostly unknown cast facing mystery-of-the-week one-episode arcs with unspectacular special effects. Though a very fun series, it would be a stretch to declare S.H.I.E.L.D. a series that would be guaranteed to stand by itself without the MCU to lean against.
Again, Daredevil is very different. Here is a series that would undoubtedly stand firmly under its own power. It uses a complex story structure spanning several episodes. Its cast includes established talents like Rosario Dawson, Vincent D’Onofrio and Scott Glenn playing against the relatively unknown but impressive Charlie Cox in the lead role. This show makes the coveted leap that the very best TV (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc.) has aired recently. It is not so much a classic TV, but rather a 13-hour movie released in parts.
All the usual strengths of this type of format are covered here. Thirteen hours with Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock makes for a very familiar and fleshed out character. For comparison’s sake, Robert Downey Jr.’s role as Tony Stark will only be completing its eleventh hour on screen at the completion of Ultron despite being in five films as a central character. Marvel devoted two entire movies, Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3, in trying to show the more human side of Stark. Despite this, In one quick dump of Daredevil episodes, Matt Murdock — Daredevil’s secret identy — has leapt to the top in the Marvel leaderboard for dedicated screen time — only Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has enjoyed more screen time, but individual character development is less of a priority in a show like that.
Daredevil is a great choice as the first character to get this sort of deep dive treatment from Marvel. His storyline since his creation by Stan Lee in the ’60s is one of the most complex in the Marvel Universe. Frank Miller’s legendary run at the helm of the comic book during the early ’80s resulted in one of the better, darker character arcs one can find in a major comic book property. Matt Murdock’s struggles with justice, vigilantism and corruption are ripe with possibilities. Additionally, his very unique power set as an acrobatic blind martial artist have led to very creative depictions in the comics of how Daredevil “sees” the world.
Really, Daredevil is one of the most interesting characters in the entire universe. Likely the only thing that stopped him from being featured in one of the upcoming Phase 3 MCU films with the likes of Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Ant-Man (technically the last film of Phase 2) is the stigma that still lingers from the 2003 feature film starring Ben Affleck. That film is not as bad as its reputation suggests, with Colin Farrell’s maniacal Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan’s mountainous Kingpin playing their parts to perfection. It is, however, an example of a movie getting the tone of its source material very wrong. The film’s reputation is very poor, and it likely played a big part in Marvel’s decision to “relegate” Daredevil to a TV slot as opposed to splashing his name on the El Capitan Theatre big screen back in October’s big Phase 3 announcement.
But, by all appearances, this relegation has been a boon for the character. Affleck’s 2003 debacle has led to 13 high-quality hours with the character instead of two. In addition, four to eight additional episodes are coming in the eventual Defenders miniseries planning to incorporate Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist (if you are not familiar with Iron Fist, you should really familiarize yourself with it). All those characters are eventually getting their own Netflix series, but the crown jewel is Murdock. The character has found new life in what is possibly its optimal on-screen format and no one should be surprised if he makes it into the next tentpole Avengers production Avengers: Infinity War Part 1 in 2018 as MCU boss Kevin Feige has strongly hinted. The Marvel train just keeps on rolling.

It is hard to imagine that behind the adorable accent of Ben Thatcher is a legendary drummer and member of the rock group Royal Blood. From Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl and many others, the band has been praised by the best and most iconic of the genre as the saviors of rock. With a platinum album, Royal Blood, that was released August 2014 and a future tour with Iggy Pop and Foo Fighters, those lucky enough to grab tickets to their gig at the Fonda Theatre on April 13 are sure to get a concert of their life.
Royal Blood is more than just talent and passion, though those in themselves are more than enough to make the music stand out. The uniqueness stems from the band setup. Following in the footsteps of other rock stars like The White Stripes and The Black Keys, Royal Blood is a two-piece band consisting of Mike Kerr on bass guitar and Ben Thatcher on drums. They never had any intention of being a two-piece band, but as Thatcher explains, they never had any intention of being a four-piece band either.
“We didn’t really think at all, we just knew that we wanted to write some music together and have a good time,” Thatcher said. “We just got together and started jamming and kind of started writing some songs and we were pleased with the sound of it so we didn’t add any members.”
This laid-back attitude extends beyond just how the band originated — it is apparent in all of Thatcher’s responses, and it is at the very core of their mentality in handling their success and their career.
“We write music initially because we love it and we love playing. What we think is good is good enough for us and it’s great to kind of share that with other people who think it’s great as well,” Thatcher said. “There’s so much hate for artists. If you don’t like it, it’s totally cool but we write it because we enjoy it and we share it so other people can share it as well.”
And what is good enough for Royal Blood is certainly good enough for the world, or at least that is what their sold out shows, their several festival appearances and the Best British Group award would imply. With just a bass guitar and drums, Kerr and Thatcher create powerful sounds that fill whatever space they are in. Each song is impossible to play on anything less than the maximum volume capacity to allow the intensity of the bass and the technical perfection of the drum to take over the listener’s heartbeat.
It goes beyond their technical skill — Royal Blood has found a way to perfectly combine the classics with the modern. Apart from the quality sound mixing and production, their music could be placed in any time and fit in while still sounding edgy and ahead of its time — whether it’s the 1960s, now, or in 20 years. One can only assume that their eclectic music taste and open-arm view of music helps influence such a revolutionary sound.
“We’re actually into a lot of different things. We don’t care about genre. We care about good songs and good songwriting. If you feel something from a song, an emotion, it’s good. It means something,” Thatcher said. “No matter whose singing it or what they’ve done in their personal life, that doesn’t matter. It’s all about what you feel when you hear that song.”
Though Royal Blood is being heralded as the future of rock, they won’t let that pressure them into defining their music. Thatcher made it clear that despite what people think and where they end up, their music will be what they want to create and what occurs organically between the two passionate musicians.
“I think, as a band, we’re always going to push ourselves and push each other musically to do things we’re not used to,” Thatcher said. “We’re gonna keep on going. We feel like we’ve started to write some good new songs for the record and we’re really excited about putting them into recording and seeing how that all turns out I guess.”
Thatcher said the group has many varied influences for live performances.
“We’re influenced by many different things from the old and new rock bands,” Thatcher said. “But lots of different performances but we kind of go and do our own version of that and basically our show is all about having a good time and giving the audience what they can take away with them and having a lot of fun and loud and good.”
With regard to their upcoming L.A. performance, Thatcher said he fell in love with the venue and had fun during their previous two L.A. performances.
“The L.A. crowd is very exciting and we love playing here,” Thatcher said. “It’s gonna be a good time and we’re absolutely looking forward to it.”
Los Angeles, give a warm welcome back to Royal Blood. The band is not just taking rock by storm, but the whole music industry. Don’t let the joyful demeanor and blush-worthy accent mislead; these two mean business with their music.

After ODESZA’s anticipated sophomore album, In Return, released in late 2014, fans all over the world became captivated with its irresistible hooks and dreamy indie-electronica atmosphere. Now on tour, the Seattle-based duo delivered on keeping the hype from their previous work that first set them apart from other viral EDM hit producers.
ODESZA took the stage at around 11:15 at The Glass House in Pomona on April 9. Its two openers, Lane 8 and Robert Delong, got the crowd excited for the show, but the audience quickly grew impatient wanting the main act to come on. After Delong played his last song, the extra D.J. equipment on the stage was taken off, and only two clear set tables were placed along side each other in front of a projector screen.
Knowing ODESZA’s stunning trademark for beautifully uplifting music and being a greatly designed brand overall, the audience looked forward to a show filled with lasers, great lighting and videos on the screen behind them to do full justice to the music being produced on stage. The entire atmosphere was euphoric and fit well with ODESZA’s sound.
Members Harrison Mills (a.k.a. Catacombkid) and Clayton Knight (a.k.a. Beaches Beaches) took the stage and opened with “IPlayYouListen.” They continued through the beginning of their set with more music from their 2012 album Summer’s Gone, such as the hit, “How Did I Get Here.”
Their entire set wasn’t only performed on a D.J. pad controller as the duo moved around from their set tables and played on small drum sets for “Memories That You Call.” The group finally unveiled a song from their new album with bringing Shy Girls onstage to play “All We Need.” This marked a change in the setlist where from that point forward  they only used songs from their In Return.
“Sun Models” created a potent atmosphere and the crowd enjoyed the pop-infused, electronic feel that filled the theater. Hues of orange and pink lights surrounded the duo with fog all over the stage that set the tone of their trademark style. The lights and pops of eclectic art that projected on the screen behind them resembled their album cover.
Mills and Knight performed and danced to their popular song “Bloom” right before walking off stage as if their performance was over, though there was no fooling the crowd that filled this room. Everyone yelled for an encore and continuously chanted for their hit song “Say My Name.” After the crowd went in a frenzy, the duo ran back onstage and brought Zyra with them immediately, playing her song “It’s Only.” Everyone was glad to have them back on stage, but they weren’t yet fully satisfied. “Say My Name” was chanted all over the floor and balcony of the venue when the duo finally rewarded the audience with a fantastic performance of one its greatest singles.
Finally, after the crowd got their fix and were ready for the duo to announce their finishing thank yous as they turned off all the lights. But before anyone moved, they surprised their fans with their remix of ZHU’s hit “Faded,” left their D.J. tables, clapping with the crowd and dancing on stage.

A 20th-century dictum on aquatic environmental protection proclaimed, “the solution to pollution is dilution.” The world’s oceans are so vast that it was believed that human output would ultimately yield a negligible effect on the global environment. Faced with unprecedented issues of planetary degradation resulting from a saturation of human byproducts, the foolishness of such an adage cannot be understated. Rather, the human impact on the marine ecosystem is such that we’ve actually lowered the pH of the oceans — a process known as ocean acidification — and have endangered organisms of both ecological and economic importance. The process, already well underway, is just another dangerous consequence of unchecked human activity, and serious mitigation efforts are necessary if we are to avert devastation.
Sometimes referred to as the “other carbon problem,” acidification occurs when increased concentrations of carbon dioxide enter the atmosphere and, ultimately, the ocean. Because the ocean acts as a sink for these heat-trapping emissions, increased fossil fuel combustion causes greater quantities of carbon dioxide to permeate the ocean. Once bound by sea, molecular carbon dioxide engages in a series of chemical reactions that ultimately produce a higher concentration of oceanic hydrogen ions. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution some 150 years ago, the repetition of these chemical reactions has driven down the pH of the ocean, a process that in past geological epochs has occurred over many thousands of years. Scientists have measured a decline in pH from about 8.2 to 8.1. While this might seem insubstantial, the pH scale is logarithmic, so such a change actually represents about a 30 percent increase in ocean acidity.
For organisms that form shells or depend on calcifying processes — corals, shellfish, sea urchins, among many others — this is troublesome news. A decrease in ocean pH threatens these vital processes and the existence of these species. The variety, beauty and richness of species and ecosystems that have taken millions of years to evolve are now under assault from a century and a half of profligate human emissions. And the impacts aren’t of solely ecological concern. Shellfish aquaculture is a multibillion dollar global industry, and is at great risk of collapse if the change in ocean chemistry accelerates. Massive oyster deaths in hatcheries off the state of Washington have caused great alarm and have mobilized leaders toward allocating over $3 million in research funding. In Alaska and New England, offshore farms for crabs, clams and scallops face similar concerns.
Eco-tourism related to coral reefs comprises a tremendous sector in the global economy and is especially relevant to developing nations in the Caribbean and South Pacific. The bleaching and disintegration of many reefs is the predicted outcome if acidification follows its current trajectory. Increasingly corrosive waters greatly endanger these ecosystems, which are some of the most productive in the world.
To preserve our financial interests in these marine ecosystems, as well as their biological integrity, immediate action must be taken. Research remains of utmost importance as we continue to understand the process of ocean acidification and project how it will proceed in the coming century. Public funding towards state agencies and universities must forge academic coalitions and develop a network for monitoring vulnerable coastal areas and ecosystem health.  In the same vein, education of the public is a major priority, as many people still do not recognize ocean acidification as an additional consequence of global warming.
Most critically, society must take the necessary and timely steps to substantially cut its carbon dioxide emissions. As the predicted effects of climate change gain greater clarity, it is evident that efforts to subdue the problem will be far more efficient than the steps required to adapt to it. Entire industries and ecosystems depend on our ability to reduce emissions. As is evident with ocean acidification, failure to do so will have dire results.
