A group of USC alumni and team of 31 USC student interns launched Mydas, an app similar to LinkedIn that lets users share all social media accounts, professional background and contact information in one touch, in early January.  The networking app is tailored to the USC community and capitalizes on the University’s Trojan network, according to the app’s founders.
“We’re trying to really just hone in on this market,” Mydas Chief Product Officer Prateek Malani said. “This is our market, our school … If our big goal is to really share that Trojan network, that vision, that exclusivity, that ability, that networking — it is so important to everyone else. It starts with honing in on making that Trojan network digitally stronger first.” 
Through the app, users sign up and connect their social media platforms to their profile and then select which social media platform they would like to share with other Mydas members. Under the network section, users can note any information about their connection with a person or group, such as where or when they met them. 
“What we’re trying to do is kind of become that main app, that main tool you use when you’re at a networking event,” Malani said. “When you’re at a USC social event, whether it’s football or at Greek Row, etc. Whether it’s a classroom that you can go ahead and make as much friends, make as much connections for your future as possible.” 
Diti Shivlani, a freshman majoring in business, first found out about the app from Instagram stories posted by her friends. She said the app makes her feel safer sharing her information, since she can decide after people share their information with her if she would like to share her contact. 
“The app is most convenient for me because I am really trying to make friends as a freshman,” Shivlani said. “So, I try to share most of my information. It’s been really helpful in that sense.” 
Mydas CEO Michael Gurayah, a Marshall School of Business alumnus, developed the idea for the app during the end of his junior year and pitched it in his entrepreneurship class. When he noticed that students were interested in working on it, he decided to pursue it that summer.
“We want to actually make the Trojan network have students,” Gurayah said. “Start with these connections and maintaining it past college, that’s the great part of the Trojan Family: Everyone’s staying connected from social settings and classroom settings and keeping the Trojan Family united. That’s the bigger picture.” 
Malani, who founded the app along with Gurayah and Chief Technology Officer Rob Ryan, met Gurayah at the Kappa Sigma fraternity at USC. Gurayah approached Malani about the idea for the app, and invited him to join the team in 2018, a year after Malani graduated from USC. 
Malani said Gurayah originally created the idea and centralized it. By outsourcing it to a team of developers, through fundraising money from friends and family, he was able to create the first version of the app. After that, Malani was brought on board for marketing and aesthetic appeal insights and branding product design. 
“He basically drew the designs on pieces of paper and kind of made his vision into a reality, which most entrepreneurs don’t do,” Malani said. “People don’t execute on their ideas, and I’m just really proud of him for making something like that was such a risky, scary thing to do and he actually did it. ”
The app, previously known as iMidas Touch, changed its name to Mydas to make it simpler and more appealing to the Gen Z market, according to Malani. The app underwent an update and full rebranding at the end of last year.
Caroline Bellamy, a Mydas social media intern, found out about the app at the Start-Up career fair last semester and said the convenience of Mydas appealed to her.
“I just thought that their whole idea and concept was just really important and something easy that students need,” said Bellamy, a sophomore majoring in public relations. “Like the idea of an electric business card and AirDropping just all of your info at once so you don’t [have to] type it in.”
The company routinely posts polls and questions on its Instagram page to filter feedback for the app in order to create the perfect app for USC students, Malani said. 
From Malani’s USC coursework experience on market testing, he has tested over 500 students on certain aspects of the company. The company has been able to make improvements to this feedback in quick time following the suggestions. 
“We’re here to make the Trojan network digital,” Malani said. “We’re here to make the process of exchanging multiple social media accounts faster, and we’re here to make it easier for people to join groups and circles and friendships.”
While many confuse it for a social media app, Malani said Mydas  is a tool that allows people to gain more followers, interests and relationships within a professional environment. 
“[We’re the platform] if you want to grow your base,” Malani said. “You want to share your voice, you want to build job opportunities, you want to build new friends — that will never change with us, that will always be the core principle of Mydas.”
According to Malani, future plans include making the app more centralized. 
“The bigger vision we have, especially here at USC, is people joining different communities, building actual lifelong connections with each other,” Gurayah said.

The Daily Trojan recently published an op-ed written by Ramona Amely, titled, “On-Campus Job Fairs Lack Career Diversity.” The writer addressed a concern with the variety of employers that recruit on campus. On behalf of the USC Career Center, I would like to describe the range of employers that recruit our Trojans through our on-campus recruiting events.   
USC has a robust and decentralized network of career services: The central Career Center serves all USC students and alumni while our school-based career services offices serve school-specific populations. Each year the Career Center, along with the school-based career services offices, offers an abundance of on-campus recruiting events, services and programs designed to provide students with ample opportunities to meet, network and engage with a variety of employers.  
The Career Center offers two general career fairs each academic year (fall and spring) that are open to all USC students and alumni, which are broad in the scope of participating industries. During our Fall 2019 Career Fair, we had more than 200 employers participate, representing more than 20 different industries, such as accounting, advertising, architecture, banking, computer science, consulting, education, fashion, government, health/medicine, insurance, marketing, real estate and technology. 
The Career Center also hosts Investigate Internships and Industries each semester covering a range of industries, such as Entertainment, TV and Sports; Policy, Sustainability and Transportation; and Healthcare, Biotechnology and Sciences.  Additionally, the Career Center oversees our USC China Career Services office, which provides opportunities for students at many of the top organizations in China through several summer and winter career fairs in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. As such, “on campus” is not just limited to the University Park or Health Sciences campuses; our students are able to meet with employers across the country and globally.  
Because there is such a range of how and where employers recruit Trojans, we cannot conclude a lack of variety among the employers that recruit on campus based on a single career fair. (We are still in the midst of inviting employers to participate in the upcoming Spring Career Fair on Feb. 6.) Another great advantage that USC students have are the school-based career services offices’ industry-specific career fairs and other on-campus recruiting events that augment the variety of USC’s employers. 
The school-based career services offices host industry-specific on-campus events, which are often limited to students at their school. For example, Viterbi School of Engineering hosts two large tech career fairs each academic year for our engineering students. School of Cinematic Arts also offers two career fairs every academic year with wide-ranging entertainment companies. Netflix, Hulu, Pixar, Warner Bros. Pictures, ABC, NBC, Fox, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Paramount, Universal, Sony, Youtube, Buzzfeed and Google Creative Lab are some of the employers that recruit through Cinematic Arts. Furthermore, they offer many other events where their students can meet with employers (e.g., monthly career talks, the “First Jobs” program, “Talent Week,” etc.).  
Since USC hosts so many different recruiting events, employers from certain industries may be more inclined to attend the niche school-based career fairs depending on the targeted skill sets and experiences that they are seeking in candidates. For example, certain tech companies will recruit only through a Viterbi-sponsored career fair because they are exclusively hiring computer science majors. Nevertheless, the Career Center hosts many tech employers in our career fairs (there were 40 at the Fall Career Fair) because employers see the benefit of recruiting at events that draw from the vast array of our student talent; our larger events also attract the highest number of students.  
As another example, most accounting firms, especially the Big Four, will participate in Leventhal’s “Meet the Firms” and will not attend the Career Center’s career fairs.  However, these firms participate in the Career Center’s On-Campus Recruiting Program because Leventhal does not conduct an OCR program.  This highlights that different employers choose to participate in various Career Center and school-based events. 
The Career Center devotes significant time and effort to connect with and outreach to employers to meet the varied career interests of all of our students. We also host career fairs targeted to specific student populations, including the International Students Career Fair, Veterans and Military Families Recruiting Night and “Diversity Meet-and-Greet” because we deeply value the diversity among our students. Thus, we strongly encourage each student to explore all the career resources available from the Career Center as well as the school-based career services offices. Fight On!

The Daily Trojan published an article titled, “Los Angeles must strengthen its environmental goals,” last semester, arguing that L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti had fallen short in their environmental efforts. According to the report card issued by the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA, it becomes clear that L.A. suffers from a stutter in the form of “C…C…C,” meaning the City of Angels received an overall grade of “C” in almost every category. 
The article goes on to state USC’s environmental efforts and describe the University’s Sustainability 2020 Plan. While many may look to the government and school administration in forwarding sustainability efforts, it is ultimately the student-run environmental organizations that truly show the work and sincerity of those behind the environmental movement. 
Today, many students actively participate in the modern environmental movement, yet one always wonders if those who march in the climate strikes really do understand the full spectrum of problems concerning sustainability. The best way for students to understand the issues they march in defiance for is to learn from other students through dialogue. USC’s Environmental Student Assembly understands this concept. 
ESA has made its agenda clear by supporting the transit subsidy that offers 50% off public transit expenses for USC staff and faculty early on, allowing them to ditch their cars. Additionally, ESA organized the climate strike at USC which was “nine times more attended than the previous demonstration because of a revamped public awareness campaign.” ESA contends that, in meetings with administration officials, the strike is constantly referenced as evidence of unprecedented student interest in making the University more eco-friendly. 
The camaraderie between the student-run environmental organizations at USC is admirable and evident in how they uplift each other’s mutual sustainability goals. Environmental clubs are not afraid to brag about each other’s achievements just as the ESA did about Bloom Boutique, a student run organization that aims to take on the issue of fast fashion. 
Fast fashion, or the production of cheap quality clothes at a cheap price, is an unsustainable way of shopping and creating textiles, as the clothes are designed to last only one season, made of material that depletes the Earth’s resources and are then disposed of in a non-sustainable fashion. The clothes are made in sweatshops, which primarily hire women laborers who are underpaid and mistreated. 
Bloom Boutique aims to provide an affordable and sustainable alternative to fast fashion by selling thrift-shop clothes while giving its proceeds to local shelters. Clubs such as Bloom Boutique wish to change the clothing habits of college students who wear clothes from outlets that may not be sustainable. Outlets, such as Zara and Asos, have been notoriously known to have unsustainable materials in their clothing products. 
Clover is another club attributing to the Green Movement. It aims to improve the sustainability of student diets by advocating for more plant-based eating. During Fall 2019, Clover and ESA held the first vegan tailgate before the Oregon football game, giving out more than 200 beyond burgers with much acclaim for the taste and its vegan authenticity. 
The biggest environmental club effort for the upcoming spring semester is to advocate for the University to “disclose, divest, and reinvest its endowment holdings in the fossil fuel industry.” ESA will also work on reducing meat consumption in dining halls, increasing recycling and integrating sustainability education in the General Education curriculum. It plans to hold another climate strike Jan. 27 focused on fossil fuel divestment.
One may wonder if other environmental clubs at major universities in L.A. feel the same way in spreading their message. In asking for UCLA’s Student Wellness Commission Environmental Awareness, Recycling, and Terrestrial Health club to comment about their efforts to include students, the club declined to comment for this article on their sustainability efforts. These attitudes contradict the overall goal of the green movement. If the goal of sustainability clubs is to spread awareness, then SWC EARTH has massively failed. 
Their response is, at its ideological base, hypocritical and, at its leadership level, lazy and immature. It is important for USC environmental clubs to take note of SWC Earth’s hypocrisy so that ESA, Clover, Bloom Boutique and others do not fall into the morass of mediocrity nor flounder in the arbitrary ways of hedonism. Taking all this into account, one can easily see that the green clubs of USC are the gold standard of environmental clubs in the immediate L.A. area and are sincerely dedicated to their mission to add green to the red and gold of USC.

At the Los Angeles Women’s March last weekend, people carried pink coat hangers. They made a cute accessory, hanging on bag straps, belt loops and pinky fingers. They were printed with the warning, “This is not a surgical instrument,” alluding to the scores of women who have been reduced to the self-mutilation of a coat-hanger abortion. 
Just a few streets over, a separate anti-abortion parade marched with posters of fetuses that looked like babies. They marched with the same argument conceived by anti-abortion groups in the 1950s — that abortion is tantamount to killing a baby. 
These parades should be a strange sight, given that the decisive Supreme Court ruling on abortion was settled nearly half a century ago. But the issue is no less contentious today, with more than 200 Congress members just recently asking the Court to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and return the issue to the states. 
While most issues would have been mediated in some way after all this time — or at least resolved with changing generations — abortion has managed to stick around. Maybe this is because the issue is so ideologically fraught, with either side being able to claim the moral high ground over the other. A woman’s right to choose is inalienable, and restrictions on that right don’t lead to fewer abortions, only more dangerous ones. Among countries without legal abortion, 30,000 women die each year from unsafe and often brutal procedures. 
At the same time, the pro-choice position argues that abortion is infanticide, a crime equivalent to leaving one’s baby in a dumpster. With the issue set in these opposing and immovable arguments, we haven’t found an acceptable middle ground that does not lend itself to murder on one side and murder on the other. 
We also can’t hope for the issue to resolve itself with the passing generation. According to a Gallup poll, “Young adults were slightly more likely than all other age groups, including seniors, to say abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.” 
It is clear that the fight over abortion is here to stay — it has become a centerpiece of our politics, with 17% of Americans being single-issue anti-abortion voters. The issue seems intractable, with no workable compromise between the two sides of an unbudgeable debate. 
The solution does not lie in convincing those who are pro-choice that their position is wrong because, truthfully, the argument for preserving fetal life has merits. A fetus can taste food by week 16 and may begin crying by week 28. To abort past a certain point becomes morally questionable and, with every passing day of a pregnancy, the degree of moral doubt deepens. 
The question then centers on where to draw that line between a “living being” and “clump of cells.” Any such line would be arbitrary, as pregnancy is a gradual process with no innate partitions — but that hasn’t stopped the courts from attempting to do so. The Roe v. Wade decision made the distinction between the first and second trimester, the point past which a fetus may survive outside the womb. 
As for the question of whether that line should exist at all, there is much debate. Babies are not, as President Donald Trump has repeated, “executed” by doctors and mothers post birth. In fact, 91% of abortions are performed within the first 13 weeks of a pregnancy, and only 1.4% take place after week 21, often due to fetal deformity or with regard to the mother’s safety. 
When we clear away the distortion caused by vocal minorities, the issue becomes more workable. There is a middle-ground between the two extreme ends of the debate: The right to abortion is justified, and some limits on that right are justified as well. 
This approach is supported by the majority of Americans — two-thirds of whom support access to abortion in most or all cases. 
The remaining third, who would rather heap as many restrictions to access as they can legally manage, should consider the priorities of their movement. Restrictions often lead to later abortions, rather than fewer abortions. Waiting periods, mandatory hospitalizations, parental consent —make it more likely that a woman’s abortion will occur past the dividing line. 
The goal for either side — and for anti-abortion advocates especially —should be to foster the earliest and easiest abortion possible. Though the debate over the rights and humanity of a developing fetus is perhaps too indomitable to ever be resolved, we can still come to policies that most reasonable people will accept. 
Abortion is morally difficult, which is why the issue hasn’t found a resolution in the past 50 years. I have no proposals for what acceptable policies might look like, only suggestions to the opponents of abortion.

Candidates for the Undergraduate Student Government 2020-21 academic year were announced online Tuesday. Four pairs of presidential candidates and 17 senatorial candidates, including six pairs running joint campaigns, were announced on USG’s election website. 
Current USG Senior Director of Communications Truman Fritz and Sen. Rose Ritch are among those running for president and vice president. 
Their platform emphasizes changing the culture of mental and academic health on campus, creating physical spaces for minority groups and increasing student accessibility to the administration through a student feedback platform. 
“We know that there’s a mental health crisis; we felt it ourselves,” Fritz said. “[We] know that there’s not enough support, there’s not enough resources on our campus today, there’s not enough money that’s going to fixing this problem that we all are feeling, and we want to work to change that.”
Sen. Christopher McMorran and his running mate Trinity Lee will focus their presidential campaign on improving student access to public transportation. 
“I think [the transportation program] is super important as a platform point for accessibility and affordability for students as well as sustainability and environmental stewardship,” McMorran said. “It also helps build relations with our surrounding community by getting students off campus more. I think it sort of checks all the boxes that we want to check with our campaign.” 
They also plan to continue USG’s free legal counseling and want to expand the free blue books and HIV testing programs. 
“Our big thing is that we want to prioritize student services with our budgeting,” McMorran said. “[We’re] really making sure that we’re spending our money on things that directly improve the basic needs of students.” 
Despite coming from different backgrounds, Marketing Assistant Director Christine Nguyen and Miles Kay, who is new to USG, partnered up because of their mutual passion for service. Their platform includes establishing school-specific mental health initiatives, creating a campus culture that breaks the stigma of disabilities and enacting new sustainability programs such as reducing food waste and conserving water. 
“The thing that connects the two of us is that we’re both so dedicated to service in whichever communities that we are a part of,” Nguyen said. “We are just two individuals who have very different perspectives, especially with [Kay]. He has never been in USG before, so he really brings with him value and perspective from being outside of the organization but still having that same passion, fire and dedication for service, which is so important and integral to the mission of USG as a whole.”
Sen. Sara Khoshniyati and Philanthropy Fund Assistant Director Rohit Bolla’s campaign revolves around ensuring that students’ voices are heard. Their platform includes initiatives to expand the free Lyft program and create a Student Health Center-sponsored monthly check-in program. 
“As president and vice president, we really want to push a platform that advocates for all students and creates equal opportunities,” Khoshniyati said. 
Bolla said he and Khoshniyati hope to broaden extracurricular opportunities with their platform initiatives, which include grants for arts students to alleviate out-of-pocket expenses.
“We want people to be empowered in their experience here at USC, both academic and nonacademic, so just leveling the playing field by giving people who might not have access to those kinds of supplies and resources could still give them the same leg up as everyone else,” Bolla said.
Each presidential ticket provided a joint statement and a description of its campaign platform on the USG election webpage. 
Seventeen senatorial candidates are running for 12 open senator positions. Lennon Wesley III, Cathy Ding, Isabel Washington, Dario Arganese and Kevin Gutierrez are running solo campaigns. 
Alexis Areias and Max Gomez; Gabriel Savage and Ruben Romeo; Joshua Wigler and Shreya Chanda; Julian Lin and Trinity Moore; Mayra Rodriguez and Nate Manor; and Jonathan Kamanta and Vadim Trubetskoy are running joint campaigns. 
Candidates running for USG will be campaigning until voting begins Feb. 11.

The University held the first two of eight town halls to initiate open dialogue and better understand the USC Culture Journey Tuesday in response to results from the USC Values Poll administered last Fall. The town halls will be accompanied by at least 60 more intimate discussion sessions. 
The culture sessions will be led by Barrett Values Centre, an external consultant chosen by the University after two years of research, which will share the high-level results of the USC Values Poll. Sabrina Pasztor, the director of USC Culture Transformation, has been working closely with the Office of Culture, Ethics and Compliance since last year to understand and improve USC’s culture. 
“I think there are a lot of contributing factors to where we are today,” Pasztor said. “Part of that is that over the course of the past three to four years, USC has undergone a considerable amount of things that aren’t necessarily the newsworthy things that we know we can be recognized for.” 
The USC Values Poll had 19,756 participants across staff, faculty and students, with a 27.4% participation rate. 
“Since we had almost 20,000 people contribute to the poll, the plan was always to then have additional opportunities for cultural conversations, like town halls and discussion sessions that are at the USC-wide level, and then we’re actually going to have those school by school and unit by unit as well,” Pasztor said. 
The event commenced with a welcome speech from Stacy Giwa, the vice president of the Office of Ethics and Compliance. Giwa presented a video from President Carol Folt highlighting her vision for values and culture and then introduced Charles Holmes and Annalise Jennings from Barrett Values Centre, who explained and analyzed the poll results.
Jennings explained that, in addition to providing expertise from Barrett Values Centre, she and Holmes have been training faculty and staff within USC to lead the discussion sessions. There are currently 44 people who have completed intensive four-day training and 80 who have completed two days of advocate training. 
“This isn’t something that ends in a year,” Jennings said. “It doesn’t end in two years. It never ends. So we have to invest in our people to facilitate ongoing conversations.”
Mable Johnson, a project specialist in the USC Human Resources Division, was one of the staff members in the audience.
“I’m excited to see the changes that come out of this,” Johnson said.	
Jennings and Holmes broke down the results of the USC Values Poll from an expert perspective, categorizing the responses based on the three parts of the poll: current culture, desired culture and personal values. They presented the top 10 selected terms identified for each category. 
“Trojan Family” was the most selected term in the current culture category, “accountability” in desired culture and “hardworking” in personal values. “Compassion,” an ideal highlighted in the presentation, was the second most chosen value across the three parts. 
Nancy Lu, a graduate student studying journalism, attended the meeting to become more involved in the USC community. 
“It shows unity,” Lu said. “I’ve never experienced this, so I think it’s cool. Maybe I should attend another session to learn more about it.”
Paul Menker, a graduate student studying physics, said he was optimistic about the potential for progress.
“At first I was a little bit cynical — it felt like a lot of buzzwords with very little substance,” Menker said. “I think when we got more into the data, I saw some value in being able to analyze more specifically what’s good or bad … I don’t think this specifically is enough to instill change, but I think you need a clear vision of where you are before you know where you can go where you need to be.”

Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Mahin Tahsin presented updates on projects revolving around changes to coursework at the USG meeting Tuesday. Changes involved making THRIVE: Foundations of Well-Being a required first-year course, as well as implementing sustainability education in more courses in the general education program or within existing courses.
The student-organized THRIVE course was initially created by a USG project and is offered by the Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy. It consists of a lecture about a specific topic, such as religion or mindfulness, and a discussion in which students talk about what they learned in a smaller setting. Students meet with faculty and are tasked with stimulating their true selves and practicing self-care. 
“It’s a course that ensures that students practice well-being, and it could really improve the culture that students have or their understanding of what it means to be a student and a well-operating human,” Tahsin said.
Tahsin has begun making plans to meet with Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni to add THRIVE to the freshman course sequence. 
“Given that it’s already a class that exists, the next steps would generally be working with Dean Soni, working with the provost’s office and working with all the academic deans to figure out how we can implement it into this curriculum for all students,” she said. 
Tahsin also prioritized incorporating sustainability education into University-wide coursework, including more general education courses with environmental focuses. 
“The sustainability education is still very much in the preliminary works, but we’re hoping to expand the number of sustainability-related courses that are offered in the GE program,” Tahsin said. “[There’d be] very small bits and pieces of takeaways that students can have from their courses that they already take or get offered more courses that are related to sustainability.” 
Tahsin hopes to work with the Environmental Student Assembly and other campus organizations to create a proposal to present to University administration. 
“I just think that generally, students can learn more about how their day-to-day affects the world around them,” Tahsin said. “It’s how the changing environment is affecting your allergies and stuff like that, which are very relevant and important for everyone to know, and how they can take a part in changing that and being involved in the change process for the entire world.”
Sen. Emily Donahue also gave a presentation on her ongoing projects. Tahsin, Sens. Emily Johnson and Omar Garcia and another representative will be presenting their proposal for a first-generation student resource center to President Carol Folt and Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp in two weeks before passing a resolution of support for the creation of the center. 
Donahue, along with Sen. Christopher McMorran, will also meet with the transportation department to go over the results of last week’s undergraduate transportation survey, as well as potential next steps. The survey attempted to gauge student interest in subsidized public transportation.
The tampon initiative, which is designed to provide free feminine hygiene products to students, will be implemented in Residential Education facilities. However, Donahue said she hopes to find a way to make these products accessible outside of these spaces. 
“Most of the senators that I’ve been checking in with were like 80 to 90% done on things, so I’m really hoping to bring a lot of those projects over the finish line,” Donahue said.

As students walked up to the Caruso Catholic Center for 5 p.m. mass, they veered not toward the tall wooden doors of the church but toward the open doors of Newman Hall, where an altar was set up at the right of the room with stacked chairs forming small pews along the length of the room. 
The Catholic Center experienced a five-hour-long power outage Sunday that affected the whole facility, along with other buildings on the north side of University Park Campus including student housing. According to the center’s Director of Campus Ministry Rosie Shawver, the 5 p.m. mass had to be moved to a different room in the building where the emergency lights were on. 
“About 2 o’clock I got a message from our pastor saying that all the electricity was out … so we had to reconfigure and figure out how we’re going to make [mass] happen,” Shawver said. “I walked downstairs and I looked at [Newman Hall], and I realized that the emergency lights were on there … Thank goodness we moved it inside because outside, it would have been pitch dark.”
Students were alerted of the power outage at 2:30 p.m. through a TrojansAlert that informed students that the power was out north of 32nd Street in the area of Adams Boulevard between Magnolia Avenue and Figueroa Street. Power was restored at 7:30 p.m., although no public statement was made about the cause of the outage. 
According to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power media representative Christina Holland, the power outage was caused by a faulty overhead switch to a power pole in need of replacement. Since the outage occurred in the winter, an overload of energy usage was not possible, Holland said. 
LADWP also clarified rumors that the outage was caused by a balloon that hit the power lines. However, Holland urged individuals to be aware of how they dispose of balloons since they have caused power issues in the past. 
“Once that [metallic substance of a mylar balloon] comes in contact with the [live electricity wire], it can cause a lot of damage,” Holland said. “Sometimes it’s minor, sometimes it’s more complicated, but we don’t want our lights to go out so if people can make sure they tie them down and when they’re done with them … dispose of them properly.”
Shawver noticed that throughout the time the outage occurred, affected students were attempting to find power outlets to charge their devices. 
“I felt bad but I kept telling them to go to [USC Village] Starbucks and try to get some work done there and hopefully you can charge your stuff,” Shawver said. 
Clara Miller, a junior majoring in design, who experienced the outage in student housing on West 27th Street, said that she and her boyfriend had to think of alternatives to getting work done without Wi-Fi. 
“We started texting people in the building [if they had] power, what’s going on and no one else had power,” Miller said. “The Wi-Fi was down, which is really annoying because even to [replace the Wi-Fi] for watching stuff or even doing work, so what I did I used the hotspot I had … It was a little spotty but it worked and it brought us all the way [through the outage].”
Paulina Nuñez, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said that the outage gave her a new outlook on how having electricity is a privileged part of her life that she had previously taken for granted. 
“It made me feel really lucky that we do have power for 99% of time because a lot of people don’t have power in a lot of places,” Nuñez said. “People still keep living [without power], and it seems like it’s falling apart when it really wasn’t, it’s just hard to adjust.”
Miller said she had not been informed of the cause of the power outage and believes that the University should keep students updated with information regarding such events and develop preventative measures in student housing if an outage were to occur again. 
“I think [USC Housing] should have at least backup generators, [because] stuff like this could happen a lot, especially in places where there are earthquakes,” Miller said. “We should also know what happened just to know [if it] was something really complicated was it a one-time thing or is it something that could be repeated … There’s so many different housing areas around USC that it’s hard to really take care of all of them.”

For more than two decades, the Screen Actors Guild Awards have brought Hollywood’s most talented and glamorous performers to the Shrine Auditorium to celebrate the best performances in film and television. Last Sunday, the 26th SAG Awards followed suit and once again created a classy ceremony honoring the great work from this past year. 
For its 26th year, the award show returned to its roots by going hostless,  streamlining the broadcast by putting a greater focus on the talent and performances. To fill the void of a host, Dan and Eugene Levy of “Schitt’s Creek” greeted the star-studded crowd with a witty monologue. However, they made sure to clarify that they were not the hosts, as they were not being paid. Throughout the night, other select actors shared stories of their earliest Hollywood memories, serving as inspiration to young actors. 
The night was filled with surprises, especially on the television side. While Tony Shalhoub (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (“Fleabag”) were expected surefire wins for Best Male and Female Actors in a Comedy Series, it was the Drama Series and Miniseries categories that had the greatest upsets. Perhaps the night’s biggest surprise was Jennifer Aniston winning Best Female Actor for “The Morning Show,” which has received mixed reviews since its release. Not only was it an upset for Olivia Colman (“The Crown”) and Jodie Comer (“Killing Eve”), but it was the first big victory for Apple+. Aniston expressed shock during her acceptance speech and ended with a warm shout out to Adam Sandler for his performance in “Uncut Gems.” 
Peter Dinklage finally won an award for his masterful performance as Tyrion Lannister in the final season of “Game of Thrones,” and while Michelle Williams was a lock to win for “Fosse/Verdon,” her costar Sam Rockwell rocked the second biggest unanticipated win of the night as Best Male Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries, beating frontrunner Jharrel Jerome (“When They See Us”).
For the best ensemble categories, “The Crown” won for Drama Series, one of the toughest categories of the evening. And for the final shocker in the television categories, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” beat out its sister frontrunner Amazon series, “Fleabag.” While Amazon was still the winner, the cast was definitely shocked at the win. 
“I voted for Fleabag,” actress Alex Borstein said. “This is definitely weird. This makes no sense!” 
Many of her costars nodded  in agreement.  
On the film side of the ceremony, most of the categories had clear frontrunners who had been burning through award season. As many expected, Laura Dern won for Best Supporting Actress for her fiery performance as a divorce attorney in “Marriage Story.” She gave a gracious speech after hugging her father, actor Bruce Dern, on the way to the stage. While her win was practically a guarantee, there were some who had hoped that Jennifer Lopez would take home the award for her role in “Hustlers” after not receiving an Oscars nomination. Meanwhile, Renée Zellweger won for Best Lead Actress for her performance as film and music legend Judy Garland in the self-titled biopic, “Judy.”
For the men, the funniest and most honest speech of the night came from Brad Pitt, who snagged Best Supporting Actor for his suave portrayal of stuntman Cliff Booth in Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” 
“Let’s be honest, it was a difficult part. A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn’t get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,” Pitt said, jokingly. 
Joaquin Phoenix took home the Best Actor prize for his performance in “Joker” as the troubled title character, beating out Adam Driver’s work in “Marriage Story.” In his humble speech, he praised his fellow nominees graciously before thanking his favorite actor, the late Heath Ledger, who took home the Oscar for the same role in the seminal film, “The Dark Knight.” 
When it came to the final award of the night, Best Film Ensemble, it was up for any one of several great films to take the prize. There were no frontrunners or easy locks, but SAG was clear in its fondness for the South Korean masterpiece, “Parasite.” When the cast presented its film earlier that night, the entire room gave them a standing ovation. So, it only makes sense that the talented cast that created the film would win the night’s biggest award. Their electric and charming personalities came across even through a translator in their humbling speech. 
The  win made history as the first foreign-language film to win Best Film Ensemble, making the Oscar race for Best Picture even more unpredictable. While films such as “1917,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and “The Irishman” are gunning for the top prize, “Parasite” may prove to be the dark horse that takes it all. 
Aside from those highlights, the SAG Awards were classy and celebratory as ever. Pop culture icons “Avengers: Endgame” and “Game of Thrones” made their presence known through their Stunt Ensemble wins. 
Maybe the best moment of the night was Leonardo DiCaprio’s respectful, personal speech to Robert De Niro for his Lifetime Achievement Award. DiCaprio recounted De Niro’s greatest achievements as well as his own childhood experience of studying the masterful actor when watching “Midnight Run” in theaters with his father. While De Niro’s acceptance speech remained muted on the award, he gave strong words supporting unionization and fighting the current political climate.
As one of the most important nights on the road to the Academy Awards, the 26th Screen Actors’ Guild Awards did not disappoint this year with its palpable communal energy among its actors.

There is no right answer for releasing posthumous music — a sentiment expressed by the family of rapper Mac Miller who died in 2018 from an accidental overdose. But his latest and possibly final album might be the blueprint for bringing music to life after death. 
Outside countless legal and ethical issues that could arise, seemingly most important is how authentic the music is to the artist. Easily, the Notorious B.I.G.’s posthumous “Life After Death” comes to mind. The continuation of his debut “Ready to Die” had finished baking. There was little guessing as to his vision for the songs, and in turn, Bad Boy churned out a hip-hop classic.
In more recent times, we’ve seen the late rapper XXXTentacion attend his own funeral in the posthumous music video for his song “Sad!” and the BMW that X was last seen alive in was on display at an official album release event. 
With “Sad!” he became the first act to earn a posthumous Hot 100 No. 1 single as a lead artist since B.I.G’s “Mo Money Mo Problems.” Still, the rollout of his music has been painted as distasteful, given his untimely death at age 20 in 2018 after being shot and killed in a robbery. 
Despite the critics, the music grappled with themes of death and self-reflection, which populated his work before his passing. Arguably the music released hasn’t strayed from the trajectory of his career.
Mac Miller’s Jan. 17 release isn’t one for critics to rip apart for inconsistencies or for fans to be disappointed with. There’s no question the vocals are his, unlike tracks on Michael Jackson’s 2010 release, “Michael,” or issues as to whether or not he wanted the music to come to light. “Circles” is a blessing, not only because it sits as another gem in the rapper’s discography but because it existed under the perfect set of conditions for a release. 
According to his family, this posthumous project was “well into the process of recording” at the time of Miller’s death. In a statement released on the late rapper’s Instagram account, his family described Friday’s release and his previous album ‘Swimming” as “two different styles complementing each other, completing a circle — Swimming in Circles was the concept.”
With consideration of the project’s history, it is no wonder it’s not only characteristic of his discography but the perfect next step. Hip-hop grew up with Mac Miller, seeing him go from cheeky but smart bars (think his early mixtape “K.I.D.S.”) to jazz-influenced production habitual of an artist several years his senior; “Circles” continues that narrative. 
Producer Jon Brion, who worked on “Circles” before Miller’s death, was tasked with the most difficult of responsibilities; doing justice to Mac Miller’s discography. Even though it was already in production, how does one use old lyrics to fit the context and stylings of today’s music? How do you successfully add value to an artist’s existing bodies of work? Posthumous music can be a nightmare to anyone involved because the legacy of the dead ultimately rests on their shoulders. 
Despite the seemingly insurmountable task, Jon Brion completed the album gloriously. “Circles” doesn’t try to fit a blueprint for what music in 2020 should sound like — it just sounds like Mac Miller. It exists in no time period, no “era” of rap but is situated somewhere in his evolution as an artist. Ultimately, “Circles” is where he was as an artist at the time of his death. And with the quality of work at hand, there is no guessing Mac had many years ahead of him. 
The album is almost eerie, not only because it sounds as if Miller was in the studio for the final mixing and mastering but because of continued conversations on uncertainty heard in his previous releases. 
“The Devine Feminine”’s “Stay” touches on uncertainty in his relationships similar to “Circles”’ single “Good News,” where he raps “there’s a whole lot more for me waiting on the other side.” During the 48 minutes it plays, we’re gifted with what sounds like a song in 12 parts; or better yet, an end credit song in a blockbuster movie about the prolific rapper. 
Aside from the lyrical content and on-brand production, the cautious rollout of “Circles” cannot go unmentioned. His family, label and collaborators didn’t flirt with the media. There was silence leading up to the release of the first single “Good News” and then the full album “Circles.” 
Just as B.I.G.’s death didn’t stop him from being regarded as one of the greatest rappers, Miller’s death didn’t halt a legacy of uniquely profound and personal music. “Circles,” although a bittersweet listening experience, is everything we’d expect from a Mac Miller album. 
He raps on the track “Blue World:” “F*ck the bullsh*t, I’m here to make it all better, “with a little music for you.” And that he did.

“The juice” is a term that has become popular among the members of the USC football team in recent years, and no, it’s not a reference to the nickname of a certain former Trojan running back who got into some trouble a while back. 
One definition of the phrase on Urban Dictionary is “A type of energy emitted from those of great power and potential.” It’s also frequently used to describe someone or something who inspires that type of energy in those around them.
It’s ironic that “the juice” has caught on with the football team just as the University’s premier program may be getting bypassed in both performance and popularity.
During the same year that USC football failed to draw a five-star prospect and ranks a dismal 10th in the Pac-12 in recruiting according to 247Sports, USC basketball earned a commitment from the No. 1 recruit in the country — Evan Mobley — and is in the race for the conference title. But the difference in positivity for the two programs is about more than just numbers; it comes down to the basketball team’s edge in the ineffable quality that the football team has misguidedly co-opted.
The Trojans’ last two contests at Galen Center have provided a glimpse into just how fun — and good — this team could be. The squad’s veterans stepped up in an 88-56 demolition of Cal Thursday as senior and redshirt senior guards Jonah Mathews and Daniel Utomi combined for 36 points on 7-for-11 shooting from downtown. 
Two days later, the team’s talented youngsters took the reigns. Freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu dropped 22 points, and sophomore guard Elijah Weaver hit a game-tying 3-pointer to tie Stanford in the final seconds before finishing an and-one layup in overtime to secure a win that featured a 21-point second-half comeback.
USC hit many encouraging benchmarks just in this two-game stretch. It showed it can blow out inferior teams without letting them hang around. By handing Stanford its first conference loss, the Trojans proved they can hang with good teams and moved into a tie with the Cardinal for first place in the conference. 
But most importantly, USC proved it could dig deep and capture the devotion of its fanbase by completing that big comeback Saturday.
Galen got progressively louder as the second half wore on, becoming almost deafening when Weaver sunk the three to tie the game with under 10 seconds left. When Weaver missed the go-ahead free throw, it didn’t deflate the crowd. Instead, the fans brought the same raucousness they had demonstrated all game long to overtime. It was a capstone moment for the team, and the fan reaction is a big reason why.
Before you dismiss the importance of positive energy around a team, consider the football program. As USC fell to depressing lows in 2018 and crawled up to mediocrity in 2019, the entire fanbase turned sour. I have my frustrations about how fickle the “Trojan Faithful” can be, but the program didn’t do much to garner any favor when it got blown out by Iowa in the Holiday Bowl before deciding that a head coach with a 13-12 record the last two seasons had done enough to keep his job.
Allowing 49 points to a plodding Iowa team that averaged 20 points per game against Power 5 opponents to that point was a humiliating cherry on top of the depression sundae that has been the last two years at University Park. USC fans are fed up, as evidenced by their tireless efforts to fill athletic director Mike Bohn and President Carol Folt’s Twitter replies with as much hate as possible. Attendance is already down at the Coliseum, and more and more fans are threatening to sell their season tickets.
That stuff affects the players. Trust me, they know their fanbase isn’t 100% behind them; how could they not with reporters asking about the angst around the team after every practice and game? 
It’s hard to play your best with that knowledge. I have no doubt that it’s part of the reason the team hasn’t played well the last 20 games or so, and it’s definitely a huge factor in USC missing out on top recruits. Meanwhile, USC basketball had the seventh-ranked recruiting class in 2019, the best in the history of the program.
The basketball team showcased an ability to captivate its supporters Saturday in a way the football team hasn’t since the sweet, sweet days of Sam Darnold. As the Trojans have worked their way to a 15-3 record this season, the jokes that USC is now a basketball school have increased at a healthy rate, but that really isn’t too far from being a possibility.
If the Trojans can make it into the NCAA Tournament, make a solid run and then carry that momentum into next season with Mobley arriving to elevate the program, the football team will need to make marked improvements to maintain its status as the face of the University.
There’s still a long way to go for USC basketball. Apart from Stanford, the Trojans beat three bad opponents in the Pac-12 and got boat raced at Washington in their only other matchup against a quality team. Head coach Andy Enfield has proven that his teams can fail in spite of strong talent, even in a mediocre Pac-12. The conference also has stronger teams this season, like No. 23 Colorado, No. 22 Arizona and No. 12 Oregon, whom the Trojans face in Eugene Thursday.
That matchup with the Ducks could easily end in a blowout loss that almost instantly makes this column outdated, but the Trojans have the capability of hanging with the conference’s best team. 
The energy the players had following the victory over Stanford is representative of a team that has a little extra oomph. Don’t be shocked if USC brings “the juice” to Oregon tomorrow.

A pioneer of her specific brand of dark electro pop, Isabella de Montesquiou’s career is only just beginning to take off.
The Thornton senior, who goes by the stage name of IZZA, started playing the piano when she was 5 years old, with a focus on classical music. Soon after, she realized that it was not her calling but later discovered songwriting in her teenage years and used it as an outlet to express herself.
“When you’re in your teenage years, you’re trying to figure out how to navigate friendships, different relationships and just life in general,” de Montesquiou said. “So I just turned to writing [lyrics] and then those turned into songs, and I haven’t stopped since because it’s just so therapeutic to me to just write a song about what’s going on in my life and I just have so much clarity when I’m writing music.”
Although de Montesquiou would characterize her genre as dark electro hip-hop, she takes inspiration from pop and rock music as well.
“Kanye [West] has always been my favorite artist and someone I really look up to as a musician because of his ability to just transform himself through every album but stay true to himself as an artist,” de Montesquiou said. 
When writing her music, de Montesquiou carefully crafts her lyrics before putting together the melody. The lyrics she writes stem from all the emotions she experiences in her daily life.
“I’ll feel a certain way if I’m having a bad time with somebody or heartbreak, or I deal with depression and anxiety so I want my music to talk about mental health because I know that music nowadays doesn’t necessarily do that, but I think mental health is super important to talk about so I definitely talk a lot about my internal struggles,” she said. 
De Montesquiou finds it important to remain completely authentic in her music and to accurately portray raw emotions without glorifying them so that listeners are able to relate.
“I really enjoy writing about the good times too,” de Montesquiou said. “I like contrasting the two because that’s reality since not everything is going to be great 100% of the time and not everything is going to be bad 100% of the time.”
Music video producer and director Edwin Franko, a 2019 USC graduate, has known de Montesquiou since 2018 and is currently working with her on a music video for her upcoming track.
“She’s building a sound that is so unique that it’s hard to find someone to compare her to,” Franko said.
He hopes to continue collaborating with de Montesquiou in the future while also helping her find her unique voice. 
“She understands the music business and understands branding and she’s just creating a sound that’s different and I just really like it,” Franko said.
Skylar Jones, a USC alumna, met de Montesquiou in a songwriting class last year and became her producer. Their chemistry and ability to work well with each other have given Jones and de Montesquiou all the tools they need to continue their professional partnership, Jones said.
“I’m pretty excited for our future working together,” Jones said. “I always go back and forth between creating music and the cool thing about IZZA is that she always finds a way to get me back into action about making music some way or another.”

After losing to Iowa in the Holiday Bowl and posting an 8-5 record, USC football is struggling to meet the lofty expectations of its fans once again with a relatively disappointing 2020 recruiting season — though there are certainly some bright spots.
Recently retained head coach Clay Helton and recently extended offensive coordinator Graham Harrell have corralled the 57th ranked recruiting class in the nation, rightfully ahead of programs such as Wake Forest, Syracuse and East Carolina but behind others like Vanderbilt, Duke and Cincinnati, per 247Sports. USC ranks third to last in recruiting among Pac-12 football programs.
The Trojans’ 2020 recruiting class is headlined by four-star Centennial wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr., who announced his commitment to USC Jan. 4 at the All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas, and enrolled on Jan. 7. The Corona native is ranked as the nation’s 57th best overall player — the sixth best in California — and as the nation’s  eighth best receiver.
Bryant noted that USC’s Air Raid passing game was a major factor in his decision to pick the Trojans over other competitive programs like Arizona State, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington.
“[USC] just feels like home for me,” Bryant said immediately after announcing his commitment. “They have an Air Raid offense that I feel I could go in there and play big at.”
Moorpark offensive guard Jonah Monheim is the second and last four-star recruit in USC’s class, but far from the last offensive lineman, as Helton has recruited six in total this offseason. 
Apart from Monheim, Courtland Ford, Caadyn Stephen, Casey Collier, Andrew Milek and Andres Dewerk are all three-star recruits. All six come from west of the Mississippi River, and only Monheim, Ford and Stephen are nationally ranked.
“I think [there were] a lot of factors,” Monheim said about his commitment decision. “It was the history of being a great program, I think it was staying close to home and having family nearby; it was the great academics that USC offers.”
These qualities of USC football — history, weather, proximity and academics — have attracted top recruits for decades. But recent struggles, as well as a perceived instability within the program, have contributed toward USC losing the recruiting stronghold it once had in the region and Pac-12.
“It was 10, 12 years ago where we were fortunate enough to be a part of championship teams [at USC],” former Trojan quarterback, national champion and Heisman Award winner Matt Leinart said on FOX’s College Football pre-Holiday Bowl show. “The consistency isn’t there for the fanbase and the alumni, and they’re upset.”
The second ranked recruit in the class of 2019, weakside defensive end Kayvon Thibodeaux, is a nearby Thousand Oaks native who was widely considered a lock to join USC’s recruiting class, but he committed to Oregon. 
Likewise, fourth ranked 2020 recruit Justin Flowe, an inside linebacker from Upland, signed with Oregon on Dec. 18 — National Signing Day. 
Mater Dei quarterback Bryce Young, the top quarterback in the 2020 class and the fifth best player nationally, was a longtime USC commit before he flipped to Alabama on Sept. 22 — though the Trojans landed five-star 2021 quarterback Jake Garcia the next day.
Other offseason developments for USC include Harrell, who was recently extended by USC, interviewing for the Philadelphia Eagles’ open offensive coordinator position. However, per Bruce Feldman of The Athletic, Harrell is expected to remain with the Trojans. 
USC also received some other good news this past week when redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Jay Tufele, redshirt sophomore offensive guard Alijah Vera-Tucker and redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns announced they would all be returning for another year at USC instead of declaring for the NFL Draft. 
USC opens its 2020 season against the Alabama Crimson Tide on Sept. 5 in Arlington, Texas.

A host of Trojans found success on the tennis courts last weekend in Thousand Oaks despite facing tough competition. The No. 3 ranked USC men’s team competed against the No. 9 Texas A&M Aggies, No. 11 UCLA Bruins and No. 12 Stanford Cardinal in the Sherwood Collegiate Cup. 
The seven Trojans participating in the tournament were No. 1 junior Daniel Cukierman, No. 9 sophomore Mor Bulis, No. 26 senior Riley Smith (only doubles), No. 37 freshman Stefan Dostanic, No. 64 freshman Ryder Jackson, No. 84 sophomore Jake Sands (only singles) and sophomore Bradley Frye. 
Cukierman won singles play by beating No. 18 sophomore Alexandre Rotsaert from Stanford in a tightly contested matchup 6-3, 4-6, 6-1. 
The junior also paired up with Smith to beat crosstown rival UCLA in a close match against No. 7 junior Keegan Smith and sophomore Govind Nanda. Cukierman and Smith won the match 7-5. 
The win marks the second tournament that the Cukierman and Smith duo has won this year, as the two Trojans won the Oracle Pro Series Tournament just over a week ago. 
Cukierman’s play, especially, garnered praise. 
“Daniel is just playing with a super high confidence level right now,” head coach Brett Masi said. “After a great fall [season], he is ranked No. 1 in the country … [It] gave him a big boost … And now coming back here and winning this first tournament to start off the spring … that’s a big boost going in the right direction.”
Masi claims Cukierman’s consistent attitude is a big reason for his success.
“He is going out there with a sense of urgency every match, where he wants to compete hard and win,” Masi said of Cukierman’s poise. “He is leaving his legacy right now.”
Bulis, Dostanic and Jackson also fared well at the tournament. Bulis easily beat No. 54 sophomore Sangeet Sridhar from Stanford in the Round of 16 6-3, 6-1. Dostanic reached the quarterfinal before losing to his teammate Cukierman 6-2, 2-6, 6-1. Lastly, Jackson and Bulis reached the semifinal before falling to UCLA’s duo of Smith and Nanda 6-3.
“We had a couple good wins by Mor Bulis … He beat a good player from Stanford,” Masi said. “I’m pretty happy with a lot of the guys on the team.” 
The Trojans will need to keep proving Masi’s confidence right as they look ahead toward a season in which they still have to face the No. 2 Texas Longhorns and No. 6 Ohio State Buckeyes, along with Pac-12 foes such as UCLA, Stanford and No. 14 California. 
“Take a look at our schedule, it is jam-packed,” Masi said. “Every match is loaded … [and] every match is going to be a big one.”
USC will participate in the ITA Kickoff Weekend in Los Angeles this weekend, beginning tournament play against UNC Wilmington Saturday.
