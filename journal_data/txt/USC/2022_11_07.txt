USC graduate and former board of trustees member Thomas J. Barrack Jr. was acquitted Friday in the Eastern District of New York courthouse on charges that he illegally lobbied for the United Arab Emirates from April 2016 to April 2018.
Barrack, founder of global investment firm Colony Capital LLC, was an advisor to former President Donald Trump and chair of his 2017 Inaugural Committee. Prosecutors accused Barrack of using his political influence to promote UAE’s interests in the White House.
Barrack graduated from USC in 1969 with a bachelor’s degree and later attended Gould Law School. When he was arrested in July 2021, Barrack resigned from the USC Board of Trustees, a role he had been serving since 2012.
Barrack pleaded not guilty on nine counts, including acting as an unregistered agent for a foreign government, obstruction of justice and making false statements. 
According to an International Business Times report, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn claimed that Emirati sovereign wealth funds invested $374 million in Barrack’s private investment firm, Colony Capital LLC, in 2017 and 2018. 
However, Barrack testified that sovereign wealth funds from other countries in the Middle East, such as Qatar and Kuwait, played a more significant role in the development of his firm than those from the UAE. 
Barrack’s defense mentioned his close relationship with Qatar, UAE’s political rival in the region, to prove his independence from the UAE. 
In 2017 UAE broke diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing the latter of supporting Islamic extremists. Qatar denied the assertion, and the two countries didn’t restore diplomatic ties until Jan. 2021. 
The Foreign Agents Registration Act, passed in 1938, requires persons representing foreign interests to register with the Department of Justice and disclose their relationship, activities and related financial compensation. To prove Barrack is guilty, prosecutors had to prove that he acted under the UAE’s direction and control.
Prosecutors offered the jurors text messages and emails that suggest Emirate officials provided feedback to Barrack on what he should say in television interviews and in an opinion article about U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. 
Barrack’s lawyers’ defense asserted that the interaction with Emirate officials was part of his job to lead Colony Capital LLC and that Barrack acted on his own will the entire time. 
After three days of deliberation, jurors reached their verdict, finding Barrack not guilty of all counts. 
“The system is amazing. People are amazing. I have no hostility, I’m just proud to be an American,” Barrack said in a Nov. 4 interview outside the courthouse.

When it comes to Joji, the question has always remained the same: 
“Who in the world saw this one coming?”
The mere existence of Joji is a testament to the terminally online era within which we currently find ourselves trapped. His 180-degree transition from edgy YouTube comedian to one of the biggest voices in alternative R&B has been a success story unique to the Internet age, where a complete character reinvention is only a keystroke away. 
But none of this would matter if the music wasn’t any good. Joji would just be another internet content creator looking to parlay his fleeting success into some semblance of a music career. However, he’s shattered that perception with some of the best R&B singles of the past few years. 
From the ‘80s-soaked “Slow Dancing in the Dark” to the brooding, explosive drama of “Run,” Joji has a handful of individual highlights that can go toe-to-toe with just about anyone in his musical lane. Crafting a cohesive, enjoyable album experience, however, has been more of a challenge. 2018’s “Ballads 1” and 2020’s “Nectar” fit snugly into alternative R&B’s lo-fi, depressive sound, but lacked the clarity of vision that the genre’s best records possess. And if “Smithereens” proves anything, it’s that Joji is still a ways away from crafting a fully-realized record. 
The first taste of “Smithereens” was the single “Glimpse of Us,” a track that is one of, if not, the best song Joji has ever released. Although balladry is certainly a factor of his music on previous albums, “Glimpse of Us” served as Joji’s first foray into straightforward soul and singer-songwriter music. The track strips his sound down to its barest and most naked form, and this sparse foundation only serves to highlight the brilliant songwriting on display. It’s truly uncommon that a song, on impact, feels like something timeless. “Glimpse of Us” is that rare example, a track whose gorgeous lead melody and tragic lyrics just hit upon something universally emotional and moving. 
The lead single, as has often been the case for Joji, had me chomping at the bit to hear the direction of this new record. And now that the album is out, that direction seems… unclear. Standing at nine tracks and 24 minutes, “Smithereens” functions more like an EP than a proper album. The first leg of the album features a collection of mellower cuts that lean into the dark, lo-fi balladry of the lead single, to often beautiful results. 
“Die For You,” which was teased before the album’s release, is another track that features a rock-solid, almost classic-feeling melody. Although the song carries the usual modern, DIY aesthetics of a Joji track, there’s a slickness to the songwriting that feels straight out of the ‘70s soul playbook. “Before The Day is Over” carries over similar characteristics, with some immaculate vocal layering on the choruses that gives the track a vivid, panoramic feel. “Dissolve” pairs a shimmering 12-string drone with an elegantly autotuned vocal line from Joji. The track feels like “Lens”-era Frank Ocean clashing with the early-’90s sounds of Ride or the Drop Nineteens, and Joji pulls off this combination of influences with his signature sense of longing and melancholy. The opening leg of “Smithereens” constitutes some of Joji’s best work to date, and would have made for a kick-ass standalone EP. However, it’s on the back end of the record where some familiar issues begin to pop up. 
The final four tracks of this record feels like a B-side collection tacked onto the album to fill out the tracklist, and totally derail the immersive vibe that “Smithereens” had going. These tracks aren’t bad; most of them (especially “YUKON (INTERLUDE)”) bring a distinct and occasionally off-kilter sound. However, they’re so scant and low-impact that it’s hard to even consider them full songs. 
The final leg of this record is criminally under-baked, and I think that “Smithereens” suffers mightily as a result. The album feels like it could have used another few months to fully flesh out the more low-impact moments on the back end, but the current form of the record just doesn’t know what it wants to be. It’s too breezy and short to be a full album, but doesn’t have the artistic focus to be an EP. And while it comes packed full of highlights (as Joji albums tend to do), “Smithereens” is still far from the defining statement many had hoped for Joji.

Halloween cannot be special without the stories of witches and other supernatural beings. In celebration of this holiday, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences invited their audience to a webinar on Oct. 31 to hear about the origins and development of witches and witchcraft. Panelists included  Deborah Harkness, a history professor at Dornsife, and Lisa Bitel, the Dean’s Professor of Religion and professor of religion and history at Dornsife. Peter Mancall, a Dornsife historian and the Andrew W. Mellon professor of the humanities, was the event’s moderator.
Dornsife Dean Amber Miller gave a brief introduction to the event and talked about how her top costume choice for Halloween was the witch costume. 
“I had to admit that for at least half of elementary school, I wore different versions of the same [costume] — I was always a witch,” she said. “Turns out I wasn’t exactly choosing the most unique costume. I just learned that witches are by far the most popular Halloween costume out there.”
The question of current day society’s fascination with witches opened the discussion among panelists. Harkness said that across many cultures, witches are often regarded as liminal figures or a threshold garter between life and death, healing and sickness, the hearth and the outdoors and between birth and creation. 
“I just think that thresholds indicate a change of status, and we’re all fascinated by change, so having a figure who embodies change in your community or who can help manage change, I think, that’s still appealing to us frankly today,” Harkness said. “Who wouldn’t like somebody to help us get through the next bump in the road?”
Originally, witches were not portrayed in the manner they are today. Harkness said the precursors of witches are often oracles, healers and people who knew scrying and other special skills. However, when it came to the late Middle Ages, the publication of a Germanic guidebook on witchcraft codified and stigmatized witches, causing widespread influence which continues to affect how people view witches today.
Although men were also accused of witchcraft in history, people often tend to associate magic with women. According to Bitel, a number of threads from different origins feed into a powerful ideology that led to witch hunts and the execution of tens of thousands of women.
“If you think about gender theory in the medieval period, based on Aristotle, women were weaker, weaker of body and thus weaker of mind,” Bitel said. “And, in a Christian sense, weaker in that they were more prone to sin, especially lust, which made them more open to Satan.” 
The panelists also discussed how the concepts of witchcraft connect to contemporary society. Bitel said it is interesting to see the continuing cultural interest in magic — the rise of spiritualism, the revival of witchcraft and the creation of neo-pagan groups — and how all these ideas co-evolve with technology.
Harkness talked about how people’s belief in witches persist even to this day, long after the witch trials were halted. 
“Witchcraft and anxiety go hand in hand. I think we can look at our own time and modern versions of evil witches or others, and know that profound societal and cultural anxiety leads to wild accusations against people who used to be your very nice next-door neighbor and it’s now the other,” she said.
Witchcraft terms have also been used in modern-day languages. Harkness indicated that some conspiracy theories tend to use magical terms, such as cabal, to describe people who are responsible for the bad things that happen to others. Bitel added that there’s a long tradition for this phenomenon.
“People always look back to previous constructs for their accusations, so, you know, accusing women and others of incest or cannibalism or that kind of stuff,” Bitel said. “There’s a long, long tradition of those very accusations against people who are feared and distrusted.” 
Harkness said that this is unfortunately human nature and happens throughout history and today as well. 
“This is a pretty, pretty long tradition that led to a lot of death, so I would just encourage everybody to reflect on that,” Harkness said.

In September, USC received a $2.9 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to establish a program that trains students from underrepresented backgrounds for careers in regenerative medicine. Out of the 14 institutions that received CIRM grants, USC was the only private university. 
The multidisciplinary program — USC COMPASS: Creating Opportunities through Mentorship and Partnership Across Stem Cell Science — will bring together professors and resources from the Viterbi School of Engineering, the Keck School of Medicine and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“It’s a catch-all. It’s not just a program for students who are pre-med and want to go to medical school or even know that they want to go to graduate school,” said Senta Georgia, COMPASS director and assistant professor of pediatrics and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at the Keck School of Medicine. “It is a program that will give students the opportunity to do research with the labs that are affiliated with our program, and get in-depth training to the breadth of careers and opportunities within regenerative medicine so that we can start to kind of tip this balance of the scales and see more of these underrepresented people in the in the industry.”
The two-year program will welcome its initial cohort of 10 rising juniors this summer. Scholars will receive an $8,000 stipend for their summer research, a $1,000 monthly stipend throughout the school year and a $10,000 tuition credit. 
The COMPASS application will go live by Jan. 15, 2023, on www.compass.usc.edu. The leadership team is currently finalizing the program’s website, which will explain the process for submitting applications and detail the components of the program: coursework, laboratory research, mentorship, community outreach opportunities and a capstone project.
“We are particularly interested in recruiting students that wouldn’t necessarily think to be involved in this kind of a program,” said Francesca Mariani, COMPASS co-director and associate professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at the Keck School of Medicine. “We’ll be reaching out to the many centers at USC that support its students, ranging from students with disability, LGBTQ+ students and students from racial groups that are typically underrepresented in science.”
Scholars will pursue 12 units of required coursework and electives. Additionally, a proposed minor in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine is under review by the curriculum office. Scholars will complete most of the credits for the proposed minor through their required coursework, but all USC undergraduates will be able to declare the minor should it be approved.
The program provides multiple levels of mentorship in terms of career preparation and exposes students to various facets of the discipline. Scholars have access to a council of mentors from underrepresented backgrounds and external mentors from different facets of government, industry and academia. Under the guidance of a research advisor and mentor, scholars will have access to over 60 labs across University Park Campus, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Health Sciences Campus.
“We have people from all of the different departments working on aging, metabolism, cancer, stem cells, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, muscle regeneration, heart regeneration, intestinal regeneration, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, craniofacial biology, etc.,” Georgia said. “If you are interested in it, we have a mentor and we have a lab that is also interested in it.” 
Taylor Collins, a senior majoring in global health, serves as the first author at the USC Stem Cell Georgia Lab. Collins began her research with Georgia on the correlation between diabetes and coronavirus in the lab as a part of USC’s Bridging the Gaps — a summer research program for underrepresented students within medicine and the biological sciences. Collins said she wishes she could have joined COMPASS and recognizes the unique advantage it provides undergraduate students interested in research as a two-year program.
“A lot of the research opportunities are over their first summer and then that’s it, there’s no more connection,” Collins said. “Whenever you’re only working for a month, you’re just assisting but whenever you’re on one project for two years, you can actually be considered for publication. It shows that not only did you do the work, but you were really instrumental in putting together the project as a whole.”
Collins said it is important to increase minority representation in medical research because many research projects are based on “majority white or male populations,” preventing the results from being truly representative.
Mariani said stem cell biologists from around the world will lead seminars at USC presenting their cutting-edge research.
Participation in the COMPASS program can serve as a segue to enrolling in the Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine Master of Science program as a progressive degree student.
“We can help advise students regarding post-graduate programs if they are interested,” Mariani said. “Students may even be able to use their tuition remission for some of our master’s program courses.”

With midterm elections a single day away, many USC students — from those registered to vote in Los Angeles County to those hailing from out of state — hoping to perform their civic duty, may have questions about their voting eligibility. To encourage civic engagement in the greater campus community, the Daily Trojan has compiled helpful tips and commentary to ensure a smooth voting plan on the big election day.
Where can students vote in-person or drop off their vote-by-mail ballot near campus? 
There are two stand-alone ballot drop boxes in the greater campus area — one in the USC Village beside the Hoover Street gate and another up north at the Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. Both of the drop boxes are in the Fryft zone and will close at 8 p.m. unless there is a line of voters.
For in-person voting, there are polls nearby at Masjid Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, the Ahmanson Senior Center, Vermont Avenue Elementary School, Hoover Recreation Center, Betty Hill Senior Citizen Center, Greater Bethel Cathedral and the Loyola Law School. You can also turn in your mail ballot at any of these locations before 8 p.m. on election night.
How can out-of-state voters cast their ballots for the Tuesday election?
For students planning to vote as absentees, rules will vary by each state on the timing of when your ballot must be cast — with many requiring voters to send in their ballots multiple weeks in advance of election night. Natasha Tieu, a junior majoring in history and economics and data science and president of VoteSC, said that her organization made a push for those students to request any ballots they needed from their states early on in the election season.
“If you are looking to vote outside your state, then you need to be really careful and read the legislation that surrounds that,” Tieu said. “One thing that we were really, really pushing was to get everyone to get their absentee ballots early, because for a lot of states, you have to get your absentee ballot in a month before the election.”
One of those absentee voters is Antonio Wu, a sophomore majoring in public policy voting from Wisconsin who mentioned being “a little nervous” about his ballot arriving home on time.
“The absentee voting was … a little inconvenient in that I definitely had to plan pretty far ahead,” Wu said. “There’s just an element of unpredictability when you mail it back whether or not it will get there in time.”
But for those out-of-state students hoping to register as a California voter, it’s not too late — at the polling center, you can fill out a provisional ballot, change your voter registration to your current USC address, and, after your information has been confirmed, your vote can still be counted.
What if I want to vote, but I missed the voter registration deadline?
In California, you can still submit same-day, conditional voter registration and cast your ballot at the polls on election day if you’ve missed the deadline — your ballot will be processed and vote counted as soon as your registration has been verified.
“It’s a great resource that we have in California that makes voting so much more accessible to so many people,” said Sara Stienecker, a sophomore majoring in political science and co-director of external affairs for VoteSC.
Why is it important to vote this Tuesday?
According to those at VoteSC like Stienecker or Tieu, or out-of-state voters like Wu, there are many advocacies and important information they believe make it essential to vote this Tuesday.
“If you’re on the fence about something and you’re not quite sure about a specific issue on the ballot, you can leave those things blank … you can vote for how much or however little you want,” Tieu said. 
“I think it’s really important to utilize the vote that so many people fought so hard for … it’s just our way to participate in this system and this democracy,” Stienecker said.
“While it may be unfair that it is a little harder for college students to vote, and it may be unfair that our voices are not as well-represented, I would say to make [voting] plans every time there is an election, do thorough research on candidates and at least put your name into the process … . It’s not always the most enthusiastic thing for us to do, but it is a privilege,” Wu said.

Like many people my age, my screen time every day is abysmally high. I spend too much of my free time on my phone and on social media — especially Twitter. With over half a million followers, an account I see regularly in my feed is SheRatesDogs, a popular anonymous submissions-based page. The title of the page is a play on the more popular page WeRateDogs, another submissions-based account instead devoted to positively uplifting canines of the world, in the format of a photo, short blurb and rating of 11/10 at the least. However, the SheRatesDogs page is an entirely different online community. 
All men are dogs — some are good and some are bad. Or at least that’s what my mom always liked to tell me when I would complain about jerks at school or my dating woes. SheRatesDogs seems to subscribe to a similar philosophy, using the platform to criticize the ridiculous and awful words of the “bad dogs” in the world. As stated in the account’s bio, “the dogs are your exes/someone’s exes.” The page is a public record of the normalized verbal harassment women face from men online — whether it be from former partners, potential connections or complete strangers. 
Many posts feature men becoming hostile after facing rejection or not getting a response. Instead of taking no for an answer, they spew out hate and abuse to those who truly do not deserve it. 
Through commiseration and humor, SheRatesDogs exposes the violence of misogyny in heterosexual dating app and online culture. Emboldened behind a phone screen rather than face-to-face communication, the verbal assault heterosexual men are willing to inflict upon their potential romantic and sexual interests is beyond frightening. The only technique we have left to deal with it is to laugh at them as a coping mechanism. The entitlement many men feel over women and their bodies is so ridiculous that it’s hard not to laugh at them. But the language used is rather frightening. It’s vulgar, violent and most importantly, completely unwarranted and unprovoked. 
Beyond outright verbal abuse, many other instances reveal men who continue to pursue a past romantic interest despite treating them unfairly. In looking over these posts, how are these men so bold as to be caught cheating or lying, and still try to make a comeback from such a major betrayal without making proper amends? They somehow have the audacity to do this over text or Instagram DM too. 
The account as a whole is a deep dive into heterosexual male entitlement. They feel entitled to women, to kindness, to forgiveness, to love. Our patriarchal culture has created these monsters, these men who place so little value on the humanity and emotions of women that they feel as if they can say anything to them. 
The account’s popularity demonstrates that this is not just a small group of men — it is a widespread problem that far too many have unfortunately faced. Luckily, in the comments section, you can find a community of shared lamenters, validators, allies, friends and people who have experienced similar instances — or at least have the humanity to recognize that these messages are disgusting, unacceptable and utterly appalling. 
Gendered verbal online abuse has become largely normalized in recent years, and the online abuse is reflective of women’s reality. The cruel reality of the world is that one in six American women have survived either an attempted or completed rape, with 90% of American rape victims being women. SheRatesDogs simply exposes a symptom of the problem — the dehumanization of women so many men participate in without a second thought. 
But all is not lost. While men continue to perpetuate the heteronormative patriarchal side of society with their audacity, women will continue to combat it with our boundaries. No one deserves to be berated and belittled because a relationship didn’t work out, but it doesn’t stop people from doing so. Luckily, there will always be that block button and in more serious cases, remember that all dating apps have some form of a report function. Despite the hostility and vitriol, at the end of the day we still have the ability to laugh at these men’s audaciousness, because sometimes laughing is better than crying. But above all, while you might not have the power to stop men from being dogs, you have the power to walk away and starve them of the attention all dogs seem to crave. And if that doesn’t work, let SheRatesDogs do the work of calling them out.

Picture this: You come home after a day of hard work to an unfamiliar mess in the kitchen. But you for sure didn’t make that. Who did? BAM! You remember you don’t live alone — there are other pigs in the sty.
We’re far enough into the semester to know whether your roommates are tolerable or not. But unfortunately, it’s not close enough to where you have little time left with them. If you’re living with them for the entire school year, you still have seven months left. 
No matter how terrible or disgusting they’ve made your home, Dr. Blingspice is here to help you survive the worst situations. If they don’t clean, have too much loud sex or chew with their mouth open, don’t worry. Dr. Blingspice can teach you ways to fix your roommates’ behavior.
I keep hearing moaning noises coming from my suitemate’s room while I’m trying to do work. It’s disgusting and distracting. Should I confront them about their sexual tendencies, or should I keep quiet?
Put something so unflattering and loud on the television that the roommate gets turned off and all sexual tension dissipates. If there’s one thing you can do, it is kill a vibe.
Your home should not be a brothel. While I’m an advocate for sexual liberation and expressing your urges, do your business in a place where no one can hear. There is no reason anyone should be immersed in a sexual experience they’re not a part of. If they’re grown enough to be engaging in these behaviors, they’re grown enough to know better.
If it bothers you enough, bang on the door and ruin their night the same way they are ruining yours. Imagine having coding homework due the next day and you’re subjected to your roommate’s animalistic behavior. 
Alternatively, slip an abstinence pamphlet under their door. There is no better way to correct behavior than embarrassment.
My roommate smacks and chews food with their mouth open. I’ve mentioned it before, but going into the fourth month, it’s really bothering me and grossing me out. I don’t want to be that person and come across as rude, but I can’t live with it anymore! What should I do?
The animalistic tendencies don’t stop. They are rampant across USC! These are not Trojans. They are Travelers. Call animal control.
No one should be able to see what you are eating. Imagine glancing over at your roommate and you spot their chewed-up food in their mouth. NO!
Tell them cordially to chew with their mouth closed and reiterate that you’re keeping their best interest in mind. It’s universally distasteful, and no one should be subjected to that. 
If they tell you they can’t chew with their mouth closed, tell them to start eating in their room or away from you. You should not be going crazy in the comfort of your own home.
My roommates refuse to clean or contribute in the apartment. They leave every mess they possibly can in the kitchen and won’t wipe a counter or sweep the floor. How do I tell them to clean up after themselves?
This trumps all of the roommate issues possible. Someone who does not clean up after themselves does not care about your physical or mental health.
You come back to what’s hopefully a clean home and find crumbs all over the counter and maybe even moldy food out. I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.
Begin by arranging a house meeting to set cleaning standards; you can eliminate the need to call them dirty. However, if you feel the situation is too far gone to set up a meeting, you should confront them and remind them to clean up after themselves until they begin doing it.
If they never begin cleaning, it’s time for war. Put their dirty dishes in front of their door. Send blunt messages telling them to wipe down the counters. Eventually, your message will be clear and they’ll learn, even if it comes at the cost of a relationship with your roommate.
At the end of the day, your roommates aren’t meant to be your friends. They are just there to share a space and make the rent cheaper. Capitalism put you together, not friendship.

In the span of two weeks, both Hawai’i and Mexico felt the aftermath of an encroaching environmental disaster hit their shores.
On Oct. 26, a state-owned PEMEX oil platform reportedly leaked off-shore and polluted beaches in Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. While the extent and amount of oil is not confirmed, wildlife covered in the substance were found in areas 42-65 miles away, according to the Save the Waves Coalition. 
Farther out to sea, the North Shore Coastal Resilience Working Group released a report highlighting critical concerns related to coastline erosion and community vulnerability on O’ahu. Among the concerns were the increase of risk due to climate change and sea level rise, along with “damaged and public beach access due to erosion, beach loss and inappropriate response measures.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
On the North Shore, about 28% of residential properties are built 20 feet or less from the shoreline. The gravity of the erosion has the NSCRWG calling for a statewide “managed retreat,” as hot spots were identified at the classic surf spots of Rocky Point, Turtle Beach and Chuns. 
The increase in residential construction and the properties’ close proximity to the water jeopardizes the working groups’ ability to implement mitigation measures, Lauren Blickly, a spokesperson for the O’ahu Surfride Foundation, told Hawaii News Now.
“While coastal erosion is a natural process, it has been accelerated by climate change and sea level rise and unfortunately private homes and public infrastructure have been built too close to the shoreline and the water’s edge and directly atop the natural dunes from which the shoreline would naturally replenish itself,” Blickley said.
In Salina Cruz, the immediate effect of the oil spill has been felt across communities and beaches. The initial spill reached beaches including Playa Brasil, Playa Azul and Playa Guelaguichi, along with the Salinas del Marqués wetland. The locations compose part of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, an ecosystem that provides life for endemic and vulnerable species of animals, but also is a main source of livelihood for local fisherman and surf tourism centers. 
The clean-up process is projected to last at most six months, but in the interim, fishing has been suspended. PEMEX has pledged to hire local residents for the clean-up.
To prevent another situation like this happening, the Save the Waves Coalition has developed a campaign to designate the area as a legally protected ecosystem. The plan also intends to halt the proposed construction plan of an industrial port next to the Salina Cruz wave.
“A conservation project in Punta Conjeo will prevent further threats to the wave, biodiversity, habitat, and the local livelihoods and will contribute to conserving this unique and important ecosystem,” Save the Wave Coalition’s surf protected area network manager Mara Arroyo said.
It sometimes feels a little exasperating to relay the gravity of environmental harm in a way such as, “Your favorite wave to surf is going to be ruined.” But unfortunately, when individual psychological barriers exist to confront the reality of climate change, there aren’t many options to turn to.
For example, psychologist and economist Espen Stoknes has attempted to grapple with why (some) humans have avoided dealing with threats to the environment. I qualify the question because it has been confirmed over and over that it isn’t the entire human population that is resistant.
“We need to be clear that this is a cultural phenomenon,” Stoknes said in an interview with Yale E360. “Because in countries like Thailand and the Philippines, or in Latin America and countries in Southern Europe, the concern about climate change is very high. So it is an issue that particularly pertains to people in wealthy democracies.”
Stoknes identifies five psychological barriers that are triggered by climate science communication: distance, which highlights the disparities that help wealthier countries avoid immediate impacts of climate change; doom, a catastrophic framing by the media; dissonance, knowing that our individual impacts do contribute; denial, ignoring unsettling facts; and identity, where we look for information that is self-confirming to our own values — and ignore the challenges. 
While any of these barriers is a column in and of themselves, identity has a specific place in a surfing column. 
When surfers have the time or the resources to travel the world on flight after flight to waves, including in the most acutely climate-vulnerable locations, it feels like an extension of dominion, or control. This is not to say that some surf tourism does sustain local communities, but the exchange between the surfer and that particular spot is usually one-sided; it is a chance for the surfer to get a ride of a lifetime, but it ends at that.
Many environmentalists, and Stoknes himself, have called for a reframing of the relationship between an individual and the environment to one of stewardship rather than dominion. It can start with small steps, such as a donation to local environmental or Native groups to each surf spot visited, or participation in the activism that these groups spark in order to facilitate often lengthy battles with state or federal governments to combat the effects of climate change. 
So while it can be somewhat uncomfortable to frame environmental destruction in a way that emphasizes harm to surfing, sometimes you have to work with what can work.

With three seconds left on the clock, down two points and the season on the line, Drew Peterson heaved a shot from just inside the half court line to try and win the game against Miami in the round of 64. But his effort was astray, as his shot hit off the backboard and clanked off the front of the rim, ending one of USC’s most successful regular seasons ever with a heartbreaking close. 
It has been 232 days and counting since that shot, and the Trojans are hoping to make it right back where they left off. The Trojans are coming off a season in which they reached the top five in the AP poll for the first time in almost 50 years. Their 26 wins in the regular season tied a school record for the most regular season wins in USC men’s basketball history. Their 14 conference wins are also near the top of the history books, tied for the second most in Trojan history.
With youth all around for the team this year, USC will look different than they have in years past. Many of last year’s key players left the program — eight in total — so the Trojans will have to rely on their few upperclassmen to lead them to continued success.
“We’ve got guys that haven’t played as many minutes kind of stepping up for a bigger role this year, so I’m trying to help them in any way I can,” said Peterson, now a fifth-year senior, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Guys like me and Boogie and guys who have played a lot before really need to help with our experience and help teach [the underclassmen] and show them the way so we can limit those growing pains as much as we can.”
Peterson, one of only three players left over from the elite eight team from two years ago, and senior point guard Boogie Ellis were named team captains for the season, along with sophomore guard Kobe Johnson. Ellis and Peterson make up two of the four total upperclassmen on the team this year, as the Trojans will be dominated by youth. Head Coach Andy Enfield, the 4th winningest head coach in USC men’s basketball history, knows this team is different from those in years past, but is anticipating a good balance of play style this season.
“We’ve had a lot of big guys lead us in scoring the last five or six years, but we’ve also had a lot of great guards. So now we have a pretty good mix, and I think our guards will lead us in scoring this year, so it will be a little different this year,” said Enfield. “We know we have a long season ahead and we have to get better as a team, take it game by game so we’re looking to the future,… [but] it’s pretty exciting for the new group to kind of make their own identity.”
USC begins the season with a slate of mid-major teams before participating in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament during the week of Thanksgiving. The Trojans could compete against many Power Five conference schools in the tournament, such as Tennessee, Butler, Wisconsin, Kansas and NC State. After Battle 4 Atlantis, USC gets a taste of Pac-12 conference play as they face Washington and Oregon State before the new year begins.
As in recent years, the Pac-12 conference is very strong this season, boasting three teams — UCLA, Arizona and Oregon — in the top 25. Members of the Pac-12 media projected all three teams to finish above USC in the final Pac-12 standings. This is nothing new for the Trojans, as in the past three years, media members have projected USC to finish third, sixth and fifth, respectively, in the preseason standings. USC has surpassed the preseason projections in those three years, except last year when they met expectations and got third.
“You know, for me, everything’s been about opinion, so it’s proving people wrong, playing as hard as and as best as we can just playing together,” said sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters. “I think we’ll be a pretty good team, and our goal is always to be successful and make it to the tournament.”
USC kicks off its season this Monday at Galen Center against Florida Gulf Coast at 6:30 p.m.

On the final day of Pac-12 regular season play, USC women’s soccer spoiled UCLA’s hopes of winning the conference title with a hard-fought 2-0 victory.
Two first half goals from set pieces made the difference for the Trojans, whose strong defensive performance sealed the win.
UCLA entered the match as the No. 1 team in the nation on the Coaches Poll, with an in-conference record of 9-1-0. USC sat at No. 14, with a 7-1-2 conference record. Both Stanford and UCLA had a 4-point advantage over USC in the Pac-12 table prior to the game, so USC was incapable of winning the conference title, but felt motivated to ensure UCLA did not celebrate on the Trojans’ home turf, Head Coach Jane Alukonis said. 
“I still wish we were competing for the Pac[-12], but… we said there was no way we were going to let them celebrate on our field,” she said. 
UCLA started the match with intensity, registering the game’s first shot on goal in the 4th minute. The Bruins’ best spell of possession came in the opening 10 minutes, hitting a flurry of shots at graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith’s net before the Trojans had an opportunity to string together a real attack.
After the 10th minute, though, the Bruins didn’t have much success in USC’s half. The Trojans consolidated possession and were able to consistently pressure the Bruins. USC won their first corner kick in the 14th minute, which sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio delivered into a dangerous area with her usual aplomb. The ball bounced around in the middle of the box until redshirt senior defender Kaylin Martin got a foot to it, striking the back of the net. The goal was Martin’s first of the season.
UCLA tried to up their tempo and intensity after falling behind, but the goal appeared to instill USC with even more confidence, creating more quality shots. Senior forward Hannah White had a shot with her right foot, closely followed by sophomore forward Simone Jackson’s first shot of goal of the match.
The Trojans were using the wings effectively during their build-up play, particularly on the right side. Senior defender Nicole Payne displayed strong chemistry with the midfield and sophomore forward Kayla Colbert, helping to advance the ball upfield with efficiency. 
Just before the 30-minute mark, the ball deflected off UCLA midfielder MacKenzee Vance’s arm inside the box. The referee whistled for a penalty, which junior defender Zoe Burns took. She strode forward to shoot and placed the ball in the top left corner. 
“I love PKs,” Burns said post-match. “PKs are my bread and butter, they always have been. I love them, so it’s not a big deal… as the kicker you should make it, so honestly it’s not as much pressure as you think it is.”
USC led by two goals going into the half, having outshot UCLA eight to seven.
UCLA chased the game in the final 45 minutes to no avail. Again, the Bruins tried to up the intensity from kickoff, attempting to unnerve the Trojans with their physicality, but the Trojans’ composure didn’t waver. 
USC almost took a 3 goal lead when the ball deflected off UCLA goalkeeper Lauren Brzykcy’s chest from a corner kick scuffle, which sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall followed up, striking the ball right back into Brzykcy’s grasp from close range.
Mid-way through the second half, UCLA switched from a back four system to a back three, pushing an extra player into midfield to secure possession and create opportunities. USC responded to the change by sitting slightly deeper and bringing White into the midfield, leaving Jackson as the lone forward. 
UCLA largely dominated possession for the remainder of the match, but struggled to convert that time on the ball into quality chances. Burns, Sampaio and sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer scuttled around the midfield, harrying UCLA’s midfielders and leading them into poor decisions. Every so often, a USC player would win the ball and immediately break forward, trying to find Jackson with a through ball. Jackson continued to worry the Bruins’ defenders, posting four shots in the second half.
Even as UCLA pushed forward desperately for a goal, Courtnall, Martin and the rest of USC’s defense allowed barely any penetration. UCLA’s final shot came in the 81st minute. Smith didn’t have to make a save after that moment. 
When the clock read 90:00, the final whistle blew and USC’s celebrations began. No matter the result of the Stanford vs. Cal game later in the day, UCLA had lost the Pac-12 title, denied by their rival’s elite defensive performance. UCLA’s leading scorer Sunshine Fontes was limited to just two shots. Prior to this match, USC had not defeated UCLA since 2015.
After the handshake, the Trojans emptied the Gatorade bucket down Alukonis’s back. 
“We wanted to come in and just go toe-to-toe, head-to-head,” Alukonis said after that match. “We knew whichever team kept [the ball] more was probably going to create more chances and dominate…[I’m] super proud of the group, because often UCLA can get into big shape. We won the ball back quickly whenever we lost it before they could get into that shape and dominate.”
Alukonis was impressed by the effort across the whole pitch. 
“They say soccer’s 11 one-versus-ones,” she said. “I think we won them.”
The win over UCLA will help the Trojans on Nov. 7, when the NCAA will announce the seedings for the Women’s College Cup. USC has beaten all four ranked opponents they have played.
When asked whether or not senior midfielder Croix Bethune would return for the postseason, Alukonis did not offer clarity, but said that sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo will play.
USC’s goal for the postseason? 
“Stay consistent and stay true to who we are,” Alukonis said.
USC will play their first round match on either Nov. 11, 12, or 13.

USC kept UC Berkeley at a distance long enough Saturday to earn a 41-35 victory on Homecoming weekend. But on a night that dipped low into the 50’s, at times the Trojans looked cold on all three sides of the ball.
“We didn’t play our best, really any of the sides,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley. “Didn’t have a very good half offensively, did not finish the game well defensively, made some big special teams plays but also gave up a few … so obviously a lot to improve on.”
Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams powered the offense to a touchdown in the first quarter, completing 6 of his 7 passing attempts before rushing for a 1-yard score. However, the Trojans punted on their other two first quarter drives and struggled to convert on third down, finishing 5-12 on third downs compared to their 54.74% third down conversion rate that ranks third in the nation. 
Williams again flashed his elite talent and athleticism, throwing for 360 yards and 4 touchdowns, often scrambling to extend plays and give his receivers time to get open.
Redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington and sophomore wide receiver Michael Jackson III both surpassed 100 receiving yards and scored a combined three touchdowns in the absence of sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams and junior wide receiver Jordan Addison, who both missed the game with injuries.
“[Washington and Jackson III] are two really competitive players, two guys that have made an impact not only on offense but on special teams,” Riley said. “Right at the beginning when we started them, they weren’t necessarily at the top of the depth chart or guys that were getting a lot of opportunities and they’ve hung in there and they’ve continued to work, continued to improve.”
While the offense had a slow start, the defense had a rough finish. A banged-up defensive unit missing sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry and senior linebacker Ralen Goforth allowed the Bears to score on four of their final five drives — erasing a double-digit lead USC had sustained from the end of the first half until the middle of the fourth quarter. 
“We’ve got to make sure that we’re putting the guys in the best situation to be successful,” said defensive coordinator Alex Grinch. “We can be excited about a win and pissed off [with] how we played.” 
The defense had an interception and 3 sacks, including two from junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu who now leads the nation in sacks this season. However, the unit also allowed senior quarterback Jack Plummer to throw for over 400 yards for only the second time in his career. 
“We know we just got to get back to work in practice and we’ll figure it out,” said redshirt senior defensive back Mekhi Blackmon on the Trojans’ spotty secondary.
As has been a problem all season, the Trojans allowed several big plays. A 58-yard pass to junior wide receiver Jeremiah Hunter set up an easy touchdown for the Bears. A wide-open redshirt freshman wide receiver Mavin Anderson took a 47-yard house call after being seemingly forgotten by the Trojan secondary. Missed tackles also continued to plague the Trojan secondary.
A recovered onside kick early in the fourth quarter put even more pressure on the Trojans, who were playing in a Coliseum filled with the ghosts of fans who had already left thinking USC had secured the victory.
The special teams unit also made a blunder on their first extra point attempt, with redshirt senior long snapper Jac Cassante delivering a high snap that was almost returned for what would have been a Cal two-point score.
“We had a tough snap, and Jac’s been money for us all year,” Riley said. “Those are going to happen and honestly our guys did a hell of a job getting them on the ground even after the lateral.” 
One takeaway from the Trojans’ win was the explosiveness of Jackson III. The receiver had 115 yards on just 5 catches, adding a 19-yard rush. Jackson opened up the second half with a 59-yard touchdown grab, catching a slant route and speeding by would-be tacklers on his way to the end zone.
While injuries continue to plague the Trojans, tonight they showed that, if anything, they are built to win football games. With three games remaining in the season, USC has a path to the Pac-12 Championship and perhaps, with a good bit of help, their first trip to the College Football Playoff. 
The Trojans will have a short week of practice ahead of their 6:30 p.m. matchup against Colorado on Friday.
