During Game 4 of the series between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns Sunday, you could feel the tide turning. 
After a horrid Game 1 loss, the Lakers, and most importantly forward Anthony Davis, found their rhythm. They bounced back with two victories against the Suns that highlighted their size and depth on all fronts. It seemed like the Lakers would close out the series in five games. 
You might wonder, after reading the headline of this column — what happened? Well, Anthony Davis and his laundry list of contusions and sprains and strains happened. 
With about 48 seconds left in the first half, Davis drove toward the basket for a layup and landed awkwardly. He immediately grabbed the inside of his lower leg, a sign that his groin had been strained. 
At that exact moment, my heart was pulled out of my chest, leaving me wondering if this season would be as successful as I imagined. 
Before I dive into what this means for the Lakers, I do need to acknowledge Davis’ play. 
At times, Davis is lethargic on the court, almost unwilling to even play basketball. Timid with the ball and forcing jumpers, he drives Lakers fans nuts and causes explosions in my group chat. Almost every time Davis has one of these games though, he responds in the next one with dominance.
It was Game 1 where Davis had one of those scary games — scoring only 13 points on 5/16 shooting. It was a disgusting display of basketball, but, like the great ones always do, he came back and dominated games two and three, dropping 34 in both. 
He was simply the difference in those two wins. 
This takes me back to that dreaded baseline drive for a layup in Game 4 when he pulled his groin. Davis was already hurting with a knee sprain and was listed as questionable going into Sunday’s game. He tested his knee in warm ups but was noticeably limping in the first half. He had just 6 points on 2/9 shooting before getting injured. 
As he didn’t return after halftime, the roaring sounds in Staples Center went away, with the Lakers’ chances for back-to-back titles gone with them. The scrappy Suns took control of the game, and possibly the series too, running all over a depleted Lakers team hoping to catch a break.
With a Game 5 loss to the Suns, the Lakers season is all but done. They were simply destroyed on the court, and outside of LeBron, played as bad as possible. Even if they win Game 6, going back to Phoenix for Game 7 is not an ideal situation. The Lakers are capable of winning it, but it’s easier said than done. 
The Suns simply deserve it more than the Lakers. They’ve been healthy all year and have a talented squad full of players looking to prove themselves. It’s a matchup nightmare for any team, but especially one without a player as good as Anthony Davis. 
They were even in just a bit of trouble when he was healthy, now, though, it’s a California-sized problem. 
It’s no secret that the Lakers need Davis to win another championship, but any team with LeBron James should have a chance, right? 
If this was LeBron at age 34 and not 36, this column wouldn’t exist. The King would be able to carry them. But, he’s coming off a high ankle sprain that kept him out of half the season and an offseason that reached only 71 days — about half the time of USC’s spring semester.
You can never bet against LeBron, but if there was a time to do it, it’s now. We don’t know if James can put together a masterful performance to carry the Lakers into the next round. And it won’t just take LeBron, but a team effort with players like Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma and Andre Drummond. 
They have to step up, but will they? 
The problem though is that this group has been as inconsistent as Los Angeles weather. One day they’re blistering hot, the next they’re frustratingly cold. And in the NBA, you can’t afford to have your role players play cooler than cool. 
It puts the Lakers in a horrible position. 
They might have enough to pull out a victory against the Suns, but in the ensuing rounds, it’ll be ugly.
In a season full of injuries that have derailed this talented team, we might never know the full potential of this squad. By the next time I write this column, the Lakers’ season might be long gone, but for now, they live to fight another day, even if they’re without their most talented soldier.

This interview was edited for length and clarity.
After an 11-12 season for USC women’s basketball, Athletic Director Mike Bohn went back to the drawing board and pulled out a masterpiece — the hiring of Cleveland Cavaliers assistant coach Lindsay Gottlieb, a basketball lifer with experience at the collegiate and professional level and a huge get for the Trojans. 
In her first coaching job, Gottlieb led UC Santa Barbara to NCAA and WNIT tournaments before heading to UC Berkeley. She spent eight years at Cal, leading a not well-known women’s basketball program to the Final Four in 2013 and that advanced to the NCAA tournament seven out of eight times. Gottlieb became the first female head coach from a Power 5 conference to make the jump to the NBA following her hire as the Cleveland Cavaliers’ assistant coach in 2019.
Now, she’s ready for the challenge of making USC return to relevancy in the college basketball world. With her hiring made official early last month, the Daily Trojan sat down with Gottlieb to get an idea of her plans for the team. 
Daily Trojan: I know you’ve talked about it a little bit during your [introductory] press conference, but what was ultimately the reason that you decided to take this job?
Lindsay Gottlieb: I think the best way to describe it is that I felt it was an opportunity that was so special and wasn’t gonna be replicated in the next several years. I was really happy doing what I was doing — I had no intention of leaving the NBA this quickly. But when the USC job opened, and, more specifically, when [Athletic Director] Mike Bohn and his staff elaborated on how they wanted to commit to the program and where they saw [it] going, it was the combination of the University, the potential for women’s basketball and the way that this administration is committing to it. I was just like, ‘This is the opportunity of a lifetime.’
DT: Now, this team, you got a lot of young talent, a lot of potential available. How are you feeling about the team at hand — any players that stand out so far?
LG: Everyone’s home … after finals. So I’ve been Zooming with them and texting with them, but they’ll come back on campus for summer access in June. So, I’m really looking forward to getting with the team. Obviously, I’m very aware of the incoming freshmen with two All-Americans with Rayah [Marshall] and Clarice [Uche Akunwafo], and those are players that are young enough that I saw them in the recruiting cycle before I left for the NBA. I’ve watched the team from afar, just being a basketball fan. And, I mean, Alissa [Pili] is a special, special talent. But I just think there’s a lot of depth in there, there are a lot of pieces. And I think it’s good for them, it’s kind of a blank slate as well to have the opportunity to come in and, as a group, reinvent ourselves a little bit, because I think this group knows they haven’t gotten yet where they want to go. And, so, I’m looking forward to working with all of them individually and collectively to set our goals and then try and reach them.
DT: I’m sure you’re aware, like you said, you’ve been following the team, you obviously coached in the Pac-12 before. The conference is really one of the best, if not the best, in women’s basketball. What do you think it’s going to take for this squad to excel now that the conference is stacked as it is?
LG: It’s a fantastic conference. And, so, I think what it will take for us to be great, is number one: to continue to recruit the best players, not only on the west coast but nationally. And then I think two: here’s the real thing, is to develop players. You have to create a culture, that culture of winning, and you also have to run good stuff and execute because you can’t take a night off. It’s not like any team has so much more talent than anyone else that you can just roll out the balls and expect to win. You have to be performing at a high level. And that’s a great challenge for me as a coach, and I think it’s a really great challenge for our players. Because if they want to be pros, which a lot of them do, to kind of challenge yourself at that level every night, where you have to execute and you have to be locked in it, it bodes well for them. Just in the whole experience that they’re going to get because the league is loaded. And we have to separate ourselves with it, with how we do things, not just by showing up with USC on our jersey.
DT: Just from your perspective … we talked about building a program, what do you think it’s been lacking in recent years?
LG: It’s hard to answer that. I don’t want to knock anything that’s been done without having been there. I think, at the end of the day, the biggest thing, without having had the success — the postseason success, the winning that we would want — I think it’s really kind of digging in on getting a group of talented players to figure out what impacts winning, and then getting all of us to commit to doing that on a consistent basis in a very difficult league. That’s what I would say, that’s the magic touch. It’s not me coming in saying ‘Oh, they didn’t do this, or they didn’t do that.’ It’s just, say we have to figure out as a group what impacts winning and just be willing to commit to that. 
DT: You kind of touched upon this, but I was gonna ask about it — recruiting. That’s something that this year’s class is outstanding. [The] 2020 class was a little out of the top 20 and it’s been kind of inconsistent. How do you plan on tackling that recruiting strategy?
LG: I think what we have to offer at USC will allow us to bring in some of the best players in the country and, more importantly, people who are the right fit for where we want to go … It’s an unbelievable campus, in the city that, right now, is the Mecca of basketball, and the Mecca of media, which is what I think players are drawn to. The academic pedigree is second to none … We have it all. And, so, why wouldn’t we try to talk to and recruit the best players and people in the countries? That’s what we intend to do. And then you also have to be intentional about fitting together classes, that make sense, right? So the best teams aren’t just piling on all the best players you can get. It’s about the right fit from a positional standpoint or from the way you build a team. That’s what I’m excited for too. You have to construct it a little bit like a [general manager] and make sure you have everything that you need on the roster to be successful.
DT: Being that you were an assistant with the Cavs … what do you think you can bring from that NBA level to this Trojan team?
LG: The first thing is, I think the people who have successfully navigated going from the pros to college or college to the pros, I think it takes a nuanced understanding of what fits where. You can have had both experiences, and some things don’t work at the other level. And I think that’s been really a huge part of my education in this, but I definitely think that the NBA is just a think tank of basketball. You spent a lot of time on X’s and O’s, so I think I’m going to bring some things relative to pace of play and offensive efficiency and how we want to generate points, what makes for a high-powered offense that I’ve just been studying for two years. That’s the first thing, then I would say also when you’re involved in a pro organization, it’s the highest level of training, it’s the highest level player development and nutrition and strength and conditioning. And, so, I’m going to try again with the resources at USC, try to say, “OK, what are things that hadn’t been done before at the college level that do translate?” Can we really utilize film and analytics and nutrition in our player development program in addition to the on-court skill work? There’s just ideas and things that I’m going to think a little bit outside the box from what I’ve learned with the Cavs, and I’m excited to integrate some things from the pros that really worked and also to utilize the fact that I understand where college is different and it is about relationships and building with people and it’s not as transactional. So I think that’s going to be a fun challenge for me to figure out what works and what doesn’t and kind of have the synergy I think in our program that kind of utilizes the best of both worlds.

The men’s basketball team ended the season with their highest finish ranking in the Coaches Poll as the No. 9 team in the country with their 25-8 record. 
The team is losing some key pieces next season, such as the lottery-projected pick, freshman Evan Mobley, his brother sophomore Isaiah Mobley — who still kept his eligibility open to returning — and graduate transfer Tahj Eaddy. However, the Trojans still have some important members including redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin and new junior transfer guard from Memphis Boogie Ellis. Overall, the Trojans may not have their full force like last season, but will still be able to compete against any tough competition they would face in the conference.
The Trojans, along with the Pac-12, caught the nation’s eye with their long runs in last season’s NCAA tournament, with USC and Oregon State making the Elite 8, along with cross-town rival UCLA getting to the Final Four. So, when the men’s team released their conference schedule last week, it is important to look at the upcoming marquee matchups for the season. 
No. 5: Oregon State
The Oregon State Beavers may have had one of the unexpected postseason runs out of all the teams in the NCAA last season. They entered the Pac-12 tournament with a 14-12 record, and knocked off UCLA, Oregon and Colorado in the process to win the Pac-12 title. Then, they went on to make the Elite 8 as a 12th seed, beating high-quality teams such as Oklahoma State and Loyola Chicago. 
The Beavers, extending their head coach Wayne Tinkle’s contract, are also adding the former Maryland center Chol Marial and former Minnesota guard Tre’ Williams to their already deep squad who has shown they are capable against top-tier opponents, beating USC last season in Corvallis, 58-56. 
No. 4: Arizona
Arizona has been a difficult team to go against, despite their one year self-imposed postseason ban, as they were able to beat the Trojans at the Galen Center last season 81-72. Going into next season, the Wildcats have already lost their star guard James Akingo. But, they look to replace his presence with Georgia transfer Justin Kier. Arizona will be fired up to play their best after missing out on postseason action, so USC will be in store for a close matchup with them. 
No. 3: Oregon
Even though the Trojans ousted the Ducks twice, both in the regular season at home and in the Sweet 16, the Trojans will face a tough matchup against them this regular season. The Ducks easily beat the dominant Iowa Hawkeyes team, led by Luka Garza, proving how this team is capable of giving other programs a challenge. Oregon is known for major transfer moves to strengthen their squad, making them a strong opponent for USC.
No. 2: Colorado
The Colorado Buffaloes were able to beat the Trojans, not only once, but three times last season (twice in the regular season and once in the Pac-12 tournament semifinals). Even though Colorado only got to the second round of the NCAA tournament and as they lose their star guard McKinley Wright IV — who ranked in the top 20 for points, assists, rebounds and steals in Colorado men’s basketball history — this will be a crucial matchup for USC to show that they have developed from last season by taking down an opponent who figured them out on multiple occasions. 
No. 1: UCLA
This was going to be the obvious selection, but the UCLA Bruins, who were able to make a run to the Final Four, will be the most important games this upcoming season in the conference. Keep in mind that the Bruins will keep most of their squad (except for possibly losing their key sophomore Johnny Juzang to the draft), so this team intends to keep up their momentum from last season with many early preseason reports putting them as either No. 1 or No. 2 ranks going into the 2021-22 season. Add on the fact that USC beat them twice last season, UCLA will be out for revenge.

Mocking Trump on Twitter, sailing across the Atlantic on a carbon neutral boat, heading a worldwide climate strike, speaking at the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit — Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has accomplished a lot by the age of 18. She’s undoubtedly the leader of a viral, youth-driven global climate movement. But, what tangible goals has she actually accomplished?
According to Thunberg, the world’s leaders are not doing nearly enough — the scientific evidence and urgency of the rapidly changing climate are negated by unproductive global conferences dominated by high-GDP countries, weakly enforced market-driven policies and reliance on technological advancement to reduce CO2 emissions and global temperature rise. Her plea to representatives at the Climate Action conference in New York went viral, and, for good reason — it was strongly worded, scientifically accurate and called upon the countries of the U.N. to take some accountability in their loose environmental legislation at both an international and domestic level.
Climate activists today, whether they have the global notoriety of Thunberg or simply a following of friends and family, are operating on a different scale than ever before. With the rise of social media and the growing interconnectivity of news and information networks, activists and their actions are constantly scrutinized by a global audience. From filing legal complaints to organizing marches and protests, it’s never been easier for activists to broadcast their actions to the world.
The power to reach hundreds of millions with a single Tweet or Instagram post comes with the consequence of extreme and, often unnecessary, criticism by conservative commentators and politicians, who oftentimes attack climate influencers themselves rather than their demands or actions. Thunberg particularly has been berated for her age, the eco-friendliness of her own lifestyle and the alarmist tone of her messaging, despite the scientific evidence to prove her claims. Just weeks ago, Thunberg made headlines when she hit back at a Chinese media outlet, which she claimed “fat-shamed” her by alluding she was too heavy for someone who claims to be vegetarian. 
Despite the many naysayers, socially prominent environmental activists promote a conversation that needs to be addressed, applying pressure to the public and private sector alike. By promoting their messages and goals through various platforms, this new generation of climate activists and their tech-savvy predecessors can generate a positive feedback loop of engagement and awareness about specific issues and the climate crisis as a whole. 
Thunberg — who currently has an Instagram following of over 11 million and a Twitter following nearing 5 million — regularly engages with fellow environmentalists via social media, sharing information and resharing content from youth activists around the globe. In fact, Fridays for Future, a global school strike for climate action movement, began when Thunberg started sitting outside of the Swedish Parliament on school days, ultimately going viral and inspiring kids around the world to emulate her actions.
Conversely, activism via social media has the potential to be incredibly performative. Online activism itself simply pales in comparison to an in-person speech, march or peaceful confrontation. That being said, while social media can be the catalyst for social and environmental change, the real action takes place away from the screen. As the old adage goes, actions speak louder than words, and concepts like posting for a cause sometimes cause more harm than good — such as the #BlackOutTuesday movement for Black Lives Matter, which overran the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag with black squares instead of posts with critical info about marches and organizations accepting donations.
Posting a fact-checked infographic, retweeting a well-written news article or sharing an informative TikTok can all be effective ways of spreading information. However, social media is an engagement tool — a mechanism for message spreading that is rapidly gaining traction in every realm of activism. While it spreads the message of climate activists like Thunberg, it’s also an efficient method of broadcasting her offscreen actions, words, and arguments. Hashtags and graphics are merely the building blocks for a more substantial movement, an incentive for social media users to understand the issue and begin thinking about how they can incite change. Activism may begin on social media these days, but the efficacy of any movement is based on action, and social media is just a means of creating momentum to a much greater end. 
While the impact of climate activism isn’t as straightforward as the quantitative follower counts and likes on social media, it has the ability to sway public opinion and create change on a global scale. Effective climate activism creates public awareness, which causes political pressure, forcing change through legislation and, hopefully, compliance. This new generation of activism is not only renowned for its digitally amplified vocalization but the intersectionality and inclusivity that come with accessible social media platforms. Thunberg and her counterparts understand the duality of environmentalism and social equity and justice, weaving a message that addresses both socioeconomic and environmental goals through a lens of global justice.
A school strike or aesthetic infographics may not single-handedly rouse the world’s nations to step it up at this year’s U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, but perhaps the same is to be said for me spending hours on each installment of this column. Activism, at its purest, is nothing more than a collection of individuals who have all been motivated to incite change in their own way, hoping to build increasing momentum. More often than not, we have good intentions, but it’s important to consider how we can most effectively translate our intentions into action — an example of what not to do is the viral video of celebrities singing a painfully awkward rendition of “Imagine” at the beginning of the pandemic. Were they hoping to inspire us? Incentivize us to stay inside? I really couldn’t tell you, and I don’t think they could either.
All this being said, there’s no one single correct approach to activism or advocacy for change. But, perhaps intentional and effective social media usage will be the secret ingredient we need to educate, inspire and unite individuals around the world to take action and advocate for change.

Life is trying to go back to normal and with the consistent distribution of the coronavirus vaccine, universities are ready to open their campuses for in person classes in the fall. 
During the spring semester, President Carol Folt announced the plan to return to campus for Fall 2021. In April, another announcement was made that would require students, faculty and staff to be vaccinated before being able to participate in on-campus activities. The requirement will not take effect until coronavirus vaccines receive full approval from FDA. The school is giving students the option of declination forms that would permit them not to receive the vaccine for legitimate reasons, such as medical or religious grounds. 
As incoming and returning students start to get excited that they will have an in-person college experience, there is some reluctance as students try to return to their normal, pre-pandemic ways.
Zoom classes have been a staple in the era of pandemic learning. This method of schooling has brought both advantages and disadvantages to student learning in the past year. Some students were grateful for Zoom because it allowed them to stay at home but still attend class. Others suffered from Zoom fatigue and found themselves incapable of real learning while also struggling mentally to find a silver lining around their same, everyday remote routines. 
But, now, students are going to have to adjust, again. 
With the increase of vaccinated students around the campus, the feeling of being outside and around more people can come with a sense of anxiety and change of routine.
The entire 2020-21 school year was spent with most students all over the country moving from their beds to their desks to attend classes and do their work. They spent the majority of their days inside their bedrooms or houses as they depended on their internet connection to hold up, hoping that it wouldn’t lag during their class. 
Those stresses will no longer exist soon but a new form of stress may arise. A lack of motivation was one of the biggest problems that students struggled with during the pandemic — feeling as though they reached burn out more quickly during Zoom University than they did in person. 
Students will have to take time to adjust back to what was once normal for them. It will be a challenging adjustment. For instance, logging onto Zoom last minute to attend class, now changes to having to go back to a regular routine of waking up early and making a commute to campus. 
Another adjustment for students will be reverting back to their social tendencies. Being in a pandemic for an entire year and not being able to see people can change how people are able to interact with each other, not only in a social setting but in a classroom setting. 
There will have to be some patience from professors as students revert back to their old practices. This can also be a learning experience for professors as they can return to their normal teaching styles in an actual classroom and not have to put their entire existence of teaching in the hands of a computer. This shift comes with a sense of readjustment as they will have to find their rhythm back in the classroom to keep the attention of students that grew accustomed to seeing them virtually. 
Universities returning to in-person teaching is a step that a lot of people have waited for. Students now feel like they can get their money’s worth since they will be on the campus physically. Still, these universities must understand that student readjustment will be a whole process of its own. 
Professors should be understanding that it takes time for students to find the motivation that they once had and that it might take even more time for them to feel comfortable being in the classroom again. 
There are tons of measures the University can take to help facilitate this adjustment. One method is to have socially distanced events in the first few weeks of school to allow students the chance to get to know their academic community. 
Ultimately, the goal should be to make students feel comfortable in an environment that has been foreign to them for quite some time. Students from around the world will be occupying the campus, and it is the perfect time for faculty and staff to show their eagerness for normalcy by welcoming students with excitement and grace. 
Teachers and faculty should strive to generally afford students time to find their academic rhythm and not expect them to be 100% during the first or second week of classes. 
The pandemic has forced everyone to transition, especially the students. Hopefully, this fall will promote better mental health for students as they navigate dealing with burnout and exhaustion in a better environment. 
It is now in the hands of University officials to make students their number one priority in the return to campus. Their responsibility exists not only on the side of health and safety but in their efforts to make the transition to in person a welcoming and gracious experience.

When Darby Saxbe came across the Faculty-Led Initiatives Program at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in Spring 2019, she saw it as an opportunity to create the USC Center for the Changing Family, an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students who study the correlations between family, relationships and health — both physical and mental. Founded shortly before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the center’s work as a research hub outputs studies and findings on the modern family, especially as family life became more prominent in light of the pandemic. 
With a background in studying family stress and health as a graduate student and having worked on a study for the UCLA Center for the Everyday Lives of Families, Saxbe, an associate professor of psychology, said she understood the impact family relationships have on well-being. And then later as a postdoctorate and early faculty member with children, Saxbe said she began to develop a deeper understanding of the pressures and challenges of the modern family. 
“I started to feel like I was experiencing all the things that I had studied in terms of being overwhelmed, having too many things to manage, struggling to kind of find time to spend with kids while also working full time; just developing an appreciation of how challenging … the demands of a modern family are,” Saxbe said. “There’s a ton of pressure on the individual parents … and that’s not necessarily the most natural or humane way to operate as a family.”
Out of more than 30 working groups that submitted white paper proposals to the Faculty-Led Initiatives Program — whom Saxbe said were essentially asked to assemble their groups around certain themes — Saxbe said the Center for the Changing Family was one of only two groups selected to receive a start-up grant. After a year into their grant funding, more than 60 faculty and graduate students across various USC disciplines participate at the center.
Saxbe said that, as a psychologist, she knew she wanted to create a group with interdisciplinary faculty who utilized different approaches to study stress and health within families. In accordance with Saxbe’s goal, the center comprises individuals across various disciplines, including sociologists, a neonatologist, an economist and various doctors.
“I think by bringing those different perspectives together — people that are working with different populations and are interested in different things — we have a lot that we can learn from each other,” Saxbe said.
Similar to her work at the lab for NeuroEndocrinology of Social Ties, also known as the NEST lab, Saxbe’s research at the center focuses on couples adapting and transitioning when expecting their first child, following them through their pregnancy to the first year of their postpartum period. 
“Family configurations look really different across different cultures in different countries,” Saxbe said. “We have this kind of ‘Leave It to Beaver’ United States ideal of the two parent traditional family, but that’s really not the typical family configuration across the world … I think it’s important to understand because we know that close relationships are really important for health and well-being … Thinking about how we can support connections and close relationships that are supportive of each other is an important policy goal.”
Dorian Traube, associate professor of social work and a member of the center, has worked with the center since its inception. 
“There are a lot of really amazing faculty and students doing work — both research and clinical work related to Family Development in our University — but we didn’t really have any kind of central place for all of us to collaborate,” Traube said. “So then we were missing opportunities to leverage people’s expertise. I thought it was just a fantastic idea.”
After spending the past five years as the director of the Parents as Teachers at USC Telehealth at the School of Social Work, Traube now focuses her research on the ways in which virtual home visitation supports families and issues related to child maltreatment during the coronavirus pandemic. With the Parents as Teachers program launching nationwide due to high demand from pandemic social distancing, Traube said she will continue to look into quickly upscaling the program to meet the growing needs of parents. 
With the onset of the pandemic and President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda involving parental leave and universal preschool access, Traube said she believes that this is an important time to have an intense focus on what families need to be successful.
“I think this is a critical time, especially in the United States, where we … have a President who is centering issues around family,” Traube said. “Very little has happened in the last 50 years to better support families. We are at a point where the government is starting to look at that, and I think our center can offer really important information in that decision-making process.”
With Traube as one of her mentors, Abigail Palmer Molina, a graduate student studying social work, received a grant from the center to conduct research on supporting parents of young children, focusing on how to address maternal depression and improving access to treatment and services for underserved families and communities. Palmer Molina said the research grant she received was pivotal for her research, which allowed her to build on her dissertation and develop skills such as managing her own research budget, hiring employees, developing a research design and disseminating her findings. 
“The center’s funding … was a pretty fast turnaround and really gave me the flexibility to think about doing research differently for the moment,” Palmer Molina said. “It definitely helped change my research and make it more tied to what’s going on immediately around me and how I can best serve families.”
Palmer Molina also said that being a part of the center and their programming has helped her stay up-to-date with some of the issues and policies on Biden’s agenda, while also working at the forefront of policy change that creates an impact outside the center.
“My goals are to complete the work … and definitely take advantage of whatever programming they provide,” Palmer Molina said. “I think one of the one of the gaps that I noticed early as a student at USC is the lack of a … central focus on families, even though we have so many high-impact family scholars.”
In the last year, the Center for the Changing Family has hosted various events, including a collaboration with the Center for Political Future about politics and policies surrounding caregiving issues. Other events have included diverse speakers, such as a policy spokesperson from a Washington D.C. think tank, an advocacy spokesperson from Paid Leave for the United States, author Elliot Haspel and Congressman Jimmy Gomez, to talk about care issues. While Saxbe said she was cognizant that some students and faculty had found it difficult to find time for another hour-long zoom meeting out of their day, the people that did attend these events were enthusiastic about going and creating a community across different departments at USC.
“I think that it would have been much harder to organize if we had depended on everybody being willing to show up in person,” Saxbe said. “In some ways, we’ve been able to be more ambitious because we’ve been remote.” 
Optimistic that the center will continue in-person this fall, Saxbe said she looks forward to finally sitting down with people who she had many Zoom interactions with and to continue connecting with researchers. She also said that she anticipates occasional Zoom events to collaborate with experts outside of the Los Angeles area.
“I hope that we can raise awareness about research on families and the importance of relationships for health and well-being,” Saxbe said. “I hope that we can … help contribute to forging some really significant collaborations and that we can help to position USC as a leader in some of the most cutting edge research on families that is being produced.”

Fourteen in-person ceremonies later, USC’s 2021 commencement was the first large in-person event held by the University since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, drawing almost 15,000 students and 30,000 guests to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in mid-May. Since then, University officials have utilized the outcome of commencement as a foundation for planning more in-person events for the Fall 2021 semester.
According to Associate Vice President of Cultural Relations and University Events Adam Rosen, almost 1,000 people contributed to executing in-person commencement, with 350 people staffing each of the 14 ceremonies. Individuals from various departments contributed, the main ones including Cultural Relations and University Events, USC Department of Public Safety and the Coliseum.
“I think we’ve all become more versatile … In the future, I think we’ll have a level of hybridity to [large events] and it’ll be a combination, or there’ll be things that are only done in person or only done virtually because of one reason or another,” Rosen said. “I think it makes us much stronger to have gone through this [pandemic].”
Rosen said he believes some events conventionally held in-person may transition to the online modality, taking into consideration the positive feedback received from virtual audiences at events this past year and the capacity limits that venues present.
“There are so many events that we identified where our audiences were far larger than they would have been had they been in person, whether that was about the capacity of the venue they were in or the ability to watch it from your couch in your pajamas,” Rosen said.
However, as USC prepares for the Fall 2021 semester, it is not clear what the coronavirus guidelines from Los Angeles County and the state will look like when the semester begins. For now, Rosen is using Gov. Gavin Newsom’s June 15 deadline to fully reopen its economy as a sort of litmus test for University guidelines for large gatherings.
“I personally feel like we’re going to be in some type of distancing and some level of masking and capacity limit for a while. I don’t know that June 15 is going to remove all of those, but California is doing great on keeping infection [rates] down and we keep dropping in tiers which is amazing,” Rosen said. “I’m hopeful that by the fall, those limits will be as minor as possible.”
Dan Stimmler, vice president for auxiliary services and chief operating officer of the Memorial Coliseum, has overseen the work business operations and auxiliaries have done with the USC Office of Environmental Health and Safety and USC Student Health. The different departments have come together to create a comprehensive team ready to act on the ever-changing status of coronavirus guidelines throughout the last year.
With infection rates decreasing and the number of people getting vaccinated increasing, Stimmler is hoping to see 100% occupancy for football games.
“Obviously, we’ll react to whatever status COVID is at, and we will adhere to the county and state guidelines that they lay out for us, but my personal thought is, if we continue to come out of COVID as strong as we are, then we should be able to host a full season of games with fans,” Stimmler said.
Although it is still unclear that the University will mandate mask-wearing, safety measures, such as serving meals in containers, social distancing and wearing face masks may be implemented to ensure spectators are safe at games.
Stimmler, who also works with operations at USC Housing, said their goal is for dorm rooms “to have double occupancy and as normal of an academic year and housing as we possibly can.”
“From an operational side, we have enhanced safety measures and cleaning operations that adhere to standards that have been developed over COVID,” Stimmler said.
Additionally, Student Affairs is developing programming for incoming sophomores who did not get to have the freshman experience in the hopes that the transition from being away from home for the first time and meeting new people can be facilitated by support from the University.
Miko Mariscal, a rising sophomore majoring in sociology, is excited for big in-person events, however, with slight apprehension.
“I’m excited for them, of course, because things are getting better, but I am still worried about harming the communities that surround USC and especially because everyone’s excited to party and get back to normal,” Mariscal said.
Even though Mariscal has been a college student for a full year, she has not had the opportunity to experience campus life and is looking forward to the simplicities of going to the library, exercising at the gym, taking a walk and anything else that gives her the chance to step away from her computer and get a change of scenery.
Mariscal said that being at home has made her feel stuck as a high school student, but that, after waiting an extra year to move in, she is more than ready to be immersed in the USC community.
“I kind of still feel like I’m in high school. Maybe it’s just a lot of the people that graduated during 2020 that feel this way because we never really had our college transition moment,” Mariscal said. “I’m excited for what USC can bring me with experiences and being immersed and being seen as a college student, things like having the North Face backpack and the bike.”
Ben Miller, an incoming junior majoring in chemistry, is looking forward to returning to campus and attending large events such as football games, as long as guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are followed. Miller said it’s the “small things” that he misses the most. 
“I love just walking around the campus,” Miller said. “It sucks just in between classes sitting in your bed and then logging on to the next class. It’s always more fun to see people skateboarding around when you’re going from class to class.”
Students are not the only ones anticipating the move-in day. Magnolia Ycasas, whose daughter Ina, a rising sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, is all for her daughter going to campus in the fall. Though she worries about large gatherings, Ycasas feels more comfortable with Ina going to them knowing she is vaccinated.
“As a parent, I’d like her to experience all those events, especially because [the students] missed out on so much,” Ycasas said.
After over a year of distanced working and learning, USC officials and students are eager not just for big events like tailgating, football games and parties but also for the return to daily campus life.
“I just think the general sentiment in enthusiasm is high,” Stimmler said. “Where it was so fun before when you meet new students in the first week of school, I think that will be amplified by 20. The first home football game, I think that’s going to be amplified by 20 too, because people are ready to get back to normal life and experience all those things for the first time again.”

Do you know what I miss? The television sitcoms of the late ‘90s and early 2000s. Back then, young Black actors and actresses were at the center of television and humanized the young Black experience. Popular shows like “Moesha,” “One on One” and “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” took audiences through a day in the life of a Black teen that wasn’t inherently negative. 
As of lately though, it seems like shows of that sort are few and far between. Whether new shows are geared closer to children like “Craig of The Creek” or for those who are in their late twenties like “High Fidelity,” it seems like the once-booming television genre starring young Black actors and actresses completely skips my age demographic. 
It’s not like there aren’t shows for my age range at all, however. There’s a massive catalog of series that feature high school and college-aged people, like “Riverdale” and “13 Reasons Why.” But in shows like these, it’s usually a mainly white cast with a couple of Black characters sprinkled in.Look at “Riverdale” specifically: the show does have a couple of Black characters like Toni Topaz (Vanessa Morgan), Peaches ‘N Cream (Bernadette Beck) and Chuck Clayton (Jordan Calloway). However, the way these characters are written is quite unattractive. In most cases, Topaz is a background character who is only recognized in scenes that deal with her girlfriend Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch), who is white. Clayton, on the other hand, is portrayed as sexually charged and unsympathetic.
Neither fair well in their characterizations of Black characters, even to the point where the cast has spoken out about it. In an interview with ELLE, Beck felt her character was there for diversity and to be the show’s antagonist.
“I was, for no reason, depicted in a very negative, unattractive light. And I’m not the first Black actress to show up on set, stand there, chew gum, and look sassy and mean,” Beck said. “I feel like I was just there to fulfill a diversity quota. It’s just to fulfill points.”
While a majority of shows happen to follow this casting archetype, there are shows that have diverse Black casts tailored to my age range. But, often, they only put Black characters in unnecessarily extreme situations. 
The Netflix show “All American” follows a young Black football player, Spencer James (Daniel Ezra), from Los Angeles but, in the process, displays gangs, murder and drugs. Another show on Netflix, “Dear White People,” takes viewers through the lives of Black college students but at the same time puts them through extreme racism-plagued events. 
While gang violence and racism may play a role in the everyday Black experience, it isn’t everyone’s experience and doesn’t need to be the sole story told on screen. At this rate, seeing a Black character in a show go to school, mentally and physically unscathed, would be refreshing. 
I’ve come to realize that the age of a show’s creator is a crucial reason why it appeals to certain age demographics. Why do Black high school and college-aged people love watching shows like “Atlanta” and “Insecure,” even if they aren’t the target age range? It’s because creators like Issa Rae and Donald Glover probably grew up watching “Kenan and Kel,” “The Parkers” and “Sister, Sister,” and know how to write for a young Black audience.
Creators like these took the torch of young Black television of the ‘90s and early 2000s and brought it to the present for millennials. But while I enjoy these shows about Black millennials navigating the worlds of dating, careers and having children, I’m just not there yet.
So now I must know, who will create the positive relatable content for the Black teens and early twenty-somethings of my generation? With diversity and inclusion on the rise in Hollywood, it would only make sense that this gap in programming would be filled. The era of the Black teen is not obsolete, and honestly, I can only watch “The Fresh Prince” and “Moesha” so many times.

K-pop boy group TOMORROW X TOGETHER returned May 31 for their fourth comeback with their second album, “The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE.” The five-member group, composed of members Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun and HueningKai, cemented their well-deserved status as “monster rookies,” emerging as one of the biggest and most promising fourth-generation K-pop groups since their debut in March 2019. This time, TXT surpassed 700,000 pre-orders for their album, the most of any fourth generation group.
Despite being one of the few K-pop boy groups that debuted with, and have maintained, a bright and youthful concept with their debut single “CROWN,” TXT stands out for their diverse discography, ranging from ballads and rhythm and blues to dance-pop and hip-hop with trap influences. “The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE” further proves the group’s versatility as they graze the rock genre.
TXT re-visits the ballad genre with the warming “Anti-Romantic.” Compared to the rest of the album, there is significantly less vocal processing, post-production effects and instrumentation. The chords and plucking of strings are like fairy dust, while the members beautifully harmonize, making for an enchanting and dreamy melody. There is even less instrumentation in the chorus, allowing their natural and tender vocals to shine. 
Fans particularly anticipated “Anti-Romantic” after TXT released previews of each song from the album on TikTok while displaying their mastery of TikTok transitions and trends. “Anti-Romantic” exceeded expectations, especially with the group’s debut performance of the song during their comeback show on Mnet May 31. With a more stripped-back performance than usual, the members flexed their stellar vocals.
TXT also performed the lead single, “0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You),” a personal favorite that features singer-songwriter Seori. Many artists contributed to the song, including fellow Big Hit Entertainment group BTS’ RM. TXT first dives into the rock sound in “0X1=LOVESONG.” The instrumentation is heavy and grandiose throughout, starting with a drum beat drop and a heavenly chorus of vocals. As the percussion continues thundering, the intensity increases to resemble a feel-good, empowering soundtrack of a coming-of-age teen movie.
The lyrics here also express sorrow and desperation; HueningKai sings, “I’m full of problems, love sick,” while Taehyun pleads, “Save me / Take my hand / Please use me like a drug.” The boys sing with a rasp, adding to the song’s angst, especially as Taehyun belts, “I know I love you.” Seori’s soft voice blends perfectly with Beomgyu and Yeonjun’s deep and soulful color. 
During the comeback show, TXT also debuted “No Rules,” a funky and refreshing dance-pop, perfect for the summer. Energetic and charismatic, the unique choreography shows what TXT does best: emphasizing synchronization and coordination. Yeonjun also raps here and there, but he has still yet to reveal the full extent of his rapping abilities.
The bass differentiates “No Rules” from the album’s other pop tracks: “Magic,” “Ice Cream” and “What if I had been that PUMA.” Despite all being dance-pop tracks, each exhibits a distinct signature sound. “Magic” displays a disco influence and takes after early 2000s pop songs. The groovy bop is also TXT’s first full-English song. The intro to “Ice Cream” mimics the sounds of an ice cream truck surrounded by a crowd of kids, reminiscent of childhood summer memories. The song is funky, and the members’ voices sound a bit muffled as if the song is being played through a radio. Though odd, this effect adds a unique color that makes “Ice Cream” stand out from the rest. The robotic tinge from the autotune in “What if I had been that PUMA” is also striking stylistically.
The last two songs, including “Dear Sputnik,” which HueningKai co-produced, lean more toward the album’s “chaos” concept. “Dear Sputnik” wastes no time in building up to the chorus, but then the pre-chorus surprisingly dips into a darker melody before the drums rebuild tension. The heavy drums and electric guitar riffs are electrifying. The punk-pop style was relatively unexplored in TXT’s previous music, but “Dear Sputnik” dips perfectly into it.
Co-produced by singer-songwriter and rapper Ashnikko, “Frost” ends the album on an Ashnikko-style bang. “Frost” fully embodies the ‘chaos’ concept and the synth-rock sound, like a villain theme song. HueningKai starts the song by sing-talking and laughing almost maniacally. The intense bass drives the song and adds to the delirious ambiance. The members played further into the rock sound by belting with a growl — borderline shouting — the lyrics. Soobin’s rasp was especially shocking, as his vocals are typically smooth and silky. “Frost” is a solid — and surprising — ending to this flawlessly executed album.
All in all, “The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE” is another successful album and comeback from the monster rookies. Living up to its name, the album intensifies with each song, as if documenting the journey to the end — to ultimate chaos. What is most impressive is the various vocal techniques that the boys used to fit the vibes of each song. Their delicate ballad singing and harmonizing, as well as their raspy belting, impressed all.
No one member lacks as a vocalist, dancer, rapper or visual. They also have become more involved in the creation of their music, as seen by this most recent comeback — at least one member is credited in five of the album’s eight songs, with HueningKai co-producing one. TXT never fails to disappoint with their range and willingness to experiment, proving once again with “The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE” that they make any music genre their own.

Theatre is magic. Simple as that. Nothing is more thrilling than enjoying art — whether that’s alone or with loved ones.
Chicano playwright, poet and USC associate professor of dramatic writing, Luis Alfaro remains dedicated to bringing authenticity to the world of theatre despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
A native of Pico Union, Los Angeles, Alfaro spent 10 years as a poet and 10 more as a performance artist before working as a playwright.
“In a chance encounter, I met this playwright, María Irene Fornés, a famous Cuban playwright,” Alfaro said. “Then Irene took me on and kind of became a mentor and I started writing plays.”
His career took him across America, Canada, Europe and Latin America. But for Alfaro, L.A. will always be home. 
“Being Mexican-American, having grown up in downtown L.A. is basically the essence of every single thing I do,” Alfaro said. “I write from a varied perspective of L.A. I write about what it means to be a person of color living in L.A., working in L.A.”
Heart and pride in his identity is at the forefront of Alfaro’s work — including in his upcoming immersive audio play, “March of Time — Time Warp.” 
“Chalk Lines,” a series of audio plays, is being released by Chalk Repertory Theatre. The plays focus on storytelling representative of and created by historically unexplored communities in L.A. 
The play follows a candid tour guide, played by actress Emily Kuroda, who ushers the listeners through more than 150 years of Los Angeles history. 
On June 19, the play can be enjoyed online at home or at the locations it documents, such as Union Station, Chinatown, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and more. The play is free and will be available for six months. 
The cast is stocked with talent from Kuroda to recent School of Dramatic Arts alumnus Tonatiuh Elizarraraz. 
Kuroda is a seasoned actor, having worked previously with Alfaro and having a fan favorite role on “Gilmore Girls.” During her youth, Kuroda recalls speaking very little, but everything changed when she began acting in high school. 
“Through grade school I probably just said a few words, and then in high school when I discovered drama, where you could read other people’s words without putting your own self on the line — I said this is a godsend,” Kuroda said. “I got to express my feelings, my fears, my joys, without having to expose myself under the guise of someone else’s words.”
Kuroda found her perfect match. Right at the start of her career, Kuroda worked with Alfaro. Even now, she adores working with his writing because it is focused not only on the narrative but also the emotional arc of the story.  
Alfaro jumped at the opportunity to write for “Chalk Lines,” thrilled to write a short play involving a lot of sound.
While the piece hops through generations, the modes of transportation change as well, allowing the audio team to expend their full talents. 
Sound team Justin Asher and Colin Wambsgans, relished the opportunity to play around with the project’s design. Wambsgans is known for his sound work at concerts, installations, podcasts, films, plays, apps and then some. Asher is a L.A. based composer, audio producer and sound designer. 
“[With] a lot of other plays, we really have to get focused and do a lot of fine tuning to have it sound like a very specific place,” Wambsgans said. “[Alfaro’s play] gives us a lot of room for more creativity on our end.”
Having worked together on numerous projects, Wambsgans and Asher perfected their process of crafting sound design experiences. 
“What is the sound supposed to convey in the end?” Asher said. “A lot of what [we] do with the sound is figure out how to make it sound like it’s in the place where it’s supposed to be.” 
While the play’s settings may elicit vivid sensory experiences from its listeners, the vision of the script permitted the sound team to explore the play’s atmosphere. 
“The world we’re supposed to create … is much more imaginary, it’s a much more sort of expressionistic world,” Asher noted. “It’s a fun challenge, but it leaves a lot up to the imagination, which is a lot of fun.” 
The sound in the audioplay transports listeners from the Chinese Massacre of 1871 to organizing in the 1900s to the rapid demographic changing of neighborhoods like East L.A. Boyle Heights. 
“Initially it was supposed to be a walking tour for people [to] follow the sites that were being talked about. But then what happened because of the pandemic is we had to switch to making an audio tour,” Alfaro said. “So I’m hoping that people still go on the journey … but what I love is being able to take the audience, not just on a physical journey through a district but also taking people on an audio journey of what is Los Angeles.”
Alfaro chose to write about a district of L.A. that runs from Chinatown to 96th and Figueroa. Throughout his research process he was surprised by the size of the district but also the unique deep history that runs throughout it. 
“There was a lot of … redlining, there was a lot of public housing, but also there was a lot of racism,” Alfaro said. “People built neighborhoods then they were kicked out of neighborhoods, and that primarily happened for the Asian community and Black community.” 
His interest was piqued at the opportunity to show how L.A. was made through this mode of storytelling. 
“I’m a political artist — I don’t hide from that. I came to art to change the world, so I’m less interested in art as an art piece and more interested in how we use art to create social change,” Alfaro said. “For me, it’s the lasting changes. How do we use art to inspire people to want to change their lives?”
