In Great Company, an all-inclusive media startup community, aims to help women become entrepreneurs of the future. Founded by Caitlin Tran, a senior studying arts, technology and the business of innovation, the organization chartered in Fall 2017 at USC to serve the needs of female student and alumni innovators. IGC currently has a USC chapter, which is exclusive to the Trojan family, and an additional online community of 450 people in its Facebook group.

The group’s mission was inspired by Tran’s realization of the disparity between male and female entrepreneurs, especially in the tech industry. IGC aims to provide members with opportunities to review pitches, strategies for venture capital funding and entrepreneurship-related resources via a weekly newsletter. In addition, the community will host a consistent speaker series to feature female entrepreneurs.
“I’ve noticed most of the guest speakers we had on campus were white males, which isn’t a problem,” Tran said. “But it is a problem when the only perspective or role models you’re constantly seeing are the same group of people. I think it’s really important for everyone — not just young women, but also people of color and different sexual orientations — to have someone to look up to that reminds themselves that the model of success doesn’t have to look like this every time.”
Annie Oh, a freshman majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, leads In Great Company as its founding member and chapter president. Oh found the gender disparities in the technology industry alarming and jumped at the opportunity to make a difference.
“The tech industry is just not a level place in terms of gender equality,” Oh said. “And that is one of the problems that In Great Company tries to solve on a micro-scale. Ultimately, when you have diversity with founders and diversity in startups, you have diversity in solutions and the solutions you create are more inclusive.” 
IGC aims to stand apart from other clubs on campus by catering to a specific group of students. According to Oh, the club’s motto is  “Helping Women Start the Next Billion-Dollar Startup.”
“There is an archetype venture capitalists used to look for: the college dropout guy in the hoodie who later founds Facebook,” Tran said. “But when they’re doing that, they’re really underestimating a large group of young founders.”
In Great Company is chiefly concerned with entrepreneurship and venture capital funding for startups, which is considered a different culture than the “classic entrepreneurship” that comes to mind; it is in many ways considered a niche scene. 
Oh highlighted the club’s ongoing female speaker series and its importance for aspiring female innovators that have begun since last semester. Some previous speakers include Talia Goldstein of matchmaking and dating website Three Day Rule and CEO and Co-Founder Beatrice Fischel-Bock of the augmented reality interior design app Hutch.
“When you hear women come in and give tangible experiences … it’s so real,” Oh said. “When you hear them say it in front of you, it becomes so tangible.”
Additionally, the depth of what In Great Company provides for members and participants varies. 
“[IGC offers] very specific instructions and resources for women who are very serious about starting up,” Oh said. “This is for women who have an idea and want to get into the scene, but don’t know how. That’s where IGC comes in.”
While the club focuses on women in the entrepreneurial realm, it tries to remain as inclusive and accessible as possible for students of all genders, Oh says. In exchange, In Great Company asks that the members are allies of female empowerment and female entrepreneurship.
“Female empowerment is not just women working, it’s men adapting,” Oh said. “You can’t achieve change unless men also realize [they] have subconscious biases.” 
In addition to the speaker series, In Great Company offers office hours or working times with founding members and a “Pitch and Catch” event where members can practice their pitches and receive criticism and advice. 
The next upcoming event for In Great Company will be a collaborative panel with another club on campus called Girls in Tech. Taking place next month, it will feature female entrepreneurs on their experiences and accomplishments.

For student director Florence Heller and the rest of her all-female production crew, there is no time to cry over Spoiled Milk. 
Florence Heller (left) created Spoiled Milk, a film about a female college student who must choose between her father’s support and following her dream. Photo courtesy of Florence Heller.
“We’re telling a female-empowered story with female-empowered lead who’s trying to break free from an abusive system,” said Heller, a third-year graduate student in the USC School of Cinematic Arts film and television production program. “I feel like so many women go through that, and who better to tell that story than the women who go through it. It just makes sense to do that.”
Set in the early 2000s, Heller’s thesis film Spoiled Milk brings to life 7-year-old Izzy, who dreams of pursuing music, and her father Jim, who promises to always support her. Fast forward to Izzy’s acceptance to the Berklee School of Music graduate program, and Jim makes it clear that he will only support Izzy if she lives by his rules. In the film, Izzy is forced to choose between her father and following her lifelong dream.
Heller co-wrote the script with her friend Hayley Trafzer, an MFA student who is in the same SCA program. They started working on the project last April and took it into their thesis prep class last semester. The class allows students to workshop scripts and then start working on producing and pre-production for their films. 
For months, Heller and Trafzer wrote drafts, exchanged notes back and forth and began preparing preliminary budgets and shooting schedules. 
“By December, I’m sure we were on draft 30-something … We stopped counting,” Heller said. 
But by the beginning of the spring semester, they had solidified the majority of their crew. To Heller, it was a no-brainer to ensure it was all-female.
“I think that most of the conversation on campus at USC, specifically in the film complex, is about diversity in the industry and about everything that’s going on,” she said. “And I don’t know how I can run my mouth about that and not do something. So I feel like if I want the industry to change, I have to be a part of that and this is an opportunity where I actually have enough say to do that.”
The crew is still a work in progress, but Heller says they have approximately 40 women already working on the film.
“[Heller] reached out to me about shooting it for her,” said Madeline Leach, the film’s director of photography. “And we sat down, we talked about it. I kind of knew her script for a while because I knew she was working on it.”
Leach is a third-year MFA graduate student in the School for Cinematic Arts studying cinematography and met Heller at USC. She heard about Heller’s idea for her thesis film and was immediately drawn to the prospect of working with an all-female crew.
“I have never worked with an all-female crew and it’s exciting … to have an entirely female camera department and electric and grip department,” she said.
USC is one of the only schools that has a contract with the Screen Actors Guild, which allows students to work with professional actors for free. At this point, Spoiled Milk, which reached its Kickstarter goal of $18,000 in just 37 days, has almost finalized its cast, and plans are in place to begin shooting in April. Heller aims to complete the film by Aug. 8, so that it will make the deadline to be submitted in the Sundance Film Festival.
“The reason I got into film, or theater or art in general is because I wanted other people feel a little less alone in the world,” Heller said. “This film means a lot because I feel like we’ve had this amazing opportunity to finally shed light on a topic that — more often than not — the majority of people have actually experienced.”

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Amy Hogue rejected former kicker Matt Boermeester’s request to re-enroll at USC, according to the Orange County Register. His attorney filed a suit last year asking that his expulsion from the University be overturned. 
“Judge Hogue’s ruling [on Wednesday] was a setback, but Matt loves USC and will fight on,” Boermeester’s attorney Mark Hathaway wrote in an email to the Orange County Register. Hathaway did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Daily Trojan.
The Register also reported that Hathaway had not confirmed if Boermeester will be planning to appeal the court decision.
Boermeester had been suspended indefinitely from the football team in January 2017 and was expelled July of the same year following a USC Title IX investigation regarding domestic violence with his girlfriend Zoe Katz. 
Boermeester  filed a petition last August seeking re-enrollment into the school. In response to the petition, the University said that Katz attributed the abuse to the “on and off again relationship” with Boermeester, according to a USC court filing. Katz confirmed the domestic violence incident in Jan. 2017 that started the investigation by the Title IX Office, the filing said.
However, Katz later wrote a letter through her attorney denying any abuse, assault or mistreatment.
While Hogue allowed Boermeester to stay his expulsion from USC last September, he was prohibited from re-enrolling in classes or being on campus. In January, Hogue tentatively ruled out Boermeester’s request to enroll in classes for the Spring 2018 semester. 
“The University had no obligation to disregard the initial statement and accept what she said months later,” Hogue said when issuing the tentative ruling, according to the Register.
“We are pleased that the court recognized that there was substantial evidence supporting the University’s findings and actions,” USC said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will offer a new course in gender studies that focuses on sexual violence and the #MeToo movement in starting in Fall 2018.
The class, titled “Why #MeToo? Sexual Violence in American Culture,” is different from other gender studies classes because of its focus on a contemporary issue, said Jeanne Weiss, a Dornsife student activities adviser. 
Professor Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro had the idea to start the class when she realized that there are “good, ethical people” who do not know about the movement and its genesis. 
“I designed the class for an intelligent audience of people who want to know about this topic so that they can do the right thing going forward,” Alfaro said. 
Alfaro wanted to develop this course for next semester due to the “pressing nature” of the #MeToo movement. 
“Next year, the idea would be to come up with another topic,” Alfaro said. “[The class will have] the same kind of format so that each year students … will have the chance to take either a two- or a four-unit class in gender studies to really just understand their world better from a different perspective.”
Students can choose to take the class for either two or four units. The two-unit class will only require a lecture section, while students taking the four-unit course will also be required to attend a weekly discussion section. Students taking four units will also develop policy that they will then have the opportunity to present to people who would be affected by the policy. 
According to Rebecca Zobeck, a program specialist in the gender studies department, a unique component to gender studies is its ability to look at issues through different perspectives. 
“You could look at it from a perspective of health, from a sociological perspective [or] an anthropological perspective,” Zobeck said. “Gender studies is able to bring in all these different fields and this class is going to do that to give a very well rounded look at the topic.”
The class will bring activists, policymakers, journalists, filmmakers and legal experts together in discussion to talk about sexual violence and the #MeToo movement, according to Alfaro.
Alfaro said her class is valuable to students in two key ways. Students will learn about the history and prevalence of sexual violence in the nation’s culture, Alfaro said. Also, students taking the four-unit course will also be able to develop policy and learn about how to effect change firsthand. 
“[The students will] also have a chance to have an impact in their world, not just kind of learn about it and forget about it,” Alfaro said. “That’s really important to me.”

Global media leader and philanthropist Oprah Winfrey will speak at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s commencement ceremony, according to an email sent to the Annenberg class of 2018. 
Oprah Winfrey, who will speak at Annenberg’s 2018 commencement, made headlines earlier this year when she gave a speech at the Golden Globes about the #MeToo movement. Photo from YouTube.
The commencement ceremony will take place in the Shrine Auditorium on May 11.
“Oprah Winfrey is one of the most powerful and effective communicators of our time, and someone I deeply admire for her commitment to using her voice for good,” Annenberg Dean Willow Bay said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I am both incredibly excited to hear her speak, and deeply grateful to her for sharing the day with our graduates.”
According to Emily Cavalcanti, associate dean for communications and marketing, Bay asked Winfrey to speak at the ceremony and was “thrilled when she accepted. And [Annenberg is] bringing all 900 graduates together to be able to share this experience.”
Winfrey is best known for her talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show, which led several publications to recognize her as one of the most influential women in the world. On the show, Winfrey focused on topics ranging from geopolitics to self-help ideas, additionally serving as a benefactor for those who, like herself, overcame adversity. 
Now, Winfrey is a contributor for 60 Minutes, has starred in several films including The Color Purple and A Wrinkle in Time and publishes O, The Oprah Magazine. In 2013, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Barack Obama. 
The 2018 commencement ceremony marks the first time the ceremonies for the School for Journalism and the School for Communication will be combined instead of being held separately. After learning that merging the two ceremonies will limit invitations to four guests for each graduating Annenberg student, strategic public relations graduate student Anais Medina Diaz started a petition on March 12 calling for Annenberg to reconsider the invite limit. 
By the time of publication, the petition had garnered 150 signatures. 
“On behalf of the [Annenberg strategic public relations class of 2018,] the school’s response is a good compromise that allows our families and friends who’ve planned to attend and celebrate with us,” graduate student Brittany Stamoulis said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We thank the USC Annenberg administration for listening to our concerns … but in the future, we hope the schools takes into consideration the diverse backgrounds of the student body and the multiple people helping us succeed when determining how many tickets are allocated per student.”

In the wake of White House Communications Director Hope Hicks’ announcement in February that she would resign, this weekend, New York Magazine published a jarringly candid feature about her work and relationships amid the cutthroat dynamics of the White House. Best known for her enduring presence on then-candidate Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and in his subsequent administration, the 29-year-old’s silence, reclusivity and surprising influence over the president have rendered her arguably the most mysterious figure in politics.
Di Wu | Daily Trojan
And she’s confounded a number of feminists, too. Hicks is unlike the other high-profile men and women associated with the president because of her lack of offensive public comments — or any public comments, really. But her presence in an administration that has attacked and marginalized women, people of color, the LGBTQ community and other groups has indicated her complicity, nonetheless.
NY Mag’s report shed much-needed light on the motives that underlie Hicks’ loyalty to Trump, a man who has allegedly made repeated sexual comments about her body and relationships, according to other reports, in addition to dozens of even more unsettling allegations of sexual misconduct against him through the years. According to the feature, Hicks is uninterested in the president’s policy stances and politics in general; the article claims she’s swallowed her own unhappiness and discomfort throughout his embattled presidency because, to her, “the man himself” — Trump — “[comes] first.” This revelation was striking to me, as it seemed to raise a key question: What is the obligation of women to embrace politics and take stances on hot-button issues? 
None of this is to say Hicks hasn’t already taken a stance, namely by serving and aligning herself with a politician who has attempted to ban immigration from Muslim-majority countries, incorporated blatant racism into immigration policy and denied women key health services. But in her capacity as a private woman, the report suggests she is apathetic about policy. 
We tend to expect individuals of marginalized identity groups to be activists and shoulder the responsibility of fixing the very injustices they are subjected to, while we seldom demand the same of those who passively benefit from systems of oppression. And yet, members of the LGBTQ community have no obligation to walk the streets wearing rainbow flags, nor to be activists marching for policy change. In the same vein, one of feminism’s ultimate goals is arguably to empower women with the choice of whether or not to even identify as feminists. 
Often people of marginalized groups, from women and immigrants to LGBTQ and differently abled people, tend to be more aware of political developments and active in demanding change, as they are often disproportionately affected by the decisions of lawmakers. They’re more likely to feel greater empathy for and be more aware of the identity-based oppression that other groups face because of their own firsthand experiences. But just as those with the privilege of not being affected by oppressive policy have the option of not caring, people from all backgrounds should similarly have that option. 
To be clear, the act of not caring certainly isn’t to be glorified. But like all things in modern society, ideally, it shouldn’t be exclusively reserved for affluent, straight white men, and we should never pigeon-hole or generalize about the perspectives of all individuals in a particular identity group.
Hicks, like Trump’s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and most other women in the Trump administration, has done nothing for feminism in her public words and actions. All of the aforementioned women are complicit in enabling Trump, an alleged sexual abuser, vocal defender of sexual abusers and opponent of reproductive freedoms. By working in top positions under Trump, all of these women benefit and profit at the expense of thousands of women across the country who could lose health care or be denied justice in sexual assault cases as a result of policies and guidelines overseen by this administration. 
And yet, they are the products of feminism, nonetheless. They and the choices they have been able to make are the products of feminism and its myriad historical and contemporary struggles for equality.
Sanders has notably stated that allegations of assault should not even be investigated unless the male suspect has already implicated himself. Ivanka has vocalized support for the Trump administration’s rollback of an Obama-era policy requiring businesses to report salaries of male and female employees.
But whether or not they opt to use their positions of power and privilege to advance feminism, their ability to make the choices they’ve made is a mark of this movement’s progress, nonetheless. It’s just too bad that, in their cases, they’ve opted to use that progress at the expense of other women.
