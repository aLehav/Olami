Following the final 18 holes of the UC Irvine Invitational, the No. 2 USC women’s golf team finished in second with an overall 1-over 865 behind Washington with an overall 10-under 854. The same shot difference separated the two teams after the first 36-hole day.
The Women of Troy began their play on the course in Santa Ana Country Club in Santa Ana, California, at 8:25 a.m. USC looked on optimistically at the 18 holes that were ahead of them for the final day of play.
Sophomore Gabriella Then, who was in first after the first round by two shots at 6-under, finished up the final 18 holes with a 2-over 73. She was tied for first with Marijosse Navarro of Texas A&M.
Then and Navarro played through a total of five playoff holes until Navarro captured the individual title with a par on the fifth hole. The two went neck and neck with a birdie, par, bogey and a birdie on the first four holes. On the fifth, Then missed her par putt to keep it tied and to play another hole.
Then was in search of her first collegiate win. Her play on the first day was the best round of her career as a Trojan (70, 68).
Then, a Rancho Cucamonga native, has only had one top-10 finish in her collegiate career. Her previous best finish was a tie for fifth at the SDSU Farms Invitational.
Junior Kyung Kim (70, 78, 69) and freshman Amy Lee (71, 73, 73) finished up tied for 10th. Kim shot a 3-under 69 to finish with a 1-over 217, and Lee shot a 1-over 73 to finish with a 1-over 217. With Lee’s performance on the final day, she jumped up two spots. Kim, with the biggest move for the Women of Troy, moved up 16 spots.
Furthermore, sophomore Karen Chung had an 8-over 224 (76, 75, 73) to finish the invitational tied for 33rd. Senior Annie Park  finished up at 35th with a 9-over 225 (77, 74, 74) in her first spring event.
Considering that all of the Women of Troy improved their place in the invitational, it’s unfortunate that it was not enough to surpass the 11-stroke lead that Washington accumulated.
Junior Kim Santiago, who played individually, finished up the invitational with a 16-over 232 (74, 78, 80).
With Then’s first place finish yesterday, the Women of Troy now boast five players with at least one collegiate event win: Then with one, Park with six, Kim with three, Chung with one and senior Doris Chen with two. With the talented squad, the Women of Troy can expect to find more success as the season continues.
Even with the second-place finish, the Women of Troy have been playing consistently and have shown personal improvement.
They should expect similar results when they head to Long Cove Country Club in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, for the Darius Rucker Intercollegiate from March 6 to 8.

USC’s men’s golf team destroyed the field at the Jones Invitational at Valencia Country Club Tuesday. The tournament hosted by Pepperdine consisted of three rounds over a two-day span and a fifteen team field.
Atop the leaderboard by 16 shots, USC rolled to a victory finishing with a 14-under score. The second-closest team was Kennesaw State at 2-over par, and Northwestern finished behind them with a score of 6-over.
Freshman Sean Crocker led not only the Trojans, but also the tournament as he garnered a share of the individual title. Crocker shot a final round score of 66, good enough for 6-under par on the course. Crocker finished the tournament with a score of 8-under, forcing a playoff with Winthrop’s Zach Seabolt. When both golfers made par on the first playoff hole, they advanced and Seabolt sunk a birdie putt to secure the win.
“Sean Crocker has had an incredible freshman year so far,” USC coach Chris Zambri said after the tournament. “I expect bigger and better things as we go forward.”
Such high praise was well deserved for Crocker whose final round included six birdies, five of which came on the back nine where Crocker scored 5-under. He birdied 15, 17, and 18 to catch Seabolt.
Crocker has four top-four finishes this season. In the nine spring rounds Crocker has competed in, six have resulted in rounds in the 60s. Crocker has a team-high 14 rounds in this range over the course of the 24 round season thus far.
“We have big goals this year and in order to achieve them we have to win,” Zambri said. “We have to know what it feels like to win and we have to have the skill to win.”
The Trojans certainly displayed their talent with three additional players finishing in the top 11 of the tournament. Sophomore Rico Hoey played well over the two-day tournament, ending at 3-under, which was good enough for fourth in the field of 80. Hoey’s round contained four birdies. The top five finish was the fifth of the year for Hoey.
The youth movement continued for the Trojans as freshman Jonah Texeira tied for sixth with a score of 1-under and a final round with two birdies. Texeira has three top 10 finishes this season.
Junior Bobby Gojuangco also played well for the Trojans. A final round fraught with four birdies landed Gojuangco in a tie for 11th place at even par. Texeira now has four top 11 finishes on the season.
The victory was the third of the season for the Trojans. USC will next be in action on March 9, 10 and 11 at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters which will be played in Las Vegas at the Southern Highlands Country Club.

The “I, Too, Am USC” campaign, a USG and Diversity Affairs collaboration to promote greater inclusion of minority groups on campus, will honor Black History Month by spending February highlighting black students.
The campaign has spread to several social media outlets, such as Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr, which showcase photographs of students denouncing the stereotyping of campus minorities.
The organizers of the campaign include Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, executive director of Program Board, and Skylar Dunn, co-director of Diversity Affairs. Amoafo-Yeboah and Dunn explained that the purpose of the campaign was to raise awareness on issues concerning diversity.
“It’s pretty much to stand up to the powers that be, for lack of better words,” Dunn said. “Not all black and brown faces that you see around campus play basketball or run track or do some sport, and we want to make that clear. I, Too, Am USC is to highlight all minorities, but this month we’re highlighting black students because it’s black history month.”
Dunn explained the history behind the hashtag, which has appeared at campuses across the country, such as Harvard, University of Michigan and New York University.
“It stemmed from a movement that started at other universities, such as the #ITooAmHarvard campaign,” Dunn said. “So there was a lot of noise going around the country for the past two years, and now ’SC is finally getting on board.”
Amoafo-Yeboah traced the origins of the campaign at USC to a project led by current USG Vice President and President-Elect Rini Sampath.
“The team worked very hard to get the first round of images, and then Skylar and I helped out with developing the social media aspect,” Amoafo-Yeboah said. “However, we didn’t think that the people were understanding the message of the campaign. People were saying all sorts of happy-go-lucky things, which is fine, but we were trying to highlight the voices that were silenced. People have all kinds of platforms for their happy experiences, but this wasn’t the platform for that.”
She further went on to explain that the campaign has shifted to a focus on expanding its social media presence.
“Another problem was that all the photos were being pushed at once, so now we decided to take a step back and post only one a day to get more attention and likes,” Amoafo-Yeboah said. “Now we have over 1,200 likes on our Facebook page and 900 followers on Instagram.”
Dunn explained how his personal story as a USC transfer student made him realize the importance of raising awareness through social media.
“I transferred from a historically black college and now, every time I’m walking around campus, I get asked what sport … I play,” Dunn said. “I don’t like being that stereotype and to avoid it, I wear a shirt and tie to class everyday. But it got to the point to where I thought this was crazy.”
After this initial success, Dunn and Amoafo-Yeboah have more plans for the future of the campaign and the Black House, a project to create a physical space for black students.
“Right now the campaign is all over Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr,” Dunn said. “Saturday we’re doing a photo shoot of intentionally staged images with no white boards. And we’re also going to do a video shoot.”
Amoafo-Yeboah also said that they have planned to take further propositions on fundraising by meeting with administration and potential investors.
“We’ve identified prime real estate for the Black House, but we’ve decided to set a fundraising goal first and then we can be competitive in the market,” Amoafo-Yeboah said. “We just finished our draft of our executive summary and … By the time we finish, we should be able to meet with the administration and potential investors.”

The Viterbi School of Engineering is collaborating with the National Academy of Engineering, an elected group of the world’s most accomplished engineers, for a worldwide crowdsourcing competition to cast a female engineer for the new MacGyver TV show. The show hopes to inspire more women to pursue engineering.
MacGyver, created by Lee Zlotoff, was launched 30 years ago and follows the adventures of a fictional government agent Angus MacGyver, who resourcefully uses his engineering skills to solve problems in each episode.
“I was intrigued and excited when the USC Viterbi School of Engineering first suggested the idea of a script competition to help create a new, female engineer-type character for TV,” Zlotoff wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “And I was pleased that we could use the name and example of MacGyver to help make this competition a reality.”
Adam Smith, the senior manager of communications and marketing at Viterbi and the primary coordinator of this project, said that Hollywood and engineering should be working together to motivate more students to pursue engineering.
“This idea of marriage between engineering and Hollywood has been around for a long time,” Smith said. “Andrew Viterbi wrote about how we can use this to elevate engineering to a higher status.”
Dan Mote, the president of the National Academy of Engineering, agrees with Smith on the alliance of engineering and Hollywood, emphasizing the importance of exciting women about the prospect of a profession in engineering.
“‘The Next MacGyver’ search competition is an opportunity that hits the bull’s eye twice for engineering,” wrote Mote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “First, the program lead is a female engineer who will inspire young women to think about engineering as a career. Second, it provides the public a program on engineering and what engineers do.”
Smith said he and his team came up with this idea of reaching out to the National Academy of Engineering for a global competition in 2013, and they wanted to make female engineers the focus. In fall 2014, they received a grant from the United Engineering Foundation.
Smith believes that they will be able to inspire more women to pursue engineering through this project.
“In terms of changing a national culture, it requires a big catalyst, and we believe that TV and popular culture have a big play in that,” Smith said.
He explained that television is filled with problems and conflicts, and engineers are great at finding solutions to solve these.
Viterbi student organizations have made efforts to encourage local young women to pursue engineering majors.
“In terms of current efforts, this Thursday, the local chapter of Society of Women Engineers and Women in Engineering are hosting an [all-day] workshop for young women in the community,” Smith said.
As part of Engineers’ Week, “Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day,” co-hosted by the Association for Computing Machinery, hopes to inspire the next generation of female engineers by introducing the girls to circuits using Circuit Scribe, a rollerball pen that writes with conductive silver ink, while also teaching them about the process of problem-solving and invention.
Smith said Dean Yannis C. Yortsos considers the diversity at Viterbi a great accomplishment, citing that of the entering class 37 percent are women, which is double the national average. Additionally, 25 percent of the computer science majors are women.
“I think it’s great to see more female leaders in the engineering community and it shows, perhaps maybe more to younger people who are thinking about going into engineering, that women can be engineers as well and it’s just not a male dominated field,” said Morelle Arian, a senior majoring in electrical engineering.
“While there has been some debate about whether our country needs more engineers, one thing is certain: engineering needs more women,” Randy Atkins, the senior media relations officer at the National Academy of Engineering, wrote in an email statement to the Daily Trojan. “While more than half the talent pool seems generally turned off by the thought of becoming an engineer, it’s likely most kids don’t even know what an engineer does. Considering that engineers will be key to tackling the [grand challenges] of the 21st century, this is very troubling.”
Daisy Leon-Rivera, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, said she watched [the children’s show] Cyber Chase growing up because she enjoyed the problem-solving techniques and math the characters used.
“I think this is a great opportunity to inspire the next generation of … engineers of the future, and I hope it becomes the next big culture,” Leon-Rivera said.
Mentors, including Anthony Zuiker, the creator of the CSI franchise, and Roberto Orci, the writer and producer of Sleepy Hollow, will be paired with the finalists.
“Now that we’ve launched and have begun to witness the overwhelmingly positive response to this project, I’m even more excited to see what kinds of concepts and scripts the world has in store for us all,” Zlotoff said.
By creating a national marketing campaign, Smith said he hopes to raise the profile of women in engineering.
“There is an entire generation of great storytellers, and we want them to think of writing female engineering characters. Because if you see strong female engineers, it’s easier to imagine yourself [as] one,” Smith said.

Striking a balance between lowering tuition costs and increasing availability of financial aid, President C. L. Max Nikias recently spoke with university staff and faculty about what it entails to financially support as a “premier research university.”
In both his annual address to faculty in Town & Gown on Feb. 11 and his address to staff in Bovard Auditorium on Feb. 19, Nikias defended USC’s position as a world-renowned research university.
At the address to faculty, Nikias responded to the criticism research universities have recently received from the media regarding the cost and value of higher education.
He listed some complaints that have been expressed about America’s top universities. These complaints included the tuition rates rising faster than inflation, student debt increasing to $1 trillion, a college degree not helping young Americans in the job market, and top research universities being “bastions of privilege and hypocrisy,” according to Nikias
Nikias responded to these charges, saying that universities have to strike a delicate balance between cost and curriculum.
“Many of [the complaints] are true. We owe it to ourselves and to our nation to examine ourselves honestly,” Nikias said. “However, we should also ask, ‘Are we focusing too much on the cost, rather [than] on the value that a college delivers?’”
He also addressed the distinction between the United States’ top research universities and other higher education institutions.
“Today, there are some 4,000 colleges and universities across the nation,” Nikias said. “These include two-year colleges, four-year colleges and universities, and an increasing number of for-profit and online schools. Of these 4,000 schools, about 50 operate as America’s premier research universities.”
Nikias said that the 50 top research universities are “the envy of the world” because they inspire admiration worldwide, and rather than just teaching existing knowledge, these universities create new knowledge driving innovation and academic excellence.
Nikias also defended the choices made by leading research universities such as USC.
He acknowledged that even though USC’s tuition has doubled since 1984, the university’s student aid budget has quadrupled to $300 million per year — the largest in the nation.
“If USC eliminated all financial aid tomorrow, we could reduce the sticker price by a third,” Nikias said. “But this would squeeze out America’s middle class.”
Vittorio Masina, a freshman in the World Bachelor in Business program, said USC’s financial aid program is a vital component in the university.
“The fundamental goal of the financial aid program is to make the world-class education USC offers affordable to virtually anybody,” he said. “Abolishing all forms of financial aid — which is identical to giving a 1/3 tuition financial aid to everybody — doesn’t accomplish it. The current system individually evaluates each student, and assign scholarships tailored on needs and merit. I wouldn’t be here without USC financial aid system. I couldn’t afford it even with the 1/3 tuition decrease.”
With the new information technology expenses going from almost zero to millions annually, college costs have risen. Cost has also gone up as a result of physical infrastructure expenses.
Nikias argued that student loans are the main contributor to the America’s $1.1 trillion student debt crisis.
“It represents a small fraction of total household debt for Americans, which is about $12 trillion today,” Nikias said.
He said the debt amount has little to do with the value of education at these top tier universities. Citing Massachusetts Institution of Technology economist David Autor, Nikias said that these research universities provide monumental return on investment when measured against a lifetime income.
Nikias also talked about how top research universities are raising a good portion of necessary resources through philanthropic efforts.
“Our ambitions to improve the academic quality of our faculty and student body, and the overall residential experience, have indeed enabled us to flourish even in midst of a recession,” Nikias said.
He cited the $6 billion fundraising campaign USC launched in 2011, and how USC surpassed the $4 billion mark in only four and a half years as evidence of the university’s ability to thrive even in difficult economic circumstances.
The U.S. Department of Education proposed a rating system for American colleges and universities that Nikias felt was not an accurate reflection of excellence of American universities. The rating would measure three areas: access, affordability and outcomes.
“None of these metrics reflect academic value or academic excellence,” Nikias said.
He argued that a rating system such as the one proposed by the Department of Education ignore academic excellence. He continued, “[It] may incentivize the wrong things. And it may shut out many qualified students from the best schools.”
Harshini Chengareddy, a freshman majoring in global health, said that financial aid should remain a priority for the university.
“Different rankings measure different things; and in this case, if the depth wants to include affordability, they have the right to since that is a big issue for many students,” she said. “I don’t think it necessarily means USC will be ranked low; however, considering the amount of financial aid we offer [is] more than any other college in the country.”
Nikias concluded by stressing that while USC can improve in many areas, its rise as an “academic powerhouse” is attributed to “our faculty, our staff and our community [championing] timeless academic values that make education one of the society’s most crucial enterprises.”

The one-and-done problem in college basketball is one of the hallmarks of the highly dysfunctional National Collegiate Athletic Association. The NCAA has tried to define itself as an amateur sports organization, distinct from the numerous professional leagues in the sports world. But the one-year gap between high school and professional basketball only blurs the line between professional and amateur; it is by no means a fine line.
A recent proposal floating around different NCAA conferences could potentially make that separation more clear. Under current NCAA rules, basketball players must be at least 19 years old, out of high school for at least one year and play one full season in college before being eligible to enter the draft. Several college conferences are proposing that players be automatically ineligible to play during their first season in college. They would then need to play one full season before they could declare for the draft after their second year in college.
The purpose behind the idea is well intentioned. It would force student athletes to take the “student” part much more seriously. But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the rule could have some unintended consequences.
Under the current NBA collective bargaining agreement with the players’ union, high school stars cannot declare for the draft right out of high school, but can play professionally overseas for a year before entering the draft. Though the NCAA offers better competition and better exposure than the top European professional leagues, some might find the professional contracts worth more than the college scholarships.
Additionally, a lot of players who wouldn’t declare for the draft anyway would be ruled ineligible for their first year. Players who would normally graduate in four years could drag out their college career to five years, and players graduating after the normal four years would miss out on an opportunity to play for a year.
Viewing these different outcomes together begs the question of what the purpose or value of college athletics really is. The answer varies depending on whom you ask, and maybe the better question is what the purpose or value of college athletics should be.
For the select few who are taken in the NBA draft, college basketball is really just a roadblock in front of a long-term career. Even then, only a fraction of them can turn basketball into a career.
In those few cases, it would make sense for players to declare for the draft as soon as possible. Athletes like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James went to the NBA right after high school, and it was probably in the best interest of their career that they did. They were ready to play at the highest level right out of high school, they avoided the chance of any injuries in college derailing their professional earning potential and they started making that money right away. Especially for someone coming from a low-income background, that one-to four-year gap between high school and signing the first professional contract can be a big deal for the player and the player’s family.
So why not let players declare for the draft right out of high school? As John Calipari — the head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats infamous for being the most successful at capitalizing on one-and-done recruits — pointed out, we as a society seem to glorify the business innovators or tech industry giants like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg who drop out of college to go right into their professional careers.
Yet there is an obvious paternalistic stigma within the NCAA, as it requires players to “educate” themselves for at least a year before they can go off and make decisions for themselves in the real world. The proposed one-year sit out  rule is another step in that direction. In fact, it’s based on the premise that college freshmen need a year to adjust to the academic load before they can handle the travel and practice time commitments.
The cynical side of me can also smell some blatant self-interest on the part of the NCAA. The longer star athletes spend playing college ball instead of jumping right away to pros, the more exciting and marketable the NCAA’s product.
The rules and regulations become even more strenuous on the football side. Players have to stay in college three years before they can declare for the NFL draft and cash out on their playing careers. With the physical nature of football, that three-year gap becomes even more crucial as the probability of career-ending injuries becomes even higher.
These limitations on employment opportunity seem fishy in the context of our capitalist, free market economy. The NBA and NFL are both very large employers, and the players who make up both of those leagues are all autonomous individuals willingly employed by franchises within the leagues. Plenty of employers require applicants to have a college degree, but it doesn’t take one of those to throw a football or shoot a basketball — if only I could major in zone defense strategy with a minor in 3-point shooting. Instead, each organization has an arbitrary age requirement, which is also legal in hiring practices, but the requirements appear to be irrational.
There is the other side of the coin, though. If you are picking up a copy of this newspaper, you obviously value a college education to some degree. The non-cynical side of me sees a lot of value in the current NCAA model because it gives lots of people a chance at an education when they otherwise wouldn’t have one.
But ultimately, the one-year sit out rule seems insufficient at accomplishing the objective of improving the educational experience for future NBA draft picks. The proposed rule doesn’t say anything about the practice time, weight lifting or even travel schedule of “ineligible” players. If we really wanted to make it easier for students to do well in the classroom, the NCAA should reduce the number of hours coaches across every conference can organize team activities rather than reduce the autonomy of athletes to make decisions about their own careers.

Following a tough two-game road trip that ended in losses for the USC men’s basketball team, the Trojans will return home for their final two home games of the season.
The Trojans (10-17, 2-13) were blown out by No. 7 Arizona on Thursday night 87-57. After keeping the game close for the first 10 minutes, USC watched Arizona end the half on a 20-8 run.
Coming out of halftime, the Wildcats started where they left off. Led by freshman star Stanley Johnson, Arizona opened the half on a 12-0 run, extended the lead to 30 points and never looked back.
The Trojans played a much better all-around game on Sunday against the Arizona State Sun Devils. USC came out sloppy, falling behind by as many as six, and trailed at the half 27-24. However, the Trojans came out of the half a team on a mission.
Led by some great team basketball and a balanced offense, the Trojans grabbed the lead early in the second half. The Trojans let another close game slip away in the closing minutes, however. Arizona State guard Tra Holder hit a 3-pointer to tie the game at 56 with 1:50 to play, then assisted on another to put the Sun Devils up for good.
Before the game, USC sent home starting guard Katin Reinhardt and bench players Chass Bryan and Devon Pflueger for a violation of team rules. Freshman Jordan McLaughlin, who leads the team in assists, was forced to miss the road trip due to injury.
Reinhardt and McLaughlin’s absence paved the way for sophomore Kahlil Dukes to emerge in the rotation. Dukes led the team in scoring against Arizona State with 18 points, including four 3-pointers, and chipped in three rebounds and two assists.
The Trojans late game collapse against the Sun Devils was just another chapter in a familiar book for head coach Andy Enfield. The Trojans have given away games to Oregon, Oregon State and Stanford, were beaten at the buzzer by Cal, and lost to Colorado in triple overtime. A few bounces go their way, and we’re talking about a team in the middle of the Pac-12 race.
“I’m certainly optimistic about where we are as a program and what we’re going to do in the future,” Enfield said. “But at the same time, we would like to be on the other side of these once in a while.”
Luckily for the Trojans, the two teams currently at the bottom of the Pac-12 standings with USC, Washington and Washington State, will be coming to the Galen Center this weekend.
The Washington State Cougars (11-15, 5-9) will make the trek down the Pacific coastline to take on the Trojans. The Cougars, who lost four of their last five, will be looking for a win to improve their seeding for the upcoming Pac-12 tournament. The Cougars could finish anywhere from 11th seed to the eighth seed.
Meanwhile, the Trojans will look to gain some momentum heading into the tournament, as well as get some healthy bodies back. McLaughlin’s return date is still up in the air, but sophomore transfer Katin Reinhardt should return for the game against the Cougars.
In McLaughlin’s absence, fellow freshman Elijah Stewart has stepped up his game. In the three games since McLaughlin went down, Stewart is averaging 12 points, four rebounds, three blocks, two assists, and one-half steals, in just over 30 minutes. Stewart is one of two guards, along with Oregon State’s Gary Payton II, to be in the Pac-12’s top 10 in blocks per game.
However, sophomore Nikola Jovanovic has been in quite a slump as of late. The second-year forward from Serbia has been outmanned in his two previous matchups against the Arizona schools.
Washington State is led by the one two punch of guard DaVonte Lacy, currently fourth in scoring in the Pac-12, and Josh Hawkinson, the only player in the Pac-12 currently averaging a double-double. After those two players, the Cougars are relatively thin, however, having no other player averaging double figures.
The Trojans will actually size up pretty well against the Cougars, not a common trend this season. The Cougars only have one player above six-foot-10 and lack a true center much like the Trojans. The Trojans will need to continue their team play, especially if McLaughlin and Reinhardt are unavailable, if they hope to get a much-needed win.
The Trojans and Cougars will tip off this Wednesday, Feb. 25 at 7 p.m. The game will air on the Pac-12 Network.

Now in their third year as a program, members and coaches of the USC women’s lacrosse team have made it clear that this a season in which they expect to make significant strides in both their cohesion and consistency as a unit. If Tuesday’s conference opener was any indication, the team is well on their way toward accomplishing that goal.
USC convincingly handled Fresno State in the first game at McAlister Field this season, winning by a lopsided score 17-6. The team was relentless on all sides of the field and kept their high level of intensity for all 60 minutes of the match en route to the victory.
“We’re very exited about the win and starting off the conference season like that,” head coach Lindsey Munday said following the game. “We are coming off a tough weekend with long travel where we played two tough opponents … I’m very proud of the mental and physical strength we showed as a team today to come in and fight the way we did.”
As Munday alluded to, Tuesday’s win marked the third game in the last four days for the Women of Troy. The team traveled across the country this weekend, splitting a pair of games New York before traveling back to Southern California in preparation for Tuesday’s game. They dropped a low-scoring affair against then-No. 16 ranked Stony Brook on Saturday, 7-4, before bouncing back for their first win of the season against Marist, 11-7, on Sunday.
Tuesday’s victory over Fresno State marked the first conference win of the year for the squad and also evened their overall record to 2-2. The Women of Troy lost their season-opener in dramatic overtime fashion to then-No. 5 Northwestern, 12-11, in a game played at the Coliseum. Northwestern has won seven of the last 10 women’s lacrosse national championships.
Though historically Fresno State has not provided much competition for its MPSF opponents, the Women of Troy approached the game no differently than they would any other opponent and didn’t take their foot off the gas pedal until the final horn blared.
“We knew we had to come out really strong in this first conference game and play hard, and we are really excited to get a big win like this,” sophomore attacker Michaela Michael said. “It doesn’t matter who the opponent is, our approach is still the same.”
With the game tied at two after the opening six minutes of the game, USC took the lead on a free position shot from junior midfielder Amanda Johansen with 23:40 on the clock and never looked back, scoring nine more goals in consecutive fashion to take a 12-2 lead into halftime.
Johansen, who entered the game as the team leader in draw controls, showcased a strong finishing ability as well Tuesday, scoring five goals to lead the Women of Troy. Junior attacker Caroline de Lyra also had an excellent game, dishing three assists — all to Johansen — and recording a hat trick of her own as well, her third triple-goal game in the team’s four games thus far. De Lyra has now tallied ten goals and seven assists to lead the team with 17 points so far this season. Michael sits in second place with 13 points on nine goals and four assists, with Johansen currently slated for the bronze medal with nine points on eight goals and one assist thanks to her offensive outburst Tuesday.
When asked about her scoring success against the Bulldogs after the game, Johansen was quick to attribute her performance to her teammates’ awareness and unselfishness, and in particular, de Lyra’s:
“If you work hard and cut hard, the girls on this team will find you with passes,” she said. “My teammates did that today, and especially Cara. She got the assists on most of my goals.”
Despite the outstanding performances from de Lyra and Johansen, as well a stout defensive effort from USC’s back line, which forced Fresno State into eleven turnovers, the game ball of the day was unquestionably earned by Michael. In fact, Michael quite literally took home the game ball, for in addition to a hat-trick of goals, the 5’11” attacker tallied 15 draw control wins, the most ever in one individual performance in MPSF conference history.
While Michael was proud of the accomplishment, much like Johansen, she attributed her success to someone else, that of new assistant head coach Alyssa Leonard.
“To be honest, my performance today is really all thanks to coach Leonard,” Michael said. “We’ve been working on draw controls since the minute we stepped on campus this year, and to have a game like this and see such significant strides is really exciting.”
Leonard, who just graduated from Northwestern last year, finished her playing career as a Wildcat with an NCAA record of 469 draw controls, over 100 more than the previous record. Leonard’s career high in draw controls as a player in one game was 15, and so now, just four games into her coaching career, one of her pupils has tied that astounding tally. This speaks volumes about her value to the team in teaching draw control technique, and not just to Michael:  USC now has won 58 draw controls on the season, as compared to just 27 for its opponents.
Michael’s record was largely the result of her diligent hard work — much of it outside of scheduled practices — and her team has taken notice.
“Michaela works extremely hard and has put in the work all year, whether it has been in practice or in extra one-on-one time with Alyssa,” Munday said. “We are so happy and excited to see her success on the field coming to fruition like this because we know she is earning it each and every day.”
While Michael’s record and the other performances from Tuesday deserve celebration and indicate that the team was locked in from beginning to end, the Women of Troy are also aware that this is only the beginning of the conference season, and there is still plenty of work to be done in the weeks to come.
“There’s definitely still things to improve on, such as the 13 turnovers we had, for example,” Munday said. “That is not a standard we want to set as a program, and so taking care of the ball will be a big focus over the next couple weeks in practice. For the most part, that comes down to staying focused, staying poised and staying under control even when we are playing aggressively.”
However, if Michael’s performance Tuesday can stand as a broader representation of the work ethic and drive of the whole team, one can expect those improvements to made much sooner than later.
The Women of Troy’s next game comes March 9 at home vs. Liberty, the second of a          five-game homestand at McAlister Field.

The average law student would not think that their post-graduation plans include trekking around the world with a total stranger and engaging in strange tasks for the viewing pleasure of the American public. The average law student expects to find a job at a firm and plans to spend a few months holed up somewhere to study for the Bar exam. Jenny Wu, two-time USC graduate, was no different; the last place she expected to be after graduating from the Gould School of Law was on  CBS’s The Amazing Race.
Wu began to diverge from the usual course shortly into her first job as a lawyer for a fashion company; she started a fashion blog, goodbadandfab.com, as a way to indulge her affinity for fashion while handling a demanding legal career. She decided to take up fashion blogging full time when she began to receive offers to promote different brands and companies that she loved. Wu had a difficult time explaining the abrupt change to her conservative Chinese immigrant family, but they soon became supportive of her goals.
“I grew up in Arcadia, a very conservative suburb in the San Gabriel Valley — so my parents let me pick between being a doctor or a lawyer,” Wu said. “I took all the right classes, graduated magna cum laude and got into Gould.”
Law school proved to be a whole different kind of challenge for Wu, and it pushed her in ways she couldn’t have anticipated.
“It was shock; law school was like boot camp every day — it was nice to have my support system around, especially my family and the familiarity of USC,” Wu said.
All things considered, Wu’s interesting path shaped her into an ideal candidate for The Amazing Race. She decided to put fashion on hold when CBS offered her the opportunity to be a candidate on The Amazing Race.
“In law school, I learned that life is about balance — which is how I got into fashion blogging, and what ultimately led me into pursuing The Amazing Race,” Wu said.
She started the  audition process almost as a joke between herself and a close childhood friend. Both longtime fans of the show, they decided to post a video onto the casting webpage. Wu describes the audition tape as goofy, but it worked. The next day CBS called to inform her that they had seen the video and asked if she would be interested in pursuing her candidacy.
“I embarked on this long application process which included personal interviews, a written application and more videos,” Wu said. “Finally, the original person who had first called me reached out and told me to pack my bags, because I was going to be a contestant on The Amazing Race.”
Though Wu’s family was slow to warm up to her career as a fashion blogger, they have shown their undying support for her in The Amazing Race.
“My father calls me every week with tips and strategy from watching the show,” Wu said.
This season, The Amazing Race focuses on dating — it consists of six teams of real couples and five teams of total strangers on blind dates; they termed it the “most extreme date ever,” according to Wu.
Though the television cameras, exotic locations and outrageous tasks are definitely attractive, Wu said the most fun she has had on the show was learning more about herself.
“When you’re racing, everything is magnified,” she said. “I’m a lot stronger than I give myself credit for and I learned that after the race.”
Any girl who can make it through law school, reinvent her career and embark on a entirely new life path seems determined, but Wu has remained down-to-earth when it comes to her accomplishments, a quality she attributes to her Chinese roots.
“My culture really values humility, so I never really acknowledged how strong I was until I was really put to this test — after the race I live with no fears,” Wu said. “It’s about following my dreams and the race really culminated that for me.”
Catch Wu on season 26 of The Amazing Race tonight on CBS at 9:30 p.m. CT.
Law school ruined my life! I have no job and I have student loan debt that will follow me to my grave. Save yourself! DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL.

In hip-hop today, there are many artists who seem to release hit singles solely because of the novelty of the song. While this may just be a transitionary period in hip-hop, it seems as though there are only a few artists making real music these days.
There is one artist, however, leading a new generation of rappers who make real music, and his newest album solidifies his place as the torch-bearer for a new wave of hip-hop. Big Sean is an artist that won’t quit. He’s still on the way up to the top, but West’s protege is working hard to make a name for himself; Big Sean’s recent album, Dark Sky Paradise, might be his breakthrough.
The album features many artists from the last wave of hip-hop all-stars, which is complicated because all of them are still making music. Just as Dr. Dre and Jay-Z launched countless rap careers, Kanye West, Drake, E-40, Lil Wayne and others helped Big Sean make it big; their features on this album feel almost like an initiation. This is not to say any of these artists are willing to give up their top spots on the charts, but instead it feels as though Big Sean is finally an equal. Since being signed to G.O.O.D. Music in 2007, Big Sean has seen a success under the guidance of the West, but now it seems he is finally finding a voice on his own.
Dark Sky Paradise is one of the best albums of 2015. If there is only one sentence you read in this column, it should be that one because Big Sean’s work is nearly unbeatable here. He has soul and drive — both of which are clearly present in every track. His lyrical style of complex lines with broad references is so distinct that no one could match his flow. As mentioned previously, there are many high-profile features on this album, but every single one takes a back seat to the Detroit native’s voice.
“I feel like Sean, don’t get enough shine/ Is it cuz’ he ain’t got the tattoos? he ain’t throwing up signs/ Well, let me throw up mine,” raps Lil Wayne on “Deep,” proclaiming Big Sean to be the next big artist. These are heavy words from one of the most successful rappers making music today, and even so, his verse is an afterthought to Big Sean’s wild opener on the song.
West, too, supports Big Sean as rap’s next star. “You [Big Sean] is on God’s path now, and only success can happen to you,” West said, in a rare display of support. With all this support, it is no wonder this album is so good. Big Sean is joining the ranks with some of the best rappers in the world, and he’s doing it with ease.
The singles that dropped from this album instantly became huge hits, another aspect of this album that clearly spells success. “I Don’t F-ck With You” was the first single to be released, and it immediately became one of the most played radio hits of 2014, despite the censorship of practically every line. I wrote about the song when it first came out in September, and I haven’t stopped hearing it since. Produced by DJ Mustard and West, and featuring a verse from Oakland legend E-40, it is an incredibly bold first single, mainly because of its content. Even so, it was a huge success and a prophecy for things to come.
Following the success of “I Don’t F-ck With You, the next single was released within a few months. “Blessings” featuring Drake came out fairly recently, and it is already getting heavy radio play. Shortly after “Blessings” was released, “One Man Can Change The World” featuring John Legend and West was released. The two tracks could not be more different. The first is a proclamation about being on the top, aggressively moving through verses about getting money and staying famous, and the other, though featuring similar content, takes a completely different perspective on fame. Written in part as a memorial to Sean’s deceased grandmother, “One Man Can Change The World” is an uplifting ballad about believing in yourself, with backup vocals from the king of believing in himself, West.
Every track on Dark Sky Paradise is incredible. Jhene Aiko’s soulful voice on “I Know” is moving, and Chris Brown’s work in “Play No Games” is solid. But Big Sean’s incredible lyricism and style really make this album soar. Unless someone drops an album containing only No. 1 hits, Big Sean’s newest work is already deserving of album of the year for 2015. Don’t quote me on that, as we still have yet to hear Kanye’s newest album or Chance the Rapper’s newest project, but this album is a top contender and currently the soundtrack to my life.

In its permanent collection exhibit, “Changing Values, Changing Times,” the Fisher Museum of Art offers USC students access to a thought-provoking, eclectic selection that spans centuries and various cultures.
After entering the museum’s main doors, the viewer enters the exhibit’s central room, which displays “Warhol as a Catalyst for Change.”  This exhibition features a collection of the artist’s portraits of prominent political and social figures, including Richard Nixon, Paloma Picasso and Sitting Bull. As the text panel to the portraits’ left notes, Warhol’s avant-garde identity and revolutionary interpretation of visual representation is prominent in these works, with his trademark use of abstract shapes and pops of color.
The works also draw attention to the unique characteristics of each individual. Warhol subtly encodes individualism into each work, with details in the way the subjects’ features are juxtaposed with abstract shapes and contrasting colorations. For example, though the portrait of Sitting Bull is given a contemporary stamp with Warhol’s vivid block colors, his personality of power and dignity is conveyed through his red attire and grave expression.
To the right of the central room is the exhibition “Family, Society, Migration, and Changing Values.” This exhibition continues the theme of change by examining the definition of community throughout spans of generations and different cultures. For example, “Implosion” by Mexican visual artist Selma Guisande is comprised of ceramic figures connected to one another by hemp string, with a female figure in the center. All of the figures are tied to a cutout in the woman’s stomach, thus hinting at the perception of the female identity in society as nurturing and dynamically maternal.
The wall to the left of the room’s entrance features the 18th century painting “View of Rome” by Giovanni Pannini. This painting depicts the crumbled ruins of ancient Rome with a more modern community of tourist gentlemen and gypsies, thus contrasting old communities with newer generations.
The third and final room of the exhibition is called “Depictions of the Individual through Changing Times.” Whereas the family-themed room examines values and viewpoints through the motif of community, “Depictions of the Individual” does so through the individual. The walls to the right and left of the room’s entrance feature individual portraits from all eras, classes and races. The left wall features “Lost in Thought,” a portrait of a woman in a contemporary dress, surrounded by female portraits from the 18th century. The right wall mirrors this format by featuring a contemporary male portrait “Tyrone,” surrounded by 18th-century portraits. This juxtaposition draws attention to the differences in the portrayal of the individual — whether that difference be pastel versus oil, modern versus 18th-century wardrobe, or middle class versus upper class. A series of photographs across from the room’s entrance continues this examination of how the self is interpreted. Four prints by photographer Rena Small use hands as their subject. This choice calls attention to how the emotion and personality of the self can be expressed through the synecdoche of texture and shape. Similarly, the sculpture “Torso of Hercules” by Antoine Bourdelle expresses the essence of an ancient heroic figure through a single portion of the body.
The way in which “Changing Values, Changing Times” unconventionally weaves the styles, subjects and traditions of various eras and cultures together throughout its galleries creates several effects.
As curator Stephanie Kowalick states, “With this show we deliberately chose to mix both older and newer works best seen with the walls of British portraits and the Sam Goodsell works. This was done to both expand on the theme that while time might move forward certain things (portraiture in this case) remain the same but to also emphasize that portrait making takes on a new direction by tackling issues of class and race in this particular instance.”
The exhibit is, on one hand, a commentary on the power of time. Old master paintings, as well as the beliefs and traditions embedded in them, are contrasted with a more contemporary world that experiments with different mediums and social commentary. The exhibit’s blended approach, however, creates a subtle message concerning the stability of certain basic human traits, regardless of era, class or location. The attention of the audience is drawn not only to the differences between the female portraits of “Depictions of the Individual” but also to the similarities in curved lines and color palettes. Though Guisande’s “Implosion” deals with a vastly different era and culture from Pannini’s “View of Rome,” both works are commentaries on how isolated individuals can be united. By disorienting, and thus recontextualizing, works through a unique juxtaposition, “Changing Values, Changing Times” becomes both a commentary on the power and the passivity of time; the diversity of cultures and the basic qualities of humanity.
The exhibit’s arrangement of its collection provides the Fisher Museum with a unique intellectual edge. “This is not your typical Permanent Collection exhibit,” Kowalick said. “Usually exhibits like this focus on a singular time period or present things chronologically The hope is that we can inspire discussions around the works, have viewers understand that a compelling narrative can be built with what a museum holds in their collection and does not just have to come from a blockbuster traveling exhibit.”
One key message created by the exhibit is that the portrait is an enduring form. An overarching message provided by “Changing Values, Changing Times” is that the visual representation of the self, whatever cultural or temporal context it depicts, will always continue to provide humanity with a tool for introspection.
“Depictions of the individual will always be relevant to us as people because [they comprise] a record of the idea of the individual in history portrait making and taking today has moved to an egalitarian form with smart phones and digital cameras being so prominent,” Kowalick said. “The sense of self may be more individually curated and a freer in terms of expression taking a portrait is open to any one with access to the technology to do so.”
This exhibit will run until March 7, and will be available during the museum’s hours of 12 to 5 p.m. on Tuesdays through Fridays and 12 to 4 p.m. on Saturdays.

“Raise your hand if you are beautiful.”
“Raise your hand if you are different.”
— Meghan Trainor
From Feb. 20 to 21, Meghan Trainor brought her “That Bass Tour” to Los Angeles at the El Rey Theatre with the Australian band, Sheppard, opening for her. Despite having released her debut album just over a month ago, Trainor sold out both days of her show easily. That, however, does not come as a surprise, considering that her hit single, “All About That Bass,” was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the 2015 Grammy Awards.
David Wang | Daily Trojan
If you managed to snag a ticket to either of the shows, you’ve probably figured out by now that Meghan Trainor is more than just “that Bass.” I was wondering how such a new artist could have the kind of following that Trainor does, but it was obvious once she walked out on stage. From start to finish, she exemplified the charm, dazzle and charisma that her bubblegum pop debut album presents. She had toddlers, teenagers, moms and grandmas’ lips and hips moving along with her. Not only did she appeal to women of all ages, but men were also rocking along to the beat.
It’s been a while since we’ve had an artist that can achieve that kind of relatability with such a diverse demographic. She inspired cheers all around, empowering women through her emphasis on beauty and identity. The positive energy carried from the energized hit singles to her slow, heartfelt ballads.
Speaking of which, she followed shouts of encore with “What If I,” a choice that seemed a little unconventional being a ballad and all. Yet, as expected, she finished it off strong with an excellent performance of “All About That Bass.”
After the concert ended, amidst swarms of teenagers waiting for their rides and adults for their valeted cars, I overheard audience members raving about their experience. One parent-daughter duo had driven over an hour and a half to see Trainor in concert. Another didn’t mind that it was a school night for her twelve-year-old daughter. Everybody loved the concert and got way more than what they expected. For any artist to pull off what Meghan Trainor has is more than a simple feat.

An unretouched photo of 48-year-old model Cindy Crawford was leaked by journalist Charlene White this month and, unsurprisingly, went viral within hours. The image featured lingerie-clad Crawford posing for a 2013 issue of Marie Claire. Instead of the toned abs and unnaturally slim legs that usually grace magazine covers, cellulite on Crawford’s stomach and thighs is clearly visible.
Most of the comments on social media surrounding the photo have come from women, offering their support to Cindy and proclaiming this as a new platform for female empowerment. One Twitter user tweeted, “50 shades of reality. This is why #CindyCrawford holds the #SUPERMODEL title! Take a bow Ms. Crawford.” By this standard, the “evil” entertainment industry is put to shame, the female aging process is finally shown in its true light and women everywhere feel infinitely better about themselves.
When examined more closely, however, the leaked photos and subsequent social media uproar is not as empowering as it seems. First, the photo was leaked without Crawford’s consent. This act in itself defies the concept of female solidarity, given that the culprit responsible for releasing the image to the public is also a woman. Though White uses the guise of “the beauty of aging” and the truth behind Photoshop as a reason for publicizing the photo, this is far from true. By releasing images without the consent of the subject, White not only dismantles any concepts of unity between women, but also breaches fundamental rights of privacy. If Crawford had chosen to share the photo herself, the situation would be quite different; but as it stands, this is nothing more than one woman taking advantage of another. In fact, White does exactly what she claims to oppose: the objectification of women through their bodies.
The main question to consider is why people are calling this situation an example of female empowerment at all. Not only were the images presumably leaked against Crawford’s will, but the public response is also very telling. Yes, it is important that women don’t feel ashamed of their aging bodies. Though the aging body should not be seen as unattractive and embarrassing, it’s easy for a society so used to retouched photos to acknowledge it as such.
It also must be acknowledged that the real reason this image has been furiously retweeted and commented on by women, is not entirely because people feel it is a perfect example of female empowerment. However ugly and unpleasant as it is to admit, the truth is that seeing the “flaws” of someone who has always been the embodiment of flawless, unattainable beauty makes people feel better about themselves. People feel better through the reassurance that nobody really looks that perfect. Even though magazines Photoshop women until they are mere vestiges of their true selves, to see proof is not only comforting but also somehow exhilarating. Still, finding pleasure in the shortcomings of others is in no way an example of empowerment.
So what is the real issue here? It isn’t that Cindy Crawford is, in fact, a human going through the natural process of aging, nor that the photo leak is labeled as female empowerment. The real problem lies in the level of attention the photo received. It is disheartening to think that we live in a society where seeing a celebrity with cellulite is national news and that women are taught to be so ashamed of and disgusted by their bodies, even if they are perfectly healthy, that they latch onto something as small and ordinary as this. The sad reality that this — seeing a woman in her true form — is now considered extraordinary suggests something is fundamentally wrong with how the female body image is being shaped.
Of course, this isn’t a new idea. The fashion, media and entertainment industries have been under fire for many years now for the unreasonable and unhealthy image of bodily perfection that they promote. Just because this is an idea that everyone has heard before, however, does not mean it should be forgotten. If the most empowering thing women can find is a photo of a supermodel in her underwear, there is still a long way to go.

Despite an abundance of study space on and off campus, it can become difficult to find that milieu that enhances your study experience. Sometimes, you just need that ambiance and space that gets your creativity and productivity going. Oftentimes, study space is thought to be synonymous with a boring, bland room or desk, but we live in Los Angeles – there’s a certain expectation of class and sophistication in every aspect of lifestyle. Enter Bar Nine Coffee – one of L.A.’s newest members in the ever-populating independent coffee scene.
What makes Bar Nine different from other coffee shops is three-fold. First, and perhaps the best part about Bar Nine, is the fact that every day they serve a different type of coffee. You’ll never get the same cup of coffee twice in the same week, and on Sunday, you can even try all the different beans they have.
Additionally, they roast their coffee on site, right in front of you. It’s sort of taboo to see a giant coffee roaster in the middle of a cafe, but it adds a distinctive aesthetic to the design of the shop and in a sense, re-enforces the fresh taste of the coffee. Finally, Bar Nine’s location is ideal for quiet muse or study. Most of the best coffee shops reside either in the Westside or Downtown, always bustling with locals and visitors alike. Those environments are great, but juxtaposed with the quiet, neighborhood-feel of Culver City Bar Nine calls home, you begin to appreciate the remote and semi-secluded nature of a coffee shop.
Bar Nine is easily accessible from campus. Go west all the way down Jefferson Blvd and you’re there on the corner of Jefferson and Helms Ave. You can even take the Metro to Culver City Station and walk to the shop.
With its great location and tasty coffee, Bar Nine is a student oasis, bar none.

In an attempt to repudiate the unfortunate connotations of the Bush name, former Gov. Jeb Bush delineated his foreign policy agenda to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Feb. 18. Though he assured the crowd, “I am my own man, and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences,” his speech seemed modeled after his brother’s ideology: American hegemony, uncompromising approaches to disagreeing actors and assertive leadership. The ideological similarities aren’t altogether surprising when we consider the fact that 19 of his 21 foreign policy advisors either worked for his father or brother as well .
As he stumbled through his speech with an unsettling array of flagrant grammatical errors, he turned to vague and generalized rhetoric to discuss his ideas concerning Russia, Iran and the Middle East. While he did prescribe a “tailor-made” approach to each country, a deviation from former president George W. Bush’s platform, his solutions were simplistic.
When it came to combatting ISIS and its affiliated terror organizations, Bush suggested the United States “eschew diplomacy and aim instead to take them out” with a drone coalition.
The details involved in “taking them out are unclear; however. President Barack Obama has already been prioritizing partnerships with regional and international actors to combat ISIS militants for months. With ISIS interspersed between several nation-states, entrenched among civilians and leveraging complex geo-political situations, “taking them out” isn’t as simple as it sounds. Moreover, the ideas resonated with his brother’s view on Saddam Hussein: that his death would fix far greater, systemic issues.
Bush called his foreign policy approach liberty diplomacy, “a policy based on American values of individualism and liberty,” which seems to be a mere reiteration of his brother’s “freedom agenda.” He suggested that the United States reassert itself as a leading world power in global issues — but with patience. For Bush, that means instilling confidence in our allies, striking fear in the hearts of our enemies and following through with executive promises. With this, he turned to the Republican playbook, focusing more on criticizing the president than providing his own vision and concrete strategies. “The great irony of the Obama presidency is this: Someone who came to office promising greater engagement with the world has left America less influential in the world,” he said. He addressed Obama’s inconsistency with drawing the “red line,” specifically in regards to Syria’s use of chemical weapons and yet offered no alternative himself. The administration’s handling of Russia also posed several issues for Bush, who urged the U.S. to send arms to support those fighting the separatists, despite himself admitting Ukraine “is not immediately in our national interests.” He seemed more concerned with Putin’s ruthless pragmatism than Ukraine itself, which signals his focus on individual, regional interests.
Bush also addressed recent controversy over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Congressional address. As he provided his approach to Iran’s nuclear program, he called for the reinstatement of sanctions and a deal approved by Congress, which continues a tradition of hostility towards Iran exacerbated by his brother. In 1998, it seemed as though United States-Iranian relations would see a new era after President Mohammad Khatami engaged in United States relations. When George W. Bush, however, categorized the country among “the axis of evil” in his 2002 State of the Union address, any willingness to re-establish a relationship dissipated. This assertion immediately garnered backlash from the international community, which distanced from the United States for its interests in Iran. The next few years followed in intermittent diplomacy, Iran’s isolation from the Western banking system and sanctions that undermined the latter’s ambitions for growth. But amid all that, there was a willingness to negotiate. And, in 2013, we saw the first conversation between heads of state of the United States and Iran in 30 years. It is these breakthroughs that will lead to results — not binary approaches to such a complex issue.
To his credit, Bush did concede to his brother’s mistakes and promised to integrate those lessons into his own. While the George W. Bush administration wreaked havoc in an attempt to impose American values on other nation-states, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, Jeb Bush cautioned against this type of leadership. “We have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement,”  he said, suggesting elections aren’t necessarily synonymous with democracy or order. It is unclear whether that means a willingness to work with despots or authoritarian regimes who provide stability, but it is a distinction from his brother’s priorities; however, it is a distinction from his brother’s priorities. Perhaps as the elections approach, Bush will elaborate on his policies and we will see a greater distinction between him and his predecessors. Yet, as of now, it’s safe to say a Bush is a Bush is a Bush.
The critical oversight in Jeb Bush’s remarks on Iraq is he neglected to clarify that – by law and policy, precedents of Presidents HW Bush and Clinton, and reiterated by his brother – the casus belli was Iraq’s material breach of the Gulf War ceasefire. Not the ‘mistaken’ intelligence. In fact, Saddam was evidently noncompliant across the board with the UN mandates, including the disarmament mandates of UNSCR 687, at the decision point for OIF.
The critical missing piece in the discourse on Iraq is the intelligence could be wrong *and* Saddam could be guilty at the same time because the “governing standard of Iraqi compliance” (UNSCR 1441) was the UNSC resolutions. Not the intelligence.
Those who claim no WMD was found in Iraq make the category error of trying to match the Iraq Survey Group findings with the pre-war intelligence. However, the “governing standard of Iraqi compliance” that determined OIF was the UNSC resolutions, not the intelligence. In fact, UNMOVIC and ISG both found Iraq was in violation of the disarmament mandates of UNSCR 687.
For example, just because the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) “undeclared covert laboratories” uncovered by the ISG did not match the mobile labs indicated by the pre-war intelligence does not mean Saddam’s secret IIS chemical and biological labs were allowed by UNSCR 687.
I’m rather disappointed with this article. It confounds a quintessentially Republican approach with imitating GW Bush’s platform. It is filled with half-quotations and seems to think that the jury is in on Iran. Besides, what expectations can there be for Jeb to provide specific solutions more than a year and a half from the first election? These are proposals meant to incite the base that isn’t too thrilled with him, nothing more.

Sometimes, manic Mondays become terrible Tuesdays. Sometimes, the horrible blues bleed into the precious holy land of weekends. Unfortunately, the blues can hit at the worst of times and the best of times; when you haven’t been able to see you friends in a long time or you have to read an entire Dickens novel in one night. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you take care of yourself when you’re feeling sad, gross, exhausted and generally rundown from the constant grind.
1. Make yourself or buy a cup of tea or hot chocolate and find a quite spot outside. If it’s hot: smoothies! Listen to the birds and wind rustle through the trees until you finish your drink.
2. Take a study break and get some fresh air. Observe how each squirrel on campus could possibly have different personalities.
3. Make up silly stories about the people you see walking around the TCC with a friend.
4. If you have a pet play the “How many things can I stick on you until you get move or get mad”
5. Write out everything that is bothering you on a post-it note. Rip up the post-it note into the smallest pieces you can. Create a chant, calling upon the spirits of the sun and moon to banish evil spirits. Flush the tiny bits down the toilet.
6. Scream “TOWANDA!” and proceed to kick butt at whatever you need to do.
7. Eat your favorite foods. Find cookbooks and try to recreate them or try a new restaurant. Treat yo’self.
8. Talk to old people. Their storybooks are thicker than Russian novels.
9. Drink lots of water. Make your pee clear. Clearer than the directions on your next class project.
10. Eat a banana and watch Charlie Chaplin films or The Three Stooges. Boost of potassium. Boost of confidence in your ability to not slip on the banana peel in your hand. You got this.
11. Do laundry. Change the sheets on your bed and your pillow case. You’ll sleep better, feel better — and won’t feel as cluttered.
12. Go to a used book shop or a library you don’t normally go to. Find new artists and hidden treasures in the Fine Arts Library. Ask the law school librarian if they know of any weird court cases. Check out Special Collections at Doheny. Pick a book in any library at random and see what it’s about.
13. Go to one of those free movie websites, or find a full movie available on Youtube (no matter how cheesy or bad) and watch it. Watch multiple ones until you find one that makes you laugh in spite of yourself.
14. Take a nap. Just put yourself into a mini coma. The world can wait. Write down whatever weird nap-dreams you had too.
15. Get a box of crayons and use them.
16. Explore different sides of L.A. beyond Downtown: The Huntington, Descanso Gardens and Griffith Park have a lot to offer.
17. Take a walk in the sunshine and don’t be afraid to ask people permission to pet their dogs.
18. Take a nice shower and afterwards if you have a favorite lotion that smells good, use it!
19. If you need to cry — Listen to some Adele if you need to. Watch Titanic and use Jack’s death and frozen sinking to the depths of the Atlantic as a cover if you’re embarrassed. Everyone will understand if you’re upset about Jack dying in Titanic. It’s okay. None of us will ever let go.
20. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from other people. Or even a hug.
21. It’s okay if you couldn’t get anything done today.
22. It’s okay to not have a reason for feeling bad.
23. These feelings don’t last forever. Nor do they have to.
24. You’re going to be okay. Just don’t forget to take care of yourself. Any flight attendant will tell you that before you help the people next to you you have to put on your own oxygen mask thing in the even of an emergency.
25. Just think about all the dogs in the world. There are so many dogs in the world. So many dogs to pet who love you unconditionally.
 
Lame, and you’re trying too hard to be funny.
EXERCISE for at least 30 min. The endorphins will kick in and all signs of “depression” will disappear afterwards.

“So, what’s like Paris…now?”
Of all the questions I get from my friends and family back home about my study abroad experience, this one is undoubtedly the most common — and I don’t blame them. From the large displays of flowers and pens to the occasional “Paris est Charlie” poster hanging from the city’s walls, it’s hard not to recall the tragic events that momentarily drew the world’s attention to France on Jan. 7, 2015. Even after living in Paris for a little over a month now, I’m still hard pressed to walk a city block without seeing at least one cafe or shop without the popular #JeSuisCharlie slogan hanging from its window.
But overall, Paris isn’t in a state of shambles or chaos as some may seem to think. In fact, the magnitude of what had happened here still didn’t feel quite as real until I visited the site for myself last weekend. Charlie Hebdo’s offices are located in the 11th arrondissement, a mere few blocks away from where my classes are held (and where I’m typing this blog now). Though normalcy has returned to the busy city streets surrounding the site, the inner streets where the offices stand tell a different story. Outside the offices, the sidewalks are littered with memorials composed of flowers, candles and signs — visual signs of solidarity so well preserved one would think they had just been laid there.

What struck me most about Paris following the tragic attack, however, wasn’t the signs or even the increased security around monuments and museums. Rather, it was the sight of French police — often in groups of three or four sporting camouflage uniforms and armed with large assault rifles — stationed in public spaces and around the city’s many mosques and synagogues. These heavily armed soldiers have since become fixtures on the streets of Paris, serving as a jarring reminder of what occurred more than a month ago. Though the sight of armed police patrolling the streets does give an air of security, their presence is still nonetheless alarming.
But perhaps what made this sight even more disturbing to me was the way in which it mirrored my experiences walking around the holy and haughtily contested city of Jerusalem less than a year ago. The presence of armed guards patrolling the city streets is an unfortunate norm in Israel-Palestine — but it’s certainly not something I’d expect to see in the heart of Europe.

Nonetheless, to get back to the original question — what is Paris like now? Well, Paris is… Paris. The streets are still bustling, the metro is still packed and the popular tourist sites are just as crowded as ever. If the aftermath of January 7 has taught me anything, it’s that such tragic incidents force us to address what occurred and, perhaps most importantly of all, figure out a way to move forward.
Though visual signs of solidarity and security serve as much needed reminders of what happened and the necessity to ensure that it never happens again, Parisian life has nonetheless continued — as it should. C’est la vie.

Last week, I discussed the appeal of offensive jokes as a vehicle to escape political correctness. The phenomenon of humor, however, extends far beyond just humor from offense and has puzzled philosophers for decades.
It’s worth mentioning that many different theories persist to describe humor. Philosophers have posited that humor derives from feelings of superiority, violations of social norms and the repetition of a certain characteristic. But philosopher Emmanuel Kant developed perhaps the most comprehensive theory from which humor is derived. In his theory of incongruity, Kant describes that humor develops when reality differs from expectations.
In art, this mechanism for humor is inescapable. Satirical novels rely on the differences between reality and a projected extreme to create a funny result. Perhaps the most effective satire, however, lies close to the truth and yet just far enough to demonstrate a principle of extreme. Take The Onion, for example. An article entitled “New Education Initiative Replaces K-12 Curriculum With Single Standardized Test” elicits humor because its extreme is close enough to the reality of an education system overly reliant on standardized tests. It’s the kind of humor that’s funny because even though it’s not true, it really is.
Kant’s theory of disparity between reality and expectations also emanates from irony — granted, the definition of irony lies in this disparity. The many types of irony all stem from the same basic incongruity between what occurs and what should occur, given our personal experiences.
Of course, not all humor is ironic or satiric. Some humor, especially humor that results from stereotypes, is funny because it is the opposite of ironic. For example, blonde jokes are funny because we already know the punch line will reside with a characteristic we already know to be true. But maybe this type of humor is another form of disparity between reality and expectations; we expect that the joke will differ from reality, but it does not, so it is funny.
Taking a critical perspective on humor also requires scrutinizing its implications of content. Jokes that rely on stereotypes about race, sex, occupation and even hair color are indicative of a greater societal attitude towards different groups of people and can be especially damaging if these groups are already marginalized. In the novel Lowering the Bar: Lawyer Jokes and Legal Culture, Marc Galanter argues that jokes that portray lawyers as evil, manipulative and demonic prove a climate that perceives practitioners of law as malevolent and thus mistrusts them in the professional arena. When expanding his argument to all stereotype-based jokes, it’s clear that jokes that present blondes as stupid and Asians as socially awkward nerds negatively affect these groups in social and professional settings.
It’s important, therefore, to use our humor to advance the communities around us — or at the very least, to not use our humor to contribute to oppression of communities. Humor can be a beautiful tool of human connection and contributor to happiness, but it’s a little like alcohol — use responsibly.

Waking up in the morning with a heavy head, swollen glands and a stuffy nose is definitely a sign that you won’t be having much fun this week.
Sometimes, the common cold can last a mere two days, but it can seem like forever. Classes seem to blur by, soup is your new best friend and the thought of going to a party is downright dreadful.
Common feelings sick people experience:
There are some important steps to take when you are sick.
Sleep. First, it is important to get lots of sleep, not just rest. Make sure to go to bed at a descent hour and take one or two naps during the day. Getting sleep helps your body to restore and rejuvenate.
Hydration. It is also crucial to be drinking a lot of fluids. No, alcoholic beverages do not count. Go to the grocery store and pick up some juice and water. Being well-hydrated helps to replenish the liquids lost through coughing and sneezing. Because the human body is made up of primarily water, it is important to drink enough to keep it moving.
Relaxation. Taking a hot shower or bath can be a big help too. It helps relax the body and release the icky feeling of congestion. If you are lucky enough to have a sanitary bathtub it can turn into a peaceful haven. If this isn’t the situation, steaming your face using a hot bowl of water can do the trick just fine.
And then there are two different types of sick people. The first type is the person who refuses to be taken down by a cold. They still go to class, their internship, and manage to do it without looking like the grim reaper.

The other type of person is the one who moans and doesn’t move a muscle all day. This person stays in bed, watches Netflix and texts their roommate to bring food to the room.

Whichever one you might be, know that pain is only temporary. Hit up the USC Student Health Center if you aren’t feeling any better after a couple days.
