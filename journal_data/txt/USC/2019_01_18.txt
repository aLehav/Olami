“Reinvention” was the word of the hour in journalist Natalie Morales’ conversation with professor Mary Murphy Thursday. Morales shared her professional history — from her origins as a local reporter to her current television development endeavors — and gave advice to students in Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism as part of Murphy’s “Reporting on Entertainment and Popular Culture” class. 
Morales gave students professional advice and insight from her 25 years as an anchor and reporter for various news outlets. 
“It’s not a business for shy people,” Morales said. “I was shy as a kid, but when you’re out there, you’ve got a job to do. You’ve got to quickly figure out the pieces of the puzzle and learn how to operate.”
Morales started as a local reporter in The Bronx and then became a morning anchor in Hartford, Conn. On her first day at MSNBC, she was tasked with reporting breaking news on a suicide bombing in the Middle East. 
“I can just remember the whole time thinking ‘Oh my God, I’m so in over my head,’” Morales said. “It was sink or swim, and thank goodness, I kept swimming, doggy-paddling and just trying to keep my head afloat.” 
Both Morales and Murphy acknowledged the transformation of the media industry in the digital age. 
“There’s no such thing anymore as just an anchor,” Murphy said. “You need to be able to write, shoot and all that.” 
Morales does it all — she currently works as the “Today Show” West Coast anchor and has been featured on “Dateline” and “NBC Nightly News.” 
“I still get in at two, three o’clock in the morning when I do ‘Today Show’ West Coast hits,” Morales said. “I’ve always felt like I have to keep proving myself in this business. That never goes away.” 
After working as a reporter for over two decades, Morales recently developed a television show that was picked up by NBC. She is optimistic about pursuing a new path in production.
“I hope my next five years are about producing and being more on the creative side because as we see with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, the opportunities are endless,” Morales said. “With the digital streaming world, everybody is hungry for content. If you’re smart and creative and if you have a great idea, this is an incredible time to be where you are right now.” 
A self-proclaimed air force brat, she was born in Taiwan during the Vietnam War and has lived in countries such as Panama, Brazil and Spain. She is Puerto Rican and Brazilian and is also trilingual. Morales said her global multi-ethnic background and upbringing in several different countries sparked her interest in reporting from the field internationally. 
Morales said her favorite event coverage to date was the Chilean mine rescue in 2010. She has also covered multiple Olympic Games. At the 2016 games in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, she reported in Portuguese, one of the languages she is fluent in. 
Alexander Woods, a graduate student studying digital social media, said he appreciated hearing about Morales’ career changes and receiving professional advice. 
“I think that it was so special that she came to talk to us, especially since she’s working in the field,” he said. “Seeing someone who is in the field but still has the same sentiments as us — like reinventing yourself, working hard and presenting yourself the best you can in your workplace — is so important.” 
Lauren Sowa, a doctoral candidate studying communication, said Morales’ career advice can be translated to other fields. 
“I think it was very interesting and eye-opening how so many careers are very similar across different fields,” she said. “I come from an acting background. Now, I’m in academia looking into journalism and I feel like a lot of the practical advice, especially for women in the industry, is very much the same.” 
Morales ended the conversation on a positive note for students soon entering the workforce.
“Even if you don’t get that dream job out of the gate, don’t let that derail you,” Morales said. “It’s a stepping stone. You’ve got it all here. You’ve got the most incredible facility, truly, I think, in the country to learn [from], so your opportunities are here.”

Friday marks the final day of USC’s third annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Week, which featured nearly 100 events across campus. Organized by USC Student Affairs and the Office of the Provost, the week showcased film screenings, virtual reality presentations, panel discussions and live performances. 
Camille Gear Rich, the associate provost for faculty and student initiatives at the Gould School of Law, helped coordinate the events. She said one of the most important reasons for the week was for faculty and staff to gain a better understanding of the student body. 
“Our goal here is to serve students,” Rich said. “Unless you understand the experiences and the background of the people that you’re attempting to serve, you can’t fully meet their needs.”
Rich said that when she helped create DEI week three years ago, there were less programs interspersed throughout the day. This year, the programs have expanded and included more people, including alumni, and events began as early as 8 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m. 
“I’m just really excited and grateful to see that we are continuing to grow,” Rich said. “I never thought when I started this three years ago that we would grow from 20 events to 100 events … It’s now stretching across both campuses.” 
In addition to one-off events such as the Wikipedia “Edit-a-thon,” in which participants were given the chance to diversify Wikipedia’s content during a set time period, the week incorporated events like the “Allyship Series,” which held conversations with people from different marginalized communities.
Debra Langford, assistant dean of Diversity and Inclusion for the Marshall School of Business, said this was the second year that Marshall graduate students established their own programming for DEI week. The Marshall Graduate Student Association hosted a program on Monday titled “Marshall Takes the Mic!” The event invited Marshall graduate students to have a discussions on the theme “Imposter Syndrome & Belonging.”
“We know that diversity and inclusion is important when you’re talking about business,” Langford said. “To be successful, you’ve got to have cultural competency, you’ve got to understand inclusion.” 
Langford commended DEI Week for hosting events for diverse audiences  that were not only centered on addressing issues in race and gender, but also other identities such as veteran status. 
“I think it has been absolutely outstanding,” Langford said. “Every one of the workshops that I’ve attended … the audience has been inclusive in terms of [gender, race, staff and students].”
Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work Renee Smith-Maddox organized the week’s events with Rich. She credited the Provost’s office for providing the support necessary for DEI Week to happen. 
Smith-Maddox said she hopes students take more initiative in the future to help expand DEI Week in the future. 
“Our students can take ownership and have agency,” Smith-Maddox said. “If your courses aren’t doing what you want your courses to do, if there is not a very expansive way of looking at diversity, equity and inclusion, then it’s time to ask.” 
Smith-Maddox also encouraged students to take advantage of the campus cultural centers, Graduate and Undergraduate student governments and Student Affairs to launch their own initiatives to expand on the diversity of the USC community.  
Rich said one reason to be involved in DEI Week was, simply, decency. 
“You should be interested in the world around you,” Rich said. “We hope that by providing these spaces for conversation … people will begin to appreciate those around them at a new level.”

USC trustee Ming Hsieh spoke out on his temporary removal from a Board of Trustees meeting in December, during which the Board voted to support Interim President Wanda Austin’s decision to terminate Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis.
In a statement released to the USC community, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said Hsieh was asked to temporarily exit the meeting due to conflict of interest.
“That conflict was created because Mr. Hsieh was concurrently represented on the same matter and by the same attorney as Dean Ellis,” Caruso wrote. “Immediately prior to that Board meeting, Mr. Hsieh directed that attorney to send a letter to the Board outlining his disagreement with [Interim] President Austin’s decision.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Hsieh said Caruso was allegedly unresponsive to his communications in the months prior to the meeting. After multiple failed attempts to connect with Caruso, Hsieh hired attorney Louis Miller as his legal counsel. 
According to Hsieh, he already knew that Miller also represents Ellis. Hsieh said he hired Miller because he was knowledgeable about Ellis’ termination. 
“Rick Caruso only responded to me when I hired a lawyer,” Hsieh said. “I sent him emails. I called him and he never responded. I needed legal consulting to tell me as a trustee, what are [my] rights.”
O’Melveny & Myers attorneys Apalla Chopra and Steve Olson, who are representing the Board of Trustees, said the meeting invited discussion from trustees who stood on both sides of Austin’s decision to terminate Ellis. Hsieh’s attorney, they said, presented a legitimate conflict of interest.
Caruso said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that Hsieh was asked to exit the room for approximately one hour during the deliberation at the instruction of the Board’s counsel.
“We all have a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interest of the University,” Caruso said. “By [Hsieh] engaging counsel, the same counsel as Jim Ellis, and making certain demands on the University — that’s what created conflict.”
However, Hsieh maintains that there is no conflict of interest.
“[Caruso] can’t push the people around,” he said. “I told him there is no conflict of interest [because] my interests line up with [the University’s].”
Chopra and Olson said Board conversations regarding Ellis’ termination began early in October. Trustees had the opportunity to discuss the termination twice before the meeting in December.
“There’s not a set amount of time [to speak], but you have a lot of trustees,” Olson said. “And on this particular issue, many expressed opinions on both sides … Ming had already written through his attorney a long letter to the Board outlining his position.”
Hsieh disclosed Miller as his legal counsel in a letter sent to the Board prior to the meeting. Though he shares legal representation with Ellis, he was still allowed to speak at the meeting.
Hsieh claims that even though he asked to speak for 10 minutes, he was granted only one. Caruso, Chopra and Olson said he spoke for up to five minutes. The Daily Trojan could not confirm how long he spoke at the meeting.
“It is extremely humiliating,” Hsieh said. “I asked for 10 minutes.”
Trustee Edward Roski penned a letter to Caruso on Dec. 19 expressing his concerns over the nature of Hsieh’s removal from the meeting. In the letter, Roski wrote that Caruso “verbally abused” Hsieh.
“You took advantage of the fact that English is Ming’s second language to stifle his ability to make his case,” Roski wrote.
In his letter, Roski said he believes Caruso was “bullying” Hsieh because of his race and differing viewpoints. 
“All of us have attorneys who represent us; are you going to silence the entire Board, or just the members who disagree with you or come from a different ethnicity or nationality?” Roski wrote. 
In response to this allegation, Caruso said in the interview the Board comprises a diverse group of individuals with different ideas and that this diversity strengthens the Board.
“[I respect] every race [and] religion; I respect every trustee,” Caruso said. “I wouldn’t take advantage of anybody, period. I just have never lived my life that way.”
While Caruso explained he respects Hsieh’s sentiments, he asked him to step out of the meeting so that the discussion would be “privileged” and “confidential,” according to his statement.
“We understood his position,” Caruso said. “I respect his position … [and] he was asked to come back. …. Everybody in the room was given a fair opportunity [to speak].”
However, Hsieh penned his concerns over the tone and conduct of the meeting in a letter to Caruso on Jan. 11. Hsieh wrote that Ellis’ termination as Marshall dean is an example of the challenges USC has with establishing transparency and accountability. He further alleged that Caruso mishandled the Board meeting.
“You presided over an opaque process whereby Jim was removed without any legitimate basis and without informing him — or the Board of Trustees — of the underlying facts,” Hsieh wrote. “I believe you did all this to curry favor with and make yourself look good in the press — as a ‘champion’ of diversity.”
However, Caruso said the tone of the meeting was “very civil” and that all trustees were granted some time to speak on the matter.
“There was a full conversation,” Caruso said. “There was a presentation by the president, and every trustee had the opportunity to discuss, including Ming.”
The Board meeting was called approximately a week after Austin announced her decision in December to terminate Ellis from his position as dean after evaluating a record of Office of Equity and Diversity complaints dating back to 2009. In an email to Marshall faculty in December, Ellis said that the majority of these cases never crossed his desk. 
Austin’s decision received backlash from the Marshall community. Many business students, faculty and donors remain supportive of Ellis, who has overseen a boost in the school’s rankings and an increase in diversity among students.
Ellis will officially step down from his position as dean on June 30.

Musical Theatre Repertory’s newest production of “Spring Awakening” will be the third iteration to take place at Massman Theater, but cast members say it won’t be anything like its predecessors. The production opened Thursday and is the second show in MTR’s 14th season of student-produced musicals. 
The original Broadway show took home a slew of Tony Awards in 2007, including Best Musical, Best Score, Best Book and Best Direction, among others. The cast and crew of MTR’s production know how popular the musical is but hope the audience will learn something new this time around. 
“I’m excited for people to see it through a lens that is untainted by the original Broadway production,” said Tyler Ellis, who plays Hanschen, one of the main characters.
“Spring Awakening” is based on an 1891 German play of the same name, telling the story of teenagers who discover their sexual identities as they fight against their oppressive parents in the angstiest way possible — through pop-rock songs. 
The show features a score by Duncan Sheik and a contrasting script by Steven Sater, written in the style of the original play. “Spring Awakening” has been reproduced in theatres around the world, and Deaf West Theatre even produced a revival of the musical in 2015 that was the first Broadway production to provide deaf-blind interpretation. 
The show’s director, Sarah Hahm, had previously never watched a production of the musical. Hahm said she didn’t know the musical even existed until she was in high school in South Korea.
“I missed that whole fad because I had moved out of the country,” said Hahm, a senior majoring in theatre.
She said her experience growing up in a religious family provided a strong context for her to direct the show, which she hopes will make audience members nostalgic for their childhoods. 
“It had been enough time away from my youth that I could still be in touch with it but reflect on it at the same time,” Hahm said. 
But it wasn’t just Hahm’s childhood that helped bring her vision to life. Her boyfriend Jordan Fox, who is both the technical director and set designer for the production, supported her as well. 
“Because we were a couple, we talk about [the show] a lot,” said Fox, a sophomore majoring in technical direction. “The major issue with designers and directors is that they both speak different languages, they both have their different visions.”
Fox said that when he applied to be set designer, his draft for the production was almost identical to Hahm’s, even though they had never discussed their vision as a pair. Fox and Hahm said their vision for the show was rooted in religion, one of the show’s primary themes.  
At the final dress rehearsal for “Spring Awakening,” Fox said the show made him emotional, a rare feat for a production. 
“I’ve never cried at a production, except for tonight,” Fox said. “The composition just really hit home and touched my heart.” 
“Spring Awakening” will run through Jan. 20. Tickets are sold out, but the Musical Theatre Repertory encourages students to stand by for admission at each show.

New year, new me. I’m not going to procrastinate this semester. I’m going to go to the gym regularly this year.
These resolutions, among many others, are some of the most common words uttered by students everywhere at the start of a new calendar year and college semester. While these often sound like achievable, helpful goals, we all know that keeping resolutions is easier said than done. For me and many of my friends, most resolutions are typically broken by February due to the constant balance of homework, readings (if you choose to do them), extracurriculars, jobs and internships.   
While school and life tend to get in the way of accomplishing those New Year’s resolutions, there are numerous strategies people try to take advantage of to help beat those obstacles. Some like using a paper planner or Google Calendar; others find a friend to help keep them accountable.  
While I’ve tried a lot of these strategies, I’ve found the best way to maintain my goals is quite unorthodox: my wardrobe. 
It might seem like clothing and resolutions are entirely unrelated, but I’ve found a strong relationship between the two in past experiences. Updating my wardrobe and maintaining my personal style keeps me accountable to other aspects of my life — including my resolutions. When I organize my wardrobe and make effective fashion choices every day, I am able to manage my time more effectively, feel confident and comfortable and motivate myself to complete my goals.
Every three months, I go through my entire closet and donate any clothes that I don’t wear on a regular basis. In doing this, I make space for any trending pieces for the new year, like embellished dresses, neutral earth tones or accessories with feathers (if that’s your thing). After I’ve gone through my entire wardrobe, I make sure to find a trendy piece to add to my closet as motivation to finish the daunting organizational task, whether its the latest Reformation piece (they release new arrivals every Tuesday and Thursday) or finding the store with the best deals (Zara is currently having a sale). 
Dressing up for class — I mean, not wearing leggings or sweatpants most of the time — is another way to help jumpstart your resolutions. On busy days, what you’re wearing can seem like the least important decision of the day, but your clothing can make the difference between having the confidence to speak up in class and sitting distracted in the back row of the lecture hall. On the days when I take a few moments to myself and consciously choose an outfit, I go into them with more confidence and excitement because I feel good about what I’m wearing and how people see me. 
For me, just reserving a few minutes each morning to choose an outfit allows me to be more organized with other tasks that I have to complete that day. It allows me to present myself to the USC community and the world in a way that I feel more confident with. For example, if I am planning on going to office hours after class one day but don’t feel confident in my outfit, I may be less likely to go. But if I feel confident and organized in my fashion choices, then that meeting will usually go well and allow me to reach my academic goals. 
Having a few basic pieces that you feel comfortable and confident in is key to this approach. Whether I woke up late for class one day or had to schedule a last-minute internship interview, being able to throw something on that makes me feel good without a lot of thought behind it is important. 
 My go-tos? A great pair of black jeans, a blazer, a black dress and a leather or jean jacket. 
With a few basic planning steps, being thoughtful about your clothing choices can have a large impact on your mood, and can set the tone for a year of success. Take a little time this year to think critically about what you’re wearing every day, and you might just find yourself adhering to the resolutions you had always shirked before.

Although its season has not yet started, the USC women’s tennis team is already making history. The Trojans left for Australia last Saturday and will join the men’s team in competing in the first-ever NCAA dual tennis match outside of the United States. 
The Intercollegiate Tennis Association and Tennis Australia helped organize the event, which will run in conjunction with the Australian Open to promote college tennis abroad.
With matches taking place at Melbourne Park, the same venue as the Australian Open, the players have the chance to experience the grand slam first hand and watch professional players up close while traveling throughout Australia. 
The team will also be at the opening Grand Slam of 2019. The event has drawn lots of praise and enthusiasm from Tennis Australia coach and commentator Darren Cahill.
The Women of Troy will first play an exhibition on Jan. 20 against players from the Tennis Australia National Academy. The real competition will begin the next day as they open up their NCAA regular season campaign against the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. This match will count toward the team’s Oracle ITA Collegiate Tennis rankings.
USC will look to three players who are ranked in the ITA top 100 as the leaders going into the season — freshman Danielle Willson at No. 99, sophomore Ana Neffa at No. 87 and freshman Salma Ewing at No. 20. 
The Trojans will look to get off on a strong start after a promising preseason. Ewing has already impressed in her short time at USC. Aside from being the only freshman invited to the ITA Blizzard invitational in December, Ewing also won the ITA Southwest Regionals Championship. USC will also rely on more experienced players: juniors Becca Weissmann, Angela Kulikov and Constance Branstine, as well as senior Rianna Valdes. 
The Women of Troy hope to improve on last year’s middling 13-10 record and 5-5 conference record, which led to the team finishing the season ranked 49th in the country. They will be tasked with replacing graduates Madison Westby and Gabby Smith, both of whom were starters on last year’s team. 
Head coach Alison Swain was unable to recruit many players  last season after being hired late in the recruiting process. Now that she’s been with USC for a full recruiting cycle, Swain put together a very strong recruiting class that brought in Ewing, five-star recruit Willson and highly touted Estella Jaeger from Germany. According to Tennis Recruiting, these players make up the No. 4 class in the country.
The season already looks promising for the Trojans, and after a full off-season under Swain’s mentorship, the team should be much better prepared for NCAA competition. After making history in Australia, the Women of Troy have their first home match on Jan. 31 — a double header against Loyola Marymount at 2 p.m. followed by University of San Diego at 5 p.m.

While the USC women’s basketball team got off to a hot start by winning its first nine games of the season, they have now lost their last five games, a situation that head coach Mark Trakh did not expect coming into this season.
“The kids are hustling, I mean they are working hard,” Trakh said. “The only thing is that you’re not going to win too many games when you’re shooting 25 percent from the field. We’ve got to find a way to shoot the ball better.”
Yet to see a win in the Pac-12, the Trojans are hoping to change their record when they take on crosstown rival UCLA. USC is currently last place in the Pac-12 South, while the Bruins rest in the middle of the pack at No. 7.
The Trojans first faced off against the Bruins on Dec. 30 to kick off Pac-12 play. After securing an 11-point lead through the first two quarters, the Trojans’ defense collapsed in the third and fell through, trailing behind with a whopping 31 points. In what turned out to be a back and forth affair, USC lost the game 65-72. 
Despite the team’s recent skid, two players have been consistently performing at a high level: junior guard Minyon Moore and senior guard Mariya Moore.
The Moore sisters lead the team in almost every category. Mariya Moore leads in 3-pointers with 39, while Minyon Moore leads the team in assists and rebounds with 86 and 71, respectively. In terms of points scored, Mariya Moore has 208 to Minyon Moore’s 207. The closest player to that mark is senior guard Aliyah Mazyck, who has scored 122 points.
“I feel like we always come out with good energy,” Minyon Moore said. “We just have to learn how to keep that energy for the whole 40 minutes. Our defense effort is always good. As for our offense, we just have to learn to capitalize on our shots.”
In addition, junior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley has been a silent force for the Trojans recently. In her last three games, Tapley has been averaging 31.7 minutes, seven rebounds and 8 points. Tapley was also the leader in points and minutes played in the Trojans’ loss to Oregon.
“I feel like we can take anybody,” Tapley said. “We just have to put the pieces together. When we come together, we’re going to be scary.”
The Bruins currently hold a 2-3 conference record, with wins against USC and Cal in overtime. For a team that averages 70.8 points a game, the Bruins have not been successful at finishing games. Having lost their last three, the Bruins hope to even their conference record when they take on the Women of Troy. 
One Bruin player to keep an eye on is sophomore forward Michaela Onyenwere, who has played in every game this season. Onyenwere has scored 282 points, forced 19 steals and grabbed 140 rebounds. Onyenwere was a key player against the Trojans last year, playing 34 minutes and scoring a team-high 27 points. 
The Trojans are hoping to get their first conference win against UCLA this weekend. It could be the team’s 11th overall win and fifth road win of the year.
“We’re going into a stretch where we are going to play UCLA and the Arizonas,” Trakh said. “But I’m really happy that we got Minyon [Moore] on our team, cause she makes our team so much better. People think we’re going to fold out tents, but we’re not, we’re still in this.”
USC will tip-off against UCLA 4 p.m. Sunday at Pauley Pavilion.

After an Oregon trip filled with distractions and tough defeats, the Trojans are looking to steer their season back in the right direction with a home win over crosstown rival UCLA.
“Coming off a two-game losing streak, we’re kind of hoping this is a game we can bounce back from,” junior forward Nick Rakocevic said. “We want to be put in a good position for the rest of the Pac-12. This is going to be a big win for us.”
The Bruins are 3-1 in conference play, with their only loss to Oregon State. Since moving on from head coach Steve Alford, UCLA’s offensive game has noticeably improved; they are averaging over 85 points per game under interim head coach Murry Bartow. The Bruins will walk into the Galen Center as the leading scorers of the Pac-12. 
However, the Trojans should be able to combat this newfound Bruin offense, seeing as they’ve given up over 80 points just once over their last six games. That one game, a blowout road loss to an undermanned Oregon Ducks squad, is an outlier in the recent strides USC has made over the last month and is a game the Trojans can’t wait to put behind them.
“For five games, we’ve played very good defense,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We played well on offense, our turnovers are way down, and our assist totals are up. The only game we played poorly in the last six games has been the Oregon game.”
Enfield attributed the team’s debacle in Eugene to “distractions.” Chief among them was the abrupt indefinite suspension of projected lottery pick and freshman guard Kevin Porter Jr. Porter’s status was set to be re-evaluated upon the team’s return to campus, but it remains as much of a mystery today as it was in Oregon. 
“He has not been cleared to compete in games,” Enfield said. “He’s working on some things off the court and he has very clear expectations that he has to meet. As he progresses, we will re-evaluate his status to participate in competition.”
Not knowing whether his star freshman will be in uniform or in street clothes, Enfield will have to rely on the steady hands of upperclassmen, as he has been doing for much of the season. 
However, those upperclassmen have tough matchups awaiting them on Saturday afternoon. No matchup will be more anticipated than the duel between two of the Pac-12’s best scorers — UCLA sophomore forward Kris Wilkes and USC senior forward Bennie Boatwright. 
Even though both players are currently  top-five scorers in the conference, their methods couldn’t be more different. Look for Boatwright to play an efficient game both near the basket and out on the perimeter, while Wilkes will operate with an unchallenged green light, as his 247 field goal attempts suggest. He leads the Pac-12 in shot attempts.
The other marquee matchup to look forward to is the interior battle between Rakocevic and UCLA freshman center Moses Brown. At 7-foot-1, Brown will be one of the toughest matchups for Rakocevic in conference play. 
“He’s kind of a bruiser and a big guy, so it’s going to be fun to go up against somebody like that,” Rakocevic said. “As good as he is, that matchup should be a lot of fun to see.”
That matchup and more will be on display Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Galen Center as USC looks to improve to 3-2 in Pac-12 play with a win over UCLA.

USC Athletics is in a tailspin. It’s plain and simple. What was once an athletic powerhouse for the nation’s best football players, basketballers and ball players has turned into a disappointment this past year.
The fall semester is in the books, and with it, all of the despair that came with the 2018 football season. Though the burn of the Kliff Kingsbury fiasco is still a fresh wound on the body of USC Athletics, the department has to put it behind them and focus on bringing itself out of the downward spiral.
At this point, what’s done is done. There is no changing the 5-7 football record, the heart-crushing losses to UCLA and Cal — and Clay Helton is still here to stay. Right now, fans need hope, and Athletic Director Lynn Swann can provide that by landing a big-name coach as the offensive coordinator. 
The football team isn’t the only team that fans have lost hope in — the men’s basketball team is midway through the 2018-19 basketball season, and USC fans are starting to sense a bit of déjà vu. The hype leading up to this season was high with the addition of freshman shooting guard Kevin Porter Jr., but fans have been left with much to desire, as the Trojans are sitting at 9-8 overall with a 2-2 conference record. Moreover, the standout freshman is currently suspended indefinitely.
Head coach Andy Enfield and co. have the opportunity to ignite faith in fans if they can pull out a win against UCLA Saturday. Last season, the Trojans fell in both matchups to the Bruins.
The 2018 spring season was not kind to many USC teams. The baseball team finished below .500 with a 26-28 record that had every chance in the world to be better. The men’s volleyball team did even worse, with an abysmal 8-20 record. Even the lacrosse team, which was touted as a national championship contender at the onset of the 2018 season, didn’t live up to the hype, posting a 10-8 record.
While there were a lot of teams that failed to live up to expectations last year, another bad season for USC baseball has the potential to cement itself as the next installment of the ongoing tailspin for USC. 
A majority of the world’s best up-and-coming ball players live right in USC’s backyard, and with the baseball team’s status, USC should have no problem recruiting the cream of the crop.
Historically, the USC baseball team is one of the most prestigious collegiate ball clubs. With 12 national championships and in 21 College World Series appearances starting in 1948, it’s hard to imagine this team as not competitive. 
Watch one conference game from the 2018 season — it just looks sloppy. Going into the 2019 season, things need to tighten up. A group of 14 newcomers should help breathe some new life into a now-deflated team, especially considering that the 2019 class is ranked 14th in the nation by Baseball America. 
To the Trojans’ credit, the 2018 season was a building block on the atrocious 21-34 record posted in 2017, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. If head coach Dan Hubbs and co. can emphasize the importance of eliminating mental mistakes, especially on the basepaths, and sort out the pitching situation, the Trojans should be headed for their first winning season since 2015.
USC Athletics has become something of a meme on campus. These students, fans and alumni don’t identify with a losing team, and having so many disappointing teams at USC is incomprehensible. They can’t handle much more. If the water polo teams didn’t exist, oh boy — USC would be in deep trouble.

It doesn’t take more than a few seconds of watching Shalexxus and Shaqquan Aaron interact to recognize that their relationship runs deep. Moments after each question, they begin to bicker in the way only siblings can, arguing over whose recollections of their childhood are more accurate amid a flurry of verbal jabs. Three and a half years separate the siblings, but that seems to be one of the only things that does. 


It’s only fitting that they both ended up playing collegiate basketball at USC — Shalexxus, a redshirt freshman on the women’s team, and Shaqquan, a redshirt senior on the men’s — even if they took different paths to get there.


Raised on the game


Basketball has always tied the Aaron siblings together. Shaqquan recalled watching his brother Shaddean, the eldest Aaron sibling, practice every day with their dad.


“I would just try to imitate what he would do,” Shaqquan said. “Then when Shalexxus came along, she would imitate what I would do, and then eventually she started working out with me.”


Hooping was the family craft, passed down from mother and father to their three children — all of whom went on to play Division I basketball (Shaddean played at Mercer from 2004-08). Contrary to the Ball family-like image that the Aarons might conjure, their parents, Carl and Madinah Aaron, never forced their children into the sport. It was simply what they loved, and each child was eager to pick up the game from their talented family members.


“My parents were really never like, ‘You have to play basketball, that’s the sport we’re gonna put you in, and you’re gonna like it,’” Shalexxus said. “That wasn’t the case. I was just like, ‘I wanna play basketball,’ and my dad said, ‘I’ll teach you.’”


Their parents acted as their coaches growing up.


“People these days have trainers,” Shaqquan said. “Our trainer was our dad and our mom.”


For Shalexxus, it wasn’t just her parents that taught her how to play basketball at a young age.


“Everything I know I learned from my parents, but especially from Shaqquan,” she said.


From the moment she could dribble and shoot a ball, Shaqquan was playing one-on-one with her.


“It was very competitive,” Shaqquan said. “She used to cry all the time.”


Shalexxus shot back: “First of all, I didn’t cry.” (“Yes you did,” Shaqquan responded.)


“I did not cry,” Shalexxus emphasized. “I would complain to my parents because [Shaqquan] would block my shot.”


And though they told him to stop, Shaqquan never did, something his sister is now thankful for.


“I’m grateful for it, because I learned how to get over it and use certain moves to not get my shot blocked,” Shalexxus said. “It paid off. So yeah, it was competitive. We would both be in each other’s heads.”


Even now, watching each other play invokes flashbacks of the other’s game, a testament to the countless hours they’ve spent on the court together over the years.


“A lot of his teammates come up to me and say it’s scary how identical we are in our game,” Shalexxus said. “We shoot the same, our handles are the same. He taught me stuff, and I teach him too. Just watching him play, I would look at his movement, or the way he moves his feet, or his follow through on his shot.”


Becoming Trojans


Intertwined as they’ve always been, Shaqquan and Shalexxus came to USC following very different paths.


Shaqquan dominated the high school scene in Seattle, where the family moved during his junior year, averaging 19.7 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his senior year en route to a state title and Washington Player of the Year. A highly ranked recruit, Shaqquan committed to Louisville, where he spent his freshman year of college before transferring to USC. Now in his final year as a redshirt senior, he’s averaging career-highs in points, assists and rebounds per game.


Shalexxus was also a high school standout, averaging 18.1 points per game her senior season on her way to being named Athlete of the Year by the Riverside Press Enterprise. Shalexxus committed to USC, a choice she made for herself. She said Shaqquan’s position on the men’s team did not factor into her decision.


“Not in a negative way,” she said. “I was being recruited by ’SC before Shaqquan went to ’SC. I came here because I wanted to play for [former women’s basketball head coach] Cynthia Cooper. I had a great relationship with the coaching staff, loved the school, the education is phenomenal here. Shaqquan was just a super dope bonus. But I came here because I wanted to come here.”


That decision seems to be paying dividends for her team. After missing her freshman season due to a knee injury, she’s been finding her groove as an electric 3-point shooter, averaging 52 percent from behind the arc.


Beyond basketball


Integral as the sport has been to their connection, the bond between the two has never ended at the boundaries of the basketball court. Junior forward Nick Rakocevic, a teammate of Shaqquan’s, described the siblings’ dynamic off the court.


“I always see them together dancing and doing fun stuff, and that’s always a good sight,” Rakocevic said. “Apart from basketball, they got things to relate to. Their relationship is really special from what I see.”


Shaqquan confirmed this.


“Now that she’s older, she branches off and hangs out with her friends, but when she was younger she always wanted to hang out with me and my friends, so I had to bring her along. Hated it,” he said, with a small eye roll and a grin. “Now that we’re older, we appreciate each other, we hang out with each other a lot.”


A quick glance at both of their Twitter feeds reflects their shared interests. Both are littered with — among other things — superhero movies, for which they both eagerly profess shared love.


“We go see every Marvel and DC movie together,” Shaqquan said.       


Comic book culture was a huge part of their household, a love passed down by their father that has stuck with them to this day. Shaqquan doesn’t hesitate to talk about his collections of comics and his love for Marvel productions.


“I’m in the golden age of TV, so I’m lucky I get to see what I collected and looked at all my childhood now put on screen,” Shaqquan said.


Shalexxus agreed before her brother quickly interjected.


“It was more whatever I watched, she watched, so she tagged along and now she loves that stuff,” Shaqquan said. “Most of the stuff you watch, you watch because of me.”


Shalexxus shot back: “No, you take credit for everything!”


Shaqquan and Shalexxus have been connected by basketball for as long as they can remember. The hours on end spent practicing or arguing with each other have brought them together in a unique way. As big as basketball is in the Aaron siblings’ lives, their bond comes before all else.


“A lot of people tell us the relationship we have isn’t what most people see,” Shalexxus said. “We’re just really close and don’t let anything get between that, whether it’s basketball, or life, or anything.”

In the age of #MeToo and amid a gender-based revolution within Hollywood, the documentary “Half the Picture” explores a pressing industry query: Why are there so few female filmmakers? As part of USC’s third-annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Week, the School of Cinematic Arts Council on Diversity & Inclusion and USC Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics jointly presented a screening and discussion of the film Wednesday night. 
Director Amy Adrion’s debut feature comprises heartfelt interviews with prominent female directors — Ava DuVernay, Catherine Hardwicke, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Lena Dunham, to name a few — about their early careers, creative visions and the industry’s sexism. The film is further strengthened  by conversations with gender equality experts, journalists and professors, who contextualize the experiences women directors face within greater structures of systemic discrimination.
Following a showing of the 94-minute film, which was an official selection at Sundance and SXSW Film Festivals in 2018, Adrion took the stage for a Q&A session. She was joined by filmmaker Patricia Cardoso, one of the directors featured in the documentary; Melissa Goodman, the Director of Advocacy at the ACLU of Southern California and moderator Tara McPherson, Chair and Professor of Cinema and Media Studies at SCA.
McPherson kicked off the discussion by asking the panelists if they had encountered moments when they needed to resort to what “Transparent” creator Jill Soloway referred to in the documentary as “low-level bitchery” to accomplish their goals. 
“I think you do find a moment where you’re kind of sick of trying to make everybody else happy and it’s time to just be and assert myself when I feel it’s needed,” Goodman said. “I find a relative sense of safety and privilege in doing that.”  
The women also discussed how the reception of “Half the Picture” has been shaped by its timely release in a moment when stories about gender, sexual harassment and inequity are increasingly common. 
“[The sexual assault conversation] was tricky stuff that I knew was important to include as part of women’s experiences in the business, but I didn’t want to make a film about that,” Adrion said. “This is a film celebrating these women, so I wanted to give [them] a proper place in the film where they remain the protagonists at the center of their own stories.” 
The industry experiences shared by the women interviewed in the film, chief among them sexist hiring policies and the lack of accountability, resulted in an 18-month investigation into gender discrimination by the ACLU. McPherson inquired as to updates about the consequent, ongoing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation — to which Goodman offered hopeful advice but no concrete answers.  
“The reality is that … processes like this can take years,” Goodman said. “In the meantime, you have to just figure out what to do to keep the pressure on, to keep the conversation going.” 
McPherson praised the film for its intersectional representation of Hollywood and its careful attention to specific obstacles faced by women directors. Each panelist then recounted a story of how female mentorship positively impacted her career. 
Cardoso recalled crying out of anger upon receiving her first big break after 15 years in the entertainment business. She realized she had been internalizing her setbacks, which she now attributes to the prejudiced industry. 
“I think the [issue of] internalization is huge,” Cardoso said. “[Like] many other female directors, I felt for forever that it was my fault, that I did something wrong to deserve [my failures]. How come I directed this incredible movie that got all these awards, but then I cannot get a job? … Then you see these statistics, like that women of color are .006 percent [of all directors] and I’m like, ‘Why? No wonder I can’t pay my rent!’” 
The conversation was then opened to the audience, spurring personal anecdotes of sexual harassment in the film business, emotional thanks to Adrion for her touching film and questions about how young women can remain resilient in the face of the industry’s “heartbreaking” gender imbalance. 
“At networks, at production companies, at studios, at agencies, at financiers — almost all the big shots in this world are men,” Adrion said. “It’s a fucked up system for women … We’re at a disadvantage because we tend to not be in those positions of power … [We just have to] try to be as tough as we can be to not let that stuff beat us down.” 
The discussion ultimately ended on a hopeful note, with Goodman adding, “Keep doing it constantly, even when it seems like it’s not working.”
