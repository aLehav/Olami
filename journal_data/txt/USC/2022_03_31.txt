Students, faculty, staff and visitors will no longer be required to fill out the daily symptom screener, Trojan Check, to access USC campuses beginning April 4, the University announced in a communitywide statement Thursday. With coronavirus rates remaining low across Los Angeles County — the seven-day daily average was around 0.7% — the move is the latest change in the University’s coronavirus mitigation policies, which have been significantly lifted to align with L.A. County and City of L.A. guidelines.
The CARE Crew will no longer be staffing the University Park Campus perimeter to verify compliance with Trojan Check. For the time being, the physical infrastructure around the University will remain in place “should conditions necessitate the reintroduction of perimeter access controls in the future,” the University wrote in the statement.
Trojan Check was implemented in June 2020 as a screening mechanism for vaccination status and symptoms. If the user answers “yes” to any of the symptoms listed on the Trojan Check app or website, if a student did not complete their weekly surveillance coronavirus test — before the testing requirement was lifted March 1 — or if they did upload proof of full vaccination, they were barred from accessing campus. 
Come 2021, Trojan Check had additional requirements for compliance — both the “Health, Hygiene and Safety” online module and a flu vaccine became required in order to have a compliant Trojan Check. To be compliant in Spring 2021, undergraduate students were required to test twice a week. In Fall 2021, the screening allowed fully vaccinated students to be compliant with one test a week. 
Though students no longer need to fill out the symptom screener starting Monday, students should continue to monitor their symptoms whenever coming to campus and although no longer required, the Trojan Check wellness assessment will remain available to those as a tool to help monitor symptoms. 
Masks remain highly recommended and are still required in certain indoor settings including health care facilities and on public transportation, such as the USC shuttles. Students, faculty and staff can request N95 masks at no cost.

The USC men’s football team went 4-8 last season after an initial home win against San José State, followed by defeat after defeat. Yet, attendance didn’t seem to wane throughout the course of the home games, with the number of spectators rarely dipping below 50,000, even when these games lasted almost four hours. 
The USC men’s basketball team, on the other hand, fared much better than its helmet-donning counterparts. 
With an initial winning streak of 13-0,  a loss at Stanford in early January turned the tide. Although USC ended up entering the NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed, they were knocked out in the first round against Miami. 
Attendance in December sat at a meager 2,000 to 4,000. However, as our successes as a team began to ramp-up, attendance managed to reach the likes of 10,000 to 13,000 — a record-high student section was even recorded at the game against UCLA.
As important as it is for students to go out and support their athletes, there comes a point where discrepancies in attendance start to become painfully obvious. 
As of right now, the USC women’s beach volleyball team has an incredible record of 15-1. Yet, very few, if any, students seem to be aware. Similarly, the school does little to nothing to promote the team. For the football, basketball and even baseball teams, posters and banners were propped up along Jefferson. For the women, there’s little to nothing.
There’s a similar story for women’s lacrosse. The Trojans have gone 7-2 so far this season and the attendance for these games is extremely disheartening. And, once again, there’s little to no promotion from the school. 
However, rather than strictly analyzing the attendance of these games, there’s quite a bit of telling from Trojan Fever — the organization responsible for updating, promoting and incentivizing students to attend various sporting events — and its subsequent app.
One of Trojan Fever’s key features is the ability to garner points for attending games, and later being able to exchange those points for prizes such as T-shirts and jerseys. Men’s basketball games were always worth 200 during the season. Everything else is worth 300 points. The organization assumed, correctly, that more students would attend the men’s games rather than the women’s, and subsequently incentivized those predictably less popular games more.
This is not a uniquely USC trend. According to NPR, “The NCAA spends more on male athletes than female ones on average” because there has always been more emphasis and importance placed on men in sports, even when there’s a women counterpart that may perform just as well or better.
The reason attendance remained so consistent for football games is because USC has historically been known as a football school, and rightfully so. The school boasts 25 Rose Bowl championship wins, with the second-best school, Ohio State, trailing at 9.
How many would be aware that USC is also known for its women’s beach volleyball? Last year our record went 30-4. What about women’s water polo? USC athletes won five medals at the Tokyo Olympics with 10 Trojans competing on the team. The school is internationally acclaimed for these two sports, but USC has not even attempted to brand themselves as a “beach volleyball” or “water polo” school.
After a few good seasons USC was more than ready to jump on the “basketball school” name tag. Where’s the same energy for our female  athletes?
This isn’t just a branding problem, it’s a student problem. As unfortunate as it is, the school will only place effort into promoting their female athletes if they see that students respond well. So it’s time to start supporting all Trojans, regardless of gender.

Passing by her friend, Jose Torres, in USC Village, Logan Christianson was handed a note card encouraging application to the Trojan Knights — a prominent spirit and service organization on campus known for its “tight-knit brotherhood.” Torres, one of the Knights’ outreach coordinators this semester, told her to pass it along to her friends. Christianson clarified — “Just the boys, right?” For the first time since 1921, the answer was “no.”
A male-dominated organization for most of its 101-year history, the Knights accepted women to its new member class this semester. As is the case with all Recognized Student Organizations, Knights’ membership remained open without discrimination to all genders and gender identities. The organization has had non-male and non-binary members, but women hadn’t previously been accepted to its ranks.
“For a long time, we’ve always, hypothetically, been able to accept applicants that are women,” said Ivan Paredes, a sophomore majoring in health and the human sciences, who serves as the Knights’ president. “This is one of the first years that we’ve had applicants that are women that were essentially filling out a serious application to enter the organization.”
Applications from women, Paredes said, had previously been “silly” and “jokey,” but this semester, the women applicants “interviewed well” and “fit the ideals of a Trojan Knight.” Out of a class of 25, five new members are women-identifying. 
Christianson, a freshman majoring in international relations with an emphasis on global business, said she applied because she “loves everyone” she had met from Knights and knew that “Knights is one of the best ways to get involved on campus.”
“Every single guy that I’ve known and that I’ve met through Knights are just stand up, great people — the type of people that you want to be like lifelong friends with,” said Christianson, adding that she’s excited to hang out and volunteer through the organization as one of the “homies.” 
While interviewing for the organization, Christianson said that she emphasized the importance of brotherhood to her. The term is woven into the Knights’ mission statement and is one of its three pillars, along with service and spirit, but Paredes said the organization welcomes all despite its perhaps “gendered” language.  
“I believe that women can fit in a brotherhood,” Paredes said. “The language isn’t too deep to me, but I want to make it accessible and acceptable to everybody.”
In his position as the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council director in Fall 2021, Paredes pushed to “open up” the Knights to identities he noticed were lacking in the organization. Reception from other members to the expansion of membership was “less mixed” than he expected, and there was “essentially nobody in the organization that didn’t want it to change,” he said. 
Paredes said he strives to create an open dialogue among the new members about their comfort levels and feelings about brotherhood, but he doesn’t want to place all the pressure on the women members to drive change. 
“As a Black person, I’ve been in spaces where it’s kind of been my burden to make places more accessible, even though it really shouldn’t have been my burden,” Paredes said. “I feel the same way towards women in the organization.”
Another new member, Julia Haffie, knew a friend from high school in the Knights who encouraged her to apply. The new member process has been “so much fun,” Haffie said, and although the terminology the organization uses bothers her “a little bit sometimes,” the Knights have made her feel “comfortable.”
“The language is super old, and it has been traditionally men but the values underneath it, like the way that the people on leadership of Knights describe the values of brotherhood, it’s more like family than male-oriented,” said Haffie, a freshman majoring in human biology.
Paredes said he credits the rise in applications from women, in part, to broader outreach programs this semester. Torres, one of the outreach chairs alongside Ruben Nuñez, said that while the two weren’t “targeting any certain demographics,” they aimed to reach out to as many people as possible for recruitment. The pair utilized social media posts, info sessions and a variety of engagement events hosted at the start of the semester — including field day, dodgeball and Bob Ross night — to spread the word. 
Torres said the change to accept women was a “long time coming,” and the new women members add to the environment “in every way possible.” He said he believes “brotherhood” to be a gender-inclusive term but wants to continue to have conversations about the Knights’ image and presentation. Steps the organization has taken, Torres said, include encouraging members not to assume pronouns and shifting away from language that “alienates” women. 
The Knights’ constitution changed over the past two semesters, Paredes said, to modify objectively gendered words to more inclusive ones, including changes from “brother Knights” and “men” to “fellow Knights” and “people.”
“Yes, we are very male-presenting. Like a lot,” said Torres, a freshman majoring in astronautical engineering. “Why is that and what can we do to change that?”
A spirit leader her freshman and sophomore years, Veronica Matthews, a senior majoring in business administration, has always been passionate about USC. After hearing that the Knights were encouraging non-male identifying applicants, Matthews decided to join the Knights during the second semester of her senior year because she “didn’t want to have any regrets.” 
Painting at games — a Knights tradition wherein members write team numbers or spirited messages on their bare chests — was something Matthews had always wanted to be a part of, but she wasn’t sure how it would work for the women in the organization. Donning a red bandeau bra with spirit paint overtop, Matthews said she made one of her “core memories” painting with the Knights at a basketball game. 
Other Knights have treated Matthews as “one of their brothers,” and have given her the opportunity to speak up if she becomes uncomfortable.  
“I was, of course, worried going into it — I think any woman would be — but any doubt I had, any fear I had about not being treated like everybody else in the organization was quickly dispelled,” Matthews said.  
Diego Dela Rosa — one of the organization’s non-male identifying members — has been a part of the Knights since Spring 2020 and said the Knights community was extremely supportive when they came out as gender-queer during the pandemic. 
“I actually depended a lot on people I’ve met in Knights when I was going through that, and they offered me so much support and were just there throughout the process,” Dela Rosa said. 
While the organization operated remotely, Dela Rosa, a senior majoring in visual and performing arts, was invited to conduct a presentation to general members about “ways we can support other non-male identifying people.” Overall, Dela Rosa said, despite being “a little bit scared” before coming out to the Knights, it has been a “great journey.”
The Knights have not been immune to reports of hazing and inappropriate conduct — the organization was inactive in 2018 following misconduct allegations. While none of the members interviewed were present during the suspension, Paredes, who joined three semesters ago, said the organization has made “drastic steps away from 2018,” which he said was further encouraged by the conversations sparked by last semester’s reports of sexual assault and misconduct at fraternities on Greek Row. 
“Especially with last semester with Greek life, that was another igniting factor that kind of reminded us of why we need to take steps further away,” Paredes said. “Because, certainly, if you don’t have these conversations, people forget about them.”
The Knights’ current faculty supervisor and former Knight Joe Way said the organization believes that many allegations brought to the light in 2018 “were not necessarily true of the org as a whole.” 
“The organization did talk about how they wanted change,” said Way, who also serves as the director of learning environments for the University’s information technology services. “They wanted to move beyond what was thought about the org.”
Way said the move to accept women is a reflection of the Knights “growing as society grows” by forefronting inclusivity and said he looks forward to other campus organizations following in the Knights’ tread. 
Helenes — the partner organization of the Knights and the “official hostesses of the University of Southern California” — is founded on similar tenets, such as spirit, service and tradition. Helenes are “united in sisterhood,” the organization’s website reads, and have historically been composed of women, although there are non-women identifying members currently in Helenes, said Emilee LeVeque, the organization’s director of public relations. 
LeVeque, a sophomore majoring in political science, said that with the recent expansion of membership to gender non-conforming members came changes in the language the Helenes use — including a shift from the “sisterhood” pillar to more inclusive terms such as “family,” though “sisterhood” remains in the organization’s mission statement. Helenes has not received applications from cisgender men in any of its applicant cycles, but LeVeque said she believes that “if they make a good Helene, they should be in Helenes.”
“I believe Helenes is definitely open to accepting them,” LeVeque said. “We want to make sure that we have people who we do believe would be a good fit within our organization.”
A merger of the Helenes and the Knights is not expected any time soon, LeVeque said, as the structure and culture of the organizations vastly differ. 
“To my knowledge, we don’t plan on doing that,” LeVeque said. “We both internally are structured so differently that I don’t think that’d be a feasible thing to be able to go to combine our orgs.”

With shouts of “justice for janitors!“ and “sí se puede!” to rally their colleagues, about 60 USC janitorial workers and supporters held a protest Wednesday expressing their demands of higher wages proportional to inflation rates in Los Angeles and affordable healthcare benefits. The protest began in front of Tommy Trojan before migrating to the center of USC Village with protesters expressing their willingness to strike. 
“We’re telling USC: You either pay up, make sure you pay these workers a just wage, make sure they have the benefits to be able to take care of their families,” said David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West. “If they’re not prepared to do that, then we’re willing to go on strike.”
David discussed the current state of negotiations between their employer, Aramark, and the custodial workers at USC. The contract currently in effect will expire Thursday after a three-month extension. Antonio Solis, a driver for the SEIU, said the workers are prepared to demand another extension from the Labor Commission if an agreement is not reached. 
“As of right now, what the employer has put on the table is, in our opinion, unacceptable,” David said. “Employers [are] putting 30 cents per hour on the table which is, in all actuality, less than a 1% increase to our membership.”
According to David, many of the present custodial workers previously worked as direct USC employees, but the University laid them off 26 years ago. After two years, the workers formed a union and negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Since then, USC custodial staff members have worked under Aramark and remained on the University campus. However, because of this employer switch, workers lost USC-specific benefits.
“These workers lost their wages, they lost their healthcare,” David said. “They lost the right to be able to send their sons and daughters to this institution without any charge to tuition.”
Salvador Hernandez, who has worked as a custodian for nearly 32 years, said that, prior to the termination between USC and the custodial workers, employees received benefits such as discounts on the USC campus, transportation passes and tickets to sports games.
Manuela Flores, who has worked as a custodial worker for 22 years, expressed concern with the current conditions she and her colleagues face, and Aramark’s unwillingness to increase wages. 
“It’s frustrating,” Flores said in Spanish. “Twenty-two years and, at this point, feeling like this? It’s ridiculous.”
In addition to the union workers, some USC students joined the protest after hearing about it and left wondering how else they could support the cause. 
Delia Huerta, a senior majoring in art history, was interested in the protest as she views the custodial staff as essential to the community.
“They truly are the backbone of the University, and I don’t think they should be [reduced] to these unfair working conditions and unfair wages,” Delia said. 
Delia said she would be willing to join other efforts organized by the workers to help pursue efforts for higher wages and hopes others will get involved as well.
“Everybody else should get together and support these people because, without them, the University wouldn’t be what it is,” Delia said. “They truly do do everything for the University, so I think it’s really important to just come out and support them in any way that we can.”
Los Angeles mayoral candidate Kevin de León appeared at the demonstration in support of the custodial staff, addressing them prior to the start of the march. De León spoke about the significance of community for the workers and the importance of standing in solidarity.
“They’re part of our community here at USC,” De León said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They’re part of our Los Angeles community. They’re Angelenos themselves. So we need to express our voices and make sure they get what’s right.”
Organizers created a petition for the public to offer their support for the custodial workers, called the “USC Community Petition to Support Fair Wages for USC Janitors Employed by Aramark.” The petition invites community members to spread word of the negotiations and to join a Slack channel for updates about the cause. At the time of publication, the petition had garnered about 700 signatures. 
In a continuation of their efforts, the custodial workers will bargain at the Aramark office in Downtown L.A. Thursday.
Christina Chkarboul and Jenna Peterson contributed to this report.

When it comes to K-pop, no group can deliver a concept bursting with freshness like Red Velvet. From interviewing fruits to rapping with giant cats in the desert to “shooting bad boys down,” this group always delves fully into any concept while never losing their distinct voice and feel.
Their most recent comeback is proof that, even in their eighth year together, their ability to do something entirely new without ever sacrificing their musical prowess has not faltered in the slightest. In fact, they have constantly grown, both in artistic skill and their popularity in general, garnering more than 500,000 pre-orders for this mini-album — their largest number of sales yet — a feat accomplished by very few groups. Formed in 2014 with members Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, Joy and Yeri, Red Velvet, previously labeled as “Summer Queens” for their upbeat pop hits “Red Flavor” and “Power Up,” is on its way to conquer all the seasons with this latest installment of the ReVe Festival series beginning with spring. 
Their title track “Feel My Rhythm” opens with a sample of Bach’s “Air on a G String” yet soon flips on its sonical head in classic Red Velvet fashion as the song becomes a loud, fun, electronic combination of strings over computerized synths. Very few could make such a combination work, but the group executes it flawlessly, all while remaining true to their own distinct sound and musical flavor. 
Yeri’s ability to ride a beat, Wendy’s heavenly vocals and ad-libs and a music video drawing even more inspiration from classics, such as shots referencing Monet and Hieronymous Bosch, all feel so perfectly on brand and recognizable to the group’s own style. Joy’s “Red Velvet” call-out at the start of the song even appears more as a high-five to fans rather than any sort of needed reminder to the artists behind the track. 
After the title track, “Rainbow Halo” includes 808s and a snare beat flow that perfectly follows “Feel My Rhythm.” Despite its presence on a dance track, the warm song, underscored by its saxophone and layered harmonies, continues to showcase the group’s vocals.
The album’s shining moment, which feels more like a gritty neon-lit club rather than the springtime sun, is “Beg For Me.” Lead vocalist Seulgi’s equally gorgeous lower and higher voice are definitely the brightest they’ve ever been. Her whimsical tone, which dazzles on each and every track, is a large reason for the album’s greatness. But this harsh, bass-heavy song seems like it was produced specifically with her sultry sound in mind. Singing “Dance for me / Work for me / Beg for me,” by the end of the track, Red Velvet will have anyone listening on their knees. 
Immediately after is the track “BAMBOLEO;” drum beats over layered synths, transporting the group directly back into vivid spring and an overall glistening city pop track that feels like driving down a highway in 1980s Japan. Joy’s opening, “To the left to right, I sway all night / To the left to right, I feel the vibe / To the left to right, I come alive,” sparkles as her voice does throughout the entire track. A strong electric guitar riff and the group’s honey vocals feel airy and fresh, perfectly encapsulating the glittering feeling of daytime in spring, easily making it the strongest song on the album.
“Good, Bad, Ugly” features the quintet singing over an old-school R&B-inspired track and, while it is not as standout as the other tracks on the album, lacks by no means. It’s easy to listen to, with smooth melodies and wonderful lyrics about self-acceptance. It captures all the good, bad and ugly life likes to give, ending with the lyrics “Every day I just love me / Yeah, life is like a box of chocolates.”
Finally, what is probably Red Velvet’s best album close to date, “In My Dreams” serves as a beautifully haunting end to the first installment of Red Velvet’s 2022 story. The members build up the song with each verse in a spinning way, similar to how the song begins by mimicking the sound of a music box. Irene’s lower register sounds better than it ever has, and her “In my dreams, you love me back” sets the stage best for the almost cinematic climax that is the chorus of the song. The song is a perfect ending to the album, yet its closing leaves you wanting just a bit more, not wanting to leave the blooming, pastel-colored springtime fairytale ride just yet.
Red Velvet takes their place back on the throne with what is probably their strongest mini album to date, reminding the world that they are the queens of K-pop. They do it the way Red Velvet does best — fun, quirky and with a dedication to concepts seen in their music video to their talent in the recording studio that will convince anyone they’re actual royalty. This sonically cohesive masterwork of vocals proves their reign is far from over.

Content Warning: This column contains references to mental illness.
Hi, it’s me, “I tapped on your window on your darkest night.” If you look at my Spotify, deep in my playlists, you’ll find one named “Mentally Ill Swifties,” an homage to Taylor Swift’s commentary on mental illness.
One aspect of Swift’s “folklore” and “evermore” era that I’ve appreciated is the way she doesn’t shy away from talking about mental health. The era includes tracks such as “champagne problems,” which talks about a woman who is too engrossed in her own mental health journey to commit to her partner, “this is me trying,” which deals with serious issues, such as depression, suicide and substance abuse, and — my personal favorite — “hoax,” with the beautiful quote “Stood on a cliffside screaming ‘Give me a reason.’”
It’s dark, I know. I’m not here to talk about every little reference to mental health Swift makes in her music; instead, I want to analyze how it reflects her journey with mental health and how she comes to accept that she deserves love. 
Welcome back to “Fan-them Diaries.” I promise I won’t only write about Taylor Swift, but it’s just been one of those weeks. I need to take a look at my own mental health journey, and what better way to do that than through music? 
Swift’s “folklore” took everyone by surprise with its sudden release in fall 2020. It also took us on a journey of storytelling with the Betty-James-Augustine affair that spans across multiple songs. The album also showcased a raw side of Swift that dealt with deeper themes of mental illness and the struggle for self-acceptance. 
In comes the song “peace.” 
This song follows a narrator — presumably inspired by Swift’s own voice — attempting to explain to their lover how their relationship will persist despite the hardship of being in the spotlight and dealing with mental illnesses. “I’d give you my sunshine, give you best / But the rain is always gonna come if you’re standin[g] with me,” she sings.
In relation to Swift’s life, this song parallels her struggle with scrutiny over her very public relationships. It reveals that her relationship with Joe Alwyn changed her perspective on what love should look like — in her own words, “it’s golden.” 
But, for the audience, many (including myself) saw a double meaning to the lyrics: “feeling like a burden.” It’s something that people who struggle with these circumstances sometimes feel in relationships. I talk to my therapist a lot about feeling like a burden on friends because I get anxiety attacks at parties with large crowds or mute all notifications for a week straight because I don’t want to get out of bed. This feeling of burdening others is perfectly explained by “peace” and made me, for the first time, feel at peace with my mental illness. 
The beauty of “peace” doesn’t stop there. Listening to my aforementioned “Mentally Ill Swifties” playlist on shuffle one day, I heard “peace,” and the song which followed, “Renegade” by Big Red Machine featuring Swift, brought upon an epiphany.
The song acts as the other half of “peace” by reexamining reflections on mental illness from a new perspective.
“Renegade” could be interpreted as the experience of someone who loves a person with a mental illness and how it leads them to doubt their relationship: “is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?”
The singer contemplates insecurity, asking whether their partner’s mental illness stops them from fully committing. By its end, the song illustrates the message of accepting a person for who they are and wanting to help them in any capacity they can.
These two songs talk about the same issue from two different perspectives — the doubt and strain that mental illness can put in the way of accepting love. On both ends, the reality of mental illness can be a complicated journey for a person who feels that being themself is a burden.
The biggest takeaway from these two songs is the idea of acceptance. 
Swift showcases that everyone is deserving of love and that it is possible despite all of the obstacles one may face. Her songs bring me peace — knowing that one day I can find that acceptance within myself and live semihappily with my mental illness. 
From me and my “Mentally Ill Swifties” playlist (loving and accepting you in every way), 
Myriam.

“We don’t want you anymore.”
Five words no one wants to hear in any situation, especially when you’re let go from your student teaching position months away from your college graduation. 
That is exactly what happened to TikToker Mei Mei (@meimonsta) after the school she was working at dress-coded her countless times for her outfits.
Mei Mei needed to continue student-teaching to graduate from college at the end of this school year. Now she is left to wonder if her school will award her a degree after her four years of hard work. 
From an outsider’s perspective, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with her outfits. The clothes she wore were more professional and put together than most elementary or middle school teachers I have seen. 
Mei Mei’s situation is one of many issues teachers have turned to TikTok to share. “TeacherTok,” as the teaching community likes to call it, has amassed 2.2B hashtag views on TikTok. 
Under #teachertok you can find anything from funny classroom stories to teaching resources. More importantly, though, these teachers have found TikTok to be a place where they can raise awareness about inequitable issues, such as Mei Mei’s, that are occurring at schools and a supportive community to express themselves. 
Teachers from this TikTok community also didn’t think any of Mei Mei’s outfits were a problem. Carrie Hoffman @curhoff, a teacher from Kansas, not only agreed that her clothes were extremely professional but also admitted that Mei Mei looked better than her most mornings. She also shared a very insightful perspective about teacher expectations.
“Truly the last thing we should be worrying about is what we’re wearing,” Hoffman said. “Yet, this is what schools are going to pick on teachers about, what they can and cannot wear. Obviously, there is a line — I’m not saying there isn’t a line — but take something off of our plate.”
What is more important, the education of students or the clothes teachers wear while providing that education? I know I don’t remember anything my professors wear by the end of the day. If they wore something comfortable, it would not bother me; students come to class wearing pajamas half the time.
Cat Pullan (@catherinapullan) expressed her anger about the imposed anxiety of having to worry about one’s clothes while teaching.
“Now imagine being a student-teacher and getting dress-coded and made to feel guilty about something that you really did not mean to do,” Pullan said. “You think her lesson went as well as it would have if she didn’t get dress-coded? Do you really think her mind was 100% on the students? Absolutely not, and you can’t blame her, she was probably feeling self-conscious.”
To make matters worse, there has been little to no communication between Mei Mei and the school’s administrators. She was let go without warning or conversations about what the school expected from her. This demonstrates a larger failure on the part of the school’s expectations and rules.
Mei Mei’s experience highlights the institutional discrimination tied to dress codes. Dress codes have always been a misogynistic way to centralize the male gaze in public settings. I always remember hearing, “You have to cover your shoulders, avoid wearing tight shirts and make sure your skirt is not too short,” all because it “could distract the boys in the classroom.”
Comments and responses to @curhoff’s video highlighted some common double standards with dress codes among administrators.
”Most coaches get to wear sweats and a t-shirt but non-coaches are supposed to be dressed as ‘professionals,’” commented @jenniferwinchesterr.
Others expressed how heartbreaking it is to see a passionate teacher separated from students, especially as the United States experiences its current teacher shortage. 
Schools across the nation are experiencing a staffing crisis that was only exacerbated by the pandemic. Lack of classroom funding, little pay and minimal benefits have caused teachers to leave their positions. 
“It makes me so mad,” ​​@kaitlynhermansen said. “Teachers are so needed and admin and the politics of it make less teachers want to come or stay in the field.”
Right now, we need all the passionate teachers we can get. Issues as trivial as clothing should not be a barrier to genuine people like Mei Mei entering academia. Teachers’ dress codes should consider the best interests of teachers and students, not superficial administrators.
Dress codes don’t need to be abolished, but they need to be less detailed, nit-picky and misogynistic. Labeled dress codes, such as casual, business casual or business professional, would suffice and release educators from an anxiety which distracts them from their crucial responsibilities.

Content warning: This review discusses death by suicide and grief. This review contains spoilers for episode 1.
When a loved one dies, their family does not grieve alongside heart-wrenching music, nor do they see the world through dramatic wide-angle camera shots. In fact, it isn’t loud at all, and the world seems rather plain.
Although manifesting differently for everyone, grief is often silent and unrelenting. 
Hulu’s newest drama, “The Girl From Plainville,” released last Tuesday, beautifully displays the relentless isolation of grief. The show follows the Roy family as they grieve their son Conrad (Colton Ryan), who died by suicide and the subsequent investigation into Michelle Carter (Elle Fanning), the woman who encouraged him to take his own life. 
Based on a true story, the series details events in 2014, where Carter encouraged her alleged boyfriend, Conrad Roy Jr., to take his life. In a monumental case, Carter was later convicted of manslaughter. 
The premiere begins in the immediate aftermath of Roy Jr.’s death, starting with the Roy family’s desperate search for their son, culminating in the police finding his truck and body. Viewers are quickly introduced to Carter, a girl overcome by her grief for Conrad, yet no one in her family knows who Conrad is, and Conrad’s family has never heard her name. Carter is soon revealed to be reveling in Conrad’s death and works diligently to shift the focus off of him and his family and onto herself — his grieving girlfriend. 
Her narrative is manipulative and incredibly harmful. She inserts herself into the Roy family and forces them into the limelight, not allowing them to grieve in peace. 
At the end of the first episode, there is a shockingly haunting scene of Carter mimicking Lea Michele’s performance of “Make You Feel My Love” in the season 5 episode of “Glee,” “The Quarterback.” Carter wanted to be Lea Michele, the beautiful girlfriend thrust into the spotlight after her boyfriend’s death. However, Michele’s tears were real. Carter’s were not. 
This scene was particularly terrifying as Fanning perfectly displayed the merging of Carter’s fantasy (to be like Michele’s) and reality. Carter convinces herself that she is grieving and deserves the center of attention following Conrad’s death.
Frankly, it is impossible not to absolutely hate her and resist the desire to scream when she is on screen. However, the strong emotional reaction is because of Fanning’s impeccable acting. Fanning finds the reality Carter convinced herself she was in and dives deep into that headspace. 
Although Fanning is brilliant, the true standout is Chloë Sevigny, who depicts Lynn Roy, Conrad’s mom. Her performance is understated, quiet yet devastating. She does not rely on loud proclamations about her pain but instead on blank stares seemingly devoid of emotion except from her eyes, which elicit a deep and meaningful sadness. 
Sevigny’s depiction is accented by a remarkable sound department that knows when to stay quiet.
There is no dramatic background music attempting to get the audience to empathize with Lynn and the rest of the grieving Roy family. Instead, there is only haunting silence. 
The silence is incredibly deafening and adds to the seriousness of the situation. Silence makes their grief seem real because, after all, in real life, there is no soundtrack accompanying grief; there is just the unrelenting quiet and dark cloud of knowing more time passes since the loss of your loved one, stuck in the moment it happened. 
“The Girl from Plainville” is incredibly careful to display realistic grief in a story about death. Crime-based miniseries too often glorify the perpetrator while reducing the victim to a flat narrative. However, Carter is creepy and, to everyone’s relief, portrayed as the obviously guilty perpetrator in Conrad’s death. 
Lynn Roy even spoke about the family’s fear of this reduction prior to the release of the show, stating how she worried “there may be an attempt to defend some of her needless and evil actions.” The family spoke about their disappointment for not receiving a copy of the script and being forced to relive the loss of their son at the same time as the public, instead of beforehand and privately. 
The Roy family raises a good point. Why force their family to relive the loss of their son in the name of good television? There was no need to tell the Roy family story, especially when any detail about Conrad and Carter’s relationship came from Carter. Although Carter does not come off well in the miniseries, it validates and relies on her account of her and Conrad’s relationship and ends up casting her in the role she desired to play all along: Conrad’s girlfriend. 
Carter is the real winner of Hulu producing Conrad’s story, as she is the only person who desired the spotlight. Although a great effort, “The Girl from Plainville” forces the Roy family to relive a horrific time in their lives and make sure they never forget the name Michelle Carter.

College applications now feature more questions about overcoming adversity, encouraging students to write about adversity to showcase their grit.
One 2021-22 Common App essay prompt asks applicants to “recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure.” There is the common belief that admission officers love to read about adversity. However, there is a catch: Some hardships are more welcome than others. Or as I like to put it, some trauma sells better than others. 
As then high school senior Elijah Megginson wrote in a piece published in the New York Times: “I was told, ‘You’re smart and you’re from the hood, you’re from the projects, colleges will love you.’” In the article, Megginson wrote that he, and other Black African American students who wanted to apply to a predominantly white institution, felt like they were put in a box that is the cliché story of a Black kid in America. 
Aya M. Waller-Bey, a doctoral sociology candidate at the University of Michigan, found in her research that Black college students are aware of an expectation to write about trauma in college essays and find this expectation to be a racialized one. These stereotypes result in the phenomenon of marginalized students writing about their pain and white students discussing their passion. 
From a marginalized community myself, I also experienced the need to write a good sob story in my college application. However, not having the “typical” immigrant family experience — if such a thing even exists — I did not have any struggles that fit into any boxes. Something about searching for hardships to write about simply felt wrong to me because I never perceived myself as a victim. I felt like I was put at a disadvantage against my peers who had more or “better” adversity stories. I constantly thought: How can I oversell myself?
My experience reflects a widespread phenomenon rarely talked about: marginalized students attempting to become the poster child of trauma and pain. This phenomenon is equally problematic for both sides. For underserved students who feel expected to put dollar signs behind their trauma, they are pressured to reduce their identity to often negative stereotypes and reinforce narratives about them as victims. Those who get in by selling their trauma may also feel as though their college acceptance was undeserved and their trauma essay can become an internalized mindset they carry into their college experience.
For students who have undergone hardships in life that do not neatly fit neatly into any boxes or categories, they may find it more difficult to have their experiences understood or empathized with. The story of Mackenzie Fierceton provides one example.
Fierceton, a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania who won the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship in 2020, withdrew her Rhodes candidacy after Penn’s deputy provost Beth Winkelstein received tips that called into question the integrity of Fierceton’s scholarship application. In a letter to the Rhodes Trust, Winkelstein said Fierceton failed to “acknowledge her upper middle-class upbringing” and provided an inaccurate account of her abuse in her application. 
In an interview with Rachel Aviv, a writer at The New Yorker, Anne Norton, one of Fierceton’s friends, said, “I cannot avoid the sense that Mackenzie is being faulted for not having suffered enough. She was a foster child, but not for long enough. She is poor, but she has not been poor for long enough. She was abused, but there is not enough blood.” 
Who are we to judge if someone’s life is tragic “enough?” Who are we to validate someone’s victimhood? Do colleges really care about their students or do they simply want a sob story? Trauma, hardships and privilege are not tools we can use to measure a person’s worth. 
According to a 2018 Hechinger Report on race and college admissions, “Enrollment in the 468 best-funded and most selective four-year institutions is 75 percent white.” Research has repeatedly shown that white students, as a whole, have a higher chance of attending college due to their socioeconomic status. With this, students of marginalized backgrounds must do more than their white counterparts to stand a chance, even if it means trauma-baiting.
Although the college admission system is not going to change anytime soon, we can change how we view ourselves and others by not letting racial stereotypes factor in our judgment of others and practice a true embrace of diversity through appreciating the heterogeneity of individual experiences. Our struggles do not define us and we cannot let institutions, such as colleges, make us believe otherwise.

When I was a kid, my dad brought home a decades-old Volkswagen camper van in a color that could only be described as “hazardous material” green. My dad just may be the original #vanlife influencer, because our family beach days and camping trips in his repair-prone vehicle inspired me to search for one of my own. 
Unfortunately, these Volkswagens are known gas-guzzlers and  they aren’t sold new in the United States, so prices for these decades-old models are exorbitant. This past week, I heard some news that made my environmentalist heart soar — this year, Volkswagen will be coming out with an all-electric version of the classic microbus. 
Despite its inability to fit as many surfboards as I’d like, I have no hate for the very practical 2010 Toyota Camry that I bought last year. It’s no hippie microbus, and I have a mild heart palpitation whenever I see my total bill for a tank of gas these days, but nonetheless, I’m grateful for my fuel-efficient 32 highway MPG. 
Although gas prices had long been rising, the conflict in Ukraine has caused a phenomenon not unlike the pandemic toilet paper scramble. While the U.S. has its own fuel reserves, traders are willing to pay more for gas now on the off chance that they won’t be able to get it later. Experts also believe the demand for gas dropped during the pandemic, leading oil companies to produce less than their capacity, reminding us just how much power fossil fuel companies have over gas pricing. 
Many studies have shown that gas price spikes such as this correlate with renewed interest in electric vehicles. Now more than ever, it seems like electric vehicles are the way to go — drivers can avoid the fluctuations of the international oil market while doing something good for the planet. But is it ever really that simple?
The electric car market is slowly gaining traction across the world, as the number of electric cars, buses, vans and trucks on the road is expected to reach 145 million by 2030, but consumers are right to question its overall greenness.
Generally, experts agree that electric vehicles create a lower footprint over the course of their lifetime — from manufacture to scrap — than cars with traditional internal combustion engines, even in this transitional phase. Despite the comparatively clean-burning emissions of EVs, there are still some major downsides to consider before handing a significant chunk of your bank account to Elon Musk.
The most complex part of the EV supply chain is the production of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery needed for the car to run. Not only is creating batteries incredibly energy-intensive and carbon-emitting, it also requires the mining of rare raw materials. Increased demands for lithium has resulted in extreme environmental decimation, utilizing extractive and water-intensive practices to harvest vast quantities of the finite resource in places such as the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile. 
A study from the MIT Energy Initiative found that the battery and fuel production for an EV generates higher emissions than the manufacturing of a traditional automobile, but these costs are offset by an EV’s energy efficiency over time compared to a combustion engine. Additionally, in many parts of the world, coal and oil still power electricity grids. Unless your home is retrofitted with solar panels and a battery bank, odds are that the energy you’re using to charge your EV is coming from a nonrenewable source. It may be cheaper than the pricey fees you’re paying for gas these days, but electricity has a financial and environmental cost of its own.
All this is to say, although they’re marketed as a net-positive innovation, EVs present some major environmental trade-offs. However, with greater investment and stricter government regulation, we should expect more legitimately sustainable and affordable electric vehicles on the market in the next few decades. The world is on the precipice of a green transportation revolution and needs support to make it happen. Broader adaptation, more sustainable EV technology and greater infrastructural developments must occur simultaneously. 
The Biden Administration’s Build Back Better legislation theoretically uses policy to guide action — it includes measures that would incentivize buying EVs — but the proposal has yet to pass the Senate. To make EVs accessible to all, we need to address the price point, expand charging station availability and reassess the sustainability of materials. Above all else, we must successfully navigate the labyrinthine national power grid —  an incredibly arduous task, but without widespread clean energy, we’ll never achieve the full potential for electric vehicles. The sooner the better — my electric Volkswagen is waiting for me!

Under different circumstances, De’Anthony Melton would be considered one of the greatest Trojan basketball players of all time. 
His lone season at USC was a remarkable one. Melton was the first freshman to record at least 300 points, 150 rebounds, 100 assists, 60 steals and 35 blocks since Dwayne Wade. 
Even more impressive were his performances against NBA prospects. In one game, he put up 13 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 steals and a block in an 84-76 win over future No. 2 overall pick Lonzo Ball and UCLA. Against No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz, his numbers were even better — he posted 16 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 6 steals and 2 blocks versus the Huskies.
So, how did Melton go from putting up Dwayne Wade numbers and outshining the NBA’s top picks to becoming a second-round draft pick, largely forgotten by Trojan fans and ignored by fans of the NBA? 
One unfair suspension. 
Melton’s sophomore season was taken away from him without fanfare when his name became mixed up in a college basketball scandal. 
The scandal is an extremely complicated one, its most simplest terms, a family friend of Melton received compensation that wasn’t allowed by the NCAA rules at the time. 
This was, of course, before the emergence of NIL deals. 
What makes this whole situation odd is the fact that no evidence was ever found that Melton himself received any money, only that his relative did. Suspending Melton for someone else’s actions felt unfair then, and it feels even more unfair now that athletes can receive all the NIL money they want. 
Regardless, Melton didn’t play at all during the 2017-18 season. He missed any opportunity to boost his draft stock and was forced to spend a year without any in-game competition. 
His second round selection confirmed that no one thought of him as a future star anymore. 
Melton has since worked his way back from that low point. He has improved statistically every season since he was drafted, and after playing for a few different teams, he has found a home with the Memphis Grizzlies.
The Grizzlies have developed a reputation for two things: high effort and high level defense. Melton has always been an elite defender and a guy who will put in 110% effort for an open shot. He has embraced defense and effort more than ever with the Grizzlies, who have rewarded him handsomely. They signed him to a four-year contract in 2020.  
Despite his improvement, Melton still couldn’t inspire the same buzz about his potential that surrounded him during his freshman year at USC. 
Until now. 
In his last five games, Melton has averaged 20.6 points per game. This has greatly helped the Grizzlies who haven’t missed a beat in the recent absence of superstar guard Ja Morant. This hot streak culminated in a poster dunk over Kevon Looney that was on every highlight reel at the end of a night when the Grizzlies blew out the Warriors 123-95. 
 Speaking of the Warriors, perhaps Melton is the next Jordan Poole. Memphis has a crowded backcourt, but Melton fits his team’s identity and is thriving despite fierce competition for minutes. Poole has developed in similar fashion, playing well when given an opportunity on a Warriors roster loaded with guards. Both were second round draft picks who took a few years to develop but are emerging as perfect fits for their team. 
Many consider Poole a future star and the heir apparent to Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. If Melton continues to play well, the Grizzlies will be forced to give him more minutes too. 
If he does, it will be a credit to the years of working his way back from the threat of being forgotten. 
USC hoops fans, now is the time to jump on the De’Anthony Melton bandwagon. The only thing that should be forgotten about him is the scandal that stole his USC career. 
What we should remember is how excited everyone was about Melton during his freshman season, because he is beginning to put up similarly exciting performances for one of the best teams in the NBA. 
We were robbed of watching Melton ball out once. Let’s not let an opportunity to celebrate his exciting play slip through our grasp again.

As the NBA 2021-22 season nears its conclusion and franchises begin to look either towards the postseason or offseason, former Trojans have locked in and continued their consistent performances to support their respective teams. Production is coming from all around the league, as former USC stars and role players standout. 
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
Guard DeMar DeRozan’s career resurgence in the Windy City has permeated throughout the season, as the 13 year veteran has received nods for the Most Valuable Player Award. The former Trojan has averaged 27.7 points, 5 assists and 5.4 rebounds per game on 50.3% and 34.8% shooting from the field and beyond the arc, respectively. Barring any injuries, DeRozan is projected to surpass his career-best season tally of 2020 points managed in his 2016-17 season with the Toronto Raptors. 
Despite the Bulls’ recent tumultuous run and 4-6 record in the last ten games, DeRozan has remained the bedrock for Chicago’s playoff hopes. In the last three games, DeRozan has averaged 29.7 points, 6 rebounds and 4.3 assists. Chicago has yet to clinch a playoff spot, but with DeRozan’s continued efforts, the Bulls are poised to return to the playoffs after a five-year absence. 
Guard De’Anthony Melton, Memphis Grizzlies
With All-Star point guard Ja Morant missing time due to a tweaked knee, back-up point guard De’Anthony Melton has thrived in an increased role. In the last four games, the four-year Trojan has averaged 21.8 points and 4.8 rebounds per game, making 60% of his total shots and 59.5% of his 3-point attempts in only 22.9 minutes per game. 
Melton posted 19 points and 6 rebounds in just 21 minutes of action against the Indiana Pacers last Thursday en route to a 133-103 win that ultimately clinched the Grizzlies’ spot in the playoffs. With Morant still questionable for the foreseeable future, Melton’s efficient efforts off the bench will be crucial to guiding the team as Memphis enters the postseason. 
Guard Jordan McLaughlin, Minnesota Timberwolves 
With the Minnesota Timberwolves sitting firmly as the seventh seed in the Western Conference with a 43-33 record, 6.5 games ahead of the eighth seed Los Angeles Clippers, they now look towards their first playoff berth since 2018 through the play-in tournament. Despite only playing in limited minutes, guard Jordan McLaughlin has provided important contributions off the bench.
In the last three games, McLaughlin has averaged 8.7 points, 1.7 rebounds, 3 assists and 1 steal per game on 68.8% and 42.9% shooting from the field and 3-point line, respectively. In Minnesota’s convincing 116-95 win over the Dallas Mavericks Friday, the third-year guard notched 16 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists and a steal in 20 minutes of play. 
As the season nears its conclusion, the Timberwolves will continue to utilize their squad depth and bench versatility from the likes of McLaughlin to advance them throughout the playoffs. 
Power Forward Chimezie Metu, Sacramento Kings 
Although sitting 4.5 games behind the last play-in spot in the Western Conference with a 27-49 record, the Sacramento Kings have overseen development in their young squad. Fourth-year bigman Chimezie Metu is currently enjoying his best statistical season yet as he has seen an increase in points, rebounds and assists per game compared to last season. 
In the last three games, Metu has averaged 11 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.3 assists on 44.4% shooting from the field. In the Kings’ narrow 110-109 win over the Pacers, Metu provided 22 points, 5 rebounds, 1 steal and a block on 8-of-11 shooting from the field and knocked 3 of his 4 3-point attempts. As the Kings look towards next season, Metu’s performances off the bench give the team a chance at the postseason.

After a pair of conference victories, men’s tennis will head to the Pacific Northwest for another weekend of Pac-12 competition. The team will hit the road this week heading north to take on Oregon and Washington.
Last weekend, USC rose to 3-1 in conference play with victories over Stanford and Cal, bumping them up to No. 13 in ITA’s most recent rankings. Junior Stefan Dostanic led the Trojans once again, going 2-0 in both singles and doubles play on the weekend. His victories included an upset over the nation’s second-best player, Stanford sophomore Arthur Fery.
Friday’s rubber match with Stanford saw another close finish for the Trojans as they squeaked by with a 4-3 victory. Dostanic and senior Bradley Frye led the team to the doubles point, taking down the No. 48 doubles pair of Fery and fifth-year Axel Geller. Freshman Ryan Colby sealed the deal in a thrilling two-tiebreaker match on court four to defeat Stanford senior Alexandre Rotsaert.
Saturday against Cal was more of the same, with Frye wrapping the match up at 4-2 in a thrilling three-set tiebreaker. The Trojans have struggled in both three-set matches and clinchers this season, and Head Coach Brett Masi said the wins were welcomed.
“It felt amazing,” Masi said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Not only did [Frye] win a three-set match, but he helped clinch a match for this team, and we’ve struggled with that.”
The trip north to face Oregon and Washington presents a new challenge for a group that hasn’t left Southern California in more than a month.
“You’re on the road — you’ve got to be on high alert,” Masi said. “You can’t have those slip-ups and hope to hold on.”
The Trojans’ first stop will be in Eugene to face Oregon Friday. The Ducks have a formidable opponent for USC’s pair of Dostanic and Frye with the No. 25 ranked doubles pair of junior Joshua Charlton and freshman Quinn Vandecasteele. Oregon comes into the match off of a week of rest following a 4-0 loss to Utah.
“[Oregon] went on the road and they lost in a tough environment, being at altitude in Utah. That’s not an easy place to play,” Masi said. “So we have to look at the reverse effect as, okay, this team might be a little bit down, if we can jump on top of them, maybe they’ll kind of go away, if you will.”
The team will then head to Seattle to face Washington Sunday. The Huskies currently have the same record as the Trojans at 13-5, but with seven clean-sweep victories. 
Washington will also provide a challenge for USC’s Dostanic with No. 4 ranked junior Clement Chidekh. The Trojans have relied on Dostanic’s singles performances throughout the season, which Masi said he hopes to change to claim victory over Washington.
“When you have a kid like [Dostanic] playing one, you feel pretty good about going out there and you have a point on the board, maybe sometimes starting the match against most teams,” Masi said. “We have to rely on someone other than [Dostanic] to come through for us as well, because there’s no guarantee, you’re playing the number four guy in the country.”
Masi said he hopes that the Trojans can put an end to their string of close finishes this weekend with confident and aggressive play.
“We can’t just be letting our foot off the gas and letting [opponents] back into matches,” Masi said. “Just come out and play an aggressive style.”
The Trojans will take on the Ducks at 1:30 p.m. Friday in Eugene, and will then face the Huskies in Seattle Sunday at noon.
