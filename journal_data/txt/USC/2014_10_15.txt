Growing up, there were always a few CDs I could fall back on when the radio failed me. Among the collection was Yellowcard’s major-label debut Ocean Avenue, which was the soundtrack to my summers and a must on any road trip. The band’s blend of classical violin and surf rock had a huge influence on my music taste as I grew up. Eleven years later, Yellowcard is still making music, and their newest album Lift A Sail is bringing new life to the unique style they invented.
Something old, something new · The band has added ethereal tones, synths and a wealth of life experience to their old mix of simple gutar riffs, strong drums, punky vocals and a violin. This has created a more refined, mature sound in Lift a Sail, the band’s ninth studio album. — Photo courtesy of Razor & Tie
Lift A Sail still has remnants of Yellowcard’s old style from Ocean Avenue. Strong drums and simple guitar riffs paired with beautiful violin tracks and punky vocals are present, but the mood has shifted, signaling to the band’s growth. In addition to the older sounds of violin and guitar, Yellowcard also contributes ethereal tones and synths that give the new album a much darker attitude. The evolution of their music has resulted in a much more refined sound.
Over the last few years, the band was hit with a slew of tragedies: violinist Sean Mackin was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and lead singer Ryan Key’s wife was paralyzed in a snowboarding accident since the release of their album Southern Air. With the band’s experiences, it is no wonder this most recent effort is more brooding than anything Yellowcard has put out before.
Lift A Sail is composed of punchy rocks songs reminiscent of an earlier Yellowcard paired with ballads about love and loss. The powerful “Crash The Gates” that is in the first half of the album is in stark contrast to the album’s closer, “California,” a slow, piano-backed piece on love in dark times.
“When everything that I can see/ goes dark I feel you here with me/ and I, I’m holding on to you,” sings Key.
Hardship is a huge theme in the band’s ninth studio album, but as shown in lead vocalist Ryan Key’s lyrics, there is also a lot of hope. Lift A Sail, according to Key in an interview with OC Weekly, is about moving forward.
“I felt like the words ‘lift a sail’ invoke such a powerful emotion and hopeful feeling,” he said “We’ve always had that with our music, and the idea of lifting and moving forward was exactly what we wanted to convey.”
The themes of Lift A Sail are mature compared to their most prominent album Ocean Avenue, and this Yellowcard feels both familiar and wholly new. Lyrics are heavier and more meaningful. Instead of singing about days by the beach, the new album focuses on loss and fighting on. Lift A Sail’s title track is a song of adaptation and survival from sadness.
“If a cold wind starts to rise/ I am ready now, I am ready now./ With the last sail lifted high/ I am ready now, I am ready now.”
After everything this band has been through, from the two tragedies to the departure of drummer Longineu Parsons, it is inspiring to see so much hope in the band’s work. There has only been one music video for a track on Lift A Sail, and the direction the band took with the video furthers the inspiration. Shot in central Africa, the video is both a love story and an awareness video for the organization Invisible Children. It features real footage of child soldiers defecting, as well as a story about a boy who was taken from his love to join the army of child soldiers. Always hopeful, Yellowcard’s choice to make their video more than just an art piece shows a true commitment to growth and change, which also happen to be the backbone of the album.
“My Mountain,” a track near the end of the album, talks about the past and moving forward. As Key’s wife was paralyzed snowboarding, the mountain imagery clearly conjures negative thoughts for the lyricist, but he owns it and finds hope in the image.
“I have found my mountain/ I can be with her/ When I finally came across, I recovered all I lost.”
Key’s lyrics over a quick, syncopated guitar riff and heavy drums make this song a strong contender for the best track on the album, but there are a lot of gems to be discovered. Ultimately, the only real issue with this album is the similarity of the songs. This is not a huge problem, as the sound Yellowcard has crafted for Lift A Sail is fresh and clean, but it would be nice to throw in a lighter track or two to even out the darkness present in most of the songs.
Yellowcard is still making music, and although they have matured since their days of chasing girls and beach cities, their artistry still shines through. Lift A Sail is a testament to finding hope in dark times, and if you are ever in need of a good pick-me-up, look no further.

Mornings should not be taken lightly in a bustling city such as Los Angeles. Coffee should be single-sourced, grown ethically and piping hot. Pastries should be gluten-free, stuffed with locally grown fruits and baked fresh. Field Trip, an adorable new breakfast through lunch spot (they will begin serving dinner later this month) in Hollywood, serves up all of these on a slightly peculiar menu — Asian with an Amish twist.
Can’t hardly wait · Located in the Hollywood Farmers Market, Field Trip requires a long stay in line but its innovative flavor is worth the wait. – Photo courtesy of Field Trip
 
Head chefs Minh Phan and Sarah Lange boast an impressive résumé, including L.A. favorites Gaji, Beachwood Café, Hart & the Hunter and Flores & the Ladies Gunboat Society. Together they marry the traditional American breakfast with that from East Asia.
Located in the old Farmer’s Kitchen at the Hollywood Farmers Market, Field Trip is right in the center of Los Angeles’ hustle and bustle. Inside, the décor is sparse but trendy, with lots of natural light. The vibe inside Field Trip is a little industrial, with metal tables and sturdy wooden chairs — which makes it a bit uncomfortable. Diners soon get the vibe that this is a no-nonsense, chic L.A. eatery boasting locally grown ingredients and seats that don’t really let them slouch.
Field Trip isn’t a “sit down and get served” restaurant. Patrons stand in line behind a dozen other hungry and cranky non-morning people just to try the inventive menu. What the service staff lacks in tableside service, however, they make up for with friendliness and helpfulness at the register. With precise information on how the food is prepared and great recommendations on the most complementary flavors on the menu, the staff plays an important role in the dining and coffee drinking experience.
After ordering, customers might be hard-pressed to find a table, but with some luck one will open up by the massive windows, and they’ll be able to enjoy rare moments of morning sun without any L.A. smog.
Predominantly a breakfast place, Field Trip is truly creative when it comes to putting a spin on both Amish and Asian dishes. Customers have the option to taste a variety of different flavors on the menu since the plates are small and sharing is encouraged.
In addition to imaginative breakfast foods, the lunch items on the menu do not disappoint. Hearty options like smoked sesame chicken banh mi with salad or short rib sandwich with salad will fill up even the hungriest farmer’s market shopper.
The menu is divided up into brunch served all day and lunch beginning at 11 a.m. Ranging from $4 to $15, the menu is not overpriced, and while banh mi enthusiasts may scoff at a $14 version of the classic Vietnamese sandwich, it is worth the extra money if authentic banh mi joints aren’t close by. The frittata with underwood summer squash and roasted suncoast tomatoes is rich, full of flavor and artfully decorated, served with a side of salad.
If customers are not in the mood for protein, Field Trip offers amazing, fluffy and decadent seasonal pancakes ($10) that melt in the mouth. Paired with raspberry-geranium and whipped crème fraiche, the only thing mildly health-redeeming about this choice is that all of the ingredients are locally sourced and farmers market-procured.
Since dishes are to be shared, customers should feel free to order a mini feast. The condensed milk yogurt, granola and KnK ranch fruits ($9) put a delightfully Asian spin on classic yogurt and granola. Pro-tip: condensed milk is a commonly used ingredient in East Asian sweets, like, for example, in Vietnamese Coffee.
For just $13 the crispy rice and eggs meurette wowed the entire table. The dish is the epitome of what Field Trip is trying to accomplish. It happily marries the Western and Eastern hemispheres in an exciting amalgam of delicious textures, flavors and presented with an artistic flair that is irresistible in photos.
The menu at Field Trip boasts no weak spot. Everything from the fresh-brewed Verve coffee to the pastries is imaginative delicious. Since the menu is so affordable, there is no excuse to not grab even the smallest scone and coffee, adorably dubbed the Farmer’s Nosh ($4) when hanging out in Hollywood.
A meal for five, including three coffees, can end up costing only around $55. The food is delicious and the ingredients are fresh. Though Field Trip may be out of the way for many USC students, it is a great choice for special mornings or for those willing to brave the traffic just for a spin on coffee, eggs and inventive  sandwiches.

It is hard to choose which dream becoming a reality would be better — your first feature film or finally telling the world your story. For director Darius Clark Monroe, it is not a choice. His film, Evolution of a Criminal, is not only Monroe’s feature-length directorial debut, but also his chance to finally explain how — and why — he robbed a bank. The film premiered at SXSW in 2014 and was an official selection at the LA Film Festival this year. It went on to win the Grand Jury Prize and the Reva and David Logan Grand Jury Award at Full Frame, and the award for Best Documentary at Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival.
Evolution of a Criminal aims to explain the complexity and reality of life as a criminal. Monroe goes back to his hometown to interview his family, friends and victims of the robbery. Though we might expect a film whose director and subject are one and the same to be an attempt at justifying his actions, what we get is much more raw and honest. Monroe asks the questions, but he does no prompting. The movie is a mixture of interviews, narrations by Monroe and reenactments of the crime. It begins with a slow roll out of witnesses, then a reenactment of his arrest and works backward, working up to to his decision.
Monroe grew up in an extended family not only united by blood, but by poverty and strife. After his family was robbed, their suffering became crippling until Monroe decided to do something about it.
At the age of 16, he and two other companions, Trei and Pierre, decide to rob a branch of Bank of America. Monroe puts all of the money in a shoebox and gives it to his mother.
After the initial hysteria and shock from discovering her son had committed a crime, his mother uses the money to pay bills and take care of other family members. But eventually, the crime catches up to them and Monroe is tried as an adult and sentenced to five years in prison.
Evolution of a Criminal deals with hope in dark situations and second chances, but it is not naïve. Monroe includes an interview with the prosecutor of his case, who tells him she is still skeptical that he has truly changed, despite it having been over 15 years with no relapses. He also includes a scene where he attempts to talk with a victim of the robbery who refuses to accept his apology or forgive him.
In the Q&A following the screening Monroe mentions several others who would not even agree to be in his film. Monroe makes no attempt to hide his flaws. Instead, he embraces them, and ends the film with an interview with his uncle, who has also gone to jail. His uncle talks about how he wasn’t born to be a convict, but “he had a conviction.” Monroe’s uncle contends that if he had let himself stick with the mentality of being a convict, that’s all he ever could have been, but he chose instead to rise above it.
This message applies to no one better than the director himself. After being convicted, Monroe served his time and earned his G.E.D. in prison. He then went on to study film at NYU before producing several short films. But the movie shows far more than just Monroe’s personal evolution. From victims to family members, the film depicts the impact his actions had on others. It is not Monroe’s story as much as it is a story about growth and dynamics. His family is depicted as having loved, lost and yearned for him throughout his imprisonment. His victims are people who have gone through stages of acceptance, from anger and resentment to, sometimes, learning to forgive.
This movie stands out against other documentaries as it’s not just a fascinating story of a criminal with good intentions, but also the story of those he impacted and their evolution from anger and resentment to acceptance or, in the case of his family, from fear for his safety to joy at his return. It moves beyond a film that changes perspectives, and instead aims to challenge outlooks permanently.
Evolution of a Criminal is not a run-of-the-mill documentary on a world most rarely see. This documentary is about a world we all see every day and while the subject matter is more potent and new to most, it still boils down to the fact that destiny is made and second chances always exist for those who fight.

On Oct. 16 at 10:16 a.m., millions of people in California are expected to participate in an annual earthquake drill called the 2014 Great California ShakeOut.
Shake it off · Jason Ballman, communications specialist at the Southern California Earthquake Center, poses in front of the center. The SCEC aims to expand the ShakeOut region to Texas and Nebraska by next year. – Michelle Wolzinger | Daily Trojan
 
The ShakeOut takes place a day before the 25th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake, a 6.9 magnitude quake that hit the Bay Area in 1989.
USC started doing the Trojan ShakeOut in 2008, which was also the first year Southern California started participating in the Great California ShakeOut. USC was among the first universities to participate. The program has since grown beyond California to countries around the world.
The Trojan ShakeOut Drill will be led by the Southern California Earthquake Center, which is headquartered at USC. This drill is meant to promote awareness about what is safe to do before, during and after an earthquake.
All students, faculty and staff are encouraged to practice “Drop, Cover, and Hold On” for one minute in all buildings on campus and then wait for a minute as if prepping for an aftershock.  In addition to the “Drop, Cover, and Hold On” drill, the response capabilities of all departments and schools will be tested. The Trojan ShakeOut Ambassadors, a team of students publicizing the ShakeOut, are sharing earthquake preparation tips and facilitating the drill in all campus buildings.
“Earthquakes are a natural disaster that can occur here in Southern California, and [the ShakeOut] is a great way to educate and remind people who live here what to do when an earthquake occurs,” said Steve Goldfarb, fire safety and emergency planning specialist at the USC Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning.
Goldfarb said that USC has taken extensive measures to prepare for all types of emergencies and disasters. Highlights include plans for disaster medical response.
The campus emergency response team consists of about 325 staff and faculty members who are trained for search and rescue, fire suppression and other emergency response skills. USC has emergency food supplies, water filtration systems, satellite communication and amateur radio capabilities. There are also teams that do post-earthquake building damage assessment.
Jason Ballman, communications specialist at SCEC, said that the expansion of the Great California ShakeOut program, is an ongoing effort. The SCEC works with regional coordinators, attempting to expand to different earthquake-prone areas of the United States and other countries around the world. Ballman said that for next year, they are trying to gain official ShakeOut regions in Texas and Nebraska.
“Here at USC, we’re smack dab in the middle of earthquake country near a fault that could produce the most damaging earthquake in Southern California,” Ballman said. “People need to know how to protect themselves during an earthquake, as well as secure their space and prepare before.”

The USC Center on Public Diplomacy hosted United States Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel on Wednesday at a forum discussion on the complexities surrounding public diplomacy in a hyper-connected world. The discussion, “Why We Need to Harden Our Soft Power,” was live-streamed online from Wallis Annenberg Hall.
Mr. Secretary · Richard Stengel, the United States Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, discussed U.S. policy on Wednesday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“Soft power is the communications between people about policy,” said Stengel, a Princeton graduate and Rhodes Scholar. “From a government perspective, it’s about putting people and policy together.”
The Under Secretary, a former managing editor of TIME.com, joined the U.S. Department of State last February to provide global strategic leadership for all Department of State public diplomacy and public affairs engagement work, focusing specifically on propaganda from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria — more commonly known as ISIS or ISIL — and Russia. Stengel discussed the impact that both ISIS and Russia are having on the cybersphere, spreading their message in a multitude of languages and using state-controlled news and entertainment programming to push their opinions onto the populace.
“Ninety percent of Russians get 100 percent of their news from state-controlled media,” Stengel said. “There was no answer from the U.S. government [to this information]. In this information environment where you are up against Russian propaganda and this nasty and violent ISIL propaganda, we have to contest the space.”
Stengel credits his journalism background for helping him see the media from a different perspective. He is trying to bring speed and efficiency to the government in their dissemination of information to the public.
“We have to do a better and more forceful job of getting our ideas out,” Stengel said. “We need to shape the response in real time. We can’t be on our back foot.”
Stengel said that though U.S. pop culture has been a huge factor in public diplomacy in the past, its influence has dropped given the rise of other countries’ involvement in the entertainment industry. As such, countries such as Russia and China have utilized their increased media presence to gain more autocratic control in their respective countries. Stengel recounted that a month into his position at the State Department, he witnessed the ramifications of such media involvement in the Russian annexation of Crimea.
“We saw the Russians in the social media space laying a predicate for their battleground in Crimea, all before they were actually in the kinetic battlefield,” Stengel said.
Though Stengel claims the government’s goal is to spread U.S. public policy, he differentiates that from the Russian and ISIS methods of spreading propaganda. Stengel explained that whereas the United States seeks to explain their own policy goals, Russian and ISIS’s propaganda methods attempt to disseminate a false perception of how things actually are.
“As there is a difference between flattery and honest praise, there’s a difference between propaganda and what our policy is,” Stengel said. “We are trying to tell people what our policy is, explaining what our policy is and having a conversation. It’s not about winning hearts and minds.”
Stengel stressed the importance of third parties getting involved in spreading the message of U.S. policy and urged the next generation to be involved in this discussion.
“I don’t think it will be my generation that solves this problem,” Stengel said. “It will be this generation.”

USC launched a pilot crowdfunding program earlier this month for faculty, staff and students to fund their projects.
The program, dubbed Ignite USC, is a combination of the famed Trojan Family network and crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter. It aims to serve as a way for students and faculty to raise funding for meaningful projects that might not otherwise get exposure.

Donations to projects will be counted toward the university’s campaign to raise $6 billion in funds. Projects will receive 100 percent of donations earned.
“We liked that model, specifically for higher education,” said Tracey Vranich, vice president for advancement services at USC. She mentioned that companies like Kickstarter take a percent commission for services while Ignite USC eliminates that element.
“It’s a great way to get people involved in a grassroots sort of way,” she said.
The USC Provost’s office will be overseeing the site, and is currently testing the idea with two featured projects.
The first, Cardinal and Gold Goes Green, is an initiative to add to the number of water refueling stations around campus in an effort to reduce plastic water bottle usage. The second is  MED SRG, a non-profit that aims to ship excess surgical supplies to established nonprofits around the nation that perform surgeries in developing countries.
Both projects have already made headway towards their respective goals in the few days since Ignite USC’s launch.
MED SRG founders and 2014 USC graduates Chris Shafer and Anish Parekh are both excited about the new initiative, saying it is integral to the young nonprofit’s future success. Their company specifically aims to help nonprofits that work internationally in places where medical supplies are incredibly rare.
“We’re putting our heart and soul into this campaign, and we really hope the Trojan Family is going to recognize both the program and our project,” Shafer said.
MED SRG already has an administrative and logistical framework, and the co-founding pair hope to begin the practical aspect of collecting boxes and shipping supplies with the funding raised through Ignite USC.
Similarly, Cardinal and Gold Goes Green also has a framework in place aimed at their goal of reducing waste. Their project is backed by the USC Environmental Studies Program and the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies.
Michael Young is a part of the team for Cardinal and Gold Goes Green. He believes Ignite USC is a great way for the community to get involved.
“USC is a big enough community that we could have a serious impact,” he said. “I can see [Ignite USC] growing and creating lots of change on campus.”
Vranich said that the Provost’s office will be looking for compelling projects that have a direct tie to the university to feature on a potentially monthly basis. The success of the two current projects will inspire growth of the site.
Parekh believes that the site has potential to grow the USC community as well.
“On a larger scale, I think Ignite USC is really cool because it is going to concentrate the entrepreneurial spirit we have at USC, and create a community of startups,” Parekh said.

Former Trojan wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was back on campus Wednesday night to discuss his career path with students in Professor Jeff Fellenzer’s Sports, Business and Media in Today’s Society class.
Keys to success · Keyshawn Johnson, who played for the Trojans for two seasons and in the NFL for 11, spoke about his experiences in a wide variety of fields, including the restaurant business and real estate. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The outspoken 11-year NFL veteran spoke to students candidly about growing up in poverty and transforming himself to a successful businessman after retiring from the NFL in 2007.
“When you grew up the way I grew up, the only way that you could survive and get to a certain economic wealth was either through music, athletics or drugs,” Johnson said.
Johnson prepped at Dorsey High School in Los Angeles before heading to West L.A. College from 1992-1993. He transferred to USC in 1994 and hauled in 66 passes for 1,362 yards and nine touchdowns in his first year wearing cardinal and gold. Johnson was named the offensive MVP of the Cotton Bowl that year, in which the Trojans topped the Texas Tech Red Raiders, 55-14.
In 1995, Johnson caught 102 passes for 1,434 yards and finished seventh in Heisman voting. He set USC records at the time and was drafted No. 1 overall by the New York Jets in the 1996 NFL Draft.
Most players would humbly brush off accomplishments such as these, but Johnson is no ordinary personality.
“These shoes are hard to fill, man,” Johnson said.
USC has been trying to fill his shoes ever since he left, but Johnson said he was not overly pleased with the state of the Trojan football team today.
“I believe that we have the premier football program west of the Mississippi, by far,” Johnson said. “We should never be 4-2. We should never lose to Boston College. We should never lose to Washington State at home. Never. End of story.”
Johnson was also quick to criticize the current state of the NFL, which is in the midst of controversies over mishandling cases of domestic violence, child abuse and player safety.
“I think some of the problems that came up earlier in terms of the domestic violence stuff, it’s been going on for a long time in professional sports or in the NFL,” Johnson said. “But they have never really addressed it to the level they needed to … They’re in the business of making money.”
Students in the class were taken aback by how upfront Johnson was, considering that he is now a member of the media, frequently appearing on Sunday NFL Countdown on ESPN.
“I learned that he’s extremely honest and very pointed,” said Chris Lopez, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I expect from guys who I see in the media who talk a lot, like [Seahawks cornerback Richard] Sherman, that they don’t have the full perspective in mind, but I was surprised by how intelligent he was about all situations.”
Johnson had a lot to say about the relationship between athletes and the media, since he has had experiences in both fields. He recounted an incident when he was practicing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after being traded away from the Jets. He  flipped off a camera being operated by a friend of his, but a reporter took the footage back to the news station and spun a story about him being angry about playing his former team. Johnson told the aspiring sports journalists in the class that there are grave consequences to attempting to make up storylines that might not be true.
Some of the student-athletes in the class related to what the former Trojan had to say.
“My favorite part was how real he was — just the idea that he comes in here and says the truth,” said sophomore communication major Max Browne, the backup quarterback for USC’s football team. “He was a student-athlete here once upon a time, so he knows kind of what we’re going through to an extent. Obviously, he was a much bigger deal than anyone in this class, but it was nice hearing it how it is.”

As students transition from high school seniors to college freshmen, they are faced with several obstacles during their first semester: dining hall food, messy roommates, 8 a.m. Friday classes and the dreaded Writing 150 course.
The class is intended for freshmen to learn how to write at the college level. Unlike the previous freshman course Writing 140, Writing 150 is not attached to a General Education V category class to ensure that students would be able to write about topics they’re interested in. The course, however, still contains the same issues with teaching new writing techniques effectively.
By making Writing 150 a pass/no pass class, students would have the opportunity to transition from writing the static, typical five-paragraph expository essay to the research-oriented paper without worrying about their GPAs. Additionally, students would focus more on the feedback and comments from work throughout the year in order to improve their writing for themselves, rather than simply aiming for a high letter grade.
Though some argue that a pass/no pass class would limit a student’s full potential, the passing grade requirement would ensure that students would still work hard for the class.
Throughout high school, students are drilled with the idea of a perfect five-paragraph essay. This writing style is taught with an extremely detailed outline of what is expected within the paper. By the time freshmen arrive at USC, they have perfected the mechanics of the five-paragraph essay. Despite this, they are expected to write lengthy research papers for their Writing 150 class and somehow succeed. Because the writing style is completely new, many are shocked and saddened when they discover they received a poor grade on the first paper, as for many of them it is their first grade in college. After receiving a poor grade, freshmen might lose confidence in their writing skills. Students deserve the time to develop their own writing without the constant fear of hurting their GPA.
If they’re assessed solely on a pass/no pass scale, students would be able to view a graded paper with ease, as they could focus less on the grade and more on the comments and feedback. By focusing more on improvement for the sake of progress and not a grade, students might feel more motivated to edit and revise their work, ultimately improving their writing in the future.
Students should be free to experiment with their writing styles. If students are constantly trying to reach the standard of a typical “A” paper, they might never develop their own unique writing style and instead try to fit the mold of a typically successful paper. With a pass/no pass grade, students would be able to experiment in their work and eventually develop their own unique writing styles. This transitional period between the five-paragraph essay and the university level paper without the pressure of a letter grade would provide students more insight into their work without incentivizing a cookie-cutter writing format.
With the stress that comes with adjusting to a new environment away from home, freshmen do not need the additional pressure of a letter grade in Writing 150. Writing 150 is not only one of the first classes that freshmen take, but also a new approach to writing that many students might not have had prior exposure to. Pass/no pass wil help make their first few semesters at USC more focused on how rich the learning process can be rather than the obsession over that coveted A.
So WRIT 150 replaced 140, right?
My take is that if
If a freshman can’t pass Writing 101 how the hell did they get into USC?  Oh, that’s right, football scholarship.
You’re missing a comma, spikey.  Oh, that’s right, bRuins suck balls.
Try again, not a bruin.
Not everyone who gets into SC is a football player.

This past Monday, the Vatican released a report midway through its two-week synod. At the assembly comprised of more than 200 bishops, priests and laypeople, Pope Francis discussed pressing social issues facing the Catholic Church, paying particular attention to the potential acceptance of the LGBT community. The deeply conservative and tradition-based Catholic Church has long ostracized and discriminated against homosexuals.In a large shift in tone that has been long overdue, the Pope Francis-led Vatican now looks to change that narrative and usher in an era of non-discrimination and acceptance among all.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
Since his appointment in March of 2013, Pope Francis has become a beam of new light for the Church. By rejecting the papal estate and steadfastly encouraging people to help the poor and disabled, Pope Francis has restored humility to a papal seat that many viewed was losing influence and potency. The Pope Francis era, in its brief start, marks a positive shift in tone and its position in the world.
The synod, in its preliminary report, urged the Church to recognize the value and qualities LGBT individuals bring to the community, a major departure from the centuries-old belief that they live in sin in the eyes of the Church. The progressive philosophy being adopted revolutionizes the way the Church treats its members and is a positive step forward in equality in the faith. Not only has the synod debated acceptance of gays, but it has also contemplated the giving of communion to couples who divorced without the consent of the Church and remarried. A largely contentious topic, the Church traditionally has adopted a normative tone concerning divorce, decreeing marriage as final and divorce anathema to dogma. With a more compassionate tone, the Church is increasingly becoming more accepting of groups and minorities who have traditionally been rejected by the Church. In an institution that predicates itself on acceptance by God of those who have been rejected by society, it is a glowing relief that the Church has shifted its tone in beginning to accept gays and other groups facing discrimination. With the LGBT community becoming more and more accepted in mainstream society, the Church faces a crossroads in choosing which side of history to be on. In the United States and across the world, gays and divorcees are often kicked out of parishes, unfairly treated and wholly rejected by their communities simply because of their sexual orientation or marital status. The Church is in need of reform, and this week’s synod council is a positive step forward in fomenting change. Many have called the spirit in this council similar to that in the Second Vatican Council held over 50 years ago, which dramatically changed the way the Church performs mass and its relationship with the masses.
Not all bishops and priests are on board with Pope Francis’ progressive views. Many conservatives strongly voiced their opposition, arguing that the Church does not adapt to its members. The Church establishes itself as the beacon of morality and source of truth, and its positions should not bend to the times. As many traditional Christians believe, the Church is not democratic. That is to say, it does not evolve and change with the will of the people — rather, the people mold to the teachings of the Church. The traditional stance taken by these bishops, however, fails to recognize some of the most basic teachings of the Church, which preaches acceptance of all, despite your background.
The Church isn’t evolving. It’s staying true to its creed and beliefs that have long been lost in centuries of power struggle within the Church. In addition to his urging of openness in the Church, Pope Francis also supports the possibility of priests marrying. Conservative Catholics oppose the move, citing the centuries-old tradition of priests remaining celibate. Observers wielded the notion as another progressive reform promoted by the pope. Married priests are not new in the Church. The early Church allowed priests to marry until Pope Gregory VII banned their marriages as a way to consolidate power during the Middle Ages. The point being made is that the Church has shifted its stance before without outcry from tradition-focused members. The reforms being debated and urged by Pope Francis aren’t progressive agendas aimed to evolve the Church away from God; rather, they edify the Church and make it more open, accepting and welcoming to all.
Pope Francis has been able to restore the ethos of the Church through humility, acceptance and service. The way he’s leading in his nascent papacy is nothing but positive.

Athanasius,
All churches have a right to maintain their traditional stance on homosexual behavior.  It is not discrimination, it is their belief based on the Bible and it is considered sin.  It is stated very plainly.  As long as they receive no federal funds they cannot be bothered about it either.  There is no need for churches to evolve with the times and accept deviant lifestyles in society.  Folks can live as they choose, but they can’t expect people to welcome them with open arms in the churches of America.  If they do that then they might as well throw away the Bible and write a new book.  I guess you think religion should be some sort of free-for-all where it doesn’t matter how you live.  Just like the new transgender law in California public schools where the individual can choose whatever restroom they desire.  Total insanity!  The political correctness garbage needs to stop as well as the catering to the LGBT agenda.  Granted we are human and nobody is perfect, but the object in church is to avoid sin not promote it and let folks think they have a license to live a way opposed to biblical views.  If the Catholic church wants to adopt progressive views it will be at its own peril.  Its just a reminder of the immoral times we live in today.

After fighting valiantly this weekend but coming away empty-handed against two of the top teams in the country, the USC women’s soccer team now looks to rebound this Friday against a tough competitor in Arizona State. The Women of Troy (8-4-2, 2-3-0 Pac-12) feel that this week’s matchup with the Sun Devils (8-2-4, 1-1-3) is a good opportunity to turn things around.
Tough job · Senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley will have to stop a strong ASU offensive attack, led by Aly Moon and Cali Farquharson. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“After the two losses this past weekend, we definitely want to come out and reestablish ourselves, especially considering that we only have one game this weekend,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine. “Because of that, we can focus a little more on going out and winning this game.”
Though the outcomes of the Stanford and Cal matchups didn’t fall in USC’s favor, McAlpine felt that the on-field performance of the team was strong.
“I felt our intensity was good this weekend, and for the most part we took care of the ball,” the first-year coach said. “However, we weren’t as good in the final third, and so our opponents were able to come back at us with counterattacks.”
Naturally, this week’s preparation for the Sun Devils has largely been structured with last weekend’s performance in mind, as the two games against top-notch talent revealed specific areas of the Women of Troy’s game that needed improvement. Specifically, the team has been working on improving its finishing around the net after the team managed just four shots-on-goal combined in the two weekend games.
“Practice this week has been about finding opportunities to get behind the defensive line more,” McAlpine said. “We need to find more opportunities in the final third to create more goal-scoring chances on frame, especially against well-organized teams that have scouted us well.”
On the list of well-organized teams is Arizona State, who will enter Friday’s matchup at McAlister Field as one of the Pac-12’s biggest mysteries. Though they have just one win in their previous five contests, the Sun Devils tied with No. 1 ranked UCLA on Sept. 26. Their only loss since August came this past Friday to No. 20 Washington, 2-1.
Midfielder Aly Moon (20 points thus far on 8 goals and 4 assists) and forward Cali Farquharson lead ASU’s attack. In order to cool off these two red-hot Sun Devils, the USC back line will have to be rock-solid.
“Arizona State has two great attacking personalities in Farquharson and Moon,” McAlpine said. “Slowing them down will be the most difficult aspect of playing ASU. However, if we can do that, we will have a great chance to win.”
The matchup kicks off at 2 p.m. on Friday at McAlister Field. The match is USC’s only one of the weekend.

Last week I documented the outright weirdness that has marked — or plagued, depending on where your loyalties lie — the 2014 Pac-12 football season thus far. This week, inspired by ESPN.com’s Kyle Bonagura, I decided to dive back into the fray and dole out some midseason awards. Along with the winners, I added some contenders that could take over the top spots by the season’s end.
Offensive MVP: QB Marcus Mariota (Oregon)
In a season that has defied any and all expectations, Mariota has been as advertised — and more. The redshirt junior still has yet to throw an interception and leads the Pac-12 in passing efficiency by over 20 points. Perhaps most impressively, Mariota has kept the Ducks’ offense firing on all cylinders behind an inexperienced, much-maligned offensive line. Now, with left tackle Jake Fisher back in the lineup, the conference’s top scoring offense could be more dangerous than ever.
In the running: TB Javorius “Buck” Allen (USC), QB Jared Goff (Cal), RB Paul Perkins (UCLA), WR Jaelen Strong (ASU)
Defensive MVP: LB Scooby Wright III (Arizona)
I firmly believe that USC junior defensive end Leonard Williams is the Pac-12’s best defensive player by a wide margin. Unfortunately, a combination of consistent double teams, nagging injuries and the real worry of risking a lucrative professional paycheck with a more serious injury has limited Williams’ production. I would never accuse the All-American of taking his foot off the gas until the NFL Draft comes around, as some did when South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney had a similarly disappointing junior season in 2013. Williams just isn’t that kind of player. But if it was true, could you really blame him?
On the other end of the spectrum is Arizona sophomore Scooby Wright III. The former two-star recruit, who has started for the Wildcats nearly his whole career, is playing like a man possessed this season. Though Wright only gained national attention for his game-ending strip sack of Mariota a few weeks ago, he has had the attention of Pac-12 offenses all year: his 70 total tackles lead the conference, while he ranks second in tackles for loss (11) and fourth in sacks (six).
In the running: Williams, LB Shaq Thompson (Washington), LB Eric Kendricks (UCLA)
Best Coach: Sonny Dykes (Cal)
Aside from a mystifying beatdown at the hands of Washington and a last-second loss to Arizona, Cal has been nothing but impressive this season. Goff has continued to grow as a quarterback, while the team’s other skill position players — namely at wide receiver and kick returner — have been equally excellent. Defense is an issue for the Bears, to be sure, but a team coming off of a 1-11 campaign has to have one weakness, right? I’m not sold on Dykes as a complete package, but he has done a commendable job inspiring faith in a group that went through one of the worst seasons in recent memory.
In the running: Rich Rodriguez (Arizona)
Biggest Surprise: Arizona
It wasn’t out of the realm of possibility at the beginning of the season to think Cal could get hot and rip off a few wins, especially with its offensive potential. The idea that Arizona, led by a freshman quarterback and without record-setting running back Ka’Deem Carey, would be undefeated in early October? That was out of the question. And yet, that’s exactly what happened. Quarterback Anu Solomon looks nothing like a freshman, Wright plays with no regard for human life, and the tandem of Nick Wilson and Terris Jones-Grigsby has been more than serviceable at running back. Whether the Wildcats continue their success or Saturday’s loss to USC signals a larger slide, it will be a season to remember in the desert.
In the running: Cal
Biggest disappointment: UCLA, Stanford
UCLA is the popular choice in this category, and for good reason. The Bruins limped to three non-conference wins before finally looking like the playoff-contender many predicted them to be in a 62-27 whipping of Arizona State on Sept. 25. Just as soon as the hype returned to Westwood, however, it disappeared again. A weak offensive line and an inconsistent defense doomed UCLA to consecutive tough losses against Utah and Oregon.
I added Stanford to this category not because the team has a signature bad loss, but because the Cardinal could so easily be undefeated. Three-point losses at the hands of USC and Notre Dame, both of which could have gone the other way, separate No. 23 Stanford from a prime spot in the playoff race. Instead, the Cardinal will have to fight for a third straight Pac-12 Championship Game appearance.
Best Eli Manning impression: QB Connor Halliday (Washington State)
Halliday put his own spin on the Manning face with a look of sheer incredulousness after his team fell to Cal 60-59 on a 19-yard missed field goal. The gunslinger threw for an NCAA-record 734 yards during the Oct. 4 game, and is averaging 477.7 passing yards per game so far this year. Someone donate that arm to science.
Best pun based on a game-ending play: The “Hill Mary,” Arizona vs. Cal
Question my objectivity all you want, but you have to take the “Hill Mary,” over the “Jael Mary.” Arizona’s Solomon connected with wide receiver Austin Hill to beat Cal a full two weeks before USC suffered a similar fate to Jaelen Strong and Arizona State. Be original, guys! And yes, as much as I enjoyed watching the “Shank-ron” on Saturday, it just doesn’t have the same ring to it. Come to think of it, I’m willing to bet this is a more competitive category than in past years.
Best sideline soap opera: Pat Haden vs. Pac-12 officials 
Again, a weirdly competitive category. Though I was thoroughly entertained by the spat between UCLA head coach Jim Mora and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich on Saturday, I have to give Haden the nod. I saw it with my own eyes, but I still can’t quite wrap my head around his mid-hot dog charge down from the Stanford press box to the sideline. Never change, Pat.
Worst timing for punt return practice: LB Hayes Pullard (USC)
No competition. No explanation.

Looking to avoid mistakes and remain atop the Pac-12 South rankings, the USC football team is approaching this weekend’s game against the Colorado Buffaloes as if it is a championship game.
Craving a win · Sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens has been a force for the Trojans at multiple positions, leading the team with 9.5 tackles for loss. Cravens knows that overlooking Colorado would be a mistake. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
A Championship a Week
A few crucial mistakes throughout the season have put the Trojans in a position where the only path to the NCAA playoff involves the difficult task of winning the rest of their games. This tall order has the team treating every game as if it is the last game of the season and embracing a championship mentality.
“[Head coach Steve Sarkisian] said it right after the Arizona game, next week’s another championship game,” sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “Colorado’s going to give us their best shot just like every other team that comes to the Coliseum. We have to be ready for the punches they’re going to throw.”
Sarkisian noted that practice on Wednesday was very positive and that he was pleased with the team’s attention to detail. He believes that the guys are starting to fully understand the routine of every week and that they are in a good frame of mind leading up to the Colorado game.
“We have a half-game lead in the conference and we need to keep that lead, and to do that, we have to go out and win every game,” Sarkisian said. “I’ve been using the same message I’ve been using since last week, this is a championship game. They all are from here on out.”
60 Minutes
One of the main problems that the Trojans have run into in the past couple of games is failing to play 100 percent for all four quarters. They have allowed fourth quarter comebacks in consecutive weeks, leading to a 1-1 record in those contests.
“We can’t let teams come back in the fourth quarter or let them build momentum in the second and third quarters,” Cravens said. “We have to finish, we have to learn how to finish. I’ve been saying that for the last three weeks; we have to finish when it matters.”
Cravens’ words were echoed by defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox, who added that the defense has to work on getting off the field and not allowing their opponents to convert on key plays that extend drives.
“You have to be able to play with a calm mind and trust your training, your instincts, your techniques and finish those plays,” Wilcox said. “You have to get off the field on third downs.”
Buck for Heisman?
After another impressive performance in a win against the Arizona Wildcats, redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen has put himself into the Heisman Trophy conversation. Allen tied for sixth in a weekly straw poll conducted by HeismanPundit.com. He also received the honor of being named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.
Though USC has been known in the recent past as a pass-happy offense, junior quarterback Cody Kessler seems content with the way the offense is rolling with a ground attack led by Allen.
“If Buck [Allen] wants to run for 200 yards and three touchdowns, that’s fine with me,” Kessler said. “I take my money on Buck [Allen] any time.”
Praise for Allen does not stop at his on-the-field production. Kessler lauded his teammate for being one of the hardest-working Trojans, a mindset that resonates with the team.
“He’s at practice every day,” Kessler said. “He just carried the ball for 200 yards. He could have easily taken Tuesday off or been light, but he’s been out here taking every rep, taking guys out so he can take reps. That’s something I respect about Buck [Allen].”
