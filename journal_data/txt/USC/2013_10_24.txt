The USC Office of Religious Life and USC Spectrum hosted “An Evening with Reza Aslan,” an event in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom in which students were invited to a talk, book sale and book signing with Aslan as he discussed his latest book, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth.
Thought-provoking · Author and scholar Reza Aslan explores Jesus as a politically conscious revolutionary at the Campus Center. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
Aslan is a writer and religious scholar, with degrees in religion from universities such as Santa Clara University, Harvard University and the University of California, Santa Barbara. His first book, No God But God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam, is an international bestseller. He has also written two other books, and edited two volumes. Currently, Aslan is an associate professor of creative writing at UC Riverside.
Aslan experienced a brief moment of fame this summer following an interview he did with Fox News which attracted a lot of media attention. In the interview, host Lauren Green asked Aslan why as a Muslim he would write a book about Jesus. The interview went viral, shooting Aslan’s book to the No. 1 bestseller in The New York Times for a short time.
Aslan began the event by discussing his initial, earliest association to religion when he was growing up in Iran.
“I’ve always sort of joked that I come from a family of lukewarm Muslims and exuberant atheists,” Aslan said. “We weren’t a deeply religious family… So when I came to the States, if I had just a little bit of Islam in me in Iran, now it was just wiped clean.”
Aslan said much of his clean religious slate was due to the hostility towards Iranians and Muslims in the United States during the 1980s.
“I did everything that I could to divorce myself from my heritage, my culture [and] my religion,” Aslan said.
Aslan also spoke about some of the controversial suggestions he included in his book such as his balance of Jesus in the Bible with  Jesus in history. He defended his stances on these hypotheses by placing them in historical context.
“We take what little we know about [Jesus] and the world we know a lot about and we use that world to create conclusions about Jesus,” Aslan said. “Ninety-eight percent of the Jews in Jesus’ time were illiterate. The only Jews in Jesus’ time who were literate were the scribes, priests and the herodian elite — Jesus was none of these things.”
Aslan said his statement about Jesus’ illiteracy garnered a greater amount of controversy from readers than he predicted would occur.
“I, for the longest time, couldn’t understand why [people were upset],” Aslan said. “And then, two weeks ago somebody was talking about this and it hit me: Because we live in a world where the literacy rate is so high, if you are American and you can’t read and write, we believe that you are stupid.”
Aslan explained that one of the reasons he wanted to write this book was to increase interest in Jesus as a person.
“I really wanted to say [in the book that] the example that Jesus provided in how to confront social injustice, how to confront the powers and gatekeepers of salvation … that example is as resonant today as it was 2000 years ago,” Aslan said.
Many students said they enjoyed the way Aslan discussed matters of faith.
“He was a really engaging speaker just with his humor and keeping you attentive,” said Daniel Dubin, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. “I really liked how he discussed religion as a language, and how only certain people understand versus others.”
Some of the students who attended said they were first introduced to Aslan and his works after his controversial interview with Fox News.
“I first saw Aslan in the interview on Fox, and he handled it pretty amazingly well,” said Jonathan Qin, a sophomore majoring in economics. “I just thought it would be really interesting to hear him speak in person, and I saw some fliers around campus so I thought, why not?”

Ronald Tutor, whose name graces both the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the USC Viterbi School of Engineering’s Tutor Hall, shared his experience in a talk to USC students on Thursday night at the Campus Center.
Homecoming · Ronald Tutor discusses how the business world is much more complex than it was when he graduated from USC. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After graduating from the USC Marshall School of Business in 1963, Ronald Tutor dedicated his entire career to the construction industry. He currently serves as president, CEO and chairman of Tutor-Saliba Corporation, and chairman and CEO of Tutor Perini Corporation.
Organized by the Marshall Business Network, Tutor’s speech attracted many students who are trying to start their own business careers and others who recognized his name from USC buildings.
“Since we have seen his name on campus every day, we are curious about who he really is,” said Alex Curiel, president of the Marshall Business Network.
Tutor discussed his own path after graduation in an attempt to inspire students thinking about what to do after USC. Coming from a low-income family living in the San Fernando Valley, Tutor said he was fascinated with the football culture at USC and enjoyed every minute of college. Fraternity experiences also made him realize that to stand out from his peers, he needed to be competitive and self-disciplined.
After working his way up the ladder in the construction industry for most of his life, Tutor came to some conclusions about how to make it in the profession.
“Playing everybody straight is the direct course to get success,” Tutor said. “Integrity brings in trust, and trust directs you to bigger achievements.”
Life, however, wasn’t always easy for Tutor. In 1972 he almost went bankrupt, but he filed a lawsuit and fought hard to eventually earn his fortune back.
“When you have no choice, just do whatever you have to do,” Tutor said.
Tutor said he learned a lot through trial and error and that making mistakes is part of life.
“Just learn from them and guarantee you never make the same mistake twice,” he said.
Tutor admitted the world has become much more complex now, but as long as students are smart, hardworking and ambitious, they will be successful.
“His experience makes me feel more connected to him,” said Tyler Soosman, a junior majoring in business administration. “He’s like us, starting from an ordinary graduate and worked hard to achieve all these.”
Tutor also used to be in the film industry but is “stepping out.” Earlier this year he sold his stake in Miramax. Tutor said focus is what makes him different and that focusing on the construction industry is what made him successful.
Tutor has been a longtime benefactor of USC and said that the university also gave him invaluable memories and experience.
“What I can do is to make it a better place,” he said of the university.
Many students said they found Tutor’s speech to be a meaningful one.
“His personality inspires us that everyone has the potential to be great by doing the right thing,” said Zach Miller, a sophomore majoring in accounting.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism held an event Thursday afternoon called “Professional Sports and the LGBT Experience” as part of its weeklong awareness conference on sports and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender experience.
Speaking out · Olympic softball player Lauren Lappin explains her experiences as a lesbian and former athlete on Thursday. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
 
The event’s panel of speakers included Billy Bean, former MLB center fielder; Wade Davis, former NFL player and executive director of the “You Can Play Project” focusing on the LGBT youth and sports; Lauren Lappin, 2008 Olympic softball player and Esera Tuaolo, former NFL defensive tackle. All shared stories of their experiences being gay in a professional sports environment in a discussion moderated by Kate Fagan of ESPN.
“We are hosting this program to bring together scholars, athletes and media to discuss the gay sports intersection,” said Adam Rogers, the conference’s co-director and coordinator. “We hope to achieve a greater understanding of how to overcome barriers to athletes and coaches being able to live openly and honestly about their sexual orientation and gender identity.”
Panelists shared personal stories of how they came out and how it affected their lives and the sports world in general. Since the panelists differed in age, their experiences varied accordingly.
“My experience in the NFL back then was horrible,” Tuaolo, one of the older  athletes, said. “I would hear homophobic statements from my teammates all the time in the locker room, which just pushed me further and further into the closet. Now, though, we are making progress and there is more support now, at least more than there was back when I was an athlete.”
Both Bean and Davis are involved in foundations that work to combat bullying. They said they now rely on LGBT youth to pave the way for athletes at different levels of competition.
“Shifting consciousness requires us to target the youth,” Davis said.
Some pointed out the role the media plays in sports and LGBT experiences.
“We have a media that really doesn’t want to address these issues,” said Cyd Zeigler, co-founder of Outsports.com and an expert in the field of sexuality and sports. “They shove the issues under the rug to avoid conflict.”
Another issue presented was stereotypes around homosexuality and particular sports.
“Throughout my softball career, the protocol of appearance was hugely important. People would say, ‘Make sure you wear a ribbon in your hair so that people don’t think you’re gay,’ and that goes to show that it’s important to get rid of this stereotype,” said Lappin, the only woman on the panel.
The panelists also discussed a few of the main reasons why athletes choose to stay in the closet.
“Society has created these ideas of masculinity that make it impossible for gay people to play sports,” Wade said. “However, if we redefine these ideas of masculinity, it would be easier for society to accept that you can be gay and still be a man.”
Bean spoke about different barriers regarding coming out, explaining that job security often is a big factor in athletes’ decisions.
“Athletes have this fear that if you take on the reality of telling the truth about yourself, you will not get the same opportunities as others,” Bean said. “The sports world is so competitive that you don’t want to give anyone a reason, such as being gay or lesbian, to not pick you to be on a team.”
Rogers, a project specialist at the Norman Lear Center, also spoke about the culture for gay athletes specifically at USC.
“The collegiate panel showed that many strides have been made in making USC Athletics an inclusive space,” Rogers said. “The leadership of Athletic Director Pat Haden has ensured that LGBT athletes have a safe and welcome place in the USC athletic culture.”
Many students found the panel members’ openness to be meaningful.
“I like how they spoke about the importance of professional athletes coming out because of its inspiration and its ability to save thousands of lives, especially the LGBT youth,” said Alex Yessayan, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development.
Others said the panel helped them better understand the plight of gay athletes.
“I have lots of friends from high school who are gay athletes,” Sarah Krenik, an undecided sophomore, said. “I think this panel has opened my eyes further as to what my friends might have experienced.”
 
This post has been updated from the original report to reflect the correction of the spelling of Billy Bean’s name. He is not associated with Billy Beane, the subject of Moneyball. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Daily Trojan sports editor Will Laws interviewed Ryan McDonald, a sports editor of the Daily Utah Chronicle, earlier this week to give USC fans a better feel for the Utes ahead of Saturday’s showdown at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
 
DT: The Utes’ QB situation is a little uncertain, though head coach Kyle Whittingham did say on Tuesday that he expects Travis Wilson to play. Do you think that’s the right move, and what kind of performance do you expect him to give?
UC: Depends on your definition of “right move.” For the short term, playing Wilson is absolutely the right move. None of Utah’s other quarterbacks can lead the offense for four quarters. In the long term, it depends on how hurt he really is, but perhaps that goes without saying. If he’s at about 80 percent, playing him would be the best route. Any less than that and Kyle Whittingham will be risking that Wilson gets hurt more.
 
DT: Last week, Utah had a classic hangover performance in losing to Arizona after beating Stanford the week before. Is this squad a sleeping juggernaut or a one-hit wonder?
UC: Definitely somewhere in the middle, but probably closer to the juggernaut side. The Utes are genuinely very good. Not great, but very good. They played exceptionally well against Stanford and exceptionally badly against Arizona. The real Utah is somewhere in between that. The Arizona loss definitely was a hangover performance, though. They’re better than that.
 
DT: Both teams are awful at converting third-down attempts. Why has Utah struggled with this, and do you see that trend turning around against USC?
UC: I did a lot of research into this a few weeks ago and I feel like it has to do with lack of production on first and second down more than it does an inability to execute on third down. They’re pretty effective on third-and-a-few, but if it gets to be third and six or more, the Utes are very bad. They really need to stay out of third and longs if they want to succeed.
 
DT: What’s the mood around campus and Salt Lake about this Utes team?
UC: Really up and down. Everyone was crazy excited after the Stanford win, but after the way Utah played against Arizona, everyone is kind of down in the dumps. Pretty amazing what one game will do. I think the fears about Wilson’s injury have a lot to do with that, though. Had the Utes lost but if Wilson was just fine, people would still be riding the wave of the Stanford win, but people are nervous about how healthy (or not) Wilson is. Gotta love the knee-jerk reactions of fans!
 
DT: Prediction?
UC: This is a tough one. To be honest, I haven’t seen USC play a whole lot. I’ll go 20-17 Trojans.

After losing its first match in more than five weeks, it might be tempting to assume the road-weary USC women’s volleyball team would feel deflated. Disappointed as they might be after Sunday’s loss to Arizona however, the Women of Troy are re-energized and hungry for another winning streak.
The team, ranked fourth in the nation in the latest coaches’ poll, will have a chance to regain its winning ways this weekend at home against their Pac-12 rivals from the state of Washington. USC will take on Washington State Friday night and then return to the Galen Center on Sunday to square off against the No. 3 Washington Huskies.
Though the Women of Troy certainly learned some tough lessons against Arizona this past Sunday, the last thing the team is looking to do right now is sit on the loss.
“I think I just have to blow this off,” USC head coach Mick Haley said about Arizona’s sweep. “We have to move forward and go to the next team. If it happens again, it will be a serious problem but if we dwell on this now, we’re wasting our energy.”
Though the outcome wasn’t ideal for USC, the team was able to find value in last weekend’s tough road trip as they approach the halfway point in the Pac-12 schedule.
“I think it’s a growing point,” senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard said. “You can’t win them all, and we have to take away what we did wrong and what we didn’t accomplish the week before.”
Specifically, Olgard believes that this is a crucial time for the underclassmen of the team to grow and do more on the court. With six freshmen on the squad’s 15-member roster, the team’s first-year players are expected to be important pieces to the puzzle as the Women of Troy move forward.
“After the game, we had a team meeting and told them that they aren’t freshmen anymore,” Olgard said. “We’re halfway through the season. Everyone needs to take on more responsibility and do a better job and keep pushing to keep our own promise to become national champions.”
For USC to start a new winning streak, it will have to survive this weekend against two tough teams in Washington State and Washington. The Cougars (16-6, 2-6 Pac-12) started the season on a 13-game winning streak but have since fallen on hard times, dropping six of their last eight matches in conference play.
The Women of Troy have won their past seven matches against the Cougars, the last one coming almost exactly one year ago when USC swept Washington State at the Galen Center. Though on paper it seems this match is headed for the same result, the team is not taking the Cougars lightly, especially after the surprise attack last weekend.
“Washington is tough but Washington State is our first match,” Haley said. “We have to play both matches this weekend. Washington State is young and dynamic, and they have a young coach who’s really got them fired up.”
Without a doubt, however, the marquee matchup of the weekend will be USC’s bout with Washington on Sunday evening. The two schools are tied for the lead in the Pac-12 Conference, but the Huskies currently have the edge in the coaches’ poll rankings due to USC’s loss last weekend. The squads most recently played each other on Oct. 26 of last year at the Galen Center when the Women of Troy pulled out the victory in five sets. The close matchup tells the story of their entire recent history: In their last 10 matches against each other, each school has won five.
“Washington is a great team,” Olgard said. “They’re always in the top five so I think we’re going to have another game hopefully like the Stanford game. That just depends on us and how we come out and play.”
Olgard will lead the offensive attack this weekend, bolstered on both sides by three star outside hitters: sophomore Samantha Bricio (who leads the team with 4.37 points per set), freshman Ebony Nwanebu and senior Sara Shaw. In order for the offensive attackers to be in position to score, they will have to rely on junior setter Hayley Crone to give them good looks. Crone, for one, is just happy to be back in Los Angeles.
“It’s comforting to play at home,” Crone said. “It’s nice to be in our own locker room in front of our fans instead of being cramped into a guest locker room. The Pac-12 is always a dogfight so it will be good to get these games at home.”
USC’s home-court advantage at the Galen Center cannot be understated — the Women of Troy are 99-10 all-time in the building and even those 10 losses have only come against five different schools. Thus far, the Women of Troy have not dropped a match at home this season.

For the first time since joining the Pac-12, the Utah Utes will come into a game against USC that both teams would consider critical. Granted, this is only the third time the Trojans and the Utes will have met as conference foes, but I certainly didn’t think three years ago that the Utes would ever be on the same level as USC.
The Trojans won each of the last two matchups with a less-than-dominating performance. The Trojans won the 2011 meeting 23-14 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and then won last year 38-28 in Salt Lake City. USC is currently a seven-point favorite for Saturday’s tilt, but there’s really no way to predict how either of these two teams will play.
At times, USC has looked dominant. Sure, the team’s top form has been limited to four quarters against a bad Boston College team and three quarters against a decent Arizona team, but the potential is there for USC to play better on both sides of the ball.
Utah comes in as a much better team than its 1-3 conference record shows. Two of those losses came against ranked teams, with the Utes losing to Oregon State 51-48 in overtime and then to UCLA 34-27. Even more impressive was the team’s 27-21 upset win over Stanford two weeks ago, back when the Cardinal were still unbeaten and in the top five of the AP poll. The Utes, however, came out flat against Arizona last week, the mere Trojan victory in conference play this year, in a 35-24 loss.
So in a nutshell, pretty much anything can happen in the Pac-12 this season, and there’s really no good way for me to predict how things will go Saturday.
But there is an important thing to take away from that: USC could still win the Pac-12 South this year and play the North champion for a spot in the Rose Bowl.
Yes, a team that lost its first two conference games of the season to equal or weaker opponents and hasn’t even faced one of the top conference foes could still legitimately win the conference.
Let’s say the Trojans take care of business against Utah. That leaves Colorado and Cal on the schedule, two teams that USC should beat, as well as Oregon State, UCLA and Stanford, who are all presently ranked. There’s no doubt in my mind that the Trojans could catch fire down the stretch, pull everything together and finish the year 7-2 in conference play.
If UCLA wins all of its games heading into the Coliseum, and Arizona State’s lone loss from this point on is against UCLA, all three teams would be tied at 7-2 atop the Pac-12 South, and BCS ranking would likely determine the tiebreaker. Or, if USC runs the table, UCLA loses to Oregon tomorrow (a likely outcome) and to the Trojans and Arizona State loses to UCLA and Oregon State (also likely), USC wouldn’t even need the tiebreaker.
If UCLA and Arizona State both finish 6-3, then the Trojans can afford losing to Stanford and just need big wins over Oregon State and UCLA, which doesn’t seem as out of reach as beating Stanford, then keep their fingers crossed for the tiebreaker.
Now here’s one last hypothetical. Let’s say USC beats Cal and Colorado, but doesn’t pull through against Utah, doesn’t upset Oregon State in Corvallis, doesn’t upset Stanford on Homecoming and has another heartbreaker to UCLA on the last game of the season.
In that scenario, USC finishes the season at 6-7— emphasis on the word finishes— because 6-7 probably means no bowl game for the Trojans.
So with so much of the season left to play and so many possibilities still on the table for USC, this Saturday is a crucial fork in the road for the Trojans’ season. Not only will the game have an impact on this season’s final record, but how the Trojans finish will also have an enormous impact on this year’s recruiting class, which currently ranks outside the ESPN Top 25, as well as Athletic Director Pat Haden’s coaching search. The better the team finishes, the more attractive the USC job appears to potential candidates.
But enough with looking so far ahead. Utah might be a very solid team, but it is also a very beatable team, just like every team left on the Trojans’ schedule. The path to Pasadena sounds crazy right now, and it still would be pretty crazy even if the Trojans beat the Utes. But there is absolutely still a chance, which is about all you can ask for at a time like this.

The USC women’s soccer team looks to bounce back from a tough loss last Friday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as they head to Boulder to face Colorado on Friday, Oct. 25 at 1 p.m. and to Salt Lake City to take on Utah on Sunday, Oct. 27 at noon.
Stalled · USC sophomore midfielder Natalie Donaldson and the rest of the team’s offense has mustered only four goals in the past seven matches. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (6-7-2, 1-4-1 Pac-12) suffered a tough 3-2 loss in overtime at the Coliseum against Arizona (7-5-3, 2-4-0 Pac-12). After the Wildcats jumped out to a 2-0 lead with 12 minutes remaining, USC got two goals from sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo to send the game into overtime. Just when it seemed like USC had taken all of the momentum, Arizona used a strong offensive push and some questionable officiating calls to set up a free kick for the Wildcats’ Jazmin Ponce. Ponce curved a shot to the top far right corner and put it in the back of the net to give Arizona a 3-2 win, despite junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley getting her hand on it.
“It’s something that we’re going to need to overcome here in a hurry and try and get our act together,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said after last week’s loss. “We’re at that point in the season where some of the kids that have been carrying a lot of the weight need some time off. We’ll be able to get some people some rest and get people prepared for [this] weekend.”
Freshman midfielder Kayla Mills is the team’s points leader with 13 (3 goals, 7 assists). Senior forward Elizabeth Eddy leads the Women of Troy with five goals, and sophomore forward Katie Johnson has added four of her own.
The late-game surge could provide an offensive spark for USC, which has been unable to consistently achieve the kind of offensive success they had early in the season. The team scored 12 goals in their first three games and put up five goals against Loyola Marymount on Sept. 15, its most since scoring five against California on Oct. 10, 2010. The Women of Troy scored more than one goal in a game for the first time since a 2-0 win at home against Florida Atlantic on Sept. 19.
“We’re just moving on, ready to go, making the next step towards what we need to do in order to succeed and win and do well this season,” Carrillo said.
Colorado (11-3-1, 3-2-1 Pac-12) is led by Anne Stuller (eight goals, six assists) and Brie Hooks (seven goals, one assist), while goalkeeper Annie Brunner has a .780 save percentage and eight shutouts on the season. The Buffaloes are returning from a road trip to Washington, where they lost 3-0 to Washington State, but beat Washington 1-0 in overtime. Colorado also played Cal to a 1-1 draw after the Washington trip.
Utah (7-3-5, 3-2-1 Pac-12) is coming off a 1-0 loss to No. 10 Stanford. Their offense is led by Katie Taylor’s five goals and three assists, while goalkeeper Lindsey Luke has compiled a .903 save percentage on the season.
Both Colorado and Utah are outscoring their opponents 24-11 on the season. USC is outscoring their opponents 25-18 and outshooting them 246-145.
The Women of Troy are 3-1 all-time against the Buffaloes and 4-1 all-time against the Utes. USC lost to Colorado 1-0 in double overtime last season, and beat Utah 1-0.

Two teams reeling from lackluster offensive performances will face off in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday, as USC will take on Utah in a matchup of squads desperate for a Pac-12 victory.
Redd alert · USC senior tailback Silas Redd (25) had 19 carries for 112 yards and one touchdown against Notre Dame, his first 100-yard rushing game since Oct. 13, 2012 in the Trojans’ 24-14 victory over Washington. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (4-3, 1-2) are looking to rebound from a disastrous week that saw them go scoreless in the second half of a 14-10 loss to Notre Dame before learning that freshman tailback Justin Davis (ankle) and junior linebacker Lamar Dawson (knee) will miss the rest of the season. Senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin was also ruled inactive for Saturday’s game.
The confirmed absences of those three only compound USC’s growing injury problem. Only one scholarship wide receiver (sophomore Nelson Agholor) has been confirmed as available for Saturday’s game, as junior Marqise Lee, freshman Darreus Rogers, redshirt sophomore Victor Blackwell and senior De’Von Flournoy are all battling nagging injuries.
The Trojans will be without all three of their scholarship tight ends. Sophomore Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick was ruled out on Thursday, and redshirt juniors Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer were listed as inactive earlier in the week. Senior defensive end Kevin Greene has received reps at practice this week, but it’s unclear if offensive coordinator Clay Helton is comfortable having Greene play on offense during a game.
“We don’t know exactly who’s going to play tight end,” Orgeron admitted.
Orgeron said that redshirt sophomore Anthony Sarao will start in place of Dawson at linebacker, and freshmen Quinton Powell and Michael Hutchings will see more playing time.
The Utes (4-3, 1-3) had to deal with injury issues of their own last week after quarterback Travis Wilson suffered a hand injury mid-game during a disappointing 35-24 road loss to Arizona. Utah posted its worst yardage output (329) of the year in the defeat. Wilson’s status for Saturday remains questionable, but he predicted earlier this week that he’d be able to take the field.
That could be bad news for USC — behind Wilson (1,655 passing yards, 14 touchdowns), the Utes have averaged 470 yards per game this season and pulled off the conference’s biggest upset thus far by knocking off Stanford 27-21 at home two weeks ago.
“They love to throw the ball and they run it really well, too,” USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron said.
Wilson has also had his fair share of growing pains, throwing 12 interceptions, but USC’s secondary hasn’t shown the ability to take advantage of those mistakes in recent weeks. After forcing six picks from opponents in the Trojans’ first two games, USC has only had one interception in its past five games.
Fortunately for redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, one of the only two Pac-12 teams with fewer interceptions is Utah, who has only come up with two interceptions this season.
Another area both teams have struggled in is third-down conversions. USC ranks last in the conference (28.9 percent) while Utah is 10th (32.3 percent). The Utes have also been the worst team in the Pac-12 at preventing opponents from converting third-down chances (41.5 percent).
Orgeron said improving that part of the game was stressed throughout practice on Wednesday.
“We had a big emphasis on third downs, that was our emphasis of the day,” Orgeron said. “It’s huge for us on defense that we get off the field, obviously. And on offense we need to make some improvement on it. We focused on it today and hopefully we’re going to be better.”
A big reason USC struggled on third downs against Notre Dame (2-for-13) was the offensive line’s frustrating tendency to commit holding and false-start penalties that often put the Trojans in the unenviable position of having to convert on third and long. The unit will have to clean up its mistakes against a relentless Utah pass rush that leads the conference in sacks (22) by one over USC.
Both teams’ kickers also faltered last week, as junior kicker Andre Heidari and Utah’s Andy Phillips each missed two field goals. In a showdown between two fairly identical teams, it’s likely that special teams could provide the difference.
The Trojans are 6-1 all-time against Utah and have never lost to the Utes in the regular season. Even though this is clearly a different USC team than the squads that reigned over the Pac-10 in the mid-2000s without much resistance, the Trojans hope to put on a similar performance for their fans on Saturday.
“We have to stand behind Coach O, we have to win for [the coaches],” Sarao said. “And we have to show everyone that we’re Trojans.”
Saturday’s game will kick off at 1 p.m. and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

This Friday marks the U.S. release of the French film Blue is the Warmest Color. Filled with compelling insights and angles, this film is by no means your average movie import. The film just won the prestigious Palme d’Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival this summer and has gotten rave reviews and received a rare NC-17 here in the United States.
Directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, a major director in France who hasn’t made much noise stateside, the film follows the homosexual awakening of a 15-year-old girl, played by Adèle Exarchopoulos, with an older college student, played by Léa Seydoux. This story happens before the backdrop of important gay rights protests in France and the movie was released a few months after the legalization of gay marriage in the country.
The three-hour epic is explicitly sexual in nature — earning that prohibitive rating -— culminating in a 10-minute-long sex scene that inspired a standing ovation from the audience at Cannes. It was released too late to be in consideration for this year’s Academy Awards, but Blue is definitely the most anticipated film to come to us from across the Atlantic Ocean this year. With all this intrigue, it might be surprising to some that much of the coverage surrounding its release deals with something even more controversial than its subject matter; instead of focusing on the film’s message and storyline, media reports have instead focused on the public feud between director Kechiche and his leading actresses Seydoux and Exarchopoulos.
The controversy boils down to Kechiche’s directing style. Seydoux and Exarchopoulos gave an interview right before the film’s debut at Cannes in which they accused their director of essentially being a tyrant on the set. Though the extra attention that this controversy has brought the film will only bring more attention to it, Kechiche’s behavior during filming and following the release of the film merits closer examination.
The accounts of his behavior on the set — and the signs point to most of it being true — sound like the caricature of an over-demanding director: over a hundred takes for one scene of the two girls passing each other on the street, followed by a tantrum when one of the actresses laughed in one of the takes. Ten days were dedicated to filming that already infamous love scene and Kechiche pushed the actresses to actually hit each other in a fight scene to the point that Exarchopoulos severely injured herself. To anyone, Kechiche sounds every bit like a tyrant. But, really, it’s not anything we haven’t seen before in film history.
Alfred Hitchcock, one of the most beloved film directors of all time, developed some notoriety for his obsessive and often abusive treatment of his female leads. His sexual harassment, psychological games and domination of Tippi Hedren, star of Birds and Marnie, in particular became so famous in its own right that last year BBC released a TV movie based on the rumors. Stanley Kubrick was notorious for being such a perfectionist that he would film more than a hundred takes for scenes and exhausting his actors.
The point is that though Kechiche’s behavior was over the top, there is a precedent in the most revered parts of film history. Those directors were given free reign and almost always delivered fantastic results despite their eccentricities and questionable methods. This derives from the concept of film directors as auteurs where they are the primary driving creative force behind a film and are allowed significant freedom in the making of a film to pursue their vision.  Kechiche was able to get away with his behavior because of that freedom, and that freedom was available because he was an established figure in the country from his previous work.
In a way, his behavior taints the movie because buying a ticket to see it equates to an endorsement of the system that allowed it to be made. The alternative of condemning a great movie because of the behavior of its director, however, sounds even worse. It would mean having to condemn countless other classic films made through similarly abusive methods. It also detracts from the efforts of everyone else involved in the film who pushed through despite the unreasonable expectations of a single, tyrannical director. Blue is the Warmest Color has plenty of other, more fascinating elements to focus on, so the tabloid antics and the caricature director should take a back seat in order for the art can be appreciated.

British singer-songwriter and  producer, James Blake, took to Hollywood Forever Cemetery — home of the Sept. 29 Breaking Bad finale screening — Wednesday night to perform hits, old and new, from his self-titled first album and second album, Overgrown, with a couple of covers sprinkled in between.
Enough Thunder · James Blake brought the crowd to life with his rich performance at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery Wednesday night. – Photo courtesy of Henry Laurisch
First, Warpaint took to the stage promptly at 6:45 p.m. The four-piece femme fatale, best known for its indie hit “Undertow,” set the tone for a unique night of music with its psychedelic sound and distinct vocals.
At 8 p.m. promptly –— practically unheard of — the man of the hour took to the stage. Blake opened with “I Never Learnt to Share,” starting alone at his piano, surrounded by darkness except for the single spotlight shining upon him. The stark contrast created by the spotlight made Blake look like the subject of a modern Caravaggio painting.
Blake crooned: “My brother and my sister don’t speak to me, but I don’t blame them,” over and over again, slowly building the song up. Ben Assiter (drums) and Rob McAndrews (guitar/sampler) — whom Blake calls “two of [his] oldest friends” — then joined Blake onstage. Finally, explosive, ground-shaking electronic sounds paired with a psychedelic light show ensued.
This introduction set the overall tone and musical experience for the night. A mix of softer, keyboard-infused moments detailing love and loss, and flashes of progressive, unconventional sounds and beats filled the cemetery. It added a sense of dynamism to the night. Just when audience members thought they had figured out the direction of the show, it changed again.
“Life Round Here” followed the opener, along with a warm welcome from Blake: “I hope you’re feeling good tonight. This is a beautiful place, and it’s a great view from where I am.”
“To the Last,” “Overgrown,” “Digital Lion” and “Our Love Comes Back” followed close behind.
The crowd was responsive to Blake. Some passionately threw themselves into high-energy numbers. The beanie-clad man standing toward the back in the center of the crowd, for instance, gyrated (almost violently at times), throwing his arms up excitedly to every drop or climactic moment throughout the show.
Others remained a bit calmer, listening respectfully, not making a peep, as Blake let out his heartfelt ballads. At times, the crowd was almost entirely silent — sometimes on its own, other times upon request by Blake. It was really quite refreshing.
In these quieter moments, Blake showcased the rawness in his voice. Though he has an incredibly keen ability to harmonize — it’s really quite angelic — his voice isn’t perfect. It was in these moments of imperfection, however when the emotion really came through, and the concert felt less like a performance and more like an invitation into Blake’s personal life.
This occurred particularly while covering Joni Mitchell’s “A Case of You,” a song met with nothing but silence and attention from the crowd. “You’re in my blood / like holy wine / you taste so bitter and so sweet,” Blake rendered emotionally. “Oh I could drink a case of you, darling / and I would still be on my feet.”
This is not a song that calls for beauty or precision. This is a song that calls for raw honesty, and that’s precisely what Blake delivered.
“Limit to Your Love” stood out in the second half of the show, inciting mass Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. activity from the audience. “Voyeur,” a funky, rhythmic number — there’s some serious cowbell action — stood out as well. It got everyone dancing, from those standing at the front of the crowd to those sitting in the back with their makeshift picnics.
“Retrograde” was another number notable for its spontaneity. Blake, Assiter and McAndrews were not entirely faithful to the album, which was refreshing because it gave the audience something new to celebrate. It showed that the trio is not just a group of studio-specific artists.
As Blake began to wrap it up, he said: “This is going to be our last one, regrettably,” and played the tune  “The Wilhelm Scream.”
But after a brief absence from the stage, and the pleas of audience members, Blake and company returned.
“I do conveniently have one more song,” Blake quipped.
And then he played “Measurements.” It was hymnal, sounding like something that would have been found on the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack. It felt a bit unexpected — the song is one of his lesser known — but it just goes to show that Blake always keeps you on your toes, always guessing. He is truly unpredictable, innovative and that’s what made Wednesday’s show, and more broadly his music in general, worth noting.

Author Randy Clemens (The Sriracha Cookbook) and food blogger Josh Lurie (FoodGPS.com), however, feel that sriracha is a versatile and exciting ingredient in its own right, and an incendiary part of the Los Angeles food scene.
That’s why these foodie friends have joined forces to bring Downtown Los Angeles its very first Sriracha Festival, this Sunday, Oct. 27, from 3 to 6 p.m. at Lot 613 in the Arts District. The event will feature food vendors from across L.A. county, as well as several breweries and bartenders, and even one company specializing in house-made ginger ale — served with or without sriracha.
The event is partly sponsored by Huy Fong Foods, Inc., the manufacturer of America’s standard sriracha sauce with the green cap, often called “rooster sauce” because of its logo. The company’s founder, David Tran, will make a special guest appearance at the event. Tran’s version of the Thai dipping sauce is vastly different from the original, according to festival co-producer Randy Clemens.
“The Huy Fong Foods version is completely American. All the peppers are grown within a few hours of Los Angeles,” Clemens said. “It’s still very much a Southern California thing.”
When Clemens was growing up, Tran’s sriracha was only available at a limited number of stores — mostly Asian specialty food markets. Now the chili sauce can be found on Walmart’s shelves and in the dipping sauce at Applebee’s.
Sriracha’s success might be attributed to its versatility. A native of Los Angeles, Clemens is especially eager to highlight the way in which sriracha, the “chameleon” condiment, works well with the city’s various types of cuisine. Some of Los Angeles’ culinary giants will be in attendance, including Eric Greenspan (The Foundry) and Christian Page (now at Short Order), and will provide new dishes to highlight this unique hot sauce.
“Some of them are already making sriracha-themed things in their restaurants,” Clemens said. “Others we reached out to because we really thought they’d have something cool to say with it.”
The traditional Thai restaurant Jitlada will bring its house-made sriracha sauce to the festival, and Plan Check Kitchen + Bar even makes a spicy fruit leather.
“I’ve learned very quickly that I’m not the only one who’s crazy about sriracha,” Clemens remarked.
Some highly touted eastside chefs will also help to spice things up. Festival participant Wes Avila might ring some bells for USC students because of his popular Guerilla Tacos truck, which parks just blocks from the festival. Avila was between restaurant gigs when he decided to use the last of his money on a cart and ingredients, and set up a taco station at The Produce Project, Downtown’s answer to the Santa Monica farmer’s market.
Avila’s vegetarian taco will feature cauliflower and a chili paste made with sriracha sauce. He has started serving his festival taco as part of Guerilla Tacos’ daily changing menu in anticipation of the festival, but at home, sriracha is a constant.
“I can’t speak for the rest of the country,” Avila said, “but here in Southern California it’s become a staple, like you see it on people’s kitchen tables pretty much anywhere. You just have Sriracha in the fridge. It’s one of those things that’s become part of Southern California.”
Los Angeles is a multicultural metropolis, and the widespread embrace of sriracha sauce by many different kinds of chefs is indicative of SoCal’s unique cuisine. Cultural collision, fusion and innovation are what gives this city its spice.
“I think a lot of people just discount Los Angeles because they think it’s a fake place,” Clemens said. “There’s nothing farther from the truth. L.A. is a great city and I think a lot of people are getting a renewed pride in things that come from their city.”
Guests who are 21 and over can purchase tickets to the Sriracha Festival in advance for $49, and gain access to all food and drink vendors. A portion of the proceeds from the event will go directly to Food Forward, an organization committed to rescuing wasted produce and donating it to more than 40,000 hungry local residents every month.
“I certainly didn’t picture any of this four years ago when I turned in my first book proposal,” Clemens said. “I hope people enjoy this festival as much as I’m going to.”
 
The Sriracha Festival will take place at Lot 613 in Downtown Los Angeles on Oct. 27 from 3 to 6 p.m. Advance tickets are $49.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently reaffirmed its 2007 findings, stating that“It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” Some supporters of the panel believe that this is a wake-up call for the climate change cause, but in reality, the report’s narrow, polemical focus will accomplish very little for the environment or for climate change reform. Americans need to look abroad, where vastly more critical action is needed. The panel’s selective interpretations will serve only to intensify the public doubt as to where the truth really lies.
Surely more attention must be given to environmental causes as a result of this report. Some of the panel’s more dubious assertions, however, cast doubt on the assertion that all people, let alone Americans, are to blame for the trends outlined in the report. This fact makes the narrow focus of the report all the more puzzling.
The implications of this report are heavily outweighed by the pollution occurring in other countries. It would appear that the infamous smog of China and, to a lesser extent, Japan, is finally rearing its ugly head. Former President Bill Clinton, commenting on the crisis, said that China has a great deal of incentive to establish regulations and make the necessary changes to stem curb the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Unfortunately, the burgeoning industrial economy in the country has forced vicious, damaging trade-offs which the government cannot help to regulate. Even where such environmental regulations exist, many businesses and manufacturers cut corners. Similar patterns across regions where industrial activity has been concentrated in the last 50 years has yielded negative environmental results. Reports such as the IPCC’s only add to confusing rhetoric, instead of addressing the real, lasting impacts of industrialization in developing countries.
Closer analysis of the report’s talking points only add to the cloudy picture established by the IPCC’s global warming experts. In one of the least cited sections of the report, it shows that “the medieval period [AD 950-1250] is found to display warmth that matches or exceeds that of the past decade in some regions, but which falls well below recent levels globally.” This seems to be a contradictory conclusion for a panel which so boldly declares that the last 1400 years of climate change occurred largely due to human activity.
Before jumping to conclusions, all people interested in climate change ought to look past the headlines and actually read some of the statements that the scientists made. Are rational, reasonable people really to believe that a period without fossil fuel activity contributed to the global warming phenomenon? With this fact in mind, it should seem impossible that the warming in that period could rival that of the 20th century, shouldn’t it?
Herein lies the fundamental problem with these reports: Any climate change appears to be evidence for these IPCC scientists. Others commenting on the climate change report, such as the Guardian, call this “regional heterogeneity” further evidence of a dangerous global trend. Interpretations of these reports would have a lot more credibility if they avoided esoteric terms such as these.
Ultimately, we all share in the impacts of the IPCC’s message. If only the rising industrial powers across the globe would take notice of the rising sea levels.

Jack – So which part did you not grasp? That the time-integral of sunspot numbers correlates with the average global temperature trend since 1610 or that if the trend is modulated by the net of ocean oscillations the measured temperature anomaly since 1895 is calculated with 90% accuracy? Everything not explicitly considered must find room in that unexplained 10%. 
Are you one of those feeding at the government trough? 
Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted in failed attempts to show that change to the atmospheric carbon dioxide level caused global warming (which ended more than a decade ago) and in unsuccessful attempts to do something about it. And now POTUS has declared war on coal.
Plants must still sort through 2500 molecules to find one that they can make into food.
Google ‘conenssti energy’ to discover what has driven average global temperature since 1610. Follow a link in that paper to a paper that gives an equation that calculates average global temperatures with 90% accuracy since before 1900 using only one external forcing. Carbon dioxide change has no significant influence. The average global temperature trend is down.
How about if they just go to google scholar, type climate change, and look at the papers for the last year.  
These papers identify over 20 feedbacks that have begun, and can not now be stopped.  They are self perpetuating.  As a soil scientist, my favored is Arctic Methane, and they have now observed methane flumes over a km wide.
Start saying you goodbyes now.  Or, better yet, call POTUS, and tell him you won’t forget his inaction, and that his name will be scorned, like Tiberius, Nero, Pol Pot or Stalin.
Silly humans.  Global temperature changes have swung widely for millennia.  Remember the ice age?  I bet you think you were responsible for that, too.
Gee, we can’t remember it because we weren’t there.  Like extreme heat, humans can’t live in those conditions.  And, even if we can adapt our physical environment, the plants and oceans critters can’t.  And, they are dying, en mass.  So, where’s will all the services nature provide come from?  Nowhere – it’s irreplaceable.
In case you haven’t noticed, scientists have been calling this the 6th great extinction for a while now, and people are beginning to notice strange things.  Like no Herring Sea Gulls in areas along the east coast.  Or, a lot more dead trees, and it’s to the point where kids ask me about it – I don’t even point it out to them.  The kids see it, why can’t you?
You call your self Mother Nature.  A wolf in sheep’s clothing is more like it.  Or, another algorithm owned by Koch.
In 2006, the UN issued the report I have linked.  It shows that rearing cattle produces more greenhouse gas that driving cars.  The greatest and most immediate impact we can have on this planet and on our own health is to dial back the consumption of animal products.

In mid-September, the Arkansas Board of Private Investigators and Private Security Agencies decided to allow school faculty members to carry arms in classrooms as defense against potential attackers. But this response does not adequately solve the issue of school shootings; in fact, it will only exacerbate the current dilemma.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
 
Conservatives assert that the largest shootings occur in gun-free zones, such as schools; therefore, arming teachers is the most appropriate answer to prevent future tragedies. But this mentality is deeply flawed.
On Oct. 24, two national guardsmen were shot by another guardsman at a Tennessee naval base. Aaron Alexis killed 12 individuals at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. Nidal Hasan took the lives of 13 innocent people at the Fort Hood military base in 2009.
These crimes occurred in areas with the presence of several armed adults. Evidently, the problem isn’t the lack of guns. The problem is the guns themselves.
Furthermore, the approach of arming faculty members assumes all educators are rational individuals, incapable of inflicting harm upon their own students. But from these recent cases of rape to physical abuse, numerous instances of teachers harming their students do exist. One cannot presume a teacher would never use his or her gun for an act of violence.
Moreover, a teacher, who has received minimal safety training — in contrast with a security guard or policeman — is less likely to succeed in defending his or her students during a crisis.
Organizations such as the National Rifle Association, which is arguably more concerned with capitalizing off of firearm sales than protecting the welfare of the American public, firmly support arming teachers and consistently oppose any gun control efforts.
America cannot resort to fighting fire with fire. Arming teachers is a Band-Aid remedy and politicians need to instead focus on implementing a lasting solution.
The core of the issue is the sale of weapons. According to the Small Arms Survey by the Graduate Institute of International Studies, the United States is the most heavily armed country in the world, with its citizens owning 270 million of the world’s 875 million documented firearms.
President Barack Obama proposed a bill that would have increased background checks before granting guns to Americans. That same bill would have banned certain semi-automatic rifles, which are often the culprits behind mass atrocities such as the Sandy Hook massacre.
But Congress rejected this bill even though nearly 90 percent of America wanted it to pass, failing to truly represent the opinions of its constituents, according to polls conducted by CNN.
In response to the failure of the bill, Obama remarked in a speech in the Rose Garden of the White House, “The American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen.”
Rather than blatantly disregarding the voices of the majority, Congress should support legislation that aims to quell the presence of guns in order to save lives and save face in the international society.
David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy believes America’s ability to lead the world is affected by its “gun-crazed” society.
The American people must continue the push for greater gun control. Otherwise, stories of murders and massacres will only further inundate news headlines. But until that legislation occurs, a more rational approach to dealing with school shootings, rather than arming faculty, is to teach educators how to disarm intruders.
Defensive Tactics Solutions, a team of law enforcement experts and professionals, provides hands-on self-defense training without the use of weapons. CNN reported how Defensive Tactics Solutions recently conducted free workshops in Lake Mary, Fla.
In Obama’s words, “We’re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.”
He’s right. Change will come. But we cannot become victim to the fallacious arguments of the NRA and other gun proponents in the meantime.

This gun debate is driving me crazy – bottomline – you can make most impact against violence (not just guns but with any tool of a criminals choosing) if stupid people stop making babies. We have too many idiots who do not know how to parent making babies every 9 months and that is why the prisons get a fresh new generation to overcrowd the cells and why our streets and schools are potential hunting grounds. Can we admit it doesn’t matter what gun laws are in place as long as we have crazed, angry, violent homicidal manics walking among us. I wonder if Piers Morgan would feel better if a family member or loved one was stabbed in the eye with a No.2 pencil and gutted with a kitchen knife, and then ran over with a car – as long as the assailant did not use a gun…
All schools should have an emergency guide in every room so students are prepared for anything
You make a better case for banning teachers than guns.
“safety training” is not the critical factor in handling a weapon, judgement is. I trust teachers over students in handling weapons. I trust teachers over the mentally ill in handling weapons. I trust teachers over criminals in handling weapons.
This article is completely mistaken in its purile argument based on lollipops and fairies.  1) There is half the violence today in U.S. than just 10 years ago (FBI Statistics on their website) 2) Britain, which has banned weapons, has TWICE the violence per capitia than U.S. over the last 10 years (British Homeland Security Report on their website) 3) Seven states in the last 2 years authorized private weapons permits holders to carry their weapons into restaurants that served alcohol.  EVERBODY claimed it would be a BLOODBATH.  In the last 2 years there have been no reported incidents.  4) If you would have taken the time to review the reports from the Washington Navy yard shooting you would have been shocked to learn — the armed guards had NO ammunition in their weapons or on their persons per the security procedures of the base. 5) Every week there are more than 50 gun and knife shows taking place around the country.  Where are the mass killings among all of the ammunition, guns, and knives at these shows which draws thousands of individuals (including criminals)? 6) There are currently 200 pages of regulations and background check REQUIREMENTS in U.S. Law. They are not enforced!  Why do you think adding more laws that are also NOT going to be enforced is going to work? 7) Security guards only need 8 hours of training of which 2 hours are devoted to weapon FAMILIARIZATION.  Police departments around the country require at least 40 hours of weapons training and require passing a weapons proficiency test before they can graduate.  The mojority of the states that issue weapons permits to individuals require the same amount of training that security guards undergo, the remaining states require MORE training than security guards.  Finally I have been a police officer in three different states over a 10 year period.  I HAVE NEVER been afraid of a law abiding citizen with a gun – in fact a couple of times I was supported by them in apprehending violent criminals.  If you want to offer opinions on issues please review the FACTS!  — “It is better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubts”.

The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation members held a candlelight vigil to commemorate the six-month anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory fire collapse in Bangladesh on Wednesday night.
The vigil began at the University Religious Center, where students read testimonies from people who had been affected by dangerous factory conditions in Bangladesh. Attendees were given a flower and a candle, and the ceremony was followed by a processional to Bovard Auditorium, where attendees were asked to sign a piece of a document in support of better factory conditions in Bangladesh.

One by one, students taped written messages to a trifold and left the candles and flowers for the administration to see in the morning. The ceremony concluded with a performance by Overflow, an a capella group on campus, that showed support for the cause.
SCALE had between 30 and 40 members who attended the vigil, which comprised of 50 attendees in total. This was the first time SCALE has had a vigil that left something tangible at Bovard Auditorium for President C. L. Max Nikias and the administration to see in the morning.
“The thought process behind organizing this event was really to spread awareness, to ask refugees to take measures in order to make sure that the workers who make the apparel are being treated fairly and safely,” said Julia Wang, a senior majoring in neuroscience.
The event was also held in an attempt to convince USC to put an end to “deathtrap” conditions in the university apparel supply chain.
“Last year, USC signed on to the Worker Rights Consortium, which was a huge step forward in cleaning up USC’s supply chain,” Wang said.
The Worker Rights Consortium is a group that monitors universities’ apparel factories worldwide, said Chanelle Yang, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development.
SCALE is still trying to convince USC to require Bangladeshi factories producing Trojan apparel to sign the Accord on Fire and Building Safety contract.
“It’s a legally-binding contract that says that factories producing [USC] apparel are held accountable for the safety violations that occur,” Yang said.
“I heard about the factory fires that were happening in Bangladesh and I realized that our university apparel was made in very similar conditions to these deathtraps,” Wang said.
Wang cited this as one of the reasons she wanted to take action and join SCALE.
Wang and many other members of SCALE view these factory workers as members of the Trojan Family, since they are essentially working for USC by assembling USC apparel. Because of this, SCALE members felt that taking initiative was necessary. It has also served to make SCALE members feel closer to the people in Bangladesh.
“I actually went to Bangladesh over the summer and I was able to talk to survivors and victims and family members,” Wang said. “Hearing their stories about how they’re affected on an everyday basis by Western brands and practices is heartbreaking.”
Through candlelight vigils such as this, as well as other events, SCALE hopes to continue to raise awareness for their cause and gain more support. “Seeing the impact that students can have on very real issues like this really made me want to join SCALE,” said Sarah Newell, a junior majoring in business administration and sociology. “Being able to use my leverage as a student at this university to make changes to the things that USC does has been an incredibly empowering experience.”
SCALE holds weekly meetings on Wednesday nights at 7 p.m. in the Social Sciences Building. This Saturday, they will hold an activist boot camp, a skills training event meant to teach members how to run campaigns successfully and mobilize people on issues to build change. SCALE also does regular worker meet-and-greets with workers at USC to make sure that USC’s workers are supported and treated well.

The Students Talk Back forum, hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute and the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, tackled public policy and college affordability on Wednesday.
Lisa Chavez, chief financial officer of California State University Los Angeles, and Michele Siqueiros, executive director of The Campaign for College Opportunity, Los Angeles, joined Megan Baaske and Taylor Wolfson, two students in the Price School, as panelists. Dan Schnur, director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Daniel Rothberg, special projects editor at the Daily Trojan, co-moderated the event. Schnur made a point to emphasize that the speakers offered multiple perspectives in his introduction.
“[Lisa] and Michele are experts in not only higher education, but higher education affordability,” Schnur said.
The two guest panelists compared the differences with public institutions and private ones. According to Chavez, the average tuition for the Cal State system has jumped dramatically in the past few years. Chavez noted a “squeezing” of the middle class that has made four-year institutions unaffordable and community colleges overcrowded due to a growing number of applications.
To illustrate this concept, Chavez compared the California community college system to a store. When a store lowers prices, more customers go there, he said, and when the store raises its prices, something needs to be done to keep customers coming.
“You either have to build a bigger store or you have to start adding restrictions,” Chavez said.
Siqueiros did not believe the main issue with college is “squeezing,” but rather “under-matching” in which low-income students with high grades do not apply to top tier universities such as USC or Stanford due to lack of financial literacy.
“Low-income students in general have huge sticker price shocks,” Siqueiros said. “While we think that there’s a lot of aid for low-income students, low-income students don’t know that that aid is available.”
Because of this, many low-income students go to the community college system and are affected by a low transfer rate and high student-faculty ratios, Siqueiros said.
Despite differing opinions on the problem, both of the speakers emphasized that policy reforms were a necessity for the public good of the state. State governments have a vested interest in education, from a purely economic standpoint, they said.
“The more money we all make, the more money we all pay,” Chavez said.
So far, current attempts at reform have been unsuccessful. Though a new California initiative, the Middle Class Scholarship, seeks to ameliorate the “squeezing” effect in the middle class, the real issue is that there is no incentive for institutions to lower their tuition, which forces financial aid through scholarships rather than direct reduction of costs.
Chavez has petitioned multiple times for increased state funding for the CSU system, in hopes that it will lower tuition. If education funding goes up, however, other state programs must be cut.
“We’re arguing against welfare and prison funding,” Chavez said.
Though there are no clear public policy solutions, Siqueiros said he hopes that Obama’s income-based repayment plan for student loans will be successful.
Another issue discussed was the rising costs of college education. Chavez and Siqueiros agreed that though intangible elements add to the value of a degree, ultimately the real value comes from employment.
“I went to college to get those things so I could get a job so I wouldn’t have to live paycheck to paycheck,” Siqueiros said.
Adrienne Liu, a sophomore majoring in political economy, said that current students should make more of an effort to inform potential students of the economic opportunities to attend USC.
“As a recipient of a merit scholarship I think it can seem daunting to middle-class and especially lower-class students, but USC offers many [financial] resources,” Liu said.
Next week’s Students Talk Back forum will focus on immigration reform.

The USC Gould School of Law announced Tuesday that it will start offering an online master of laws degree in the fall of 2014.
The school aims to provide international attorneys the opportunity to earn certificates in business or entertainment law. The program, which will begin accepting applications in the new year, offers 10 of the residential program’s core classes in an online format and has received official consent from the American Bar Association.
The school partnered with technology company Pearson Embanet, who will provide web support, maintenance, instructional design and course conversion.
Gould Dean Robert K. Rasmussen began considering an online program last year shortly after university President C. L. Max Nikias announced USC’s efforts to expand online education.
“It was really a perfect compliment of our team’s initiative and President Nikias’ university initiative,” said Deborah Call, associate dean of USC Gould’s Graduate and International Programs. “We’ve had a very successful residential master of laws program for international students for 12 years.”
Over the past 10 years, Call said, the American Bar Association has noted a significant increase in the number of international students seeking a legal education in the United States.
“By coming to the United States and earning the master of laws degree, it improves their opportunity for growth within the company or the law firm so they typically earn a promotion, and after they complete the degree it allows them to earn a higher salary,” Call said.
All courses will be taught in English and, similar to the international students in the residential masters of laws program, students who take the online courses will be required to take a test proving their English language proficiency. Call hopes the program will attract students from countries including South Korea, China, Japan, India, Brazil, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
“These are countries where there are large populations of licensed law practitioners and this program will be targeted at those that who can’t take time away from their busy law practices, their professional careers and their personal family obligations,” Call said.
While developing the program, Call and her colleagues spoke to alumni who said they enjoyed the on-campus experience but many of their associates did not have the luxury to take a year off and come to the United States. Those who take the online course, however, will have the option to attend a four-week long on-campus Summer Law and English program.
Washington University in St. Louis offers a similar program for international students and both New York University and Boston University offer online programs in tax law. Call said Gould consulted with other USC graduate schools that offer online programs during the development phase.
“We’ve worked closely with many of the university administrators across the graduate schools to ensure we are going to bring excellent quality and high-caliber students into our programs,” Call said.
More than 90 percent of students in the residential master of laws program return to their home country, Call said, but many have taken advantage of the opportunity to sit for an American Bar exam and a comprehensive understanding of the U.S. legal system allowed them to conduct more international business. The online program will offer similar benefits.
“It gives them qualities and skills that many of their colleagues simply don’t have because they haven’t had the opportunity to study in the master of laws program and that will translate whether they accomplish that through a residential or online modality,” Call said. “The online environment provides a larger audience with the opportunity to study and I feel that this is really the way of the future.”

Students had an opportunity to sample pizza, win prizes and take  pizza-making lessons at California Pizza Kitchen in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday.
USC Hospitality partnered with CPK to host the first Pizza Toss Event. The event featured trivia, pizza-eating and dough-stretching contests, and allowed students to learn how to make pizza from professional chefs. CPK also offered free samples of their new Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza.

“We wanted to give students an opportunity to come have fun, and learn about our new pizza. We want students to be aware of different options on campus for dining,” said Erika Chesley, associate director of special events for USC Hospitality.
Chesley was pleased with the turnout for the event. About 40 students were present throughout the evening.
“We really like to promote our hospitality events to get students excited about restaurants on campus,” said Annie Edwards, a member of the USC Auxiliary Services Street Team.
Members of the men’s basketball team were also in attendance at the Pizza Toss in order to promote the team’s Tip-Off event this Sunday.
“The basketball season starts in two weeks so the Athletic Department wants the student body to get to know the team and for players to have the chance to interact with other students,” said Jessica Onyepunuka, the athletic department’s assistant marketing director.
Darion Clark, a forward on the men’s basketball and a sophomore psychology major, enjoyed the opportunity to attend the event and sample the new Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza. Clark came in first place out of 10 participants in the pizza-eating contest.
“My competitive spree came out during the pizza eating contest when my teammates were challenging me,” Clark said. “It was definitely a fun event, I enjoyed myself.”
Will Liu, a sophomore majoring in economics and business administration, said the event made him more aware of the on-campus dining options at the Campus Center, specifically at CPK.
“It was a fun event and I learned about the new options they have at CPK which is great,” he said. “I might come here more often now because of the new pizza.”
Liu was on the winning team for the pizza dough-stretching contest. Winning teams for each of the different contests were awarded Ralph’s and Visa giftcards, as well as Nike Apparel packs.
Jane Zhang, a junior majoring in business administration, was also a member of the winning team for the pizza dough-stretching competition.
“My friends told me about the event so I came with them and it was fun. I tried the new pizza, too. It was really good,” Zhang said.
Initial feedback for the event and the new pizza was overwhelmingly positive, CPK Assistant Manager James Young said.
“I think students seemed really happy about our new menu items,” Young said. “We wanted to show students our new items and also show off that we have hand-tossed pizza because most students don’t realize that.”
USC Hospitality will continue to host events like the Pizza Toss in the future, Chesley said.
“We want students to know more about the options on campus so we definitely plan to have more events in the future with different venues,” she said.
USC Hospitality plans to  welcome two new venues in the spring semester, Chesley said. In January The Habit will replace Carl’s Jr. in the Campus Center, and Nekter will replace Shop Cafe in the School of Architecture and Fine Arts.
I missed this one. I would’ve attended had I known about the date and time. I’ll go next time.

Trojans are dropping like flies.
Freshman tailback Justin Davis and junior linebacker Lamar Dawson were officially declared to be out for the season by interim head coach Ed Orgeron after practice on Wednesday, adding to the laundry list of USC injuries. Consequently, Orgeron has been forced to tone down the physicality during practice.

“We just have to practice smart,” said Orgeron about the injuries. “That’s part of football; it’s going to happen.”
Davis had an operation on his ankle this week and is recovering at the hospital with family. Davis is out for the season.
Dawson suffered a severe knee injury yesterday during practice and will likely have to get surgery.
“[Redshirt sophomore linebacker] Anthony Sarao, [freshman linebacker] Quinton Powell and [freshman linebacker] Michael Hutchings and those guys are going to step up and be ready for the call,” said Orgeron.
After pushing Dawson for playing time the entire season, Sarao will get his chance to start with Dawson out.
“I prepare for every game the same. It doesn’t matter if you’re starting or not, you have to prepare like a starter,” Sarao said.
Redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey has yet to practice this week. With him out, it looks like freshman Leon McQuay III will be starting at nickel safety, taking lessons from the veterans at his position.
“[Redshirt junior cornerback] Josh Shaw and Dion Bailey are always quizzing me,” McQuay said.
McQuay has seen limited minutes this season, mainly playing on special teams. He will have big shoes to fill this Saturday.
With Shaw making the move back to corner, senior Demetrius Wright will also see increased reps at safety on Saturday.
Redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden’s status is uncertain, and the Trojans still have unanswered questions with tight ends Xavier Grimble, Randall Telfer and Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick all injured.
“We don’t know exactly who’s going to play tight end, but we still have a whole two or three days left,” said Orgeron.
Walk-on running back Taylor Ross suffered a leg injury yesterday and had to have paramedics transport him to the hospital. Fortunately, Orgeron says Ross underwent surgery and is recovering well.
Orgeron in a tough predicament in just his third game as interim head coach, but he remains optimistic.
“I think we’re in good shape,” Orgeron said. “Somebody’s going to show up and someone’s going to get take the opportunity and play very well this week. I’m sure of that.”
Corner or Safety?
Josh Shaw has played both corner and safety during this season, playing the former against Notre Dame. But as a result of the lack of productivity at cornerback versus the Irish, Shaw is switching back to corner.
“We really struggled at the cornerback position, but when he was there we weren’t struggling,” Orgeron said about the switch. “We feel that with some offenses he might have to play cornerback with some offenses he might have to play safety.”
Shaw admitted that he has not completely been able to get into a rhythm at either position since he has moved so much.
“I’m getting more and more used to it,” Shaw said. “At times it can be difficult since I’m playing safety for two weeks then corner then back to safety then back to corner.”
He has been practicing back at corner since Monday.  Despite the constant changes, he has a positive outlook on the situation.
“I welcome it,” Shaw said. “I think it’s only going to help me in the long run and for right now it’s what’s best for the team so I’m all for it.”
His flexibility has made him a healthy asset to the Trojans’ defense. Since moving to safety, he was nicknamed the quarterback of the defense, exercising his leadership on the field.
“I’ve been telling the group, it has to become personal at some point when someone’s catching the ball on you,” Shaw said. “No more, ‘we’ll get it next time.’ We have to go out there and establish what we want to do from play one.”
Kicking Competition
After junior kicker Andre Heidari faltered in last week’s game against Notre Dame missing two field goal attempts, his lackluster performance opened up the kicking competition to walk-ons sophomore Alex Wood and redshirt junior Craig McMahon. The trio have been tested on fundamentals and game situations.
But Heidari said it’s not as much about technique and fundamentals as it is about mental issues for him.
“It’s 90 percent mental and 10 percent technique and everything else,” Heidari said. “I’m like a golfer who’s lost his swing.”
Heidari suffered a torn meniscus in his right knee during the Hawaii game last season and underwent surgery.
But he said it has nothing to do with his health; he is just “in a funk.”
“When you come to USC, it’s about competition,” Heidari said.
That is exactly what Heidari has on his hands for the starting position going into Saturday’s game.
Orgeron said he is leaving it up to special teams coordinator John Baxter, and the two will discuss Friday who has emerged out of the three.

For the past couple years, a Greek god has dominated the waters of Uytengsu Aquatics Center. Well, junior driver Kostas Genidounias has at least performed like one.
Hailing from Athens, Greece, the 6-foot-1 driver is the Trojans’ second leading scorer with 53 goals through 20 games and is the only USC player to tally a goal in every match so far this season. He’s tied for eighth on the Trojans’ all-time scoring chart.
Unsung · Junior driver Kostas Genidounias might not own as many records as senior Nikola Vavic, but it seems like he’s had more timely goals.Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
He currently stands at 152 goals for his USC career, with a lot of his junior season still to come. If he stays on pace, Genidounias could have a shot at breaking the all-time scoring record that senior Nikola Vavic holds with 230 goals.
“It’s always in my head, but I try not to let it affect my game,” Genidounias said.
He has not only been known for his goal scoring, but also for his ability to put the ball in the back of the net when the team most needs it. In other words, if there was an award given to the most “clutch” player in water polo, it would be Genidounias.
“I feel like I’m just doing my job and doing what I have to do,” said Genidounias. “If the ball is in my hands with time running out, all I worry about is putting the ball in the back of the net.”
Most recently, he netted the buzzer-beating goal that tied the score against UCLA before pocketing the game-winning goal to clinch the SoCal Championship for the Trojans. He also scored the game-winner in last year’s national championship match against the Bruins to give USC its fifth consecutive national title.
“Kostas has been great for us when we have needed him most,” head coach Jovan Vavic said.
All of this late and timely scoring against UCLA has created many memories for Genidounias, and he feels that his crosstown rivals will always remember him too.
“They must not like me very much over there [at UCLA],” said Genidounias. “Scoring that goal to win the national championship was definitely my most memorable experience, though.”
If there is one thing that Genidounias loves to do, it’s winning. And that played a large part into why he ultimately decided to attend USC.
“Living in Greece, I always had the idea of studying abroad. So I went online and saw that USC had the best water polo team,” Genidounias said. “I then immediately wanted to go there and have never had any second thoughts.”
The priority of winning fares well with his head coach, who has won 12 national championships while at USC.
“It’s great to play for coach Vavic for that exact reason, you win,” Genidounias said.
The junior has already done just that by playing an integral part in the team’s last two national championships and losing just four games through about two and half campaigns.
With such great expectations, however, Genidounias receives his share of tough love from Vavic.
“It’s challenging because he is demanding sometimes,” Genidounias said. “But it is only because he wants you to get better and improve as a player.”
Rightfully so — Vavic probably expects a lot from his star player because of all the success he achieved in his first two years.
As a freshman, Genidounias was the team’s third leading scorer with 31 goals. Last year, he more than doubled that total with 68 goals, which was good enough for second on the team.
His sophomore season goal total tied for the fifth-most single-season goals in the sport’s history, and also resulted in him being named a first-team All American.
Having accomplished so much already as an underclassman, Genidounias said that right now, he is mainly focused on winning a sixth consecutive national championship for the Trojans.
“I don’t like to lose,” Genidounias said. “I want to prove that by winning two more national championships.”
Once his four years at USC are up, Genidounias, who is majoring in communication, plans to head back to his home land of Greece to play professional water polo and try out for the Olympic team.
Genidounias may be the nicest guy one will meet on land, but it is evident that he is a force to be reckoned with in the water. If he continues to play the way he has, Genidounias could very well possibly be a front runner to win the Peter J. Cutino Award next season to go along with that pair of national titles he covets.

Here’s the way I see it. If I’m wrong, let me know.
USC had one player accept a significant amount of money — perhaps as much as $100,000 — from agents unconnected with and unbeknownst to the school. The team had 30 scholarships revoked as punishment by the NCAA.
Ohio State had at least 10 players, under the direct knowledge of the head coach, take approximately $15,000 and some tattoos in exchange for their gear and other paraphernalia. They got nine scholarships revoked.
Oregon was proven to have paid a man upwards of $25,000 to illegally pay for countless recruits’ visits to the school. They got two scholarships taken.
And that brings us to Miami. It’s hard to describe the extent of Miami’s infractions. When Yahoo! Sports first broke the story back in 2011, there were cries for the Hurricanes to be given the death penalty. Booster Nevin Shapiro, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for money laundering in a Ponzi scheme, estimates he provided more than $2 million in impermissible benefits to Miami football players in the 2000s.
Shapiro provided players with strippers, prostitutes and even cocaine both in hotel rooms and on his own yacht. He even paid for an abortion when a player got one of the prostitutes pregnant. On Tuesday, the NCAA finally announced their sanctions against Miami: In addition to the school’s self-imposed two-year bowl ban the Hurricanes had already served, they would forfeit a total of nine scholarships.
Each of these, progressively, sent Trojan fans through the roof. It was hard to rationalize the relative severity of the crimes — but then again, what was ever rational about the NCAA? They even went so far as to say that they are not a court of law and not bound by precedent.
But what about logic? How can anyone say that what happened at USC is worse than what went on at Miami? You can’t. What happened at USC is a gross travesty of justice. But you know what? It would have also been a travesty of justice had Miami (or Oregon or Ohio State) been saddled with the same restrictions.
Bowl bans hurt recruiting, of course. And they hurt the bottom line of the athletic department. But they do not hurt like scholarship reductions do.
Sometime during the fourth quarter of USC’s loss to Notre Dame on Saturday I noticed 5-foot-11, 175-pound walk-on wide receiver Robby Kolanz jog to his position. In my line of sight, he passed right past 6-foot-3, 340-lb. Notre Dame nose tackle Louis Nix III. I was scared. If Nix tackles Kolanz, I thought, that poor kid is going to the hospital for sure.
Of course, that’s stupid. Kolanz has taken his fair share of football hits before and earned his spot on the team. He’s only an inch shorter and 10 pounds lighter than receivers Nelson Agholor and De’Von Flournoy. Plus, given the relative positions of Kolanz and Nix, it was unlikely they would come in contact.
But still, it reinforced the true impact of the NCAA’s sanctions on USC, now more than three years old: lower numbers aren’t just a detriment to the win column, they are a legitimate danger to players.
And I’m not talking about players who are not D-I athletes in the “athlete” sense, being thrust onto the field with Louis Nix (which, for the record, would absolutely terrify me, and I am more or less Kolanz’ exact height and weight). What I mean is just how thin a team gets stretched.
It becomes a vicious cycle. The low numbers lead to the necessity for players to take more repetitions. More reps lead to more injuries, which lead to even lower numbers and so on. Not only is it unfair, it is dangerous.
So Trojan fans, don’t be upset because the NCAA didn’t drop the hammer on Miami (or Oregon or Ohio State or Auburn or Michigan or North Carolina or … You get the picture). They might have been wrong with USC, but that doesn’t mean they also need to be wrong with every decision they make in the future. One school being impacted the way USC has is more than enough.
Be happy that the NCAA appears to have come to its senses. Do you really want to revel in the wrongful demise of another school? (OK maybe a little bit, but think about it). A two-year bowl ban and nine scholarships for Miami are no joke.
But a two-year bowl ban and 30 scholarships? At this point, it’s hard to call it anything else.

John, you have no idea what you’re talking about and passing on misinformation to try and justify something is BS.  Miami was NOT contrite.  Shalala publicly threatened a lawsuit.  That’s not being contrite, John.  That’s being quite combatitive.  
As to USC failing to cooperate, again, you’re wrong.  The COI stated in its report that USC fully cooperated with the investigation – USC simply failed to undertake the PR effort that Miami did and mistakenly did not threaten lawsuits like Miami.  As for denying, USC said that they did not know of the wrongoing of RB, and that appears to be factually true.  A The only link to USC is the alleged knowledge of Todd McNair.  A court has recently stated that it appears that NCAA was malicious and had a reckless disregard for the truth as its investigation related to Todd McNair.  Again, a recless disregard for the truth.  So, USC had no idea what was going on, although, admittedly USC could have done more to police the situation.  But this is a far cry from what Miami did.  There’s absolutely no question that Miami officials were in on this.  Miami flat out knowingly cheated.  Period.
Now, as to this silly self-imposing penalties.  this is nonsense.  If this really is the NCAA’s position to give out light penalties if a school self-imposes say a bowl ban after they go 6-6, well, this will just incentivize schools to cheat.  The school can willfully cheat, then when caught, say sorry and self impose some nonsensical penalties.  If only this were how it worked in the real world, I would be more inclined to cheat on my taxes.
You’re wrong.
You fail to mention that USC denied, denied, denied, then refused to cooperate with the investigation for months.  Ohio State also tried covering their tracks until Tressel had no choice but to confess as he had been caught red-handed.  Miami was contrite and open from day 1.  The helped with the investigation and voluntarily placed many sanctions upon themselves, including bowl bans.  Did USC?  Did OSU? no.  Miami’s admirable level of cooperation and humility is what the NCAA appreciated, and they got a gentle 9 scolarlship reduction as a result.  USC’s punishnemt was inflated due to their arrogance and thinking they were untouchable.  At least that’s the way I see it up here in the mitten.  Go Blue!  John

In a rough season for USC, one of the squad’s bright spots has been the performance of senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard. On Wednesday, Kennard was recognized for his performance as one of 20 quarterfinalists for the Lott IMPACT Trophy by the Pacific Club IMPACT Foundation. The award is given at season’s end to the defensive player of the year.
Kennard, a Phoenix, Ariz. native, is having an impressive year in defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s aggressive 5-2 system, having already totaled 19 solo tackles on top of 4.5 sacks.
Standout · Redshirt senior defensive end Devon Kennard missed last season because of a pectoral injury, but he’s made up for lost time this year by racking up 4.5 sacks and 19 solo tackles for the Trojans.Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The 6-foot-3, 260-lb senior was expected to start last year at defensive end, but was sidelined the entire 2012 season after tearing a chest muscle right before the start of the season. The injury required surgery and kept him out of every game, allowing him to redshirt for the Trojans.
During his comeback year,, Kennard has been a leader and point of inspiration for an invigorated Trojan defense that, to this point, has usually been counted on to carry a lackluster offense to a 4-3 record.
Kennard was named the Lott IMPACT Player of the Week earlier this season for his impressive performance in a 30-13 victory over Hawai’i.
The list of 20 quarterfinalists will be pared down to eight semifinalists on Nov. 13 and four finalists on Nov. 27. The final trophy banquet will be Dec. 8 at the Pacific Club in Newport Beach, Calif. If Kennard were to win the award, USC would receive $25,000 for its general scholarship fund. All four of the finalists will win $5,000 for their school’s general scholarship fund.
Kennard joins an impressive list of players who were also named quarterfinalists, including linebackers C.J. Mosley of Alabama and Anthony Barr from UCLA.
In total there are 11 linebackers, seven defensive backs and two defensive linemen on the quarterfinalist list. Since the award’s inception nine years ago, the Lott trophy has been awarded to linebackers and defensive linemen four times, and defensive backs only once.
The rival Bruins are the only team to have multiple quarterfinalists, as linebacker Eric Kendricks was named to the list in addition to Barr.
The Pac-12 conference as a whole has five quarterfinalists, which is fitting considering the fact that Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott will be the keynote speaker at the banquet in December.
