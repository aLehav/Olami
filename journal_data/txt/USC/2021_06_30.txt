May was a hectic month for Amelia Garvey, the 5-foot-9 inch calm and lighthearted former USC golfer. She turned 21-years-old, graduated from USC with a degree in communication and became a professional golfer all in one week. 
That week is just one example of how Garvey has adapted throughout her entire life. 
The plastic set of golf clubs 
Born in Manchester, England, Garvey and her family moved to Christchurch, New Zealand when she was five. Her father, Lee Garvey, was offered a new job that he felt would be a better place for his children. 
Garvey played every sport imaginable as she grew up until her father bought her a set of plastic golf clubs. Without any practice, Garvey started swinging the clubs and her father soon realized there was some talent there. 
“He kinda was a bit shocked with how good I was swinging it, and he said, ‘OK, well, let’s maybe get you out to a golf course,’” Garvey said. “I just started with some little junior program at a small course near my house.” 
Her father was right — Garvey did have a special talent. As she traveled the world competing in tournaments, Garvey found herself ranked third as an amateur in high school and in 2017 was ranked first at the New Zealand Women’s Amateur Stroke Play Championship.
It didn’t start to register to Garvey that she could go far in golf until she and her mom, Beverly Garvey, attended a tournament called Junior Worlds in San Diego, Calif. It’s when both were shocked at what was ahead for Garvey and her family. 
“It was really overwhelming. To be fair, I didn’t really know what to expect. And all of a sudden, I had like 15 coaches watching me,” Garvey said. “Obviously, it’s a big tournament where coaches go out and recruit. My mom came out with me to that tournament, and she had no idea either.” 
She joked at how her mom wouldn’t be able to know a bad shot or a good shot in golf at that time and definitely didn’t know what to say to the group of coaches approaching her about her daughter.
“It was a bit of a shock to see the amount of people, and then even there were parents of the other players who Amelia was playing with were making comments about Amelia and asking me if I have got her to sign up for college and things like that,” Beverly said. “I was thinking, ‘What are they talking about?’ She was just Amelia to me, and I wasn’t really thinking. And Amelia never really thought about that either.”
One of the recruiters came up to Beverly asking her about Garvey and they held a brief conversation until 
the recruiter walked away to observe another golfer. Beverly thought nothing of it and continued to watch her daughter play. About 10 minutes later the recruiter walked back to Beverly. 
This time the conversation took a completely different turn. 
“I’ll never forget what [the recruiter] said, she just turned to me and she said, ‘Mrs. Garvey, you told me your daughter was good, but you never told me she was the real deal.’” Beverly said. “And then, after maybe 10 to 15 minutes, she disappeared and all of a sudden, I was surrounded by probably nine college coaches coming to watch Amelia.”
That tournament was the beginning for Garvey. She started receiving scholarships from multiple powerhouse schools, including the University of Oklahoma. Garvey took half her college visits with her dad and half with her mom. 
When she and her mom arrived at USC it was a done deal and Garvey is thankful she made the right decision, one she said that has been amazing. 
“When I saw USC, it was instant. I fell in love with the place and just the whole environment. It just feels like it breeds amazing athletes and students, which it does,” Garvey said. “So I definitely knew straight away when I came on my visit that this is where I wanted to come.”
Beverly saw firsthand USC’s immense interest in her daughter and her talents. Remembering that moment still brings tears to her eyes when she visualizes the glowing happiness her daughter had knowing she was going to be a Trojan. 
“I just remember us being in the hotel room and Amelia said, ‘Oh my gosh, Mum, I can’t believe that they would want me.’ Because she’s such a modest person, I said ‘Amelia, why wouldn’t they want you?’” Beverly said. 
Amelia stood up on the hotel bed and started jumping up and down. She didn’t know how to contain her happiness and her mom was in awe to see how happy her daughter was with this decision.
The transition came quickly. Garvey committed to USC and, at 17, was getting ready to pack her bags for a longer absence than her family was accustomed to. 
“It didn’t really hit me because Amelia, for a long time from being about 14, she had kind of gone away to play golf tournaments around the world for New Zealand. So I was used to her packing her bag and going,” Beverly said.
Habits and routines produce results
A typical day for Garvey starts at 5:30 a.m. as she travels to practice at the Rolling Hills Country Club. After a couple hours on the course, she heads back to campus for workouts at 11 a.m. Once workouts end, she heads to class. 
As Garvey now looks to change her routine to benefit her professional career, she said she would miss her collegiate habits. 
“I absolutely love it; and I would get home and [couldn’t] wait to go back to the golf course the next day. So, I think that’s what makes college golf amazing,” Garvey said. “I think it’d be a lot harder if you were dragging yourself out of bed and having to go out there on your own. Just having the team around you, having the coaches there.  It makes it a lot more enjoyable.” 
While at USC, Amelia had several achievements beginning her first year. 
She was a six-time starter during her freshman year in 2018, finishing in the top 10 once during the season and four times in the top 30. Although looking to take the confidence she had freshman year, Garvey’s sophomore year presented some challenges.
Head coach Andrea Gaston, who had been with the USC program for over 20 years, decided to take an offer from Texas A&M. USC appointed Justin Silverstein who would be with Garvey for the next three years of her career.
Her sophomore season wasn’t as favorable for her as she didn’t make the travel teams as consistently as she had in the prior season. Garvey missed about three to four travel teams in a row, resulting in personal frustration and doubts. 
Halfway across the world from her family and friends, her golf career did not seem favorable at that time.  
Eventually, Garvey’s doubt turned to motivation and an opportunity for her to mature not only as a player, but as a woman, she said. 
“I definitely matured a lot in my sophomore year. I wouldn’t change it for the world. Now, even though at the time it felt like I wanted to go back home, I wanted to give it up here,” Garvey said. “Those few months in that semester, where I missed teams and stuff like that, it taught me so much. And it made me grow up a lot and realize that nothing’s not ever going to come easy, especially when you’re trying to be an elite athlete.” 
Silverstein said Garvey overcame the tough moments through her mental approach to those frustrations.
“In the beginning, she was letting the not traveling frustrate her and that was kind of boiling over,” he said. “As she progressed, as she grew up, whenever she had a setback, she would use it as fuel and wouldn’t let it just simply kind of boil over and frustrate her. So, she changed her outlook, she really got into a lot of meditation work.”
The two-time All American
Looking back, Garvey said she is grateful for those tough lessons as it helped prepare her for her future. 
She finished her career as a Trojan two-time All American and was ranked in the top 25 for world amateurs. She’s earned multiple honors from All-Pac 12 first team honors. 
Silverstein has seen the evolution of Garvey firsthand and knew her talent was through the roof immediately when watching her. Silverstein said he was confident that one day Garvey would become a professional as long as she had smart habits. 
“She’s obsessed with golf,” Silverstein said. “Her talent pops off the page. She’s got crazy speed — swing speed — which is a talent in golf. She possesses more of that than anyone we’ve ever seen. She simply swings the club faster than any player we’ve ever had, swings it as fast as pretty much any good player in the world.”
Garvey spent eight months away from the United States due to coronavirus before returning in December to finish her senior year. She played in the U.S. Open Qualifying tournament and, before she knew it, snuck her way into the U.S. Open. 
“Nationals were finishing around the end of May, and the U.S. Open was the first week of June. So, obviously, I was going to be done with college stuff straight after nationals,” Garvey said. “I had the opportunity to turn pro if I wanted to and play the open as a professional. I talked to my team about it and weighed up the pros and cons and there wasn’t really any [cons].”
Her parents knew her plan was always to be a professional and anticipated her to go pro at the end of the year, so it came as a little surprise when Amelia called her parents at 3:00 a.m. to tell them what her next steps were. 
“She played the U.S. Open qualifying, and she qualified and the phone’s ringing,” Beverly said. “It’s Amelia yelling, ‘I qualified!’ Me and my husband are laughing, and then in the next breath she goes, ‘I’m gonna turn pro!’”
Beverly said the decision to turn pro “seemed like the right time.” 
“It’s her decision and we just support her, and we’re not going to talk her out of it,” Beverly said. “We trust that her judgment is right, even though she’s only young.” 
21st birthday, college graduation and professional golfing debut 
The couple weeks between May 19 to June 6 was a bit of a whirlwind for Garvey. Her family wasn’t able to attend graduation, her 21st birthday or her first tournament as a professional due to the coronavirus travel restrictions in New Zealand. Luckily, her parents sent her some gifts and watched virtually as they celebrated their daughter. 
Garvey’s goal has always been to play golf at the highest level. She knows that it will be an adjustment but those around her know if anyone has the ability to do it, it’s her. 
“She’s got a great work ethic, and she just needs to get a little lucky — things have to fall the right way. She’s gonna put in the smart work, which I think is an underused term in sports, not just hard work, but smart work,” Silverstein said. “I think she’s got a great chance to be one of the best players in the world.” 
Garvey will always appreciate her time at USC and said it was some of the best times of her life. Now her mind has shifted from being a student athlete to a full-time professional. 
“A lot of people were asking whether I was going to take that fifth year, and I did love my time at USC. But, even just everything outside of the golf course that comes along with being a professional athlete, I realized that that’s going to take up a bit of time, too,” Garvey said. “So now that classes are gone, it’s almost being replaced by other stuff. I’m really looking forward to it, and I’m looking forward to hopefully a long career.”
As Garvey stood there on her first day at the U.S. Open as a professional golfer for the first time, all she could do was take the moment in and realize how far she had come. 
“I just try to be as present as possible. At the end of the day, I’m going to shoot what I’m going to shoot, but [I] just go out there and enjoy it because you don’t get many opportunities like this,” Garvey said. 
Silverstein calls Garvey one of the funniest people he’s ever met and bragged about her ability to lead a team in a relatively individual sport. Those characteristics assure him that Garvey will have a productive career. 
“She just needs to continue doing what worked in college,” Silverstein said. “Not veering too far from that which a lot of players do and [what] they get on their own, but I think she’s so smart, [she] thinks about golf in such a well rounded fashion. I think she’s gonna be just fine.” 
Garvey has a lot of work to do as she starts her early professional career and is ready to put forth every challenge and triumph that will come along the way. But, she still has one goal that she will be striving for in the coming years specifically in 2024. 
“The Olympics. It would just be a dream come true and to be there representing my country,” Garvey said. “Not a lot of people in the world can say that they are an Olympian. And once you’ve played in the Olympics, you’re an Olympian for life.”

Another week means another column, and this time is the last time. Well, at least until August. 
And the Los Angeles Clippers are still alive. 
No, they didn’t roll over and die after the series was tied two games to two against the Utah Jazz. And, no, they didn’t hide in a corner and cry after the Phoenix Suns went up three games to one.
It’s like that one scene in “Rocky 1” when Apollo Creed kept pounding Rocky with punches in round 14, and he kept taking hits around the turnbuckle while Mickey yelled for Rocky to stay down.
Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue might not be Mickey, but forward Paul George and company are most definitely Rocky Balboa — they simply don’t quit.
The Clippers have been down two games to none in all three of their playoff series this year. Each time, they’ve come back even when it would be easy to just quit. 
Being down their franchise superstar Kawhi Leonard seemed like it would have been enough to eliminate the Clippers against the Utah Jazz in the second round. Like I said in my previous column, they still had a chance with the series tied at 2-2 and it came true, as they won the next two games. 
With the Suns being up 3-1 and in charge of winning game five at home to seal the series, it was the Clippers’ time to hold off on the party in Phoenix.
George had yet another ridiculous performance to send Suns — and many Lakers — fans home in anger and me back to my computer to write a new column.
I was so sure the Suns would pull it out that I prewrote a column about the Clippers offseason. What a noob I am.
PG’s 41 points, 13 rebounds and six assists game proved to be enough to shut the loud crowd at Talking Stick Resort Arena up. Guard Reggie Jackson continued his lights-out playoffs with 23 points, along with forward Marcus Morris adding 22. 
Jackson’s been having a playoff run that will bring him lots of dollars this offseason. He’s one of two players in NBA history to average 3+ three-pointers on 65 TS% in a single playoff. 
The other being Steph Curry.
It was evident in Monday night’s game too. Jackson made the big shots whenever the Clippers needed them most. 
When the Suns fought back to cut the Clippers lead to four with just under seven minutes left, Jackson proceeded to hit a three to answer back, then iced the game with a three and dunk on back-to-back possessions to extend the Clippers lead to 12 with four minutes left. 
But the story of the game was one not seen on the stat sheet — the determination and heart of the Clippers. They clearly wanted the game more, diving for loose balls, making timely baskets and responding on every play. 
Luck was involved too, of course. The Suns missed some easy ones, and it seemed like everything that could go wrong, would go wrong for them.
With this being said, you can’t take anything away from the Clippers. Whenever their backs are against the wall, they make sure to show up.
And Lue keeps them prepared and positive. With the win Monday night, Lue’s record in elimination games as a head coach moves to 10-2. 
The question now though is if the Clippers can actually pull it off. 
History and numbers are more on the side of the Suns in this case. Teams that are up 3-1 in the Conference Finals have won 40 out of 43 times. 
Lue does have experience coming back from a 3-1 deficit of course. His Cleveland Cavaliers became the only team in NBA Finals history to do so after beating the Golden State Warriors in 2016. 
The last time a team that beat the odds in the Conference Finals though? 
2016. When Steph and Klay Thompson went berserk to bring the Golden State Warriors back — two players the Clippers do not have.
Nevertheless, it’ll be a battle and if the Clippers steal game six at home, anything can happen.
We’ll just have to see.

For the first time since 2019, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will be the site of an internal migration on Saturdays, with fans from all over convening to pack the seats of the storied stadium. The buzz around the stadium will once again be heard for miles. 
USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced June 15 that the Coliseum would once again host crowds at 100% capacity in Fall 2021. Athletic events in the stadium will also adhere to California Department of Public Health coronavirus guidelines surrounding outdoor events, including mask wearing and submitting proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test results. However, guidelines are set to be reevaluated no later than Sept. 1.  
“We thank our fans in advance for their willingness to follow those protocols so we can all enjoy watching the Trojans,” the statement read. 
The news was met with enthusiasm from students and fans on social media, as many students will get their first opportunity to witness a Trojan football game in person. After a 5-1 season with a conference championship appearance, head coach Clay Helton has generated ample excitement surrounding next season’s team, coming off of a strong recruiting campaign. Ranked the seventh best recruiting class in the nation by 247 Sports, the group is highlighted by five-star defensive lineman Korey Foreman and four-star quarterbacks Miller Moss and Jaxson Dart. 
But there will be none more excited that fans will be allowed back into the Coliseum than the players and coaches on the field, who rely on the energy from the home crowd to pump them up throughout the game. In a September 2020 press conference, Helton said the fans would be missed after the Pac-12 announced that stadiums would be empty for the 2020 season. 
“There’s going to be an extreme sense of urgency for players and coaches alike to … manufacture their own energy and to let it ripple through the team,” Helton said.
Now, with fans returning, the players and coaches on the sidelines won’t be entirely responsible for producing their own energy, and will be able to feed off the excitement of the home fans for the first time since 2019.  
The Coliseum can hold up to 77,500 spectators, making it the 25th largest college football stadium by capacity in the country. A $315 million renovation which reduced the capacity of the stadium from 93,000 was completed in 2019, partially in preparation to be one of the host stadiums for the 2028 Olympic Games. 
The USC football home opener is set for Sept. 4, as the Trojans face San Jose State.

Last year, Alex Zarchy found herself stressed out from running the social media accounts of two organizations. She was spreading herself thin by writing and strategizing social posts and asking favors from friends to assist her with graphics. 
Zarchy, a sophomore majoring in public relations and nongovernmental organizations and social change, realized she could turn her self-described “one-woman PR firm” into an organization of her own, and she did just that. Two Cents Public Relations, a firm dedicated to helping socially conscious businesses, nonprofits and artists, was launched February 6.
According to Zarchy, what makes Two Cents different from other PR firms is that it is run solely by 15 USC students with different majors and talents brought on by Zarchy herself.  
“None of us have graduated college or gone to grad school, so we’re creating content that we’re not being taught,” Zarchy said. “We are kind of coming up with it ourselves and reinventing what public relations looks like.”
One of the peers Zarchy invited onto the Two Cents team is Trinity Lee, a sophomore majoring in art history and law, history and culture. While originally set to be a writer for the organization, as time progressed, Lee found herself in the graphic design and event planning teams as well. 
Though Lee never thought she would find herself writing press releases or designing graphics for organizations, Two Cents pushed her out of her comfort zone and gave her the confidence to try her hand at new things.
“Something that [Zarchy] wanted was for us to experience different things, and if there’s something we were interested in that we wanted to try, to try it,” Lee said. “We’ve been kind of dabbling in a lot of different areas of what we do.”
The team’s work focuses on the change they believe their generation, Gen Z, wants to see. Before working with the socially conscious organization or a person of their choosing, criteria must be met. 
“Our mission is pretty much formed by all of us. We’re all taking part in putting together what we want to do and what we want to accomplish,” Lee said. “A big part of that is uplifting, empowering and broadcasting really important work; the things that we believe should be seen and should be exalted, that isn’t as of right now.”
The term “socially conscious” has become a buzzword of sorts that has been slapped onto many brand identities but, in most cases, isn’t actively defined. For Zarchy, it was important to define that term and create something that reflected everyone’s values at the organization. 
“Socially conscious businesses for us promote your creative expression, contribute to a social cause — monetarily or through direct action — lift up community voices fighting for social justice [and] have sustainable output and ethically sourced materials,” Zarchy said. 
These different entities that are uplifted through Two Cents are represented in the traditional sense with promotion including social media graphics, but Zarchy also made it a priority to foster collaboration within their partnerships. 
Zarchy said she wants Two Cents to bridge the gap between different entities depending on what their goals are. For example, if a restaurant is looking to garner more attention, the Two Cents team could connect them to an artist and commission a mural; if a nonprofit needed a place to hold a banquet, Two Cents could point them toward a small restaurant they are working with.  
While social consciousness is a factor in the selection process for Two Cents, fitting the criteria doesn’t give businesses the firm’s stamp of approval right away. The organization has weekly Monday meetings dedicated to deeply understanding their potential clients and how their missions would be complementary.
Before getting into the nitty-gritty of each meeting, though, the team goes around sharing their “happy crappies,” where each person shares something great and something not-so-great about their day. Once the ice is broken, it’s on to business.
When potential representees come into a meeting, the team seeks to become more knowledgeable on who they may represent, so they ask questions about what goals the business may have or what their priorities are. This is then often followed by a pitch put together by the collective. 
“[We want to know] why do you want our services? What are your goals?” Lee said. “And that’s followed up with a pitch … [we] give you based on what each of our teams has identified as ways that we can provide our services for each of your goals and what our signature Two Cents touch would look like for your organization.”
Currently, there are three organizations that have made it through this selection process. They act as case studies for the student-run organization to make sure that Two Cents is equipped to continue and further expand their future ventures. 
In the beginning, each case study would get three months of free services from Two Cents in exchange for access to their analytics and the income that came into their business. The first business to sign on to Zarchy’s ambitious proposal was the Black-owned Hot & Cool Cafe, which serves healthy food options and acts as a community hub in Leimert Park, a Los Angeles neighborhood. 
Last year, Zarchy worked with a formerly incarcerated man named Tobias, whose sentence was commuted from a life without parole sentence and was later hired by the only place that would hire him — Hot and Cool Cafe. Zarchy and Tobias would meet at the cafe every Monday at 2:30 p.m. without fail.  
After discussing her idea of a student-run PR organization with Tobias at one of their weekly coffee meetings, he suggested that she propose the idea to the cafe’s owner, Tony Jolly. As soon as Jolly heard Zarchy’s plan, he was all in.
In the short time Two Cents has been around, the firm was able to completely reinvent the way Hot & Cool was presented on social media platforms such as Instagram.
“Our digital footprint increased dramatically. We were able to put strong content on our social media pages,” Jolly said. “That was well-received by all ages. [Two Cents] went above and beyond by adding certain videography to the content by interviewing me and interviewing employees.” 
All of the posts on Hot & Cool Cafe’s Instagram are now more cohesive and give audiences a sneak peek into the lives of those who make the cafe what it is. Other than the addition of interview snippets and photos of food on the cafe’s Instagram page, Two Cents also connected a local artist to Hot & Cool to have merchandise designed. 
It implemented changes that have given the cafe the step up that Jolly had never imagined, all done by a group of college students. 
“They set a precedent [for] our image, and I couldn’t duplicate it. It’s like our image belongs to Two Cents now,” Jolly said. “So, I gotta do whatever it takes to keep them around. I forget they’re college students. I thought I was working with a marketing agency at one point.”
Other than Hot & Cool, Zarchy is in the process of integrating two more case studies in her team’s workflow. One of them is with artist Willie Baronet, who has a nonprofit called “We Are All Homeless,” where he buys homeless signs from people on the streets and uses them for large art installations. 
The last case study Zarchy is really pushing for is to represent someone pro bono and find someone that fits their mission. 
As time progresses, Zarchy wants to make sure that Two Cents remains authentic to its mission and doesn’t become the stereotypical dishonest mega-corporation that many on the outside view public relations as.  
“There is so much mistrust with PR firms. There’s such a reputation of over-exaggerating the truth,” Zarchy said. “I want people from all walks of life to be able to come in and [know] the story that’s going to be put out there is [their] narrative. [I want them to say], ‘I am paying this person to be as authentically true to myself and the story that I want to share.’”
While Zarchy has crafted fun photoshoots and created events for socially conscious businesses, Two Cents is much more to her than what some would see as a college project. She hopes that the work she has begun expands and lasts a lifetime.
“I’ve been telling every single person that entered [our] space [that] this is not just a fun college startup for me,” Zarchy said. “If I get to tell stories about people who I care about, and people who I believe in for the rest of my life, … then that’s what I get to do with my life.”

Setting up Lally and Sammy’s for the day at 9 a.m., cleaning the variety store’s shelves and rearranging clothing, Beatriz Hernandez has thoughts occupied by a looming threat. 
The looming threat is a call from her landlord, whose calls have become increasingly demanding since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving Hernandez and her daughter Samantha Mendez, who also works at the store when she is not attending school, stressed and often depressed. With overdue rent piling up and business worse than before the pandemic began, Hernandez faces the risk of eviction from her once successful business, losing not only her source of income, but the store she loves.
“At the start of the pandemic, the [landlord] was a bit conscious, and he said there wasn’t any problem. But I tried to pay at least half of the rent or whatever I could,” said Hernandez in Spanish. “But now, the [landlord] is hovering over me and wants me to pay more — he wants me to pay or leave.”
Six years ago, Hernandez saved enough money to achieve her dream of opening her own clothing and convenience store — a place where she can sell what she wants, decide her own prices and make more money. 
Ten years beforehand, to save money, Hernandez worked long hours, early mornings and late nights, spending nights in her car with her two daughters because they didn’t have enough time to go home.
“We would wake up at three in the morning so we could have enough time to set up and everything,” Mendez said. “In the morning, we wouldn’t have time to go anywhere, to go eat breakfast or have enough sleep. We would also sleep in the truck because we wouldn’t get enough sleep.”
Located a little over a mile from USC and downtown in South Los Angeles, the outside of her store is covered with a mural depicting yellow sunflowers and a warm red heart painted on top of a light blue background. “Lally and Sammy,” the top of the mural reads in red and pink lettering, is named after Hernandez’s two daughters, Lally and Samantha Mendez.
Before the pandemic, Hernandez’s business was successful — she made more money with better hours than she did at her old job at a cafe. 
But now, her business hangs on by a thread. Hernandez had to shut down the store for four months, and she continues to struggle to get as many customers as she did before lockdowns began last March.
 The prospect of losing her store as well as the loss of customers weighs on Hernandez, Samantha said.
“She feels stressed because of all the calls she gets from the [landlord],” Samantha said. “She says she sometimes falls into depression… Some days she doesn’t even make 10 or 20 dollars.”
 The pandemic has been a turbulent time for many business owners, with more than 200,000 additional small business closures coming as a result of lockdowns and changing customer habits, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. According to the Small Business Administration, the United States issued $799 billion at time of publication in forgivable loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, a major lifeline to businesses. However, reports have shown that these loans have not been distributed equally, with Black, Latinx and Asian borrowers facing significantly more barriers to receiving loans than white borrowers.
According to the Los Angeles Times and Reveal Center for Investigative Reporting, businesses in majority white neighborhoods received PPP loans at a two times higher rate than in Latinx neighborhoods, a 1.5 times higher rate than in Black neighborhoods, and a 1.2 higher rate than in Asian neighborhoods. 
Director of Fair Lending at National Community Reinvestment Coalition Anneliese Lederer said that there were certain barriers that caused the PPP loan disparity, including a lack of existing relationships with banks, banks discouraging Black and Latinx people from applying for loans, inequality in outreach and an initial rule that did not allow people with criminal records or who had defaulted on student loans to benefit from the PPP program. 
A report from the NCRC sent comparable applications from Black, white and Latinx small business owners to banks and found that white owners were granted loans at higher rates than Black and Latinx owners, even when all other factors were equal, Lederer said.
“The PPP loan specifically is a program that is supposed to save businesses. If you can’t access this money, you can’t save your business,” Lederer said. 
Michael Chasalow, a professor at the USC Gould School of Law and director of the USC Small Business Clinic — an organization that began providing pro bono legal services to small businesses during the pandemic — said complicated rules and unclear messaging contributed to the challenges faced by small businesses. 
“[The PPP program] was advertised as helping small businesses but you needed a legal team to navigate just the application process,” Chasalow said. “The businesses that were in a position to have either a lawyer or maybe even a banker that would help them navigate the system, got money right away.”
Conflicting messaging, such as those that suggested some small businesses could not access funds or that the government would ask for their money back, may have played a role in some small businesses owners’ hesitation in accessing loans, Chasalow said.
“Because they didn’t have a navigator, they just opted out completely, like ‘When in doubt, don’t mess with the system,’” he said.
Although rules eventually changed to favor small businesses, “by then, you had a lot of businesses that just felt like it was too late and too uncertain to mess with,”Chasalow said.
Surrounded by colorful clothes draping the walls and walkways of Lally and Sammy’s, Hernandez’s daughter Samantha said the store is important to her and her family, remembering the hard work it took to open it. Samantha has helped her mom work nearly her entire life, accompanying her mom to work since she was two years old. 
Thinking about the late nights Samantha has spent working with her to open the store and pay the bills, Hernandez said that Samantha “helps me too much.”
All the hard work and the store matters to Samantha. She, too, often worries about it closing, she said.
“It actually means a lot. From here, we eat, pay bills and buy stuff that we want,” Samantha said. “The store is really personal to me.”
With the stress of navigating the pandemic, Hernandez said she sometimes feels like giving up.
“Essentially, it’s affected everything … all of this affects me emotionally. I get anxious of paying the rent,” Herndandez said. “Los días están feos. La gente no viene.”
Other times, Samantha said, Hernandez motivates herself to work harder, desperate to get customers to start shopping at the store like they did before the pandemic. 
“She comes and leaves super late. She stays cleaning and organizing or moving stuff for the store to look better,” Samantha said. 
Still early in the morning, Hernandez walks behind the counter, prepared for the day ahead of her, clothing lining the walls and steady, upbeat music thumping throughout the store. Now 9:45 a.m., Hernandez has cleaned and rearranged the store, hoping to once again see the normal flow of customers walk through the door.

A joint collaboration between the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Sol Price School of Public Policy, the USC Center for Sustainability Solutions aims to find ecological solutions for the community. In 2020, the center initiated the Undergraduate Sustainability Grand Challenge Fellowship Program. 
The program invites all undergraduate students to participate in the challenge of finding sustainability solutions with the fellowship and includes a monetary award as support for their research.
 “The goal of the center is to come up with Grand Challenge solutions to sustainability,” CSS Co-Director Mahta Moghaddam said. “So these would be not just engineering solutions, not just public policy solutions, but the intersection of the technological type solutions that are adoptable from a public policy perspective and are viable.” 
 Many undergraduates have partnered up to compete for this one-year fellowship that is renewable for up to three years. The winners will receive up to $5,000 to continue the research and implementation of their sustainability solution. The award, can either be a $3,000 award for the academic year or a $2,000 award for the summer. The deadline for the proposals is July 1.
The proposals must be a maximum of five pages with multiple technical sections which include the introduction, the problem and the objectives, the approach, expected significance and the plan of work and milestones, where students have to show that their project will require a whole year or the summer to research and work on.
The fellowship’s application process not only includes a proposal for a field project research for sustainability but also allows for innovation and creativity, Moghaddam said. 
“We want to leave it wide open because we really believe that our undergraduates are brilliant, and they are very resourceful,” Moghaddam said. “They are in touch with the needs of society now, and they’re the force of the future. So we would really want to leave it open for them to come up with very creative ideas and to engage faculty in those ideas.”
Two students currently applying for the fellowship are rising juniors Sandra Maestre, who is majoring in architecture, and Camila Rojas, who is majoring in industrial and systems engineering. When Maestre received an email from the School of Architecture that introduced her to the fellowship, she reached out to Rojas and they began working on pursuing the fellowship together. 
Maestre and Rojas are interested in urbanization and their goal, if they win the fellowship, is to first implement their proposed solution in Skid Row to see if it works there. If successful, it can make the “tweaks of what is necessary within that community.” Rojas said they plan to apply it to other communities, and possibly around the United States.
“I’ve always wanted to help people through architecture and what we’re doing is related to design,” Maestre said. “I just feel like finally everything I’ve been studying, since I was born, would be a real impact that I can see, and I think that’d just be amazing.”
While students work to win the fellowship, Rojas said they like the fact that they can help the community and look forward to the work that will await them if they land this opportunity.
“I think I would feel honored to win, especially since it’s such a competitive program,” Rojas said. “But most of all, not only honored by the work that we will put forth, but I would also feel great to be able to give something to the community.” 
The process also requires students to include two different schools’ perspectives in their proposal, such as engineering and public policy, Moghaddam said. Students are expected to reach out to faculty members before they submit their proposals through the CSS webpage. 
 One of Maestre and Rojas’ mentors is assistant professor of architecture Bhavna Sharma, who has helped and guided them with their project. Sharma said the challenge is to think about an idea and to develop it into a solution that would allow them to work on it over the whole academic year or summer. 
“I think that students are fantastic to work with because they come up with out-of-the-box solutions to grand challenges,” Sharma said.
Sharma encourages students to apply for the program. 
 “To think big and to come up with ideas for solutions or for challenges that they see and even the process of applying for the fellowship is experience,” Sharma said. “So even if they are not to be funded, they should take away that effort as additional skills that they’ve gained.” 
 This year, the fellowship will begin Aug. 16. While the application is currently open only to undergraduate students, Moghaddam said they hope to expand in the near future.
 “We felt that to kickstart the program, we first want to make sure that the undergraduates are involved as well,” Moghaddam said. “So once we have that mechanism going, then in future years we would absolutely like to expand the program to graduate students as well.”

Black TikTok creators are going on strike. 
As they should. For as long as I’ve been on TikTok — which has been a couple of years — I’ve seen white content creators steal the dance moves and punchlines of Black creators and give them no credit. It’s just like the film, “Bring It On,” but digital. Before I dig into this strike, though, let me explain the many times Black creators haven’t been given their flowers.
One of the most well-known examples of this is the famous TikTok dance trend, the Renegade. Back in late September 2019, Jalaiah Harmon posted her choreography to the song “Lottery” by K CAMP to her followers on Instagram. By October, the dance made its way to TikTok, became a viral hit and was being performed by white TikTok stars like Charlie D’Amelio and Addison Rae without credit to Harmon. 
It wasn’t until around the 2020 NBA All-Star Game when Harmon got her much-needed credit. Why? Because D’Amelio, Rae and other white TikTok influencers were invited to the game to perform “The Renegade,” without Harmon. This made the internet, as well as the dance’s originator, upset — and for good reason. 
White creators gained fame off a dance they never created, while the true originator was left in the shadows.
“I was upset. It wasn’t fair,” she said in an interview with the New York Times. “I was happy when I saw my dance all over, but I wanted credit for it.”
After the internet exploded and came to Harmon’s defense, she received an invite to the All-Star Game. Soon after, D’Amelio and Rae posted a TikTok doing the dance with Harmon, which only looked like an attempt to make amends after the virtual backlash. 
But, in reality, white creators “unknowingly” taking content from smaller Black creators without credit isn’t that wild, especially when there have been instances handled a lot worse.
Popular creator Kane Trujillo, known currently as @kane on TikTok but formerly as @neumane, was making comedy videos on the app that averaged at least a million views on each video. His most popular videos used the song, “Triple S” by YN Jay and Louie Ray, which now most people associate with his face.
While the trend was admittedly funny, it wasn’t until Black TikTok creator Joey Bailey posted a side-by-side video of Trujillo’s skits with a compilation of the original skits from various smaller creators … all stolen by Trujillo of course. 
After Bailey posted the TikTok about how his content, as well as many others, was being recreated without credit, Trujillo asked for the video to be taken down. When it wasn’t, he said he would be proceeding with a False Accusation lawsuit. 
These seemed like pretty extreme measures when all he had to do was own up and give credit. But it doesn’t quite end there. When confronted about the content he stole in a livestream, Trujillo attributed his success to being a good actor.
“Who gives a f*ck about some little copied content? Like I’m an actor, I’m not a writer. ” Trujillo said. “I’m not a f*cking storyteller. You give me a script, I will f*cking nail that sh*t. And I’m not gonna think of it, no, but I’m gonna make yours better.”
That was a bit harsh and sort of shows him owning up to his content stealing. Sort of.
Back to the strike.
The song “Thot Sh*t” by Megan Thee Stallion has made its way over to TikTok, much like many of her songs that create viral dance trends. But, this time, there’s no dance because Black creators are refusing to create choreography. This is in an effort to prevent their dances from being stolen and popularized by white creators. 
As of now, the most this song has been used for on the app is showing white creators rocking back and forth and flipping off the camera. The response to this has been hilarious to say the least. Black creators have satirized the videos’ lack of dance, and there’s even a video where creator Erick Louis acts like he’s creating a dance but then flips off the camera and text reading, “Sike. This app would be nothing without [Black] people” appears on screen. 
I think this strike is genius. TikTok has apologized to its Black creators and viewers “who have felt unsafe, unsupported, or suppressed” in the past, but even then, there are situations like the Renegade fiasco and Kane Trujillo that make it seem like the complete opposite. 
With the lack of choreography to Meg’s song, this strike proves that Black creators significantly influence what becomes popular on the app. In the end, just give credit where credit is due, and in the style of Nicki Minaj, “it’s quiet ain’t no back [tok].” 
Side note: I think it’s particularly funny that the song literally says “Hands on my knees, shakin’ a** on my thot sh*t,” and none of the white creators are doing that. The song has directions.

Since she can remember, Poland-born musician Ania Thomas has been magnetically drawn to rock music. Mesmerised by the passion with which artists like Van Halen played, she became unable to take her eyes off the guitar. 
“Every time I saw someone play,” she said, “It was calling my name.” 
So, as the guitar called her name, she answered eagerly.
Now a seasoned guitarist, her body of work leaves listeners wondering what she can’t do as she shreds on the guitar with ease. Best demonstrated by her 2019 collaboration with Dutch guitar pick company ChickenPicks, Thomas composed and performed a piece that brings her abilities to the forefront. Opened by the pounding of drums, the scattered fragments of a guitar join the lone instrument with a sense of immediacy and power. It’s dark, it’s intense, it’s epic — leaving the listener feeling like they’ve walked into a battle against the final boss. 
In addition to her original work, Thomas creates bite-sized guitar covers, putting her own creative spin on everything from Metallica’s “Seek & Destroy” to Doja Cat’s “Like That.” She’s versatile and capable — and she’s only getting started.
A 2019 alumna of the Thornton School of Music majoring in studio guitar, the artist would close out her final year with the completion of her EP “Ania in Chains.” Her first EP, it was recorded entirely on campus with the help of other Thornton-based musicians. 
“That EP is not just one sound, it’s everything I was inspired by. Some of it is more rock, there’s more of an indie-rock track on there, [and a] dark indie pop song,” Thomas said. “Going to music school at USC has taught me to extend my borders and try different genres of music.” 
The EP features the dark-pop song “Poison,” a track accompanied by a psychedelic, daydream-esque music video. At the forefront of the track is the dynamic between Thomas’ siren-like vocals — smooth, graceful and haunting — and her gritty and powerful guitar playing, which together culminate into a raw yet beautiful display of emotion.
The recent project, recorded in 2019 and released in the following year, would be released in the middle of a global pandemic — unknown to her and the rest of the world at the time. However, the timing of the release wasn’t completely discouraging. 
“I don’t think [the pandemic] affected the release of anything.” Thomas said. “It actually helped in a way – people were at home listening, they had nothing to do.”
While listeners were able to pick up new music just as they had before the pandemic, creating new music wouldn’t come as easily to musicians like Thomas. 
“Being a musician is like training for the Olympics — you have to [practice] everyday,” Thomas said. “During the pandemic there was a dark time where … it was hard for [me and my musician friends] to stay on top of it because, if there’s no gigs coming up, what are we training for?” 
In face of a pandemic, the multi-talented artist wouldn’t be pinned down for too long. Determined and unquestionably hard working, Thomas didn’t sit still, choosing to navigate the difficult position by channeling her creative energy into an alternative outlet: songwriting.
“I think [the pandemic] pushed me toward writing a lot,” Thomas said. “I was very creative, and I tried to write and push boundaries.” 
Resilient, defying the odds, persisting despite the unexpected — it comes as anything but unfamiliar to Thomas. One of the few women in her major during her time at USC, the guitarist rose above the expectations placed upon her on the basis of gender. 
“Being a female, we have to deal with the judgement and stereotypes that come about us in the workforce,” said Thomas. “Unfortunately, the way it is in music and rock music, it’s always been a male dominant lead industry, and you always have to prove yourself. A lot of people will put you down and test you and challenge you, but you have to know how to keep it to yourself and not take it personally … Sometimes women have to go outside, even deeper.” 
She wanted to be known as more than “just the girl that plays guitar”— she wanted to be known by her colleagues as a guitarist and a capable one. She pushed herself, putting in hours upon hours to show that, not only was she as capable as the rest of her male classmates, she was a force to be reckoned with. 
Thomas doesn’t shy away from the difficulties she’s faced as a female guitarist — she’s unapologetic, proud and determined to be part of a change in the music industry. 
Whether she’s using her social media platform to dispel stereotypes about women guitarists and encourage aspiring female musicians, or performing at and managing the social media of Gritty in Pink, an all-girl concert series featuring female musicians from the Los Angeles area, Thomas takes the pursuit of equality within the music industry to heart.
“She takes a lot of inspiration from female-fronted rock bands,” said Mica Nafshun-Bone, Thomas’ colleague and fellow Thornton alumna. “She’s all about bringing girls to the forefront of the music industry … She’s kind of a feminist icon.”
Nafshun-Bone’s admiration for the guitarist can be traced back to one of their first encounters.
“She [was] in the sound booth behind the board,” Nafshun-Bone said. “Normally, you’d find a bunch of dudes behind the board, but she was one of the only few females behind the board. I thought that was super badass.”
Being one of the few women behind the board hasn’t always come with ease, but Thomas has stayed true to herself; she doesn’t bend to the words of others, letting confidence, kindness and hard work guide her. This authenticity is what makes her unique, both as an artist and colleague, said Marty Cooper, a 2020 graduate.
“I think that there are a lot of people in the music industry that will put up a front,” Cooper said. “But Ania’s never been the type to do that. She’s always been 100% doing her own thing.”  
As her colleagues, professors and peers will attest to, Thomas is a trailblazer, paving a path for female musicians of the future to follow.  
“In the end, you know, trusting your senses and your instincts and, you know, doing the best you can and really pushing yourself forward has really taught me [everything].” Thomas said. “You have to put in the work for anything you do.”

July is National Ice Cream Month, and what better way to celebrate than exploring new ice cream spots? The Daily Trojan shares a selection of ice cream shops in Los Angeles that are on our must-visit list: 
Wanderlust Creamery 
Earlier this year, CNN Philippines reported on this Instagram-worthy shop, praising co-founders Adrienne Borlongan and Jon-Patrick Lopez for catering to Asian immigrant communities with a variety of nostalgic flavors, including the Southeast Asia-inspired Pandan Tres Leches and an aesthetically pleasing Ube Malted Crunch. Made with malted milk and crunchy malt pieces in addition to purple yams, the latter is Borlongan’s personal take on traditional ube ice cream. Borlongan writes that there’s a meaning behind these choices — she didn’t want to replicate simply another popular ube flavor. Instead, the Ube Malted Crunch is uniquely inspired by her Filipinx American upbringing and identity. 
Wanderlust Creamery has five regular locations throughout L.A., and on Sundays can be found at the Smorgasburg food market in Downtown LA. 
Mateo’s Ice Cream & Fruit Bars
The late Priciliano Mateo founded Mateo’s Ice Cream & Fruit Bars back in 1982. According to its website, Mateo’s has served generations since then with its brightly colored traditional Mexican delicacies inspired by Mateo’s Oaxacan heritage. Ice cream flavors include mamey and horchata ‘n walnuts, but aside from ice cream, Mateo’s also offers fruit popsicles (made entirely from fruit) and chocolate-covered bananas. Yelp reviewer Mike M. writes that Mateo’s is a “must try” for all who live in L.A. Don’t just take Mike’s word for it, though: the establishment has nearly five stars on Yelp with 450+ reviews. 
King Kone
This family-owned ice cream truck has made an appearance in the Los Angeles Times’s list supporting Black-owned businesses in LA and, according to King Kone’s website, they’re the “BEST Ice Cream Delivery truck service period.” Instead of traveling low and far to find them, King Kone comes to you for all your personal ice cream needs. 
The most noteworthy dessert here is, unsurprisingly, the King Kone. It’s a creamy customizable ice cream sundae with your choice of strawberry, caramel or chocolate sauce plus peanuts and whipped cream. If you’re in the mood for something lighter, try a root beer float for some childhood nostalgia or a simple soft-serve in a cup or cone. Their catering services are a hit with large events and can be located on their website.
SomiSomi 
This Korean ice cream chain may not be local to L.A., but its Koreatown location was featured in a Buzzfeed video with legendary K-pop star and L.A. resident Tiffany Young, which makes it a Los Angeles staple in its own right. SomiSomi’s signature dessert is the Ah-Boong, which consists of a taiyaki (fish-shaped bun) with filling and ice cream either on top of or below the taiyaki. Fillings range from custard to Nutella. 
While ice cream flavors vary from location to location, they generally include matcha, oreo and milk. With multiple locations within a short distance from USC, SomiSomi is a “filling” ice cream (get it?) for students on a hot day. 
P.S., Young ordered the Black Sesame ice cream with pink sprinkles.
Holy Roly
The name’s a fun homage to their Thai-inspired rolled ice cream, but their ice creams are the real stars of the show. Each order comes with a toasted marshmallow and a variety of toppings that make the end result a delight to look at. Not to mention, it’s extremely fun seeing your ice cream transform in front of your eyes. Holy Roly has locations in Melrose and Koreatown, L.A. and is also available to order online. 
Creamalicious 
“There’s no ice cream on the market like Creamalicious at all,” says Creamalicious founder Chef Liz Rogers. A tribute to Southern favorites, Creamalicious celebrates Rogers’s roots and community and is inspired by family recipes that have been passed down for generations. Flavors include the pastry-inspired Porch Light Peach Cobbler, Grandma Gigi’s Sweet Potato Pie and Right as Rain Red Velvet Cheesecake. 
As the only Black-owned national ice cream brand, Creamalicious makes it a point to collaborate with businesses owned by women and people of color, according to its website. The brand has received features in KTLA, Black Enterprise, Southern Living and more. Pints can be found at participating Walmarts, Meijers, Schnucks and Jungle Jim’s. 
MILK+T
It’s true that MILK+T is more known for its titular milk tea than its ice cream. Yet, it would be remiss to not include MILK+T on this list, as one of the major specialties on the menu is milk tea with a side of ice cream. Starting in 2015 as a boba truck, they first opened as a store in nearby Little Tokyo, which remains the flagship shop and only location in Los Angeles. The Little Tokyo menu features 10 different ice cream drinks called the Sip N’Dip. Go on a “Guilt Trip” with vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzles, or reach for the “Top Shelf” for coffee ice cream paired with black milk tea. If you’re in the mood for some “Bad Bunny,” opt for a purple drink with ube, taro root and cookies and cream ice cream. It’s the best of both worlds at MILK+T when milk tea meets ice cream!
Van Leeuwen Ice Cream
While Van Leeuwen Ice Cream originally began in New York as a scoop truck, it’s since become a nationwide ice cream staple. Founders Ben, Pete and Laura Van Leeuwen have brought the company all over the United States from Houston, Texas to Los Angeles, California. Van Leeuwen Ice Cream has also made the rounds in many lists, getting positive features in publications like Thrillist, Red Tricycle and Discover Los Angeles.
Vegan ice cream is what’s (paradoxically) hot here. The Van Leeuwens pride themselves on a commitment to simple ingredients, but that doesn’t mean their flavors have to be. Brownie Sundae Raspberry Swirl, Oat Milk Brown Sugar Chunk and Cookie Crumble Strawberry Jam are just some of the flavors available on their extensive list.

Gaining half a million TikTok followers is no easy feat, but USC alumnus and culinary entrepreneur Hwoo Lee is no stranger to rapid social media success. Despite TikTok’s abundance of food accounts, Lee’s swift editing style and inimitable humor has launched him into certified TikTok and Instagram stardom. 
“I’m a food content creator, but really I am in a sense an entrepreneur trying to work on many things at once,” Lee said. “ I don’t know if that characterizes entrepreneurs, but I feel as though I am because I am constantly working on things I want.”
Even before his newfound TikTok fame, Lee’s culinary growth strongly intertwined with his time at USC. 
Lee began learning how to cook in summer 2017 when he lived alone in a house near campus. Starting with Gordon Ramsey’s eggs Benedict dish, he continued to practice several different dishes on his own, eventually refining his palette and improving his flavors. 
“I was also more thoughtful about what I was eating,” Lee said. “[I was beginning to identify] when you’re eating pasta … that taste, that spice, is from the chili flakes you put in or something.” 
Lee was becoming more aware of the process and components of cooking.
Midway through his junior year, Lee learned about Paladar, an underground supper club at USC that began in 2009 and hosted people in an apartment like a restaurant. Paladar — which is a Cuban term for a restaurant run out of a private home. Paladar even has its own documentary. 
This was where everything changed for the young chef. 
“I watched that documentary and I was like, ‘Let me take a stab at this. Why not? I mean, I want to have people over at my place, just have an excuse for friends to come over,’” Lee said. “So, as I was thinking more about how I can have people over, every single time I invited someone I would just text people, make a group chat. And I’d make some dishes for a family style meal.” 
Inspired by this past history of supper club in the USC community, Lee continued hosting during the school year, always trying to create new dishes. 
“Maru started out of my college apartment because I kind of wanted to just brand something out of what I was doing,” Lee said. “I didn’t think of it as anything special … I kind of made it Instagram official, so I would sell spots to my dinner table on Instagram around late 2018.
[The name Maru] directly translates to ‘wooden floors’ in Korean … but it actually alludes to the living room area where the family gathers for games, meals, movies, etc. It’s the gathering space for people in a home.”  
Following graduation, Lee went to stage, an unpaid internship position for chefs where he was volunteering time at Los Angeles Michelin restaurant Kato to learn about the restaurant industry. After staging, Lee did some traveling for the summer, and when he returned to L.A., a co-chef and then-current USC student asked if Lee wanted to host dinners at his fraternity house instead. Lee agreed, and Maru officially began. 
After successfully hosting several dinner events in the fall of 2019, Lee began working as an assistant for a wedding planner while developing Maru within the fraternity house. With research and help from several friends and culinary peers, Lee and his team set up the “fine dining Maru’’ experience.
Hwoo emphasized how important it was to have all the guests be comfortable and build a dynamic social dynamic between each course of the Maru dinner. Hosts would even come up with questions to ask at the dinner table. One of the most popular questions was to tell your first kiss story as such questions broke down barriers.
Maru’s original hostess and fellow USC alumna, Mara Lorin, said first kiss stories were her favorite question to ask. “Everyone would get giddy and it would just open up a wave of awkward teenage emotions,” Lorin said. 
Until USC campus closed due to the coronavirus, Lee led a team of mostly USC undergraduates to operate Maru — six people working in the kitchen, eight hosts and even photographers. 
Ryan Hosey, an alumnus and co-chef at Maru had high praise for Lee. 
“He’s one of the most driven and conceptually talented people that I’ve ever met, especially at our age, being able to have a vision of something that could seem so outlandish. He not only comes up with where he wants to be, he comes up with the individual steps of how he wants to get there. And that’s a super invaluable, impressive trait to have.”
Unfortunately, like other culinary businesses, Maru came to a halt during the pandemic. 
Lee had to stop hosting his dinners and shifted to working full time for his event planning boss, Kevin. Lee started doing cooking classes on the side for charity during the coronavirus in an attempt to give back and continue doing something food related. It wasn’t until mid-December of 2020 that Lee posted a TikTok video cooking a Wagyu steak with pomme purée and Bordelaise sauce for himself that went viral and changed everything.
After his first viral video, with the support of friends and family, Lee focused more on creating online food content. 
“When I first started content creation, I experienced a lot of pressure. I still experience the pressure, but it’s far less than what I was experiencing a couple months ago. ” Lee said. “Some people are very good for it, and some people would crumble under the social pressure and all the judgment. I very much enjoy it. If — back in December — if I could tell myself ‘Should I post this video or not?,’ I would have still said yes. I’ve made so many connections.” 
Social media has also allowed Lee to continue cooking and exploring his own culinary style more in depth. 
“I’ve just started doing something I love. And, really, the biggest thing is that, during COVID, I kind of lost hope for doing my dinners again, and trying to be a cook again,” Lee said. “But doing social media now … I have hope again, for what I want to do … People are interested in my story.”
Lee’s TikTok bio reads “i like to go fast” and his videos are a testament to this statement, showcasing mouth-watering dishes cooked in a speedy clip compilation style. 
There’s an intimate style to these videos as well, as most are created right in Lee’s apartment. Lee’s subtle humor often sneaks into amusing captions and comments among his videos, delighting audiences. 
In addition to generating high-quality content, Lee engages with his viewers by hosting food debates on his Instagram. Hwoo takes a poll and poses fun questions ranging from whether people pour milk before cereal or cereal before milk or if a hot dog is considered a sandwich. People respond to Lee’s Instagram story and he then compiles the data as well as prepares a short speech on his take on the topic. 
Lee also has a section on his TikTok called “People as Food.” He uses it to create a dish that embodies someone he respects. The first edition of this segment featured legendary electronic music producer and singer ZHU, who Lee thought of as squid ink bao buns with calamari.
With a constantly-growing social media presence and a refined talent for culinary arts, it’s no secret that the future is bright for chef Hwoo Lee. 
“I look forward to reopening my supper club in L.A. To people in L.A. or people that come to visit L.A., I’d love to have them and try to continue what I do,” Lee said.“If anything, I’m incredibly grateful for this reinvigorated hope to do what I love again.

During a high school dance, a student at the Pingry School in New Jersey approached the DJ and requested the song “Phoenix.”
As the crowd sang along to the lyrics, which croon, “It’s like I am a phoenix / I know I can do this / And I’m burning my path every day / You can’t hold me down,” Melissa Tungare stood, shocked to hear the words of their song being embraced by others.
“I was actually so excited because hearing someone else sing back your own song to you is maybe like the best feeling of writing a song,” said Tungare, a rising senior majoring in linguistics and East Asian languages and cultures. “Because it’s not only like this person enjoyed it, but this person enjoyed it enough to learn it.”
“Phoenix’s” vast popularity marked a milestone in achievement for Tungare, whose love of music began at a young age. And while “Phoenix,” which was voted as the senior class’ favorite song, might have signaled Tungare as a promising musician, it wasn’t their first foray into songwriting.
That began at six years old with a four-word song addressing school bullies. Tungare had penned the lyrics on a paper they later cathartically crumbled up and put in their backpack. After Tungare’s brother and cousin found the song and later teased them about it, the singer-songwriter stood proud of what they had done.
“Even then, I really used [music] as an outlet [for] the things I felt were harder to talk about,” Tungare said.
Tungare’s songwriting hails from their personal experiences, a move done to base the lyrics on authentic and genuine understandings they know best.
“It really comes from their heart, and they put so much into it,” said Lexi Brauer, a rising senior majoring in economics at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s all very personal and very thoughtful. It’s almost a diary, but in the form of a song.”
Brauer, who has known Tungare for 13 years, recalls their early enthusiasm for singing, such as when Tungare organized a faux “American Idol” contest in honor of the Winter Olympics in fourth grade.
“I feel like I had so many conversations with them about music. And [Melissa] was always teaching me more about it because I didn’t know anything about it,” Brauer said. “They’ll send me the songs constantly, at very weird hours of the night, and then I’ll wake up to it and listen, and they’re always incredible. And I’m very honored that I’m one of the people who get to hear them first.”
While Brauer describes Tungare’s singing as calming, serene and “a great escape,” their long-time music teacher and one of their musical inspirations, Jini June, says it is like “a trip to the moon” because there is no one on earth that sounds like them.
June and Tungare have been working together ever since Tungare was 10 and a half years old. June has enjoyed watching them blossom the past decade, particularly seeing their confidence and fearlessness grow throughout the years.
Both June and Tungare are of Indian descent, a connection that has strengthened their bond in the time they have known each other. Their lessons were broken down into two-parts, with the first half of dialogue discussing what it is like to be South Asian in the music industry and the other half being educational instruction. 
After every lesson, June always found it hard to leave Tungare’s house.
“I don’t have kids, but I look at these students, especially Melissa, as my little [siblings],” June said. “I wish that I had a teacher who looked like me when I was coming up because then it would have kind of given me a little bit more of a passport to follow my dreams.”
For June, seeing Tungare rise as an upcoming artist is a testament to their perseverance in a world riddled with judgment and hate and a lack of South Asian representation in the entertainment industry. 
“You have to have rhino skin to get over that and rise above that. And yet, they still write, and they still do covers and put them out there,” June said. “They put a lot of thought into what they do. But I’m really happy that they continued, especially with the songwriting.”
June said Tungare is following their dreams with all heart and no fear, and she said that’s what she “would like to see the next generation of South Asians [do.]” And while June has taught Tungare all about piano and songwriting, ultimately, June said Tungare has natural gifts that cannot be shown in textbooks. 
“First of all, to write a hit song or to write a great song, you don’t go to school for that. You just write and it comes from your own inspiration. And you don’t go to school for inspiration,” June said. “You don’t get those kinds of ideas to write a song from taking a degree in music. There are other things you can learn with a music degree, but writing a good song is something that comes 100% from within.”
Tungare said June encouraged them to explore their own potential; one of their most prized possessions is a notebook June gifted to them. Now, it has been completely filled with song lyrics and other musings. 
Besides songwriting, Tungare has also dabbled in musical theatre and classical piano. While at USC, they made the decision not to pursue a major or minor in music to avoid eclipsing academics with something they love.
Instead, they pursued music on the side, joining Asli Baat, USC’s South Asian Fusion A Cappella group, releasing covers of songs on social media and creating snippets of original compositions on their phone’s voice recordings.
“Often when I’m writing, there’s a moment where I’ll play back the recording of what I just did,” Tungare said. “And this is more of a personal thing, but I’ll just be so excited all of a sudden, and it’s just a feeling of like, ‘Wait, I just wrote that.’ It’s a really exciting moment for me.”
In the future, Tungare hopes to publish their music on Spotify and release an album filled with unreleased personal songs that Tungare describes as more “raw.”
“It would be quite an experience to let people hear that and see that side of me, so I think that those are probably the ones that cut the deepest,” Tungare said. “I think that the [songs] that I released are definitely ones that kind of show who I want to be rather than who I already am.”

Reproduction has been historically perceived as a “women’s issue.” From healthcare to gender norms to reproductive politics, men’s reproductive health deserves to be spotlighted in a disparate society where we continue to overlook a vital piece of the infertility puzzle: sperm.
The sperm count “crisis” warns that falling sperm counts are a threat to the future of humankind; however, scientists fail to consider alternative explanations for the apparent link between low sperm count and fertility. While sperm count is important, it may not be the defining predictor of fertility — we need to take a look at sperm health.
Male infertility contributes to about one-third of infertility cases worldwide, but women have shouldered the blame for the inability to conceive. With the rise of reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization, women’s bodies have become meticulously targeted and used as guinea pigs for frontline treatments to treat any male factor fertility problem. 
We see a common pattern of women being warned to watch out for their daily diet as well as smoking and drinking habits for the sake of their reproductive health but never the same precaution for men. Lifestyle choices such as alcohol and drug use can damage sperm and lower sperm numbers. Recent research shows that men’s health before conception can damage sperm and result in pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, birth defects and childhood illnesses. 
The impact of reproductive toxins on male infertility also deserves further investigation. Environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors, a class of hormone-mimicking chemicals commonly found in everyday toiletry products, was found to decrease the quality and motility of sperm — these dangerous threats to reproductive health can be recognized and prevented.
Rene Almeling, a sociologist of medicine and author of “GUYnecology: The Missing Science of Men’s Reproductive Health,” argues that science still lacks basic knowledge when it comes to sperm. In medicine, there are two large specialities dedicated to women’s reproductive health — obstetrics and gynecology — with no comparable specialty for men’s reproductive health. 
If we continue to focus only on women’s health, we are neglecting the reproductive risk associated with men’s bodies and perpetuating unfair gender norms that surround reproductive politics. The implicit association of reproductive health with women’s health memorializes the message that reproduction is still just a women’s issue. This conflation does a disservice to women and widens the knowledge gap for couples who wish to conceive. 
The absence of a male birth control pill illuminates the need to revisit an important research agenda: alternative male contraceptive options. The fact that females bear most of the financial and health-related burden for contraception is unfair; there is an abundance of fertility treatments available for women while condoms and vasectomy are the only two male birth control options. It is worth continuing the effort to understand male infertility and move toward shared contraceptive responsibility.
We see a rise in women’s health campaigns led by organizations such as American Women Medical Student Association but a serious lack of discussion on men’s health. Men’s health needs to be incorporated in fertility summits to empower men’s understanding and control over their own reproductive health. Hospitals should promote infographics and offer resources on men’s health — taking care of your reproductive health should become normalized for men.
It is now more important than ever to educate young boys and men about their reproductive health, including how lifestyle choices and environment can affect the condition of their sperm and, in turn, their future children’s health. Teachers should implement curriculum on men’s reproductive health in health classes and sex education, broadening the discussion about men’s health. 
Men’s reproductive health isn’t about devaluing women’s health. It’s about healthcare equity and closing the knowledge gap in reproductive medicine.

In the wise words of comedian Bo Burnham “Is it necessary that every single person on this planet, um, expresses every single opinion that they have on every single thing that occurs all at the same time? Is that, is that necessary? Um, Or to ask in a slightly different way, um, can, can anyone shut the fuck up?” 
In this final issue of the Summer Trojan and my final issue as opinion section editor, I’d like to say that, while opinions can be important, this emergent trend of having an opinion on everything is an insidious moral cancer to the world. 
On their own, opinions mean nothing. Say it with me, having an opinion on something means little to nothing. Maybe an opinion can lead to something (and I mean something in the vaguest way possible because they don’t always lead to the betterment of society), but having an opinion on something makes you no different than any other random person who likely also can have an opinion on something. 
That being said, I find it weird that we praise people for their opinions and reprimand them for not having any. There are three main reasons why I think that and, ironically, here is my opinion on opinions. 
First of all, I think that the expectation to be informed and proactive about every social issue diminishes the amount of good an individual is actually able to accomplish in the world. In a world rife with chaos, confusion and uncertainty, you are not going to harmonize all of it with one swift wave of your hands. 
Your energy is best spent at work on something that you can actually improve. I’m not saying not to do what you can when you can, but I am saying that if you have a limited amount of resources that you can allocate to doing good (which, shocker, we all do), then maybe you should focus the majority of it on a handful of causes consistently. Pick a target, and aim at it as opposed to aimlessly shooting your efforts everywhere.  
You know about the dangers of performative activism, and while a lot of it can be attributed to some weird virtue signaling ego-trip, a lot of it can also be attributed to the new societal expectation that every cause must be your cause to fulfill your moral obligation. This is an impossible standard, and so take it from me, someone who (embarrassingly) prides themselves on their opinions, it is more effective for you to not have an opinion on every single thing that happens. Get good at knowing about one or two things and go from there. 
A second reason why having an opinion on everything is bad is because it encourages the spread of misinformation. In this era where we have access to information on every injustice happening on every square inch of the globe, we are quick to conflate this ability to access information with the ability to understand and truly reckon with it. While we may be technically able to learn about every issue that plagues the world, that does not mean that we are mentally able to grapple with every one of these issues. However, insomuch as society ascribes these very kinds of impossible levels of pondering as a moral standard, those wishing to reach these standards will be more likely to blindly accept the opinions of others as their own to fill in their own blanks. We’re so quick to blame big tech for the way that misinformation spreads like wildfire, and while I have many bones to pick with big tech, I think the outrage culture that we all cultivate daily by reprimanding each other for not speaking out on everything is something that big tech exploits to promote this misinformation. 
Finally, it’s a privilege to have an opinion on everything. Most people just do not have that kind of time and energy. They have families and responsibilities and their own mental health to worry about. So, once again, I’d like to reiterate that having an opinion on something or not having an opinion on something holds very little moral value. Call me crazy, but if your priorities are putting food on your family’s table and not solving the Israel-Palestine conflict during the week it dominates the news cycle, I wouldn’t call you a bad person.
I’ll end with a more personal observation on having an opinion on everything: It is spiritually exhausting. I think that a lot of religious and spiritual practice tries to warn us of this. They preach non-judgement; they tell us to love our neighbours no matter who they are, etc. I think that somewhere along the line we have forgotten this ancient, hard-earned wisdom. So, I’ll leave you with this Zen parable that may just be my Gen Z coping mechanism in a world that can be caught crumbling in HD with 50 million views on TikTok but that has nonetheless helped me combat anxiety and spiritual exhaustion:
“There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. ‘Such bad luck,’ they said sympathetically. ‘May be,’ the farmer replied.
The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. ‘How wonderful,’ the neighbors exclaimed. ‘May be,’ replied the old man.
The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune. ‘May be,’ answered the farmer.
The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son’s leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out. ‘May be,’ said the farmer.”
It can be hard to know good from bad, so just do your best and take care of yourself out there.
