The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary on Monday, May 21. 
Crimes against a person
At 9:38 p.m., a student reported that a suspect pushed her off her skateboard as she rode past him and a second suspect near Adams and Figueroa. He attempted to grab hold of her as she lay on the ground. The student then punched the suspect in the groin and fled on foot. The suspects did not pursue her. The student did not report the incident at the time it occurred, so DPS officers were unable to conduct a search for the suspects.
At 9:13 p.M., a non-USC male reported that someone has been tampering with his mail at the University Gatway Apartments and he believes his roommate, a student, is responsible.
At 9:14 a.M., a staff member reported that a student was verbally abusive and disrespectful toward him at the Keith Administration Building.
Crimes against property
At 6:15 p.m., DPS officers on routine patrol observed a locked bicycle in the bed of a truck at Del Taco that was empty a short time earlier when it was spotted in an alley on 28th Street and detained the driver for investigation.  The suspect claimed he found the bike, but it was registered to a student. When the officers contacted her she said no one had permission to remove it.  The student did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter, so the suspect was released and the bike was impounded at the DPS office for her to claim it.
At 12:01 p.m., a suspect smashed the front passenger side window to gain entry and removed a book bag from a car parked at Soto Street and Valley Boulevard.
at 11:20 a.m., a staff member who works inside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center deli reported that he observed a suspect place an order of food in a bag she was carrying and exit the store without paying for it. The staff member also said there have been multiple incidents involving the same suspect during the past several weeks. DPS officers conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspect.
 
Miscellaneous incidents
At 2:30 p.M., DPS officers responded to a report of a male screaming inside an apartment at Shrine Place. The officers contacted a student in the apartment and he told them he had been arguing with his ex-girlfriend on the phone.  The student did not require any assistance and the officers cleared the scene.
At 1:51 p.m., DPS officers responded to a staff member who sustained a cut to her forehead when she tripped and fell while walking near the Bovard Administration building. An LAFD RA unit was responded.  The RA Unit treated the staff member and she was released to the officers. They transported her to SHC for additional medical treatment.
“At 9:14 a.M., a staff member reported that a student was verbally abusive and disrespectful toward him at the Keith Administration Building.”
Grow some balls bro. “Oh my god, he was MEAN to me, officers please catch him!” is a pretty pathetic way to live.
Jack,
You sound like a bully!
Nice start to the summer crime.  We are just missing drunk girl stories.

Sixteen USC football players returned last week from a trip to Haiti to build four houses for victims who were devastated by the effects of the 2010 earthquake.

Les Barkley, quarterback Matt Barkley’s father, organized the trip and had been to Haiti several times before. As a volunteer at Hope Force International, a non-profit Christian-based organization that specializes in quick-strike disaster relief, Les Barkley first went to Haiti in 2010 when he led a team of doctors, medics and trauma nurses down to offer relief.
The Barkley family has a tradition of taking mission trips. But with Matt Barkley’s tight schedule, between summer school and football training, they found only a one-week window.
Les Barkley suggested going to Haiti, which still faces the effects of the earthquake.
Matt loved the idea, but had a question for his dad.
“‘Would it be OK if a couple of teammates came with us?’” Les Barkley said his son asked.
The roster for the trip included captains and senior leaders safety T.J. McDonald, Matt Barkley, center Khaled Holmes, defensive end Devon Kennard and junior punter Kyle Negrete.
In Haiti, the team worked to build four homes for families in need, participate in food distribution in outlying communities and transport and distribute supplies and necessities to local schools and orphanages.
Cyrus Hobbi, an offensive lineman, said that he gained a new perspective through his experience in Haiti.
“It was really just a humbling experience,” Hobbi said. “It was weird coming back [to the] A.C. and a nice comfy bed to sleep in.”
Les Barkley credits the Trojan Family with helping the team raise money for the team to take the trip.
“Virtually all of the funds came through the Trojan Family,” Les Barkley said.
Les Barkley said to the USC Athletics website helped generate word of mouth for the cause.
“When Trojan alumni heard what their team was doing, I got calls saying ‘Hey can I help? How can I support this effort?’” Les Barkley said.
Kennard said the trip helped develop stronger relationships between the players.
“We grew together because we had to go out there and work,” Kennard said. “Doing it as a team, made it all the better.”
[…] to a Daily Trojan, Les Barkley suggested going to Haiti. His son Matt desired a thought and asked “‘Would it be […]

President C. L. Max Nikias met with state legislators and government officials in Sacramento last week in his first trip to the state Capitol as president. Nikias traveled with a delegation of university administrators and trustees to discuss issues ranging from the Coliseum to funding for higher education.
A trip to the state Capitol is organized each spring by the USC Office of State Government Relations to allow the university to help shape state policy, particularly issues concerning higher education.
Nikias had not been to Sacramento since 2008, when he was provost, said Adele Wilson, administrative assistant in USC’s Office of State Government Relations.
“He wanted to reconnect with the Sacramento stakeholders and the legislators,” Wilson said.
During the day, Nikias met with Gov. Jerry Brown, Secretary of the State Anna Caballero and Los Angeles legislators, including Assembly member Gil Cedillo. Edward P. Roski Jr., Board of Trustees chairman; Thomas S. Sayles, USC senior vice president for University Relations; and Trustee David Dornsife also held meetings with officials in the capital.
Wilson said the lease agreement between USC and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission was a primary issue on the trip’s agenda.
This transaction will give USC complete control over use of the stadium and the Los Angeles Sports Arena for 20 years and commit the school to paying at least $70 million in stadium renovations.
Brown expressed his support of the lease approval during a meeting, according to a press release.
Wilson said the visit ended with a reception in the evening. About 150 people were in attendance, Wilson said, including several legislators and the secretary of foreign affairs.
Another issue on the trip’s agenda was higher education and funding. According to a press release, Nikias urged Brown to reconsider cutting Cal Grants, which provide financial aid for low-income students. Cal Grants are currently slated for a 44 percent cut in the upcoming budget.
Nikias also discussed The Village at USC project with California legislators and the Keck Hospital of USC.
Chester A. Newland, an emeritus professor of public administration, said in an email that the trip was successful in displaying USC’s leadership.
“Max Nikias’s visit to Sacramento demonstrated USC’s exemplary, broadly inclusive and shared Trojan leadership culture,” Newland said. “[The meeting worked] to promote understanding of the university’s sustained commitment to [the] vital interests of California and to advanced-knowledge civilization, locally to globally.”

Ralph Fertig, a clinical professor of social work, has a history of working for civil rights. As a new member of the City of Los Angeles’ Ethics Commission, he will now use his moral compass to guide elections.
“This very much integrates with what I’m teaching and studying, which is public policy,” Fertig said. “It’s very fundamental that both local and national concerns are only addressed in adherence to a code of ethics.”

He was unanimously confirmed last week to the commission, which oversees campaign finance and lobbying laws for city officials. He said his belief in transparency and equality in democratic elections will guide his decisions.
“The funding of campaigns and the relationship between vested interests and the record of [a] candidate or incumbent need to be in the light of day,” Fertig said.
Fertig was instilled with a sense of ethics from a young age. After his parents fled European fascism, refugees from World War II would stay in his family’s apartment in Chicago.
“I grew up with stories of atrocities from people who had experienced them and I dedicated my life to guaranteeing democratic and ethical principals,” Fertig said. “They assured me of the rights to the people. I was raised on the concept of unalienable rights.”
Fertig has dedicated his life to extending rights to oppressed peoples through nonviolence.
“Along the way we’ve had massive resistance of that extension, calling on people to accept the notion that equality means giving up the monopoly on power. There’s naturally resistance and fear and resentment,” Fertig said. “It’s not a steady outpouring of what’s right, but a battle to get people to give up monopolies on power so it can be shared with the full community.”
While working for Chicago Freedom Action, a civil rights group that worked to overcome racism and discrimination for African Americans, Fertig participated in the Freedom Rides, which tested a Supreme Court decision that made it illegal for cities to enforce local Jim Crow laws for bus riders. This ride was initially set to be called off because of violence from white supremacists who attacked people riding the buses.
“We went to Jackson, Miss. … After many efforts … we found a bus driver to take us,” Fertig said.
[Correction: A previous version of this story said that the bus driver abandoned the bus riders in Selma, Ala. When the bus arrived in Selma, a sheriff arrested Fertig, but the other freedom riders proceeded to Jackson.]
Four years later, a series of marches shifted public opinion toward the civil rights movement but, in 1961, Fertig was arrested [in Selma].”
“The Klu Klux Klan was along the outside and egged on white prisoners to beat me so their white supremacy was espoused,” Fertig said. “They broke every rib in my body and I was rescued from the courthouse by [three] very brave black lawyers.”
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated that two lawyers aided Ralph Fertig. It was three lawyers: Fred Grey, Solomon Seay Jr., and Charles Conelley.]
Now, Fertig is one of four members on an executive committee that supports efforts to investigate murders of civil rights activists in Mississippi.
Fertig said the group continues to meet every Wednesday.
Fertig’s firm commitment to civil rights landed him in front of the Supreme Court two years ago when he challenged the 1996 Patriot Act, which makes it a crime to provide “material support” to a terrorist organization.
[Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Fertig advised the Kurdistan Workers Party. He has advised Kurdish groups and people, but not the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is considered a terrorist organization by the United States.]
“I am seeking a peaceful alternative to the violence that is being dealt upon the Kurds by the Turkish government,” Fertig said. “The Supreme Court said I was doing the exact opposite.”
In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that Fertig could not advise the Kurdistan Workers Party because national security was threatened.
He said this doesn’t discourage him, but encourages him to find other ways to help the Kurds.
“That’s all the more reason to become engaged in political alternatives,” Fertig said.
In addition to his teaching and activism, Fertig wrote a Los Angeles Times bestseller in 2001 about Jewish liberation from ghettos during Napoleonic era.
“My novel incorporates the details of racism and confinement, seen through the eyes of people,” Fertig said. “It is largely fictionalized — the historical details are accurate and the historical figures are accurate and saying things they said — but the point is that you can never be liberated without love and you cannot love without liberation.”
He said that the civil rights of nonviolence and love are the keystones to all of his work.
“I don’t think that one can be a professor of social work without being an humanitarian. Social work is the humanitarian profession,” Fertig said. “It is the one profession that exists for the purpose of securing rights and respect and equal opportunities for all peoples.”
He is a national treasure.

Two suspects in the fatal shooting of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, graduate students from China, were charged Tuesday with capital murder during a botched robbery, according to a press release from the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office.
Multiple murders and murder during a robbery make the two suspects eligible for the death penalty if prosecutors choose to seek it, the release said.
The arraignment for the two suspects was postponed from Tuesday until June 25, Shiara Dávila-Morales, a spokeswoman at the district attorney’s office, said.
The Los Angeles Police Department arrested the two men Friday afternoon. The suspects, Bryan Barnes, 20, and Javier Bolden, 19, are being held without bail. LAPD Detective David Garrido said Bolden was arrested near Victorville and Barnes was arrested in South Los Angeles.
Ming Qu and Ying Wu, 23-year old electrical engineering students, were fatally shot around 1 a.m. while sitting in Qu’s car on April 11. The incident occurred near the intersection of 27th Street and Raymond Avenue, about three blocks west of Vermont Avenue.
The parents of Qu and Wu filed a lawsuit against USC last week, claiming that the university had intentionally misrepresented the safety of the surrounding area and the safety services that the university provides.
In a statement issued by the university after the arrests, USC President C. L. Max Nikias lauded the city’s efforts in working to find those responsible.
“They shared our outrage at this senseless and singular act and worked passionately to reach a resolution,” Nikias said.
The district attorney’s office said that police used shell casings to connect the suspects to earlier murder attempts. Barnes and Bolden were charged for attempted murder in the alleged shooting at a South Los Angeles party on Dec. 3, 2011.
Officials also believe Barnes fired several rounds at a South Los Angeles party Feb. 12, injuring two victims.
Why weren’t these animals locked up after their previous incidents? Its time we stopped being politically correct and throw criminals in prison. The Black community is rife with crime and is destroying this country.
Why did you mention in the original report that Chinese students were shot, but fail to mention anywhere in this article that the criminals are blacks?

Valentine’s Day, He’s Just Not That Into You and New Year’s Eve have marked a new age in Hollywood filmmaking. Film directors are no longer relying on one protagonist: Stringing together the vignettes of various story lines that share a central theme is the new way to go.
The most recent addition to this ever-expanding group is What To Expect When You’re Expecting.

Loosely based on the eponymous pregnancy guide, What to Expect When You’re Expecting follows five couples during their tumultuous journey of becoming parents. Director Kirk Jones wisely chooses not to closely reproduce the chapters of the best-seller; instead Jones chronicles the stages of pregnancy, adoption and miscarriage.
Jones should be commended for introducing the different routes someone can take into parenthood, but the various plot points steal characters of their would-be depth. The shallow tendencies of the movie can be seen in the pregnancy shared between food truck rivals Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford).
Though a small portion of the film is devoted to Rosie’s struggle as she comes to terms with an unimaginable loss, there is only one moment of genuine heartbreak afforded to her. Rosie briefly verbalizes the trauma she endures, but the emotions she expresses only scratches the surface because of the limited time her story is given.
The downplay of greater issues extends into the marriage of Holly (Jennifer Lopez) and Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) who are preparing their lives for the adoption of a baby. Rather than delving into the subject, the deeper problems are quickly forgotten because of an abrupt transition into the next couple.
This supplements Jones’ unrealistic portrayal of adoption in general by allowing Holly and Alex to receive their baby in a matter of weeks, when they — and most adoptive parents — are initially told it would take at least a year.
Though filmmakers could have really developed and fleshed out the challenging topics, they instead reiterate the cliched gender roles of irresponsible dads and controlling moms found in previous romantic comedies.
Vic (Chris Rock) hosts a “dude’s group” in the park every Saturday that allows other dads to escape their hormonal wives and air their fatherhood grievances while they blatantly ignore their children. As the men push strollers, they knock down Vic’s toddler by throwing beer cans and joke about their kids playing in the dryer.
This misplaced humor and unoriginal perspective leaves the pregnant mothers of the film to make their mark by vomiting at inopportune times or throwing unwarranted temper tantrums.
What to Expect’s superficial perspective of parenthood corresponds to the caliber of actors in the movie. None of the five couples convincingly navigate their relationships, and the biggest culprits are Jules (Cameron Diaz) and Evan (Matthew Morrison). Their scenes are filled with lackluster arguments and insufficient chemistry, illustrating their incompatibility as characters and actors.
Surprisingly — in a cast featuring Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick and seasoned actor Dennis Quaid — Ben Falcone becomes the star of the movie. Falcone recently acted as the forgettable air marshal in Bridesmaids, but here transforms into Gary, an endearing father-to-be.
While his wife Wendy undergoes complications during her delivery, Gary waits paralyzed by fear. His vulnerability as he awaits news about his wife makes him a captivating character and reveals the emotional depth the movie consistently fails to fulfill.
In the end, What to Expect When You’re Expecting has exactly what one would expect from a romantic comedy: mediocre acting with a predictable plot. Jones sets the stage for the movie to surpass those standards, but he limits complex topics to small talk because of the film’s constantly changing focus.

Patience is a virtue, an idea that British band Little Barrie is clearly aware of.
Five years after the 2007 release of its last album, Stand Your Ground, Little Barrie is back with a vengeance. The band released King of the Waves in February and is due to embark on a tour this summer.
Though five years off between albums is considered epic in the music industry, lead singer Barrie Cadogan admits that it’s sometimes necessary.
“We didn’t take five years off by choice. It was a consequence of our circumstances,” Cadogan says. “Writing an album is a longer process when a record label won’t support you anymore and you don’t have the money to rehearse or record whenever you want.”
Unlike artists such as Rihanna who can afford to release an album every year, underground bands like Little Barrie are forced to work with their current conditions.
“It’s obvious Rihanna works extremely hard, but it’s easier to put out an album every year with enough cash behind you that it allows you to not have to do other work to pay your rent,” Cadogan says. “A production schedule doesn’t necessarily hinder talent either. You have to do what you can when you can.”
This pause in production has only helped Little Barrie take more time to cultivate its sound.
Little Barrie’s Wikipedia page refers to its sound as “R&B/Soul/Funk/Blues/Garage rock jamband,” which, is not far off, according to Cadogan.
“I honestly don’t know how to classify our sound,” Cadogan says. “We like the energy of raw blues and rock ‘n’ roll as a live performance, but mixing it with all the music we love: We change what we want to do as we go on, so it’s hard to categorize.”
This refreshing amalgamation of sounds comes to life with help from some of Little Barrie’s trusted co-workers. The band had previously worked with producer Edwyn Collins and engineer Sebastian Lewsley and decided to call on them once again.
“Repetition is not the main aim,” Cadogan says. “We just love working with Edwyn Collins and Seb Lewsley at West Heath Yard. They had the right equipment to capture the sound we wanted.”
The band’s friendly relationship with the two stems from their disillusionment with many current studios.
“We don’t trust a lot of studios and producers,” Cadogan says. “So much record production sounds terrible and boring now. We asked [Collins and Lewsley] to help us and luckily for us they came to our rescue once again.”
As part of a group that flaunts a uniquely British sound, Cadogan admits that it’s sometimes difficult for British bands to break it big in the U.S.
“Definitely one hard fact is for many British bands, starting out touring the States is too expensive,” Cadogan says.
Fortunately, the band has built up their fanbase and are due to continue on a summer tour, stopping in Seattle, Portland, Fort Worth and other cities after playing at The Bootleg in Los Angeles tomorrow.
“We love playing all over the world. We’ve played to some really cool audiences all over. Traveling has been a great part of being in the band,” Cadogan says.
Soon the band will start work on its next batch of songs in hopes of continuing its growing success.
And though some bands wish for the glitz and glamour of being a rock ‘n’ roll band, Little Barrie’s goal is clear.
“We admire people who have stuck to their guns and followed a creative path,” Cadogan said. “We want to keep going, play well and create.”
Little Barrie performs at The Bootleg Thursday.

Beautiful things are best enjoyed in beautiful settings, a concept that the luxurious city of Beverly Hills certainly understands.
Last weekend, Beverly Hills held its biannual art show in the historic Beverly Gardens, located along Santa Monica Boulevard.
State of the Union · The artist Kaleo frequently uses famousfaces as subjects for his fascinating and provcative images. - Brittany La Hue | Summer Trojan 
Formerly called the Affaire in the Gardens, the nearly 40-year-old event traditionally occurs every May and October. This season’s show featured 250 artists exhibiting their work in diverse mediums, such as painting, watercolor, sculpture, photography, ceramics, drawings, printmaking, mixed media and jewelry.
Though the art was beautiful, the helter-skelter layout of the tents, lack of directories and the general confusion of the volunteers and staff who were working the show led to a quite disorganized experience.
“While every artist truly deserved to be there and their art was absolutely amazing, the layout of the show made it hard for the audience to see everything or find anything,” said Lucy Yin, a senior majoring in English Literature.
Luckily, the relaxed vibe of the art fair and the openness of the artists more than made up for the confusion.
Talented USC alumni permeated the tents and viewers learned about the inspiration behind their art as well as experience uncommon types of art.
Dennis Sallas, a UCLA alumnus who goes by the penname “Kaleo,” was a highlight of the festival. His brightly colored canvases featured relevant figures, including President Barack Obama, former presidents Bill Clinton and John F. Kennedy, singer Amy Winehouse and terrorist leader Osama bin Laden against bright backgrounds of Target logos, tabloid headlines and Blow Pop wrappers. The images were not only visually appealing but also thought-provoking with their political insights.
Other forward-thinking artists who exhibited work at the art show included Steve Fujimoto, who uses materials from wood to lights to dollar bills in his sculptures and whose work was showcased in the 2011 Rose Parade.
“These artists approach the Los Angeles environment with joy, irony and the occasionally vicious touch,” said Karen McLean, the show coordinator.
Indeed, tents featured anything from paintings of flowers to raw and eye-opening pictures of Los Angeles’ worst corners and even neon animal sculptures and skulls. The sheer amount of variety and diversity made the Beverly Hills Art Show truly a cultural experience to remember.
“We’re about art. From classic to contemporary, experimental to experiential, we are Southern California’s premier art festival in terms of quality and a push toward the progressive,” McLean said.
But the show wasn’t just about art. Fun attractions included food trucks, beer gardens, outdoor musical performances and areas for children to engage in art projects of their own.
Overall, the free art show’s beautiful and accessible location provided a valuable cultural experience.
“I think everyone should make a trip down there because the people are all so friendly and the art inspiring. … [It was] a great way to spend a Saturday,” Yin said.
The next Beverly Hills Art Show will be held Oct. 20 and 21.

Some summer blockbusters manage to shatter their binding stereotypes and entertain audiences and critics. And despite missteps in performances, storyline or direction, a juggernaut of a summer flick can still fulfill the audience’s desire for fun, mindless entertainment.
Battleship is not one of those films.
In fact, the film exceeds any sort of reasonable threshold of mindlessness that it’s only after 100 minutes — out of a droning two hours — of dismissing, insulting and abandoning the audience’s intellect that the finale is remotely plausible. For a $200-million budget, money clearly went anywhere but toward creating a decent film.
Though Jeremy Renner was once in talks to star, the film rests on the supposedly hunky shoulders of Taylor Kitsch — a poor man’s Josh Duhamel — who was better off as a TV football jock than cutting the figure of a Naval officer worthy of inspiring any kind of confidence.
It’s clear by the production’s original choice of Renner that they were going for a bad-boy-turned-leader, but instead ended up with Kitsch as buffoon-turned-maniac.
Kitsch’s Alex Hopper begins as a reckless slacker hoping to impress Sam (Brooklyn Decker), much to the chagrin of his responsible Navy-commander brother, played by Alexander Skarsgård — whose father Stellan clearly chose the superior blockbuster in The Avengers.
Seven years later — after attempting to trick the audience into believing that a Sports Illustrated cover girl will date you for a chicken burrito and a haircut — Kitsch’s character hardly matures. In fact, his arc stops at a clean shave and a new lieutenant’s uniform.
Hopper gets into a hot-headed fistfight over a soccer game with a Japanese captain, which makes you wonder if they can overcome their differences to fight a different foreign threat. Spoiler alert: They do.
In most action films, characters are saved by the quick thinking actions of a superior. But Battleship isn’t like most action films: There is never a turning point where anything beyond blind luck and near misses save Hopper and his officers, forcing the audience to root for good fortune instead of choices the characters make.
Unfortunately, the stereotypical supporting characters don’t make the film much better. The racist wisecracker proves reliable. The tough sniper girl is tough. Then there’s the veteran with prosthetic legs who has lost his will to fight. Will he regain his courage in the 11th hour?
Even the neurotic techie played by Hamish Linklater — almost a carbon copy of Simon Pegg’s character in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol — wears the glasses and scruff but displays none of the humor or charisma to provide comic relief, only annoyance.
Battleship’s main weakness lies in its refusal to show off more of its strongest actors. Liam Neeson’s Admiral Shane — coincidentally Sam’s father and justifiably disapproving of Hopper — isn’t onscreen nearly long enough. In addition, Skarsgård’s character hardly has enough screentime to warrant a star billing.
At one point, the cutaways from Hopper’s ship to the rest of the naval fleet abruptly stop, as if the screenwriters couldn’t think of a justifiable task for an entire fleet to work toward besides bickering with government suits.
Such ridiculousness reaches its peak when, after all other ships within the force field are destroyed, Hopper gets senior veterans to reactivate the historical USS Missouri, which, overlooking major logical fallacies, tries to be a moment of patriotism and hope but instead rings false. And the beginnings of unity, set to an AC/DC track, have the kind of energy and cohesion that was needed within the first half-hour, not the last.
The purely abysmal plot of the film is further shot down with an attempt by director Peter Berg to recreate the gritty look of one of his Friday Night Lights episodes. Instead, the film would have benefited from the sheen of lens flares and flash of J.J. Abrams or Michael Bay. Even John Woo’s over-the-top style could have distracted better from such poor plotlines.
Rather, the dry cinematography emphasizes the failure of the film to reach higher-end expectations.
Also, the production could, in an attempt to conceive a script from a board game, decide that aliens should come into play is absurd.
The audience knows Hopper and company will defeat the aliens; there isn’t even a smidge of surprise throughout the film. When the protagonists succeed, the victory is obvious and unsatisfying.
Simply, the plot, absurd as it might be, would have been acceptably entertaining had the protagonists been likeable. When Rihanna is the most charismatic actor on the ship, the film is obviously on the wrong track. It’s unfortunate that Kitsch is not strong enough of an actor to carry the film himself.
Hopefully, the film industry doesn’t get anymore board game ideas; one shudders to think what suits over in Hollywood will do one day to Chutes & Ladders.

In ESPN’s third version of its 2012 Way-Too-Early Preseason Top 25 rankings released Friday, sportswriter Mark Schlabach slotted the USC Trojans at No. 2.
USC dropped from its previous spot at No. 1 because of a tougher schedule in comparison to now-No. 1 LSU.
Schlabach specifically cited USC’s tough road matchups against Stanford and Washington and home games against Oregon and Notre Dame as a factor in its drop.
Ahead of the Pac(k) · Sophomore runningback D.J. Morgan (30) is one of several offensive weapons that has USC positioned high in ESPN’s poll. - Corey Marquetti | Summer Trojan
Schlabach noted, however, USC’s strength behind the return of 19 starters, specifically senior quarterback Matt Barkley, who is an early favorite for the Heisman Trophy.
USC’s recruiting class, which features linebacker Jabari Ruffin and receiver Nelson Agholor, also bolstered its ranking as a top team in the nation.
Schlabach did not mention the season-ending knee injury of sophomore tailback Tre Madden on April 6. Madden had showed promise during spring practice and could have been USC’s second-string back behind senior Curtis McNeal.
One area that USC could improve, according to Schlabach, is their defensive line, especially after the departure of defensive end Nick Perry to the pros.
Despite the NCAA sanctions stemming from recruiting violations regarding former running back Reggie Bush, USC finished atop the Pac-12 south division at 10-2 last season.
The Trojans’ season was highlighted by a 38-35 road win over No. 4 Oregon and a 50-0 victory over UCLA in their season finale. USC finished the 2011-12 season ranked No. 6 in the Associated Press Top 25 Poll.
USC was unranked in the Bowl Championship Series standings because of its disqualification from bowl and conference championship games last season.
ESPN’s unofficial Way-Too-Early Preseason rankings were first released Jan. 10, a day after the LSU Tigers defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide in the BCS Championship Game.
Other Pac-12 teams in the latest edition of the rankings include Oregon at No. 4, Stanford at No. 12 and Washington at No. 21.
Of all the conferences, the Southeastern Conference has the most teams in the rankings with six, including four in the top 10.
The first AP Top-25 poll will be released shortly before the beginning of the season, while the first BCS Standings will be released after Week 8 of the season.
USC will kick off the 2012-13 season with a home matchup against Hawai’i on Sept. 1.
Yeah…what SBTrojan said…must proofread, Jeremy lol…
I’m pretty sure that the ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE crushed the LSU Tigers in this years championship game….not the other way around as stated in the article.

After defeating Pac-12 rival Stanford in the round of 16, the USC women’s tennis team could not keep its NCAA tournament run alive, falling to UCLA 4-3 in the semifinals.
Playing against the Bruins for the fourth time this season, the Women of Troy had their work cut out for them trying to defeat UCLA just weeks after beating them for the Pac-12 title.
Making their first appearance in the NCAA semifinals since 2006, USC had to take down Stanford in the round of 16 before they faced the Bruins.
Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Locked in a tight contest against a Cardinal team they had previously defeated this season, the Women of Troy took down Stanford behind the strong play of junior Danielle Lao, who clinched the 4-2 victory with a win over No. 5 Mallory Burdette.
USC’s victory over Stanford marked its first win over the Cardinal in an NCAA tournament game since 1983, a whopping 29 years.
The Women of Troy remained steadfast despite going down a set in all but one singles match and showed true resiliency in coming back.
In the next round, USC could not squeeze out another tight victory against UCLA as the team’s luck seemed to run out. Against the top-seeded Bruins, the Women of Troy lost the doubles’ point to start the match, putting them in a 1-0 hole early on in the match.
The sixth-ranked doubles squad of Anderson and Morton proved to be too much for the tandem of sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria, who lost the match 8-3.
On court 2, the duo of freshman Zoe Scandalis and junior Valeria Pulido tied the match at 4-4 against UCLA’s Dolehide/Montez before losing the next four points, 8-4.
During the singles’ portion, the Women of Troy ran out to a 3-2 lead behind the strong play at the bottom of their lineup. Freshman Gabriella DeSimone continued her strong play in the NCAA tournament, recovering from an 0-6 hole in the first set to win on court 5.
Pulido (7-5, 3-6, 6-1) and Sabrina Santamaria (7-5, 2-6, 6-4) followed with victories at 6 and 3, respectively, to build the USC lead.
USC’s one-set lead would not last long, as No. 4 Robin Anderson rebounded from a one-set deficit to win against Scandalis on court 1.
In the final match, Danielle Lao could not finish off McCall Jones as the Bruins would take the semifinal behind her 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 victory.
Despite the loss, the Women of Troy finished the year at 24-4, which marks their best record since 1985.

The Trojans distanced themselves from the field on the last day, finishing 4-under-par on the final day and finishing with a total score of 11-under-par 841.  Oregon finished in second place at 842 while Kent State, Virginia and TCU rounded out the top-five.
Kang led the Trojans throughout the tournament and earned another top-12 finish, finishing in 10th place with a final score of 4-under-par 209.
Lim (72-70-69) and freshman Anthony Paolucci (67-69-75) tied for 13th at 2-under-par 211. Lim had three birdies in the final round and an eagle at 11th hole. Paolucci’s finished in the top 17, his fifth top finish this season. Smith, meanwhile, had five birdies, including three during a 2-under-par on the back 9. Junior Martin Trainer hit three birdies in the final round and finished in 35th place.
“It feels great to play well in such a critical week,” USC coach Chris Zambri said in a statement. “Everyone contributed and now we need to find ways to improve and be sharp for [the Rivera Country Club].”
In his sixth seasons at USC, Zambri has led the Trojans into the NCAA finals four times.
USC is now eyeing the NCAA final next week. The championship, hosted by the Trojans, starts May 29 and continues until June 3 and will be held at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. The Trojans are looking for their first national title in program history.

After losing two of three games to Arizona last weekend, the USC baseball team has now lost three consecutive series and four of its last five series overall.
But unlike those other series losses, they didn’t get swept thsi time around.
Slump city · Senior catcher Kevin Roundtree hit a homerun against Arizona on Sunday. But it was not enough to help the Trojans win. - Corey Marquetti | Summer Trojan
Having not won a game in the month of May, the Trojans (23-27, 8-19) entered a three-game home stand against No. 14 Arizona on an eight-game losing skid: three against Washington, three against No. 5 Oregon, and singular midweek losses at No. 20 Cal State Fullerton and at Washington State.
That eight-game slide extended to nine with an 11-1 throttling at the hands of the Wildcats Friday night at Dedeaux Field.
But on Saturday the Trojans hit their stride with an 8-4 victory over the Wildcats (36-16, 18-9).
Making his second-to-last start as a Trojan and his last at Dedeaux Field, senior Andrew Triggs made it count. The four-year fixture in the Trojans’ rotation went seven strong innings, allowing just three runs on nine hits.
But down 3-2 in the sixth inning, the Trojans were in danger of squandering yet another quality outing from their pitching ace as they have done numerous times this season.
The Trojans were being no-hit into the sixth, but responded with seven knocks in the sixth, including five in a row at one point to vault to an 8-3 lead.
Arizona did get one back in the ninth, but it was no matter as the Trojans coasted to an 8-4 win.
After regaining some momentum Saturday, the Trojans hoped to steal the series from the Wildcats on Sunday’s senior day.
Eleven seniors were honored in what was the Trojans last conference home game of the season.
USC took an early 1-0 lead on senior catcher Kevin Roundtree’s leadoff homer in the bottom of the first inning.
But Roundtree allowed the Wildcats to tie the game on a passed ball in the top of the second, the first of the Trojan errors on the day.
After giving up back-to-back singles to lead off the second, freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley committed a throwing error — the second Trojan error of the day — on a sacrifice bunt attempt to load the bases with no outs.
Following a  strikeout, Tarpley walked in the go-ahead run and gave up a two-RBI single to give the Wildcats a commanding 4-1 lead.
Freshman second baseman Andres Rodriguez proceeded to boot a grounder to give another score to the Wildcats. He had not committed any errors up to that point this season.
Tarpley rebounded, going six strong innings with just two earned runs (but five in total).
For the first time in nine games, the Trojans outhit their opponent (9-8 on Sunday), but could not parlay those baserunners into runs, with Roundtree’s homer serving as the lone run in a 6-1 defeat at the hands of Arizona.
The Trojans play their final home game of the season tonight at 6 p.m. when they host UC Riverside at Dedeaux Field, and they wrap up their season with three games against crosstown-rival No. 3 UCLA in Westwood over the weekend.
Add another loss for May yesterday vs. UCSB making it 11 out 12 since the team was five games over .500
Sad that it appears they have given up the season lately even with the one win last weekend. Games not
really close from memory writing this comment. Changes need to be made at the top. Way too much coaching
on every batter hitting, and pitch thrown Eleven seniors which is so unusual and this is the result from all that experience.

Though it’s difficult to admit, the topic of race is still as dividing and mystifying as it was 50 years ago.
This idea has never been so clear as in the recent arrests of Bryan Barnes and Javier Bolden, two black males charged with the murders of USC graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu, who were shot in cold blood in the early morning of April 11.
The school and the Los Angeles Police Department have been vigilant in attempting to catch the killers. Finally, some sort of justice might be done.
Yet instead of rejoicing over the fact that two alleged murderers are off our streets, a surprising amount of attention has been pointed toward the two suspects’ race.
Commenters on an online Daily Trojan article posted some troubling thoughts, such as “I already suspected that the villains are African American . . . and I was right.” Other commenters have even referenced George Zimmerman, a suspect in the shooting of a black teenager, and how Zimmerman could have stopped Barnes and Bolden.
It’s terrifying to think that someone would advocate shooting based on racial profiling as a preemptive strike to murder. Even though such comments are naturally hyperbolic, it’s still quite easy to see that the topic of race isn’t going away any time soon. Though the suspects’ race is usually released for the public to help law enforcement catch them, it seems as if it’ll become a focal point in this case.
Race shouldn’t matter. After all, race is purely a social construct, and no biological difference whatsoever exists between races.
Unfortunately, that fact will probably not change the opinion of some people, which begs the question: Why?
Is it because we, as students, live in a predominantly black and Hispanic community? Is it because black men make up 40.2 percent of all incarcerated males, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report? Or is it something else, something more under the radar and troubling?
Some would say that when a Caucasian man is convicted of a murder, he doesn’t represent his race — he’s simply just a murderer who happened to be white.  The same perception should apply to all races.
South Los Angeles is not a dangerous place because of the black and Hispanic population. It’s a dangerous place because it’s filled with gang activity and people who feel as if they have no choice but to steal and kill to survive. An isolated incident has led some students to fear people who had nothing to do with the attack, largely because of assumptions based on skin color.
Were the devastating murders of Qu and Wu in retaliation for something? A gang initiation? A robbery gone wrong? Though the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office says it was a “botched robbery,” we might never know what really happened.
What we do know is that their deaths should not be overshadowed by the race of their suspected killers. Instead of focusing on color, we should be making our school a better and safer place — for all.

The discussion of race, unfortunately, is not out of place when discussing this topic.  To do otherwise would be a cop out. The Black community ( whatever that means) does have to take a long hard look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that the culture they often perpetuate and romanticize, that is hop hop culture and often thug culture, is a cancer on their youth and does nothing to help their own people or the perception of their people by others of other cultures.  If one of another culture is walking down the street and sees a black approaching they will not think, ” there is a black male, he is statistically more proportionally likely to do me harm unfortunately do to a higher likelihood of having grown up impoverished and without strong male parental role model, but of course that is do to ingrained institutionalized racism in our society as well as historical economic bias”, the person will simple cross to the other side of the street out of fear of being harmed, and rightly so.  All any black person can do is better themselves, and thus by extension, better their people one family at a time,  and help the perception and the statistics, one person at a time. Fair or not, the victim mentality does not bring a certain race or culture out of poverty and improve the inflammatory statistics. Over compensating any bias with hard work, extra accountability, and taking extra personal responsibility for ones actions, as well as the actions of ones family members, will do more for the catapulting blacks from their cycle of generational welfare then any march or social program will. Why were the shooters partying with the “No Respect Inc.” crew and shooting other party crew members before this horrible crime against the exchange students? And it is valid to ask where the black community leaders are when these types of criminal acts by one of their own occur. The leaders should be vocal in their condemnation of such acts and vocal in taking responsibility for the good and bad of their race, they chose to be in the spotlight and speak for their race, they need to show visible shame and accountability when crimes like this occur.  The tough questions have to be asked by any group, if a group is to better themselves, and ultimately, excusing away criminal activity with philosophical gymnastics and high minded, navel gazing, concepts of large scale social injustice only makes for more George Zimmermans, and disgraces the whole race.  Maybe if the black communities had more tiger moms, and especially, dads, and a few less Jessie Jacksons and thug icons we wouldn’t they would not have these problems. ( Yes, I am aware the last statement was a bit cheap, but perhaps a there is a little truth there.)
In response to your comments. First of all you fail to recognize the diversity of Blacks in America.
They are not a member of a collective nation of people immigrating over here from a national collective based on culture, religion, language, or any other homogeneous notion that you could attribute to say mainland Chinese, Italians, Spanish, etc. The things that bind Blacks together into a solitary group is primarily not based on ethnicity, but guided by race and socioeconomic status, and is depicted by the same society that fails to recognize their diversity. 
Question- Are Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Indians, etc. a.k.a. Asians, all bound by the same cultural mores, standards, and behaviors because they resemble each other by the color of their skin? Are they the YELLOW PEOPLE, that should all come together and speak out with leadership as a whole, even if they’ve have had their cultures, language, and origins stripped from them, and herded together like cattle? Do you even think that is reasonable or possible to delineate? 
When you discuss “Black people” in your mind, you must think that you see a group of people that have all originated from the same place, socially, culturally, historically, economically, morally, and ethnically. Your eyes deceive youk if that is the case
Is this an excuse? No of course not. As Americans, it is shameful that one segment of the society, among many others has not yet reached the heights of prospering in the same way as other citizens have. But this problem is not unique. These problems exist in poor communities regardless of skin color. Are these problems unique to Blacks alone? No, but these problems have become exacerbated by gangs and drugs, which were introduced to desperate people by those seeking to exploit a market (people) that they have no ties with. 
This problem becomes a “racial issue” when the color of skin does not match up with the victim.
If this had been a white shooting a white, an yellow shooting a yellow, or a black shooting a black. The idea of race become irrelevant and this discussion about “Black history” and poorly sourced statistics, and racist statements would matter not.
The issue as the writer has pointed out is that people want to talk about it being racial, because of the simple fact that they were different races involved. 
The money trail, or lack thereof.. is pretty much the path that will lead you either into or out of the ghettos of your mind.
People that throw around statistics to skew in argument around their bias should first get there numbers correct.
First, violent crime has been dropping everywhere since 2006 each and every year.  Second, there are more than twice as many White’s that have committed crimes than Blacks, its the majority so that should be obvious.
There have been more murders overall committed by Whites than Blacks (FBI Uniformed Crime Report-Table 43- Crime by Race 2010 latest totals). These statistics are put out by the FBI.
Blacks are more than twice as likely to be arrested for murder than Whites, while more Whites “overall” have committed more murders. The only major category of crime that Blacks lead overall is in Robbery.
Murder, Rape, Aggravated Assault, Burglary, Car Theft, Arson, Fraud, Embezzlement, Stolen Property Receiving, Prostitution, Sex Offenses, are all led by Whites.
total arrests: 7,066,154 – Whites
total arrests: 2,846,862 – Blacks
Or the total distribution of crime by proportion: Whites 69.4 	Blacks 28.0
Now, lets look at those numbers.. Since Blacks make up 13% of the population and produce 28% of the crime, you could extrapolate that ‘Blacks are more apt to commit crime than Whites, until you consider the economic data (and gang statistics) surrounding those numbers. When you consider the economic disparity between the groups, a picture starts to emerge.
A majority of the crime anywhere is related to economic circumstances and dysfunction associated with gang violence, drugs, and lack of educational and employment opportunity.
I would just like to say thank you to this author for writing this piece. I think that you bring up a valid point. I am truly shocked and disheartened by the ignorance and blatant racism in the comment section. Some of it is truly disgusting, and it is sad that these people represent our university.
It’s good to know that the school is teaching us how to think for ourselves, question convention, & not simply accept common generalizations. This issue truly does go beyond simply race. Having done research on Chinese news sources, I was disheartened to see that some Chinese citizens actually praised these murders simply because they were believed to be of a higher class or had family ties to the government. I completely agree that the comments posted here do not represent the university we love so much, nor the students, faculty, & staff that comprise it. As a school, USC has made leaps and bounds in prestige because the people here haven’t accepted mediocrity & past stigmas. We take it upon ourselves to become better individuals to make not only ourselves better, but also this school, it’s students, & what we stand for. I would urge everyone who reads/posts on this article to look reflectively upon yourselves before passing judgment. There are many ways to cut this cake & race is simply on of them. I’m sure that there are situations where life has cut the cake in a way that disadvantaged you as well. Think about not how many ways we can cut up the issue, but rather how we can put ourselves back together, stronger than before.
“Let he who is without sin cast the first stone”
So all of those sociology professors must have gotten their research from Wikipedia, huh?
Yes this is not about race. 
But can you remind black protestors or your theory on race when they call for Asians and other immigrants to get out of “their” neighborhoods when they open up shops?
It goes both ways. Black people brought up race in Michael Vick’s dogfighting case when IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE.
CLEARLY you are Black because no one else would ever write anything as selfish as this. Two people were murdered by your race, and what do you do? You blame other people for assuming the criminals were Black! Maybe you should look at some statistics and like someone else said, the Black population needs to take responsibility for its actions rather than blaming it on others. Racial profiling might be wrong, but did you ever think that maybe the profile of Blacks being criminal exists in the first place because so many criminals are Black?! Have you not seen a DPS report? Almost every single one lists the perpetrator as being Black or Hispanic… I guessed that the murderers were of those two races because those two races commit the most crimes around here! The probability of the murderers being White or Asian was much, much, lower. Furthermore, the gangs here ARE composed of Blacks and Hispanics, so, to an extent, they are interchangeable.
You’re a moron. This is a much more complicated issue than you’re making it out to be. Hope you’re not a USC student.
Why is he a moron? How is the issue more complicated than he makes it out to be?
Statistically, he’s completely right. Blacks are statistically more dangerous. There’s something broken with the black race. They need to stop shooting people and start taking some responsibility for their lives.
The article notes that USC’s neighborhood is full of “people who feel as if they have no choice but to steal and kill to survive.”
Well, WHY do they feel they have to do that? Why can’t they get a job and work their way through life and education like everyone else? Is it because they’re genetically stupid and lazy and dangerous? Is it because their parents and black culture values toking up and sagging pants, rather than hard work?
Whatever it is, it’s a problem blacks have to deal with, rather than blaming other races — like this article does.
First of all, race is a terribly complicated issue. 
It seems as though you are insinuating that black people are somehow born with the inherent need to shoot people. Or it’s part of the culture. I mean, I’m pretty sure most people, yes, black people included, don’t wake up in the morning and think “You know what? I’m going to shoot somebody today.” I think even criminals realize this does not lead to good things. 
Then to answer your questions,
Well, sometimes people grow up in a tough life. They grow up in a bad environment with not a lot of people around to support them, and they think that the only way to get by is to steal and kill. Is it right? Of course not, but if the environment around you is not good, then  you generally tend to follow by example. 
I would like to note that when I say “environment” I do not mean “black community.” If you think that growing up in a black community automatically translates to murderer, gang member, or what have you, maybe you should talk to Barack Obama, Oprah, or some of my friends who are smart, well-versed, and successful. 
As far as getting a job and an education, again, it goes back to the environment issue. If you come from an environment where education is not important, then nobody is there to motivate you to get an education. Los Angeles has the highest unemployment rate in the country, and it is that much harder if you don’t have an education. Education also costs money, which comes from employment…so there you go.
I’m not really sure if you’re insinuating if black people are born genetically stupid and lazy and dangerous or not, so I’m just going to skip that. I wouldn’t want make outrageous claims, of course.
I can soundly assure you that if there were a book on the black culture, it would not include: “shooting people,” “stealing,” and “gangs” as required activities. Are there people in the black community who glorify that? Of course. There are also people in the White, Asian, Native American, and Hispanic cultures who glorify that. 
So if these two men are the “black community’s problem” and no one else’s, then is every white murderer only the “white community’s problem”? 
What I guess I’m trying to say is, you missed the whole point of this article. The point of this article is that these men did not shoot these two students because they were black. We don’t know why they did. But to assume they shot somebody because of their race is terribly ignorant. And frankly, ignorance is what breeds racism.
Spin all you want, and blame the “environment” all you’d like, but your environment won’t change until you change your attitude and take your responsiblity.
Prosecutors should demand capital punishment in this case. These vile criminals have no place on this earth. We lost two bright young people who could have created great companies or helped their country. Their lives have been lost and we are left with a couple of low lifes who only want money because they are too lazy to work. I blame them and their parents. I also blame the black community which is failing to provide leadership to the new generation. All they have to look up to are rap singers whose pants are falling down.
This s a deep tragedy for so many good people, the two students, their parents and fellow citizens, their friends and the USC community, los angeles and the United States.  I say it starts with the parenting or lack of.  Fathers need to live in the  house with their children and help raise them on a daily basis.  They need a good male role mode. discipline, the security, and income.  Without that they have a much higher probability to criminalize.  I say if convicted, march their parents before the cameras and make them make a statement of what went so dreadfully wrong and have them accept some responsibility for the pain they brought to the world.  Without society landing heavy coresponsibility on the parents, nothing will change, ever.
College culture is, for the most part, progressive. Academics, especially those in humanities departments, condone egregious actions like this double murder. They rationalize these wanton acts because the perpetrators got the short end of the stick in life; they were neglected by the “European, white dominated” society/system. Then, when the suspects get all this overwhelming evidence against them, you get the hackneyed, “he’s a good boy, he’d never do that, he’s my baby…blah blah blah” with crocodile tears streaming. 
If these two are indeed the perpetrators, I think the one who pulled the trigger should receive capital punishment, and the other, whatever the judge thinks is condign. 
race card = cop out
As a college professor on the east coast I found the article a perfect read. Disturbing are the comments. I didn’t need to look at the race of the writer. It didn’t matter. What he wrote is absolutely true. “South Los Angeles is not a dangerous place because of the black and Hispanic population. It’s a dangerous place because it’s filled with gang activity and people who feel as if they have no choice but to steal and kill to survive”. I live in a mixed race community. On my street of 10 homes are   Caucasian, Asia, African American and Hispanic families. We all get along and skin color or race has no bearing on our friendships. In my city there was a recent murder. An African American male killed by an African American male. The community DID protest. They want it to stop. Mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers do not want to see their child killed, They don’t want to see their child go to jail for life. The screaming from the pulpits should be to stop the cycle of gangs violence and drugs. These young men (mostly) need hope and they don’t have it. This is a complex issue. It should not be about race. And Freddie, having lived in China, the trial for these suspected murderers would be in about a month and they would be put to death a few days after. Again, this is a complex issue and maybe life in prison on death row is more appealing that the support these young men are getting on the street.
Having been alive more than half a century, I’ve witnessed the evolution of our culture from the days of civil rights to the continuing race conflicts of today.  Let’s all be truthful here… the main issue that continues to divide our culture is that of all races, African Americans are often most unwilling to accept responsibility for the behavior of members in their community (shall we all remember the OJ case?).  Let’s look at the Zimmerman/Martin case.  Many black community leaders and politicians are rallying around this incident as if it’s reflective of how all non-blacks behave when it’s simply a tragic example of one vigilante making an awful mistake for which he will pay.   However, when two black men walk up to a car with two Asians and shoot them at point black range, where are the black community leaders then?  Where are the marches protesting this egregious behavior?  Where are the church leaders pounding the pulpit extolling their congregation to stand up against gang violence?  That’s right… there’s just silence.  So, until the black community is willing to step up and represent their community–both when assaulted and when it is committing the assault–non-blacks will continue to dismiss black grievances because they are often so one-sided.  And I have many black friends who agree.
You know, just like these two men don’t represent the thoughts of the entire black community, your black friends don’t either. I’m not saying their opinion is not valid, I’m just saying that a few people’s opinions very rarely reflect the majority opinion of an entire group of people.
And that is exactly what the problem is
The interesting thing is that some black people, like the author of this piece, make everything about themselves. The real racist issue surrounding this case was the way the news media – and not just the few internet commenters you’re complaining about who have a much smaller reach – spun this story to represent the victims as rich spoiled kids driving a fancy car – actually an old used car worth less than the cheapest brand-new sub-compact. I was shocked to click on the link to this story and find nothing about that – only another self-centered, self-absorbed person who cares only about “their side” and “their people” winning. The nonsense suggestion that this could have been a possible gang or revenge killing is complete and utter fabrication and rumor mongering. Think about it Ms. Watson and admit it. You know you’re spinning lies. And you know you’re taking the focus off the real racism surrounding this story. If you’re going to guess at motivation, and if race played a part in this case, it’s most likely the victims were targeted because they were Asian.
There are so many things I could respond to with this, but my first one is — how in the world do you know the author of this piece is black? Do you know the author personally?

Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers student who came to national notoriety for his harassment of gay roommate Tyler Clementi, received Monday a sentence of 30 days in jail, three years’ probation, 300 hours of community service and a $10,000 fine for illegally spying on and filming Clementi having an intimate moment with another man.
Design by Christina Ellis
And though prosecutors never accused Ravi of being responsible, the tragic suicide of the 18-year-old Clementi off the George Washington Bridge in September 2010 left many clamoring for justice: They wanted Ravi, now 20, to pay.
Thirty days in jail doesn’t seem that bad when you compare it to the 10 years in prison that prosecutors wanted, based on Ravi’s conviction last March of invasion of privacy, witness tampering, tampering of evidence and the hate crime of bias intimidation. But looking at what Ravi actually did, and not the aftermath of his offenses, his relatively short sentence appears to be on the mark.  If anything 30 days in jail is too long.
Ravi acted in an irresponsible, mean-spirited manner in using a webcam to spy on his roommate and revealing Clementi’s deeply private actions.  And even now, he acts unrepentant: “I heard this jury say ‘guilty’ 288 times. 24 questions, 12 jurors — that’s the multiplication. And I haven’t heard you apologize once,” Judge Glenn Berman told Ravi on Monday.  Berman went on to say that Ravi acted out of “colossal insensitivity,” which many could agree with.
But that’s exactly the problem: Ravi acted insensitively, but bullying of this kind — observing others with an intent to belittle, setting up heartless pranks and the like — plays a common role in the lives of many American teenagers, whether they’re perpetrators or victims. The kind of intolerance that Ravi showed, be it referring to Clementi as a “f-g” or derisively tweeting about him “kissing a dude,” isn’t new: Anyone who has attended high school knows that this sort of behavior exists in droves.
It’s aggravatingly difficult to draw the line between bullying and genuine, punishable hate crime. What of the countless bullies who do more than just spy, but shove, beat and threaten people in the shadows of the schoolyard, only to get a weak-handed reprimand by the principal? Can we charge them all with the hate crime of “bias intimidation”? Should they all be going to jail?
Clementi’s sexual orientation, along with his suicide, makes it incredibly easy to play connect-the-dots when it comes to the Rutgers case.  It’s simple to say that Clementi would have been fine — and wouldn’t have killed himself — if Ravi hadn’t done anything.  It’s simple to pick and choose Ravi’s insults and say that homophobia clearly played a prevailing role.  It’s simple to make this case out to be a lesson about hatred toward the gay community, and how it needs to be stopped.
But trying to find meaning in Clementi’s death ignores the greater point: Not enough evidence exists to justify this as a hate crime in the traditional vicious sense. The law must punish based on actions alone, not context or the aftermath of a crime.
As far as we can really tell, Ravi didn’t target Clementi because he was gay — Ravi did it because, well, he just didn’t really like Clementi, and made fun of everything from Clementi’s nerdiness to his economic status. One can only wonder what sort of effect the issue of gay discrimination, along with the high-profile suicide, had on the jury in its deliberation.
What’s clear is this: Ravi’s conviction will follow him for the rest of his life. Considering that some readers probably have acted even more maliciously than Ravi ever did and gotten away with it, 30 days in jail seems to be more than enough.

“Great Article” Jack?  It sucks. I think the USC community is going to be watching the DT
The DT is the most LGBT friendly school paper outside of Berkeley.   This article is just some cover for the straights and haters among us.  Lighten up LGBT community.
Great article. It’s a shame the commenters are so ignorant. Ravi was railroaded…he should never have faced criminal charges in the first place. Sure what he did was wrong, but it doesn’t deserve incarceration. Kids bully each other, and in the end it makes them stronger and more prepared to deal with a society where not everyone will treat them like a beautiful snowflake.
I just don’t want my school news paper editor to be so insensitive to gay guys like my self. I think it was a hate crime, and  the many gay friends and faculty here at USC feel terrible that no justice was done.
For all of you who disagree with the ruling and this article: What charges would you have sentenced against Ravi that he wasn’t already sentenced with?
90 days in prison with the regular population; order him to engage in “community outreach” programs to gay people; face Clementi’s family members in person, and apologize eye to eye; and anything to forge a sense of contrition in him. The guy is defiant, arrogant, stubborn and will not concede to the egregiousness of his actions.
I was not happy with the ruling. My brother is in the closet to my parents who are Mormon. Four of brothers and sisters support my gay brother 100 percent. The other ones are too young. But it was hell for him to tell me, he had no idea how I was going to react. He thought about many things including ending his life. I disagree with this ruling and this article.
He did not know that the guy was going to kill him self, one could argue. When people in South Central shoot guns into the air and  accidentally shoot someone, should they get 4 weeks for firing a gun in celebration? They did not meant to harm anyone, one could argue. If someone has an abortion, tells someone in the privacy of her home is spied and videotaped and gets put on a video to be made public in the world wide web by an other to cause harm, and kills her self, should  that person get 4 weeks. I know that we all come from a different spectrum of society.We all know that many young gay men often kill them selves because society and their families think of them as an abomination. I know this was NYC where gay life is normal to many, but is not the norm in the 50 states, or the bible belt or the place from where Rabi and Clementi were from. If Ravi would have been gay and this scenario would have happened to him, he would likely have killed him self. He is guilty of the murder of Clementi.  If Eddie Kim would have been in Clementi scenario, there is a good chance he would have brought shame to his family. Eddie Kim does not have the leadership and character to be editor.
“When people in South Central shoot guns into the air and accidentally shoot someone, should they get 4 weeks for firing a gun in celebration?” -This is a separate issue, as shooter is directly responsible for the injuries of the person. Ravi was not directly responsible for Clementi’s suicide. He did not force the consequence. Clementi, though I’m sure in extreme pain, did not need to commit suicide.
Don’t get me wrong, I despise Ravi I’m sure as much as you do, and I am all for gay rights and ensuring equal treatment and protection for everyone. But I don’t think that Ravi should be punished any more than the sentence he was given.
You use a “false analogy” yourself. When CARELESS people shoot guns in the air, they don’t intend for the stray bullet to hurt anyone, but sometimes do. 
Ravi didn’t intend for his actions to set in motion Clementi’s suicide, but they did. 
Typically, when people use the hackeneyed, “I am all for gay rights; I’m not racist, I got 3 black friends, 4 Hispanic ones…” they’re usually the opposite of that. And ironically, people who don’t say those kinds of things, are branded as bigots. It means: Don’t wear your heart on your sleeve; talk is cheap.
According to the article Kim or the court does not see that because of the actions taken by Ravi a young man is dead. He put this video on the internet, knowing that at the very least, it would hurt and embarrass the guys involved. If I had been a juror I would have given him the maximum sentence under law. As far as Kim I think he is insensitive to gays. He caresless for the rights of many students on this campus and he does not for me. I would want Kim removed from his possition as summer editor, please resign.
That’s because Ravi wasn’t directly responsible for the death of Tyler Clementi. Sure, his actions may have contributed to a lifelong string of harassment that culminated in Clementi’s suicide, but it isn’t like Ravi dragged Clementi to the bridge and pushed him off. What Ravi did was terrible. That’s undeniable. But we can’t look beyond Ravi’s actions and claim that Clementi’s death was directly caused by the actions of his roommate. Kim isn’t insensitive to homosexuals, he’s looking at the law with reason removed from emotion just as the jurors did. What Ravi did wasn’t murder, and some may argue, as Kim stated, that his actions were minor compared to some of the physical types of bullying that go unpunished. In this case the eventual consequences were far worse, but this wasn’t a direct result of Ravi’s actions.
All of you are criticizing the article and Eddie based on emotion and not reason. Perhaps the article wasn’t as sensitive to the tragic event as you would’ve liked it to be, but that doesn’t make what Eddie was saying any less true. Ravi was punished for actions he committed in violation of the law. The consequences, I’m sure, were far beyond what Ravi expected. However, these consequences were caused indirectly by Ravi’s insensitive actions. If you look at what he did you’ll see that he did not violate laws to justify a harsher sentence. The kid’s a bully, not a killer. And Eddie wasn’t saying that Ravi’s or similar actions are justified because the perpetrators are young or do not cause damage, but rather that bullying worse than Ravi’s that happen to have less dire consequences happen everyday and go unpunished. So yes, this was a tragedy that we should do everything we can to avoid. But at the end of the day, Ravi didn’t commit crimes punishable by more than the sentence he was given, no matter how bad the consequences his actions caused.
Everyone needs to back the hell off here. Eddie is simply approaching this from a different perspective, one that stands farther away from emotion and sits on the seat of logic. Ravi should go to jail for the things he was convicted of and by no means is his behavior excusable not should it be tolerated. But the reality here is that Ravi did not kill anyone nor should he be considered a killer. Ravi was prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Based on the evidence he’s a complete shthead but guess what, he wasn’t a killer. Plenty of a-holes like Ravi insult, bully, and intimidate others but we don’t prosecute them only because nobody got physically hurt? Ravi deserves to go to jail but Ravi didn’t make anyone jump off a bridge. I do think that this issue is one that the law should take a firmer stance on though. Go Eddie. Fight on bro.
Perhaps we need to forgive  Eddie Kim for his writings.  When republican politicians go out of their way to deny rights to homosexuals, they end up on the news soliciting sex from other men in bathroom at airports. Sometimes we need to read between the lines, and be forgiving. The best to you Eddie Kim, be strong.

Eddie Kim is a disgrace to this new paper and should not be in the Daily Trojan. This is probably something that is common place in Eddie Kim’s world but it does not make it right. Same on you. Leave USC
Please read the New Yorker profile of Ravi and rewrite your article. 
So your argument is that actions which harm other people are fine when you are young/if you stop before real damage is done.
Let’s stop for a moment and remember that Clementi KILLED himself. I’m sure there were other factors involved, but Ravi’s repeated actions obviously had an impact as Clementi went to Ravi’s Twitter right before going to the bridge.
Clementi’s mother, father, siblings will never see him again, partly because Ravi is a bad person/very insecure, and yes probably fairly homophobic. You see to agree that actions have consequences, but to me, a gay man who faced a lot of abuse growing up for my sexuality, 30 days in jail is basically nothing. It is galling that you would suggest it is not enough.
I am going to postulate that you would be singing a very different tune if you were harassed based on someone’s perception of your race. Think about that for awhile and try to write sensitive, reason opinion pieces in the future.
If you’re the editorial director for the summer, I sudder to think what the rest of the summer’s opinion piece will look like.
totally agree with “nope”
+1. Ravi is defiant and not contrite. It doesn’t matter that his actions were indirect; they were still egregious in that they lead Clementi to commit suicide. 
My stance is more conservative than liberal, but believe that one’s sexuality is innate.
