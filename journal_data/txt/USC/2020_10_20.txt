Bold, vivacious and ambitious — singer-songwriter Ella Collier, who hails from Atlanta, started out as “just a girl with an acoustic guitar and an open mic.” 
Now, with 148 Spotify playlists — each carefully curated and prescribed to the production and mood she aspires to achieve in her own music — the singer owns her unique style and bold voice. Take one look at the diverse array of genres and artists in these playlists and Collier’s dedication to genre-blending becomes immediately apparent.
“I’m very big on genre blending. I don’t like to just be this one sound,” Collier said. 
Collier started singing when she was just 7 years old. After witnessing her seemingly endless capacity to sing and dance at every moment, her mother encouraged musical theatre as a creative outlet. Musical theatre then sparked a passion for songwriting, and Collier soon had dreams of being the next Taylor Swift. 
“I saw her on the ‘Ellen’ show when I was 11 years old and she made a song up on the fly,” Collier said. “I decided to write a song right after that.”  
The song she wrote that day was called “For You” and marked the start of Collier’s songwriting career. 
From performing in her basement, pretending that she was at Madison Square Garden, Collier began performing at different venues ranging from the Clive Davis Institute in New York and Bluebird Cafe to the Listening Room in Nashville and Converse’s Rubber Track Studios. By 13, she was working with Jan Smith — the vocal coach behind Drake, Justin Bieber and the Band Perry. 
But it wasn’t until she arrived at the USC Thornton School of Music, as a popular music performance major and music industry minor, that she became interested in diversifying her music output.  
Popular music performance students are expected to learn and perform songs from various genres and eras, from rock and pop to Latin and country music. 
“There’s just a sound that I’ve been wanting to do forever and I feel that when I was younger I didn’t really know [it],” Collier said. “And when I got [to USC] I realized that there was a whole other world and there’s just this person that I always was.” 
Students in the popular music program are also actively encouraged to collaborate with music production students, which is how Collier met John May Clark, her main producer. 
Clark, who is majoring in music production and classical piano, pointed to his close relationship with Collier as one of the major reasons behind their rapport throughout the production process. 
“As a producer, I consider my job to find the best possible way to tell the artist’s truth,” Clark said. “It helps that I’m really close friends with Ella because I also know her life.” 
Their creative process oscillates between spontaneity and routine; Collier will sometimes call Clark in the middle of the night and ask him to produce a beat after she starts the lyrics for a new song, but the pair also have a set routine of two to three studio sessions every week. 
“I’ll just bombard him with music and then we’ll have a session,” Collier said. “We already know the vibes we’re going for.” 
Collier often provides Clark with a few reference tracks — which is where her 148 Spotify playlists come in handy — and from there, they begin to craft the track. 
“We’ll just create a sound together and you just know that it’s our song,” Collier said. “He just knows what I want. Sometimes when we’re doing sessions I’m literally like, ‘How did you just know that this song was going to go in this direction?’” 
Collier performs with a band of fellow junior Thornton students, all popular music performance majors besides Clark. Jack Severino plays bass, Jack Maitra drums, Liza Kaye and Clark play keys and Eli Bramnick plays the guitar. 
Severino, who also assists Collier with instrumentation and writing lyrics, was in Collier’s first pop band. 
“We had a really good working relationship in that band. It was just super cohesive and everything came together easily,” Severino said. “We’re also really good friends, so I feel like that helped a lot.” 
Severino also helps Collier with instrumentation, writing the lyrics and song arrangement. 
“I’ve been writing songs since I was a little kid. I think I wrote my first song when I was probably 5 years old,” Severino said. “But I love doing it with other people too because it’s almost like you’re spending one-on-one time with someone, you’re really getting to know them through the song. Their lyrics … speak for their soul.” 
Produced by Clark and written with Severino, Collier’s most recent single “Talk” was released last November and revolves around her experiences in Atlanta. 
“‘Talk’ is about my hometown,” Collier said. “I love Atlanta and I loved my high school but I had a really hard time. Girls would call me and say, ‘This is an intervention, you need to stop posting about your music’ or ‘You need to stop wearing this.’” 
The pop single thus functions as both a diss and self affirmation track; Collier sings lines like, “No I’m on display while every girl with Gucci belt is / deciding that they hate me,” and “I wanna wear, I wanna do my makeup / And I wanna curl my hair / No it’s not for you or him.“
“Talk,” Collier explained, signifies a bridge between the music she created before Thornton — exclusively pop, Taylor Swift-inspired tracks — and the genre bending she’s incorporating into her singles for her upcoming EP. 
“We basically have the idea of my singles [representing] the different moods I have,” Collier said. “Every song is a way that I act in a certain light.” 
Collier’s upcoming single for the EP is titled “cinderella” and set to be released Oct. 30. 
“‘Cinderella’ is about my persona,” Collier said. “‘Cinderella’ is the first perception of me when you see me out at a club or you see me walk into a room.” 
The track’s production and instrumentation aims to capture the peak energy of a nightclub, with Collier twisting the fairy-tale narrative of Cinderella to end in a less-than-likely love story. While the person she’s dancing with might be drawn to her confidence, Collier explained, “He doesn’t really know who I am, he’s only met the outside.” 
Collier’s “cinderella” features pop melodies over a Latin-inspired trap beat and was mainly inspired by artists like UPSAHL, Azealia Banks, Ashnikko and Gwen Stefani. 
“I want the song to be something you can dance to in the mirror in sweats at night by yourself,” Collier said. “But I definitely feel like it’s one of those songs that you can [also] play at a party.” 
While Collier infuses her pop melodies with a variety of genres, pop is the genre that her music is rooted in. 
“I love pop music,” Collier said. “There’s a lot of intricacies that go into it …. Yes, there’s the oversaturation in pop music, and that’s a market, but I don’t think all pop music is that way.” 
Clark noted that he also used to believe that pop music was shallow and vapid before he started to produce music. 
“I would say that one of the greatest strengths of pop music that people misrepresent as shallowness is the fact that it’s concise,” Clark said. “It’s hard to take a lot of thoughts or take an atmosphere, environment and sound world into a tiny package.” 
In light of developing an EP that revolves around the various perceptions of herself, Collier pointed to how cathartic crafting such personal songs can be. 
“Sometimes when I’m so pissed and I can’t even think, or I’m so sad, I’ll literally click record on my voice memo and I’ll just go,” Collier said. “Even if it doesn’t become something, at least I got it out there … When you make something beautiful out of something that hurts, even good things, it’s like a little disposable camera. You get a little snapshot of the memory, of the emotions.” 
She also stressed the importance of incorporating personal experiences into her music. 
“One thing that I always stand by is that every song is about me,” Collier said. “I want everyone to feel like they’re in my living room.” 
Collier hopes to impart that same feeling of belonging in her performances as well; while the pandemic has prevented her from performing at any venues — The Study or El Cid, for example — she uploads live music sessions on her YouTube and Instagram to stay connected with her followers.  
“Performing is where I am myself. I see the crowd, but it’s my world, and I leave it all out there on the floor,” Collier said. “Like [they] didn’t have to come out here, I’m not shit yet. So the fact that [they’re] here, I want to make the show worth it for them.” 
Despite Collier’s modest assessment of her fame at the moment, she fully intends on making it big after college. 
“Talk” was recently used in an NBA commercial and Collier is developing a catalogue of songs to open up opportunities to write songs for other artists. 
“We’re going for the … gold,” Collier said. “Five years from now, [Clark and I] will be on tour.”

The Armenian American population is a beating heart of Los Angeles, tucked away into the vibrant and comforting charm of Glendale. However, the community is hurting as Turkey’s invasion of Armenia feels all too familiar to the attempt at the eradication of the Armenian people more than 100 years ago.
Eliza Petrosyan, an Armenian-born, Glendale-raised junior majoring in popular music, put together a musical fundraiser this past Friday featuring 10 Armenian musicians to raise money for the Armenia Fund.
The Armenia Fund is an organization facilitating “humanitarian and infrastructure development” t in Armenia in hopes of rebuilding the schools, hospitals and homes that were bombed and destroyed recently.
“I came [to L.A.] when I was about three with my family, and I’ve lived in Glendale most of my life, which has a huge Armenian population,” Petrosyan said. “I grew up around a lot of Armenians and the culture is very close to me.”
In 1915, the Ottoman government of present-day Turkey executed several hundred Armenian intellectuals. Civilians were displaced from their homes and sent on death marches in the Mesopotamian desert without food or water. This marked the start of the planned, systematic genocide of 1.5 million ethnic Armenians. Turkey has yet to officially recognize what happened as a genocide and has rejected any and all claims that the killings were an attempt to destroy the Armenian people.
Now, more than a century later, similar aggression is taking place against Armenia and the area of Artsakh (internationally known as Nagorno Karabakh) — a small piece of land sitting between Armenia and Azerbaijan whose ownership has been long disputed over. 
At the start of the conflict and fighting, Petrosyan said she felt hopeless but eventually got the idea to do a virtual concert fundraiser to aid those being displaced and wounded in Armenia. 
In eight or nine days, Petrosyan was able to connect with the Armenia Fund to streamline donations. She made a list of more than 30 Armenian musicians to reach out to via email and Instagram for performances,  wrote a program and got all the Zoom information set up.
There haven’t been many concerts amid the coronavirus pandemic and through music’s ability to allow emotions to surface and bring people together, Petrosyan hoped that she’d be able to raise “maybe $1,000.”
They raised almost $10,000 from nearly 200 donors.
Silva Sevlian, the associate director at USC’s Institute of Armenian Studies, hosted the event.
“I was very honored to be asked to emcee this event,” Sevlian said. “I was so inspired that [the concert] was student-led, that it included so many voices from the diaspora, so many different songs and that the artists were able to share their music from Germany to New York.”
The fundraiser was a collage of Armenian artists coming together and sharing their art to advocate and help protect their people. 
Sitting in front of a traditional knotted Armenian rug hung on her back wall, musician Krista Marina started off the intimate concert with just her acoustic guitar and mic in hand, singing the melodic trills of the hauntingly beautiful “Sareri Hovin Mernem” by Lena Chamamyan. 
Next came Miqayel Voskanyan, an Armenian musician, composer, songwriter and producer who played his tar — an Armenian instrument — paired with effects from his pedalboard, pushing the boundaries of traditional Armenian music. 
Osheen Manukyan, a third-year cello performance major at The Juilliard School, also performed at the fundraiser with two movements he had prepared from Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Cello Suite No. 2.”
“[The piece] is some of Bach’s most personal and inward-looking music, especially the sarabande of the suite,” Manukyan said. “It’s really one of the darkest moments in all of the cello suites and honestly, it reflects how I feel right now about the awful conflict.”
The fundraiser also featured performances by musicians Gregory Hosharian, Sirapi and Anahit Muradian, Vahagni, Arsen Jamkotchian, the Element Band and Narek Gharakhanian. 
Petrosyan and a band of fellow music students played two traditional folk songs, the second being about missing one’s homeland and wishing to return soon. 
“With everything that’s happening in Armenia, I was feeling pretty alone,” Petrosyan said. “Having that one day where [all the performers] were on a call together listening to music, and everyone was so willing to help, and there were so many people that showed up — it meant a lot.”
It seems like Armenian American author William Saroyan put it best: “Go ahead, destroy Armenia. See if you can do it. Send them into the desert without bread or water. Burn their homes and churches. Then see if they will not laugh, sing and pray again. For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a New Armenia.” 
Petrosyan, among countless other Armenian American activists and organizations, are doing just that.

Instead of lining up at a recruiter booth in his slacks and button-up shirt, surrounded by various other tables and white tents set up on Trousdale Parkway in the early morning, Shreyansh Jhalani logged on to Brazen, an online virtual hiring platform, to attend the Career Center’s virtual career fair from the comfort of his home. With the coronavirus pandemic halting in-person activities last spring, the center transitioned its events to a remote format, holding their first audio- and video-accessible career fair through an online setting this fall that they look to continue in Thursday’s upcoming fair. 
Taking place Sept. 16 and 17, students met with employers and representatives from various industries such as Johnson & Johnson, Southern California Edison and Defense Intelligence Agency, during the virtual fair’s allotted five-hour window. The online platform allowed the Career Center to create virtual employer booths, where company representatives were able to customize their booth with videos, job descriptions and links to apply for open positions. The employer booths were also tagged with information such as their industry and employment type and the experience level they were looking to hire, making their booths easily searchable for students.
The Career Center has hosted six virtual career fairs along with their in-person fairs since 2016, to serve global employers, students and alumni. However, past virtual fairs had only allowed for text-based chats, said Erin Jebavy, marketing and events coordinator at the center. A few months after the transition to remote learning, the Career Center began planning for this fall’s virtual career fair to ensure the best experience for students by hosting the event through Brazen. 
“This was a huge step forward,” Jebavy said. “It allowed students to make a stronger impression on employers while also making more efficient use of both the students’ and employers’ time.”
In addition to the video and audio elements of this career fair, the quality and quantity of employers were also main drivers for students’ attraction to attend, according to Jebavy. Due to the fair’s online formatting, the event was more affordable and manageable for employers to attend and allowed them to bring along numerous recruiters, which allowed for shorter wait times and a more personal experience for students. 
Another factor that Jebavy said contributed to the virtual fair’s efficiency was the ability to wait in up to three lines simultaneously, unlike in-person events. 
“I think it’s efficient as a student, because a lot of these times, you have to wait for at least 15-20 minutes before you can actually speak to a recruiter in person and, at the same time, you cannot speak to someone else,” said Jhalani, a senior majoring in business administration and pursuing a progressive degree in finance. “Through the virtual career fair, I believe I’ve got the opportunity to obviously save time and meet more recruiters that were actually coming on campus.”
Having attended past USC and Marshall School of Business-specific career fairs, Jhalani said that there were times he would prioritize networking with multiple recruiters instead of speaking with larger companies he wished to work with because of the long lines. With the virtual career fair, Jhalani said that missing employers was not an issue and he was easily able to navigate through summer internship opportunities and meet many employers, taking advantage of the feature allowing students to wait in multiple at once.
“USC is a target school for a lot of companies, especially in consulting,” Jhalani said. “I wanted to get exposure to different companies that are hiring from USC and the modal world to get the opportunity to network with recruiters, as well as the people who work in these companies to select one company for my summer internship.”
Following the two-day virtual career fair, the Career Center collected feedback via a survey sent to all attendees and to inform them of related upcoming events. Jebavy said they found that many students enjoyed the convenience and ease of the online platform that made it personable to connect with employers. 
“It was just super easy and convenient,” said Alyssa Delarosa, a junior majoring in psychology. “I could just chill and talk to chat with employers. That was really, really nice.”
Delarosa attended the event to casually pursue opportunities within the psychology and child care fields. Her first time attending a career fair, she said the online setting allowed for an easy-going experience.
“It’s really nice because there’s a lot of people that fear public speaking and meeting people face to face, or may get intimidated,” Delarosa said. “[The online setting] made it more available to people who had that fear because they could just use the chat feature.”
According to Delarosa, employers had the option to invite students to a zoom call and turn their cameras on or remain in a chat throughout the conversation.
Although survey feedback was altogether positive, the Career Center also received responses on how to improve future virtual events. Director of Employer Relations and Research at the Career Center Jennifer Kim said that one concern prevalent in the student feedback survey was the inability to see wait times. However, the center is currently working with Brazen to address the issue for virtual college fair this Thursday.
Beyond the career fair, Kim said the Career Center hopes to engage with students on a weekly basis. According to Jebavy, the Career Center will focus on hosting Trojan Talks — virtual information sessions that explore an organization or industry — to engage with campus organizations such as the Latinx Business Association and the Black Business Student Association. The Career Center will also focusing on increasing their social media presence through Instagram Live chats takeovers from various companies to continue supporting the student population. 
Kim also said she understands students can also be overwhelmed with virtual events but hopes that the center can do their best to support and engage USC students wherever they are located. 
“I want to acknowledge and really empathize with our students, I know that it’s tough going to virtual class, and then coming to a virtual fair or a virtual event that the Career Center is hosting,” Kim said. “I recognize that and I wish I could change things. I wish things were different. But in the current circumstances, I just hope that our students know that we’re really doing our best to support them to support their career development.”

As protests against police brutality and racial injustice swept the streets around the world, Edwin Hill, associate professor of both French and Italian and American Studies and Ethnicity, was motivated to redesign his class into a space in which it would spread awareness of racial injustice as a global issue. 
To do so, Hill created the “Black Lives Matter Beyond Borders” lecture series — three webinars focused on discussions of social justice, anti-Black racism, police brutality, mass incarceration, systemic racism, intersectionality and the criminalization of Black people around the world.
Hill, with the support of the department of French and Italian and the department of gender and sexuality studies, invited activists and scholars to speak and spread awareness about systemic racism around the globe in his class “Black Europe.” 
The “Black Lives Matter Beyond Borders” lectures began Monday with Fania Noël, a Haitian-born French Afro-feminist organizer, thinker and writer. Noël began the lecture by sharing life stories from the moment she was born in Haiti to the days she began advocating about Afro-feminist causes. 
The killing of George Floyd in May sparked international protests and brought issues of police brutality and systemic racial injustice to the forefront. Hill said his class and lectures needed to respond directly to these events — and what he considers the “George Floyd effect.”
“I hope that it gets people thinking,” Hill said. “I hope that it gets people sharing ideas. I hope it also gives people, you know, energy and excitement that’s positive – activism isn’t fighting against [a cause], it’s fighting for also.”
Although the lectures are conducted within his course, the webinars are open to everyone to register and attend. The information and discourse is educational and essential for everyone, Hill said, not only for his students.
“First, everyone should attend — everyone,” he said. “Because the question of anti-Black violence isn’t a question just for Black people. The violence that police enact on citizens is something that affects all of us. And until we understand that, we’ll always have a problem.”
Hill selected speakers for the series with diverse backgrounds in scholarly approaches in an effort to provide a wide range of perspectives in the lectures. 
Writer, scholar and activist Asale Angel-Ajani, who works at the intersections of mass incarceration, migration, gender and the African diaspora, will speak on Wednesday, Oct. 28. Heather Merrill, professor of Africana studies at Hamilton College, will speak on Wednesday, Nov. 4.
“They’re women who have strong grassroots movements, who have worked against enormous gender obstacles of all kinds,” chair of the department of French and Italian Margaret Francesca Rosenthal said. “They’re very inspiring people, and so I would hope that women and men who want to look to potential leaders in their worlds can start with looking at some of these women.” 
Rosenthal, who is also a professor of Italian, said she is attending Hill’s classes to expand on her own knowledge. Rosenthal said she registered to attend the webinar to learn more about systemic racism, particularly in France and Italy. 
She described Hill’s class as a place where students learn through creative and unique ways, rather than the traditional lecture-assignment format. Hill often starts the class with French rap, hip-hop music, videography, film or other kinds of educational tools, Rosenthal said.
“I think Professor Hill’s class is innovative,” Rosenthal said. “It’s inspirational, it’s open minded, it is not pushing anyone’s agenda, it is actually just asking students to think critically and deeply about their own time.” 
Hill said his students come from a variety of different backgrounds and they find his class a place they can freely explore and express themselves. He said that these issues are related to many other fields, such as histories of business, commerce, marketing and advertising.
Jerome Gendrot, a doctorate candidate in French and Francophone studies who is a teaching assistant for Hill’s “Black Europe” class, said the interdisciplinary nature of the class allows students to explore current events through a multicultural lens.
“I think that no matter which culture you belong to, no matter which ethnicity you belong to, contextually everybody’s concerned with what happened recently,” Gendrot said. 
Although the “Black Lives Matter Beyond Borders” series is scheduled for the current semester, Hill hopes it will create momentum to continue into spring. Besides sharing information on how injustice has effects beyond the United States, he said these lectures incorporate a message of hope “that’s rooted in knowledge and determination and compassion for the world.”  
“I want [participants] to walk away with an understanding of Blackness that goes beyond the geopolitical borders of the United States,” Hill said. “I want them to leave with a deeper understanding of what’s taking place around the world.”

A petition urging USC to cancel synchronous classes on Election Day has amassed more than 440 signatures since it was launched Friday. 
Arianna Bollens, a freshman majoring in sociology, said she was inspired to start the petition when she heard about a successful petition that led to George Washington University recognizing Election Day as a university holiday. 
“With this election being so consequential and also being so close, I’m just thinking about ways to get involved, doing different volunteer opportunities, things like that,” Bolens said. “On Friday, I decided, ‘Why not start one for USC?’”
According to the Change.org petition, hosting synchronous classes on Nov. 3 impedes the necessary civic participation from all members of the USC community, citing a  report from the U.S. Census Bureau in which eligible voters said that scheduling conflicts were one of the top two reasons they did not vote in 2016. 
Nabiha Najjar, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she saw the petition on the USC 2024 Facebook group and signed it out of concerns about balancing waiting in line at the polls with attending class.
“Nov. 3 should be a day where we just focus on voting and making sure our voices are heard,” Najjar said. “This election is super important and it’s the first election that a lot of us have any say in whatsoever.” 
The petition said that the upcoming election is “critically important” and that everyone has the right to fully participate in the political process. Bollens said that the stakes of the election are part of what motivated her to start the petition.
“A lot of people have been let down by the current administration and left behind by a lot of the policies that have been proposed and have been passed, and I think another four years of that administration is quite scary to a lot of people,” Bollens said. “Being faced with that possibility is driving a lot of people to act and to get involved in ways that they wouldn’t have thought to get involved before. That’s certainly true with me.”
Bollens said that she and her roommate sent about 300 letters to unlikely voters in swing states as part of the Vote Forward initiative. She has also been phone banking for the Biden campaign. While Bollens describes herself as “full force” behind Biden’s campaign, students from all sides of the political spectrum have stood behind the petition as well. 
Molly Davis, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said that she found out about the petition in a Republican group chat and signed it immediately. 
“I have two-, three-hour classes that go through the day, so if we have synchronous classes a lot of people are going to be at a [disadvantage] trying to go to the polls since lines are often longer on Election Day,” Davis said. “Both of my classes for Wednesday, the day after Election Day, have been pre-canceled. The professors had it in the syllabus from day one … I feel like if you’re gonna do that, why not cancel it on Election Day as well?”
Carl Kohnke, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, said that he identifies as moderate but feels more strongly than most years about who he wants in office, which is part of why he signed the petition.
“It’s pretty clear that there’s, you know, millions of people in America who consider this election to possibly be the most important election in history,” Kohnke said. “It’s definitely going to affect the personal lives of a lot of people. So I feel like this piece of history is gonna affect so many people to the point where I feel like we should have the day just to watch and see how it plays out.”

Representatives from the Los Angeles Times and USC gathered virtually Sunday to kick off the L.A. Times Festival of Books. This Festival of Books event was the first of a four-week-long line-up which included author panels, readings and other events in celebration of books.
The Festival of Books Kickoff was moderated by Patt Morrison, a Pulitzer-sharing L.A. Times columnist and author, who led the audience to reminiscence on previous events and explore the legacy the festival has created in its 25 years. The event also included exuberant testimonies from past attendees and a panel with Chris Argentieri, the president and COO of the Times, and USC President Carol Folt on civic engagement, collaboration and literacy.
The festival kickoff began with video clips from past events on the USC campus, showing families and friends reading books and enjoying festivities. The video clips also included highlights of past author visits including Gabrielle Union, Leslie Odom Jr., Jenna Fischer, Moby, Patton Oswalt and Glory Edim. 
“Each year, 150,000 Angelenos from grandkids to grandparents and the grandest names in literature gather,” Morrison said. “They come here for vital, meaningful conversations, discussions, for a big swapmeet of ideas and debate drawn from the books that inspired them.” 
The kickoff also took a moment to reminiscence on some of the most memorable author-participant interactions over the years: Ray Bradbury’s appearance in 1997, where he stayed to sign every single book of those eagerly waiting in line to meet him; Levar Burton’s visit to the festival in 2015, where he received a standing ovation from the audience before he even spoke a word; Rodney King’s appearance in 2012, where 400 people waited in anticipation to hear from him. 
“This event has been and always will be about giving readers the chance to know the world in great and even startling detail through the eyes and the words of the frontline experts, the storytellers and the poets,” Morrision said. 
Following the reminiscent conversations of the past, Morrison gathered with Folt and Argentieri to discuss the current relationship that the Times and USC have with each other and their respective communities and how it benefits the Festival of Books.
“In terms of the festival and the partnership with USC, it’s really a critical part of our community engagement, both at the Times and the festival itself,” Argentieri said. “The partnership with USC has done a number of things for the festival, no question that it’s helped in terms of the programming. We’ve been able to expand the types of authors and the diversity of those, so that’s been great in enhancing the programming.”
Morrison said that both USC and the Times are vital intellectual and cultural fixtures, and the Festival of Books is about combining these two institutions to bring the community together. 
“The Festival plays a big role because it brings on the big stage wonderful people who are writers,” Folt said. “It can get young readers and older readers excited. It also allows us to help with some of our other neighborhood initiatives, like our neighborhood academic initiative, where we are working very hard to get kids from local schools to get training, learning, reading and literacy throughout high school and then go on to university.”
Folt also said various studies have shown the relationship between literacy and success for students, and she wants USC to support students’ education and encourage parents to read to their children. She said that since the Festival of Books encourages group and parent readings, it is a practice of togetherness.
“We are living in a city that has a school district, and while things are improving and graduation rates improve, we’re still graduating students here in L.A. with less than half of those students meeting state standards in the language arts,” Agentieri said. “To improve on literacy takes institutions, both private and public.”
The event proceeded with testimonials from children ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, all inspired by initiatives USC placed within their schools. Although they were no longer in class, the school-aged children were able to complete multiple stories, as USC delivered more than 4,000 books to their family of 15 schools located near the university.
Not straying from the traditional closing of the kickoff, the Festival of Books concluded with USC’s marching band’s uplifting rendition of “Fight On.”
Morrison said that over the next four weeks in four different events, attendees will have a chance to virtually meet former Gov. Jerry Brown, “Crazy Rich Asians” author Kevin Kwan, Ray Bradbury Prize winner Marlon James, Pulitzer Prize winner Marilyn Robinson and many more guests.

Many glorify the idea of ‘the tortured artist,’ much like Vincent van Gogh cutting off his ear and the world making the story infamous. While many are under the impression that artists are some of the happiest people with beautiful imaginations and immense creativity, some struggle with mental health. Creatives often deal with the double-edged sword of using art as a vice and coping mechanism, but in some cases, art can be the cause of stress. 
In a space where artists in major museums in the United States are 85% white and 87% male and mental health problems are extremely stigmatized in minority communities, these spaces can be hard to navigate. While art can serve as a way for Black and Indigenous people and creatives of color to express their identity on canvas, mental health issues shine through for many.
While some aren’t aware of the intersections of identity, creativity and mental health, I think it’s time to talk about it, so who better to speak on the issues than Black and Indigenous people and people of color creatives at USC!
Before we dive into how art and mental health intersect, we must first look at how mental health affects underrepresented communities. In many minority communities, mental health issues are seen as taboo because they are equated to weakness. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, in the Black community, 63% believe depression to be a sign of weakness, and amongst other marginalized communities, the same sentiment rings true. 
For Mary Odusami, a sophomore majoring in biology, growing up in Black communities in Nigeria and the United States also meant idolizing perceived strength and casting away potential mental health issues.
“I think that Blackness has become very much acquainted with a kind of strength,” Odusami said. “It’s not really a positive strength, but it’s more so … ‘how much can you tolerate?’. … When we do see strength, we glamorize and romanticize that while also breaking down the person.”
At other times, members of the Black community feel that mental health problems can be cured through prayer. During slavery, when religion was a foundation to survival for many, they looked to prayer, and that ideology has remained. For Daric Cottingham, a second-year master’s student in the specialized journalism program for entertainment and sports, this helped him deal with anxiety and figure out his identity.
“I’m from the South, for one,” Cottingham said. “A raised Baptist. So I come from a very much so poor part of the Black community where it’s pray away depression, pray away anxiety, pray away the thoughts.”
In many cases, minorities lack accessible mental health services and awareness; these two things are often out of reach and associated with something only white people could have.
“Pray away the thoughts is the notion when it comes to mental health, or [that] those are not Black people problems,” Cottingham said. “The versions of it are like generational curses instead of calling it trauma, or calling it, ‘Oh, I may have anxiety’ or ‘I may have depression.’”
In some cases, mental health isn’t even taught, and with a lack of formal teaching, people go to other forms of education like television. Even then, TV shows with underrepresented people as protagonists use the “Flawless Token” trope and don’t display mental health issues because they are viewed as a negative representation of the community. In actuality, though, the Flawless Token trope can hinder our perception of mental health issues in non-white characters.
“When you look at a children’s TV show, for example, the few times you see a Black heroine depicted, she’s usually perfect,” Odusami said. 
This is the case for many movies because, as Odusami explains, white characters have the ability to go through a tough time mentally without eroding their worth, much like in the film “Eat, Pray, Love,” where protagonist Liz Gilbert goes through a journey of self-discovery and comes out on top. Sadly, minorities don’t have these films. 
From the perspective of many in various minority communities, mental health was never seen as a necessary topic to cover because external factors like racism or poverty were of seemingly greater importance. For Yong Loh, a Cantonese-Malaysian senior majoring in film and TV production, mental health was her parents’ last worry while growing up.
“I know that there’s kind of different struggles within each generation,” Loh said. “Like both my parents grew up in poverty, and they always would say things to me like ‘We’re more focused on that than our mental health’ and ‘we were too busy looking for food to eat’ and that kind of thing.”
Because of this lack of dialogue, people aren’t often given the opportunity to talk to someone when it’s needed most, leaving them feeling as though their emotions aren’t valid. Many, like Alexia Sambrano, a junior majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science, felt their concerns would be overlooked when expressing them to their Latinx family. 
“I felt like if I did talk about these issues that I would just be dismissed or that my concerns wouldn’t be taken seriously,” Sambrano said. “And also that I was bothering someone or annoying them or acting like a burden if I were to speak up about these issues.”
In the creative realm, the influence of mental health is like two sides of a coin. For some, art has presented unnecessary stress for those who feel they need to produce work for people to appreciate constantly. Rather than enjoying the medium, people add unnecessary pressure to themselves, thinking a lack of work means they’ll be forgotten. This can be detrimental to those who post their art to social media, especially in a landscape where unrealistic expectations of a perfect life exist, which, in turn, exacerbate feelings of isolation, loneliness and anxiety. 
“[Instagram has a way] of creating all these deadlines that don’t really exist and all this pressure that shouldn’t really be there,” Loh said. “And [for some] you can see the real kind of benefits of supposedly sticking to a schedule and having you work to churn out every single day, but that’s kind of just a byproduct of being in a capitalist society.” 
In those moments where art begins to feel more like added work and less like a passion, Sambrano recommends taking a step back to reconnect with that medium on the artist’s own terms.
“Just pause what you’re doing and reconnect with that same medium, but in a way that you want to do it, not because a professor or your employer told you to,” Sambrano said. “Disconnecting from your obligations to your passion and connecting again with why you fell in love with the passion has been really a great way for me to remind myself why I’m making art and why it means so much to me.”
For others, like Odusami, mental health issues allow people to create vulnerable works of art that allow them to recognize and work through their emotions. When ideas become too overwhelming, creatives can express and cope through art, much like art therapy. This is especially important when therapy isn’t accessible because of price or stigma.
“I think it has definitely helped me tap into more vulnerable work,” Odusami said. “I think it’s definitely been the moments where I’m grappling with something I might not even notice and I finally can put pen to paper, or realistically, phone to Notes app and something comes out of it. And I’m like, ‘Oh, guess I needed to work through that.’”
In the mental health and creativity realms, what artists really want is more dialogue and transparency to rid the stigma surrounding mental health in minority communities. When more people are open to conversations about their struggles, others will feel more comfortable sharing too. 
“People share the good; they don’t share the bad,” Cottingham said. “And the one thing I try to do all the time is actually just share it all.”  
By sharing with others the hard times that they are dealing with, people normalize the struggles that others also have. This honesty will allow others to open up and hopefully rid of the stigma surrounding mental health.
With dialogue as meaningful as it is, some people need professional help. But in a space where 86% of psychologists are white, it’s hard for people to find someone who can relate to them on an interpersonal and cultural level. Thus meaning, schools, workplaces, etc. need more Black and Indigenous people and people of color therapists. 
“It would be very difficult for me to enter a space from someone who doesn’t have the cultural background of a Latinx person,” Sambrano said. “It would take a lot longer for me to have to explain why I feel certain things or why there are certain social norms or things like that that are within the Latinx community that make my experience navigating certain spaces within the mental health industry a lot harder.” 
For Loh, spaces for Black and Indigenous people and people of color to solely exist are of great importance. Underserved communities as a whole experience a ton of collective trauma and negative external forces such as racism and poverty, andmany find it hard to find safe spaces.
“I think there’s just so much that can be done and I feel like our imagination and the way [we] dream is even such a colonized thing,” Loh said. “You know, unfortunately, we can’t even imagine how things really should be sometimes because we’re so used to how things have been.”
Marginalized communities in the creative space need these outlets for forms of expression but also need the right support to ease off the many added pressures presented. So for what it’s worth, we need to create the art that allows us to sit back and breathe. We can’t always be Superman, but Clark Kent is just as worthy, right?
Marlize Duncan is a sophomore writing about overlooked USC Black and Indigenous creatives and creatives of color tackling the intersection of their work & minority social issues. Her column, “The Minority Support” typically runs every other Tuesday.

In transitioning to online learning over the past seven months, professors across the country and at USC have tried their best to replicate the in-person classroom experience. While this has mostly been done over Zoom and Blackboard discussion boards, many professors across the University have also been trying to maintain rigor by preserving academic integrity in exams and quizzes. 
USC officially supports and licenses extensions such as Proctorio and Respondus LockDown Browser to proctor exams and quizzes in classes. These programs flag suspicious behavior, use machine learning to monitor exams, record test-takers’ cameras and screens and lock down the testing environment to prevent cheating during assessments. However, these programs are merely security theater as their benefits are minimal. Moreover, they come at the cost of accessibility and severe restrictions and invasions of personal liberty and privacy. 
These online proctoring services place particular burdens on marginalized communities and students who may not have testing environments compatible with the program. Respondus Lockdown Browser, for example, requires an environmental check of a room, which involves a 360-degree scan and audiovisual recording. For families that can only afford one computer in a shared space of the house, students would be labeled as in violation of exam procedures. Furthermore, not all computers have webcams and microphones, which both Proctorio and Respondus require for their respective programs. 
This form of live monitoring may also place undue burden, pressure and stress on students who get easily anxious or may not want to show their homes. It’s worrying that it is now exceptionally relevant for a student to compromise their privacy for a quiz or test grade and that not doing so could be viewed unfavorably by professors. Because of these concerns, the University of California, Berkeley banned online exam proctoring outright as the Academic Senate argued that low-income and rural students lacked sufficient access to high-speed connections and compatible laptops.
Attempting to identically replicate in-person teaching online does not work often, especially when considering that if somebody really wants to cheat on a test, then it is likely that they will find a way to do so regardless of context. A host of different platforms and an entirely novel and unprecedented academic environment mean that, going forward, pedagogy and assessments must be different, too. If online learning is our future, then we should take this moment to change how higher education works.
Therefore, faculty must reconsider what it really means to evaluate and test a student’s knowledge. Traditionally, we’ve emphasized short-term retention of material as a reflection of learning and capability, but going forward, assessments should generally be open-note and open-book and encourage more analysis and synthesis of content.  
We are almost always able to consult sources and outside knowledge in our ever-connected world — and it’s difficult to think of a situation (academic or career-related) where an individual would be discouraged from utilizing all available resources to maximize the quality of their work. 
A working group of the UC Berkeley Academic Senate suggested open-book exams as a method of remote examination. Given that, in a remote setting, most students will have access to notes, books and other materials, the working group concluded that it would be best to design exams around this consideration, making them open-book in order to assess mastery of concepts instead of recollection. Faculty must then aim to have students engage and process course material and think critically, analytically and independently in order to apply their skills and knowledge in relevant concepts. In some cases, this might require a reimagining of teaching style or of the course material.
By moving to evaluate a student’s capacity and ability to create, evaluate and analyze course material, professors will better prepare them for the real world. Real life relies on using the most accurate information available to make decisions — and pigeonholing students to memorization will not help in terms of efficiency, understanding and integration of knowledge. USC must not only do away with intrusive online proctoring systems of security theater, but it must also move forward in higher education and promote new methods of thinking, analysis and evaluation.

As college students, many of us don’t necessarily have to think about or plan for retirement right now. Quite frankly, it’s the least of our concerns amid the pandemic and presidential election. However, many emerging or working adults will have to make decisions and step in on behalf of older relatives for a variety of reasons. Whether that means parents or grandparents, aunts or uncles or anyone in between that may need some form of care, it’s handy to know what the lingo and tricks-of-the-trade are when evaluating housing. I’m writing this column to clear the air about the realities of senior living and shed some light on options that individuals of any age can take to prepare for the future.
Often, the term “senior living” brings to mind images of bingo games and the ladies by the pool. For others, this form of assisted living may mean feeling isolated from the world or receiving no privacy due to constant, around-the-clock care. I was practically raised in senior living communities as I would spend time with my parents there, sitting in on bingo games and strolling around the property. Sadly, as I got older, I wasn’t able to spend as much time with the residents and staff and slowly distanced myself altogether. But in the few years I spent there, I gained an understanding of both the positives and negatives of senior living. 
Before we hop into the myths and realities of senior living, it’s important to understand the differences between independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing and memory care. While all of these options provide care and support for older adults, the type of services offered vary from place to place.
As a short disclaimer, I refrain from using the word “facility.” This word degrades the quality of life in these homes that are doing their best to create a space for older adults to socialize and be active. They are not acting as a sort of hospital. 
Independent living communities are, as the name suggests, areas where active older adults can have a place to stay without needing many accommodations from staff. Amenities here may include physical exercise spaces, food preparation and travel opportunities, where available and safe. These communities can be further divided into low-income housing or senior apartments depending on financial accessibility and housing setup. Many of the older adults in independent living communities are partially or fully retired and do not require immediate medical assistance.
Assisted living resembles independent living communities in many ways but with added medical assistance. There are suites and apartments available for older adults interested in different living spaces, as made available under state and county guidelines. However, as I transition over to skilled nursing, it’s important to note that medical assistance in assisted living spaces usually entails medication management and minor assistance with daily tasks. Both assisted and independent living allow for older adults to be in a residential space with the benefits of added personnel and support that is consistent and helpful without being overbearing or restrictive. 
Skilled nursing, also known as convalescent homes, are for older adults who need hourly care and support for medical or physical conditions. Usually under the direction of a physician, these older adults are frequently bedridden or require highly personalized care plans. Additionally, memory care housing primarily supports older adults diagnosed with a form of dementia or Alzheimer’s. Both of these housing arrangements also provide activities for their residents, amenities for easier living and opportunities to socialize where appropriate. 
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader asks, “How do I know when I should help out in the first place? This whole senior living thing is fairly complex, and it’s not something I want to think about right now especially given the pandemic’s effect on nursing homes.”
Honestly, I get that. It’s a stressful and sobering experience to decide whether a loved one is in need of extra care or another place to stay — and hopefully, it is a decision that you don’t have to make anytime soon. The pain and sadness that can come from seeing a loved one struggle with daily activities is one that I hope none of you have to experience; however, it is certainly a reality of aging. 
That being said, consider this a small icebreaker into the world of senior living. As for your question, however, it really does depend on a variety of circumstances: health and well-being, among other obvious factors, as well as financial support and accessibility to a living community. 
The pandemic has also led many families to look for an extra helping hand in taking care of an older relative or adult. Simultaneously, many older adults used to socializing with other residents may have that time taken away by social distancing mandates and changing protocols. 
As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of negative stereotypes that persist when it comes to senior living. One that comes to mind is the negative connotations that color the statement “sending them to a home.” We have to realize that the nursing homes of the past have changed dramatically in recent years to better accommodate and create a more residential environment for older adults. Many older relatives can even live with their families or in a separate home that does not involve any of the mentioned living communities above. However, for the purposes of mythbusting, here are a few tidbits about senior housing.
Senior housing is not for all older people. While we may believe that we know what’s best for the older relatives in our lives, it’s important to also get their feedback as well. There’s no gain in infantilizing older adults and treating them like babies — they’re people, just like us. In hindsight, older adults don’t just sit around reading or playing golf or hanging around the shuffleboard area. They do many of the same things that we do, so let’s not limit them to just what we see on movies or in the media. 
Senior housing is fluid. Sometimes, older adults may need to transition from one place to another just to find the right fit. Moreover, as mentioned before, maybe senior housing just isn’t for them in the first place. 
Yes, senior housing can also be incredibly expensive. However, many of these communities are happy to plan out financial details with you as you’re preparing or researching. There are plenty of consultants and elder-care professionals that can assist you. 
There is no doubt isolation can be an issue — now more than ever. Even older adults living at home outside of these communities can experience social isolation given the state of the pandemic. In many cases, this probably stems from a lack of immediate relatives or the inability for family members to visit due to scheduling conflicts and protocol restrictions. However, many communities provide older adults with a vast range of activities, from practicing meditation to showing movies, in socially distanced spaces that allow for interaction and discussion.
All in all, there is certainly plenty of research that needs to be done prior to making any senior housing decisions, but I hope that this short sneak-peak helps out a bit. In the future, our children or relatives may have to make the same decisions (with our consultation of course), making us wonder about how much senior housing has changed and thinking, “Back in my day….”

Days after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert infamously touched all the microphones at a press conference in a perceived act of humor, Gobert became “Patient Zero” for the coronavirus in the NBA on March 11. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver took swift action and suspended the season that same day. 
For months, there were debates on whether the NBA season would resume. As the number of cases kept rising in the nation and the world, many other organizations such as the MLB and NCAA had to suspend or cancel their seasons, and the chances seemed bleak that the NBA would return.
There could have been a scenario in which we didn’t get a chance to see the Los Angeles Lakers go for their 17th championship and LeBron James further solidify his legacy. However, the NBA, as well as the WNBA and NHL, went to work and successfully conducted one of the most intriguing experiments in sports and medical history by creating the bubble. 
The WNBA stayed at the athletically prestigious IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. and played a shortened season until Oct. 6, when legend Sue Bird and the Seattle Storm picked up their fourth national title. 
One of the most critical events during their time in the bubble was when a couple of Seattle Storm players had their tests come back as inconclusive just a few hours prior to their semi-finals matchup against the Minnesota Lynx. Instead of rolling the dice and letting the game happen, the league acted swiftly and postponed the game instead of threatening an outbreak.
Going up north to Orlando, the NBA held its final eight regular season games and normal playoff series at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World. Both leagues implemented strict coronavirus protocols, and most of the players followed them. However, there were some players in the NBA who didn’t act in accordance. 
For instance, Houston Rockets forward Danuel House Jr. brought an unauthorized guest into his hotel room in September during the Rockets’ playoff series against the Lakers. Instead of wasting time and deliberating over this case, the NBA kicked House Jr. out of the bubble for not complying with protocol. On a less severe note, Sacramento Kings center Richaun Holmes was forced to quarantine for 10 days before the resumption of play because he left the bubble to pick up a food delivery. 
Unlike the NBA’s swift decision-making, the MLB was slow to react to cases in their league, in particular, the Miami Marlins. At least one of the Marlins players went out into the city during their stay in Atlanta in late July which led to an outbreak in the team to around 17 other players. Rather than strictly forbidding players to leave the hotel or at least forcing them to quarantine away from the rest of the team, the Marlins and MLB’s poor mismanagement put the season into jeopardy late in the summer.
On the topic of testing, if you got a chance to watch one of the vlogs by Philadelphia 76ers rookie Matisse Thybulle or recent NBA champion Lakers center Javale McGee, they show you a firsthand look into how rigorous daily testing is in the bubble with a dedicated staff to properly swab every player, staff, employee, etc. 
Silver and WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert should be applauded for their efforts along with all their league staff that worked on making their bubbles possible despite the stresses of the pandemic in the U.S. Even though the cases keep rising in the nation, they both showed that with proper leadership and strategy, as well as a responsible population, safety can be maintained.   
Doctors have also overwhelmingly agreed that the precautions the NBA took are much safer than leagues that are still traveling across the nation, such as MLB and the NFL. 
“The reason is the bubble versus not the bubble,” said Dr. Benjamin Linas, an epidemiologist and associate professor of infectious diseases at Boston University. “The NBA and NHL have demonstrated if you really require it, you can do it.”
I wished that the Pac-12 and USC kept some type of bubble system for the shortened football season like the NBA to limit the spread of the virus. But if the NFL and other conferences weren’t going to, it was unlikely that the Pac-12 would change. 
What is important in the creation of this bubble was that it was centralized by one governing league, rather than giving each team more responsibility with testing and coronavirus protocols like in the NFL. 
Unfortunately, money and ratings influence sports leagues, such as the NFL, to neglect the safety of players and their surrounding community. Specifically, many NFL teams are insistent on playing in their home stadiums and want to bring fans for increased revenue and higher ratings because they want to replicate the normal football experience before the pandemic which can’t happen in a bubble format.
Although NBA viewership dipped in the bubble, as seen by the 51% decrease in ratings during the Finals compared to last year, we still got a chance to see history in the making with the Lakers and the amazing run by the fifth-seeded Miami Heat all while maintaining health and safety. It was (hopefully) a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness the bubble and its successes in containing the virus’ spread.
