Jenny Chung | Daily TrojanMind over matter · Organizations including the Disability Services and Programs, Office for Wellness and Health Promotion and Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services helped students at the fair.
Students learned about available resources both on and off campus for combating mental health issues at the Mental Health Resource Fair that took place on Trousdale Parkway Monday morning. The fair, which was part of October’s Mental Health Awareness Month, was organized by the Undergraduate Student Government’s Academic Culture Assembly.
The ACA, which is made up of 12 member organizations, aims to cultivate academic curiosity in students. Mental Health Awareness Month aims to overcome the stigma related to mental health and help students talk about their issues. This year’s student-led campaign theme is “Self Care and Community Care.”
The Mental Health Resource Fair included the participation of representatives from various organizations like Student Counseling Services, The Painted Brain, Disability Services and Programs, Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, Asian Pacific American Student Services, Student Support and Advocacy, the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion, Breathe SC and the Occupational Therapy Faculty Practice Clinic. Students were able to chat with the representatives and learn about the resources and services they provide.
The Student Counseling Services provides individual counseling, group counseling and psychiatry services. They also offer outreach programs where they arrange educational workshops on a range of topics. There are several groups that are offered by them where students get to share their experiences and relieve anxiety and stress. They organize events like yoga apart from other stress-reducing activities. They also have drop-in hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. for emergencies, where students can walk in and ask to meet any counselor to discuss their concerns. For non-emergencies, a student needs to schedule an appointment. Apart from this, they also have crisis therapists who are available 24/7 to help students.
The Disability Services and Programs’ goal is to help students with disabilities gain an equal standing in all facets of their experiences at USC. They offer a variety of support services and students can utilize them by registering with them on their website.
“Our office is to help students be as successful as they can be,” said Sourena Haj-Mohamadi, a postdoctoral fellow at Disability Services and Programs. “They have great strengths and challenges and our office is to help those students.”
The Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services provides confidential counseling to students who have experienced any kind of sexual or gender-based harm during their stay at USC. RSVP has created a peer outreach program called Violence Outreach Intervention and Community Empowerment that engages students in preventing sexual violence and gender discrimination and also supports students who have gone through this trauma.
Shannon Lam, a sophomore majoring in human biology and gender studies, is a member of VOICE who spoke on the program’s impact on the USC community.
“[VOICE] is a great program that a lot of different communities can use,” Lam said. “[For example], they can have us give a presentation to get the message out to different cultural groups on campus. We are open to people coming out to us and we want to help them and spread awareness about relationships and sexual violence.”
The Asian Pacific American Student Services engages Asian and Pacific American students in a dialogue and facilitates their participation in order to empower them. They are also offering in-house counseling, every Friday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., in which they will bring people from the Office for Health and Wellness Promotion to help students. They want to have counselors and therapists of color, because that would be more impactful in helping students who look like them, according to Alex Kanegawa, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development.
“I think what the Academic Culture Assembly is doing is really great,” Kanegawa said. “Their idea of a holistic student involves mental, physical and emotional well-being, and they are taking a great amount of steps to provide resources and give all the support that a student might need.”
The Office for Wellness and Health Promotion organizes “happy hour,” which seeks to promote a healthy environment at USC, and wants to help students manage stress and develop self-care skills. These classes are free and include yoga and other stress relief exercises. They also have a program called “Pause for Paws” that involves a visit from a therapy dog once a week on campus, where students can engage with dogs and reduce their stress levels.
There is also an open group meditation program called Breathe SC that takes place every Monday from 1 to 2 p.m. and every Thursday from 2 to 3 p.m. at Thornton Quad. It is organized by Natalie Raphael, one of the co-founders of BreatheSC.
“We don’t necessarily guide you, but we give you a space where you can just calm yourself down and focus on your breath and feel a sense of stillness,” Raphael said. “I used to have really bad anxiety and worry about things for no reason, and meditation has taught me to feel this sense of stillness and not worry about the past or future but focus on the present.”
Nitya Pydipati, a data informatics graduate student, believes students must attend such events to know the services and programs that USC provides so that they can utilize them.
“I think it is great that we have so many facilities here at USC and students can greatly benefit from them,” Pydipati said. “We need to overcome the stigma that surrounds mental health issues, and students should approach these organizations to overcome problems and discuss their issues.”

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanTruth or consequences · Ted Steinberg led the discussion on the role of deceit and honesty in the presidential election at Monday’s event, which considered how Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are perceived by the public.
The Political Student Assembly hosted a discussion on the role of deception in the 2016 presidential election Monday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. 
The conversation focused on how the unfavorable public perception of the two presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, has been shaped by their deceit and what this distrust of elected officials says about the current state of politics in America.
Ted Steinberg, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development who led the discussion, said that the issue of accountability has come to the forefront of this year’s election, as each candidate has accused the other of lying. Issues such as Clinton’s use of a private email server to send classified information has made her appear dishonest, while many of Trump’s supporters focus on his willingness to state what they see as the “truth,” rather than try to make his speeches politically correct.
“I think that both candidates, especially Trump, have made it a focal point of their campaign to crack down on government malfeasance, and [Trump] has been trying to paint Clinton as the epitome of government corruption and malfeasance,” Steinberg said. “I think, in the process, he’s doing exactly what he says you shouldn’t do — have a government official who’s lying all the time.”
According to PolitiFact, 73 percent of Clinton’s statements are at least half truthful, whereas Trump’s statements have are mostly false 70 percent of the time. Madelynn Taras, the assistant director of PSA, said that when the presidential candidates at least partially lie 25 to 75 percent of the time, it is easy to see why many Americans, especially millennials who have just reached voting age, have become increasingly jaded by politics.
“A ‘truthful politician’ today is kind of an oxymoron,” Taras said. “I hope that the standard could be raised so that we’d be getting more truth out of politicians and really understanding where they stand on certain facts. But realistically, I don’t think that that would happen anytime soon.”
Steinberg said, however, that despite the feelings of distrust toward the government and politicians ingrained within the minds of Americans, it may be these same sentiments that spur on change in the next generation. 
“[I hope] we’re going to set ourselves to a higher standard and establish that the next generation of leaders is going to be about honesty, about transparency,” Steinberg said. “It’s a government for the people, by the people. There really shouldn’t be the divide that we have right now in terms of trust.”

Nine months pregnant, filmmaker and USC alumna Rachel Fleischer didn’t think that she would be doing so much work during her third trimester. 
“I think my unborn baby is giving me a lot of inspiration to do more good in the world,” Fleischer said. 
The good that Fleischer described has to do with her recent work directing a public service announcement supporting Proposition HHH, a bill on the Nov. 8 ballot that aims to end homelessness in Los Angeles.
Proposition HHH would provide $1.2 billion to build safe and clean housing in the city and would implement mental health and drug addiction treatment for homeless residents. Fleischer said she did not hear about this proposition until she was invited to speak at a panel on homelessness. 
“When I heard about it, I came to learn more about what it offered, and how it could help the homeless community,” Fleischer said. “Then I wondered, ‘If I’m a 35-year-old woman and I haven’t heard of it, then my friends definitely haven’t heard of it.’ So I decided to put together a short film.” 
The one-minute film, which was uploaded to YouTube, features several actors and actresses speaking about the importance of supporting Proposition HHH. One of the actors, Ty White, joined the initiative because of his feeling of personal connection to the issue of homelessness.
“It was close to the heart — I have friends and family who have been there,” White said. “Times are hard and life gets hard; and what Rachel did resonates with me because there are people who don’t have friends to help them out when life gets hard.”
Actress Madeline Zima said that her friendship with Fleischer was the reason she heard about the project, but that her personal desire to help end homelessness drove her to contribute. 
“I believe homelessness could happen to anyone,” Zima said. “Many people were just like you and me and had a stroke of bad luck that they just couldn’t turn around. Everyone deserves a second chance at a satisfying life.”
Fleischer said she didn’t start out as a documentarian of homelessness — before this PSA, she shot a short film and had made music videos and commercial segments. Instead, she sees herself as a storyteller foremost, and an activist afterwards. 
“I’m doing a lot of different things as a filmmaker,” Fleischer said. “I tend to not put myself in a box, but rather use my abilities as a filmmaker to satisfy my own impulses but to also bring awareness through my storytelling. What drives me is really the storytelling and helping make an impact.”
However, Fleischer said the Proposition HHH PSA is not her first or last experience with tackling homelessness in her work. In 2011, she released a film called Without a Home, which took five years to make. And in the future, Fleischer plans to release several short video segments of actors and actresses voicing their own personal takes on and experiences with homelessness. 
“I know that homelessness will be an issue that will always touch my heart and drive me to take action,” Fleischer said. “And one way I can do that is filmmaking and storytelling.”
A word to the wise:  Using the words honesty and politicians in the same sentence is an oxymoron.

Currently on a co-headlining tour with electronic music trio Autograf, Los Angeles-based music producer Josh Legg is a USC alumnus whose sun-soaked beats embody laid-back West Coast vibes. Known by his stage name Goldroom, Legg has recently released his highly anticipated debut album West of the West after the success of his four-track EP It’s Like You Never Went Away. In an exclusive interview with the Daily Trojan, Legg spoke about his new project and current tour.
Daily Trojan: In what ways did attending USC influence your career and your music?
Josh Legg: Music was always something I did on my own. I never thought it would become my profession. It was always something that was very private for me, but while I was at ’SC I started to record. I was writing sort of on my own, and my friend Kyle, who was in the music program, had gotten a copy of Logic, a digital audio workstation, and we bonded over that. So suddenly I had a much more powerful recording tool, and I started to write and record a lot more. It just so happened he was the guy I started a business with, a record label that took me down the path of becoming Goldroom. So without being at ‘SC and without Kyle working in the music program, I don’t think any of that stuff would’ve ended up happening.
DT: Can you tell me a little bit more about your record label Binary Entertainment?
JL: Yeah, it was an important time in my life. I think I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit. The fact that Goldroom exists is a testament to that. Kyle and I started Binary Entertainment because we thought that electronic music was going to become a big deal around the world, which ended up proving to be true. But, we attacked at the wrong time, and I don’t think that Los Angeles or the rest of the world was ready for what we were trying to do at that time. I have a lot of memories from 2009 of trying to throw shows on the Eastside. People would laugh us off the stage because the band we were working with had laptops and all this stuff, which at the time was weird. They just weren’t ready for it. However, we worked really hard and I learned a ton. Everything I learned led me to approach Goldroom from a prudent, smart perspective. Though the label never totally clicked, it was a great learning experience.
DT: Are there any musical influences in your life right now that have been affecting your recent work?
JL: It’s funny because when people ask me that question I answer in two ways. Half the time I just say flat out no because I like to think that usually the people that I’m going to for influence are from a long time ago. My heroes are classic songwriters like Tom Petty or Curtis Mayfield or Bob Dylan. These are the people that I really want to influence my songwriting the most. One of the most dangerous things you can do is chase trends and to think about what your peers are doing. But the funny thing is, I was a blogger for a long time. I love finding new music, and I’m a total digger. So I’m always finding tracks that inspire me and make me excited. A lot of my favorite new music is stuff that my friends are making. The Classixx album that came out earlier this year is fantastic. The list kind of goes on and on.
DT: How did this current co-headline tour with Autograf get put together?
JL: Essentially, it came together because we are both represented by the same agency. I wish that I had a more romantic story about it. We knew that we were going to be doing a tour this fall because I recently put out an album. I spent three years putting this record together, and it’s a real statement for me. I knew I needed a tour this fall, and the Autograf guys wanted to go on tour, so our agents played matchmaker and put us together.
DT: What do you want people to take away from your show?
JL:  When we play music and present ourselves in a live setting, it’s a full band show. There’s no mystery going on up there about where the sounds are coming from. We’re playing what you hear and singing the songs I wrote for everyone. There’s a lot of live electronic music DJs that are a dude behind a bunch of stuff, and it’s hard to know necessarily what’s going on. With us, I’m standing with a guitar in front of a microphone singing the songs. I’m really proud of the musicians I get to play with everyday so I hope people take away that it’s possible to play this kind of music in a live setting. It’s more meaningful and emotional to see somebody really pour their heart out with the music they’ve written themselves.
DT: In the past you’ve worked with Snapchat and created the full-length film It’s Like You Never Went Away. Do you have any plans to do something similar with the new album?
JL: Yeah, I’d love to do more stuff like that. One thing I did for this tour actually was I partnered with Bacardi and made a music video for “Lying To You.” But, I’m always interested in the technology aspect. We did a one-of-a-kind thing where we gave away tickets to the tour on my website. But, they were hidden in a way that no one had ever done on a website before. You could only access the secret page on the website if you were in HTML mode on Google Chrome. After we launched that, people spent a few days trying to find the hidden tickets and eventually people were able to. I like trying interesting technological things to go along with the music, so that was our little foray into that.
DT: Do you have a dream collaborator? Is there anyone specific you’d like to work with in the future?
JL: I would probably say that my dream collaborator is somebody that the world doesn’t know yet. I’ve always taken a real pride in finding up-and-coming singers that nobody has heard of. I get the opportunity to work with somebody who’s really hungry and introduce them to the world and help their career out. When I’m thinking about who I’m excited to write with next, I’m always daydreaming about the undiscovered gem. I’ve gotten the opportunity to work with some bigger names along the way, and that’s cool. I’m sure that I’ll to continue to do that as well, but my dream collaborator is a person I haven’t met yet or don’t know about.
DT: Do you have any advice for young musicians and music students that want to break into the industry?
JL: Years ago, everybody understood that you have to spend 10,000 hours learning an instrument and perfecting your craft, but now there’s the belief that if you have a laptop and learn Ableton, all you have to do is make one song. If it’s good enough, you can launch your career, and everything goes from there. But, my biggest piece of advice is to understand that what you’re going to make is probably going suck. It’s going to take you a long time to make something good. Even at this point in my life when I’ve made thousands of songs, for every 100 ideas I start, 99 of them suck. One of them is OK, and then, if I’m lucky, that turns into a finished product. You need perseverance and understanding that hard work is really important. Secondly, people should know that style and sound really don’t matter as much as good honest songwriting.
DT: So what’s next for you after the tour finishes?
JL: The muscle in my brain that really wants to songwrite is telling me to get back into the studio. I’m actually really excited to come off the tour and get in the studio right away, because there are remixes I want to work on. I’ve finished this record, so now I want to figure out what the next thing is. I also really want to start DJing again, because we’ve been playing live so much. DJing has always been super meaningful to me. When I started Goldroom the point was that I could DJ more, which is funny, because now it’s so much more than that.
Goldroom will perform in Los Angeles on Nov. 3 at The Novo.

Photo from Blue Note RecordsSingin’ the blues · John Coltrane was an American saxophonist and composer who was at the forefront of the “free jazz” movement in the 1950s and 1960s. His contemporaries included Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk.
My friends like to tease me by calling me a hipster. At first, it irritated me. The stereotypical hipster was something that angered me in high school, and to be associated with something like that was like a nightmare that came to life. However, after being called a hipster constantly through the years, I’ve learned to roll with the punches. Besides, they have a legitimate argument, since my favorite music genre is jazz.
Now, usually, they make fun of me for the well-known artists, like Miles Davis and John Coltrane. Anytime I mention someone not as popular, they act like I’m speaking a different language — some made-up hipster dialect that only other hipsters can understand. And despite my best efforts, most of the albums I try to show them only bring on more teasing. Except for one.
Blue Train was the second John Coltrane album that I listened to, and it’s the first jazz album I bought on vinyl. After being slightly underwhelmed by Giant Steps, I downloaded Blue Train on a Friday night my junior year of high school and played it on the 2 a.m. drive back from a friend’s house.
Giant Steps might not have been what I was looking for, but I definitely found out why Coltrane is a pioneer of sound when I listened to this album. The overall theme for this album, as you can probably tell, has to do with locomotives. Like any good conductor will tell you, it takes a lot of moving parts working together in unison to make a train run smoothly, and that’s just what this group of musicians does on this album, with Coltrane serving as the conductor to make sure everything runs smoothly.
When I saw the personnel for this album, I knew I was in for a ride. Anything with Lee Morgan, Paul Chambers and Coltrane together is a recipe for something special. For such a small group, it had a lot of star power to have on one album, but the beauty of the album comes from their ability to highlight each other’s playing style and work together. Each and every song on this album has an “all for one and one for all” mentality, with each player showcasing what they can do on their respective instrument without hogging the spotlight and being selfish. If anything, the spotlight might shine on Coltrane a bit brighter than the rest, but what else would you expect from a John Coltrane album?
Still, Coltrane has some great members to play alongside with on this album, even being upstaged by Curtis Fuller’s trombone in “I’m Old Fashioned.” For a slow ballad, you would think that Coltrane’s melodic sax would be better suited for the tune, but Fuller really shows the range of his trombone playing and gives Coltrane a run for his money. However, he still shows who’s boss on “Lazy Bird,” making use of his freestyle sax lines that are fast and furious, but play with purpose and resolve.
Each track on this album showcases impressive chops from each of the six members that make up the core on this outing, but the most impressive, and one of my favorite Coltrane songs, is “Moment’s Notice.” This track is so good; I’m honestly confused as to why Coltrane didn’t name the album after this song. It is the epitome of the synergistic theme that runs throughout the album, and it really shows how when each of these musicians get together and lend each other the best their talents have to offer, they make something that’s bigger than each of them combined. 
This track never fails to put a smile on my face, from the opening energetic Coltrane sax melody to the way drummer Philly Joe Jones keeps impeccable timing with his ride cymbal and perfectly timed snare hits. Coltrane’s long-form soloing never gets tiring, and Fuller’s trombone and Morgan’s trumpet keep the party going. Even Chambers’ bass and Kenny Drew’s piano solos are enough to keep the energy high. It’s as if each musician is having a friendly competition between their instruments: not exactly trying to outdo each other, but not trying to sound like the worst out of the group. 
My love for this song only grows the more I hear it and am able to pick out new nuances I didn’t hear before on previous listens. This song to me is like a stable group that you can always call up when you’re looking for something fun.
It also never fails to make good impressions on anyone I play it for, even for the people who don’t like jazz. One friend in particular, who does a fair amount of complaining and never hesitates to call my music choices hipster when given the chance, heard this song for the first time and gave me a validating “not bad.” It’s an understatement, but at least I’m not getting teased about it.

Photo from SparkSCArtistic value · Laura Krostovska-Guerrero, a senior majoring in global studies and a contemporary multimedia artist, will present her art at the event. She conveys themes, such as social justice, in her works.
On Nov. 11, USC’s talented student artists will join forces with Los Angeles’ artists to put on State of the Arts, a fair showcasing the student community’s artistic and creative innovations. The event will include exhibitions, keynote speakers, videos, interactive exhibits and food sampling.
Several USC students have been developing independent creative projects, which will be showcased at the event. One such artist is Michael Chang, a senior majoring in fine arts, who will have his own exhibition at the event. 
“I examine cultural intersections between people and objects in my artwork. Explorations manifest through various mediums including drawing, painting, collage, and graphic design,” Chang said. “I combine historical research and personal experiences to create speculative narratives that often in futuristic, fictionalized realities.”
Another exhibition will be hosted by Laura Krstovska-Guerrero, a senior majoring in global studies. A multimedia artist, she discusses topics of social justice, identity and her background. She uses the recurring motif of a palm tree to represent the complex issues that she tackles. Her senior thesis explores the experience of artists of color at USC.
Melisa Seah, a freshman majoring in business administration and founder of Classic Revivals, will have an exhibit on the fashion industry and sustainability. Her brand utilizes eco-friendly materials and fair labor practices to create socially conscious clothing. 
The interactive exhibits portion of the event will have booths for attendees to pitch their own ideas. USC’s 1000 Pitches booth will be there, an on-campus competition for student entrepreneurs to develop their ideas and win a prize of $1,000. 
Hosted by SparkSC, USC’s entrepreneurship and innovation club, State of the Arts aims to inspire entrepreneurial spirit among aspiring artists. Fostering a culture of creativity has been a goal for this student organization and many others on campus, such as Visions and Voices and LavaLab.
Additionally, the University has invested many resources into integrating entrepreneurship as an academic concentration. The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies is the oldest institute of its kind and the joint minor in Innovation: The Digital Entrepreneur, was co-established by the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Marshall School of Business to prepare students interested in business and innovation. Additionally, the Iovine and Young Academy, established in 2014, combines arts, business and technology to foster the spirit of entrepreneurship.
SparkSC hosted an event last year called Arts, Grooves and Foods. The event attracted over 450 people throughout campus. State of the Arts aims to build upon that audience and expand the reach of the entrepreneurship club. 
The event will take place in the Fishbowl Chapel at from 4 to 8 p.m, and is free and open to the public.

Coming off a blowout of Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and an upset of No. 2 California last week, the No. 3 men’s water polo team had a couple of players bring home hardware for their efforts in extending the Trojans’ win streak to 10 games.
Junior driver Matteo Morelli was named the MPSF Player of the Week and freshman two-meter Matt Maier took home MPSF Newcomer of the Week honors. It is Morelli’s first selection as player of the week and Maier’s second honor as the top newcomer in the league for the week. 
Morelli was the star in the 10-6 win over Cal at Uytengsu Aquatics Center last Saturday, recording four goals, two assists and two steals. Morelli scored the game’s first goal three minutes in to set the tone, and then netted an insurance goal in the fourth quarter to give the Trojans a three-goal lead.
The junior also had a hat trick against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps last Thursday, a 22-2 win for USC. Morelli recorded the first three goals of the game along with two assists and a steal. His 33 goals puts him second on team in scoring behind junior Blake Edwards, who has 36. 
Maier scored twice last week, once in each game. He had a goal and an assist in the win over Cal, with his goal putting USC ahead 5-3. He has 15 goals on the season, scoring in 11 games.
The Trojans sport an 18-1 record and are perfect at home. They wrap up the regular season at home with games against San Jose State on Sunday and UCLA on Nov. 12.

Being a female in sports journalism is hard for a number of reasons. While I’ve had the privilege of working with a number of great female reporters here at USC, I know that out in the real world, those numbers fall dramatically. It’s hard working in a field that’s entirely male-dominated. 
The Women’s Media Center publishes “The Status of Women in U.S. Media,” which annually reviews numbers from various media platforms — news, broadcast, film, television, radio, sports, magazines, digital, tech, gaming and social media. In their 2015 status report, the WMC concluded that “media on all platforms are failing women.” 
The WMC found that while women make up more than half the population, they report on far fewer stories than men. According to the report, women report on camera for the broadcast evening news about 32 percent of the time, appear in print 37 percent of the time and report on online news 42 percent of the time. When women are reporting, they’ll mostly write about education, health and lifestyle. They’re left out of the majority of coverage on topics like economics, sports, politics and technology. 
Looking just at sports, Talkers magazine publishes the “Heavy Hundred” that ranks radio talk show hosts; there’s a list for sports hosts and news hosts. Only two women made the sports list, and 12 women made the news list. The two women in 2014 were Fox Sports Radio’s Amy Van Dyken-Rouen and CBS Sports Radio Network’s Dana Jacobson; they’re the same two that only made the list in 2013 as well. Neither women report alone — they’re both joined by male commentators. In 2015, there was one woman on the sports list: CBS Sports Radio Network’s Amy Lawrence. 
Of the 78.8 percent of broadcast news stations that responded to a survey in 2014, 58.8 percent of employees are men while 41.2 percent are women, which is a slight uptick from 40.3 percent in 2013. Of all TV news directors, 30.8 percent are women, which is an improvement from the 28.7 percent in 2013 and a record high. Women general managers made up 20.4 percent, a 2.6 percent increase since 2013, also a record high. 
So, there’s an optimistic angle here. The increase in women managers and directors will eventually lead to an increase in women reporters. These women in leadership and production roles can pave the way for those younger than them to be successful in the field. That is something that can start as early as the college level. 
I had the pleasure of working Annenberg’s Discover USC event. As sports director for Annenberg Media, I was able to talk to a plethora of prospective students about the opportunities available for pursuing sports journalism at USC. After the first couple of hours meeting and mingling with students and their families, I was impressed that I talked with a greater number of women than men. There’s the optimism. As more women pursue sports journalism, the ratio in the professional world will eventually even out. It’s going to take time, but it’s entirely possible. 
As a woman holding a leadership position and working as a reporter, I’ve had a number of encounters where I’ve been talked down to, brushed off or invalidated simply because of my gender. It’s frustrating to deal with, but, unfortunately, it’s a part of the job and something that I’ve learned to deal with since I started reporting in my first year at USC. I do believe that those instances have made me a tougher and better reporter, teaching me to hold my ground and stay firm in my opinions. 
After meeting all of the prospective students, working alongside my female peers at USC and following in the shadows of the people that I look up to in the industry, I have hope that slowly things are changing. We have the ability to pave a course for those younger than us to have success in the industry and to not have to endure the inequity we are faced with today. 
One day, being a female sports reporter won’t be rare, and the job will be difficult only for the reasons it should be difficult: crazy work schedules and the strain of travel.

Daily Trojan file photoFriendly fire · Senior Nick Crystal (above) lost to freshman teammate Brandon Holt in the singles championship of the SoCal Intercollegiate.
In a Trojan vs. Trojan match for the title, freshman Brandon Holt defeated senior Nick Crystal to claim the singles championship at the Southern California Intercollegiate at Marks Stadium on Monday afternoon.
Holt won in straight sets (6-4, 6-3) over his teammate. In fact, he advanced through the latter stages of tournament — which began on Friday — via friendly fire. The last three matches came against fellow Trojans; Holt defeated freshman Riley Smith in the quarterfinals on Saturday and junior Thibault Forget in the semifinals on Sunday to advance to the finals.
The freshman continues to be on a tear, as he has now won 10 straight matches; he carried a five-match winning streak into the tournament. He also swept every set at the tournament, winning all 10 sets he played. The 6-foot-1 Holt was the No. 1 recruit out of high school as a senior out of Palos Verdes High School and was also named the 2015 Breeze Player of the Year.
Holt was robbed of a chance to take home more hardware from the tournament, as he and Smith advanced to the finals in doubles, only to have the match canceled. Rain postponed the match on Sunday and their opponents — Alexander Sendegeya and Bjorn Thomson from Texas Tech — could not stay to reschedule the match to Monday.

USC football enters preparations for the Oregon game on a positive note: The Trojans are on a four-game winning streak, are tied for second in the Pac-12 and are heavily favored against the Ducks on Saturday.
Furthermore, the Trojans climbed up in the AP poll to their best position since falling out of the Top 25 after losing to Alabama to open the season. USC received 40 votes in this week’s rankings, placing them behind only Houston (65 votes) as the team receiving the most votes outside the Top 25.
Four teams from the Pac-12 are ranked in the Top 25 — Washington, which beat Utah on Saturday, remains at No. 4, while the Utes are now 16th. Colorado comes in at No. 21 after a bye week, and Washington State made its first appearance in rankings, climbing to No. 25. 
With Utah losing to Washington, the Trojans are now tied with the Utes for second in the Pac-12 South, as both teams hold 4-2 records. Colorado is alone in first with a record of 4-1.
After beginning the season 1-3, USC has beaten Arizona State, Colorado, Arizona and Cal to bring its record to a respectable 5-3. But the Trojans do not control their own fate. To clinch the Pac-12 South, they have to win the remainder of their games and have both Utah and Colorado lose at least once.
The Trojans are favored by two touchdowns against Oregon on Saturday. The Ducks have struggled this season with a 3-5 record, and this marks the first time USC has faced an Oregon team with a losing record since 1982. A win would likely boost the Trojans back into the AP Top 25 before they take on Washington on the road. 
USC hasn’t beaten Oregon at the Coliseum since 2008, though the Trojans have won seven straight games at home. The game will kickoff at 4 p.m. on Saturday and air on ESPN.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanIn good hands · Senior running back Justin Davis will depart USC after this season, but the Trojans’ run game looks intact with sophomores Ronald Jones II (above) and Aca’Cedric Ware waiting in the wings.
Despite USC going into last week’s game against Cal as 20-point favorites, there was concern in the Trojan camp leading up to the contest. Most of the pre-game discussion focused on the threat of Cal quarterback Davis Webb, who was coming off a five-touchdown day versus Oregon. But head coach Clay Helton and his squad were also missing tailback Justin Davis, a four-year stalwart in the USC backfield. With the senior sidelined for the second straight game nursing a high-ankle sprain, the Trojans needed someone to fill in as a key cog in their offense.
Enter Ronald Jones II and Aca’Cedric Ware. In Davis’ absence, the sophomores have established themselves as two more workhorses out of the storied Trojan stable. “RoJo” needs no introduction, having already burst onto the scene with over 1,000 total yards in his freshman campaign. Ware, on the other hand, had compiled 177 yards in his entire collegiate career before leading the team with 103 two weeks ago at Arizona.
But if either Jones or Ware was anonymous before, certainly neither is now after their performances on Thursday. Both running backs enjoyed career nights; Ware followed up his day in Tucson with 130 rushing yards against Cal, and Jones gashed the Golden Bears to the tune of 223 and a touchdown.
“It’s great,” Jones said. “We waited for this opportunity. With Justin being down, we knew we were going to have to pick up the slack.” 
Shrugging off superlatives, the McKinney, Texas native made sure to credit his teammates for his big day. 
“We had a great offensive line all night,” he said. “The receivers, everybody, just came together.”
Ware echoed Jones’ praise and said the duo has been pushing each other to improve all season long. 
“Me and Ronald continue to compete. We’re both from Texas; that’s why we were born with a competitive edge,” Ware said. “To come out here and do what [Jones] did tonight — I’m proud of that man.”
It’s no secret that Helton loves to dictate the game’s tempo by running the football, so having a wealth of weapons behind redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold is a great fit for the head coach’s system. The Trojans have gained the majority of their yardage via the run in their two games without Davis, and in a season during which much of the buzz has centered on the passing attack, it may be the ground game that powers USC through the stretch run. It certainly did so against Cal.
“He’s a special dude,” Helton said of Jones. “The talent that he has and the person that he is and the competitiveness that he has — you knew he was getting ready to explode.”
Jones will hope to build off his strong performance after what some deemed a slow start to his second year at USC. In 2015, he became one of only two Trojans to lead the team in season rushing as a true freshman (LenDale White first achieved the feat in 2003), but he was on pace to fall well short of rookie numbers before his second breakout against Cal. With 508 rushing yards and four regular-season games left to play, Jones has a shot to eclipse the millennium mark on the ground for the first time as a Trojan.
Davis could very well return this week, but Jones and Ware have also likely played their way into more touches. No matter how the timeshare shakes out, Helton will frequently exploit his offensive line’s strength in the trenches.
“To be able to establish the run game at the point of attack, I think, is huge,” Helton said after Thursday’s game. “[We] rushed for 398 yards tonight. As we say, big men win games.”
The Trojans’ three-headed monster will look to feast on another enticing matchup on Saturday. Oregon visits the Coliseum giving up the 11th most rushing yards out of 128 FBS teams — Cal gives up the most — but the Ducks did manage to snap a five-game losing streak last weekend with a win over Arizona State.
Davis and Jones combined for 197 yards and one touchdown on the ground when USC lost in Eugene last year. They will undoubtedly demand a better performance of themselves on Saturday, while Ware gets his first shot at the Oregon defense.

The Malheur raiders and Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have fundamentally the same aim. That aim is opposition to the big government, big business, industrial-bureaucratic complex that is the New Deal state. The Malheur raiders approached it from a libertarian-populist and Jacksonian “religion,” while the pipeline protesters approached it from an ecotopian-localist and New Left “religion.” But politically, their aim is the same: Limit the scope of the industrial-bureaucratic complex that includes such leviathan organizations as the Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management, the corporate oil industry and the construction industry. However, each exhibits faulty methods of obstructionism shifting away from the focus. They oppose that jumble of institutions on principle, because it impedes the practice of — or at least, provides an insult to — the “religions” each group follows. 
And what are these “religions” in either case?
The protesters’ faith is what we might call “ecotopian localism,” or the notion that smaller is better in all institutions and that mankind ought to live in total cyclic harmony with nature rather than exploiting it. And this green religion, of course, is fundamentally hostile to big oil on two counts:  first, that it’s big, corporate and profit-oriented, and second, that it’s based on a carbon-emitting dirty fuel that powers modern capitalism and changes the temperature of the atmosphere. 
Does this match the actual Sioux religion? It’s doubtful. (Note that a good portion of the protesters come from around the country and overseas and are presumably not Sioux.) But wouldn’t it be convenient and self-gratifying to portray this incident as though a group of ethically superior Native Americans are out there in the field conforming to our enlightened cosmopolitan views on climate change and corporate greed? Give us a break, Bill McKibben.
As anti-government white populists, the Bundy clan and their followers practice something you could loosely call “Jacksonian constitutionalism.” They worship and adore the United States Constitution, or at least its Second Amendment (because that’s the important part, right?) and, if they’ve read a bit more, they view Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson as the progressive infiltrators who subverted the constitutional system and put America on the “road to serfdom.” (But they’ve read Friedrich Hayek’s book as often as they’ve read our founding document — that is, perhaps a quote from the internet or two, if at all.)
Their main interest and religion, subconsciously held, is a golden dream of a small-government, laissez-faire, largely white America that never existed. But they believe it existed and commit acts of violence and even treason to make a point.  They think “the government” never did any good; they don’t realize that “the government” was what turned the West from a quiet frontier to one of the country’s most vibrant and vital regions.
The pipeline protesters have been lionized in the mainstream press, a press that is still unknowingly thinking about Native Americans as the stars of Avatar. The Bundys and other Malheur raiders have justly been demonized, though far-right sites continue to justify their actions and occasionally endorse them.
Thus, the basic currents of American public discourse no longer emphasize and promote the centralized big-government, big-business collaboration that built America and made us great. On the left, hatred of the profit motive and a disdain for the very idea of American greatness crowd out otherwise-rational big-government economics. On the right, cuckoo, voodoo economics and a paranoia about anything smacking of “big government” rejects the New Deal heritage. As a result, there are few people left to stand up for the basic pillars of our prosperity and our security.
The basic model of the New Deal was a form of big-government corporatism — “how can each relevant stakeholder get what they need and have their voice be heard, in such a way that the broader public interests unites the private interests of all relevant stakeholders?”
Under such a system, modernized, the Bundys’ shrill cries for “limited government” would be merely one voice at a table of other voices, each seeking particular policy goals for their factions. The pipeline protesters’ sheer obstructionism would give way to negotiation between various interested groups, including environmentalists, land management agencies, oil industries, construction unions and others.
Of course, the pipeline protesters and Bundys would be invited to the table, provided they exhibited good behavior rather than the protest tactics both have been employing. They would deserve to have a hand in the process.
But no interest group deserves a final say over any matter. Politics in a free republic is a game of give-and-take, the art of the compromise and obstructionists who demand the submission of all other factions to their goals, however pure, are not fit to participate in democratic politics.

It is important that access to birth control is easy, cheap and quick. These were the guiding factors behind California’s unanimously passed SB 493, allowing pharmacists in the state to have full authority to distribute hormonal contraception such as the pill, patch, ring and shot without prescription. However, a lack of implementation is apparent at the University of California, Irvine.
Melody Ling | Daily Trojan
An op-ed written by three law students at UC Irvine complained of the university’s unwillingness to comply with the law. Despite concerted efforts, the University required the girls to schedule appointments, meet with physicians and undergo pelvic exams — a policy they later waived — despite the change that the law was supposed to bring. Though health center pharmacists can’t prescribe birth control without a prescription, there is no self-screening available and the wait to begin birth control is ridiculously long.
 The university is required to comply with the law, but maintains restrictions that do not allow it to implement the law completely — introducing only aspects of it. Administration believes that the protocol will burden students with long pharmacy wait times — hypocritically enough, not unlike the queues at existing pharmacies under current policies. They say that hiring more pharmacists to alleviate overcrowding wouldn’t be a good financial decision. However, such reasoning is clearly unfounded. There is no evidence to support the school’s claims, and there is already a long wait to see a physician for the same.
 Additionally, the university has argued for birth-control barriers like pelvic examinations before a prescription can be issued. The pelvic examination process was eliminated after students pointed out that the exams were not cost effective (as girls don’t seek them). So, having annual exams (that the medical community has said should not be a prerequisite for birth control), which remain expensive,  is not a great decision. After concerted effors, this has finally reached the ears of authorities.
 There are some who say that these exams also check for unknown cancers or infections that might go unnoticed. While that is a valid worry, it does not take into acount that the same could be said of any and every other body part. This doesn’t mean we live in anxiety and schedule bi-weekly medical check-ups. These people forget the importance of the bill and how its implementation would reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancy. It would also offer incentive to someone who doesn’t want to schedule an appointment with a primary care physician to go on birth control.
 Currently, some UC students pay transportation costs to go to pharmacies farther away from campus that have specially licensed and educationally trained pharmacists who allow them to access birth control easily, though at a higher cost. 
Women in today’s world must demand equality, and having to ask for permission from someone or being answerable to someone to start or continue being on birth control is not indicative of social or political equality. The law in a way is supposed to help them overcome patriarchy by giving them control over their bodies and what they do with them ,but the school not adopting it makes them feel otherwise. The tone of the op-ed that the three UC Irvine students wrote reflected the same principles.
 If the University of California system completely adopted SB 493, birth control would be easy, cheap and quick, making the college community less prone to unwanted pregnancies. It would change the lives of many young girls who currently find it hard to access birth control.

On Friday, USC students gathered at the Tutor Campus Center to enjoy vegan Indian food and view a screening of the 2011 documentary Forks Over Knives. The event was hosted by USC’s Vegetarian and Vegan Club and featured catering from No Tomatoes. 
The film was an advocacy project in which two scientists promote a whole-foods, plant-based diet. The main theme of the film was the power of food and the way in which it can cure or reverse certain diseases. 
The scientists featured in the film, T. Colin Campbell and Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr., believe that a diet of animal protein turns on cancer and other diseases, such as coronary artery disease, which leads to heart attacks and strokes. They also say that a whole-foods, plant-based diet can stop, and in some cases, reverse diseases. 
Duncan Gammie, a senior majoring in computer science, is not vegetarian or vegan and loves eating meat. 
“I came here to be persuaded. I’m not a vegan, I’m not a vegetarian. I’m a full-on meat-eater,” Gammie said. “I’m just here to expand my mind and to see new possibilities.”
Silence fell over the room as a quote from Hippocrates, “Let food be thy medicine,” appeared on the screen and marked the beginning of the movie. Students were captivated by the information being presented. 
The film ended to a resounding applause throughout the room and conversation immediately broke out. 
Kathryn Bolton, a junior majoring in environmental studies and NGOs and social change, is a firm believer in the message of the film. 
“Whole-foods, plant-based diet is the key and the answer to all of our problems, ever,” she said. 
Most students appeared excited at the end of the film. Jennifer Cui, a freshman and World Bachelor of Business student, was glad she attended the screening. She compared Forks Over Knives to other documentaries known to have a similar message. 
“I’ve watched Cowspiracy and Earthlings before, and those focus on different aspects. It’s an easy documentary to watch — it wasn’t off-putting to people,” Cui said. “I think it really helps open people’s eyes to the whole health-aspect and help people understand why someone would chose a dietary identity as vegan or vegetarian.” 
Arjun Reddy, the vice president of the Trojan Vegetarian and Vegan Club, was pleased with the turnout of students and the conversation the film inspired. 
“We wanted people to know the benefits of shifting to a plant-based diet. We know that a lot of people at USC, or even coming to this event, aren’t necessarily vegan or vegetarian,” he said. “We’re hoping this promotes a plant-based lifestyle and [students] can make some small switches to incorporate more plants and to reduce the meat consumption and dairy consumption in their life.” 
It is great that events such as this have people thinking about sustainability, and the health of our planet.  It is important, however, to recognize that veganism, in principle, often opposes environmentalism.  Veganism, for example, accepts the consumption of any plant-based product simply because it contains no animal parts.  Never mind that many of these products require more resources to produce than many sources of meat.  Cashews and almonds, for example, require more water to grow than does chicken.  Wild fish and game may be taken at a sustainable rate from undamaged lands with no harm to animal populations or the habitat that supports them.  The same cannot be said for any form of agriculture, which  necessarily destroys every individual, of every species, on the landscape converted to that purpose. Ironically, even though well-regulated hunting and fishing can reduce animal death in comparison to agriculture, veganism insists of the route of greater death and destruction, somehow as a matter of “principle.”  
To a vegan, it matters not how many creatures die, but rather HOW they die.  In this regard, veganism and environmentalism often find themselves at odds.  Studies have shown that the diet imposing the least environmental impact will include at least some meat–that which may be taken from the wild or grown using the inedible by-products of plant agriculture that will otherwise go to waste.
