The university has been known for its thriving Greek community, with about thousands of undergraduates in a fraternity and sorority, and has, in recent years, topped several national lists for being an LGBTQ-friendly campus. Still, members of both communities recognize a divide and dissonance in their intersection.
Common ground · Queer and Ally Student Assembly Director Mellissa Linton discusses the intersection of the LGBTQ and Greek communities. – Shabnam Ferdowsi | Daily Trojan
Every month, a group of out, closeted and questioning Greek students gather to discuss the interaction of USC’s lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender and queer community with the Greek community, in a Greek Chat hosted by the LGBT Resource Center. The Queer and Ally Student Assembly hosted one such discussion at the Alpha Delta Pi house Wednesday night.
[Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that the event, hosted by the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, was the same as the monthly LGBT Resource Center event. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
About 15 students who identify with one or both communities shared their experiences and thoughts on the growing population of Greek actives who also identify as LGBTQ.
The discussion, put on and led by assistant director of QuASA Liz Soriano, made clear that both groups are tangibly divided. Attendants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, were almost entirely unanimous in saying that much must be done to bridge the gap between the Greek system and the LGBTQ community. Miscommunication and ignorance are seemingly prevalent on both sides.
“People at USC don’t hate gay people, but gay people don’t necessarily fit in with the USC Greek system,” said a gay junior in a fraternity.
One gay senior in a fraternity said it was difficult to be a member of both communities.
“As a Greek person and as a gay person, I feel that I have been attacked, in some respect, for both identities,” he said.
On the other hand, lesbian students said they felt the Greek system is particularly hostile.
“What makes me uncomfortable about the Greek system is the rampant misogyny,” said a lesbian junior who is not in the Greek system.
The group also discussed National Coming Out Day, held on Oct. 11. The consensus of the group was that sororities had been much more receptive to the LGBTQ community, even though there are more openly gay men in fraternities than openly lesbian women in sororities.
One student attributed it to larger acceptance of gay men in the United States.
“Gay men are glorified way more on this campus than lesbians,” said one lesbian who is not in the Greek system. “That’s not a USC thing, that’s a country thing.”
One lesbian student in a sorority, who joked that she is the only Greek lesbian, said certain events reveal the divide between gay students and Greek students.
“Parties are when the antagonism between the Greek community and the gay community becomes most apparent,” she said.
On the other hand, gay members of fraternities said acceptance varied from fraternity to fraternity.
“I was denied from a frat because they thought I was girly,” said one gay member of a fraternity.
One openly gay freshman, however had a better experience having rushed fraternities during spring rush and received a bid from one of them.
“There are some frats that seem very, very straight,” he said. “And there are a few that seem more comfortable with the idea of homosexuality in the group.”
According to him, the emphasis on heterosexual relationships plays a large role in the fraternity culture, which can be a tremendous deterrent for LGBTQ members who are interested in rushing.
“I’m not sure if I will end up taking the bid – I’m still thinking about it but am a bit reluctant.”
At the same time, LGBTQ students remain interested in Greek life.
“There’s a lot of curiosity on both sides,” said a gay freshman in a fraternity. “I see it all the time.”
Not all students present spoke on the condition of anonymity. Claire Pires, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and theatre, was raised by two mothers and has been a lifelong supporter of the LGBTQ community. Though she recognizes the merits of the Greek system, she also acknowledges a stigma toward homosexuality — particularly among female Greeks.
“I know a few gay boys in fraternities, but no gay people in sororities,” Pires said. “I just don’t think that gay people tend to flock towards Greek life. Greek life can be quite traditional. That can make it fun, but it also doesn’t necessarily appeal to the gay community.”
QuASA Director Mellissa Linton emphasized the necessity of discussions like this one to bridge the gap between the LGBTQ and Greek communities.
“I really hope that panels like this can set a precedent for communication and understanding between the two groups,” she said.
There a couple of lower tier houses with out gay guys.   Top tier gays are all in the closet.
We are kidding ourselves if we think a few ice cream socials at a sororislut house makes a difference with the drunk boys on 28th street.  Get real people!!  A queer here and there at Beta, Lambda, or Phi Psi means nothing!  Especially when they hide behind the Bi or Questioning label.  I mean come on!  Until the greek system as a whole – and that means the pathetically straight homophobes like TKE and SAE accept us for who we are.  We should have nothing to do with them.  No dialogue.  Just be real!
Looks like Phi Delt final got a social function with at least two girls.  Congrats boys!   The straight ones will following in time…
To clarify, Greek Chat is sponsored by the LGBT Resource Center – a department within Student Affairs. For more information, visit: http://sait.usc.edu/lgbt/signature-programs/greek-chat.aspx.
Also a congratulations to this event’s coordinator Elizabeth.
What nonsense. There are no gays in the Greek system.  Go recruit somewhere else.  Just a bunch of pansies patiing each other on the backs.
Here we ago again with the old curmudgeon trolls. I know you’re lonely, but find something better to do than troll on a college newspaper. You’re a disgrace to all alumni.

Better late than never, I guess.Such was my initial reaction to USC coach Lane Kiffin’s apology of sorts for the disastrous 2012 football season. In a two-hour interview with ESPN’s Gene Wojciechowski, Kiffin accepted blame for all that went wrong last season, admitting that he is a “coaching work in progress” and that he needs to “grow up.”
For once, I don’t think many USC fans will disagree with him.
First, I’ll give the man his credit: I agree with most of what he said. The odds were stacked against the 2012 Trojans. With so much pressure to be perfect, anything less than an undefeated season would have disappointed many, so it was unlikely that the third-year coach would please everybody.
But he didn’t do himself any favors along the way.
At this point, it would be quite redundant to hash through all of Kiffin’s missteps last season, which went far beyond the win-loss figures. The jersey switching, the football deflating and the beatwriter banning have all been well-documented.
Kiffin’s off-the-field transgressions have proved to be distractions and, if we are to believe his words, distractions were something that his players already had had enough of.
“When you have all the hype that this team had around it coming into this season — [the players said], ‘See you in the Orange Bowl [site of the Discover BCS national championship],” Kiffin said in the interview of his team’s mindset coming into the season. “That’s where their minds were, regardless of what we [coaches] said.”
This is where many have taken issue with Kiffin. Over the course of his relatively short career, he has been called many things: petulant, arrogant and dishonest, to name a few. His reputation precedes him wherever he goes to the point that I’m not sure many people outside of his defenders at USC have any nice things to say about him.
But he has also been called something else: a good football coach. A current USC football player said just as much recently, while also criticizing Kiffin for the lack of control he had over the USC locker room. That lack of control was evidenced by the reported incident involving several players. It has been characterized as a “disagreement” by some and a “full-on brawl” by others following the loss to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl.
Regardless, few have questioned Kiffin’s knowledge of the Xs and Os. He has excelled in that regard, as well as in recruiting. But it is in the area of managing and leading people, namely kids in their late teens and early 20s, that Kiffin appears to have failed. One needs to look no further than his comments about his own players making plans for Miami before the season even began.
For Kiffin’s sake, and for USC’s, he must improve in this facet of coaching. Whether or not he can remains to be seen. But admitting there is a problem is the first step in combating it, and Kiffin did that this week — a reassuring development. But his other comments were equally troubling.
With respect to the infamous jersey-switching incident that occurred against Colorado, Kiffin claims that the tactic was “100 percent legal,” according to NCAA rules. But, according to Wojciechowski, the NCAA Football Rules and Interpretations manual states, “The following are unethical practices: Changing numbers during the game to deceive the opponent.”
Kiffin claims there was “no intent to deceive.” If that is the case, then what was the intent? To see how redshirt freshman quarterback Cody Kessler looked wearing jersey No. 35?
Kiffin’s refusal to budge on this topic speaks to his stubbornness, a trait that has its positives and negatives in the college football world. With national signing day right around the corner, it will most certainly be an asset in persuading high school players to come to USC following last season’s poor showing. Even with scholarship reductions, Kiffin’s 2013 class has already been lauded as one of the nation’s best, and a strong finish will earn him some goodwill among his detractors.
But past incidents like the jersey switch will always find their way into the conversation, and as a result, forming an opinion on Lane Kiffin will never be as simple as black and white.
In the results-based institution that is college football, I believe Kiffin can succeed. He proved it two seasons ago, and I believe he can do it again. You may never consider yourself a “Lane Kiffin fan” because of his many offenses, but he doesn’t need to win a popularity contest to be the right man for the job of USC’s head coach. He needs better results on the field, not to convince people to like him.
But by winning more games next year, he might just be able to do both.

Coming off a victory against Cal Poly Pomona and UC Irvine on Tuesday, the USC men’s tennis team will play host to No. 17 University of Texas on Friday at Marks Stadium. The Trojans have gotten off to a strong start, winning all four of their matches this season in convincing fashion without the assistance of star junior Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 10 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association in singles.
Welcome back · After missing the team’s last four matches, junior Ray Sarmiento is expected to return to action as USC’s top-ranked player. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
 
In the absence of Sarmiento, junior Emilio Gomez has handled No. 1 position duties confidently. Gomez earned Pac-12 player of the week honors for his play in the ITA Kick-Off Weekend and has yet to drop a set in singles play this season.
The Texas Longhorns’ men’s tennis team is coming off a tough loss to No. 9 Kentucky at ITA Kick-Off Weekend. In that matchup, Texas’ top ranked player sophomore Soren Hess-Olesen (No. 31) suffered an upset to Kentucky’s Anthony Rossi (No. 94). Look for the Longhorns to come out to Marks Stadium hungry and prepared to face the Trojans, whom have yet to face of a highly ranked opponents.
This isn’t to say the Trojans haven’t faced any difficulties: USC coach Peter Smith scheduled Tuesday’s doubleheader two days after the ITA Kick-Off final and three days before their matchup against Texas, giving his players little time to catch their breath.
“All I’m trying to do is to create a little adversity for these guys, just to toughen them up,” Smith said, adding that he also sought to “create [adversity] when we don’t have it.”
Even self-imposed challenges seemed ineffective in stopping the Trojans, who cruised to a 6-1 vanquishing of UC Irvine in the second leg of the doubleheader.
Smith emphasized the necessity of training and conditioning in preparing for Texas, whom he characterized as “definitely a level higher” than the Trojans’ previous opposition.
“I know what kind of great program [Texas men’s tennis coach Michael Center] runs, how well his players compete,” Smith said. “We have to step up.”
The Longhorns had won four straight matches, including finals at the Key Biscayne Invitational, before their loss to Kentucky. They come to Marks Stadium with three ITA-ranked players on their roster, including freshman standout Nick Naumann (No. 98), senior Daniel Whitehead (No. 43) and Hess-Olesen.
Friday will also see the ITA season debut of Sarmiento, who, after sitting out the first four ITA matches with an abdominal injury, will see his first action against Hess-Olesen and the visiting Longhorns. In other injury news, sophomore Yannick Hanfmann is questionable for Friday’s matchup after suffering a minor setback in his doubles matchup Tuesday. Hanfmann has been beleaguered by tendinitis in his knee and elbow since the Sherwood Collegiate Cup, and on Tuesday also suffered a Grade I ankle sprain. Despite these ailments, Smith is hopeful that Hanfmann will be available and ready to play Friday.
For all the talk of adversity in the locker room, the Trojans are sure to face a true challenge against Texas on Friday. Doubles play begins at 3 p.m. at Marks Stadium, with singles play beginning immediately thereafter.
its gonna be a battle royal. Coach P. Smith will have our team ready,  Please be well Yannick, we nEED U.
Great to see ray-Ray back in action Friday v. Longhorns.   Lets cheer loud and HOOK da Horns!!!

The ball finally bounced the Trojans’ way. After USC blew the entirety of its 15-point lead in the second half, junior forward Ari Stewart made two clutch free throws with 11.4 seconds left to put the Trojans up 74-71 in overtime. Following a missed 3-pointer by UCLA’s swingman Shabazz Muhammad, a free throw from senior point guard Jio Fontan sealed the stunning 75-71 upset in Westwood.

After losing an overtime heartbreaker against Arizona State on Thursday, the Trojans barely made it into overtime after UCLA’s Larry Drew II missed a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of regulation buzzer to send the game into the extra period tied at 65. The Trojans went back and forth with the Bruins in the extra period before sophomore guard Byron Wesley hit an arcing bank shot in the lane to put USC up 72-71 with 1:36 left.
Muhammad missed a 3-pointer on the next possession, and USC corralled the rebound with 19 seconds left. Senior forward Eric Wise missed a running shot in the lane, but got his own rebound, dished the ball out to Stewart, who was fouled and sent to the line. The Bruins could not muster another point.
“When we needed a basket, we got it,” USC coach Bob Cantu said. “When we needed to get the ball in-bounds, we did. They [USC’s players] hung in there and they made it when it counted.”
The Trojans improve to 9-13 on the year, with a 4-5 record in Pac-12 play. Fontan and senior forward Aaron Fuller led the Trojans with a season-high 15 points, with Fuller shooting 6-of-7 from the field while coming of the bench. Wise had 12 points and 11 rebounds for USC, while junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell and Wesley each finished in double digits with 10 points.
USC led the entire second half, but UCLA slowly chipped away at the lead after USC took a 52-37 lead with 13:25 left. The Bruins got USC’s top players into foul trouble in the second half, as senior point guard Jio Fontan and Wise played with four fouls down the stretch. UCLA outscored USC 9-2 in the final 4:26, as Muhammad scored 15 points in the second half after shooting just 1-for-5 with 5 points in the first half. Despite the foul trouble, Fontan finished with one of his best games of the season by notching 6 assists and maintaining the Trojans’ focus in the extra five minutes.
“He didn’t allow himself to get rattled as a point guard and as a leader,” Cantu said about his floor general. “Jio Fontan is a very good player, and he showed it in a big time environment tonight.”
Though both were questionable to play because of various ailments, Muhammad (flu) scored 22 points to lead all scorers while forward Travis Wear (concussion) was the Bruins’ other main offensive threat with 16 points on 5-of-9 shooting. USC outshot UCLA 47.7 percent to 38.2 percent, with the Bruins shooting just 33.3 percent in the opening half.
The Trojans struck first with a 3 from Terrell to take an early 5-1 lead. But UCLA’s length and aggressiveness turned into four easy transition points as the Bruins went on an 8-0 run to take a 9-5 lead. USC was able to contest almost every Bruin shot attempt on defense and, thanks to some deft passing, found itself tied again at 13 with 11:56 left in the half.
The Trojans worked the Bruins down low to find easy baskets for Fuller and Wise and, after a 17-4 run, found themselves up 32-25 with 4:23 remaining in the first half. Following a reverse bank shot by senior center James Blasczyk, the stunned crowd at Pauley saw their team down double-digits, as USC took a 38-27 lead with 2:07 left in the first half. The Bruins were able to cut the deficit to 38-30 at halftime, but the Trojans ended the half on a 23-9 scoring run. USC shot 50 percent in the first half while holding the Bruins to just 33.3 percent on 11-of-33 shooting. After not playing more than 16 minutes in a game under Cantu, Fuller exceeded his season high in the first half alone, throwing down 13 points on 5-5 shooting to go along with some key rebounds down the stretch.
“You try to leave it all on the court,” Fuller said. “I made (rebounding) my top priority to be on the glass offensive and defensively, and I thought it all jelled tonight.”
Junior forward Dewayne Dedmon opened the second half with an alley-oop from Wise, and, two minutes later, a thunderous Terrell slam reduced the noise in Pauley to crickets as USC took a 44-31 lead. The Trojans extended the lead to 15 at 52-37 on a Fontan jumper a few minutes later before the Bruins began chipping away at the lead.
The Trojans have endured tough losses down the stretch in the past two weeks against Arizona State and Oregon but plan to grow through adversity.
“Playing the top four teams, we’ve realized that we can play along with them,” Fontan said. “Despite the loss we had at Arizona, the other ones we were in the game so we just have to do a better job of closing out games and learning from this so we can grow.”
We beat them at their own sport, like they did to us in football. Payback for the football game!
Its so great to see our Men of Troy win the 1st match in New Pauley, the “Shrine where Troy SHINES!!!”
Believe in these men. This team can compete, and if we continue to improve, good things can happen in the Pac 12 Tourney in Vegas.  See y’all in Galen for the REMATCH.  NIce reverse bank James…..way to lead Jio,
nive job off da bench…Fuller…amazing stuff!    Wise playin smart,  Terrell making shots count,  love the energy and bounce back from adversity.  FIGHT ON TROJANS!!!!

The Viterbi School of Engineering professor will receive the honor for his work in shift register sequences at a White House ceremony on Friday.
Golomb is one of 12 scientists and engineers receiving the award this year. Since the inception of this award in 1959, 400 people have received this accolade. Golomb’s work has helped to further both the fields of mathematics and communication.
Golomb began his academic career at Johns Hopkins University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree before he turned 19. He went on to complete his doctorate and earned his master’s degree in mathematics at Harvard.
Golomb began working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab at Caltech, where he worked with and mentored Andrew Viterbi, the namesake of the Viterbi School and previous winner of the National Medal of Science.
Golomb has previously been awarded the USC Presidential Medallion, the National Security Agency Director’s medal, the Hamming Medal and the IEEE Shannon Award of the Information Theory Society.
Shift register sequences are series of zeroes and ones that are used in everything from cell phone systems to space communications. In addition to this invention, Golomb is also known for inventing Cheskers — a variant of Checkers — and pentominoes, the inspiration for the popular game Tetris. The Golomb Ruler, commonly used in astronomy, is named for him.

Though USC has been inching toward it for nearly a decade, this is the first year that fewer than half of the applicants to the undergraduate freshman class are from California, according to the Office of Admissions.
“In this year’s freshman applicant pool [of prospective students], the students who will be enrolling at USC this coming fall, only 49.5 percent of our applications were from students in California,” wrote Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold in an email to the Daily Trojan. “This is the first time that our applicant pool has ever been less than 50 percent Californian.”
Though the university is still accepting and rejecting applicants, the steady shift in applicant demographics has been reflected in the matriculating classes of past years. The freshman class of Fall 2011 was the first class to hit the 50 percent benchmark for accepted students, as 49 percent of the now-sophomores stayed within the state.
“Even though these percentage shifts might seem small, remember that one percentage point represents 27 to 30 students, depending on the size of each year’s entering cohort,” Brunold said.
Brunold attributes these trends to USC’s “substantial and aggressive” recruiting. Last fall, representatives from USC admissions visited between 2,100 and 2,200 high schools within the 48 contiguous states and Washington D.C., as well as 12 countries outside the United States Today, USC has 20 admission recruiters assigned to the Midwest and the East Coast, up from six recruiters in the area 10 years ago.
“We are looking far and wide for the students who’ll fit best at USC,” Brunold said.
USC also started recruiting in Brazil this year, after adding India to its recruitment calendar last year. Though the effects of this addition won’t be apparent until fall of next year, the university’s international recruitment helped to ensure that 12 percent of the fall 2012 freshman class came from outside the country.
“USC has made major strides in national and international reputation over the last decade and has taken steps to capitalize on that recognition through things like the Common Application,” said  Jerry Lucido, a research professor at the Rossier School of Education and an expert on college admissions. “USC has been aggressive in establishing offices in other countries.”
But other American universities are not seeing similar results. Despite higher numbers of students enrolling in college and more aggressive recruiting on the part of universities everywhere, 53 percent of students still choose to attend college within 100 miles of home — a figure that has stayed relatively constant over the past 40 years, according to the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA.
The steady figure of university students at home contradicts the trend at USC, with 64 percent of this year’s undergraduate freshmen coming from outside Southern California, compared to 60 percent a decade ago.
Lucido said the recent state of the economy kept some students closer to home.
“Most college students in the U.S., at least 80 percent, attend public colleges and universities, including community colleges and regional public universities,” Lucido wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “This is largely due to lower cost and convenience, and these are particularly important options for low and middle income students.”
Though students are coming from more parts of the country than before, Lucido believes that, despite these numbers, Californians will still look to attend USC.
“I think this suggests a widening applicant pool,” Lucido said. “Not a lessening of interest from within California.”
Students most frequently consider academic program, location, cost, institutional size and academic reputation when they pick a college. Lucido pointed to USC’s strong reputation, large financial aid budget, loyal alumni, residential nature and the draw of Los Angeles as primary factors in USC’s ability to attract students from far away.
Students said prestige and financial aid contribute largely to the growing number of out-of-state students. Rica Maestas, a freshman majoring in cognitive science from New Mexico, said USC represented the best value for her.
“USC was in my top considerations of schools, and out of those top considerations they gave me the most financial aid,” Maestas said.
Other students said USC offered what colleges closer to them could not.
“I was interested in film and I looked up the best film schools,” said Jorge Molina, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television. “USC came up, so it was a no-brainer.”
Overall, many students view the increase of students from different geographic regions as an enhancement for the school.
“It just shows how diverse ’SC is and how they recruit students and how far-reaching, a degree from USC can be,” said Michael Whalen, a graduate student from California in the master’s health administration program. “It just shows that the alumni in other states and other countries are promoting USC and showing people that USC is a great school.”

Friday officially marks the beginning of February, which means America is about to get its annual replay of black history.
Over the course of the next month, millions of Americans will catch snippets of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech just before turning the radio dial or briefly consider reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X before tuning in to an episode of The Bachelor. With February delivering the hard-and-fast version of black history, it’s easy to believe that years of experience have provided you with all of the information you’ve ever needed to know. Generic ideas of the “value of diversity” or the “importance of equality” can easily force Americans to fall into the dull pattern of skimming the surface of the civil rights movement or checking out the latest in “black entertainment” — at any rate, ticket sales for Django Unchained should soar.
But it’s not that February lacks sufficient subject matter. Cramming black history into the short span of 28 days is almost equivalent to trying to learn the history of the entire world over the course of one semester (think about how nearly impossible it was to master A.P. World before the May exam). Labeling one period of the year “Black History Month” simply doesn’t allow for valuable recognition of African-American achievements — especially when it comes to literature.
Though some titles, such as Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man or Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, have managed to land a spot on the standard American high school reading list, they’ve rarely managed to escape their rigid identity of “African-American literature.” When thinking of American literature, for example, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner are usually the first names to come to mind. These talented authors, however, get the free pass of writing without the need for a hyphen: You wouldn’t classify The Great Gatsby, for example, as “White-American literature.”
But somehow there’s a different mindset when it comes to works by minority writers. Though the term “African-American literature” is intended to reference the ethnic background of the author or even to describe a so-called “black experience,” it often suggests that such works are intended only for African-American readers, which is hardly the case.
In fact, black writers might choose to tackle concepts of slavery, segregation and even just life within dominant European American culture, but these remain irremovable aspects of American history, ones that remain culturally relevant for all Americans regardless of their ethnic background.
Early slave narratives, such as Frederick Douglass’ Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave or Harriet Jacob’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, created a brand new American literary genre. As they revealed the horrors of slavery and disputed claims that African-Americans were naturally inferior, 19th-century black authors employed innovative rhetorical strategies that supplemented burgeoning truth-telling and autobiographical methods of writing that stretched beyond ethnic boundaries.
Still, even without direct references to historical events, minority writers handle topics such as falling in love, the ambiguity of death and even what it means to be human — all of which remain relevant to any ethnic group.
Toni Morrison’s Jazz, for example, does explore the impact of slavery on contemporary blacksbut also the multifaceted nature of love.
“Don’t ever think I fell for you, or fell over you,” says Joe, the novel’s middle-aged protagonist who murders his teenage lover, Dorcas. “I didn’t fall in love, I rose in it.”
As the unlikely pair tries to find consolation in the others existence, Morrison chronicles the complexities of human emotion, cementing her own take on the love story into 20th-century American literature.
But black writers are hardly the only ones to re-shape the American literary canon. Other minority writers continue to release works that add other dimensions to American experiences, ultimately creating a more accurate depiction of life in the United States.
Junot Díaz’s This Is How You Lose Her, which was released last September, follows the romantic escapades of Junior, a Dominican immigrant reflecting on his attitudes toward women through adolescence and adulthood. Throughout the novel, Díaz’s character remains in a sort of liminal state. Not only does he fluctuate between finding love and blowing relationships with his continual infidelity, he also travels back and forth between the United States and the Domincan Republic, highlighting the dualistic nature of Latino culture in America.
Likewise, Jhumpa Lahiri, whose second novel, The Lowland, is set for release this September, seamlessly intertwines Indian and American culture. With her short story collections Interpreter of Maladies and Unaccustomed Earth, Lahiri creates characters who struggle with European definitions of “sexy,” cook traditional lamb dishes in their Boston homes and fall in love with their ethnically different husbands and raise interracial children. And considering the works of other authors such as Chinese-American author Amy Tan or Native American writer Sherman Alexie, it’s indisputable that American literature is multifaceted.
Yes, it’s true that some of these authors might make references to the particularities of minority life, but these shouldn’t be viewed as distancing or exclusive. Instead, they should be considered universal explorations of humanity and, ultimately, celebrations of what it means to be American. Hyphen excluded.

Hip-hop. Jazz. Soul. Experimental.
You can’t put Rippy Austin in a box. And he likes it that way.
Current USC senior Rippy Austin (or Garret Rountree as you may know him) dropped his debut genre-bending EP Patiently Waiting in December. Entirely written, produced, performed and even packaged by Austin, the album is a labor of love. “I had a hand in everything I did, from the production to the writing and composing, to the artwork. I had to do my own branding and packaging and market my stuff.” Says Austin.

At first glance, with the triple hyphenate of rapper/singer/producer, it is easy to classify Austin amongst the likes of Drake, B.o.B. and similar top-40 pop/rap fare. However, Austin’s debut combines traditional hip-hop tropes with experimental synth sounds and smooth jazz guitars, making it quite unlike any material out there. The musician gushes, “I love not being able to be confined—being able to do my own thing.” And confined he is not.
When asked to describe the diverse E.P. accurately, Austin replied “It’s very eclectic. It’s very melodic. There’s a lot of music in it, a lot of free rhythm in it and you just have to be as open minded as possible and just listen to it. It stands for me doing what I love.” Austin credits his nomadic childhood with nurturing his innovative style. He reflects, “My style is different, so I can’t really say one (experience) that defines it. But because I’ve been able to live and see so many places, I kind of draw from everywhere.”
The eclectic EP is undeniably original, which can either entice or isolate the audience, depending on the listener. Those craving a break from the major-chord, pop-infused rap records on the charts will relish Austin’s offbeat, unique sound. However, Austin’s experimentalism often means that there is no distinct chorus or hook on songs. A prime example of this free form style is on the song “L.O.V.E.”, one of seven tracks on Patiently Waiting, which simply features Austin freestyling various phrases over an ambient beat without any distinctive structure or melody.
However, Rippy, who started producing as a meek 7th grader inspired by the likes of Snoop Doog, is capable of combining his ear for the experimental and his talent for classic hip-hop production. When he does so—like on tracks such as One Day and, to a lesser extent, Ms. Jackson—he shines. Patiently Waiting’s finest moments occur when Austin allows strong melody to be center, rather than ambient experimental sounds.
It is this strong recipe that easily makes the song “One Day” the highlight of the album. This standout track featuring B9 and Versis seamlessly combines Austin’s offbeat ear for ambience and minimalism with traditional hip-hop and top-40 sweetness, making it the most palatable and enjoyable for the public at large. True to Austin’s sound, the hook doesn’t slap you in the face. However, that is the style that he tends towards. You won’t hear any roaring choruses on Patiently Waiting. However, you will hear jazz guitars, neo-soul and experimental synths, which is not something often said of a hip-hop record.  This is what sets Austin apart from your typical aspiring rapper/singer/Drake rip-off; his ear tends towards unusual sounds and experimentation.
The EP also features a cover of Outkasts’ popular 2003 release “Ms. Jackson”, which Austin strips down and simplifies. The ethereal track combined with Austin’s smooth vocals on the chorus and clean flow on the verses makes for a very interesting and oddly relaxing take on the Outkast classic.
According to Austin, the cover was actually a happy accident. During the writing process, he was writing over a beat he had earlier produced and he had the Ms. Jackson melody in his head. He reveals, “I thought it would be corny if I used the same lyrics, so I tried to substitute and do something else with it, but at the end of the day, it wasn’t working. So I thought, why not just use Ms. Jackson? So I just went and wrote a verse to match it.”
Ms. Jackson and One Day are the standout tracks on the sometimes-confused, always-unique debut effort by Mr. Austin. However, with some more time to hone his exceptional sound, Austin will surely find his place in the music world.
And Austin assures us, there is much more to come. “I specifically made Patiently Waiting to be somewhat of a teaser. It’s just to draw you in, get a feel for what I do. There will definitely be a follow up EP soon.”
Patiently Waiting is available for purchase on Austin’s bandcamp at rippyaustin.bandcamp.com.

Multicultural · The hardcore punk band is back after a break where the band explored mariachi music under the alter ego Mariachi El Bronx. – Courtesy of Lisa Johnson
Few know more about being punk rock stars than The Bronx. This Los Angeles-based band was founded in 2002 by guitarist Joby Ford and has since made its mark in the punk-rock world.
Today, the band features five members: lead singer Matt Caughthran, guitarists Joby Ford and Ken Horne, bassist Brad Magers and drummer Jorma Vik. These five rockers have been playing together since 2007, and after a five-year hiatus, the band is ready to release its fourth self-titled album, The Bronx (IV), on Feb. 5.
During these past five years, the band has spent their time in the music industry recording mariachi-style music through their alter-ego band, Mariachi El Bronx.
This new album includes 12 new tracks, including their new single, “Ribcage.”
When asked about the band’s reason for choosing to name each of their albums after the band, Vik jokingly replied, “We’re just kind of lazy.”
“We thought it would be cool for the artwork to differentiate the records, and honestly, we would rather be playing our music than argue about an album title,” he said.
Musically, the album is quite different from the others the band has released, both in the writing process and sound of the tracks.
Unlike its previous times recording, where the writing process was very scattered, The Bronx found an efficient way of creating more sophisticated rock songs.
Prior to this album, the band had trouble creating songs where each musical part flowed together. However, The Bronx has now established a method by which they systematically put their songs together.
Ford would begin the creative process by coming up with a riff and giving each song a basic structure. Then, Caughthran would add some melody ideas to the mix. Next, Vik would lay down a basic drum beat to give the song a groove. And each piece would fit together to create another Bronx hit.
“I think this style of recording has worked a lot better for us, because we all kind of know what’s happening before we put all the pieces together,” Vik said.
Many who have listened to this new album have described the band as “all grown up.” Their sound and style has matured beyond the simple aggression the band began with in 2002.
“We didn’t go into this record thinking, ‘Let’s make a more mature, accessible record,’” Vik said. “It just kind of happened because we are maturing as songwriters and individuals.”
The band has chosen to release this album through White Drugs/ATO Records, a label that gives them more freedom and creative license than their previous label, the world-famous Island Def Jam.
“Working with [Island Def Jam] was a really cool experience, and we definitely don’t take it for granted,” Vik said. “But we’re definitely better off on our own, without all the red tape. We can make music the way we want.”
 
It has been five years since the band’s last album release,  but The Bronx has certainly been keeping busy with its alter-ego band, Mariachi El Bronx.
The punk rockers found themselves playing mariachi-style music in response to a request to perform one of their songs acoustically during a television appearance.
Rather than turning down the volume, they decided to completely play one of their slower tunes, “Dirty Leaves,” with traditional mariachi instruments.
This unique performance sparked the group’s interest in mariachi music, leading to the creation of a whole new band.
Mariachi El Bronx has released two albums, both of which are self-titled, and the band stated that there are certainly more albums to come.
The Bronx’s alter ego has both influenced the punk band’s playing style and given the group opportunities to be involved in two different musical niches.
Mariachi El Bronx has been featured on David Letterman and Jay Leno’s late-night shows, and has played gigs as far-reaching as the London Symphony Orchestra.
While Mariachi El Bronx takes a break, The Bronx continues its tour through the United States and Great Britain.
“Getting to travel the world with your best friends and partying every night is the coolest thing in the world,” Vik said.

From the bustling crowds of people carrying large shopping bags to the countless brand-name stores lining the street, South Beverly Drive offers all the glamour of Beverly Hills and, just recently, a little something you can’t find anywhere else on the West Coast.

It might be easy to walk down the busy boulevard without noticing the new jewelry store on the block — or at least it would be, were it not for the eye-catching display in the front window of Verameat.
Through the window, it is immediately apparent that Verameat is not your mother’s jewelry shop. From the sparkling pieces of jewelry that adorn disembodied white hands hanging from the ceiling to the bright red floor and stark white walls, Verameat pushes the boundaries of design.
Inside, the minimalist, eccentric decor combined with the sounds of indie bands and old favorites — a mix of Foster the People and Beach House interspersed with The Velvet Underground and Bob Dylan — gives the store a laid-back, effortlessly cool vibe. Even the displays in the store are artistically edgy and animalistic. A ring can be found in the open mouth of an alligator, a necklace hanging from the antlers of a deer.
If Verameat sounds familiar, it is because the chain, which was launched four years ago, has several stores on the East Coast. This is the chain’s first West Coast location, though.
Each piece in the store is handcrafted from ecologically sound, recycled silver and pure 14-karat gold. The quality of the jewelry is undeniable, but it is the designs that make the pieces unforgettable.
From a dinosaur dangling at the end of a necklace to skeleton hands forming bracelet, each piece of jewelry is disarmingly cute and unexpected.
The individual flair of the jewelry personifies the founder of Verameat, Vera Balyura. The Ukrainian-born designer spent her lifetime traveling the world, accruing interesting stories and developing the quirky spirit that shines through in her jewelry.
When asked to describe Balyura’s style in one word, Katherine To, an employee at Verameat Beverly Hills chose “phantasmagorical.”
Balyura’s influences come from her mother’s jewelry collection, her grandfather’s miniature woodcarvings and her unconventional experiences growing up. At 14 years old, Balyura signed onto an elite modeling agency in Paris and moved out on her own. In the years that followed she lived in a number of European countries and finally ended up in New York.
While in New York, she dallied in various artistic endeavors before discovering her talent for jewelry design. In this spirit, Balyura continues to expand her brand and to explore the world of jewelry with no limitations to where she can go with her unique, edgy style.
To said Balyura’s work is unique because, though the pieces are autobiographical, they are also relevant to shoppers coming into Verameat.
“Each piece is a unique story in Vera’s life and has the same ability to transform the wearer’s life,” To said.
An unorthodox “Dino Eating Fried Chicken” ring was one of the many pieces that To said illustrated Balyura’s quirky side.
“I have a fascination with items that are either too small or too large and Vera’s collection plays on that idea,” To said. “The jewelry brings out my child-like curiosity.”
When asked what her favorite Verameat piece of jewlery was, To chose the Mystery Hug ring, which was given to her when she started at working at the store.
“[The ring] marked the culmination of a new business, new friends and new changes in my life.” To said. “It’s like my finger is getting hugged every time I wear it.”
To, who was wearing several pieces from the Verameat collection, said she also particularly loves the minute details that go into each piece as well as the sensation that she’s wearing art.
The fun individuality of Balyura’s pieces has caught the attention of many prominent fashion figures, as well as celebrities such as Khloe Kardashian and Zach Galifianakis. The Kardashian sister chose the “Bad Ass Knuckle Duster For Girls,” a surprisingly delicate ring with a dangerous flair, while Galifianakis has been seen wearing the Dino ring, which has earned its own share of laughs.
Each month, Verameat hosts a store party at their location in Beverly Hills. At this time, Verameat fans can take advantage of discounts on the jewelry and mingle with others who like to indulge their quirky side. With the Verameat jewelry, known for its tendency to function as an icebreaker and hanging off every corner of the small, chic store, there’s likely to be some great conversations to be had — and maybe even some celebrity sightings. The next party will take place on Feb. 12 from 5-8 p.m.
With a queue of devoted fans and wealthy celebrity customers, one might expect a large price tag attached to Verameat’s gold and silver pieces. The prices are surprisingly affordable though. Of course, some of the items, such as the “Dino Love Bone” necklace, costing $320, might be a one-time splurge. Still, many of the pieces, such as the “Screw” ring, at only $20, are at a much more accessible price point.
Whether making an investment or an impulse buy, Verameat jewelry, with its heirloom-esque style and uniqueness, is not a fashion statement that will go out of style anytime soon.

The United States needs to develop a diplomatic response to North Korea’s threat of nuclear warfare.
Lily Tiao | Daily Trojan
In 2006, the North Korean government attempted a nuclear test and in 2009, engaged in a second test that showed off improvements. What is disconcerting to many about a third test is whether North Korea will display greater missile capability than it did in the past. Officials have concluded that it is difficult to know if there will be an impending detonation.
The provocative rhetoric, however, that North Korea has been using on this issue is not something new. Charles Armstrong, director of the Center for Korean Studies at Columbia University, told NPR that North Korea’s response was “fairly predictable. It has to be kept in mind that North Korea has been doing this for a long time. And even the words ‘act of war’ were used first in 1994 when the Clinton administration threatened to take sanctions questions to the U.N. over its nuclear program.”
The current measures taken against North Korea have been to closely monitor the country and increase sanctions on companies, organizations and individuals involved in the nuclear and missile programs in the country. The sanctions also include increased measures to inspect cargo that comes in and out of North Korea. “We believe that today’s resolution is a firm, united, appropriate response to North Korea’s reckless act,” U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said in a statement, “and that strict enforcement of sanctions is essential to address the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.”
Currently, it would be detrimental to attack or provoke North Korea because it would only stoke the fire. Nuclear testing is a slow, tedious process, and officials cannot say for certain if North Korea has the capability at present to back up what they are publicly stating. Armstrong has also noted that the real purpose of their grandiose statements is to serve as a distraction and that “if they can convince Americans that they can reach American soil with their nuclear missiles, then that will guarantee that the U.S. will never attack them for any reason.”
If North Korea carries the sort of weapons that they claim to, why have they yet to attack Seoul, the capital of one of the top-10 economies on Earth and a metropolis located in their own backyard? Why have they danced around the option of attacking the United States for decades? They can attempt to frighten Americans, but, fortunately, a roar has no effect if it comes from a mouse instead of a lion.
If the international community cooperates with sanctions, tightens restrictions and continues to oversee this country, perhaps some agreements and negotiations can be made.
Hopefully, by addressing North Korea’s more pertinent flaws, such as a crumbling economy, the country will not have to resort to military means in order to justify its regime.

Our government should not wait for a deadly attack but instead show our impressive military prowess.
The question boils down to one simple idea: If Pyongyang is nothing to be worried about, then why would the United Nations place sanctions on the city’s nuclear weapons plan to begin with?
Before one dismisses Kim Jong-un’s speech, it is imperative to understand just who the United States is dealing with. This is a man who was thrust into power after the death of his father, a man who ruled for decades. This is a man who executed 14 senior officials for apparently threatening his regime by criticizing his youthfulness and inexperience as well as apparently engaging in unsavory behavior such as intoxication and sexual misbehavior.
This is a young man looking to make a point, and one who will most likely use any means necessary to assert his power. After all, as North Korea’s economy sinks deeper into oblivion, the government must find ways to maintain power and supremacy in the communist state.
Most will argue that Kim Jong-il was not a great leader, but he was at least a man that the United States government pretty much knew from head to toe. He controlled his country with an iron fist and was rather unkind to the rest of the world, but our country did not fear the North Korean regime as we might do now.
As the saying goes, “it’s better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know” — and we do not know who Kim Jong-un is. We do not know what he has in store for us. Simply waiting around for North Korea to take physical action is possible but precarious. Gun law reform is finally being seriously talked about in Congress, but it took a few massacres and the deaths of 20 school children for us to get to that point. Taking action a second after a nuclear attack is a second too late.
The U.N. has made its sanctions, but all that means is that a few rules are now written down and North Korea must promise not to break them. In light of that, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta needs to work with the South Korean government in order to craft a more aggressive plan and confront North Korea’s threats head on.
The U.S. government is seen as a beacon of diplomacy, but it is time that we show North Korea that we do not speak with empty words, and we will not be bullied into submission.
Military provocation should always be considered a last resort, but it is quite obvious that the North Korean regime desires to back the United States into a corner. It is time that we take action before it is too late.

Any attempt by the US to attack North Korea will be impeded by North Korea’s threat to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire” if Kim Jong-un’s regime is ever threatened. Rather than take military action, the US should simply fund pro-democracy groups in South Korea who insist that North Korea must clean up its abysmal human rights record before the US considers rapproachment with the Hermit Kingdom. Barack Obama could simply ask a South Korean activist to sneak into North Korea by sailing to the west coast on a boat so that the activist can bring down statues of Kim il-sung and Kim Jong-il with an axe and a rope (just as Saddam Hussein’s statue was brought down during the 2003 US invasion of Iraq) — that way North Korea’s attention is distracted from its nuclear weapons program. We could see Christian escapees from North Korea sneak into North Korea and shout to Kim Jong-un, “Nuclear warfare is immoral. It does nothing but destroy all of humanity!”.
