After being a band for 11 years, the five-piece metal band, Atreyu, is officially on hiatus for an undetermined span of time.
Singer Alex Varkatzas tweeted on the band’s Twitter on January 13, “We aren’t breaking up but we aren’t writing, recording or touring for a while. Simply taking a break to recharge and focus on different parts of our lives.”

Using Twitter may not have been the fastest way to communicate the news, seeing that due to the 140 character limit, it took four tweets to state the whole message. Nonetheless, the deed was done.
First breaking into the metal scene of Orange County in 1998, Atreyu has come a long way. First working with underground labels, they have recorded five studio albums, including Congregation of the Damned, released in 2009.
Varkatzas, however, also encouraged fans to take a look into each member’s side projects currently in the works.
If the band sticks to its word about not breaking up, maybe in the next couple of years, the 11 simple characters “We’re back!” will be tweeted on their official page.

With National Signing Day fast approaching, USC picked up another commitment Sunday for their impressive 2011 class from running back Amir Carlisle (Sunnyval, Calif.).
“Amir is going to USC,” his father Duane said in a text message to Scout West Recruiting Analyst Brandon Huffman, according to Scout.com.
The four-star running back prospect, according to Rivals.com, had previously been committed to Stanford, but switched to USC after making an unofficial visit to campus this weekend. Not only did USC take away a commit from a Pac-10 rival, but it also added its only running back for the 2011 class. Ranked by Scout.com as the 16th best player at his position, Carlisle measures 5’11.5” and weighs 190 pounds.
Recruiting analyst Brandon Huffman has compared him to former California standout Jahvid Best, who was known for his speed and breakaway ability. Carlisle runs a 4.43 40-yard dash and can catch passes well coming out of the backfield, which will make him a two-dimensional threat for the Trojans. He does not, however, have the kind of power and strength to pound the ball up the middle, but he is extremely dangerous in the open field and can change direction on a dime. Most importantly, Carlisle has incredible balance and can sustain contact while still staying on his feet, which could translate into big plays.
The Trojans currently have sixteen commitments for their 2011 class.
Ugh, you write for the DT, please understand the sanctions…
The limit of 15 scholarships will not take place until next year. After the Jan 22 appeal.
