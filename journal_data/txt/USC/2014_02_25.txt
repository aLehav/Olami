This Tuesday, USC Visions and Voices presented “Lost Borders: Water, Climate Change and the West,” a play and multimedia slideshow to exhibit the water scarcity problem in the Western United States.
Water woes · Melody Butiu, part of The Chisera, discusses the dangers of the drought afflicting Los Angeles in Doheny Memorial Library. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
According to the event’s page, the Western United States has long been plagued by issues due to water, which in turn negatively affect state borders, farming, economics, immigration and most recently climate change.
The play, entitled The Chisera, was written by USC playwright Paula Cizmar. Cizmar is an award-winning scriptwriter whose work has been featured in such venues as The Jungle Theatre in Minneapolis and the American Place Theatre in New York. Cizmar has written a number of plays, including, but not limited to, The Death of a Miner, Candy & Shelley Go to the Desert and Pretty Places.
The Chisera parallels the lives of two women and displays the effects of corporate greed on the environment. The event’s title, “Lost Borders,” takes its name from the work of nature writer Mary Hunter Austin, whose life work was also the inspiration for one of the main characters. Austin’s work, as well as the play, focused on the fight to keep control of water in the Owens Valley and Austin’s struggle to engage Sacramento and the Valley’s passion for the cause.
Following Cizmar’s play, USC Assistant Professor of Earth Sciences Sarah J. Feakins led a discussion on climate change and drought in the Western United States, specifically the recent drought problem that has arisen in Los Angeles.
“We have no sense at all that anything is awry in L.A.,” Feakins said. “In Northern California, ironically, much of the water is local, and so the drought is being felt much more there.”
According to Feakins, there have been no mandatory water cuts in Los Angeles thus far, but it is recommended to residents to cut water use by 20 percent if possible.
As a geologist, Feakins noted that part of her passion arises from on-site visits and seeing the effects of the drought in person. She noted that if L.A. residents were to drive a few hours outside of the city, they certainly would “take shorter showers.”
“It’s very good for us to get out [of L.A.],” Feakins said. “We live in this bubble that is isolated.”
Feakins encouraged the audience to present on-campus solutions to the drought problem. Many audience members were happy to contribute, presenting ideas such as shutting the fountains off during the day.
“Coming back to the idea of awareness, a lot of this is a PR issue more than anything,” said one engaged audience member during the discussion. He later mentioned that he took the initiative to write a letter to the office of President C. L. Max Nikias addressing the drought issue and asking that he do more on campus in a preventative effort.
“It’s not a sustainable thing that we have going here,” another audience member said. “If you drive out a few hours, it’s a wasteland.”
Nadia Fallahi, a freshman majoring in public relations, stressed the importance of being aware of environmental issues.
“Being informed about the environment is very important,” Fallahi said. “I think that more people need to be aware of the drought and what’s going on, and how it can affect all of our lives. We need to be informed about how to act accordingly.”

Reid Lidow, a senior majoring in international relations and political science, received a Gates Cambridge Scholarship this past week, which grants him a full scholarship at the University of Cambridge starting this fall.

A total of 40 scholars were chosen from 800 U.S. applicants. The scholarship program’s goal is to support leaders who are committed to “improving the lives of others,” according to Lidow.
Lidow is the second Trojan to receive this award. A Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Sciences student, Lidow is currently participating in the Teaching International Relations Program at USC and has been a volunteer teacher in the program since his freshman year.
Lidow said students are fortunate not just because of academic programs, but also because of the many opportunities to make an impact on and off campus.
“Here at USC, we are not blind to the fact that the community surrounding USC is — socioeconomically — a little bit down on its heels,” Lidow said. “We don’t live in a bubble. TIRP is a great way to make a difference in the community surrounding USC.”
Steven Lamy, professor of international relations, initially introduced this program to Lidow. Lamy remembers him as one of the students completing all of the assignments and attending all class sessions.
“When you see a student who takes his education very seriously, it’s important to work with those students and help them to develop as scholars,” Lamy said. “We are looking for students sitting in [the] first few rows that’s really interested in subject matter. These students ask great questions and are not overly concerned about grades. They are more concerned about learning and understanding.”
Lidow has been Professor Lamy’s research assistant for three years.
In 2012, Lidow went on an independent research trip to Burma to answer the question, “Why is Burma opening up to the world?” His senior thesis explored both the external and internal factors that motivated Burma’s reforms.
“Burma today is cut from the Tale of Two Cities image — it’s the best of times and the worst of times,” Lidow said. “Right now in Burma, there are people who never had it better, who are feeling the reforms and benefiting considerably. And there are some people who never had worse — some of the ethnic minorities.”
Professor Lamy emphasized the importance of participating in global action, and how having a mentor can help.
“What students need to do is find a faculty member who you can identify with; that can not only help answer questions, but also point out the opportunities,” Lamy said.
Lidow believes undergraduate research should arise naturally and not be forced.
“If you want to do an independent research [project], that requires a lot of patience,’ Lidow said. “I recommend waiting for that ‘Aha!’ moment.”
Lidow emphasized the importance of continuously asking questions when conducting academic research.
“I think the most important thing is to be curious,” Lidow said. “Those questions then usually lead to someone seeking to conduct their own research — And there is always a research channel or road you can take.”

Tuesday night’s USG senate meeting featured presentations from the Student Leadership Fund and the Women’s Student Assembly, as well as a presentation for allocation of funds to USG’s Program Board.
USG Leadership Fund Director Julie Stripe reported an increase in organizations sponsored. The Leadership Fund typically sponsors advocacy groups and leadership seminars.
“The leadership fund has added 40 percent of new organizations, which is very good — it means that we’re getting the word out and organizations feel comfortable coming to us for funding,” Stripe said.
The Women’s Student Assembly presented next, announcing its upcoming event, “Take Back the Week.” The event will focus on issues of sexual assault and how to prevent them on campus.
“[Sexual assault] is a very sensitive issue, but it’s very critical considering the recent establishment of the White House task force,” said WSA Executive   Co-Director Carol Ciricao.
The White House was recently appointed by President Barack Obama to explore strategies for preventing sexual assault on college campuses.
Take Back the Week takes place next week on campus. WSA said that the event is to open all USC students.
USG Treasurer Kameron VanWoerkom ended the senate meeting with a presentation of the 2014 budget allocations for USG’s Program Board. The Program Board is an umbrella organization that organizes USG-sponsored groups and events at USC, most notably concerts such as Conquest and Springfest.
Though funding for spring 2014 is comparable to previous semesters, VanWoerkom believes the program funding charged alongside student tuition must eventually be raised to match inflation and rising tuition costs.
“We’re really lagging behind in programming fees,” VanWoerkom said. “I had someone email me the other day and say their funding was ‘inadequate.’ That really hurt.”
The programming fee, still $52 per student, has not changed since 2010. VanWoerkom believes that even a small increase could greatly increase the efficacy of Program Board funds.
“I don’t want to set an expectation, but if it increased by $3, we could keep all of the program boards funded and give the concerts a big headliner,” VanWoerkom said.
USG votes on the budget allocation next week.

The California Supreme Court declared Monday that hosts who charge a cover fee for entrance into parties can be held liable for underage drinkers who become intoxicated and cause harm to others or themselves, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The court ultimately decided in an unanimous ruling that a cover charge for a party was tantamount to a sale of alcohol and that if minors were present, the hosts would be violating state law.
Some students worry about the implications the ruling has for college campuses such as USC, where some parties have cover fees.
Lauren Egan, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, disagrees with the ruling and believes that it is an issue of individual responsibility.
“I don’t think an organization or a party host should be held responsible,” Egan said. “I think there’s a lot of finger pointing in general. We are legally adults, a lot of us are from 18 to 21 years old and I think that’s old enough to be aware of how much we’re consuming and policing ourselves and to be aware of our actions.”
Other students, such as Max Quilici, a sophomore majoring in pop music, found reason in the court’s ruling.
“I think that decision makes sense to me,” Quilici said. “If a bar is letting people in and selling alcohol to customers, they’re expected to make sure the customers are of age. If you’re the host of a party, it makes sense that you would be expected to make sure the attendees are of age if you’re furnishing alcohol.”
Quilici, however, also believes that cover fees at student parties can be a positive thing for USC students and organizations.
“I think it’s awesome and I’ve seen a lot of young bands fund parts of their record from covers and donations at parties,” he said.
The USC SoCal Vocals, a student a cappella group, is one organization that has used cover fees at parties as fundraising that goes beyond offsetting the costs of alcohol.
“The cover charge our student organization has for parties is not necessarily exclusively used to cover costs of music or drinks and the throwing of the party itself, but for endeavors and goals we are pursuing as a group,” said Myles Nuzzi, business manager for the SoCal Vocals, in an email.
Nuzzi mentioned that the SoCal Vocals used money they fundraised from cover charges at parties to enable them to release an album and compete in international competitions.
“The cost of recording and mixing tracks is astronomical,” Nuzzi wrote. “If we were not able to host parties, we would have trouble pursuing all of these efforts, as would many student organizations who are constantly fundraising.”
In light of the new ruling, Nuzzi encouraged campus organizations to explore alternative methods of fundraising. He mentioned that the SoCal Vocals uses Kickstarter, Indiegogo, album sales and performances already.
“Parties are not the end-all,” he wrote.
Other student organizations that host parties for fundraising were contacted but did not reply in time for print.

The USC women’s swim and dive team is set to compete up north in Federal Way, Wash. for the 2014 Pac-12 Championships. The Women of Troy are ranked No. 2 in the nation and are sending a host of top-notch talent to the Pacific Northwest, including senior All-Americans Kasey Carlson, Meghan Hawthorne and Stina Gardell. The tournament, which will take place in the Weyerhauser King County Aquatic Center, kicks off today and runs through March 1.
A medley of skills · Senior Meghan Hawthorne has been one of the top medley swimmers in the country for the past three years. The two-time All-American placed eighth at the 2013 NCAA Championships in the 200-yard IM. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The Pac-12 Championship is notorious for its stiff competition, and this year’s tournament is no different. In addition to No. 2 USC, the tournament also features national title contenders in No. 1 Stanford, No. 5 California, No. 11 Arizona and No. 16 UCLA in addition to other strong Pac-12 squads.
The Trojans, who have yet to win a single team conference title, lost last year’s Pac-12 team championship in heartbreaking fashion.
The Cardinal edged out the Women of Troy by 21 points, 1439.5 to 1418.5, which was the slimmest margin of victory in the tournament’s history.
As one of the best teams in the nation, the Women of Troy are anchored by versatile top-tier talent. Carlson owns the fastest time in the country for the 100-yard freestyle at 47.22 seconds. Carlson is also the eighth-best swimmer in the 50-yard freestyle event with a time of 21.90 seconds, and fourth in the nation in the 100-yard breastroke, clocking in at 58.61 seconds. Sophomore Kendyl Stewart brings more firepower to the sprint events, including a fourth-ranked time in the 100-yard butterfly at 51.39 seconds.
USC’s swimmers are also competitive in intermediate distance events. Stewart is ranked 11th in the nation in the 200-yard backstroke (1:53.10 seconds), and sophomore Jasmine Tosky is third in the nation in the 200-yard butterfly (1:53.84 seconds). The Women of Troy are also skilled in relay events, with all of their freestyle relay and 200-yard medley relay teams being ranked in the top eight teams in the nation.
The USC women’s dive team is led by former Duke University signee and USC transfer junior Haley Ishimatsu. Ishimatsu, who was a member of the 2008 U.S. Olympic team in the 10-meter platform event, will look to defend her Pac-12 championship this week in Federal Way. The junior brought home the silver medal in the 10-meter synchronized platform diving event in the 2009 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Rome. In her collegiate career, Ishimatsu made a huge splash in the 2013 NCAA Championships by setting the point record in the platform event with a total score of 396.75.
The Women of Troy have been dominant in Pac-12 play this season, going undefeated in team events with the exception of one loss to Stanford in a “battle of the unbeatens” at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. USC will look to avenge its one loss this week and take home the Pac-12 Championship. The event will be televised on tape delay by the Pac-12 Networks on March 3 at 9 p.m. PST.

Rating the NFL Draft Combine prospects for the USC Trojans is a risky exercise — heck, rating the prospects of any draft hopeful is mired in speculation. But one can’t help but wonder how a certain player might perform at the next level. The Trojans have seen their share of NFL successes (Troy Polamalu, Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews and R- – – -e B – – h come to mind).
How Trojans fare in the NFL does play into more than just school spirit — the performance of players in the NFL and the subsequent social capital they gain as standout performers will in turn assist in recruiting down the road. For instance, B – – h’s time at ’SC was instrumental in signing five-star athlete Adoree’ Jackson. The Detroit Lions running back and former Trojan standout experienced a small renaissance with the Lions this past season, recording more than 1,500 all-purpose yards in 14 starts.
But not every Trojan has the makings of such success, and the conclusion of the NFL Combine served as a sobering reality check for many of the Trojans’ pro-hopefuls. I’ve ranked the NFL potential of the Trojans’ skill players who participated in the NFL Scouting Combine this past week.
Marqise Lee (WR)
 
The 2012 Biletnikoff Award winner had a lackluster, injury-ridden 2013 campaign with junior quarterback Cody Kessler at the helm. Lee clocked an unremarkable time of 4.52 seconds in the 40-yard dash, which was slowest of all Pac-12 wide receivers. Aside from speed, one of Marqise Lee’s biggest problems in 2013 was, surprisingly, his pass-catching ability. Though Lee promised “zero drops” in a preseason press conference last spring, the former Trojan wide receiver struggled to build chemistry with Kessler and was frequently overthrown or dropped passes that were on target.
Lee compensated at least partially for his performance this season in the Trojans’ bowl game against Fresno State. The wideout looked like his old self, hauling in seven receptions for 118 yards and two touchdowns. But it’ll be difficult to prove to scouts that he’s the same receiver who ripped apart Pac-12 secondaries in 2012 without quantitative combine statistics to back up his claims.
As for his draft prospects, it would be ideal for Lee to fall into the lap of a team with an established, stable quarterback who can get him the ball in the vein of a Tom Brady with New England or Drew Brees with New Orleans. Lee still has the upper body control and instincts to make defenders miss once he has the ball in his hands, and could be a consistent big play threat in the NFL.
The verdict: starter. With the vast majority of teams who don’t have two high-caliber starting wide receivers, Lee will be a day-one starter in the NFL — and under the right circumstances, he is capable of making the Pro Bowl.
Xavier Grimble (TE)
  At 6-foot-5, 255 pounds, Xavier Grimble has the prototypical body of a hybrid tight-end. With the current trend of tight end-centered offenses, Grimble has perhaps the brightest prospects of any Trojan as far as potential for use in the NFL. Grimble’s sturdy frame is conducive to effective blocking, even at the next level.
Grimble’s greatest asset also happens to be Lee’s current weakness: hands. The Trojan’s high-powered offense in 2012 included countless drives that were saved, or punctuated by, Grimble snatching a Matt Barkley spiral over the middle on an intermediate route. Though Grimble’s 2013 season was, like Lee’s, unremarkable, much of it could be attributed to former head coach Lane Kiffin and offensive coordinator Clay Helton’s play calling. The Trojans’ tight ends were woefully under-utilized in 2013 and Grimble did not have an opportunity to showcase his playmaking gifts.
Verdict: eventual starter. Former USC head coach Ed Orgeron went on the record with Fox Sports to say that Grimble could project as an all-pro tight end in the NFL, but my projection is slightly less optimistic. Provided Grimble gets the reps on a professional team to start with, he could be a solid starting tight end option on a multitude of NFL teams that utilize a tight-end set on offense.
Silas Redd (RB)
 
Former Penn State running back and USC Trojan transfer Silas Redd was part of the Trojans’ highly-touted offense in 2012 but injuries and the Trojans’ choice to employ running back-by-committee in 2013 hurt Redd’s draft stock to the point where Redd is not projected to be drafted in this year’s upcoming draft.
Redd’s biggest question mark is the stability of his surgically repaired knee, which sidelined the former Trojan tailback for eight games last season. His 4.68 40-yard dash time didn’t exactly have scouts jumping up and down, but Redd’s greatest asset as a runner was his toughness and ability between the tackles. During the Trojans’ 2012 season it almost felt as if Redd could fall forward for a gain of four or five yards per carry.
Verdict: Redd’s durability as a runner, his versatility catching passes out of the backfield and his willingness to pick up blocks on off-plays would make him an effective addition to any NFL team’s depth chart — provided his knee has fully recovered and gets the chance. Unfortunately, this is a perception-driven industry and Redd may be too much of a dark horse to make it to the Monday night lights.

For USC’s men’s tennis team, which has won more national championships than any other team in the history of Division I collegiate tennis, history repeating itself is usually a good thing.
Silver lining · Junior Eric Johnson defeated UCLA’s Joseph DiGulio in yesterday’s loss. Johnson was the only USC singles player to win a match. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
But the No. 2 Trojans repeated a part of their history that they’d like to forget yesterday, falling to crosstown rival UCLA 5-2 in Westwood. Specifically, USC experienced a similar sequence from last season, which involved beating the Bruins in the semifinals of the ITA National Team Indoor Championships and then falling in their next matchup.
Last year, then-sophomore Robert Quiroz came up big for the Trojans in the tournament, helping the team eke out a 4-3 victory over UCLA in the semifinal match of the ITA National Indoors. The Trojans fell to eventual national champion Virginia in the final match but returned home encouraged by beating their rivals and making it to the finals.
Less than a week later, the Trojans battled with the Bruins again, but to different results this time. It was UCLA that took home a 4-3 victory and never looked back, beating USC two more times that season.
So when the Trojans pulled off a similar 4-3 win over UCLA in this year’s ITA National Indoor semifinals there might have been some cause for concern, with another meeting with the Bruins looming just a week away on the schedule.
UCLA came into Tuesday’s match boasting the No. 1 singles player in the country in Clay Thompson, as well as the nation’s No. 5 player in Marcos Giron. USC also brought two top-10 players into the matchup in senior captain Ray Sarmiento (No. 6) and Hanfmann (No. 10). Together, Hanfmann and Sarmiento headline a revamped Trojan doubles attack, which has only dropped the doubles point once through 10 matches this season. The duo is USC’s only ranked team in doubles, sitting at No. 12, while UCLA’s Giron and Mackenzie McDonald make up the Bruins’ only ranked doubles team, at No. 25.
In Tuesday’s matchup, the Trojans got off to a hot start and continued their dominance in doubles. Junior Eric Johnson and sophomore Max de Vroome topped UCLA’s Gage Brymer and Karue Sell on court three, 8-3, to get USC off on the right foot. On court one, Hanfmann and Sarmiento edged Giron and McDonald, 8-6, to win the doubles point for USC.
“We won doubles really easily,” said USC head coach Peter Smith. “I think we’re a little better than them in doubles at this point.”
The Trojans headed into singles play after a 45-minute break mandated by the Pac-12 Networks’ broadcast with a 1-0 lead, but found it difficult to maintain that margin. Both teams altered their lineups at the No. 1 and No. 2 singles spots, so Hanfmann found himself playing on court one, while Sarmiento played on court two. Giron, whom Hanfmann defeated in the semifinals of the ITA National Indoors, exacted revenge and beat the Karlsruhe, Germany native, 6-3, 6-4, to tie up the score at 1-1. Giron’s teammates also seemed hungry to take revenge against USC, winning the first set in all of the remaining five matches to put the Trojans on their heels.
“I do think what happens a lot for college guys is they lose and they’re really challenged the next match,” Smith said. “They come out and they’re really ready to go.”
UCLA took the lead when Sell handled de Vroome, dialing up a 6-1, 6-1 victory on court five. When Quiroz fell 6-4, 6-2 to UCLA’s McDonald on court three, the Bruins assumed a 3-1 lead and only needed one more win to clinch the match.
Sarmiento, Johnson and freshman Connor Farren were left to battle it out in hopes of making a comeback, but when Farren went down 7-5, 6-3 to UCLA’s Brymer on court four, he handed the Trojans’ bitter rivals the victory.
Though the Trojans conceded the match, they put one more point on the board when Johnson took down UCLA’s Joseph Di Giulio, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. Sarmiento was the last player to finish, falling to top-ranked Thompson, 1-6, 7-6, 2-6.
“We’ve got to be able to hold serve … and be able to stay in there a little better,” Smith said. “I think it’s hard to learn from this one.”
The Trojans will regroup and head to San Diego on Thursday to take on the USD Toreros before blowing off some steam in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships in La Jolla, Calif.

After two big wins against the University of Hawai’i last week, the men’s volleyball team has a chance to extend its current winning streak to four games with a matchup tonight at Cal Baptist. The Trojans have struggled to find consistency in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation — they have not won four consecutive games all season — but can assert themselves as one of the top teams in the conference with a win.
Makeup sets · Junior setter Micah Christenson started twice last week against the University of Hawai’i after missing USC’s previous two matches due to injury. The Honololu native recorded 81 assists in the two victories. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
Last Thursday, the Trojans (9-5, 8-5 MPSF) took down No. 11 Hawai’i (9-6, 7-5) in four sets by a score of 25-17, 15-25, 25-14, 25-22. The following Saturday the Trojans needed three sets to defeat the Rainbow Warriors by a score of 25-22, 25-20, 25-18. After beating UC San Diego on Feb. 14, the Trojans’ winning streak matches their longest of the season. The team also won their first three games of the year.
“This is the first time we’ve swept a week since I think the beginning of the season,” senior libero Henry Cassiday said. “Every game is crucial in the MPSF, anyone can beat anyone on any given night so it’s just important to get wins.”
Junior setter Micah Christenson suggested the key for the Trojans against Hawai’i was mental more than it was physical.
“I think it was huge to be able to string together the focus that we had for two nights without any let up, because that’s where we’ve struggled in the past,” he said. “We did that for seven sets of volleyball and I’m very happy about that.”
The win had an added sentimental meaning for Cassiday, Christenson and senior outside hitter Maddison McKibbin, who are all natives of Hawai’i.
“It is particularly sweet because I grew up watching the University of Hawai’i,” Cassiday said. “I grew up idolizing those players and to come here and have an opportunity to play them is a really special deal.”
Cal Baptist (3-10, 2-9) fell to USC in four sets at the Galen Center on Jan. 29 by a score of 25-13, 25-22, 21-25, 25-21. Cal Baptist is unranked in the most recent American Volleyball Coaches Association poll while USC rose from to No. 8 to No. 7 after their victories over Hawai’i.
Christenson said the biggest things the team needed to work on heading into the matchup was passing and serving.
“I think we can just clean up some little things,” Christenson said. “I think we can always improve our serving and passing. That’s becoming the determining factor of the men’s game.”
Cassiday said the key to success would be to carry the mental preparation the Trojans brought into the Hawai’i doubleheader into the trip to Cal Baptist.
“It’s always a tough place to play, heading out to Riverside,” Cassiday said. “It’s a smaller gym so we have to create our own energy. As long as we focus on our own deal, serving and passing, that’s the most important thing.”
McKibbin, Cassiday and Christenson started both of the games this weekend along with freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder, freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh, sophomore middle blocker Tommy Leonard and redshirt senior opposite Tanner Jansen.
The team has used a wide variety of starting lineups this year, with Benesh, Cassiday Christenson, and Yoder almost always starting but a mix of young players and veterans rotating into the second outside hitter, second middle blocker and opposite position.
Head coach Bill Ferguson said that he really likes the balance of that group of seven, but said that he wouldn’t declare the starters for Cal Baptist until after practice this week.
“That’s the one great thing about this team,” Ferguson said. “We have so many guys that are so good and can deliver from so many spots and more importantly, they’ve all been team-first. They understand their roles and when it’s their time they’ll be ready — and when it’s not, they’ll be encouraging their teammates that are out on the floor. That’s the really neat thing about this team, is that they’re really together.”

My Woman Crush Wednesday goes to the one and only Julia Child because her love for butter was uncanny but utterly amazing in every way.
As college students, we sometimes do not have the luxury of purchasing all of the ingredients that we would like, so we have to make do. I am a fan of savory and spicy food and absolutely love creating these dishes with the fewest ingredients possible. So this week, I am going to share my favorite appetizer recipe that I created recently: mouthwatering jalapeño poppers.
If you are lactose intolerant or do not eat red meat, I apologize in advance for not satisfying your needs — you can eat these vicariously through your friends. I love my friends, I am lucky to have them and they’re lucky to have me because I make food for them all the time — force of habit, I suppose, but I am more than happy to do so.
A couple of weeks ago, my friend Christina had her 20th birthday party — parties for me always mean food has to be involved. As a good guest, I asked her what she would like me to bring, and she enthusiastically replied, “Jalapeño poppers!” Per her request, I came through with some hot poppin’ and super cheesy jalapeño poppers. These poppers came to me in a dream, and I am sure glad they did, because they turned out way better than I had anticipated — especially since I only used 5 ingredients, and no recipe.
Alegra’s Jalapeño Poppers
Ingredients:
1 package of thick-cut bacon
Half a block of sharp cheddar cheese (grated)
2 cups of Parmesan cheese (grated)
2 cups of cream cheese
16 jalapeños (seeded)
Warning: If you are not familiar with jalapeños, when de-seeding them, make sure to wear gloves — most of all, make sure that you do not put your hands to your face, or your face will feel like it is on fire anyway.
 
Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
While the oven is warming up, you can start cooking the bacon and slicing the jalapeños.
Open the package of thick cut bacon and slice them into one-inch pieces, then place in a frying pan to cook until crispy. When they are cooked, you should throw the extra, fatty grease away. Never put it down the drain — it’ll ruin your pipes.
To cut the jalapeños, start by slicing off the stems, then carefully take out the inside of the pepper and begin de-seeding it with a knife — I usually run them under cold water to keep the smell from making my eyes water.
Now, in order to make the cheesy inside of the jalapeño, strong arms are required. Combine the cream cheese, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses until it looks well-mixed. When the bacon is cooked and the extra oil is drained, add the pieces to the mixture and stir some more.
Take a spoon and fill the jalapeños with the cheese and bacon concoction — be careful not to overfill them. Once all of the peppers are filled, place on a baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Depending on how your oven works, you will want to make sure that they look crispy and that the cheesy filling is melted.
When I made these, I realized that I had some of the cheese mixture left over — no problem. Warm it up in the microwave for two minutes and it turns into a savory dip that you can enjoy with tortilla or pita chips.
My friend Christina had been craving these bad boys since New Year’s Day when she first encountered jalapeño poppers. After I made them for her party, I realized that they were a complete hit, also affirming that anything with bacon makes for a perfect snack, meal, dessert, beverage or appetizer.

Madhuri Shekar was in Los Angeles pursuing her MFA in dramatic writing at USC when she got the phone call from Chennai, India. It was her parents, calling to broach an uncomfortable topic: “It’s time to start thinking about marriage.”
Love and marriage · Madhuri Shekar writes about marriage in modern culture in her play A Nice Indian Boy , playing through March 23. – Photo courtesy of Madhuri Shekar
For 23-year-old Shekar, the question came as a shock.
“My parents are very worldly and they’re very liberal and they’ve traveled so much,” Shekar said. “I honestly didn’t expect them to start saying, like, ‘Well, you have to start meeting boys and start thinking seriously about marriage.’”
Her knee-jerk reaction was to say it was too soon for this conversation. But on the other hand, Shekar understood where her parents were coming from — they had an arranged marriage, and it was a very happy one.
Contemplating whether it could be the right decision for her was what led Shekar to write A Nice Indian Boy, which will be premiering at East West Players today.
“When I started the play, it was almost an exercise in trying to convince myself that if I were to get an arranged marriage, it would be OK,” Shekar said. “It was almost a defense of the Indian system, because I was trying to understand it. Now it’s a celebration of love, but in a way that works for you.”
But the arranged marriage storyline felt overused to Shekar and she was unsure how she could write about it in a new way. A friend’s suggestion sparked the storyline: Why not make this main character, who really wanted to have a traditional Indian marriage, gay?
“Suddenly, it was like the play just opened up to me,” Shekar said. “It would be so amazing to look at marriage, not just in Hindu culture, [or] in Indian culture, but in contemporary American culture. What does marriage mean through the perspective of a gay character who really wants to be married? It just allowed me to turn all these tropes of Indian marriage on its head.”
Shekar, who graduated  from the MFA program in 2013, said she never expected to work in theater. Though she’d always felt drawn to it, she hadn’t seriously thought about pursuing it until she came to USC. While she was getting her master’s degree in global communication, Shekar took a graduate playwriting course for fun.
“I was in a room full of students who understood me and understood my passion because they felt it, too,” Shekar said. “At the end of the semester, [Velina Hasu Houston, USC’s director of Dramatic Writing] said, ‘Why don’t you just apply for the MFA? You clearly love this.’ No one had ever validated me like that before.”
Shekar made the decision to pursue the three-year program. She won the Kendeda Graduate Playwriting Competition in 2014 for her play In Love and Warcraft, which is currently playing at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta. A Nice Indian Boy was Shekar’s thesis project.
She said that her experiences living in different cultures gave her a mixed perspective on why people marry. Shekar was born in San Jose, Calif. but moved to Singapore when she was 6 and then to India when she was 9. She then spent her graduate school years in England and California.
“It’s interesting because American culture says that you have to fall in love to get married,” Shekar said. “You have to date, you have to test each other and see if you’re compatible — but you have to fall in love, and the way in which you fall in love has to happen almost serendipitously. The Indian value system is kind of like, if you know you want to get married, then treat it like anything else in your life: plan for it, be smart about it, do it like you would do a job interview, meet a lot of people that your parents approve of.”
Writing A Nice Indian Boy also gave Shekar a better idea of her own parents’ relationship, as she based the parents in the play on her own.
“I kept finding these moments of really sweet love between the parents,” Shekar said. “I didn’t expect that to come out of me and it’s made me understand my parents so much better.”
Shekar said that one of the most meaningful moments that came out of the play was when her parents flew in to see the reading last year.
“They absolutely loved it,” Shekar said. “They cried and my mom goes, ‘Madhuri, we’ll stop looking for boys for you.’”
 
A Nice Indian Boy will be playing at East West Players from Feb. 20 to March 23.

Gerald Gillum, known as G-Eazy since his rap debut in 2007, is on the verge of breaking out.

After spending many years gaining a grassroots following via free mixtapes released online while finishing college, G-Eazy is currently transitioning into the mainstream music scene as he tries to keep his strong fan following and classic mixtape sound intact. His decision to remain an independent artist without major label support leaves the door open for complete artistic freedom, but is an extremely risky course and will only fare well if executed correctly. If anyone knows how to pull this off, however, it is G-Eazy, who completed a Bachelor’s of Science in the music industry from Loyola University of New Orleans to back up his strong creative instinct.
“These Things Happen,” the title of his current headlining tour as well his upcoming album, is the catalyst for his imminent fame. After spending the past few years opening for artists such as Big Sean, Drake and Lil’ Wayne, G-Eazy said that his current 40-date stateside tour is what he’s been working toward.
“[The tour] is what you build for,” G-Eazy said. “Everything I’ve done in my career has all been building toward this moment when I would eventually have enough momentum to go on a full-fledged tour as the headline act.”
So far the tour has proven to be a strong indication of his success, and the growing craze over his brand is evidenced by sold-out venues filled with enthusiastic fans eager to sing along to some of their favorite songs and get a taste of unheard tracks from the rapper’s forthcoming album. The album These Things Happen, his second LP as an independent artist, is due this spring and the rapper promises it will be an array of his highest quality tracks yet.
“I think it’s a huge step forward both creatively and in regards to my career,” G-Eazy said.
The rapper has a lot of faith in his new album, partly due to the fact that he has matured as a person. This maturity has influenced his rapping skills, his lyrics and production, all of which he is heavily involved with. Because of album delays and a fervent case of perfectionism, G-Eazy has spent the last two years making sure this album is nothing short of the best work he is capable of making.
“If you have two weeks to turn in a paper, and the teacher extends it by two months, you have the chance to put in the effort to make the project near perfect,” G-Eazy said.
The crisp production and confident swagger heard in the rapper’s latest single, “Almost Famous,” matches the superb quality of the visuals in the song’s accompanying music video, released in December. “Almost Famous” is another bullet point on the list of reasons why fans are looking forward to what he has in store for them.
With the traction that he has already created and the eventful schedule he has planned for 2014, it makes perfect sense why G-Eazy chose to name “Almost Famous.”
G-Eazy will be taking the “These Things Happen” tour to Hollywood on Thursday at the Henry Fonda Theatre.

ScHoolboy Q’s Oxymoron, dropped Tuesday, one of the most buzzed-about new albums in the hip-hop world,
Featuring a guest artist lineup that includes the likes of Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, Tyler, the Creator, Jay Rock, Kurupt and Raekwon, Oxymoron was slated to be one of the more critically acclaimed hip-hop albums this year.
Though Oxymoron does feature several great tracks, it fails to deliver a fully-fleshed out album that can be the kind of critically acclaimed release that everyone was expecting. This is not to say, however, that Oxymoron isn’t a solid, well-produced album.
On the contrary, Oxymoron, will most likely deliver several hits that will circulate among hip-hop fans and artists alike.
Tracks such as opening cut “Gangsta,” “Hoover Street” and the single “Collard Greens,” are standouts not just because of the production, but because of ScHoolboy Q’s delivery, which varies on the tracks featured on the album.
“Gangsta” is an excellent track to begin Oxymoron with, and the loud, noise-driven start promises a listening experience that always manages to keep a sense of fun, even when bogged down in mediocre production or predictable beats.
“Collard Greens,” one of four singles released off the album, features minimalist production with spaced-out beats and a simple, driving backing line. Featuring Kendrick Lamar, it is one of the strongest tracks on the album, with a sing-songy chorus that is sure to gain heavy rotation on hip-hop radio and on personal playlists. Not only is “Collard Greens” immediately catchy, but it also features tight production and flow on ScHoolboy Q’s part.
The variety in production, which testifies to the various work done on the album by the likes of Pharrell, The Alchemist, Mike WiLL Made It and DJ Dahi, is what keeps listeners interested even when the direction of the album feels muddled.
On tracks such as the Soundwave-produced “Hoover Street,” the production shows great potential but never quite manages to make it a really great track. The bass line at the beginning is a throwback to more classic, jazz-based rap groups such as The Roots and A Tribe Called Quest, but ScHoolboy Q’s flow is all new — a straight delivery that contrasts well with the backing jazz production.
As the track progresses, however, it seems disorganized and not quite sure of the  direction it wishes to go in. It alternates between the muddled production found on tracks such as “What They Want” and the excellent jazz-based production that started off the track.
“What They Want” is noteworthy for featuring everyone’s new favorite rapper, 2 Chainz. What had the potential to be a really great hit gets bogged down by 2 Chainz’s heavy-handed rapping and the sluggish production. Though the track is guaranteed to be on everyone’s radar because of 2 Chainz’s wide appeal, it emerges as one of the weaker tracks on the album through its muddied sound, which detracts to the song’s atmosphere.
Tracks such as “Los Awesome” and “Studio” fall into the same trap as well. “Los Awesome,” a weaker track with more generic production, is easier to take in when listened to in the context of the album, and “Studio” comes off as a smooth, slick track that’s pleasant but generic.
Oxymoron doesn’t really have any bad tracks. Rather, it has several great tracks built on a foundation of more generic and mediocre but appealing — cuts. It isn’t a bad album, but it certainly isn’t the kind of critically acclaimed album that the hype made it out to be.
Though the wait was worth it for some of the tracks on the album, there remains much more for ScHoolboy Q to do if he wants to gain the kind of solid critical acclaim and following of other hip-hop artists.
One of the best tracks on the album is also one of the most-talked about one: “The Purge,” which features Tyler, The Creator and Kurupt, is a great example of the kind of tracks ScHoolboy Q can make on his next release.
Both Tyler, The Creator and Kurupt represent two wholely different generations in hip-hop, but are grounded in the same dark, narrative storytelling that dominates their releases. Bringing both of these artists together not only brings out the best in ScHoolboy Q’s lyrical delivery, but also creates a track that listeners can repeat over and over again and still find something to sink their teeth into.
All three artists shine on the track, and since one of the main draws of Oxymoron is its guest artist lineup, ScHoolboy Q could use great pairings such as the one on “The Purge” to really build solid releases.
Most of the time, ScHoolboy Q’s flow on Oxymoron is tight, and so is the production. But both elements flounder at times, and that’s what prevents Oxymoron from reaching greatness.
A solid release, but by no means an instant classic, Oxymoron could owe its flaws to the fact that it is ScHoolboy Q’s first release under a major label. Oxymoron testifies, however, to what ScHoolboy Q can do, even under the constraints of Interscope records.
Oxymoron gave the hip-hop world a couple of good hits, but we’re still waiting for ScHoolboy Q to break through the hype and drop an album that will have staying power beyond the year it is released.

Support systems are crucial in college. From the financial support of family members to the moral support of friends, a network of caring people will make the rigor and stresses of college more manageable and enjoyable. A new proposal to create permanent Hindu prayer rooms on all U.S. college campuses should continue to extend the support systems available for a variety of students.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
Last week, Universal Society of Hinduism President Rajan Zed said institutions of higher education should provide spaces for Hindu students to perform their religious rituals. Zed was responding to the decision by Brandeis University in Massachusetts to cancel the opening ceremony of a Hindu prayer room. In Hinduism, prayer rooms are used as places of worship and meditation. Citing the presence of churches, temples and mosques on several U.S. campuses, the proposal aligns the importance of Hinduism with other major religions.
In the United States, there are three million Hindus. Furthermore, Hinduism ranks as the third largest world religion behind Christianity and Islam, according to a Pew Research study. With these significant numbers, there are undoubtedly Hindu students attending colleges and universities throughout the United States — a majority of whom do not have access to a prayer room to practice their faith.
Reportedly, after Brandeis University cancelled the ceremony for the dedication of the Hindu prayer room, the school replaced it with a conversation about sharing space across religious lines. Though ironic, it also highlights the importance of creating space for each student, regardless of his or her background.
The journey to install Hindu prayer rooms on every college campus will be a long and difficult process, especially on denominational campuses. On USC’s campus, there are currently several religious centers where students can practice their faith. Of the six places to worship on or near campus, however, none are specifically designated Hindu -prayer rooms, according to the university’s Office of Religious Life. This should not be the case. Student organizations can mobilize themselves to change the lack of representation of a major world religion. Yet in the same way, the discussion on a lack of space has been taken up by several other factions of USC students at the University Park campus.
During last May’s #USChangeMovement, which was a response to a perceived case of racial profiling by the Los Angeles Police Department against USC students, the social movement’s leaders asked that more spaces be created for students of color. Students argued that if there were designated spaces to have fun and socialize together, then they would not be put into positions of defending themselves against LAPD. Similar to the call for a prayer room, the creation of a safe place to socialize shows that the interests of a wide range of students are being heard. It also shows that support systems are being created to retain these students.
Ultimately students need their space. At an urban campus such as USC, where space is limited and construction is constant, the administration should consciously focus on how space is being filled as well as the ultimate benefit it will have on students. A Hindu prayer room or a house for social gatherings might not be implemented on campus in the near future, but right now schools can start thinking of ways to improve their students’ experience. Access to space to practice religion and all other avenues to grow as an individual is a crucial first step.

Last week, Kevin Roose of New York Magazine published a scathing exposé of the 80th annual initiation dinner of Kappa Beta Phi, a secret society of Wall Street tycoons.
What took place inside the St. Regis Hotel that night, however, confirmed every negative stereotype of the country’s ultra-rich in stunning detail. Diners tucked in to meals of racks of lamb, foie gras and petit fours. KBP neophytes dressed in drag and sang parodies of musical numbers on stage, including a parody of The Book of Mormon’s hit ballad “I Believe.” Some of the parodied lyrics included “I believe that God has a plan for all of us / I believe my plan involves a seven-figure bonus.”
Americans often take media depictions with a grain of salt, assuming that most representations of the wealthy by the media lie on the more sensational side. It comes as a surprise, then, that the KBP dinner events illustrated the beliefs and habits of United States’ ultra-rich as a disturbing collapse between reality and caricature, with the kind of combination of self-pity and disregard for others that borders on self-parody.
But isn’t throwing petit fours at a bunch of high-powered executives dressed in drag the Wall Street everyone expected? Isn’t this the age of the “Progressive Kristallnacht,” or persecution of the “successful few” by the many, as Tom Perkins so audaciously suggested in a letter to the Wall Street Journal?
The reality lies somewhere in between; though Wall Street suffers from an image problem, the fact remains that vitriolic criticism of Wall Street is doing nothing to help the problem.
Social psychologist Paul Piff explored the idea of wealth making individuals less compassionate and empathetic in an October 2013 TED Talk. In one of the experiments, Piff had two participants play a game of Monopoly with one catch: One player starts at a distinct advantage over another player, including extra cash. Piff noted that the advantaged player began to justify his successes to a sense of entitlement. To his credit, it was partially justified: The participants in an advantageous position were able to parlay their advantage into further success.
As William Shakespeare once wrote in Julius Caesar, “lowliness is young ambition’s ladder.” Many of the executives rose to their positions with a combination of skilled decision-making and determination. For lack of a better phrase, these executives are at least partially entitled to their sense of entitlement. In a sector such as Wall Street, where the only way to make a living is to make someone else money, it only stands to reason that these men or women would worship money. The logic behind criticizing a Wall Street banker for worshipping money would be akin to criticizing an athlete for wanting to win games, or criticizing a chef for wanting high- quality ingredients. At the end of the day, all of these things contribute to the perception of excellence in their respective fields — a Wall Street banker’s evidence just happens to be more directly financial.
This doesn’t absolve the Wall Street members of Kappa Beta Phi of their actions. Though they had an expectation of privacy, the amount of self-pity and bitter opposition to progressivism are telling. What these bankers are exhibiting through their sense of entitlement is a failure to understand their responsibility as wielders of significant financial capital.
The type of critical discourse employed by the 99 percent, however, only serves to galvanize the two factions. Instead of separating society between the “haves” and “have-nots,” the public discourse should be trying to foster a sense of collective responsibility toward bettering the world. Though the financial autonomy of individuals might vary drastically from person to person, personal human autonomy is a far more equal playing field. To that effect, there are those who abuse power and those who understand their responsibilities.
In another experiment from the previously mentioned TED Talk, participants of varying socioeconomic backgrounds watched a short segment on impoverished children, and all of them seemed to exhibit an equal amount of capability for empathy and compassion. Piff then went on to note that some of the wealthiest individuals in the world, including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, have pledged a considerable amount of their fortunes to improving the conditions of disadvantaged individuals.
Former New York Mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg encapsulated this sentiment best in a 2012 interview with Scott Pelley of CBS Evening News.
“I’ve been very lucky in terms of making a lot of money and I’m going to give it all away,” Bloomberg said. “I’ve always said, my great ambition in life is to bounce the check to the undertaker.”
This only belabors the point: No matter how much one gains in his or her time in life, the only thing that lasts beyond the grave is the impact he or she makes on the world. It’s a concept that shouldn’t be relegated only to the one percent or the 99 percent of the United States, but 100 percent of the world.

Euno,
Economic disparity can be reduced to a few statistics. 
1.) Between 1945 and 1975, America created the strongest middle-class the world had ever seen. This was done via 100% progressive fiscal policy. During this period, millionaires and billionaires were created en masse, but NOT at the expense of a healthy middle-class. By 1975, the 99% owned 80% of American wealth, the healthiest economic period in American (and perhaps world) history.
2.) After 1975, the tax code radically changed. The 99% continued to pay a progressive tax, but the 1% were gifted with a REGRESSIVE tax system (too complex to get into here) that was called “trickle down economics”. Since 1975, the 1% has grown their share of U.S. wealth from 20% to 36%, and by 2020 should be at 40%. This near DOUBLING of 1% wealth came from the pockets of the middle-class. Since 1975, the middle-class has shrunk 18%, and continue to shrink. The wealth has not been “trickling down” — it has been TRICKLING UP. 
http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html
The result?
3.) More people are living in poverty today than at any time since they started keeping census data in 1959.
4.) 1 in 5 Americans are now on food stamps – more than at any time since the program started.
5.) Fully HALF of all American children will be on food stamps before their 18th birthday – more than at any time in history.
6.) 77% of families are living paycheck-to-paycheck, with little or no savings to cover emergencies. Household savings rates are today at their lowest moving average in modern U.S. history (this isn’t due to low interest rates — compare with China’s low interest rates but historically high household savings).
7.) American middle-class debt ratios are at their highest point in modern history.
8.) From 1945-1980, America had the highest GDP per capita in the world, by far. Today, we’re #13, and falling.
http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_percap-economy-gdp-per-capita
Since 1975, while the 99% has been falling deeper and deeper into economic despair, the 1% has accumulated more of the U.S. wealth pie than at any time since before the Great Depression. In fact, some have noted that today’s massive economic disparity looks identical to the disparity that (in part) triggered the Great Depression: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_T2gpIK0VzFw/S8jJitoRJSI/AAAAAAAAAXE/LClwMBAMK3Q/s1600/Gap+that+Gave+Us+the+Great+Depression.jpg
9.) 90% of national news is controlled by just 6 corporations, and those 6 corporations have only one goal: to maximize advertising revenue. They maximize revenue via addictive polarization, both left and right, creating and sustaining a false sense of anger, distrust, fear (of the other side), and blame. Oh, and these 6 news outlets are owned by the 1%, so you are not going to hear any reporting about these massive wealth and income imbalances that are destroying our country and our liberties.
Carl,
I wonder why is it that these facts cannot be synthesized to concise sound bites that the middle class and impoverished can understand?  It does not take my USC degree to understand this.  These facts are clear.  Yet, somehow these groups continue to vote against their financial interest.
I keep making more dollars yet they don’t go as far and I get to save less.  It isn’t the cut that the tax man takes that is doing this.  It is easy for me to see this.  The percentage stays the same but it may be one dollar more the next year that I pay to the Feds.  I don’t scream about that dollar. 
It is the cable TV bill, it is the gallon of gas, it is the bank fee, it is the gallon of milk, it is price of insurance (and I don’t mean Obamacare,) it is the price of a movie ticket.  These “taxes” are being collected by the ultra rich, not Uncle Sam.  It is not paying for the poor to survive that is eating away at middle class wealth.  It is paying for the next mansion and the next boat and the next Ferrari and the next island vacation of the 1%.  Entitlements are the problem, the entitlements of those who feel entitled to their wealth.  Luck and initial stature are two parts of a formula that includes brains and hard work to create success.  The entitled never pay deference to the first 50% of the equation.  If the richer you got the less entitled you felt we would not have to deal with this issue.
I do fear that this wealth gap will lead to French Revolution style ethos.  History has shown what happens when the haves and havenots get too far apart.  Not enough armies and policeman that are paid well enough to stand in front of the mob with a guillotine.

I thought I knew what people like about The Lego Movie. I saw Wall-E and Toy Story and enjoyed their substantive messages, and their occasional one-liners that “only an adult would understand.” Still, those films were created primarily for kids, and say very little about the state of contemporary culture. In fact, until I saw The Lego Movie, I didn’t think a kid’s movie could say much about the way we live now. But when I saw it, I realized that its unconventional form is exactly what makes it such a representative postmodern and millennial film.
President Business from ‘The Lego Movie’ | Photo courtesy of Flicker/Brickster
In the film, Will Ferrell voices President Business, the president of the “Octan Corporation and the world.” President Business represents a fascinating (and often hilarious) vision of the increasing incest between politics, media and consumerism. In his first appearance, he is presiding over the production of a TV show, signing autographs, approving a new PR campaign for “Taco Tuesdays” and signing legislation, all while walking to his office.
President Business has created a world in which every aspect of society is unabashedly designed to perpetuate consumerism, which one might call the media-industrial complex. He has kidnapped all of the “master builders,” those who are capable of building things without instructions, and forces them to churn out the blueprints for his profit-making empire. These master builders are eerily reminiscent of many of our culture’s most popular artists, who are increasingly becoming ambassadors of consumerism, like Bob Dylan in his recent Super Bowl ad. The regime’s theme song, “Everything is Awesome,” and its most popular TV show, “Where are my pants?” feel like only slightly exaggerated versions of our most blatantly commodified attempts at culture.
An underground resistance to President Business’s regime emerges, similar to that depicted in The Matrix trilogy. However, unlike the stoic intensity of Neo and Morpheus, the resistance group in The Lego Movie displays a veritable exposé of millennial sensibilities. One character, for example, continuously and self-consciously changed her name in her youth before finally settling on Wyldstyle, because it truly represented her. Members of the resistance also deliver a constant stream of ironic one-liners that are funny in a markedly different way from the occasional appeals to adults in a film like Toy Story. Meritocracy, creativity, and individuality are also important characteristics of this group. In fact, directors Phil Lord and  Christopher Miller capture young people’s ways of communicating perhaps even more accurately in this film than they did in 21 Jump Street, a perceptive and brilliant work in its own right.
But what are Lord and Miller saying by presenting the resistance movement, with its millennial sensibilities, in direct opposition to President Business and the media-industrial complex? On the surface, it would appear that these two entities and the ways of living they represent are fundamentally at odds, simply in terms of what they value and how they communicate.
Yet, the film’s live action scenes straddle the line between touching and absurd, featuring a father (played by Will Ferrell) who has constructed an elaborate Lego world, and his son, who has created the resistance narrative, and emphasizing the futility of this generational struggle.
Someday, millennials will control the world created by our “ridiculous” parents. Significantly, the filmmakers don’t tell us whether we have the capacity to fundamentally change anything about our world, even after we take control. The characters in the resistance are remarkably superficial, and appear deeply indoctrinated into certain aspects of the media-industrial complex, with the exception of their disdain for President Business himself. This observation leads me to believe that after President Business’s downfall, creativity and originality will continue to be commodified, but in a subtler way, thus perpetuating consumerism with a gentler hand.
The question, then, is, if this is what Lord and Miller were trying to say, why do it in a kid’s movie about Legos?  As for the Legos, perhaps we are entering a trans-human era of culture, in which non-human entities are better allegorical tools than real humans. The choice of medium, on the other hand, seems to be an ironic statement in itself. Millennial exceptionalism can be viewed as a child’s exploration of an absurd grown-up world controlled by systems that can be hard to take seriously.

The Trojans would be expected to enter the season’s first away game against the Long Beach State Dirtbags at Blair Field with confidence, given their 5-3 victory last Sunday over North Dakota State thanks to the walk-off home run in the 12th inning by junior Omar Cotto Lozada.
This assumed confidence, however, could be checked by the Trojans’ less-than-stellar away game record of 9-19 from the 2012-2013 season, though one of those victories was over the Dirtbags on Feb. 26, 2013.
So far USC boasts an undefeated record of 7-0 for the 2014 season under second-year head coach, Dan Hubbs. This marks much improvement from the 4-3 record the Trojans held at this time in 2013, signaling progress in the cohesiveness and experience of this young team.
The Dirtbags have gotten off to a rocky start this season, currently holding a 2-5 overall record and a 2-3 home record. The Dirtbags hold the advantage in experience, though, with 23 returning players under fourth-year coach Troy Buckley.
The last time these two teams met, the Trojans rose victorious over the Dirtbags in a 4-1 victory at USC’s Dedeaux Field. Long Beach State held close to the Trojans through seven innings but allowed USC to score two runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, leading to a Trojan victory.
So far this season the Trojans haven’t always been able to turn hits into runs. Last Sunday, the Trojans couldn’t take advantage of scoring opportunities such as three leadoff singles, stranding six runners.
USC remained scoreless through the first seven innings against the Bison until senior third basemen Kevin Swick ripped a single up the middle, allowing for sophomore infielder AJ Ramirez to run home from second base.
The Trojans hope to make a much more impressive offensive showing tonight against the Dirtbags’ pitching staff, who have struggled to consistently make outs this season. So far, Long Beach State pitchers have a total 4.13 ERA.
USC will hope to take advantage of this less-than-impressive statistic by consistently getting men on base in scoring position. This seems to be fairly probable, given the continuing improvements in the Trojans’ overall batting average, which currently is .303.
This impressive number can be attributed to each of the nine starters with special thanks to senior catcher Jake Hernandez and Ramirez, who both currently hold a batting average over .400.
The Trojans must face only the Dirtbags before heading back to Dedeaux Field to battle the Cal Poly Mustangs in a three game series, hoping continuing their home game success.
USC will take the field against Long Beach State tonight at Blair Field at 6 p.m.
