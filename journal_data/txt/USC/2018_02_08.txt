This past week saw Undergraduate Student Government election campaigning in full swing. Senatorial candidates participated in a meet-and-greet with the student body, and presidential candidates discussed diversity and inclusion at a second forum event. And throughout these events, there has been the chaotic buzz characteristic of all campaign seasons. 
Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
Balancing class and other commitments with election-related business is a challenge for candidates, campaign teams, USG election and communications officials and the student journalists who report on the elections to give the student body a fair, accurate image of events. Naturally, perfect communication and adherence to protocol is challenging, as everyone involved in student body elections is also a full-time student. But nonetheless, students have the right to transparency and the accurate, timely presentation of information from student government in order to make informed decisions.
So far this campaign season, USG has struggled to meet its own guidelines and standards for transparency.
Last Monday, the Debbie & Blake presidential ticket accused the Mai & Brianna presidential ticket of misconduct regarding the creation of a campaign graphic at a hearing. Yet, the elections committee failed to release a transcript of the hearing to the public “as soon as a verdict” was “reached,” as elections code XIII.D mandates. 
The delayed release was attributed to “unforeseen circumstances and technical difficulties,” and a week later, the released transcript was notably edited. Many parts had been removed from the original transcript without explanation.
In the updated transcript, more than 50 percent of comments made by the Mai & Brianna ticket as it responded to accusations were partially or fully excluded in the original transcript. Twenty-five percent of the Debbie & Blake ticket’s comments were partially or fully excluded. Some comments made by the Elections Commission were partially or fully excluded, as well. 
According to both presidential candidates, the Elections and Recruitment team had failed to notify them about changes made to the transcript.
The Daily Trojan repeatedly reached out to USG for comment on why portions of the transcript had been removed, but neither the USG Elections and Recruitment Team nor USG’s director of communications responded to multiple requests for comment. USG did not decline to comment, but instead ignored media requests and did not offer a date to expect a response. It appeared no effort was made to meet student media halfway in answering such important questions as why the transcript had been heavily modified. 
It is worth noting that USG’s Election Commission and Recruitment team, as well as its communications director, are paid positions, reinforcing the importance of their service and adequate completion of their governing duties. Those who fill these positions are awarded stipends to complete the tasks required of them, such as, in the case of the communications director, answering questions and working with student media.
Of course, the burden for lack of transparency and accountability for student government does not fall on media. Rather, it falls on members of the student body who are left in the dark about how the student government and its elections committee are handling the election, and about dialogue between the presidential tickets that undergraduate voters will be choosing between. 
Lack of cooperation from USG is preventing media outlets like the Daily Trojan from providing voters the complete facts they need to make an informed decision come the election days. The student body deserves better.
Given that the two presidential tickets share similar platform points and leadership experiences, the race will likely be a competitive one. This makes complete information and transparency about hearings and USG committee decisions all the more important.
The decisions USG makes regarding the election, from how the Elections team decides to hold hearings to address some complaints and not others, to why hearing transcripts are edited and excerpted, must be public information. Decisions affecting the election are decisions that affect all undergraduate students.
As previously noted, USG comprises full-time students who show respectable initiative just by balancing the responsibilities of student government positions with all of their other academic commitments. But one of these responsibilities must be communication with student media and, through student media, the student body. Those who choose to get involved with student government, particularly within the Elections team and communication branches, must be especially prepared to communicate come elections season, a time when the student body needs  and deserves full transparency ahead of making a crucial decision.

USC’s  Graduate Student Government held its first-ever International Student Appreciation Week on campus this week, a program that was designed to emphasize the presence of the USC international community — which represents nearly 25 percent of USC’s total student body.

In efforts to help integrate the international students into the community, each day this week featured two events, including  resource fairs, food fairs, film screenings and a luncheon with President C. L. Max Nikias. 
The need for an allotted time dedicated to international students became clear when executive board members for GSG noticed that approximately 30 percent of USC’s graduate students are international students. 
“It was important to us that we take seriously the unique challenges facing such a large percentage of our student population,” Tori Montrose, vice president of programming for GSG, explained in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Together, Montrose and Judy Kang, vice president of advocacy at GSG, successfully pitched and organized a week of events designed to increase education, inclusion and fun for international students on campus.
“With shifting federal policies such as the travel ban that seemed to change week to week, 2017 was a challenging year for international students in the U.S.,” Montrose said. “During this time, both Judy and I were serving as executive board members for GSG (in different positions than we both currently hold) and we were working together on brainstorming ways to increase support for our own international students here at USC.” 
Montrose and Kang both strongly emphasized working to diminish the “silo effect” of international students feeling isolated from the domestic student population. They hope that going forward, USC can help foster a demonstrated interest in domestic students to support their international peers. 
One of the major events during the week was a panel discussion on “International Students and Diplomacy” with Abdul Jabbar Memon, the Consul General of Pakistan in Los Angeles, and public diplomacy professor Nicholas Cull on Thursday.
Vicky Sung, a graduate student studying communication management, attended the panel discussion. 
“It was actually pretty interesting because Dr. Cull … talked about listening and how we can advocate for international friendship with just the simple act of listening,” Sung said.  “It was really interesting and made me think about my role as an international student on this campus.”
The week also featured food and resource fairs at both the UPC and HSC campuses. Students could meet with any of 20 campus resource centers and student organizations at the resource fair, which also featured mascots from the 2018 Winter Olympics, a photo booth and Professor Beau, USC’s wellness dog. 
“We had such a big turn out [of] about 100 [people] and students enjoyed food and talking to campus partners,” Kang said.
The week’s events also featured two international film screenings, a “Coffee Hour” with USC’s International Services and a trivia night about the Winter Olympics. 
Montrose said the week was made possible through support from campus partners for the events they put on.
“This is the first year we’re doing it, so there is still much to be improved,” Montrose said. “We had a lot of support from campus partners like the Office of International Services, the International Student Assembly, the Association of International Graduate Students and off-campus partners such as the Korean Cultural Center of Los Angeles.” 
Montrose hopes to expand the International Student Appreciation Week in the future to further address the needs of students. 
“I hope going forward that this event gains even more on and off campus collaborators so we can maximize our reach… [also], the organizers plan to continue intentionally thinking about the shifting needs of international students so the event can evolve over time to maintain relevance,” Montrose said.

When Facebook and Snapchat proved to be unreliable methods of finding community at their universities in Finland, Vili Väänänen, a student attending USC through its international exchange program, along with co-founder Max Prokopenko, started Highkey. The app allows students to be aware of the liveliest locations on the USC campus at any given time.

“It’s an interactive map where students can upload multimedia content such as videos, pictures and text, and eventually in the upcoming week, comments about things that they see on campus in specific spots that we have designated,” said Ankit Shah, the Highkey Director of Marketing and a freshman in the world bachelor in business program.
Before attending USC, Väänänen and Prokopenko both studied in Finland at the Aalto University School of Business and Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, respectively.
They wanted a way to know where the parties and popular events were around campus. Although they resorted to Facebook, the two were unable to find specific details, such as the attendance numbers, of each event. 
This experience was a catalyst for them to brainstorm an app that could help students stay up to date with popular social and academic events. 
The application, called Populic in Finland, was originally launched last May and gained the attention of several Finnish social media celebrities, who began to promote it through their channels. According to Väänänen, Highkey became the number one trending app in their country two days after its release. 
“For publicizing, we obviously have a different challenge over here because in Finland, we had social media stars and it’s very easy when you have a big country to promote your app,” Väänänen said. “But over here, [USC] is already quite small so we have to find the right people here.” 
According to Sebastian Huang, the Highkey assistant marketing director and a freshman majoring in business administration, the app has a map of the campus that ranks the top events and locations in real time. At each location, students can post videos and pictures. The more content an event has, the more popular it becomes on the app. The hottest spots on campus will then glow, notifying users of where students are. 
Although there are only default locations set, the team hopes to add a feature where students can add their own events onto the interactive map.
“There are already a lot of things that need to be improved and a lot of our core features aren’t in yet just because it takes so long for development,” Shah said. “Like one of our core features is we’re going to have a ‘Create Your Own Spot.’ If we were doing something cool in McCarthy Quad, I could create a spot and my friends could add to it. At the moment, there are only preset spots because we need to get more users on board.” 
Huang said the app is more effective than other similar programs because of its distinct map feature.
“[With] Snapchat, you can only see where your friends are at all times,” Huang said. “But with our app, you can see where everyone is and that really instills a sense of community that Snapchat and Toga don’t really fulfill.”
As of now, Highkey is working to partner with campus organizations such as the Chinese American Student Association, Residential Education and Greek life to expand its reach at USC. 
“I just hope organizations here can find that they can shout out their events in our app in a much more efficient way than Snapchat or Toga,” Väänänen said.

USC researcher Denis Evseenko and his team at the Keck School of Medicine have synthesized a new molecule which can potentially help patients with arthritis avoid joint replacement surgery. 
Denis Evseenko is the lead researcher of a Keck team that has synthesized a new molecule that can stimulate cartilage regeneration and prevent long-term degeneration for arthritis patients. Photo courtesy of the Keck School of Medicine.
The researchers have published their findings in the Annals of Rheumatic Diseases on Wednesday detailing the new molecule named “Regulator of Cartilage Growth and Differentiation,” or RCGD 423, for short. 
RCGD 423 both enhances the regeneration of damaged cartilage and lessens the inflammation in cartilage. Evseenko’s research revealed that when the molecule was added to damaged joint cartilages of rats, the cells proliferated more, and the animals healed more effectively from their injuries.
RCGD 423 brings about these effects by communicating with glycoprotein 130 receptors. Gp130 receives signals that promote cartilage development in the embryo, as well as those that trigger chronic inflammation which affects some adults. 
However, RCGD 423 increases the Gp130’s ability to receive the developmental signals that can stimulate cartilage regeneration, while also blocking the inflammatory signals that can lead to cartilage degeneration over the long term.
“The goal is to make an injectable therapy for an early to moderate level of arthritis,” Evseenko said in the press release. “It’s not going to cure arthritis, but it will delay the progression of arthritis to the damaging stages when patients need joint replacements, which account for a million surgeries a year in the U.S.”
Evseenko envisions the synthesized molecule as a prototype for future anti-inflammatory drugs. In the lab, RCGD 423 has already been proven effective to activate stem cells to make hair grow. The laboratory is currently collaborating with more researchers at USC as well as other institutions to see the potential the molecule has to treat other disorders, including neurological and heart diseases.

On Wednesday evening, the USC Speakers Committee, Political Student Assembly and Asian Pacific American Student Association hosted a night dedicated to “embracing differences” with guest speaker Hasan Minhaj. The series of events hosted by the organizations aims to highlight what it means to be an Asian Pacific American through a series of diverse speakers. 
Hasan Minaj performed a stand-up routine at the packed Bovard Auditorium Wednesday evening. Photo from Facebook.
Minhaj is currently a comedian and senior correspondent on The Daily Show and the Netflix special, Homecoming King, launched in May last year. 
Senior Nav Pillai served as Minhaj’s opening act — an appropriate choice, claimed Pillai, as they are both “exceptionally good-looking brown men.” A charged Bovard audience roared as Pillai, who began working on his stand-up just last semester, joked about the universal struggles of having Asian parents and wishing he could have gone to Hogwarts. 
In accordance with his Daily Show reputation, Minhaj’s set took a more politicized approach to comedy. Specifically, he discussed issues surrounding immigration and racial prejudice using his signature animated graphs and news footage as evidence. He recounted his visit to the Mexican border, where he was tasked with reviewing the eight prototypes of President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall — “the Goldilocks of racism,” as he called them. The anecdote led to a powerful message regarding the false stereotypes of immigrants in American society: “When an immigrant knocks on your door, it’s an Indian guy there to set up your wifi. A white person knocking on your door is terrifying — it could be the feds, an ICE agent.” 
Moreover, Minhaj did not shy away from addressing the stereotypes that accompany Muslims in America. Minhaj joked about when a gun salesman in Alabama questioned why Muslim women dressed “like ninjas” and compared it to the repressed women of  Disney fairytales. 
“White Disney princesses are some Sharia law sh-t,” Minhaj said. “Cinderella is forced to befriend mice! Who makes their women befriend mice?” 
In comparison, Disney princesses of color experience more freedom and power: “When Princess Jasmine’s dad tells her she needs to get an arranged marriage, she says, ‘F-ck you!’ And then she flies on a magic carpet with a Muslim guy whose best friend is a monkey,” he joked. 
Minhaj also took the opportunity to introduce various statistics that contradict common prejudices about the potential danger of immigrants and terrorism. For instance, according to the CATO Institute, one in 3.6 billion people are killed by a refugee. 
“You have a higher chance being buried alive!” Minhaj exclaimed. Moreover, Minhaj asserted that three in 784,000 refugees were associated with terrorism. To emphasize the lack of danger posed by refugees, Minhaj interviewed an underwriter at an insurance company and found that purchasing insurance to protect oneself from terrorism was significantly cheaper than purchasing insurance to safeguard from “Kanye going crazy at a Kanye concert.” 
“This is a rational argument to an irrational fear,” Minhaj said.
As photos of Syrian refugees appeared on the stage screen, Minhaj softened his tone: “These are people that are fleeing persecution and fighting for a chance to save their humanity. We’re on our third travel ban now; if these people are willing to wait in line for two years to have a chance to enter this country, we should at least consider their applications.” 
After his set, Minhaj stayed to answer audience questions about his life and the future of comedy.

I began writing this week’s column while sitting in Montreal, Canada in 10-degree Fahrenheit weather. Outside my window, I saw the pavement frozen over and people bundled up in their hoods with their breath lingering in the air. If you had told me two years ago that I would travel to Montreal and represent USC’s Model United Nations team, I probably would have laughed. And yet, just weeks ago, I sat in a hotel room with some of the people who have become a defining part of my college experience, with a community that means more to me than I ever thought possible.
Model United Nations is a bizarre concept — high school and college students pretending that they are historical figures and countries, working out solutions to problems such as human trafficking, planning the 2020 FIFA World Cup in Qatar or even simulating a magical committee from Harry Potter. I stumbled upon MUN at the Involvement Fair, and I joined with decent conversational skills but no experience in either MUN or debate, and absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. The first few months were difficult, especially as most of my new member class had participated in MUN before. I often felt like I had no idea what was going on, with terms like moderated “caucus,” “rules and procedure” and “dividing the question” being thrown around. But like many other defining experiences of college — classes, social scenes and living environments — being thrust into an entirely new situation is often what teaches you the most about yourself. 
Reflecting on the last year and a half, I realize how fortunate I was to find a home so early on in my college career. The stable and supportive community MUN provided during my first semester was one of the reasons that I felt at home at USC so quickly.
But one thing I also realized after talking to my friends at other schools is that this sense of community is something rare and somewhat unique to USC. Student organizations rarely have the presence and impact on campuses that USC student organizations do — and those that do are far smaller in number. 
Art by Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
Every year as I walk down Trousdale Parkway during the Involvement Fair, I am always impressed by how many people I see passionate about their causes and willing to give their all to ensure their objectives are achieved. I know some of my editors at the Daily Trojan, work in the newsroom until 2 a.m. to make sure that a professional-grade newspaper is produced every single day, all while balancing an admirable workload of school work — because they love journalism. I see my classmates who are student-athletes spend at least 4-6 hours a day practicing to getting better — because they love it. I see my friends leading service organizations with over 100 members, dedicated to making the community around them a better place — because they care. I am constantly inspired by the level of dedication that everyone on this campus seems to have for experiences inside and outside of the classroom, and it’s one of the first things I mention when people ask me why and what I love about USC. 
If you’re reading this and feel like you haven’t found your place on campus, I assure you there is something here for you. You heard it from every tour guide on every campus tour you visited, but you chose USC and you are here for a reason. As intimidating as clubs, organizations and other groups may seem, it is worth exploring and pushing yourself out of your immediate circle to find this type of home. The likelihood that some organization will change you in some way is high, just as you will likely change the organization. 
I often think about the legacy that I want to leave at USC. Coming from a small high school, leaving my mark on USC once seemed intimidating and sometimes impossible. But we have the opportunity, through these organizations, to determine what someone else’s future USC experience could look like. I certainly know that the time, effort and passion that my predecessors at MUN put in have had more of an impact on my life than they ever could have imagined.

Goapele’s impressive 17-year career has yielded six studio albums, the latest being Dreamseeker, which was released in May 2017. The singer often infuses issues of social justice into her songs. Photo courtesy of Beto Lopez.
The act of chasing one’s dreams isn’t a flimsy New Year’s Resolution or a future aspiration for acclaimed singer Goapele — it’s a never-ending way of life.
“When I was first doing music, I wanted to sell 1,000 CDs, because that’s how many I could afford to press before we had a label,” she said with a laugh. “Then it was 2,000, and then I wanted to sell 100,000, and then the first album ended up selling a couple hundred thousand, so that felt like success. And then it was, ‘what’s the next thing?’”
Now, less than a year removed from the release of her sixth album Dreamseeker, “the next thing” keeps moving further down the road for Goapele. Instead of chasing the next big innovation, however, she used the project as an opportunity to return to her musical roots, minimizing live instrumentation to create what she calls an “effortless” album reminiscent of her debut Closer. 
Goapele has seen the full evolution of R&B in her 17-year career, a transformation she welcomes with open arms. Her discography has never been an exact fit into the box of R&B, but in an era where the borders between genres are crashing down, she finds it easier to create what she wants without having to struggle with labels. 
“I feel like we’ve come full circle, genre wise, with independent R&B music,” she said. “It’s something that I’ve been doing for a long time, but I felt like I had to explain myself, when I was first doing it. Now, it’s understood and established.” 
The fans themselves weren’t the ones Goapele felt she had to explain herself to — “they don’t care what it’s called; if they feel it, they feel it,” she said. But trying to convince the typical gatekeepers to promote her music was a struggle in the days when the walls were more rigid.
“I enjoy the songwriting aspect of what I do, and sometimes it doesn’t fit exactly in a genre,” she said. “In the studio that’s fine, but it can get challenging in terms of marketing, and radio, stuff like that. Sometimes it’s hard to get the exposure, that’s been more of a challenge than anything.”
The singer credits the initial years of her career she spent on her family label for not only instilling the extraordinary self-confidence necessary to succeed in her industry, but also giving her the tools to do it her own way. 
“I just focus on being authentic when I’m in the studio,” she said. “I came out on my family label, Skyblaze Recordings, and we partnered up with major labels even when I was on major, so I’ve always felt empowered to do the music that I wanted to do.”
Goapele’s family has empowered her in more ways than one; she is finely tuned into social issues of inequality and seeks to use her music as a fuel to spark the change she wishes to see. Her late South African father Douglas Mohlabane spent his life struggling against his country’s oppressive apartheid system, and in the process, opened his daughter’s eyes to the work that needed to be done.
“There’s always been a questioning of equality out there, and an awareness that just feels natural to me,” she said. “I’m a mom now, I have a daughter who’s confident and empowered; even though she’s really young, she’s already learning about sexism from comments people make at school. Things still aren’t balanced the way they should be.”
Mass incarceration and its disproportionate effects on people of color certainly qualifies another one of those imbalances, and Goapele points to her recent benefit concert with Common and J. Cole, which aimed to highlight this issue as an example of how she can use her platform to improve the bigger picture. Billed as the Imagine Justice concert in Sacramento, an estimated 30,000 people showed up for the free concert in front of the Capitol building, and left with a firsthand understanding of the power of music.
“We got them thinking about some of our policies, but it was a fun event, and that gives me life,” she said. “Being on stage and performing with the live musicians that I work with is exciting. When it’s live, it takes on its own life, and it’s always nerve wracking, it’s exciting.”
Goapele will be hitting the stage again on Saturday, this time at The Theatre at Ace Hotel. The event is presented by UCLA’s Center for the Art of Performance. Backed by live musicians in an intimate setting, the soulful singer is looking forward to traveling through her albums with the audience while creating a warm, comfortable atmosphere.
“Going through all five albums and different moods, it’s going to be a journey through my music,” she said. “It’s exciting to me that I finally have a long enough discography to dip and dive through all the albums, so it will definitely be dynamic.”

One of the best ways to celebrate Black History Month is by supporting black Americans and the art they create. There is a so much music, film, literature and art to recommend, but as black Americans have spawned some of the most revolutionary aspects of American culture since the country’s birth, it’s nearly impossible to narrow down recommendations of what to listen to, stream, read and view to celebrate Black History Month. Thus, the list below is focused more on the contemporary aspects of black culture and a few ways to support the activists and artists of today, while still paying respect to those of the past. 
Watch Mudbound on Netflix
It’s hard for black female directors to gain the same recognition their white counterparts are given. A perfect example of this is Dee Rees’ Mudbound, released on Netflix last January. The film was praised by critics, but received little recognition in the mainstream media, and was snubbed from most of the major categories at every awards show. It tells the chilling story of two World War II veterans, one black and one white, who return to their town in Mississippi and face the harsh realities of racism.
Watch 2 Dope Queens on HBO
Initially a podcast and now a series on HBO, 2 Dope Queens is a late-night stand-up show hosted by Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson. Aside from being incredibly funny, this show is one of the few, if any, late-night stand-up shows led by not one, but two black female comedians, which is extremely important in the field of comedy, where black female comedians still don’t receive as much attention or accolades as they deserve. New episodes air Friday nights at 11:30 p.m. on HBO.
Experience Black Panther in Theaters
Black Panther is imbued with black excellence. With an all-star cast and Ryan Coogler as the director, this film is poised to be one of the most stand-out Marvel releases of all time. The film, which is on track to be the biggest first quarter seller in the history of Fandango, is based off of the comic book by the same name. In the film, Black Panther (Prince T’Challa) is in line to become the king of Wakanda and must face the challenges of leading a nation. 
Buy black music 
February’s playlist should be about crossing genre lines and mixing the old with the new. Jam out to the iconic 1999 by the late Prince, which contains the legendary song “Little Red Corvette.” Meditate to Louis Armstrong’s classical jazz rendition of “La Vie en Rose” one night while staring at the stars. Dive deep into the genre of hip-hop and experience a few of the classics from artists such as Public Enemy, then listen to some contemporary hip-hop albums such as We Got It from Here… Thank You 4 Your Service by A Tribe Called Quest, their final studio album. 
Catch a “Window Seat” with poet Erykah Badu and appreciate works celebrating black womanhood, such as Lauryn Hill’s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which won Album of the Year at the Grammys and turned her into an international icon. As hip-hop is now the number one listened to genre in America, it’s impossible to turn on the radio and not hear its influence, but there’s plenty to learn from venturing deeper into black culture as well.
Follow black artists on Instagram
Social media has given black artists a new platform to rise and share their creative visions with the world. Some artists to check out include visual performance artist Oroma Elewa (@oroma.elewa), who just released a collective of short stories entitled “Crushed Guava Leaves,” and photographer and filmmaker Tyler Mitchell (@tylersphotos), whose work has appeared everywhere from Dazed Magazine to Vogue. Visual artist Gabrielle Richardson (@fridacashflow), perhaps best known as a curator for the “arthoecollective” — a platform created for young artists of color — is worth a follow. And the last artist that deserves follow consideration is contemporary artist Toyin Ojih Odutola (@toyinojihodutola), whose work can be seen in some of the biggest museums in the country, including the Museum of Contemporary Art here in Los Angeles.
Read The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas
This book tells an incredibly relevant story, and one which is about to be adapted into a movie on Fox. It looks at police brutality through the eyes of a young black girl named Starr, who witnesses the death of her friend at the hands of police.
Visit the California African American Museum 
There are many museums around Los Angeles dedicated to the black communities who have lived here. Visit the California African American Museum on Exposition Boulevard, where you can find the art, history and culture of black Americans through the western United States. One of its current exhibitions is entitled Adler Guerrier: Conditions and Forms for black Longevity, which is on view until Aug. 26.
And lastly, be aware
Keep up with activists like free agent Colin Kaepernick and the protests against the NFL, and follow activists like Deray McKesson on Twitter to stay informed about the issues black Americans are facing today. Finally, follow black journalists like Angela Jade Bastién, a writer for Vulture, and Zeba Blay, the senior culture critic for Huffington Post. Stay informed, support black artists and activists and then keep doing it, even after February ends.

Bonnie Wong | Daily Trojan
Indecision is my specialty, and second-guessing is one of my considerable crutches. Menus give me anxiety, too many options make me woozy and yes or no questions that require immediate answers spike my heart rate. I’ve been known to fill my notebooks with obsessively mapped out pro-con T-charts for every minor choice tossed my way (most recent entry: “Should I go out or stay at home on Friday?”). And yet, after everything is neatly laid out, there’s no telling if I have even reached a definitive conclusion. 
My word processor currently contains nine pages of varied, half finished prose pieces I’ve affectionately titled “Columnist Anthology.” Although I had numerous topics outlined and prewritten in neat typeface, I still struggled to choose a topic for this week. Last night I waffled between two pieces before reaching 99 percent certainty that I had finally settled on my choice. It was 3 a.m. and late into my fourth revision that I decided to completely scrap the entire thing and pull up another blank page. Apologies to my gracious editors. 
At this point you may have gathered that I’m a cautious overthinker prone to questioning the motivations behind my actions in preparation for my next move. In other words, you won’t find me making any spontaneous choices that aren’t scheduled in my planner at least two weeks in advance. I am by no means a risk taker, and I dread the mental push and pull that accompany decision making. I’ve always silently envied people who breeze through life, confidently making assertions left and right, wondering how they could be so certain of the outcome.

The summer before my sophomore year, I was required to make a difficult decision between continuing a friendship with a person who had emotionally manipulated me and guilt-tripped me into staying, or cutting that person off. In the subsequent months that followed, I personally felt responsible for the turmoil that had ensued, believing that the painful relationship was completely in my power. I spent too many late nights pinned down, taking the blame for the pain on both ends when in reality it had been a two-way street. In the end, I questioned whether or not I had made the right choice. 
If there’s one thing that’s for certain amid all the ambivalence, I’m undoubtedly appreciative that I am granted options in my day-to-day comings and goings, have endless selections at my disposal and am given the power of choice in spite of the circumstances. I also acknowledge that weighing the good against the bad in hopes that the better alternative will ultimately prevail is just a normal mechanism for people to get through life as functioning human beings. It’s not that I fear screwing up royally and being forced to endure insufferable consequences for my actions, but buried deep down is a panic that one wrong step will have me spiraling.
However, time and time again, being so acutely indecisive implies that I am preoccupied by the notion that my life trajectory is set so that everything is and must be under my control. Admittedly, this is a foolish thought because as much as I plot and plan, things rarely turn out in a similar fashion to the idealized version in my head. But maybe I’ve been missing the point all along. Maybe it’s liberating that I’m not always at the helm of my ship. At the end of the day, when I’m forced to commit to my intentions and silence the what-ifs brewing in my mind, then I’ll know rest assured that it’s time to move forward without looking back.

At first glance, Winchester seems to offer a fresh twist on the overdone horror genre. Released to audiences in the United States on Feb. 2, the film explores the story behind the Winchester Mystery House, and with a rich history of urban legends surrounding the cryptic mansion, brothers Michael and Peter Spierig had an interesting premise to work with in their film. Sarah Winchester (Helen Mirren), widow and heiress to the Winchester rifle fortune, constantly expands and renovates her home to both capture and communicate with the spirits of those murdered by the Winchester rifle. A local doctor, Eric Price (Jason Clarke), is tasked with evaluating Sarah’s mental health and fitness to hold majority stake of the Winchester company by living in the haunted home with her for a week. Throughout the week, Price begins seeing the spirits that reportedly haunt Winchester.
Starring Academy Award-winning actress Helen Mirren, the film’s great cast ostensibly offers a promising performance. Mirren’s believable acting delivers something frightening yet tasteful, as she explores the emotional conflict within her character and exquisitely portrays the enigmatic Sarah Winchester, pushing her acting limits. Though one might be surprised that Mirren explores an entirely new genre with her performance, in an interview with io9, she explained her choice to act in Winchester. 
“I don’t categorize this as a horror film,” she said. “I categorize it as a ghost story. I think there’s a real difference between the two. And I think ghost stories have had a long and rather noble history in filmmaking.”

Despite the intriguing concept and exciting casting, Winchester ultimately failed to escape the tropes so often associated with haunted house films. First, the directors rely on constant jump scares to try to build suspense throughout the film. Though it may come with the territory of the genre, the sheer amount within the film makes it ultimately predictable and unexciting. The movie also uses the trope of a creepy child to drive the plot forward through the nightly demonic possession of Henry, Winchester’s relative who lives in the home with her. Further embracing this trope are Henry’s creepy toys that make noise in hallways at night. From the vengeful spirit to the haunted basement, Winchester uses the cliches that saturate the horror genre.
Unfortunately, these horror movie cliches take away from the social impact of the film. Filled with a politically charged subtext about the role of guns in society, the movie tries to critique the human creation of a device designed primarily to kill. The message is subverted by the directors’ retreat into the comfort and ease provided by the stylistic elements of the haunted house template. This template, however, led to another dull and inconsequential horror movie.
Knowing that the film falls into this category of another cliche horror movie, it is still worth seeing in 4DX, the enhanced immersive cinematic experience. The moving seats of 4DX provide a weightless sense of unease as the camera pans over the mansion and throughout the creepy rooms, and the jump scares are made even more jarring and effective when the seat underneath you jolts at the same time. When the characters are shot on screen, viewers feel the bullets in the back of their seats. Finally, the climactic battles between the spirits and Winchester are made more dramatic through the lighting and motion effects from 4DX. 
In the end, the directing brothers failed to produce any consequential content. With such an interesting premise and the acting of stars like Helen Mirren, the Spierig brothers could have made a movie that actually delivered a message condemning gun use in our society, or bearing some other social impact message. Instead, they produced a “ghost story” that really fails to differentiate itself from any other movie in its haunted house, trope-filled genre. Yet, if audiences are still compelled to see it anyway, one’s best bet would be to sit back and enjoy the spectacle of action, rather than expect any insightful implications.

The trial and sentencing of Larry Nassar, a former sports physician who treated America’s top female gymnasts, was a rare moment of catharsis in the fight against sexual assault. Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct on Jan. 24 after over 150 women and girls recounted their harrowing stories of sexual abuse at his hand.

Although justice was served in the courtroom and the victims’ voices were heard, the Nassar case remains a reminder of the dark underbelly of elite athletics. USC, a school that prides itself on NCAA dominance and Olympic-level athletes, should remember the horrors that can be enabled by a competitive sports culture and take active steps to prevent them.
The most striking detail of the Nassar case is the sheer number of women who testified against him. Nassar began treating Team USA gymnasts in 1986 and Michigan State University gymnasts in 1997, and he worked at multiple youth gymnastics clubs as well. He was given unfettered access to adolescent athletes and, according to reports, passed off overtly sexual acts as legitimate medical treatments.
The first formal accusation of Nassar came in 1997. After another formal complaint in 2014, the university conducted an internal investigation of Nassar. He was cleared and continued to prey on young women in his practice. Later that year, the school failed to turn over its file on Nassar when the Department  of Education requested it in an unrelated Title IX investigation.
By 2016, when the Indianapolis Star began reporting on the issue, Ingham County officials said they had received about 50 complaints of sexual abuse over a 20 year period. With these allegations, why did multiple institutions allow him to continue seeing patients one-on-one?
It seems that Nassar’s monstrosity was enabled, or at least ignored, by a whole network of administrators, medical professionals and even parents.
It is possible that Nassar was simply a master manipulator and effectively hid this systematic abuse, but what seems more likely is that his associations with USA Gymnastics, multiple Olympic medalists and a nationally ranked collegiate team caused supervisors to turn a blind eye on misconduct.
Nassar is destined to spend the rest of his life in prison, but what punishment should be given to the bystanders and enablers at MSU and U.S.A. Gymnastics? Already, the president of the University has stepped down and so has the chairman of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation. The federal Department of Education has opened an investigation of Michigan State’s involvement, and the state’s legislators have demanded full transparency from the school.
As these investigations continue, we should expect more disturbing stories of the willful negligence that allowed Nassar to harm two decades’ worth of female athletes.
Abuse in sports, especially at the elite levels, is more prevalent than many care to consider.  A Washington Post report found more than 290 coaches and officials associated with U.S. Olympic teams have been accused of sexual misconduct in the last 36 years. Overtraining and psychological stress are common in elite sports, and young athletes can also be subjected to emotional manipulation, improper injury treatment and unreasonable expectations.
There is nothing wrong with athletes training to push the limits of human performance, but it must be acknowledged that disturbed, power-hungry adults can take advantage of this extreme athletic environment. The drive to achieve can easily cause athletes to push through physical and emotional pain, and abusers like Larry Nassar take advantage of that silence.
It is the responsibility of law enforcement, sports federations and schools to listen to athletes when they say they are being abused. Another win is not worth the price of an athlete’s mental or physical health. As much as we want to see Larry Nassar as an aberration, we have to work as a community to prevent actions like his.
Emotional, physical and sexual abuse are the extreme end point of an athletic culture that values winning over everything and sees the bodies of young athletes as pawns in the pursuit of medals and rankings. The sickening story of Larry Nassar may be the story of a monster, but it is also the story of dozens of administrators who overlooked the red flags waving in their faces, preferring to focus on the golden podium in the distance.

On Sunday, reality TV star and beauty mogul Kylie Jenner confirmed her widely speculated pregnancy and announced the birth of her daughter in a single tweet. In the statement Jenner shared on her social media channels, she wrote: “My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world. I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free and healthy way I knew how.”
In addition to her statement, Jenner posted an 11-minute video featuring an assortment of images, clips and narrations that she had curated over the past nine months and felt comfortable sharing with the world. The video told the story of her pregnancy up until she gave birth, and while not all of the details divulged in the video were particularly juicy, they were all connected by one common thread: Jenner had chosen to share them. Throughout all the months that have passed since pregnancy rumors first began to swirl in September, media and onlookers alike have all felt varying degrees of entitlement to knowledge about Jenner and her pregnancy. And in addition to this entitlement, The Cut writer Mariah Smith also pointed out the judgment and misogyny that underlay our collective assumptions about why Jenner chose to stay silent.
“We collectively assumed Kylie’s silence was rooted in shame, in her young age and even younger relationship with Travis Scott,” Mariah wrote. “But shame on us, because reality was far more beautiful. Proving that she’s more self-aware of her position in this world, and what her public image means, Kylie took time to focus on her real life.”
By retreating and taking time for herself away from the public eye, Jenner had the opportunity to reflect and prepare for the life-changing responsibilities of motherhood in ways that she simply would not have been able to otherwise. And in perceiving her decision to recuse herself from the media bubble that she’s spent most of her life in as a publicity stunt and act of shame, we not only inserted our own judgments and implicit, sexist bias into her narrative, but also played into the greater, overarching societal trend of denying women privacy in their bodily decisions.
Often, we discuss and analyze Jenner’s life from the lens of the profound privilege she was born into and continues to benefit from. In most circumstances, such as Jenner’s $70,000 budget on baby clothes for newborn daughter Stormi Webster, it’s important to keep her privilege in perspective. Plenty of 20-year-old women facing pregnancies would not have been able to consider raising a child as an option, or would have faced drastically different circumstances from Jenner upon giving birth. But privacy and complete decision-making power over one’s body and who gets to know about these decisions is not a privilege — it’s a right for all women.
And yet, across the country, this right remains challenged in myriad ways. In states like Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Rhode Island and others, laws either exist or have been seriously considered that would require women seeking abortions to obtain permission from the father of the fetus with few exceptions. Women could be forced to talk about their pregnancies and deeply personal reproductive health care decisions with men they may have no relationships with, men who may have abandoned them or even men who may have raped them. Thirty-seven states have laws requiring parental involvement or consent in a minor’s decision to have an abortion, also with few exceptions. As late as 2013, the Food and Drug Administration barred women younger than 17 years old from independently purchasing emergency contraception over the counter.
Last year, Oklahoma Rep. Justin Humphrey, the Republican lawmaker who proposed a partner consent law, justified his bill by saying that while “[women] feel like that is their body,” this isn’t the case because “you’re a host.” 
This particular quote by Humphrey exemplifies a common perception of abortion opponents that women lack ownership of their bodies. On top of this, the law he proposed implies that society, instead, has collective ownership of women’s bodies. Our laws and culture have created an environment in which the people in a woman’s life — or perhaps not in it — have not only the right to make her decisions, but also the right to know about them. 
In a society bent on shaming, discriminating against and punishing women for their personal bodily decisions, this matters. In many states, due to open-ended religious freedom laws, women can technically be fired, evicted or marginalized in other ways for having had abortions or for being sexually active. Research has shown that teenage girls are far more likely than teenage boys to face bullying and ostracism from their peers for being sexually active. It’s no exaggeration to say that the amount of privacy a woman has regarding her bodily and other personal decisions dictates her quality of life and the opportunities available to her.
Bodily autonomy is about more than the ability to choose to give birth or have an abortion without permission from partners, parents, the government or anyone else. It’s fundamentally about whether we can dictate who knows about these decisions, and how and when we want them to know.

Clay Helton and Co. will welcome 19 players, chock-full of talent to their 2018 recruiting class. Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Wednesday’s National Signing Day marked the end of the college football recruiting period, and USC went big. The Trojans started the day outside of the top 10 in overall recruiting rankings, but that would change in a matter of hours.
The first decision of the day came from linebacker Solomon Tuliaupupu at around 9:40 a.m. Tuliaupupu chose the Trojans over rivals UCLA and Notre Dame. The four-star product of Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif. is the fourth-ranked inside linebacker and 86th-ranked overall prospect in the nation according to 247sports.com. 
At 6 feet, 2 inches and 220 pounds, Tuliaupupu won the Butkus Award as the nation’s top linebacker for his senior season. He will join five-star high school teammates wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and quarterback JT Daniels as Trojans next season.
The second and possibly most important commitment came from five-star cornerback Olaijah Griffin at around 10:30 a.m. The 6-foot, 170-pound prospect out of Mission Viejo High School established himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the class of 2018, earning his spot as 247Sports’ third-ranked corner and 28th-ranked player at any position. Griffin was picking between USC, Tennessee, Alabama and Oregon. 
Griffin, the son of rapper Warren G, announced his decision on ESPN and celebrated with legendary USC linebacker Willie McGinest, his famous father and Snoop Dogg. As an instinctive and physical player, any production he gives as a freshman will be a massive gain for a Trojan defensive backfield that struggled mightily at times in 2017.
The Trojans continued their hot streak when four-star wide receiver Devon Williams picked USC over Oregon on ESPN. At 6 feet, 4 inches and 200 pounds, Williams is highly gifted, listed by ESPN as the number one athlete in his class. The product of Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, Calif. Williams is the sixth-ranked wide receiver and 40th-ranked player in 2018.
USC’s luck ended when four-star receiver/tight end Michael Ezeike chose UCLA around 1:30 p.m., and this continued when four-star offensive lineman Penei Sewell committed to Oregon 30 minutes later. Sewell’s decision was a particularly tough pill to swallow, as USC’s 24-7 Cotton Bowl loss to Ohio State proved the team needs to improve in the trenches.
However, the Trojans finished the day strong when four-star cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart committed to USC over Tennessee, Alabama and Texas A&M. The 6-foot-2-inch, 187-pound defensive back out of Helix Charter High School in San Diego made the announcement that he would be staying in Southern California via a livestream on his Instagram account. The additions of Taylor-Stuart and Griffin, both top-five cornerbacks according to 247Sports, set the Trojans up for a future of lockdown production on the outside.
The Trojans also added a few preferred walk-ons. Two-star receiver Zach Wilson of Saguaro High School in Scottsdale, AZ, tweeted his commitment around 9:10 a.m. Twenty-five minutes later, safety Jordan McMillan of Loyola High School tweeted he would be living out his dream and joining USC.
Four players who had previously committed to USC signed their letters of intent on Wednesday. Along with St. Brown and Daniels, four-star linebacker Eli’jah Winston and four-star defensive lineman Trevor Trout confirmed that they will be Trojans next season. Winston tweeted his decision to flip from Oregon to USC on Tuesday, while Trout announced his commitment back in November.
Including early signees from December, the Trojans’ current 2018 recruiting class includes 18 players, two of whom are preferred walk-ons. Head coach Clay Helton will have a lot of talent to work with from this group, especially with multiple big names at linebacker, receiver and cornerback. USC finishes with six recruits ranked in the top 40 of the 247Sports composite. In addition, the Trojans earned the commitments of 247Sports’ top four California prospects, five of the top six and seven of the top 11.
 USC jumped to fourth in 247Sports’ team recruiting rankings, finishing with four five-stars players, 13 four-stars and one three-star. Tied with Georgia for the second-best average rating per recruit, USC can expect great things from a stacked class in the future.

The USC women’s lacrosse team is set to kick off their season on Saturday at Virginia Tech. 
Sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller scored the fifth-most goals last season. Daily Trojan file photo.
This Women of Troy team will play in the inaugural season of Pac-12 women’s lacrosse. Women’s lacrosse has become the 13th sport sponsored by the Pac-12. 
The Trojans earned conference championship titles the past two seasons, winning the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and advancing to the NCAA quarter final both years. Last season they finished with a record of 18-4. 
Coming into the 2018 season, expectations are high. The Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association released their top-25 poll at the end of last month, ranking the Trojans No. 8, leaving the team with the challenge to  move into the top 5 as the season progresses. Among their Pac-12 competitors, Colorado (17) and Stanford (23) have also earned spots on the rankings. 
For the inaugural season of Pac-12 women’s lacrosse, USC has been voted to take the regular-season title by the other head coaches in the conference. They will continue to rely on their previously successful team and look to improve with the addition of freshmen. 
They will be led by head coach Lindsey Munday, who earned her 69th career win last season. Sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller will continue her strong presence on the team, after winning MPSF’s Rookie of the Year award last season. Senior Lydia Sutton comes into this season after being named an IWLCA third-team All-American.
Freshman goalie Riley Hertford and midfielder Kelsey Huff ranked 12 and 13 in the Power 100 freshman rankings, respectively, are expected to bring the experience of their successful high school careers as Under Armour High School All-Americans to enhance the team’s dynamic. They have both been named to the ILWomen Power 100 Freshman Rankings by InsideLacrosse.com. 
Virginia Tech attackers Tristan McGinley and Emma Harden will be an offensive force, while defenseman Kelly Glatthorn and goalie Meagh Graham will lead the team defensively. They will also be relying on the presence of their 13 incoming freshman, who will act as the foundation as the Hokies build their women’s lacrosse program.
The Trojans will continue on the road for their first few games following the season opener, as they play No. 2 Stony Brook in the Orange County Lacrosse Showcase. Later in the month, they will travel to No. 15 Notre Dame and No. 9 Northwestern before the first home game on March 7, where they will face No. 6 Boston College. The Women of Troy will begin Pac-12 play soon after that, as they take on Arizona State at home on March 10.

Freshman Paige Hauschild is not one to brag.
Freshman two-meter woman Paige Hauschild has begun to settle into her position on the defense for the Women of Troy. Photo from USC Athletics.
At the age of 19, she’s already proven herself in the pool — 8 goals in her first three collegiate matches, MPSF awards in her first week as a Trojan and a spot on the U.S. national senior team roster. But ask her about her success, and Hauschild will brush it off, crediting it all to hard work and her teammates’ support.
“My teammates are definitely my favorite part of the game,” Hauschild said. “Playing a team sport has always been something that’s really big for me. We play for the team, we win as a team. It’s what’s always been.”
She’s not the tallest girl on the team, but her teammates say she’s certainly the strongest, and the fastest, too. Junior goalkeeper Amanda Longan calls her refreshing, hard working, a necessary addition to a team looking to win a championship. Senior Brianna Daboub, her captain and team big sister, describes her in one word : beast.
“She’s got really good water polo IQ,” Daboub said. “She understands the game well, she reads the game well and that makes for a great water polo player.”
That IQ is central to why Hauschild is taking over the center defending position. The two-meter slot used to belong to Brigitta Games, Hauschild’s teammate from the U.S. national team who dominated the two-meter slot for the Trojans for three years. 
But Games graduated last year, leaving a hole in one of the most vital parts of the USC roster. Even as the youngest starter on the team, Hauschild is the best pick to fill it.
The center position in water polo is similar to the same position in basketball. On offense, five players form an arc around the goal, while the center — typically the strongest and largest athlete on a team — positions themselves two meters away from the goal. 
In this spot, the center attempts to use their body to gain an inside edge on the goalkeeper. To defend this position, Hauschild has to be both strong enough to wrestle an opponent while possessing the speed and endurance to race back on a counterattack. Hauschild isn’t as big as many centers, so she uses her length and strength to keep her opponent off balance. 
It’s a brutal position, she admits, but it’s worth it.
“It’s hard at first to learn any system or any new technique,” Hauschild said. “But I’ve said it from the beginning, I’m here to fill any role that my team needs. Whatever they need from me, that’s what I’m gonna do.”
For Hauschild, being one of the youngest kids in the pool is the norm. She earned her first spot on the U.S. national team at the age of 15, becoming the youngest name on the roster of a water polo team preparing for the Olympic Games. At the time, it was a transitional position — she played mainly for the youth development team while occasionally training with the senior team. Since then, she’s become used to competing with girls who are older, stronger and more experienced than her. 
Those first practices were eye-opening for Hauschild. Despite her humble nature, she was aware of her own skill and speed in the pool. But international play was different — her teammates were taller and stronger, with an intensity and attention to detail that she had never seen before in the pool. It was a fight to keep up.
By last year, however, she became a full-time fixture of the senior team, spending most of her summer on the road with the squad at tournaments in China and Hungary. The final stop was the FINA World Championships, an annual international competition hosted in Budapest.
In Budapest, water polo was different. The streets closed for the opening ceremonies, where CeeLo Green performed in front of swarms of fans. The team took a boat to an island, where tens of thousands of spectators packed the stands. 
Hauschild notched her first two national team goals in the opening game against South Africa, a feat that went relatively unnoticed in a dominant 24-2 victory for the Americans. But for a young athlete, the goal meant more — it was a sign that she could hold her own.
“It was just a minor thing for most people because we were all scoring goals,” Hauschild said. “But I was excited on the inside. Everyone else acted cool, like this was what we were supposed to do, but it was a big moment for me, so I was excited but I was trying to keep it cool.”
As the tournament went on, Hauschild spent less time in the pool, but she soaked in the foreign experience of playing for a raucous crowd. Most water polo players are used to small crowds — dozens of fans at high school games, perhaps a couple hundred at a college championship. The opposite was true in Hungary, where water polo is a top sport and typically draws vocal and passionate masses. The final game — which the USA won in a 13-6 victory over the host country — was Hauschild’s favorite memory with the sport.
“It was kind of surreal,” Hauschild said. “I didn’t even think that many people would come for a water polo game. There’s nothing like a crowd like that and an atmosphere like that. It was surreal.”
Hauschild carried that national team experience into her freshman year of college, and the experience quickly showed. She notched a hat trick in her first game, earning MPSF Newcomer of the Week honors after her debut. Since that opening game, she’s scored eight times, including a 4-goal stunner in the Trojans’ shutout against Cal Baptist.
With some young players, this level of early success could be a challenge to combat, with coaches and veterans alike fighting to restrain an inflated ego or overconfidence. But that’s simply not the case for Hauschild, who credited the success to her teammates — for setting her up, for spreading the ball, for believing in her ability.
“It’s really not a problem,” Daboub said. “If you didn’t know her resume, you wouldn’t know just how good she is when you’re out of the pool. She’s got a good head on her shoulders.”
For Hauschild, those early games created confidence, something to build on. 
Despite being an international player, she admitted that she entered the season a little meek, eager to pass and hesitant to shoot. Now, as one of the leaders both on the stat sheet and in the pool, she’s feeling herself come into her element.
“When I first showed up, I was a freshman so I would kind of shy away from some risks,” Hauschild said. “But it’s become very clear that the whole team wants me to be finisher on the team and to be aggressive, so that’s what I’m going to do. I think we’re just getting warmed up now, and it’s really exciting.”

After practice one day before the season began, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin talked about the heightened expectations that came with being ranked the preseason No. 10 team in the country.
“We’re not going to be ranked No. 10 and blow it all away,” McLaughlin said.
With seven games left in the regular season schedule, the jury is still out on pretty much everything for USC men’s basketball. A season that began with its hype train at full speed ground to a halt with three straight nonconference losses, a defeat to Princeton and then a lackluster Pac-12 opener against Washington.
But then the Trojans caught fire, winning eight of their next nine games, their only loss coming on a halfcourt buzzer beater by Stanford. They beat Colorado, Utah and Cal by double digits. They pulled off close wins over Oregon and Oregon State, and then redeemed themselves against Stanford. And they took a huge step toward solidifying their NCAA Tournament bid.
Still, there is work to do. USC lost to UCLA last Saturday in a game they should’ve won, if not for immaturity on the part of sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic and poor late-game execution. With or without De’Anthony Melton, it is clear at this point that the Trojans are not as strong as the No. 10 ranking they were handed preseason.
They can, however, do their best not to “blow it all away.” Right now, the best case scenario for this team would be to make the NCAA Tournament for the third straight season, and go from there. Expectations can shift over the course of the season, and considering the start to this year, simply making the tournament would be a win. To do that, USC must get through this pivotal weekend ahead against the Arizona schools in the desert.
On Thursday, the Trojans will play an upstart Arizona State program that has faded in Pac-12 play but burst onto the scene early in the season with several impressive wins. On Saturday, they face No. 13 Arizona, the Pac-12 favorite.
These two games, combined with last Saturday’s loss to UCLA, constitute perhaps the most important stretch of USC’s remaining schedule. The Sun Devils may be faltering in conference play, but still sport the most dynamic offense the Trojans will see this season. They lead the Pac-12 in scoring offense, while the Wildcats, after a poor start, have won 16 of 18 games, lead the Pac-12 in field goal percentage and 3-point field goal percentage and have emerged once again as a Final Four hopeful. 
History does not bode well for USC on this road trip. The Trojans have been swept on their last five sojourns to the desert and seven of the last eight years. The last time they beat both Arizona teams in the same season was in 1985. 
This history underscores just how big these two games are. At the very least, USC needs a split — and if it can’t pull the upset at Arizona, at least make it a close game. Because if the Trojans lose both games, there are few opportunities left to climb back up in the tournament picture.
Heading into Thursday, the Trojans rank 45th in RPI. That should be good enough to qualify for the tournament — both ESPN and CBS currently project USC as an 11th seed. Both opponents this weekend rank ahead of USC in RPI — Arizona State is 44th, Arizona is 16th. 
After these two games, the Trojans won’t have a chance to really build on their resume. Their only big test will be the season finale against UCLA, which is 56th in RPI. Otherwise, games against Oregon, Oregon State, Colorado and Utah won’t move the needle.
USC has been through a lot this season — the preseason hype, the early struggles, the injury bug that has hit star junior forward Bennie Boatwright again. And, of course, the ongoing FBI investigation that led to the firing of assistant coach Tony Bland and the absence of Melton all season has lingered in the back of everyone’s minds.
Perhaps this team, which some thought would be a sleeper to make the Final Four, won’t be the one that brings USC hoops back to glory. The Trojans won’t fully live up to their No. 10 preseason ranking. But they can’t blow it all away, and a couple of wins this weekend would go a long ways toward avoiding that.
