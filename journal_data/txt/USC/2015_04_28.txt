LavaLab hosted its semesterly Demo Night at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Tuesday night.
LavaLab is a student-run organization in which students from engineering, business and design backgrounds form teams to build products throughout the semester. Demo Night is the culmination of that process. Each team had a table where they were able to show off their prototypes.
There were a total of eight start-ups present. These included Docket, an app that forces users into choosing an event out of many; Utique, an app that chooses clothes in online stores based on a user’s personality; Voya, an app that captures all the great spots in a city to look at after a trip is over; Zap, an app that allows people to dare friends to do specific challenges that they must later prove with photo evidence; Cache, an app that saves users’ money in advance so that they can painlessly purchase items; Augment Analytics, a service that provides event companies and concert organizers with the demographic information of their attendees; Icepick, a dating app that sends users on carefully evaluated blind dates; and Jam Jar, a music-sharing app that gathers music from various streaming platforms.
The event was packed with students, start-up scouts and visitors. Aneesha Gupta, LavaLab’s director of operations, explained that LavaLab’s popularity has affected its application process.
“It is pretty intense,” Gupta said. “You submit a written application, and then come in for a personal interview where we get to know you, your background and your skill set. Then we have a group interview where we make sure that you have really good teamwork, problem-solving and leadership capabilities.”
Gupta explained that during the group interview, applicants are given problems to solve. Last semester the issue was: “Your restaurant is running low on expenditures. How can you solve that problem?”
“It’s always a very open-ended question on purpose to see how students can build a product to solve that problem,” Gupta said. “We see how applicants work in a team in that 45-minute block.”
Gupta then delineated LavaLab’s methodology, saying that the program is built around connecting creative students.
“A lot of people here at USC are really interested in building and creating, but they don’t have a team and they don’t necessarily have an idea,” Gupta said. “We put students in this incubated program where they can meet people and come up with a problem and a product together. You don’t come in with an idea. You come up with one once you meet your team in the first day of LavaLab.”
Gupta said LavaLab has a full 10-week curriculum. In addition, it has plenty of workshops to facilitate the product development process, such as ideation, UX, design and pitch workshops. LavaLab also invites guest speakers, such as pitch coach extraordinaire John Bates.
“We build our curriculum so that our workshops are aligned with the stages the teams are in,” Gupta said.
Gupta said one of last semester’s most successful projects was Hexcare, a data analytics web platform that takes in data from wearables. This allows patients to share data with their doctors in real-time.
“This semester we also have a lot of cool products,” Gupta said. “One of them is called Utique, which is a fashion platform. It’s a web service that takes online shopping data, such as clothes from Macys and Bloomingdales and JCrew, and puts it into one database. It learns your style and curates clothes for you based on your style and personality. It is your own curated boutique.”
When asked about the importance of LavaLab, Gupta highlighted its uniqueness in the entrepreneurial world at USC.
“Students who are interested in the start-up scene, or even just interested in building products, don’t have a lot of places to go where they can meet people and come up with an idea together,” Gupta said. “If you don’t have a starting point, there aren’t many options besides LavaLab.”
LavaLab, founded in fall 2013, is only in its second year of existence. Gupta explained that before, members met in a small classroom and didn’t get much attention. Now the organization has gained traction through its curriculum and recruitment of talent.
“It’s been pretty amazing to watch LavaLab grow tremendously,” Gupta said. “It’s an ongoing process. LavaLab is a start-up in itself and it’s been pretty great to have been a part of it.”

For the past four years, the student-run organization Swipes for the Homeless has been a fixture on campus for collecting unused meal swipes and discretionary funds.
This semester, however, the organization has refocused its mission and adopted a new title to reflect its broadened vision: Swipe Out Hunger.
During the last two weeks of each semester, members of Swipe Out Hunger set up a table outside of dining halls and dormitories to invite students to donate their unused meal swipes by providing their name, student ID number, meal plan option and signature. Students are also able to donate using the Tapingo app and selecting the Swipes option on the menu. When students sign up to donate, they are given information on local hunger and homelessness.
Each year, the funds raised through the program are donated to local nonprofits. Last semester, the USC chapter collaborated with USC Hospitality to contribute its funds to Los Angeles Mission, a local homeless shelter and recovery program.
“It’s so easy to get wrapped up in the USC community when the farthest place you go to is The Row … but there’s so much going on outside of USC. We can’t forget that we live in the homelessness capital of the nation. We need to be more aware of our surroundings,” said Nana Sarkodee-Adoo, president of USC’s Swipe Out Hunger chapter.
According to representatives from Swipes’s national organizers, the recent name change stemmed “from a desire to operate closer to our core values of empowering students into action, ending hunger and having the Swipes brand better inform our actions in the world.”
Individual campus chapters were given the choice to keep the organization’s founding name or adopt the new title.
Students can continue to spend dining dollars after they sign up for the Swipes program; the remaining balance is contributed to the program.
“I participate in Swipes because I like having the opportunity to be an on-campus advocate for homeless individuals and the struggles they are facing, which includes hunger, but also issues such as housing, finding jobs or receiving medial treatment,” said Thalia Henderson, a junior majoring in creative writing and social sciences.
Swipe Out Hunger, founded in 2009 by UCLA alum Rachel Sumekh, now has chapters at 13 colleges nationwide including UCLA, USC, Pepperdine, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara and San Diego State.
In the spring of last year, Sarkodee-Adoo served as Swipes campaign director, and this fall, she served as vice president.
This semester, the USC Swipes chapter planned volunteer events at Midnight Mission, a non-profit on Skid Row that serves meals to the homeless three times a day. In the fall, Swipes partnered with the Delta Delta Delta Sorority and Ground Zero to hold a canned food drive.
The USC Chapter has six executive board members, including two individuals who joined the board last week.
Last Wednesday, the organization made blankets for the Downtown Women’s Center, and soon the members will visit the shelter to donate them.
“To be honest, leading the organization has been an interesting experience. It’s definitely hard at times when you’re at an event, and you don’t have enough volunteers or if you can’t convince students to go to a shelter and serve meals on a Friday night. But it’s always inspiring to see our numbers at the end of the semester. Last semester, we raised over $20,000,” said Sarkodee-Adoo, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning & development.
In the coming year, Sarkodee-Adoo hopes to broaden the organization’s scope and transition from being active just at the end of the year to providing programming all semester. Next semester, the chapter plans to hold a service event at the end of each month and coordinate transportation to the events to improve student participation.
Sarkodee-Adoo said that she appreciates Swipes because it provides a direct donation process for students.
“I’ve always had the desire to help people. Swipes is just a different way of helping people because it creates a way for students to directly donate to the cause. I really like it because it stands out. It’s not something that everyone else does. It’s really unique to our organization,” Sarkodee-Adoo said.

This article has nothing to do with USC sports. For my last column of the year, I will be going on a completely personal tangent. But if you enjoyed any of the other articles I’ve written in my Daily Trojan career, then bear with me for just a bit.
When I look back on my journalism career thus far, there is one question I still struggle to answer: why did my friends and I care so much about our high school newspaper?
I didn’t get paid $15 every time I signed up for an article like I do now. I knew early on in my junior year that I had no intention of ever being the editor in chief of the paper. The one journalism convention we really cared about was always in November, leaving the rest of the year without anything vaguely competitive for seniors to care about.
Yet from my first week on staff as a sophomore until the day I graduated, I devoted myself to the Harvard–Westlake Chronicle.
There’s only one person who really knows why. It’s not God, but she almost is one in the high school journalism world.
I remember being vaguely intimidated by Mrs. Neumeyer before I even met her. The adviser to our middle school magazine warned that she was pretty intense, and older students said if I wanted to be on the Chronicle staff, I would have to sell my soul to her.  But I wasn’t deterred; I knew I wanted to be on staff before I even got to the school.
Sure enough, she rejected the first article I ever submitted to her — a news brief that should have been a feature.
The Harvard–Westlake Chronicle was no joke. We published a 36-page issue every month — 12 pages devoted to the news, four pages of opinion, a 12-page features section and eight pages dedicated just to sports. We published the first issue of the year during the last week of summer and we published the last issue of the year Memorial Day weekend. We also ran a website, published the alumni magazine and put out a sports magazine.
Putting out all that content took a lot of work. The Chronicle staff would meet together once a day during school like a normal class, then spend pretty much an entire weekend working on layout once a month. We would finish editing each issue on Monday nights and the paper would come out on Wednesdays. Those Monday night layout sessions would start right after school and usually last until 11 p.m., when the computer system at school automatically shut down. To this day, I still don’t know if that procedure was IT policy to save energy or was really just meant to prevent us from working on the paper until first period at 8 a.m. the next day. The alumni and sports magazine required additional after-school days to edit. The website required constant updating and even stayed current during summer break. If there was ever a performance, event or sports competition on campus, you could bet that a reporter was there to cover it with a camera.
And we were good. The expectation every year was to win something from the National Scholastic Press Association, the California Newspaper Publishers Association of and the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. At the NSPA convention my senior year, the Chronicle was named the second best paper in show, the website was named best in show and the sports magazine was named fourth best specialty publication in show.
I was very drawn to the sports section of the Chronicle. The dream job was always to be a sportscaster or sportswriter, almost as early as it was to be a professional athlete. I wanted to be on ESPN or write for Sports Illustrated one day, but I knew that just about every guy between 15 and 45 wanted to, too. If I were to ever legitimately get that chance, I would need some big breaks.
The Chronicle sports section was my big break. It was my head start, my chance to prove that I really could be a good sports journalist if given the opportunity. Not only was the athletic program at our school that we covered one of the best in Southern California, but the resources we had to cover it were unheard of for a high school.
We had $1,000 cameras at our disposal to take high-resolution photos and videos for our print and digital edition. We had eight whole pages in the paper devoted to sports, which I would guess is the size of most schools’ entire papers. We had our own student-run sports magazine, our own Sports Illustrated — something USC doesn’t even have.
But most importantly, we had the best adviser in the country.
Mrs. Neumeyer had quite the career in journalism before teaching it. She was grossly overqualified to be teaching high school journalism; my experience with the Chronicle has rivaled all that I have learned here at Annenberg.
She was a graduate of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. She covered the Manson murder trials for United Press International. She wrote gripping features on some of the first patients to ever be diagnosed with HIV. She had covered state politics in California since the first time Jerry Brown was governor in the 1975. She interviewed shop owners, church leaders and other common citizens who played big parts in the cleanup effort after the Rodney King riots.
Yet in 1992, the same year as the Rodney King riots, Mrs. Neumeyer was hired by Harvard-Westlake to advise the school newspaper. Since then, she’s won more national distinctions than Michael Phelps has gold medals; she’s had several graduates enter the journalism profession, and she’s played a key role in the education experience of a hundreds of students who have ever been on her staff.
Most staffers didn’t apply to journalism school like I did. But in the private prep-school, a top position on the school newspaper was a great resume addition. In fact, the experience for many juniors on staff could aptly be described as a rat race to see who becomes EIC, and there was always some tension at our end of the year staff party, just before Mrs. Neumeyer emailed out the upcoming year’s staff list.
Yet senior year was when we cared the most about the publication, even without the major ulterior motive of resume padding.  Sure, there were a couple of people who mentally checked out to some degree after not getting the position they wanted, but by the first week of school no one cared about that drama anymore. There was a huge sense of pride in the paper and a huge sense of ownership by the senior class. We wrote almost as many stories as we delegated, we fretted over meticulous details that really nobody but us would have noticed and we stayed until 11 p.m. every Monday night layout session, often getting dinner together afterward at the nearby diner and getting home around 1 a.m.
So why did we care so much? Why did we solemnly swear to publish four 32-page issues of the sports magazine, even if it meant coming in over spring break or giving up valuable second semester senior time?  Why did we redesign entire sections on Sunday nights because they just didn’t look good enough?
I still don’t exactly know why, but Mrs. Neumeyer made us care. We all bought into the standard of excellence she set, and she stayed with us until we finished every issue. She drilled into us an amazing attention for detail — especially for Oxford commas, a cardinal sin in AP style — but she simultaneously didn’t micromanage. She let us make the decisions, and that’s what created that sense of ownership. Sure, there were plenty of mistakes, but she knew the whole point was for us to learn from them.
Most importantly though, she made us care about each other. Some of my best friends were on that staff, and we knew our finished product represented all of us. I honestly don’t think I’d be at Annenberg, and maybe not even ’SC, if it wasn’t for her, but I’m most grateful for the relationships she helped foster in school.
After 23 school years at H-W, Mrs. Neumeyer is retiring this June. On behalf of every other student that ever worked for you, wrote for you or took a picture for you, thank you.
Luke Holthouse is a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development, and broadcast and digital journalism. His column “Holthouse Party,” ran on Wednesdays.
Kathy
was a phenomenal teacher, and we were incredibly fortunate to have her. Though I didn’t end up going into journalism professionally, I’m profoundly grateful for the work ethic, creativity, and writing ability that Kathy helped to instill in me. I try to bring those skills to my work in the education sector every day.
I only wish that schools that are not as privileged as Harvard-Westlake could also hire instructors with as much talent as Kathy has. Students throughout Los Angeles deserve the kind of experience that we so often took for granted.

USC senior setter Micah Christenson is the co-winner of the Lloyd Ball Award presented by Off The Block, it was announced Monday. The award is given to the nation’s top setter in men’s Division I and II volleyball during the regular season.
Christenson tied for the award with fellow All-American senior, Pepperdine’s Matt West. The tie is the closest finish the award has ever had.
Both Christenson and West finished with 65 votes.  Christenson had received 16 first-place votes, while West finished the voting with 13 first-place votes.  The voters consist of upwards of 30 coaches and reporters from around the nation.
He now has back-to-back awards, being that he was the outright winner of the award last season.
The setter ended the regular season with impressive statistics, including leading the MPSF in average aces per game with .43.
Christenson is already regarded as one of the top setters in the world, and his performance this season has only cemented that assertion. USC is averaging almost two more assists per set than their opponents, and they have a .430 assist percentage, which is nearly 40 percent higher than their opponents.
Christenson ended the regular season averaging 10.59 assists per game, good enough for seventh in the nation.
Christenson’s accolades do not stop in this nation, though. Christenson has been playing for Team USA since 2009 when he became the youngest setter to play for the United States in a world championship.
Since then, Christenson’s international prowess has grown. He debuted with the men’s national team in 2013 at the NORCECA Continental Championship, a tournament in which he was named both best server and best setter in addition to being named an All-Star.
More recently, Christenson represented the red, white and blue in the summer of 2014 in the FIVB World League.  Christenson’s impressive role as the primary setter for the squad was amplified by the fact that he was the only collegiate player on the roster.  Christenson led the squad to its first gold medal in the league since 2008, and it was only the second gold medal for the team in history.
He then went on to set during the four-match USA volleyball cup in which the USA faced Iran.
Christenson forewent an enticing professional career and returned to finish his senior year at USC.  Following his graduation, the native Hawaiian will likely pursue Olympic aspirations with Team USA for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
“I do think that I’m ready to play for a team overseas after my university career is over this year,” Christenson said in an interview with World of Volley on New Year’s Eve.  “Being able to have the international experience of playing with the USA team has helped me prepare for playing professionally overseas and I am excited for that next step in my career.”
Before he takes on the world, however, Christenson will make one last stand with USC as they visit UC Irvine Thursday night in the second round of the MPSF Tournament.  The team will then focus on the upcoming NCAA tournament.

USC was unable to maintain an early lead against Cal State Fullerton during last night’s game, falling 5-3 in the 12th inning following a disappointing showing from the Trojan bullpen.
After a quick top of the first from sophomore starter Bernardo Flores, the Trojans threatened an early lead as starting Titans pitcher Miles Chambers walked the first two batters. After a sacrifice bunt from Jeremy Martinez put two men in scoring position, the Trojans were unable to bring any runners home.
Chambers got back into his groove after a shaking top of the first. The Trojans struggled to string hits together, stranding runners in scoring position during the second and third innings.
Things started to get interesting during the bottom of the fourth inning. After junior David Oppenheim hit a deep fly out to right followed by a soft groundout from freshman Aldaberto Carrillo, junior AJ Ramirez hit a solo homerun out to left field to put the Trojans on the board.
After a 1-2-3 top of the fifth from Flores, the Trojan offense started to heat up in part thanks to a costly error from the Titans’ third basemen. With two down, Martinez hit a rocket up the middle, sliding into second on a close call for the double. Junior Timmy Robinson then hit a grounder to left for what would be a routine out at first to end the Trojan threat, but he instead made a poor throw to first. Martinez was then able to score from second, and Robinson made it to second on the error, putting the Trojans up 2-0.
Senior Dante Flores came up next for the Trojans. After battling Titans’ reliever Connor Seabold to a 3-2 count, CSFU head coach Rick Vanderhook was thrown out of the game by home plate umpire Joe Malden due to his strongly worded calls from the Titans dug out. Vanderhook had previously come on to the field during the fifth inning to debate the umpire’s call when CSFU outfielder Tyler Steib struck out looking.
USC continued the offensive pressure in the sixth starting with a lead-off double down the third base line by junior David Oppenheim. Facing Carrillo, Seabold committed a costly balk, advancing Oppenheim to third with no outs. After Carrillo grounded out to make the first out, Ramirez stepped up to deliver a key sacrifice bunt, bringing Oppenheim home and putting to the Trojans up 3-0.
CSFU came charging back during the top of the seventh to threaten the Trojans’ lead. After allowing a single up center to put a man on with one out, Flores exited the game after delivering five and one-third innings of shut out baseball.
Junior reliever Brooks Kriske entered the game to face sophomore Timmy Richards, who singled down the first base line to put runners on the corners with one out. Steib then singled to bring home a run, making the score 3-1 with runners on first in second, one out.
After making another out and forcing Titans’ Taylor Bryant into a 0-2 count, Kriske allowed another single, bringing home a second run and once again putting runners at the corners, making the score 3-2 Trojans.
Kriske’s night ended as junior Kyle David entered the game to make the final out and end the Titans’ threat.
The Trojans answered right back in the bottom of the seventh to eventually load the bases, though they were unable to put any more runs up on the board. Seabold walked Stahel to lead off the inning before William Kuhl replaced Seabold with one out and one man on. Kuhl then walked Martinez, putting two on with one down.
Robinson subsequently sliced one into left to load the bases with one out. This ended Kuhl’s night and brought in Tyler Peitzmeier. Flores then hit a grounder directly to first, making the double play at first and then at home to prevent the Trojans from managing further runs.
The Titans continued their late in the game comeback during the top of the eighth. After two singles putting men on first and second with one, Bravo hit a soft grounder to third that Carrillo gloved then threw to first get Bravo out. Ramirez’ subsequent throw to home, however, arrived too late as Josh Vargas slid into home, tying the score 3-3.
The top of the ninth almost proved to be fatal for the Trojans as the Titans threatened to bring the winning run home. Marc Huberman started off the inning by allowing a lead off single followed by a walk, putting two men on with one out. A sac-bunt advanced the runners still with one out.
Huberman then intentionally walked Dustin Vaught to load the bases and bring up Josh Vargas. Vargas hit a soft grounder to the mound to be thrown to Trojan second baseman Dante Flores, who made the out at second.
Though the first base umpire called Vargas safe at first, allowing the runner at third to get to home, the third baseman umpire called runner’s interference against Vaught, nulling the run and relieving the Trojans of the run that would’ve cost them the game.
CSFU continued their momentum into the top of the ninth inning as Peitzmeier delivered a 1-2-3 inning to force the game into extra innings.
Following an uneventful 10th inning, both teams threatened to bring home the winning run in the 11th but came up short. CSFU loaded to bases with two outs, but Huberman managed to cause a pop up to prevent any damage.
The Trojans then made things interesting but couldn’t produce a run after Ramirez advanced to first after being hit by a pitch, subsequently stealing second, then third following a wild pitch with two outs. The Titans walked Stahel to put runners on the corner, bringing up Stubbs, who hit a grounder to end the inning.
CSFU got hot in the top of the 12th to put the two key runs on the board, giving them a 5-3 advantage on the Trojans. A   lead-off single followed by a stolen base put a runner at second, and then at third after a sac bunt. Shortstop Timmy Richards then singled up the middle, bringing home a run and pushing the Titans ahead 4-3.
Richards subsequently stole second, followed by Huberman walking a player to put two men on with two outs. A wild pitch from Huberman allowed Richards to reach home from second, bringing home the final run of the game, 5-3 Titans.
Coach Hubbs has a way to ruin a pitching staff. What reason would you let your best reliever keep pitching all those innings
when he is needed more for the conference weekend series? Using Kyle Davis ( not David ) who can’t get anyone out in recent
games in clutch situations not very assuring. Team blew way too many scoring chances throughout the game. This weekend
series with lowly Utah will show if Trojans can regain some steam or doing a late season collapse.

The Black Student Assembly presented the Mahogany Awards, an annual awards ceremony for the black community at USC to highlight students, member organizations and USC staff, Tuesday night at USC Hillel.
BSA has hosted the awards since 1997 to celebrate the black community and wrap up the year with awards, plaques and a year-in-review slideshow.
Having attended many of the Mahogany Awards ceremonies in the past, Director of the Center of Black Cultural and Student Affairs Corliss Bennett-McBride attests that those who win the awards continuously raise the bar for leadership within the black community.
“It’s really to honor those that have gone out beyond the call of duty,” Bennett-McBride said. “I think that’s important because as people begin to get recognized … it makes [other groups and organizations] want to improve as well.”
Kyra Schoonover and Ayele Townsend, the upcoming unity chairs for the 2015-2016 year, began the ceremony with a short tribute to Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died two weeks ago following a spinal injury suffered while in police custody, and those protesting police brutality and racial profiling in Baltimore.
Students were given the opportunity to vote for their peers to win one of the 11 awards presented during the ceremony.
Aaron Ashby, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts and film and television production, views the Mahogany Awards as an important platform to acknowledge student leaders in the black community.
“There is a select group of people who have worked very hard to unite, uplift and advocate for the black community on campus and I feel it’s important to show those efforts don’t go ignored,” Ashby said.
The Einstein Award was awarded to Nnenna Ezeh and Tomi Akingbola for maintaining an exceptional balance of academics and social life.
The Congeniality Award was awarded to Naa Adei Mante and Joy Ohiomoba for their exceptional and uplifting personalities.
The Renaissance Award was awarded to Jason Gooden and Princeton Parker for their display of many talents, skills and areas of knowledge.
The Faithful Award was awarded to Ama Amoafo-Yeboah and Nnenna Ezeh for their display of dedication, exemplary service and commitment to a greater community.
Ama Amaofo-Yeboah is the current executive director of Program Board. One of her accomplishments was the ITooAmUSC social media campaign which served as a platform to recognize members of minority groups on campus.
“I just really want to make sure that not just us, but incoming students into this community or that want to be a part of this community, can have a great Trojan experience and can be successful,” Yeboah said.
The Exemplar Award was awarded to Rebecca Berry and Markeith Royster, graduate students, who were deemed great examples and excellent role models by the black undergraduate student body.
Rebecca Berry is the first and only 3+3 Program student.  The 3+3 Program is an accelerated JD program allowing students to finish their senior year of undergrad while also completing their first year of law school.
Mykaila Williams, the upcoming executive director of BSA for the 2015-2016 year, introduced the Outstanding Staff Member Award.
“Both of these women work tirelessly for us and I know they have touched 100 percent of the people in this room, so please thank them and congratulate them,” Williams said.
The Outstanding Staff Member Award was awarded to Rosalind Conerly, assistant director of the Center of Black Cultural and Student Affairs and Patrice Theard, assistant director of the Black Alumni Association.
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated was deemed the most active BSA member organization for this year, and Slow Jams, hosted by the 100 Black Men of USC, was named the most creative BSA member organization event.
Dr. Bennett McBride believes the exclusivity of the awards is a fun way to pressure students to get more involved in the community on campus.
“It’s a friendly competition but the result are the same,” Bennett-McBride said.  “It is still improving and involving the black community and the USC community as a whole.”
BSA also presented more light-hearted awards to various members of the African-American community.
Princeton Parker was selected to be Most Likely to Win a Nobel Peace Prize, Tobi Oduguwa was voted Most Likely to Quietly Take Over the World and Joshua Carroll, Tyreece Santana and Jason Gooden were voted Most Likely to Win a Rap Battle or Drop the Hottest Mixtape.
Parker, a senior majoring in communication, and a recipient of two awards, closed the ceremony with lasting a message to members of the black community.
“Please understand that the goal of this or any other event is to come to be inspired rather than intimidated,” Parker said. “We are meant to instill and help others recognize their higher purpose in life.”

The past few years have seen numerous cases in which football players and other male athletes at the high school, college and professional levels have been charged in cases of rape and domestic violence. There are clear indications that organized sports need to reconfigure their approach to sexual assault, but the media has not really altered its methods of addressing this issue — until now.
Amy Schumer attacked the inherently problematic aspects of football culture and their relation to rape culture with a sketch for her show, Inside Amy Schumer,  called “Football Town Lights,” which aired April 20. The parody uses the familiar format of a Friday Night Lights episode to present a scathing — and hilarious — commentary on rape culture in organized sports, but something is different. The new coach, played by actor Josh Charles, brings a fresh perspective to the team’s approach, but the team members quickly protest his one big rule: “No raping.” Upon the coach’s announcement, one school administrator angrily leaves the locker room while the confused players pose a string of absurd yet incisive questions such as, “Can we rape at away games?” and “What if she’s drunk and has a slight reputation and no one’s gonna believe her?” and “What if the girl said yes, but then she changes her mind out of nowhere — like a crazy person?” As the sketch progresses, viewers realize that it’s not just the athletic department that’s hung up on rape — it’s the entire town. The skit culminates in the enraged coach giving his team an impassioned half-time pep talk.
Schumer’s sketch sheds light on the sexual aggression and sense of male entitlement present in organized sports. The largely positive reception of “Football Town Nights” represents an important milestone for the media attention to football rape culture — especially as it pertains to a school that emphasizes athletics like USC.
According to a 2013 article for RH Reality Check, Jessica Luther reported sexual assault cases at the University of Texas, the U.S. Naval Academy and Appalachian State University, which all made headlines in 2012. As if this weren’t awful enough, 2013 saw the infamous rape trial for two football players at Steubenville High School in Ohio and the beginning of the Jameis Winston investigation in Tallahassee, Florida, as well as cases at Ohio State University, Arizona State University, Vanderbilt University, McGill University and the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2014, Luther reported two instances of mishandled sexual assault cases at the University of Missouri, and Salon said that the ongoing civil suit against Jameis Winston “hasn’t hurt his prospects as a top pick in the draft.” The list goes on, but the reactions remain largely the same.
This is why Schumer’s parody is so important. In the skit, not only do the players’ surroundings condone sexual assault, but masculinity in football promotes further perpetuates rape culture. During this climactic moment, Charles proclaims, “How do I get through to you boys that football isn’t about rape — it’s about violently dominating anyone who stands between you and what you want. You’ve got to get yourself in the mindset that you are gods, and you are entitled to this!” Salon’s Katie McDonough discusses this ironic twist, referencing this moment as the perfect example of what rape culture does. According to McDonough, “[rape culture] is insidious double messaging. It normalizes and reproduces sexual entitlement and male aggression even as it insists that rape is very, very bad.” Of course, the message, “No raping,” doesn’t mean anything unless the men in question actually understand rape because society tends to “search for monsters lurking in the night and ignore what’s in front of us” — a generation of young men who do not fully understand consent and rape prevention.
On a college campus, football rape culture is rampant. From the moment potential recruits visit a campus and female “hostesses” greet them, college football players are taught that sex is part of the exchange for their talent. The Nation writer David Zirin addresses the overlap between jock culture and rape culture, asserting that “too many young male athletes are taught to see women as the spoils of being a jock. These young men are treated like gods by the adults who are supposed to be mentoring them — like cash cows by administrators.”
This is a serious institutional problem, but it isn’t irreversible. Luther describes an alternate football culture which “would involve including a lot more women in all kinds of roles within teams, university athletic departments and league administrations,” “mandatory annual rape prevention training” and banning the use of college women as sexualized hostesses.
Efforts to prevent campus sexual assault overall are an important part of the feminist movement, but we must also raise awareness of the dangerous masculinity that organized sports tend to encourage. Football is an important part of college life, and a better understanding of how university athletics contribute to rape culture on an institutional level will allow us to hold perpetrators accountable while still preserving the fun of the sport.

There is no mistaking the huge influence Passion Pit has had on both music and culture since their debut in 2009. With a complex brand of synth and soul dubbed “indietronica,” the young band’s music has been successful in its own right and has been featured in countless commercials and films, making it nearly impossible to find someone who hasn’t heard their music in some respect. Their newest album Kindred is another impressive effort, filled with honesty and heart, and when considering the band’s struggles over the last few years, it is uplifting.
Lead singer Michael Angelakos’s personal life was always tied to Passion Pit, as the band’s first tracks were written as love songs to his girlfriend during the New York native’s time at Emerson College. Though this gives Angelakos a deeply personal connection to the music, life in the spotlight can easily take its toll. In 2012, during Passion Pit’s tour for their sophomore album Gossamer, Angelakos was admitted to a hospital for depression and the remaining tour dates were canceled. It was later revealed in an interview with Pitchfork that the frontman has suffered from bipolar disorder since he was 17. Gossamer reflects this struggle, but Passion Pit’s newest album is much lighter, and it seems Angelakos is in a much better place, as his return to the stage in 2013 came with a declaration: “Seven months ago they told me I’d never f-cking tour again, and now we’re here at Madison Square Garden.”
Kindred is full of love for Angelakos’ wife, who he has referenced often as his most important support system. The opening track “Lifted Up (1985),” aside from being incredibly bubbly and fun, is a love story about his wife descending from heaven and being grounded to earth with the strength of their love. Slow funk jam “Where the Sky Hangs” also references Angelakos’ wife.
“I’ve got somebody else just to keep me on my toes again/ I can barely stand when you’re coming too close/ I get caught up in your heartstrings/ Way up, where another sky hangs,” croons the pop rocker over instrumentals ripped straight from the ’80s. Full of soul, Passion Pit has mastered the art of feeling. Though previous albums have contained notoriously negative lyrics, this newest work finally has Angelakos on an upswing, which he has been feeling since his recovery according to an interview with TimeOut.
“The next record will be personal but warmer and about the love of settling down. I would be interested in making an optimistic record,” Angelakos said. “I haven’t written an optimistic song in over 10 years. I’m looking forward to writing an album about real love. I’ve been very narcissistic, and I’m getting bored with that.”
Companion tracks “Five Foot Ten(I)” and “Ten Feet Tall(II)” express this uplifted spirit beautifully. Seemingly negative, the prechorus in the first track is, “I wanna be alone,” repeated several times, but as the chorus comes in it becomes clear that Angelakos does not want to be alone with himself.
“All alone, I wanna be/ All alone, the two of us/ All alone, I wanna be/ All alone, alone with you,” resonates over pop bass and bright flickering synths to create another love ballad directed at his wife. The latter of the two tracks is much more solemn, sharing a melody with “Five Foot Ten(I),” but with a much slower tempo. The track is less about love and more about progress, making mention of Angelakos’ time in the hospital.
“They knocked me down and I grew 10 feet tall/ They say they know what’s good for me, they say to take it slow/ Well I can’t slow down, cause I want it all/ Darling what’s it say about me? It cuts me to the bone,” blares out of the speakers through a lo-fi filter reminiscent of fun.’s “Some Nights.” As the album’s closer, “Ten Feet Tall(II)” is hopeful and proud, featuring a reinvented Angelakos performing to his fullest abilities. There is no mistaking this album as a homecoming for the 25 year old, who was known nothing of adult life other than touring and tough times. Though this track is arguably the strongest message of the album, one other track resonates deeply with Angelakos’s mental triumphs.
“Dancing on the Grave” is the slowest song on Kindred, using one drum to fire the whole song forward, like a heartbeat underneath a breath of heavy synths. Its title seems dark, but in truth, it is a hopeful message about rebirth rather than death.
“Someone told me I should just give in and stay, and stay/ Oh come and celebrate, we’re dancing on the grave,” sings Angelakos, speaking of his former struggles with depression, and how far he’s come. Passion Pit is a band forged out of turmoil, but through the darkness of lead singer Michael Angelakos’s past comes a vibrant reflection on life and love, and most importantly, recovery.

Since Vine is now everyone’s friendly neighborhood supplier of six-second morsels of entertainment, it’s easy to forget that not that long ago, making comedy pieces that last for far less time than it takes to tie your shoe did nit exist. Years before all of that, before “doing it for the Vine” was a part of our lexicon and 1.5 billion loops were playing daily on the website, 5-Second Films was entertaining the Internet without the luxury of that decadent sixth second.
Founded in the mid-2000s a group of USC School of Cinematic Arts students and led by screenwriting major Brian Firenzi began making exactly what their group title suggests: short, often absurdist comedy clips, all of which are only five seconds in length. The company launched its website, 5secondfilms.com, in 2008 and proceeded to gain an Internet cult following. Now, after seven years of releasing short films five days a week almost every week, the team has completed a feature film. Clocking in at just over 93 minutes — that’s 1,120 times the screentime they are used to working with — Dude Bro Party Massacre III (there is no I and II) is set to premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival in mid-June.
By all appearances, the film takes the absurdist humor that 5SF is used to providing and turns the dial up several notches. From the very beginning, the humor of 5-Second Films was out there. After having come up with the concept at the annual Ed Wood film festival, Firenzi and his film student friends in New North quickly found that, perhaps unsurprisingly, five seconds did not allow a lot of time for plot development.
What the clips lacked in plot development, however, they more than made up for in quick-hitting humor. This often took the form of a compelling image or some classic slapstick. From the very beginning though, there was a strong vein of absurdity — often deliciously dark — in the films they were making. The groups first big hit, Magic Show Volunteer, features now-longtime 5SF cast member Olivia Taylor Dudley coming to the stage of a magic show. The magician, played by Firenzi, notes that she is pregnant, declares “not anymore” and makes her belly disappear. The camera cuts away from a horrified Dudley to Firenzi who is slowly removing a newborn child from his mouth. The film now has 1.3 million views. It is clear that this twisted undercurrent was part of the appeal of 5SF from the very beginning. But that wasn’t the whole story.
Michael Rousselet, a longtime 5SF castmember who was there almost from the beginning, said it took a lot of work to get the films off the ground.
“[Firenzi] was sociopathically stubborn about ‘I’m going to do this every day’ when the videos were getting like 20 views each. He was like, ‘No. Gotta keep posting.’ And, really, that’s what it took. For a few months you had to keep at it, even though he was all alone in it, you just had to keep doing it,” Rousselet said.
The group went through a period during which only their friends were watching, but they fell in love with the format, according to Rousselet.
“We didn’t know what we were doing. We were addicted,” Rousselet said.
Soon, after the success of Magic Show Volunteer, the group began to attract more and more viewers. Eventually celebrities such as Patton Oswalt, Peter Stormare and Weird Al Yankovic began to express their appreciation for the shorts and eventually made cameos in them. The films were officially a hit.
After five years of hammering out those films, however, the group began to get restless. The highly creative group of USC SCA grads was itching to try its hand at a format longer than five seconds. This led to the start of the project to make Dude Bro Party Massacre III. Based on a popular five-second film and a fake trailer they made, the group launched a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of $200,000. According to Rousselet, that process was “the most terrifying monkey knife fight up a wall of sand.” But eventually ,they burst past their fundraising goal — donors clearly took advantage of the Kickstarter reward, which allowed some fan pitches to be made into 5SFs — and began working in earnest on the film.
As Rousselet puts it, the actual production put the group through even more growing pains.
“We thought that the hard part was over. But [the production] was also an uphill battle because our script was so insane and ambitious and big that the producers were like, ‘If you really want to make this, there’s not way you can do this with this budget.’ So we had to make a lot of production sacrifices,” Rousselet said.
One such sacrifice that they highlighted was the conversion of their house into a variety of sets.
The scriptwriting process sounds exactly like one would imagine it to go when a group used to writing five-second shorts decides to write a 90-minute movie. Firenzi, Rousselet and the gang nailed down an overall structure of story beats then divided up the writing responsibilities among the different 5SF cast members.
“Because this is a B horror movie and everything is very tongue in cheek and campy, we gave everyone scene numbers and we were like, ‘O.K., you do not talk to anybody else. All you have is the outline and the character breakdown. Now go write something.’ And we Frankensteined it together, just to see what it was, and it was hysterical,” Rousselet said.
But it was unfilmable. So they whittled it down to a workable script, with the story still evolving as the filming began.
John Salmon, another longtime 5SF cast member, said the filming itself mirrored the longtime 5SF style of essentially making it up on the fly with a talented group of people.
“We knew that we could manufacture things,” Salmon said. “5SF has that aesthetic where if a guy needs to fly off a skyscraper we’ll just have a Final Cut Pro animation of a guy flying off a skyscraper and, even if it looks like sh-t, it’s really funny anyway.”
So years of learning how to improvise on the hard schedule of five films a week, every week gave the group the ability to make their well-earned Kickstarter dollars stretch out as far as they could.
“There was a lot of stuff where they told us, ‘There’s no way you can do this,’” Rousselet said, “We were like, ‘We’re gonna f-cking do this,’ and we did it.”
Dude Bro Party Massacre III has a trailer out and based on 5SF’s style, the movie will likely be as insane as their short films. But the team has proven time and time again that they know how to walk the line between the hilarious and the bizarre, and DBPM3 looks like the logical extension of that ability. It will be fascinating to see just how crazy these guys get.

On April 24, President Barack Obama commemorated the centennial anniversary of the one million Armenians who were systematically murdered in Ottoman-controlled Turkey.  Like other world leaders to this day, Obama refrained from referring to this tragedy as genocide. This year marks the seventh year Obama ignored his campaign promise to commemorate the Armenian Genocide.
The lack of commemoration marks an impasse in American government: a sacrifice of American values at the demands of defense strategy. Recognizing the events would have strained the United States’ relationship with Turkey, leaving the United States at a loss in political, economic and security terms.
Turkey provides a strategic cohort in a region of adversaries. With its geographic position, influence and internal stability, Turkey is an essential partner in the fight against ISIS. Turkey has fortified its border with Syria, by putting over 12,800 individuals on its no entry list, collaborated with the United States in training of Syrian rebels and hosted more refugees from the conflict than any other country. In addition to the indispensable partnership, this year alone, U.S. imports from Turkey- — primarily vehicles, machinery and steel- — amount to $1.2 trillion.
The short-term gains are clear. Refraining from referring to the events of 1915 as genocide, however, denies the Armenian community long-awaited recognition of what occurred a century ago. Moreover, the United States, in denying that the event was genocide, speaks volumes to historical inaction in times where inaction is unjustifiable.
The lack of accountability in keeping promises can be attributed to failing to uphold standards to serve selfish interests. The obligation established by the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide Resolution of 1948, along with U.S. foreign policy, calls for intervention in instances of genocide.
Events that occurred in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Srebrenica and Kosovo were clear violations of the resolution but were ignored, as involvement did not serve national interest. In Rwanda, failure to perform any action, including action with little to no cost such as jamming the airwaves to prevent the dissemination of dangerous directives on the radio, led to the deaths of 800,000 civilians.
There’s a reason why activist Raphael Lemkin dedicated his life to defining genocide, something many would perceive as indefinable. His contributions, however, are worthless if his definition is manipulated to avoid involvement. Historical instances of inaction and a commitment to refraining from using the term genocide demonstrates that regardless of the conviction of “never forget,” the United States along with others will continue to ignore social justice issues.
Sidestepping around the word “genocide” demonstrates that the world truly has not internalized an agenda of eradicating genocide. Instead, leaders have relied on ambiguities such as “acts of genocide” or calling for more research to corroborate if actions are in accordance with Lemkin’s definition.
Recognition is an important step in healing and can help determine actions in the future. In this instance, recognizing the atrocities of 1915 as genocide would assume responsibility as well as provide a long-awaited reconciliation of the reality of the tragedy.
The centennial anniversary of the Armenian Genocide marked an opportunity not only for the United States to recognize the desires of a community whose members have been lost but also to embrace its own failures of inaction. It was an opportunity to realign commitment to upholding the terms set by the U.N. It was an opportunity to bring awareness to genocides and instill a commitment to ending these egregious offenses.
Instead, failure to acknowledge the genocide was an opportunity missed.

Each semester, there comes a time when thoughts about the transitive nature of being an exchange student truly consume me. Usually, it’s around the time I should be studying for my first wave of exams and papers, but instead, I just stare aimlessly at the ceiling for hours (and watch Marvel’s Daredevil on Netflix until the wee hours of the morning). Last semester, it was a sort of existential crisis about how nothing I was doing truly mattered to anyone else around me, and the sheer loneliness that came with occupying the limbo space of being everyone’s temporary acquaintance. Now, it’s all of that, compounded with a future-focused sort of disconnect – filling my headspace worrying about a job and a place to live once I graduate and have to leave here.
And then Rihanna’s Stay feat. Mikky Ekko suddenly comes on Spotify and all the sentimientos really mess me up. Thanks a lot, Rihanna.
Anyway. I don’t always feel that way.
A few nights ago, I saw Mujer Bomba, an adaptation of Croatian playwright Ivana Sajko’s Zena-Bomba, with some friends in a theatre space so small that the audience of about 20 people had to wedge right up by the tech crew consisting of one dude who was controlling the lights and sound from a laptop in the corner. While I’m no theatre expert, this was probably the best play I’ve ever seen in my life — and I’m not just saying that because I appreciated the various renditions of M.IA.’s Bad Girls and Evanescence’s My Immortal, not to mention the cocaine-snorting God.
There’s a lot more to say about the play itself, but the experience of seeing such a powerful performance got me thinking about the role of performativity in my own life. On one hand, a theatre performance forces you to be there, both physically and mentally, because things are happening in real time in front of you – can’t rewind if you missed it (no subtitles if your Spanish isn’t good enough to have caught all the lines completely). But at the same time, the non-linear nature of the play, which made references to global historical events and pop culture, pulled my thoughts in multiple directions. We were there, but being there involved constantly looking out beyond the space for the context.
Likewise, I’m here in Santiago, but I’m also always somewhere else. I don’t feel entirely present in my physical space. It’s like being in a constant state of daydreaming.
Sometimes the performance of the “experience abroad” entails an online performance of blogs such as this one, or of posting super cool pictures. It’s an implicit process of comparing and separating and showing how different things are from “America” (note: Chile is also in America), without much critical thought as to why. To be clear, I don’t think that there is anything inherently wrong with being performative, or introspective, or reveling in the novelty of a new life experience on the Internet, which is a valid social space in which we relate to other humans.
But I’m trying to be more critical of having this be my only kind of social performance and focus on other kinds of performativity. Being there, being here, doesn’t ever guarantee any kind of permanence. You’re always moving, always transitive. You’re here, you’re there, you’re everywhere – to quote Dr. Seuss.
There was such intensity in each of the actors in Mujer-Bomba, a kind of intensity that demands your immediate attention here and now, but is so intense that it forces you to look away or squirm back into yourself. The play was alive, dynamic, moving, and, well…transitive.
So it’s not so bad to be transitive, right?
Or at least this is what I tell myself when the existential crises hit.

During my study abroad excursions, I’ve traveled to some places that were never on my radar before. Amsterdam in the Netherlands definitely makes it on that list. Quite honestly, before I visited the city this weekend I would not have been able to properly identify Amsterdam on the map.
Yet, despite my ignorance, the city greeted me with open arms.
Though Amsterdam is sometimes best known for its liberal policies on issues that the U.S. is now just waking up [read: marijuana] to, one aspect of Dutch culture I truly enjoyed is the city’s bike culture.
I haven’t ridden a bike since last semester down Trousdale on USC’s campus. Having a bike on campus in its own weird Trojan way is a sign of status. It allows you to quickly maneuver from your classes at VKC to across campus at Kaprielian Hall, weaving past all the lowly pedestrians.
Yet, since being abroad, my memories of campus life have slowly dwindled. That’s until I rented a bike one sunny day in Amsterdam and was reminded how liberating two wheels could be. The Netherlands and Denmark tie as the most bike friendly countries in Europe, according to the BBC. And I believe it. The number of bikes I saw nearly equaled the amount of cars on the streets. The city is so invested in its bike culture that it has designated specific bike lanes, sometimes giving more leverage to bikes than pedestrians.
As I barreled on my rented bike through Vondelpark, the largest park in the city, I felt immense freedom and exhilaration. I felt like an insider of a culture that, before arriving, I had known very little about.
I was able to gage the way people relax in the Netherlands, such as kicking around a soccer ball with friends at the park or blasting music on a stereo as peers swap stories with one another. My bike took me on paths along the canals and down streets where I picked up frites and stopped by a carnival. I was able to swiftly navigate the foreign city that quickly started to feel familiar.
Though having a bike reminded me of being on campus, it was also more liberating. Unlike at USC when I’m on two wheels, my bike experience in Amsterdam did not revolve around a specific schedule. I was not rushing to or from class. Instead, I was taking in the scenery, soaking in the sounds of the Dutch language and enjoying the warm sun on my face.
And as I walked my bike back to the shop, tourists along the way asked me for directions because I looked that official. So by joining the 70 percent of Dutch people who ride bikes, my trip to the Netherlands was definitely enhanced by seeing it on two wheels compared to two feet. Some may give the advice of backpacking through Europe, but study abroad has definitely taught me that cycling through the continent is just as cool.
