If patience is a virtue, then USC redshirt freshman tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe is as virtuous as they come.
It was a moment 665 days in the making. It was a dream that traveled a total of 2768 miles — from Suwanee, Georgia to Gainesville, Florida to Los Angeles, California — in order to be realized.
It was a first-and-10 play on a Saturday afternoon against Colorado at the Coliseum when USC redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold heaved a 32-yard touchdown pass to a diving Imatorbhebhe. On Oct. 8, it was a dream realized; it was Imatorbhebhe’s first collegiate touchdown.
“I was so grateful I was able to come down with the catch, and when I got up, I just thought, ‘God, thank you, the glory is yours — yours alone,’” Imatorbhebhe said. “I wasn’t surprised or anything that it happened, but I was mostly happy about the fact that it put us up early in a big game like that.”
Imatorbhebhe’s journey to crossing the goal line for the Trojans began on Dec. 16, 2014, when he signed to play college football for the University of Florida. Less than one year later, Imatorbhebhe found himself across the nation at USC after transferring from Florida. After joining the Trojans last fall, Imatorbhebhe patience would begin to be tested, as he was forced to sit out and redshirt his freshman season due to NCAA transfer policies.
“There’s a lot of mental gymnastics you have to go through [when sitting out an entire season], because you’re grinding every day and you don’t even get the chance to put pads on on game day,” Imatorbhebhe said. “I felt like I grew so much waiting during that redshirt year … I think it’s like when photos have to develop in that dark room first, because if they don’t then they won’t be ready when that light hits them — that’s kind of how I looked at my freshman year sitting out.”
Imatorbhebhe’s allegiance and shift westward to USC goes beyond opportunity on the field — it runs in his blood. Imatorbhebhe’s younger brother, Josh, is a freshman wide receiver for the Trojans.
“[Josh’s] such a dynamic athlete, the stuff he can do on the field is baffling. Pretty much everything he can do well, I struggle with,” said Imatorbhebhe regarding the on-field abilities of his younger brother. “It’s been cool watching him grow both on the field, and off of the field as a man. It’s pretty much like just me and him taking care of ourselves out here in college now.”
Over its past four games, USC has reaped the benefits of Imatorbhebhe’s toil during his glamor-less redshirt season last fall. Beginning with Colorado, Imatorbhebhe caught a touchdown reception in three consecutive games through Oct. 22 (the others being against Arizona and Cal) for the Trojans. Against Oregon, Imatorbhebhe reeled in a deflected pass to complete a difficult 37-yard reception for the Trojans that preserved what would be a scoring drive for USC in its conference win over the Ducks.
“All last year as a redshirt, he was just one of those guys who would be staying and working after practice, always putting in voluntary time in the weight room … he’s a young man who is really maturing and developing into something special,” said USC offensive coordinator Tee Martin. “You couldn’t ask for a better young man. He’s very committed to his faith. He keeps working at his craft.”
The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Imatorbhebhe is not difficult to spot during practice at Howard-Jones Field, let alone amongst the general population of USC. While his size — even as a redshirt freshman — may be one of his greatest assets on the field, he credits his successes elsewhere; more specifically, he looks upward.
With his personal Instagram account filled with quotations of scripture from the Bible, and with a constant burden on his heart to “give glory where glory is due,” Imatorbhebhe accredits his work both on and off the field to a being which he believes to be more powerful and capable than he is.
As USC enters a pivotal three-game sprint to the conclusion of the 2016 season, it will look for continued offensive production from its tight end corps — with Imatorbhebhe as a spark plug.
“As a team, I want us to be brothers who would lay down our lives for each other,” he said. “If we have that bond, nobody will be able to tear us apart, and as a result, nobody will be able to beat us … I feel like we’re on our way there right now.”
The kid is proving himself to be a force to be reckoned with.  Defenses will have a hard time covering him over his USC career.

Though the Trojans finally broke into the College Football Playoff rankings, the team kept their heads level at practice on Tuesday. No. 20 USC is one of only two teams ranked in the playoff rankings that is not ranked in the AP, joined by No. 25 Arkansas. This week head coach Clay Helton is preparing his squad to take on No. 4 Washington on the road.
Brian Chin | Daily TrojanHomeward bound · Redshirt senior offensive lineman Zach Banner will return to his home state when the Trojans play at No. 4 Washington.
“This is a different team than what we’ve faced the past five weeks,” Helton said. “We’ve seen some really good run teams … and some really good pass teams … and now we’re facing a team that is extremely balanced.”
Washington boasts the strongest defense in the country, allowing only 17 points per game. The Husky defense is second in the nation in fumbles recovered (12) and third in turnovers (22). Off of those turnovers, Washington has scored 86 points, while allowing just seven off of their turnovers.
In addition to practicing for a top-tier defense, the Trojans are also practicing in severe conditions to get ready for a hostile environment. The team practiced with sirens, barking dog sounds and screaming, in addition to wet-ball drills and squirting water at players.
“If it’s over-the-top now, Saturday should be easy,” Helton said. “We try to get them accustomed to any noises. We are trying to get them comfortable with being uncomfortable.”
Redshirt senior offensive lineman Zach Banner, who is from Washington, said he has 40-50 tickets for friends and family, but isn’t expecting a friendly crowd.
“I’m excited to play there,” Banner said. “But they’re not going to treat me like a home crowd.”
Injury Report
Senior running back Justin Davis continued his return to the field, practicing Tuesday in a limited way. After practice, he said that he and Helton have talked about his return and he is fine with being eased back in after the impressive performances of sophomore running back Ronald Jones II.
Another sophomore running back, Aca’Cedric Ware, worked with trainers today. Also on the offensive side of the ball, junior offensive lineman Damien Mama didn’t practice due to a sore knee, but is expected to return Wednesday.
Redshirt senior defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu didn’t practice, but Helton said he is hopeful he will return this week. Sophomore defensive back Iman Marshall was held out of practice with a hamstring injury. Junior cornerback Jonathan Lockett continued to struggle with a hip injury and was held out. Senior linebacker Michael Hutchings practiced, but Helton said they are trying to protect his calf injury but it is holding up.

Today, I was given the impossible task of writing something in a newspaper not relevant or related to the election. So I’m writing about the only thing almost as interesting and important as choosing our next president: choosing the head coach of USC football, of course.
Tal Volk | Daily TrojanTop dog · First year head coach Clay Helton has turned his season around after starting 1-3, with all the losses coming away from the Coliseum. Now Helton is preparing the 6-3 Trojans to play undefeated No. 4 Washington.
I’ve been wrong plenty of times in my four years as a Daily Trojan columnist — picking USC to lose at Stanford in 2014, endorsing Max Browne as our best bet at quarterback this year and defending former defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox on numerous occasions, just to name a few.
But I’ve never been more off in one of my assessments than I was at this exact point in the season last year.
It was the Wednesday before USC took on Washington. The Trojans were hosting the Huskies the following day, as part of the Pac-12 conferences Thursday night game schedule. It was the first time Washington head coach Chris Petersen and USC’s then-head coach Steven Sarkisian were set to duke it out from the sidelines after settling in on their new jobs.
Both had been considered for the USC job that had been vacant after the 2013 season — when former head coach Lane Kiffin was fired in the middle of the year and Ed Orgeron famously stormed off from the interim job after it was announced he was not in consideration for the full-time gig before the team’s bowl game. Then-athletic director Pat Haden ultimately tapped Sarkisian — who was Washington’s head coach at the time — and Petersen jumped from his mid-major conference job at Boise State to the opening with the Trojan’s northernmost Pac-12 rival about a week later.
I had a take on that decision before the game, and offered the following conclusion in hindsight:
“Should the Trojans have hired Petersen over Sarkisian? Probably not.”
Sure enough, Petersen’s unranked Washington team upset the No. 17 Trojans in the Coliseum 17-12, and Sarkisian was dismissed from his position later that week due to a substance abuse problem. Sarkisian no longer has a head coaching job, while Petersen has led the Huskies to an undefeated season and No. 4 ranking. If the season were to end today, Washington would hold the final spot in the College Football Playoff.
I’d be remiss not to mention a third major player in all these decisions: Clay Helton. When Orgeron quit the interim head coaching job before the Trojans’ bowl game in 2014, it was Helton who was given the keys to house-sit the Trojan estate for the month of December, before Sarkisian was given ownership for the start of the 2014 season.
Helton was able to take command and earn the respect of the Trojans, as their third head coach that season, and lead the team to a definitive 45-20 victory over ranked, then-11-1 Fresno State team.
In a slightly larger sample size, after Sarkisian’s tenure went up in flames in the middle of the 2015 season, Helton got another chance as USC’s interim head coach, and he put together a 5-2 streak. The Trojans fell 41-31 at then-No. 14 Notre Dame, when Helton was given less than a week to prepare the team. The Trojans also lost at then-No. 23 Oregon 48-28. But between those two losses, Helton put together a four-game winning streak in conference play, including a huge 42-24 win at home against then-No. 3 Utah. Then, in the the one truly must-win game for any lifelong Trojan fan, USC beat up on then-No. 22 UCLA, winning 40-21. They won back the Victory Bell for the Trojans for the first time in four years, and despite three loses in conference play, earned the Trojans a Pac-12 South division title and an appearance in the Pac-12 Championship.
Then cue the next move by Haden that is still being examined in 20-20 hindsight. Before even playing the Pac-12 championship game later that week, and way before the Trojans’ season would ultimately end after a then-to be determined bowl game, Haden promoted Helton from the interim head coach to the full-time program head. It was a 180-degree turn from his handling of a popular interim head coach in Orgeron.
What followed was about the worst possible start Helton or Haden could have imagined. The Trojans were blown out by Stanford for the second time that season in the Pac-12 title game, and then were defeated by Wisconsin in the Holiday Bowl. The 2016 season was even more brutal, featuring a 52-6 beatdown against the defending national champion in Alabama, another definitive defeat to Stanford and a last minute loss to divisional rival Utah all in the span of four games.
But then Helton and the Trojans turned it around. Despite some mounting pressure and questioning of his credentials, the Trojans won five conference games in a row and jumped right back into the divisional title picture.
And that leaves us right where we are today. The Trojans have a chance for a big conference win, playing the one team in the conference sitting in a playoff spot. Though it’s not in the friendly confines of the Coliseum, it has to bring back memories of last year’s Utah game, which the Trojans won by three possessions.
The matchup begs a new set of big 20-20 hindsight questions: Should the Trojans have gone for Petersen when they first had the chance in 2014, or is Helton the right guy for the job long-term?
Of course, the hiring of Sarkisian went through less vetting than it needed, but it’s too hard to guess whether Petersen really would have been the best fit here. No one besides Petersen and Haden really know how much interest was on either side.
What we can say at this point is that if a guy like Petersen is the key to leading Washington to prominence, we have a pretty comparable man leading our program. Of course, Helton’s tenure as an interim head coach is no comparison to Petersen’s success at Boise State, which maybe would give him an edge over Helton on recruiting trails.
But both are likable, trustworthy men who players like to play for, and parents like to see their kids sign with. If the Trojans can prove that they really stack up with Washington this Saturday, it could be a great sign of what’s to come in the near future with Helton in charge.
Luke Holthouse is a senior majoring in policy, planning and development and print and digital journalism. His column, “Holthouse Party,” runs on Wednesday.
So beating a bunch of bad teams means Helton is suddenly a great fit?  Until he gets them in a serious conversation for the pac 12 title and playoff, he’s still a lazy, bad hire by a moron of an AD.  USC and its weird clinging to these internal type hires is why they’ve been a mediocre program post-sanctions.
Flip flop. Weren’t you calling for Helton to resign?

Last Friday’s exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles was a particularly special day for the women’s basketball team. USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke reunited with former Trojan teammate and women’s basketball icon Cheryl Miller, who is in her first season coaching Cal State. Prior to the game, Cooper-Dyke presented Miller with a gift and the two legends shared an emotional embrace. When the tears subsided, fans at the Galen Center were presented with a preview of what looks to be a promising 2016-2017 campaign.
“I think we are prepared,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We’re young. We have some veteran leadership which is great, but I think we’re young, so you’re going to have your ups and downs.”
Anvay Ullal | Daily TrojanFresh start · Senior guard Courtney Jaco enters the season with the fifth most 3-pointers in school history and scored 17 points with five 3s in Friday’s exhibition game. The team begins their 2016 campaign on Friday.
This season, the Women of Troy have five freshmen; a high number that shows the team is in a transitionary period. However, performances by two freshmen, guard Minyon Moore, who scored 13 with four assists, and forward Ja’Tavia Tapley, who added 10 points in the 85-39 victory, indicate that youth may not necessarily be a bad thing.
As far as veterans, the Trojans return plenty of high-profile talent. The team brings back four players who averaged double figures last season, including second leading scorer in redshirt senior guard Jordan Adams. Two experienced players, junior forward Kristen Simon and senior guard Courtney Jaco impressed the most on Friday. The 6-foot-2 Simon scored 20 points with seven rebounds while Jaco, who has the fifth most 3-pointers in school history, shot her way to 17 points on a characteristic five 3s. In addition to returning players, USC adds center Ivana Jakubcova, a 6-6 senior transfer from Kentucky. She amassed 6 points and 6 rebounds in her debut.
Asked who on the team was poised to have a breakout season, Simon was confident in the leaders of the team.
“I think Courtney will,” Simon said. “I think she had a great year last year. She played the two all her life and she came in at the one last year and really did well, so I think she’ll have a breakout season.”
This season, USC will look to improve on an uneven 2015-2016 season. The Trojans initially jumped out to a 12-0 start, but floundered once conference play began. They ultimately finished with a 19-13 record, missing the NCAA Tournament for the second straight year.
“Offensively, I just thought we were inconsistent last year,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We didn’t always share the ball. Today was a perfect example of sharing the ball, where we had in the first two quarters seven assists and in the third and fourth quarter we ended up with 21 assists. That’s sharing the ball, that’s team basketball, that’s how we are going to compete in the Pac-12.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between this year’s team and last year’s team will be height. For the first time in program history, USC has five players who are taller than 6-foot-3, an astounding number that will certainly give the team a towering advantage. The Trojans carried a modest +0.7 rebounding margin per game last year. However with the likes of Jakubcova (6-6) and Dani Milisic (6-4) among others, that number is likely to improve.
It was fitting that the season began with a matchup between Miller and Cooper-Dyke. This year, the new Women of Troy will look to expand on the legacy that those two created and try to carve their own paths as the next generation of female USC student athletes. That quest will continue when the Trojans officially tip-off the season against Hawai’i this Friday at the Galen Center.
“We paved a way,” said Cooper-Dyke of her and Miller’s contributions. “Now it’s time for them to put their own bricks down that path.”

The USC Performing Arts Committee, a branch of Undergraduate Student Government, will host the third annual Cirque ’SC, an aerial and acrobatic show on campus. Students can spend Friday night under the stars as PAC presents its largest event of the year, which will feature carnival games, prizes, acrobatic stunts and the unique talents of Dream World Cirque.
Photo courtesy of Performing Arts CommitteeDream come true · Cirque ’SC will feature L.A.-based group Dream World Cirque. The cirque artists have a strong reputation in the entertainment industry, having appeared in a variety of television shows, music festivals and venues in Southern California, including USC.
Dream World Cirque is a collective of circus artist that perform throughout the L.A. area. The company was created by aerial artist Jena Carpenter with the idea of providing an innovative space for Cirque performers and creating a platform to push the boundaries of live performance. Dream World Cirque achieves this with their interactive shows that include aerial silks, contortion, hoops, juggling, and stilts, as well as live original music, LED props and electrifying costumes.
Since the company’s inception, they have gained much popularity, making appearances on TV shows such as Grey’s Anatomy, Vegas, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, 90210 and more. In addition to on-screen performances, the company has extensive experience performing live, from events like Lightning in a Bottle, 4th of July at the Queen Mary in Long Beach and the VIZIO Holiday Party at Marconi Auto Museum.
Likewise, Dream World Cirque has performed at USC’s Cirque ’SC for the past two years, each time wowing the crowd with their innovative stunts. Last year, the troupe changed its routine, bringing in a new contortion platform for the finale that left attendees in awe.
This year, Cirque ’SC seeks to inspire its audiences with more groundbreaking acts.
“11:11 Make a Wish is the theme, and it worked out because the date is on Nov. 11. We want attendees to have a magical time,” said Sally Yoo, the co-director of tPAC. “Dream World Cirque is going to have a lot of LED lights ,and this will tie in with the glowsticks that we’re providing for the attendees. That will hopefully create a magical ambiance to tie in with the theme.”
Cirque ’SC will also feature several carnival booths with paint darts, ladder ball, colorful sand, a fortune teller and a photo booth, as well as free popcorn, cotton candy and hot chocolate to tie into the carnival theme. After playing the games, attendees can redeem their winning tickets for fun prizes or food from sponsors like Pocky, Hubert’s Lemonade, Smashbox and Noosa Yoghurt.
PAC is a division of USG’s Program Board that works to “bring the best of the arts to USC,” ranging from music, theater, dance, film, poetry and more.
Cirque ’SC will take place at 7 p.m. on Nov. 11 in McCarthy Quad. The event is free and open to the public.

Last month, the BNT board received a plethora of one-act play submissions for this event, but ultimately had to select their top four favorite pieces. At the event, these four selections will be performed, which range from 15 to 45 minutes in length.
The plays cover a diverse range of topics and genres, but also highlight the works of some of the most promising writers, directors and actors on campus.
Over the past month, these student creators have been hard at work, perfecting their performances and preparing for this special event. In spite of the chaos of midterms and other academic obligations, they dedicated countless hours to these short plays, hoping to demonstrate their talent and creative prowess.
Throughout the process, students had the chance to create work that was uniquely their own. Without a predominant faculty presence, the students here were able to take more of an active role in the productions.
In Please Stay, a young actress loses sight of her priorities amid the often alluring aspects of show business, abandoning her family in the process. Though this piece is only 15 minutes long, Caddick explained that it not only explores relevant themes in an effective way, but also addresses an issue that aspiring entertainers should not ignore.
“It was neat because we got to have so much autonomy in the process,” said Marisa Caddick, the director of the play.
Caddick also expressed her appreciation for the Brand New Theatre, which allowed students to create their own productions. She said the student collaboration was key to the creative process.
“Because we were working with student playwrights, the actors and directors had more of an influence in the final product,” she said. “It was rewarding to see those collaborative ideas come to life.”
Students interested in attending are encouraged to reserve their tickets in advance. Five dollar donations are suggested for donations.

Q: I transferred here this semester as a junior and I feel like it’s very difficult to integrate into USC’s culture. Any advice? 
Over the last four years that I’ve been at USC, I can’t say that I understand USC’s culture. Therefore, it’s hard for me to touch upon how you can integrate into it. The culture here can be so different depending on the circle of people and it’s a beast with so many different personalities. But… that’s a good thing! 
I know coming in as a transfer student is definitely not easy. USC has a terrible transfer orientation program (from what I know of it). However, this school does have great students and I’m positive you will find your place. There are over 18,000 undergraduate students here with different personalities so I’m 100% certain you’ll find where you belong. 
In terms of advice, I would go out and try things because you never know what you’ll fall in love with. What you did at your old school doesn’t have to define what you do here at USC. What you did in high school doesn’t have to define what you do here at USC either. If there’s one thing I regret about my USC experience, it’s that I didn’t try more things. I wish I tried taking language courses, a Maymester, etc. You’ll meet people from vastly different walks of life than you and that’ll help you understand where you belong. 
Also, remember that you never have to stay. You never have to stay in a club you don’t want to be in. You never have to stay in your major. You never have to stay in a toxic relationship (a friendship or a romantic relationship). So try and meet new people. I know it’s not as easy as freshman year when you live in dorms but you can do it! Make new friends in class, go visit a club’s general meeting, rush if you want, etc. You’ll learn to surround yourself with people that challenge you and push you to be a better version of you. So go out and meet them. True friends don’t come by often and as you begin to meet new people, you’ll learn who you vibe well with and who you truly want to stay friends with. 
It may sound scary (especially if you’ve never done it before or if you feel you’re more shy), but putting yourself out there is worth it. Trust.
