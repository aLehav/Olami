With each passing day, it appears more and more likely that Joe Biden will be our next president. No matter where you look, whether it’s the polls or the debate stage, all signs point to an upcoming Biden presidency.
For California, a Biden presidency would mean a lot. Though the former vice president is no darling in the eyes of the Democratic Party’s progressive flank, his victory would mean that California’s 183,000 DACA recipients would no longer be under assault, California’s environmental regulations would no longer face constant challenges from the federal government and more Californians might have access to healthcare, assuming Biden’s healthcare proposal passes. 
A prospective Biden victory would also mean a wide-open Senate vacancy following Sen. Kamala Harris’s ascension to the vice presidency. The vacancy would last two years, in accordance with the time Sen. Harris has left to serve on her current term, and only California Gov. Gavin Newsom has the authority to fill it. 
Our state’s political bullpen has no shortage of political star power. From Karen Bass, the Los Angeles congresswoman whose leadership on a police reform bill made her a favorite to join the Democratic ticket, to Ro Khanna, a progressive Bay Area congressman who served as the national co-chair of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign, the list of candidates who could replace Harris is deep and diverse. However, for reasons of both morality and democratic responsibility, regardless of who Newsom appoints to become California’s next Senator, the appointee must be Latine. 
The first reason should be obvious to most Californians: representation. California’s population, the largest of any state in the union, is 39% Latine. Let me repeat that: Thirty-nine percent of California’s population is Latine. That means this state is home to about 15.6 million Latine Americans, a larger Latine population than any other state. Despite the statistic, and despite the essential role Latines have played in the state’s economic and cultural development since it was founded, California has never been represented by a Latine U.S. Senator. In light of this disappointing history, it would feel criminally unjust and insensible to not take the opportunity to ensure that the state’s senators finally resemble their constituents. 
The governor will not be short for choices, either. The names of several prominent Latine Americans have already been floated to replace Harris. Among the most prominent names are Xavier Becerra, Alex Padilla and Hilda Solis.  
Becerra previously represented Downtown Los Angeles in the U.S. House of Representatives and currently serves as California’s attorney general, where he has made a name for himself by taking the Trump Administration to court at least 100 times. Padilla is California’s secretary of state and is currently at the forefront of confronting voters’ rights issues. Solis is a member of LA County’s Board of Supervisors, represented East L.A. in the U.S. House of Representatives for nearly a decade and served as President Obama’s secretary of labor for over three years. 
Clearly, any one of the aforementioned public servants would make for a fine U.S. senator. The wealth of options for Newsom doesn’t end with them either. In August, Luis A. Alejo and Richard G. Polanco, former chairpersons of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, offered a list of 15 Latine candidates to replace Harris to the Sacramento Bee, including Becerra, Padilla and Solis. By appointing any one of the public servants proposed in Alejo and Polanco’s opinion piece, Newsom would not only be choosing among the most representative candidates but the most qualified as well. 
And today, qualifications and competence are desperately needed. Our state faces myriad catastrophes of unprecedented destruction — the coronavirus pandemic, economic recession and unrelenting wildfires. What’s more is that decades of systemic racism and oppression have forced California’s Latine community to bear the brunt of the catastrophes’ burden. 
Latine Americans account for 48.5% of California’s 16,000 coronavirus deaths. According to a recent poll by the Latino Community Foundation and Latino Decisions, nearly 40% of Latine Californians have had to use savings or retirement money to pay for expenses in the wake of the economic ruin caused by the pandemic. In addition, Latine Californians are at far greater risk of suffering from the effects of the state’s wildfires because they disproportionately represent a majority of farmworker positions throughout California’s Central Valley and wine country, where many of them are in the fire’s direct path and face housing instability and exposure to thick heavy smoke while working in the fields.  
There is a trope that journalists give a voice to the voiceless. The same trope is occasionally applied to politics, where candidates sometimes campaign on the idyllic notion that they will serve as a voice for their voiceless constituents. The problem with this, however, is that the “voiceless” have voices, but no one is listening to them. It’s time our governor addressed this, and he will have no greater opportunity to do so than when he appoints California’s next U.S. senator. For the sake of California’s Latine communities, and for the sake of all of us who call California home, let’s hope he makes the right choice.

Since their debut under YG Entertainment in 2016, BLACKPINK has helped progress K-Pop to a new level of global popularity. Selling out world tours, breaking numerous records and collaborating with big names including Lady Gaga, the four-person girl band has attracted a massive fanbase of “Blinks” from all around the globe.
Following their 2018 and 2019 EP releases, Blinks have anticipated the release of the band’s debut Korean studio album, “The Album” for four years. Excitement grew after the release of the album’s first single, “How You Like That” in June. The single was an instant hit, setting the record for the most-viewed music video on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. While the song gained immediate success, it bears many similarities to the group’s previous songs, “DDU-DU DDU-DU” and “Kill This Love.”Like “How You Like That,” several songs from “The Album,” such as “Crazy Over You” and “Pretty Savage” are characteristic of a repetitive structure and formula. They share a similar upbeat EDM beat driving the verses. It slows down for the pre-chorus but quickly ramps back up for an anticlimactic beat drop leading into the chorus.
This pattern throughout “The Album” leads to a  lack of variety in the styles of songs; however, it is worth noting that the same group of producers and writers work on the majority of BLACKPINK’s work, accounting for its commonalities. Some of the lyrics also don’t make sense (“If you get our name wrong, du-ddu-du-ddu hit” in “Pretty Savage”), and some are straight-up onomatopoeias (“Bada bing, bada boom, boom, boom” in “How You Like That”) making the lyrics feel secondary to the EDM beat.
Nonetheless, these tracks go hard with a full fanfare of whistles and percussion and layers of technology. Catchy and upbeat, the songs boost adrenaline, stimulate a momentary sensation of self-confidence and empowerment and are (thankfully) motivating in the gym.
There are some other gems that make up for the unoriginality of almost half the album. Released earlier in August, the collaboration with Selena Gomez stands out. “Ice Cream” is the epitome of “ultimate summer vibes,” and the bubblegum pop single is lighter and bubblier than the EDM tracks that dominate “The Album,” showing a fun and refreshing side of BLACKPINK.In contrast to the more upbeat and lively tunes, “You Never Know” is chill and melancholic. The album’s eighth and final track is undoubtedly its most distinctive. Raw and vulnerable, the substantive lyrics about moving past struggles under the guise that nothing is wrong creates a melancholy yet empowering mood. The lyrics, “But you’ll never know unless you walk in my shoes / ’Cause everybody sees what they wanna see / Wonderin’ if I gotta try pretending” are especially revealing. BLACKPINK’s members’ smooth vocals perfectly blend with the same repeated five piano chords, complementing the simple melody.The way each member sings with such sincerity is telling of the emotions they feel. Furnishing the soundtrack with emotive substance and variety, “You Never Know” might just be one of BLACKPINK’s most vulnerable pieces and definitely a top contender from this album.Another important note about “The Album” is its role in transitioning into and facilitating an increased incorporation of English into BLACKPINK’s songs. Their recent collaborations with Selena Gomez and Cardi B in “Ice Cream” and “Bet You Wanna,” respectively, are entirely sung in English with minimal Korean sprinkled in here and there. Bekuh BOOM, a rapper and producer who works closely with BLACKPINK, explains that the girls are “going to continue to keep incorporating more English in their lyrics… to show their talent and growth, especially in language.”Overall, the eight-song album allows listeners a preview of the growing globalization of BLACKPINK. “The Album” lacks the exploration and blending of styles that many listeners were hoping for, but the four-year wait was anything but wasteful. Though many songs are structured the same, the feeling of empowerment from their songs overshadows their weaknesses. “The Album” is an explosive compilation of energizing and addicting music that will empower listeners, a much-needed inspiration to get through 2020.

Over two decades have passed after U.S. Figure Skating team member, Olympic hopeful and breakthrough competitor Tonya Harding was punished and banned from the sport for her alleged involvement in “the whack,” where teammate Nancy Kerrigan was beaten before competing in the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating championship by a gang orchestrated and paid by Tonya’s ex-husband, Jeff Gilooly. Hoping to get her story straight with the public, which had ridiculed her and accused her of lying at every turn, Tonya has attempted to appear on several shows, interviews and TV specials. None of these might’ve done her story more justice than Craig Gillespie’s 2017 film, “I, Tonya.”
Spoiler alert: Read at your own risk, but seriously just watch the movie already. It’s on Hulu.
Aidan Berg: I don’t even know whether to start with the sports stuff or the nerdy filmmaking stuff from this movie, but since I know everyone read our spoiler warning at the top I’m just going to go right to the element I enjoyed the most: Lavona, who is Tonya’s mother and is played by Allison Janney, is an all caps ICONIC character. Best part of the movie to me. 
Lauren Mattice: Allison Janney is one of the best actresses working today, but her role as Lavona really gave an insight, even in a “nonfiction” movie, into what made her daughter the fierce competitor that she was. You know Lavona and Tonya’s ex-husband Jeff Gilooly both seemed to take any chance to either beat her down or take advantage of her success, but with the former it isn’t so clear what all of her motivations are. The relationships between all of them are still a he-said-she-said-she-said controversy to this day, but Tonya has repeatedly come public with stories of abuse after the general public ostracized her.  
AB: You’re right, I shouldn’t be so quick to put this character on a pedestal, but it is purely because of the way in which she is horrible that I enjoyed Lavona so much. This is the most quotable movie I have seen in a long time, and I should have seen that coming when in the first 10 minutes of the movie she tells Tonya’s coach “Lick my ass Diane, she can do a fucking triple.” She was picture perfect, and the way the movie establishes Tonya and Lavona’s relationship from the beginning sets up Tonya’s arc so well. And then, of course, Margot Robbie comes in and knocks it out of the park. 
LM: The writing and delivery of these lines was absolutely incredible and amusing at a lot of points, but I think the Lavona quote that stands out to me after dozens of times watching this film is, “I made you a champion, knowing you’d hate me for it. That’s the sacrifice a mother makes! I wish I’d had a mother like me instead of nice. Nice gets you shit!” Through the mock interviews and scenes you definitely get a sense of what Tonya and her mother had to work through for Tonya to be a champion. Quite simply, they were considered white trash, and Lavona constantly working to pay for Tonya’s lessons while Tonya eventually sacrificed education to do the same is not a side you get to see in the figure skating world.
AB: And that’s the biggest sports consideration of this: the motivations behind the athlete. Skating was how Tonya shaped her entire life. As she says at the end, it’s all she knew. She had to endure beatings and verbal abuse from her mother because of her performance, so she put everything into this. And that’s when Robbie really shines the brightest. She had a close-up while looking into the mirror before her Olympic performance toward the end of the movie where she’s applying makeup, and she shifts back and forth from a look of absolute horror at the thought of messing up and an unsettling wide-eyed smile that just gave me the creeps. You can see how literally everything in her life depends on performing this one time, and I don’t know many actors who could have portrayed it better than Robbie did.
LM: I’ll take this chance to disagree with you, and I thought that look was literally the breaking point for her, and I cry every single time. A culmination of years of turmoil because of the sport leading up to one chance at the Olympics and all the shit snowballing after couldn’t have been better posed to audiences with that close-up. Robbie is incredible as Harding not just in this scene, but she really nails different parts of Tonya that aren’t readily known to us besides her sometimes brash exterior, including her shyness when meeting Jeff for the first time, the classic Pacific Northwest accent, the drama of her interview and the quick and funny quips she lets loose to stand up to her mother. Not only that, but Robbie prepared for five months just on the skating part of the performance, dedicating 20 hours a day to getting her rhythm on the ice and even practicing her skating the day before her wedding. 
AB: That transitions nicely to some of the better filmmaking aspects of “I, Tonya.” The skating scenes are pretty great because of the access afforded by a cameraman who could capture a whole performance while skating himself, which is baffling to me even if they did take some liberties with noticeable CGI. The ability to track a routine in a sport already given to gracefulness is captivating with closeups is impressive to say the least. I also thought the mockumentary element with multiple unreliable narrators was crucial to this movie’s unique vibe: It’s a black comedy where the characters will turn to you, raise an eyebrow and make a funny quip even as their life is devolving into ruin. It jumps in and out of being that mockumentary style especially at the beginning, which is kind of jarring, but it pulled me back in when Tonya fires a shotgun at Jeff’s retreating head before staring straight at you and saying “This didn’t happen.” 
LM: It was a really interesting choice to put that element of “Well, did this really happen? Who are we supposed to believe?” because it forces those watching to take in Tonya’s point of view and then ask the same questions that the press and tabloids had for her in 1994. To me, this was the only way to set up this narrative. The film isn’t concerned with who’s right or wrong, who knew what when, what happened or didn’t, because you overwhelmingly feel, as both Robbie and the real Tonya are so good at engendering in people, something powerful for or against her at the end. It’s also no coincidence how the public ridiculed her and how Tonya is portrayed as either helpless, erratic or evil in the movie, as that is because the perception of women and especially narratives of female athletes are usually framed in this way.
AB: Yeah, one of the gripes I had with this movie was that it did kind of bludgeon the viewer over the head with some of the more depressing elements of Tonya’s life. There was a lot of domestic violence and a lot of people in the figure skating community telling her she wasn’t feminine enough for them. They’re among the most important parts of telling Tonya’s story, but they overdid it to the point that it cost her other character development that isn’t so troped. 
LM: Totally, and after jumping out of your skin at the DV and abuse at the hands of Jeff or Lavona, Tonya is picked apart by the skating community. Her background is used against her, and in a crime where Tonya had prior knowledge but no direct involvement of the assault itself, that single moment of Nancy Kerrigan’s cry of pain (though absolutely warranted) seems to supercede in the public’s eye at that point, anything Tonya went through because Kerrigan is U.S. Figure Skating’s dream girl — white, upper-class, beautiful and not concerned with pushing the boundaries of established skating conventions. It’s sad because in the skating world (thanks to my own coaches’ gossiping) Kerrigan had a larger-than-life personality, which rubbed some people the wrong way in terms of sportsmanship. But once you put her against Tonya, the antithesis of what the figure skating community wanted in a champion despite her immense talent, Kerrigan is the angel. 
AB: Sure, Kerrigan is presented as a positive character, but that’s more based on the reputation she carries into the film rather than anything the film does with her. In fact, I think the movie runs into some of the same issues with Kerrigan as it did with Tonya in terms of representing women: The longest Kerrigan is on screen is probably when it shows her “friendly relationship” with Tonya, and even then, it’s Tonya narrating over it telling us it was that way. Ultimately, we only see Kerrigan through the lens of Tonya, so she comes off as either the damsel in distress or the entitled ice queen (and I don’t mean her ability as a skater). 
LM: At least we don’t, or at least those who don’t appreciate figure skating and keep up with it (ahem) or younger generations, see this story through the lens of the press. Yes you are sort of caged in by having these roles played by actors, the presence of unreliable narrators and those breaking-the-fourth-wall scenes, but I think the most damaging thing that sort of forever shrouded the truth of what really happened is the kind of judgment the media imposed on her and dug their heels in to create a more dramatic story. Is this the best way to present sports movies, or figure skating movies in general? Of course not. But it was needed, and I saw myself in there as much as I contended with the barrage of emotions thrown at us.

Take one look at Rozzi’s discography and you’ll find a treasure trove of anecdotes and personal details from her life. Every lyric is tinged with emotion and depth — from the moment Rosalind Elizabeth “Rozzi” Crane could sing, she knew there was nothing else she could imagine doing for the rest of her life. 
“Music is the only thing that’s ever been my calling,” Rozzi said. “I just can’t remember a time that I didn’t feel obsessed with it.” 
Rozzi’s first performance, singing “I’m Sensitive” by Jewel at her first grade talent show, was the moment that started it all.   
“At that moment, I knew I wanted to chase that feeling forever and that was the beginning of my [musical] journey,” Rozzi said. 
The 29-year-old indie-pop singer hails from San Francisco and grew up writing songs and attending vocal lessons. In 2009, she was accepted to USC’s Thornton School of Music as a member of the popular music program’s inaugural class. 
“[At USC], I was spending all day, every day writing songs and playing shows on campus. I felt like I was on tour,” Rozzi said. “I thought, ‘Yes, [life] is finally beginning.’”
Rozzi’s time studying popular music performance and receiving lessons from associate professor and voice teacher Jeffrey Allen helped shape and improve her vocal and performance skills. 
“Rozzi has a very sought-after quality in the vocal arts and many of the arts called chiaroscuro … It’s the bright and dark blending, where you have brilliance and depth working together,”  Allen said. “Rozzi came to the studio with that quality and my objective was just to bring it out.” 
Rozzi developed her songwriting skills after attending Thornton, noting that it was her vocals that were impacted the most from her classes. 
“When I look back on it, I really think that the performance class and vocal lessons … changed my life as a singer,” Rozzi said. “I just learned how to sing. I would be assigned to learn a song … I would go home and practice these songs over and over again until my roommate Tatti … would lose her mind.” 
Adam Levine, lead singer of American pop-rock band, Maroon 5, discovered Rozzi during her sophomore year. Phantom Planet band member Jacques Brautbar collaborated with Rozzi on music, then sent a video of Rozzi performing to Levine’s manager, who then sent it directly to Levine. Rozzi became the first artist signed to Levine’s label, 222 Records, in 2012. 
Rozzi went from performing at small venues around campus to a flurry of tours and collaborations with other artists. She opened for Maroon 5 on their 2013-15 tours, performing with them  at Madison Square Garden in 2015. In 2014, she collaborated with Kendrick Lamar on her song “Crazy Ass Bitch,” and the following year, she released two EPs, “Space” and “Time.”
While opening on tour and releasing new songs was a great experience for the artist, Rozzi lost track of her creative identity and wanted to find it after being dropped by the label in 2016. 
“To have these very powerful, very successful men telling you what is going to work — and to have no other people in your life that you can analyze that with — was hard,” Rozzi wrote for Girlboss in 2018. “I didn’t always advocate for myself as a songwriter. It was hard for me to make creative decisions, as I didn’t know myself.” 
Now, Rozzi is signed to S-Curve Records, with direct creative control over her music and public image. In 2018, she released the album “Bad Together,” under the label. The album focuses on a breakup she experienced earlier that year and is far more introspective than her past EPs. 
“I think that on a substantial, basic level, I know myself better than I did before,” Rozzi said. “Writing ‘Bad Together’ really helped me connect with myself … listening to my gut, writing about my life, being vulnerable … I really felt that I could just be free.”  
Although “Bad Together” centers around her first romance, Rozzi describes her newest single “Best Friend Song” as the most authentic love song she’s ever written. “Best Friend Song” is a lighthearted ode to her past college roommate and best friend Tatti, who had recently moved out. 
“Moving out was a long time coming but still felt sudden,” Tatti said. “It was time, and the adult thing to do, so we tried to be adults about it — which meant crying for a minute and then continuing to hang out the same amount as when I lived there.” 
“Best Friend Song” dropped Aug. 14 and was written with Charlie Snyder and Zak Waters. 
“I remember being like, ‘Is it wrong of me to exploit [Snyder and Waters’] amazing talent to help me write down this song for my friend?’” Rozzi said. “It was a way for me to channel something that was really sad into a celebration.” 
While the song’s bright, poppy sound is somewhat different from the moodier tone of “Bad Together,” it features Rozzi’s signature smoky vocals and personal lyrics. 
“Rozzi’s always had a sound. That was her hallmark, her stamp … But now, it’s her songwriting [as well],” Allen said. “She has personalized her songs, personalized her output,” 
Rozzi sings in “Best Friend Song:” “You were there when I cried over what’s his name again / you picked me up / I was drunk / still a mess at 3 a.m.”  
“That is a very specific, real story that happened at USC,” Rozzi said. “I was crying in the Subway [shop] near Gateway at three in the morning and Tatti was tough-loving me. I remembered that night so vividly.” 
For Rozzi, lyrics aren’t just written to accompany a melody; they’re a part of her healing process. Rozzi referenced one of her upcoming songs, “How’d You Learn to Lie Like That,” as an example of the emotional catharsis she derives from her music. 
“I remember writing it and going to the studio with [songwriter] Andrew Hollander. He didn’t even know me [at the time],” Rozzi said. “And the opening line reads, ‘The last thing you told before you vanished was that this was so much more than sex.’”   
At the time, she was less focused on divulging personal details to a songwriter she had never met and wanted to release the emotional burden she had undergone. But having such personal lyrics can become a burden as she revisits them during gigs. 
“At the moment, it’s like therapy. It’s a way for me to work through something,” Rozzi said. “I … feel haunted by an emotion and writing the lyrics is like a séance. Once I’m not feeling that way anymore, it can be an anchor tethering me to an old version of myself. I need to find a way forward.” 
For example, Rozzi explained, singing breakup songs like “Joshua Tree” and “Bad Together” while opening for Betty Who’s 2019 tour became emotionally draining. 
“While on one hand [personal lyrics] are so liberating, it can be kind of awful when I’m trying to move on,” Rozzi said.  
So if “Bad Together” was an evolution from the self-described “super green” singer she was in 2018, then Rozzi’s upcoming album marks a continuation of her growth as a singer and as a person.
”It’s really the first time in my life that I feel like I’ve made a record that is exactly what I meant to say,” Rozzi said. 
For the making of the album, Rozzi reached out to British producer George Moore, who’s worked with YEBBA, Clean Bandit and Tor Miller, after getting enraptured by his work on YEBBA’s song, “Evergreen.” 
“It’s been a relationship with a producer that I’ve wanted to have for years but never quite got,” Rozzi said. “He knows how to support my vocals without overpowering them. I really wanted this [album] to be very soulful, I wanted to hear my voice clearly without anything drowning it out.” 
Rozzi noted that while her album doesn’t explicitly touch upon the current political climate or social justice, many of her personal experiences — and thus her songs — allude to ongoing social issues. 
“I think artists have a responsibility to reflect the world,” Rozzi said. “I don’t have a lot of songs that are explicitly, blatantly about a social justice issue but my hope is that people can hear my point of view through the personal experiences [I sing about].”
She pointed toward one of her upcoming songs, “Mad Man,” as a prime example. 
“It’s about me feeling suffocated by a man,” Rozzi said. “It really is a very personal, emotional [song] but I think that it reads like a feminist anthem.” 
Haunted by emotions, moving on and finding herself — these are all epithets to discover in Rozzi’s discography because, after all, central to Rozzi’s musical journey is her desire to evolve. 
“When you’re an artist, you want to reflect the person you are in that very moment, like a snapshot in time,” Rozzi said. “But I’m constantly evolving, constantly in a new phase of my life.”

The Pac-12 Conference released its 2020 football schedule Saturday, and the countdown is on: The Trojans will open the long-awaited season with a Nov. 7 matchup against Arizona State at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
USC will then hit the road to take on Arizona and Utah in Weeks 2 and 3 respectively before coming home to face Colorado and Washington State in Weeks 4 and 5, respectively. The Trojans finish the regular season slate with a rivalry bout at crosstown foe UCLA. 
The seven-game conference-only schedule ŌĆö rounded out by a to-be-determined matchup in Week 7, Pac-12 Championship Game or not ŌĆö will be one of the most unprecedented in the history of college football. Here are some takeaways as to how it shakes out for USC at first glance. 
Week 1 will be historic, for better or for worse. It could also spell trouble for USC.┬Ā
The Trojans have been known to start slow over the last few years. Week 1 in 2016 was a 52-6 beatdown by Alabama. Week 1 in 2017 was a win over Western Michigan in a game that was tied entering the fourth quarter. Week 1 in 2018 was a win over UNLV in which USC led by 5 after three quarters. Week 1 in 2019 was a 31-23 win over Fresno State in a much closer game than it should have been, preserved by an interception with under two minutes to go as the Bulldogs threatened in the red zone.
If the Trojans come out of the gate rusty for the fifth consecutive year, Arizona State may make them pay. 
The Sun Devils arguably pose the biggest threat to USCŌĆÖs Pac-12 South aspirations, and an offense led by sophomore quarterback Jayden Daniels ŌĆö who threw for 17 touchdowns and just two interceptions last year ŌĆö could give USC fits. 
The Trojans and fellow sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis came out flying last year in Tempe, leading 28-7 after one quarter on the strength of 297 passing yards by Slovis. They slowed down from there, barely clinging onto a 5-point win as ASU outscored USC 19-3 in the final three quarters. 
Week 1 should be a similar dogfight. The Trojans canŌĆÖt afford to start slow. 
The matchup will be the first FOX Big Noon Saturday game of the week in Pac-12 history, so Trojan fans will have to get up early to catch the season opener: Kickoff is set for 9 a.m.
Washington State is a disappointing Pac-12 North opponent.┬Ā
Each team is scheduled for six predetermined games in the regular season, with the last matchups still unknown (each team will play on championship weekend). In those first six, each Pac-12 school will play each team from its own division (North or South), plus one opponent from the other. In other words, USCŌĆÖs Pac-12 South opponents were already set, but the one North foe was up in the air. 
USC ended up drawing Washington State, which is, to say the least, not ideal. Ideally, the Trojans would have faced a North opponent that could have provided them with an impressive win to bolster their bowl or College Football Playoff case. 
The Trojans werenŌĆÖt expected to face Oregon, as that matchup is a common pick for the Pac-12 Championship Game, but USC could have landed Washington or even on-the-rise California and had a real shot to strengthen its resume. A Washington State matchup ŌĆö especially at the Coliseum ŌĆö doesnŌĆÖt offer much for USC, limiting its chances to make an impression on voters come bowl season. 
The Cougars finished 6-7 overall last season, including 3-6 in the Pac-12. Unless Wazzu shocks college football fans early in the season, the Dec. 4 Week 5 matchup will give USC a disastrous loss at worst and an unimpressive cakewalk at best. 
A crosstown showdown in the regular seasonŌĆÖs final week ŌĆö as it should be.┬Ā
OK, technically, USC could wind up playing a regular season game against a different opponent in Week 7, should it miss out on the Pac-12 Championship. But Week 6 was the latest USC could have possibly been scheduled to take on UCLA, and thatŌĆÖs when the matchup will happen, bringing some sense of normalcy to this truncated season.
When the Pac-12 compiled its first conference-only schedule back in late July ŌĆö before it was forced to abandon ship and put the season on hold ŌĆö USC and UCLA were slated for a Week 1 contest, and while it made sense from a health and safety standpoint, it didnŌĆÖt feel quite right. The Bruins have been USCŌĆÖs final regular season opponent every year in the 21st century except for 2003 and 2009; now, that trend will likely continue.
The longtime rivals faced off in the regular season finale last year, with USC taking the Victory Bell back by a 17-point margin. 
Of course, the Trojans will be looking for a similar outcome in 2020. But either way, the scheduling will bring conventionality back to a season that will be far from normal.

The first time I heard Jackson Wang’s “100 Ways” playing on the radio, I was elated. For clarity, the song played on one of the Bay Area’s top radio stations, 99.7 NOW, for popular music. It was also the first time I’d ever heard a Chinese artist’s song played in the United States, albeit one that was entirely sung in English. “Jackson Wang,” I remember whisper-screaming at my mother in the driver’s seat, “from China.”
It goes without saying that music by Chinese artists is relatively underrepresented in the U.S. music industry and popular culture as a whole. In recent years, though, we’ve seen an increase in visibility. 
According to Forbes, “100 Ways” was the first song by a Chinese solo artist to place on the Mediabase US Top 40 Radio Chart. Other Chinese artists such as Lay Zhang are debuting on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and collaborating with well-known American artists such as Jason Derulo. To have a Chinese artist playing on a radio station in the United States is a testament to the progress of Chinese representation in American popular culture. This is an especially significant achievement, as Chinese artists and music have and continue to provide important experiences for many Chinese Americans like myself.
Yet this moment made me reflect more critically on the idea of “successful” music as it applies to Chinese American identity’s cross-cultural nature. It forced me to re-examine my unconscious and implicit biases toward music, specifically how I believed Chinese music had somehow been “validated” by the fact that it was playing on a radio station in the U.S. This isn’t an entirely unfamiliar phenomenon. When music journalism continues to ask what strategies Chinese popular music can employ to appeal to “Western” tastes or whether Chinese music can produce a “success story” at the level of K-pop’s global success, we begin to believe that this is what Chinese music artists should be striving for. 
We shouldn’t presume that validation of music hinges upon its acceptance in the West or that it is only relevant so long as it has broken into a “mainstream” market, which for so long has typically meant the market of the U.S. Likewise, claiming that Chinese artists’ music is too “niche” for a “mainstream” audience and therefore not universal — as I’ve heard several people say throughout my life — is a deeply harmful assumption. This statement essentially implies that music is only meaningful when it’s significant to a Western audience. 
Of course, I’m not saying that Chinese artists shouldn’t sing in English, or that Chinese music that appeals to an “American” audience somehow has less quality than Chinese music for a Chinese audience. Each of them has their own merits, and we definitely shouldn’t be undermining the tremendous amount of barriers Chinese artists face, especially amid rising xenophobia and deteriorating U.S.-China relations, in having their music recognized in the United States. We should celebrate and respect the achievements of Chinese music artists who establish their presence in America and actively call for more representation of Chinese artists in the U.S. music industry.
To be clear, it’ll always be a small victory when I hear a Chinese artist playing on a local radio station, if only for the reason that Chinese artists aren’t as visible as they should be in terms of the music industry in the U.S. Yet, having that appreciation of Chinese music hinge solely upon a “successful” presence in the U.S. is deeply flawed at best and xenophobic at worst. 
As a Chinese American, I don’t need Chinese popular music to cater to a Western audience to be more valuable. Music that is significant to a Chinese audience is valuable enough. The domestic Chinese music industry is so rich, so complex and so diverse that to erase that would be to severely limit our cross-cultural understanding. To equate a broad definition of success or significance with a Western gaze is an incredibly harmful assumption to make about the transnational nature of Chinese American experiences.  
On a personal level, I believe that to value one aspect of your identity only when it is “validated” by the other half — without the same idea being applied in return — shouldn’t be how we affirm Chinese American identity. Music isn’t more significant because it’s reached a Western audience or become “universal.” Chinese artists shouldn’t need to sing in English or change their music to fit Western tastes because to do so would disregard the fact that music as a genre is universal, no matter what language it’s in or who it’s coming from. 
It’s because of Chinese artists and music that I’ve been able to engage with a cultural understanding of my own identity. Regardless of whether it’s in representation through radio or significant on a personal level, we should value Chinese music, whether it’s popular in America or China, or even if it’s not popular at all. Music from another culture, in another language offers us so much to learn about the world — if only we’re willing to listen.

Students have had mixed feelings about learning remotely ã some have capriciously nicknamed the online learning format ãZoom University.ã Indeed, students spend all their class time in front of a camera on their laptop or phone on Zoom to attend class. This is a novel form of higher-education learning, where the classic issue of another student sitting in your unassigned-assigned seat holds no bearing. That being said, ãZoom Universityã comes with its own problems ã and a lot of students are starting to speak up about it.ô 
The semester has a reduced schedule; for USC, classes will end Nov. 24. The administration decided that an early end would help regulate the coronavirusãs impact on students who go home for holidays and return for finals, which some anticipated would lead to a big spike in positive cases. Though the Universityãs level of foresight and precaution  regarding the virus is appreciated, students are still suffering academically. 
Much of this suffering can be attributed to studentsã declining mental health during this period of remote learning. Once able to walk around the campus and see the smiling faces of friends and fellow students, being quarantined in oneãs home for weeks at a time while feeling overwhelmed academically is not an ideal situation by any means. 
Moreover, given the pandemicãs uncertainty, plans have been thrust into action without much consideration of their implications. Students have noticed an increase in the density of their workloads because of the shortened schedule. Professors have declared that they are trying to adjust to the new format of learning, but for many undergraduate and graduate students, it seems that professors have not been taking into consideration the added workload. Cramming at the last minute for assignments and seemingly impossible deadlines is not benefitting anyone, certainly not students.
Additionally, many students no longer have an active daily routine to cling to and find themselves even more distracted with this new form of learning. College students are accustomed to waking up for a day of school, maybe stopping at their favorite coffee shop on their way to class and interacting with a handful of people as they maneuver through the University campus. Now, many students are waking up a few minutes before class just to turn on their Zoom cameras from bed. According to The Washington Post, students (who, needless to say, are experiencing a complete deprivation of structure and incentives to pay attention) are finding it difficult to stay focused on Zoom. 
Much of that distraction probably comes from staring at multiple screens or paying attention to what someoneãs room looks like instead of what the professor says. Adding to this distraction problem is the fact that many students are not feeling confident in the subject matter they are being taught. The obligation to turn oneãs camera on to gain attendance credit does not translate into an automatic understanding of the material. Students are working themselves to the bone to get homework in just to meet deadlines without grasping the substance of the material. This constitutes a major problem for prominent universities, where tuition is expensive, and students are paying to get a quality education but are finding themselves scrambling, not learning. 
This begs the question: Whatãs the solution? Students certainly want to be able to express to professors that they arenãt learning and that academic changes must be implemented to improve learning quality. At the same time, however, the semester is flying by (less than five weeks remain before finals) and students may be more interested in bucking down and doing what they can than in risking time and effort on seeking out change that may ultimately prove fruitless. 
Either way, this has been a decisively challenging start to the semester for tons of students ã with midterm season now in full swing, the fact that many students are expressing a lack of understanding of class material poses a real problem. The idea that the University prioritizes profit over the quality of education it provides its student body also poses a serious issue. With the spring semester quickly approaching, everything is still up in the air. That being said, Zoom University will likely be sticking around a little longer and could become the new standard for collegiate learning ã and if that is the case, universities must make substantive change.
