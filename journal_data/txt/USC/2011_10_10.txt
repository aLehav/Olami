Swiping a Tommy Trojan-emblazoned Bank of America credit card does more than just engender a sense of Trojan pride — it also generates money for the university.
Charges · Royalties earned from USC credit cards help fund the Alumni Association’s programming and add to the resources of the athletic department. - Megan Harmon | Daily Trojan
Many universities, including USC, have agreements with banks that give a bank the right to use the university’s logo on a credit card if it provides the university with a small cut every time the credit card is used.
In 2010, USC received more money from its credit card issuer than all but three universities in the country, according to an annual report issued by the Federal Reserve. The university earned about $1.5 million in royalty payments from FIA Card Services, a company that processes credit cards on behalf of Bank of America.
Some of that $1.5 million goes to fund the USC Alumni Association’s programming, and some of it goes to the athletic department, according to Scott Mory, CEO of the Alumni Association, which negotiates the contract with Bank of America. Mory said because the cards are marketed to fans at athletic events, it made sense to give some of the money to the university’s athletic teams.
“The agreement with Bank of America covers both the Alumni Association and athletics,” Mory said. “It’s a branded credit card marketed toward the Alumni Association [with profits going] to alumni and secondarily to athletics and to the university.”
Most of the USC-branded credit cards are held by USC alumni and USC sports fans, although anyone, including students, can go to a Bank of America branch and open an account.
As part of the credit card agreement, USC provides Bank of America with mailing information of alumni, donors or supporters who might want a USC credit card. The larger the mailing group, the larger the benefits for the credit card company and the institution itself.
“[Groups like FIA] provide a royalty based on the number of accounts opened, number of times the card is used or something is purchased,” said Robert D. Butters, a lawyer specializing in affinity agreements who works with a number of credit issuers.
Though USC is not paid for providing credit card companies with the mailing list, releasing that list increases the size of Bank of America’s marketing pool, ultimately leading to higher purchase rates and therefore greater royalties for USC, according to Butters.
“The larger the pool of people [the bank] can solicit, the more valuable the account,” Butters said.
Marketing credit cards to students would significantly increase the pool of potential cardholders, but USC maintains it does not actively encourage students to open any sort of credit card.
“We don’t market it to students and we don’t provide student information to Bank of America,” Mory said.
Under the Credit Card Act of 2009, which placed restrictions on credit card issuers’ interactions with students, students can be legally marketed to, but only if they are older than 21.
There are no restrictions on indirect marketing, so Bank of America can contractually advertise USC’s credit card during athletic games and on USC gear, such as T-shirts and key chains.
“[The credit card issuer] can promote their cards at football games,” Butters said. “Those promotions aren’t targeted at students. Obviously they’ll be exposed to the ad, but that’s not considered targeted at students because there are a lot of non-students in the stadium witnessing the event.”
Mory said years ago students were heavily targeted, but the alumni association has since changed its strategy.
“When the contract was first started decades ago there was aggressive marketing toward students,” Mory said. “That stopped out of concern for student financial welfare.”
Ceasing to market to students doesn’t seem to have hurt Bank of America or USC. Though the total number of college-affiliated credit card accounts opened fell 17 percent from 2009 to 2010, USC ranked among the 10 institutions with the highest number of accounts opened. A total of 536 new USC accounts were opened in 2010; in 2009, USC had a total of 659 new accounts.
Richard Perez, who graduated from USC in 1998, has had a USC Bank of America credit card since 2008. He said he doesn’t mind that his credit card use supports his alma mater.
“I don’t think it’s such a bad thing,” Perez said. “USC makes money on pretty much anything with their colors on it, so of course they’re going to get a cut from the bank.”
As for ranking fourth among universities in revenue generated, Mory said he isn’t very concerned.
“The universities aren’t competing with each other,” Mory said. “USC is proud of its program … and we’re proud that so many Trojans have the pride to want a [USC] credit card for their use.”
Their USC affiliated card has a higher APR than several of their other cards so as a student you’re better off going with a different card if debt is an issue.
That being said BoA has made a ton of bad customer service moves lately and if you want to go with a USC branded credit card, go to the USC credit union instead.

Blackberry, iPhone or Android, student life is closely tied with smartphones.
As Apple’s latest iPhone, the 4S, hits shelves Friday, students are beginning to weigh the hefty price tag of these phones against their usefulness both inside and outside of the classroom.
“It’s absolutely critical for this generation to have the kind of constant, instant and therefore mobile access to the Internet,” said Morley Winograd, a senior fellow at Annenberg at the Center for Communication Leadership and Policy. “[A smartphone] really enhances the social experience.”
Loading · Smartphones can augment educational activities, in addition to allowing students to interact socially in different ways. - Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
Winograd said having an iPhone or similar smartphone is an important part of student life.
“A smartphone is [just] a very mobile computer,” Winograd said. “I don’t think anyone would question the need for a computer on campus, and they shouldn’t question the use of a smartphone.”
A smartphone can be social and educational; as smartphones become more prevalent, the two uses often become simultaneous.
“[Smartphones] just open up so many possibilities; you can do so much networking like Facebook,” said Shelby Bartholomew, a junior majoring in creative writing. “I can email my professors [and] I don’t even have to be in front of a computer, so it definitely opens up a lot more communication.”
Smartphones, however, are expensive for college students. The 16-gigabyte iPhone 4S costs $199, and Blackberry and Android phones start at $179. Winograd, however, said any student can benefit from the services a smartphone offers.
“The apps now available are tailored to students,” Winograd said. “And it increases productivity as a student but also as an individual.”
For some who don’t already have smartphones, the release of the iPhone comes at a welcome time.
“I’m actually about to change my phone,” said Hong Pang, a graduate student studying philosophy. “[With a smartphone] I can get access to my email, and it’s especially important when applying for jobs so you can get updated information.”
As a teacher’s assistant, Pang sees students using smartphones regularly, but has not found them to be a problem in class.
“Most [students] are engaged during class and during the discussion section,” she said.
Many students who don’t have smartphones said they feel the devices are not absolutely necessary.
“It’s not necessarily important, but it’s just not as convenient — not just for Facebook, but just to be more connected to people,” said Christina Sheu, a freshman majoring in biology who does not own a smartphone. “But it keeps me from being addicted to Facebook.”
 
Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the iPhone 4s hit shelves Oct. 11.
Yeah, among other totally incorrect statements in this article:
– the iPhone 4S goes on sale (“hits the shelves”) this Friday, not today (technically, pre-orders started online last Friday)
– the cheapest iPhone is actually the 3GS, which is *FREE* with contract.  Additionally, the iPhone 4 is also available for $99, so to suggest that iPhones *start* at $199 is false.
– similarly, many Android phones and Blackberries can be had at free or far cheaper than the quoted $179 starting price, with contract
Overall, this piece is just pointless — it can’t seem to decide whether it’s an opinion piece arguing for smartphones (“critical for students”) or a whiny story about how expensive they are.  Either way, especially with the stupid inaccuracies, it’s certainly not a news story.
I just want to say to everyone at the Daily Trojan that I think you are all doing a great job, the paper has improved significantly over the years from your hard work. Keep it up, and keep passionately reporting the news to students.
maybe if they actually got their facts straight, this comment would make sense. but seeing as they get many facts wrong, including this entire article, this comment is useless.

A number of pending bills were either signed or vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown during the weekend, as Sunday marked the end of the legislative calendar.
USC’s administration has been closely tracking and supporting several bills, such as AB 1072, which deals with leveraging state resources to support community partnerships. The bill was held to the next legislative session, which begins Jan. 4.
The university also followed SB 238, signed by Brown on Sept. 28, which revokes the privileges of athletic agents if they are convicted of violating the Miller-Ayala Athlete Agents Act, which stipulates the rights of athletic agents conducting business in California.
When lobbying for legislation, USC focuses its efforts on legislation pertaining to education, health care and research. The university maintains an office in Sacramento to ensure its interests are represented in state government.
USC State Government Relations also follows and informs various departments about legislation that might affect the university or members of its community, said Veronica Villalobos-Cruz, executive director of state government relations.
“Policy areas of importance to USC include higher education, research, healthcare, labor or university operations and issues that may impact our community partnerships,” Villalobos-Cruz said. “Other bills that we monitor include those dealing with professions that the state regulates like teachers, doctors, pharmacists, dentists, engineers, lawyers — typically we monitor to inform the deans or schools and see if there’s a need to take a position or if we need to work with the professional association that represents such professions.”
During the weekend, Brown also signed SB 746, which bans minors from using tanning beds; AB 499, which allows children age 12 and older to seek medical care for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections without parental consent; AB 376, which bans the sale and possession of shark fins and SB 397, which allows California residents to register online for the 2012 elections.
Brown also signed AB 131, the second half of the California DREAM Act,  on Saturday. The bill will allow undocumented college students to receive state financial aid. SB 185, a bill that would have allowed the University of California and California State University systems to consider race, ethnicity and gender in student admissions, was vetoed on the same day.
Lisa Douglass, vice president of public affairs for Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities, of which USC is a member, was in favor of the DREAM Act because it offers educational opportunities for all students.
“We were in support of the DREAM Act because it provides equal access to all students, and we believe in putting students first and providing access,” Douglass said. “AICCU member schools focus on putting students first as members of the non-profit, private colleges and universities throughout the state.”
AICCU did not take a stance on SB 185.
Because AB 131 and SB 185 impact California’s public education system, they do not directly affect USC as a private university. USC’s recent lobbying efforts, therefore, have focused on AB 1329, which affects the funding of cancer research, Villalobos-Cruz said. Brown signed the bill Sunday.
“[AB 1329] involves how the Department of Public Health contracts with outside entities like USC, which allows them to do a grant program or give out money to institutions a bit easier,” Villalobos-Cruz said. “AB 1329 is important because it makes it easier for USC to partner and receive funds to operate the California Cancer Registry in Los Angeles.”

It’s amazing what having something to play for can do to a team.
In any sport, having the stakes raised can awaken a fire inside even the biggest underdogs, occasionally producing magical — and often unbelievable — results.
Take the 2011 Virginia Commonwealth Rams, who, as No. 11 seed, stormed their way to the men’s basketball NCAA Final Four.
Or the 7-9 Seattle Seahawks, who entered the playoffs with the worst record in NFL history but overwhelmed the then-reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints to advance to the NFC Championship game (producing a seismic event underneath their stadium in the process).
Linchpin · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley will lead USC through a tough set of games, including top teams from the Pac-12 North. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
It’s even happened right here at USC, when the 2008-2009 Trojans ran the table to win their first-ever men’s basketball Pac-10 title and secure a trip to the NCAA tournament, despite being heavy underdogs with little hopes of playing in the postseason.
But this motivation — in terms of a tangible, immediate payoff — is something the current USC football team has been devoid of in the last two seasons. For as much as having something to play for can help, the absence of such a stimulus can hurt a team immensely.
Whether or not anyone on the current team will admit it, playing without the chance to make a bowl game is extremely disheartening.
But fortunately for the Trojans, the environment they play in has given them an alternative reason for hope.
Built into the make-up of college football is the separate goal of long-term progression, which isn’t found in professional sports today. Because they cannot trade for players to make an immediate impact, colleges rely on the recruitment and development of their athletes — a process that often takes two to three years.
It’s because of this that college coaches and fans alike have an added patience for development.
A top-10 recruiting class for the next season holds almost enough promise to assuage the disappointment of the current season’s failures, as those rooting for the team know it is only a matter of time before new acquisitions produce results for a number of seasons.
USC’s situation really isn’t that dire.
In fact, at 4-1 and 2-1 in the Pac-12, the team is currently about as good as it could be given its sanctions.
The Trojans don’t need to label this as a rebuilding year, but rather as one that reaffirms the program’s membership in the upper echelon of college football.
To add to it, USC has one of the youngest teams in the country, with the number of underclassmen starters hovering in the double-digits during any given week.
Having a younger team makes it much easier to keep an eye on the future, as new recruits will end up alongside many current Trojans.
The need for success down the stretch is as high as ever for USC.
But there shouldn’t be much motivation lost either, as the potential future gains haven’t changed one bit.
Finishing first in the Pac-12 South, despite a 3-0 conference record from Arizona State — which holds the tiebreaker over USC — will help silence the myriad critics that continue to write off USC since the NCAA brought down the hammer last summer.
It will prevent allowing yet another team from knocking the Trojans down a peg in the same way Stanford and Oregon were able to do during the past two years.
But most importantly, it will prove to recruits across the country that their futures are by no means going to be jeopardized by committing to USC.
Calling each of USC’s tough matchups its “bowl game” has been one of the most grossly overused and irrelevant statements to come out since the sanctions.
But at least finishing strong down the stretch will give the Trojans something to brag about and will serve the same purpose as a “bowl-game win” in terms of some much-needed national credibility.
There isn’t a great way to digest not being able to even try for a national championship or Rose Bowl appearance on New Year’s Day.
Understanding the remaining implications of this season — ones that are arguably more important than a bowl game appearance anyway — should be enough to rekindle a fire under the Trojans as the season rolls on.

Despite boasting a number of tailbacks heading into the season, USC has become a more pass-oriented team this season.
Through its first five games of the season, USC has attempted 189 passes versus 158 rushes. The Trojans have scored 14 receiving touchdowns, compared with four running touchdowns.
Prolific · Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods and freshman wideout Marqise Lee, who have combined for 1,070 receiving yards, form a duo that rivals any in the Pac-12, including Cal’s own receiving tandem of sophomore Keenan Allen and senior Marvin Jones. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
“We have been more heavily throwing the ball,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We cannot do that all year long. We will get exposed if we keep trying to do that.”
Much of the emphasis on the passing game has been because of the continued emergence of sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods.
“If you have a great tailback, you turn and give him the ball 25 times per game,” Kiffin said. “If you have a great receiver, the last thing we want to do is come out of the game and the guy only touches the ball four or five times. We try to find ways to get [Woods] the ball and keep feeding him.”
Opposing defenses have changed their formations to try to stop Woods, but he has still recorded 55 receptions for 747 yards and six touchdowns.
“That is why he is a No. 1 receiver,” Kiffin said. “He can do everything. He can beat you deep, and he can also take the short passes and make guys miss. He plays very physical for a guy that is not that big.”
Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee has proved to be a reliable second option opposite Woods through five games. Lee, who claims to be able to dunk a basketball on an 11-foot hoop, has caught 21 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns using that jumping ability he developed on the basketball court.
“If someone is going to dunk on you, you have to time your jump,” Lee said. “I feel that I have great anticipation going up to get the ball.”
The USC coaching staff originally recruited Lee to compete in the secondary, but eventually yielded to Lee’s desire to play offense when recruiting him in high school.
“He would be lining up at Oregon probably if we told him he was going to be a [defensive back],” Kiffin said.

In anticipation of playing Thursday, the Trojans practiced on a Monday for the first time since school started. USC also practiced Sunday, normally an off day.
“We started the week early, so we have a head start on Cal,” junior safety T.J. McDonald said. “They were playing Oregon while we were preparing for them.”
Several players, including starters senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris and senior running back Marc Tyler, had to leave practice early for class as a result of the unusual practice time.
The midweek game has many players scrambling to finish essays and take midterms early.
“I am not going to lie — it is tough,” Lee said. “But I am going to get it done. I am a student-athlete.”
—
With Memorial Stadium undergoing renovations, Thursday’s game will be played in AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants.
While growing up in Fresno, Calif., McDonald rooted for the Giants. He played center field at Edison High School, and idolized Hall of Fame center fielder Willie Mays.
“[Mays] was before my time, but I watched [videos of] his catches and how he played the ball,” McDonald said. “Playing center field in baseball definitely helped my ball skills going up to catch the ball.”
—
Kiffin said freshman running back Amir Carlisle, freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson and redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris will practice on Tuesday to see whether they will be able to play Thursday.

After what Hawthorne Heights has been through, it’s understandable the band has been harboring some hate.
In recent years, the guys of Hawthorne Heights — vocalist JT Woodruff, guitarist Micah Carli, drummer Eron Bucciarelli and bassist Matt Ridenour — have fought with record labels, faced incessant criticism and dealt with the loss of their guitarist and childhood friend, Casey Calvert.
New sentiments · Hawthorne Heights has had a tumultuous year, harboring harsh criticism and coping with the loss of guitarist and childhood friend, Casey Calvert. Hoping to revamp its image, Hawthorne Heights is issuing a trilogy of new, thematically connected EPs and is currently headlining a national tour that ends this October. - Photo courtesy of Earshot Media
The band’s claim to fame was its 2004 anthem of angst for edgy teens everywhere, “Ohio Is For Lovers.” After the band’s sophomore album and the death of Calvert, Hawthorne Heights released two solid, but unfulfilling records that underwhelmed fans and critics.
The nine roaring tracks on the band’s latest release, Hate, bring the members back to their roots with heavier instrumentation, plenty of screams and lyrics laced with despair.
“We needed to be honest with ourselves and our fans about how we felt and what was going on,” Bucciarelli said. “The internal conversations we were having weren’t really being reflected in the music we were making in the last couple albums.”
Hate is the first in a trilogy of extended plays that will be tied together thematically, a concept being kept under wraps for the time being. The band already has a few songs ready for the second EP and is looking forward to the flexibility the plan will provide.
“It enables us to continue to grow as musicians and not have to spend all of our time on one album with only 13 or 14 songs,” Bucciarelli said.
Hawthorne Heights is especially proud of recording, producing and releasing Hate independently. As a self-managed band under its own record label, the band has free reign to do exactly what it thinks is best. It founded the label, Cardboard Empire, out of necessity when its troubles with Wind-Up records became too much to bear.
The name of the label, thought up by Ridenour, does not exist without reason.
“It’s a reference to the state of the current music industry as a whole and how weak their foundation is,” Bucciarelli said.
The group is looking to help strengthen that foundation with an unusual approach. It will release an official music video for every song from Hate in hopes of exposing the album to a wider audience.
“When you make a video for a song people tend to only focus on that one song,” Bucciarelli said. “They disregard the rest of the album that you spend so much time working on. We figured this could be one way to prevent that from happening.”
To promote the album, the band is headlining a national tour that will last until the end of October. In an effort to keep ticket prices low and help out fellow musicians, a different set of local bands will open for Hawthorne Heights in each unique city.
“Local music scenes are suffering lately,” Bucciarelli said. “We wanted to show people that there is good music from their areas and they should come out to support that as well.”
As the title suggests, Hate tackles subjects such as politics and relationships with anger and hostility.
“We felt that this record needed to sound heavier and more aggressive,” Bucciarelli said. “We’ve been going through a lot of drama over the years and we needed to get some things off our chest.”
As Woodruff repeatedly growls the lyric, sometimes life really isn’t fair on the track “Oceans,” it’s clear this album is not just another release for the band. It’s a long overdue therapy session.
Hawthorne Heights will perform at the Key Club tonight at 6:40 p.m.

At times it can feel like music and exercise are linked together, whether it is the radio station playing over the speakers or the workout playlist thumping from the iPod of nearby weightlifters. Some swear by music, saying songs help focus and motivate the body. But is music really a useful tool to boost physical performance or do people just like setting a soundtrack to their workouts?
It turns out science backs up the former statement. A number of studies, including one at Brunel University, in Uxbridge, West London, point out that the right kind of music can help the brain concentrate on the task at hand and make the body operate on an even rhythm. Music actually stimulates sections of the brain associated with focus and movement, helping to coordinate activity. Efficiency increases as well, as the body adapts to do more with less, meaning less energy is exerted and less oxygen is taken in.
The most important takeaway from the Brunel study is that the best songs are ones with a high tempo. Music with somewhere between 120-140 beats per minute is the “sweet spot,” so to speak, during which the brain is best stimulated and the body is most energized. This pace narrows the mind’s area of attention, which helps avoid distraction and feelings of exhaustion. This range, however, is mostly suited for running or high-energy exercises. Some research suggests a slightly lower tempo of 110-130 BPM can be more helpful for slow, controlled exercises such as bench pressing, in which a more moderate pace is necessary.
It turns out, however, coordination isn’t the only benefit music can provide. Another study found music can help distract a person from being self-conscious when exercising or playing a sport. By stimulating the frontal lobe, which helps concentration, music can actually prevent the mind from second-guessing and doubting one’s actions.
So, if music can help the body and mind focus on exercise, what genre is best? It turns out, almost any, as long as the tempo is high enough to hit that 120-140 BPM range. Anything from Eminem to The Clash can work. Fair warning — almost all country music or soft ballads are out of the equation. But a lot of rap (such as Jay-Z or the Beastie Boys) and rock (everything from Cake to Rage Against the Machine) is perfect.
Some research suggests the music should contain positive lyrics to stimulate the body and mind, but it’s not a universal finding. After all, “Loser” by Beck is a good song to work out to, because it matches the tempo range, but it’s not exactly the most upbeat song, nor are many of the other songs that match the effective tempo levels.
Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. I avoid listening to music when doing any exercise other than running, as I tend to alternate exercises quickly and often as part of a circuit training-based workout plan. If you are easily distracted, music could be a detriment. But it is very useful when doing a lengthier and more repetitive exercise such as cycling or running.
So, yes, science does point to music as a tool for increased endurance and focus during exercise. But it’s not true for everyone. For me, it depends on attention skills.
In a way it’s like listening to music during studying. For some, music can be a much-needed tool to help focus and plow through readings and essay writing. For others, it can just be a distraction.
Radios can play good songs but at the gym there isn’t much say regarding what station is on, or what the songs are. The occasional soft rock song could come on, throwing off your momentum. It’s best to bring that iPod with you.
If you’re looking for a more focused, intense workout, try adding some music to it. You might find yourself running farther, doing more push-ups and lifting at a better pace.

With the advent of popular reality shows such as Jersey Shore and 16 and Pregnant, the era in which MTV focused on music videos is over. But that doesn’t mean the artistic value and explosive creativity of these videos have been forgotten.
As a result, Chris Marrs Piliero and Dave MacDowell have invaded Meltdown Comics with an exhibition dedicated solely to works inspired by the music videos of some of the most popular songs in music history.
Intense art · Many pieces depict beautiful artistic renderings of the most popular music videos in history, such as Pulp’s “This is Hardcore.” - Photo courtesy of Jevin Studios
“I Want My Music Video Art Show” spans a variety of mediums, sizes and aesthetic flavors. The featured pieces inject the playfulness and boldness of the videos that served as their creative spark.
The minute you walk into Meltdown Comics, you are fully steeped in the comic book, anime and manga culture with everything from adapted Shakespeare plays to comic books to furry Domo figures.
Make your way through this comic book lover heaven and you’ll discover a small gallery in the back. Strung with paper lanterns, the small space holds a surprising amount of art pieces with differently sized works. The pieces have descriptions relating to the music video that inspired the piece, fitting almost like puzzle pieces to a thrillingly eclectic whole.
On the walls are the recognizable faces of popular music titans from the always-legendary Michael Jackson to today’s pop divas like Ke$ha and Lady Gaga.
In fact, Mother Monster has a fair amount of pieces dedicated to her as well.
“Let’s Make a Sandwich” is James Roper’s highly-detailed, playful piece inspired by Lady Gaga’s “Telephone” music video. A chain-linked fence, flames and leopard print, among other recognizable objects in the music video, flank a four-armed female figure with caution tape for a face.
The piece’s bright colors and emphasis on an elusive, cutesy female make the piece feel like manga (the Japanese genre of cartoons and comic books). As for composition, the piece is ambitious, assailing the viewer with a mélange of colors and designs. Fans of the video will find the piece all the more enjoyable, as they can appreciate the specific details Roper chose to include.
This is the case for most of the pieces, but it would be unwise to dismiss any of the works simply because you’re not familiar with any given music video. You don’t need to have watched all the videos that served as the artists’ inspiration to appreciate their obvious talent and creativity.
Sarah Joncas’ piece, “This is Hardcore,” inspired by the Pulp song’s music video, shows a woman lying on a bed with a telephone and a pool of blood next to her. The piece’s textures and shadows are extraordinarily executed. Certain parts of the piece are covered in a shade of gray that makes it seem as if actual shadows are roaming over the work. Moreover, the figure lies on an exquisitely rendered pillow with every fold adding to a startlingly realistic depiction.
Many of the pieces in the show defy categorization in terms of medium. On first glance, Chrystal Chan’s piece inspired by Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” video looks like a photograph. A closer look reveals the piece simply manages to capture the quality of a photo, even going so far as to use small blots of white in the background to give the appearance of bright lights. Additionally, Lady Gaga’s pouty face and sexual aura are perfectly captured, adding to the piece’s realism.
Brandi Read’s piece inspired by the Foo Fighter’s “Everlong” video creates realistic faces as well, but merges them into a more comic book-like aesthetic. The comedic piece, resembling the humor of the “Everlong” video appears to be two comic book pages, sans dialogue, pasted together.
Though most of the pieces are light in their humor, some make commentary on pop music culture. John Geiser’s piece, “Smells Like Teen Worship,” inspired by the music video for Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” shows Kurt Cobain in religious garb and a saint-like pose. The muted colors and antique style make the textured piece haunting, almost as if Cobain were emerging from the shadows.
The work comments on how Cobain was so revered he was practically worshipped; seeing his image in this serious manner, save for the small alien on his shirt, is equal parts chilling and thought-provoking.
Looking around at the pieces, it is incredible to see how much popular music and popular music videos have impacted our lives. The golden era of music videos might be gone, but we still have some videos that are true pieces of art and can even be inspiration for something new.

Four years after her last release, Leslie Feist is back with her newest album Metals. Her 2007 LP, The Reminder, although showered in Grammies and critical acclaim, was overshadowed as a whole by the dazzling commercial popularity of its cutesy earworm single “1234.” Now with Metals, Feist has created a more mature album, one that rewards its audience for careful listening, and one devoid of easy pop.
In the opening track, “The Bad in Each Other,” Feist introduces the audience to her album’s sophisticated songwriting. This track deftly combines folk and jazz influences: It opens with a sea shanty percussion line, then alternates to jazzy big brass exclamations and finally juxtaposes these disparate sounds.
Meanwhile, Feist’s lyrics in the song tell a beautifully sad, startlingly universal story, of two lovers changed for the worse by their crumbling relations. She sings When a good man and a good woman / can’t find the good in each other / then a good man and a good woman / will bring out the worst in each other.
Here, Feist effectively illustrates the tried and true tale of every stormy break-up. Two people who once loved each other can’t anymore and, in the context of their dissolving connection, they become aliens even to themselves. The tragedy of a failing relationship, as Feist heartbreakingly conveys, is that being unloved makes us feel unlovable.
But if “The Bad in Each Other” is an examination of the universal phenomenon of breaking up, it’s also the first chapter in an intensely personal story that spans the album. Metals could be interpreted as a connected series of musical memoirs. Viewed as a united work, it seemingly follows the life of one protagonist who loves, suffers and ultimately achieves real happiness.
This story progression, though probably culled directly from Feist’s life, never feels treacle or maudlin in her hands. Even “Graveyard,” the album’s second track, in which a mourner visits dead relatives in a cemetery, defies its premise’s massive potential for sappy sentimentality. The song is never self-pitying or exploitative. Rather, the track sounds jazzy and subdued almost throughout — until the end, which rises triumphantly with a joyous repetition of the song’s grim chorus proclaiming, Bring them all back to life!
What’s disconcerting about Metals is the diversity of its songs. The album hardly seems connected on a cursory listen because Feist alternates between tracks so drastically from one musical style to another.
The string-drenched “Caught a Long Wind,” for example, is followed immediately by “How Come You Never Go There,” whose synthetic-sounding vocals and plodding bass line come as a jolt by comparison to its predecessor. And thereafter comes “A Commotion,” with an urgent string pulse, in which male singers, seemingly channeling sumo wrestlers, huskily shout, “A commotion!” Listeners hoping for a connected listening experience might be jarred by these sudden swings in style.
But the songs on Metals, although not stylistically uniform, are consistently brilliant. It would be near impossible to choose one song as the album’s highlight, or as an equivalent to The Reminder’s “1234,” because so many of the songs are standouts.
There’s “Bittersweet Melodies,” in which Feist uses a simple beautiful tune to symbolize her memories of an old romance. Then there’s “Undiscovered First,” a cymbal-rattling cowboy anthem whose lyrics use natural forces as a grandiose metaphor for a relationship’s promising beginnings.
“Comfort Me,” an increasingly absurd series of 5-10-5 haikus, easily intoxicates with its melody and its structured ascent into a big boot-stomping climax. And “Get It Wrong, Get It Right” presents a montage of bucolic imagery and a serene, subdued melody.
Metals is remarkable in that it really doesn’t have any clunkers. The album’s songs are unique and complex, with meaty lyrics and intricate compositional structure throughout. There is perhaps too little stylistic connection between songs, but in light of the quality of all the individual tracks, such skittishness is forgivable. With this album Feist has delivered a collection of songs worth listening to again and again — if not for compositional complexities, then simply because they all sound fantastic.

As college students living in Southern California, chances are we’ve all heard plenty about alternative energy sources. No doubt, most of us already carry biases regarding wind turbines, solar panels and biofuels. Australian entrepreneur Roger Davey, however, introduced something new into the mix this past September.
With the help of his company EnviroMission, Davey plans to construct a solar updraft tower in the Arizona desert. By directing upward-moving air heated by the sun at ground level through electricity-generating turbines, enough electricity to power up to 100,000 homes would be generated per day.
Davey’s estimated $750 million endeavor raises an important question about the future of global energy resources: Is alternative energy worth it? The Southern California Public Power Authority seems to think so — it has already purchased a segment of the power to be generated by the tower.
The more subtle argument in favor of renewed energy is it has potential to change the scientific, economic, and, as we see here, entrepreneurial pursuits in society.
Alternative energy development lacks serious obstacles when compared to other causes. Lunar exploration, for example, has been all but abandoned by the government. Stem cell research is blocked by die-hards taking moral issue at every turn. A surprisingly visible controversy surrounding new energy, meanwhile, is the cries of outrage from those upset about its supposed aesthetic failings. No one can logically claim that the creation of energy — essential to practically every single aspect of our daily lives — is a worthless endeavor.
New energy’s biggest hurdles are resistance to creative technology and too much faith in the longevity of fossil fuels. What the public doesn’t seem to understand is that just because we’re not quite yet out of resources,  doesn’t mean we shouldn’t search for alternatives.
Davey faced this kind of opposition in Australia; this is why he took his project to the United States — a country known for embracing innovation.
As Davey’s project demonstrates, the possibilities for new energy are endless and appear to be extremely practical.

As the Occupy Wall Street movement continues, spreading across many cities in America, USC students seem to be absent from the action. Two students attempted to initiate an “Occupy USC” movement, which was not met with support. The Daily Trojan recently reported that perhaps students are more politically involved through dialogue than through protests. Regardless of whether or not this is true, students should seek to employ the most effective methods they can to promote their beliefs.
Though protesting succeeds in bringing visibility to issues, discussion has the potential to be a far stronger form of persuasion for USC students.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
Students should emphasize dialogue and discussion to create change because it is educational and establishes a holistic view of an issue.
The strength of a non-violent protest is its ability to bring major attention to an issue. A protest brings an issue into prominence, creating an event out of a long-standing problem.
But protests do not explain things or present the complex angles of issues nearly as well as dialogue does. Engaging in dialogue presents more opportunity for change because it is not a one-way conversation.
Dialogue invites a surveyance of both sides, and this is why it should be favored above protesting.
The ongoing Wall Street protests definitely bring attention to many of the financial problems in the United States, but what is wrong and what exactly should be done are not clearly articulated.
Lists of grievances and demonstrated discontent need to be channeled through institutions and discussed by both sides of the issue to form clear, political goals in order to effect change.
In the face of so many social movements is when dialogue becomes essential, for both the current and future leaders of America as well as those protesting. Discussion is how grievances turn into solutions.
The argument of the protestors is that they are the “99 percent” against Wall Street, but change is unlikely without realizing the reality of conflict is made more understandable through discussion — it’s thereby easier to come to a resolution.
USC students should not forget the importance of the individual when making decisions. Discussion has the potential to engage individuals.
We cannot entirely sever personal biases and preferences from anyone’s decision making, and that is why discussion is necessary to facilitate healthy debate.
Discussion reminds leaders they are dealing with individuals, whether they like it or not, rather than masses of people whose identities are not revealed as easily as they could be through discussion.
Certainly, we would like those who are educated about important issues and those who are personally invested to deal with the issues at hand.
Protestors on Wall Street are perhaps more knowledgeable about the consequences of many corporations’ actions than the leaders of those companies because the actions of companies often affect the constituents more.
In this sense, “education” does not necessarily mean formal education in a learning institution, but rather real knowledge. The “education” of experience that “the 99 percent” have might entail a better understanding of the economy than corporate leaders, and it needs to be communicated to create change.
USC student leaders should actively engage in educating and becoming educated through discussion to become better leaders.
As our school continues to produce leaders with initiatives like USC Leadership Education and Development, it should not fail to emphasize the importance of dialogue.
Recently, USC has been a facilitator of discussion.  The Dornsife “Uncommon Conversations” series held a discussion themed “Science and its Publics: Bridging the Divide.”
Also, the “Smoke-Free Campus Forum” allowed discussion before  the undergraduate student government takes an official position.
Students should be confident in good ideas. Discussion can test whether or not diverse groups’ ideas are good, bad or something in between. It is the duty of the educated individual to always be in pursuit of the truth. Dialogue opens the door for opposing parties to seek this truth together.

With Halloween fast approaching, costume shopping is on everyone’s mind. Halloween is a holiday known for its outrageous decor, which raises the question — in an age of wild and controversial costumes, what is still considered inappropriate?
One costume in particular recently stirred up a lot of media disapproval, though it’s been on the market since 2007. The name? ‘Anna Rexia.’
Yes, this costume pokes fun at the serious medical condition that, according to the National Eating Disorders Association, currently afflicts 11 million people. ‘Anna Rexia’ features a black mini-dress with a silk-screened skeleton and a measuring tape as a belt. It also includes a heart-shaped nametag, a bone headband and a choker necklace measuring tape. Despite mocking the eating disorder, this costume also reinforces the unattainable ideals of thinness that are constantly being portrayed through the media. Luckily, retailers such as Ricky’s have stopped selling them.
‘Anna Rexia’ is certainly not the first Halloween outfit to gain speculation. An ‘illegal alien’ costume hit stores to much criticism two years ago.  Featuring an orange jumpsuit, an alien mask and a green card with none other than ‘green card’ written on it, it was quickly taken off shelves. Last year, retailers like Kohl’s put an end to selling a curly, blonde hair accessory called the ‘ghetto fab’ wig.
Have Halloween costumes simply gone too far?

Sir Paul McCartney, 69, walked down the aisle a third time this Sunday, marrying his fiancé Nancy Shevell, 51, on the day former bandmate John Lennon would have turned 71.
The two became man and wife at London’s Westminster registry office at the old Marylebone Town Hall, the site where he married his first wife Linda Eastman in 1969. There were only 30 guests, including fellow Beatle Ringo Starr, Shevell’s cousin Barbara Walters and McCartney’s four children. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, other guests included 60s supermodel Twiggy, hair guru John Frieda and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood.
Nancy Shevell wore a simple white dress created by her fashion designer and new daughter-in-law Stella. McCartney’s younger brother Mike acted as best man, as McCartney’s seven year old daughter Beatrice acted as bridesmaid.
The reception, held at McCartney’s home in St. John’s Wood, hosted 100 guests to a vegetarian dinner and even a special performance by the Beatles legend himself. McCartney composed a song specially for his third wife and performed it at the reception, in addition to Shevell’s favorite tunes “Let it Be” and “Let me Roll It.” The guests dined on salmon and truffle risotto and $170-a-bottle organic champagne, The Sun reported.
Paul McCartney’s first wife Linda was 56 when she died of breast cancer in 1998. His second marriage to model Heather Mills ended with a bitter divorce in 2008. This is Shevell’s second marriage. The couple became engaged when the Beatle proposed in May after four years together. The newlyweds plan to live in London.

California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed into law Sunday the state’s DREAM Act, which would allow illegal immigrants to gain access to financial aid for college, while at the same time rejecting the bill allowing schools to reintroduce affirmative action.
High-achieving students who are accepted to any of the state’s universities — including the University of California and the California State University system — can earn CalGrants in 2013. They will also be allowed to take assistance from private financial institutions.
“The DREAM Act benefits us all by giving top students a chance to improve their lives and the lives of all of us,” Brown said in a statement.
In addition, students with illegal status must qualify for aid by graduating from a California high school after at least three years in the state, and demonstrate they have initiated the process toward legalization.
Some, such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform, have expressed concern about the funding for the DREAM Act. CalGrants is a publically funded program that taxpayers support.
“We have just created a new entitlement that is going to cause tens of thousands of people to come here illegally from all over the world,” Assemblyman Tim Donnelly (R-San Bernardino) told the Los Angeles Times.
The affirmative action bill Brown vetoed would have allowed the state and state colleges to consider race and gender in college applications to increase diversity.
The bill had prompted several protests across the state, including the now infamous UC Berkeley College Republicans’ “Diversity Bake Sale.” Students at the bake sale had sold goods that were priced based on the race of the purchaser.

As Halloween draws near, people begin to look for different ways to celebrate this infamous time of haunting. Although many prefer to go to Knott’s Scary Farm or Universal Studios, the one place even more fascinating is the recently revamped, remodeled and renamed bar One Eyed Gypsy, which unveiled its new look Friday.
The most talked-about aspect of the One Eyed Gypsy (formerly known as both Little Pedro’s and Bordello) is the decorations. One Eyed Gypsy has a dark, carnival-style décor that is both eerie and fascinating. Its menagerie includes ornate mirrors, beads, chandeliers, hand-drawn wallpaper and stained glass dividers, lit only by candlelight. It even includes a stuffed albino ox that greets customers at the door.
For the entertainment, a stage is decorated like a vintage circus tent to host performers from indie bands and ukulele players to sword swallowers and circus acts. There are also vintage games such as skee ball machines, a fortune teller, photo booth and love-o-meter.
With all this entertainment, an excited restaurateur will definitely become hungry. The best part is that you will not have to spend that much money. One Eyed Gypsy has a “$9 and under” menu with dishes such as corndogs with whole grain mustard, sweet potato tots and deep-fried, chocolate-soaked Twinkies known as Deep Fried Crocodiles. The array of food is like going to a gourmet food version of a Los Angeles County fair.
There is also an eccentric list of drinks to choose from that are also cheap. The mixed drinks on this menu have names such as Bearded man, the Riddler’s Punch and Surley Sailor.

In India, several Christian parishes in the state of Kerala are offering monetary incentives to couples who produce more children. The number of Christians in India has been on a steady decline, while the number of Muslims is increasing.
As in the rest of India (except the province of Malappuram, which has a Muslim majority), Hindus are the largest religious group in Kerala. Unlike many other provinces, though, Christians form a large portion of the population in Kerala. An estimated 6 million Christians comprise 19 percent of Kerala’s population.
Kerala Christians wield significant political power. Increasing the Christian population would naturally lead to increased democratic representation. Though the practical consequences of money incentives to increase the Christian population are not difficult to see, many moral objections have been voiced to Christian parishes offering these incentives.
Among these objections are concerns about India’s already large population and limited resources, the anti-democratic nature of the practice and improper intentions behind such a practice.
The Christian presence in Kerala does not share a single denomination. Major groups include Catholics, Anglicans, Pentecostals, Methodists and Lutherans. Nevertheless, a relatively peaceful situation exists in Kerala, among both Christians and other religious groups, including Hindus and Muslims.
