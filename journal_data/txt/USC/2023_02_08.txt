The Undergraduate Student Government addressed funding issues for many registered student organizations at Tuesday night’s Senate meeting. 
Student representatives voiced concerns about a lack of transparency in funding procedures. The Model United Nations applied for funding in November and received notice on Jan. 31 that USG had denied their request. MUN charges a $50 membership fee to be accessible to more students and relies on this funding to allow their members to attend conferences and professional development events, said Taylor Clanton, director of new member affairs at MUN. 
“Recently, MUN has just been denied funding that we assumed that we were going to get as an officer of USG,” Clanton said. “I do know there are a lot of issues with funding and the system just in general.” 
MUN requested over $3,000 to fund multiple conferences that they have committed to attending. The organization said it followed the funding procedure but was denied because they did not provide a payment link, a requirement that wasn’t in the funding guidelines. 
“Operating under the assumption that you’re going to get funding is pretty dangerous because it’s never a guaranteed thing,” said chief financial officer Brian Stowe. “The rules are not changing … [The application] is not reviewed until it’s completed so that means you have all the materials that the application requests.”
Ranay Sah, MUN under-secretary general, called into question the Senate’s accountability.
“I would like to question why an organization that upholds the name of USC on an international stage is not receiving the recognition we deserve and is not receiving funding,” Sah said. “If you require payment in the future, I would please state that added to your guidelines as this is not only unjust, but we just want to represent the school efficiently.”
USG said it plans to hold further discussions with MUN at a later time. 
The Senate decided to table the beginning of the trial period of the prospective First Generation Student Assembly until Feb. 21. 
“This is a disappointment to the first-gen college student community,” said Celine, a student attendee majoring in political science who spoke up during an open forum. “We make up [23%] of the student population. And yet no one is making any comment about it. This trial period was supposed to begin this semester. You were all supposed to find funding somehow and I understand that you have no control over that. I understand you all just write things and sign. But I’m here representing a community that looks to you all.”
Celine, who only identified herself by her first name at the forum, said she wanted a public apology and an explanation from USG.
“Don’t tell me budget is an issue,” Celine said, “because I have no idea who in their right mind allowed 18 to 21-year-olds to handle such a large budget that, for some reason, you all don’t know what’s important to this campus.”
Hunter Hinson, chair of the committee on affordability and basic needs, presented a funding proposal from the legislative fund for Suit Up, an event that provides students scholarships of $150 to purchase professional attire. 
Hinson requested $12,500 to provide 83 students the opportunity, an increase of 50 students. The increase in funding is due to demonstrated need, as 517 students expressed interest in last year’s event. 
The presidential debate will take place Feb. 16 from 7-9:30 p.m. in Wallis Annenberg Hall. The voting period will be open from Feb. 21-26 and results will be announced March 1.

Student Health on Feb. 14 is kicking off a series of events centered around raising awareness and educating the community about issues surrounding sexual and reproductive health, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing Tuesday with the Daily Trojan.
The events — “Let’s Be Frank Bout Love!” at 12 p.m. and “Let’s Taco Bout Love!” at 5:30 p.m. — will include information on medical services such as contraception provisions, and screening for sexually transmitted diseases. Representatives from the sexual violence prevention team will also hold workshops on consent and healthy relationships.
“We know relationships are a really important thing for everybody and romantic and sexual and personal relationships,” Van Orman said. “But we also know that for many individuals, it’s an area where they might want to reach out and get more support and more information, and we have a variety of services. This is just a good way to get people talking about it.”
A newly relaunched page of the Student Health website will also feature information and support services for sexual and reproductive health, Van Orman said.
Student Health is organizing a blood drive Feb. 21, in partnership with LifeStream Blood Bank, at USC Village from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. All blood donations will go to Keck Hospital.
“It’s great for young adults to get in the habit of donating blood regularly,” Van Orman said. “We know it’s something that’s an ongoing need.”
The blood drive is taking place in the wake of a change in national policy that will loosen restrictions around donations from men who have sex with men. Previously, federal officials justified blood donation policies excluding MSM as a way of keeping HIV out of the blood supply. In a press release Jan. 27, the Food and Drug Administration announced it would be reversing its position, proposing an individual risk assessment model under which deferrals against MSM and women who have sex with MSM would be eliminated.
“Having this policy in place … where we are scientifically [is] really contributing to stigma [and] reducing people who can donate blood, who are good blood donors,” Van Orman said. “It’s not good science, because that’s not what determines who’s at risk for HIV.”
The Biden administration announced plans to allow the coronavirus public health emergency to expire in May. Van Orman said this signifies the next step in transitioning to living with the coronavirus as a part of daily life.
“I think it’s still really important for people to still recognize that this is still a really impactful communicable disease that still results in significant numbers of hospitalizations and deaths,” Van Orman said. “But we’re going to manage it now, less as an emergency and more as something that … we have the tools to live with.”
Currently, Van Orman said, the University still has a few coronavirus policies in place. Come March, Student Health plans to announce updated vaccination policies and coronavirus testing availability for Fall 2023.
“[These are all things] we’re continuing to evaluate, [and] I think it’s important and appropriate for that transition to happen here,” Van Orman said. “I always remind people, though, that we do know [there are] individuals who are at higher risk because of their health status … so those individuals may choose and should be supported to continue to wear masks.”
Coronavirus cases on campus continue to decline, mirroring low transmission rates in the surrounding Los Angeles County. However, Van Orman noted that cases are still being detected in wastewater from campus residence halls. Even as pandemic policies ease, Student Health is still urging caution to prevent exposing higher risk individuals in the community. Influenza cases on campus are also in decline, Van Orman said, following an early peak in December.

The Charlotta Bass Journalism and Justice Lab launched at a panel Tuesday at the Forum in Wallis Annenberg Hall, with an unveiling of the Lab’s first virtual human: Lora King, daughter of Rodney King. 
The Bass Lab, first conceived in 2020 in partnership with the USC Libraries Digital Repository, focuses on curating and preserving historical Black perspectives and stories through video interviews and AI technology.
“When I started to think of this idea, John Lewis passed away and C.T. Vivian [a Baptist minister and close friend of Martin Luther King] passed the very same day; and I thought, ‘what if I could have one more conversation with these architects of the civil rights movement?’” said Allissa Richardson, founding director of the Lab, in an interview Tuesday with the Daily Trojan.  
Richardson addressed the crowd at the panel, warning that the content of King’s AI could be intense.
“Some of the details are kind of difficult to hear,” Richardson said. “So I do want to give you that preamble; but there’s also a lot of joy and hope in the message that Lora shares every time she speaks.” 
Next came the reveal: Bass Lab team members demonstrated how to interact with the AI and the breadth of questions one could ask. The AI answered questions about Rodney King’s beating, his personality and even speculated as to what he would think of the world today.
Richardson’s research centers on how African Americans utilize social media and mobile technology, especially in times of crisis. While conducting her research at USC, Richardson said, she realized that there wasn’t a substantial archive of Black voices and historical perspectives, and decided to change that. 
“We didn’t have a catalog of African American freedom fighters and social justice warriors,” Richardson said. “And so I sought out to create a collection of these voices, voices of movement — so that we could have an oral history collection here at USC and I decided to start with Rodney King’s family.” 
On March 3, 1991, Rodney King fell victim to an act of police brutality in South Los Angeles, which left him with skull fractures, broken bones and permanent brain damage. Despite video evidence of the incident, all the officers involved were acquitted the next year, and the city erupted with anger. In the riots that occurred in the days following the decision, more than 2,000 people were injured and 50 people died. At only eight years old, Rodney King’s daughter, Lora King, witnessed her father’s beating broadcast throughout the country.
Lora King is the Bass Lab’s first virtual human, marking the Lab’s first foray into interactive media and storytelling. A pop-up at the launch event allowed attendees to “speak” to the AI, trained on responses to questions the Lab had asked her in December. King reflected on her experience with the team, recalling having to take breaks on some of the questions so the team could regain their composure due to the intense nature of her story. 
“I really felt like family,” King said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “[The emotional response of the team] let me know that people are human and they are affected.”
Julia Alexander, a freshman majoring in international relations, attended the event hoping to gain more perspective on the story of Rodney King and his family. 
“I know his story is very powerful,” Alexander said. “So his daughter is very powerful as well.” 
Family members of those involved in racial injustice are often thrown into activism, and Lora King was no exception. Though the interview does include information about King’s activism and foundation, Richardson wanted to ensure that the virtual experience also included information that focuses on humanizing Rodney King and how his family healed from the event.  
“We have a complete collection of the entire court docket surrounding the incidents in 1991 and ‘92, but no interviews from the family, no humanizing elements,” Richardson said. “I thought it was really important to give voice to the families who have walked those incidents and lived that history with him.” 
“I really felt like family. … [The emotional response of the team] let me know that people are human and they are affected.” 
Alexander said she particularly enjoyed seeing and hearing about the family pictures King shared.
“It brought that sense of humanity to him,” Alexander said.  “Seeing him in another way that isn’t displayed in the media was definitely really powerful.”
Richardson said she was grateful to the University for giving her the space to create. The Bass Lab is one of the first of its kind, especially at a predominantly white institution. 
Alexander, a Black woman herself, said she was proud to see the work the Charlotta Bass Lab is doing.
“Trying to focus this attention on the living relatives of victims of police brutality, or just other injustices and those who want social change is definitely something that USC is doing really well, and I think that this foundation is also doing well,” Alexander said. 
Richardson said she hopes to continue curating and preserving the voices of Black pioneers and Black media. 
“I’m so proud that this is at a place like USC,” Richardson said. “We are a top journalism school and top school in communication. At a time when we have entire states that are saying our history doesn’t matter and it has no educational value whatsoever, we have great leadership here at the school who says it does matter.”

They say the beauty of life lies in the details.
For this installment of “The Auracle,” I’d like to take a step out from the Zoltar box to recognize someone I found myself drawn to in my time at USC — my own oracle. I think there’s something very special about thanking the people in our lives and hope that you’ll be spiritually guided to honor these people in your own life.
Throughout my college experience, I’ve felt as if I’m not really there for all the good parts of life, as if my brain can’t handle it. To compensate, I try my best to find joy in the small things in life: the finally-fresh air after a classic Los Angeles downpour, seeing a frat bro fall off their skateboard after being too enraptured in bothering a passerby, a triple shot of blonde espresso over ice.
One of these small — yet undeniable — joys has been the Insomnia Cookies store in the USC Village. Ever since the store first opened on Feb. 26 of last year, I’d make my 2 a.m. trek every night after finishing production in the Daily Trojan newsroom just to grab my daily CookieMagic subscription cookie. More often than not, it’d be a Snickerdoodle, and even more often, one of my favorite employees would be there.
If you’ve ever been to the store, you know which employee I’m talking about. He’s got kind eyes, a friendly demeanor and a wicked grin, the kind that makes your whole day. I’ll never forget the first time he remembered — and dismembered — my order. I had probably walked in half-stumbling from sleep deprivation — oh, the joys of freshman year — and before I even opened my mouth to ask for that dang Snickerdoodle cookie, he interrupted me.
“We’ve got new cookies.”
I stared at him. How dare he break my long-standing tradition of getting a Snickerdoodle cookie? But I decided to entertain that option tonight and ask which one he recommended. “Lemon Poppyseed. Trust me,” he said.
And by god, he was truly deserving of that trust. How dare he. That Lemon Poppyseed cookie marked the beginning of our nightly exchanges. As we began to get to know each other through scattered snippets, our conversations grew in length — much like my belt size from all those pastries he supplied.
In the summer after my freshman year — three months I spent alone in a subleased apartment — he would be the sole human interaction of my day, and those few minutes would make up for a whole day of silence. He’d always ask me how I was, and he’d remember everything I told him. As someone who’s worked in food service for a long time, I understood what it meant to bond with a regular customer. A secret, unspoken acknowledgment of the other’s existence and a slow building of a relationship. And a Blue Ribbon Blueberry cookie.
During the fall, I’d come in far less, and he would ask why while handing me a classic Caramel Apple Pie cookie. I’d answer that life was getting too busy, and he would nod in a knowing, comforting way. Sometimes, I would run into him on his off-hours or see him balancing trays of Starbucks refreshers to bring to his coworkers during his breaks. We’d make eye contact and smile, both of us knowing I’d visit that night for my daily cookie.
This winter, I’d begun to realize that I wasn’t the only one who had been frequenting the store less. When the new Deluxe Filled Hot Cocoa came out, he wasn’t the one to hand me my first one, and I was left wondering how he was doing. When I was lucky and got a chance to see him, I’d cherish those moments — though I’d never be able to tell him.
These days, I’ve gone back to my daily Snickerdoodle. Sure, I’d try out some of the new seasonal flavors, but some of the magic — the CookieMagic, a PR person would say — was gone. Though he was someone I knew virtually nothing about and saw for mere minutes each day, I felt almost indebted to him. These small acts, these details had made my college experience better in an inexplicable way. Tonight was his last night at Insomnia.
Even now, I still feel frozen, stopped in my tracks. This loss, one that not many other people would ever truly understand, was a great one for me.
To that Insomnia employee, thank you for everything. Each night, each seasonal cookie, every hello and goodbye meant so much to me. My nightly Insomnia runs used to be such an inconspicuous detail for me, but you’ve made them the highlight of my day. I hope that the people in the next step of your life will see how truly caring and genuine you are and give you everything you deserve. You’ve been my staple, my Snickerdoodle cookie and I can’t even begin to verbalize the impact your kindness has on each person you meet.
Goodbye, friend.

It’s always baffling how as schooling goes on, seniority in academic course load does not always equate to a higher level of difficulty. Rather, the classes I’ve taken senior year of college provide an outlet for interests I’ve previously left untouched. The content of my upper division electives deviate from the hard-lined structure that my lower required classes had, giving me more wiggle room for exploration. My course schedule is now filled with an array of different subjects that have ranged from Theatrical Film Symposium to a fashion class to a music class — the latter two even applying to my major. The opportunity for greater exploration and freedom is seemingly most present in the essays I’ve been asked to write. 
My WRIT 340 professor told us how in WRIT 150, we learn to write for college through a structure fabricated by those in higher academia. In her class, she countered, she would teach us how to write for life. While I initially believed that to be relevant to the first assignment we ever wrote (an OP-ED!), I realized how important it was to reflect on my past as I worked my way through my third essay in the class: a personal narrative essay. 
In “On Keeping a Notebook,” Joan Didion discussed how writers can’t help but write things down, a compulsion not shared by all. Maybe I’m biased, but this sentiment seems to resonate for most. 
Our presence at this university alone should suffice in proving our ability to write essays, to compute, to be capable of abstract, analytical thought. Reckoning with ourselves, however, is a much bigger task, one that serves us and necessitates undertaking sooner rather than later. 
I mean, I know how to write. I was a voracious reader as a kid. My parents often lovingly reminisced on the days I used to come down for school, spooning cereal into my mouth with one hand and creasing the pages of a book with the other (before those damn iPhones!). I’ve been told by teachers, friends and family alike my whole life that I’m a talented writer, leaving me with quite the ego. An ego I likely wouldn’t feel a compulsion to apologize for if I were a man. But I digress. 
That aforementioned ego, unfortunately, isn’t great at allowing me to feel my emotions to the deepest level. It doesn’t help that I’m a burgeoning comedy writer (The Sack of Troy, hello!) and I often shroud vulnerability with jokes meant to deter people from ever digging deeper into my personality. I’m self-aware to a fault. 
Writing about some of the worst parts of my college experience — caused by some of the worst people I’ve ever met who helped make me into the worst version of myself — was not easy. I was pushed outside of my comfort zone as a writer and as a person. It wasn’t one of my best works as a writer, it wasn’t one of my best grades and I’m pretty sure I forgot some parts of the prompt. But it helped me, at long last, unpack some of the negative experiences I’ve had. 
Opening ourselves up — even if just to a professor’s eyes who we won’t have to properly acknowledge after they see us spill our hearts — offers some sense of catharsis. Writing allows us to reclaim the narratives of our pasts. We can go to therapy and talk to friends, but sometimes there’s only so much we feel we can say. By shouting, or scribbling, into the void, we can find solace in stories that only we know best. 
Writing about my coming of age, the poisonous way I used to speak to myself and the manipulative people who came my way allowed a proper reckoning in a way I don’t think I could have achieved with any other mode of communication. It’s something I’ve also learned to do in my journal. It’s gained purpose aside from recording little details of my day-to-day life that would slip through the cracks if not permanently stored with black ink onto a page. 
I do posit, however, that as writers we shouldn’t have to bare ourselves for a story. As fellow columnist Au Chung described, having to exploit narratives — especially as young people and especially for marginalized communities — is something we feel compelled to do to make stories more emotional. We have become voyeurs of others and thus feel the need to bear ourselves, to exploit our traumatic experiences for content. 
My fellow Sack writers and I often joke about exploiting our lives for content. But not everything must be content, something creatives in Los Angeles don’t always seem to remember. Writing for no audience about some of our vulnerable experiences can provide us a means of processing, of allowing ourselves to be vulnerable, first with ourselves and eventually, one day, others. 
Communication is required by every line of work, something I like to remind ridiculers of the major. Vulnerability, a willingness to advocate for ourselves, to show the ugly parts of ourselves, is one of the greatest communication skills we possess, but too often lack. Through expository writing, especially if for our eyes only, perhaps we stand a chance at regaining it.

Three students participating in the Getty Marrow Undergraduate Internship Program had the opportunity to browse the Getty Museum’s collection and pick a painting that they connected with to write a personal description on. The program provides undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds with the opportunity to gain practical experience in the arts and cultural heritage fields. The descriptions of their paintings were showcased in an exhibition last weekend.
Kymia Freeman, a sophomore majoring in public relations, wrote her description on the 1888 painting “Christ’s Entry into Brussels in 1889” by James Ensor. Freeman said she found the piece “super engaging, physically,” with an apparent loudness and vitality communicated through the artist’s minimal brushwork. This brushwork — or lack thereof — she said, is the way she experienced sensory details.
“I see how some artists will put more detail onto one aspect of a painting … I kind of get the sense [that] this part of the painting is something that the artist really wanted to highlight,” Freeman said. “Just seeing how the central figure of the Jesus statue in the middle of that was really detailed compared to the … disorientation of the other parts of the drawing.”
Elena Prado, a fifth-year majoring in architecture, had a more intimate connection with the 1755 painting “Dandelion” by Barbara Regina Dietzsch, because it featured her favorite flower, the dandelion. The painting depicted two dandelions against a brown background, the seeds blowing away in the wind. 
“You could see each little parachute on the actual dandelions and the tiny little fly in the corner that you wouldn’t notice until you look into it,” Prado said. 
From childhood to adulthood, dandelions have been a big part of Prado’s life. When she goes on walks with her sister, she picks dandelions from the sidewalk and blows the seeds into the breeze. Prado discussed the uncanny sense of displacement that comes with perusing the halls of famous artists’ work and how it can feel like this experience is not for the average onlooker. 
“There’s this weird out of body experience from going where I’m like ‘I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing here,’” Prado said. “So I feel like it was a really positive experience [because] other people might have also had that [same experience].”
Darcy Chung, a junior majoring in art history and business administration, wrote the description for the 1570 painting “A Sheet of Studies with French Roses and an Oxeye Daisy” by Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues. She was thankful that the interns could stray away from the “academic jargon” that is so often seen in museums, so she didn’t have to worry about conveying a historical perspective in her description. 
Chung also has a deep connection with flowers, as her mother and grandmother passed down their interest for gardening through her family’s generations.
“I … immediately connected to it for my own family background, which I thought was really special beyond … looking at it from a more academic perspective,” Chung said. 
In addition to writing descriptions of paintings, students worked in other departments of the Getty — including community outreach and historical site preservation. Freeman worked with the education department, teaching high school students how to be junior gallery guides as part of the Student Gallery Guides program. She enjoyed being the bridge between the “hyper-professional aspect” of the permanent gallery guides and a normal student experience. 
“We work with them on their public speaking skills [on] items in the Getty collection and they literally led tours … all over the center,” Freeman said. 
Chung also worked with the Getty Foundation in the grant department, helping to identify programs that required funding. Students in art conservatories and cultural institutions in Los Angeles and around the world received funding for a wide variety of projects. Some of the projects included presenting Latine art all over museums in Southern California, and another initiative was funded at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, fostering arts news coverage.
“I did a lot of research about those different initiatives that we have … that, as I said, is all about uplifting marginalized groups within the arts community,” Chung said. 
Prado worked at the Getty Conservation Institute, which, along with the building and sites department, identifies cultural heritage sites that need preservation across the local area. This department looks to raise awareness of heritage sites locally and remove the barrier between art and each individual.
“I think people struggle to see that [we’re] still affected [by colonization] today…  It’s built into the way the city is … you look at gated communities, you look at how stores [are absent] in certain [neighborhoods] … it’s geographical differences, but geographical differences rooted in structural racism,” Prado said. “[In] cities like L.A., urban growth is often way more prioritized than historical preservation.” 
After identification, the institute files sites for preservation with the Los Angeles City Planning Department. One of these sites happened to be on Prado’s street. 
“It was one of the first houses [that the] African American Women’s club [used] here in Los Angeles,” she said. “So it helped people who were first coming here so that they could get jobs and housing. It was one of the first Black queer clubs in the United States.”
Prado highlighted how people often lose their identity in a city as diverse as L.A. 
“People will differentiate between [identities] and be like, ‘Oh, that’s not L.A. history, that’s Black history,’” she said. “And it’s like, no, those things are synonymous.” 
Freeman enjoyed being part of the internship program, and said she felt welcomed despite it being her first professional internship and feeling slightly intimidated by the unfamiliar environment. 
“I was treated with so much respect and with so much trust at the Getty that I honestly don’t think I could find anywhere else, and I’m still grateful for [that],” she said.

To quote my former associate managing editor Samantha Stewart after she looked at my entire collection of playlists and saved songs one late night in the newsroom, my taste in music is “so all over the place — just like [my] personality!”
I take this as a great compliment. As a human being, I’m passionate about a whole set of very unrelated interests — with a music taste to match.
While there may be no rhyme or reason for why I like movie scores, Miles Davis, cookie-cutter pop hits, Nas’ entire discography and Beethoven (outside of a library setting) with the same amount of love, I go through the same process with all the music I’ve really loved.
I live my life, and some beautiful sound fills the room. I find it on Spotify, tap a little heart on it. I listen to it 50 times in a row. It infects some old playlists, makes its way into the fabric of my actions for a few days or weeks. I spend time apart from it to remember why I loved it. I return to it after a long while, and then the beautiful part begins: When I finally hear it again, I associate it with that whole segment of my life.
So allow me to share a few stories and songs, all over the place and wildly different, that I love the exact same way. Every last one is linked to strange memories — yet they’re all a part of who I am, what I chase and what I love about life.
“Love Theme From Spartacus” by Yusef Lateef
The first jazz song I’ve ever really loved, I discovered “Love Theme From Spartacus” through a Spotify-generated study playlist that I randomly searched for in my hometown Starbucks during my senior year of high school. Trapped in quarantine and desperate to know where my 26 college applications would take me, I don’t regard that time of my life without painfully remembering the anxiety l felt almost every hour of the day — except when this song came on. It felt like a tonic. To me, it always feels like the clarinet in the song, the volume of which sticks out so distinctly from the low piano and drum sounds humming in the background, was whispering something to me — a message to be patient, that opportunities were coming, that the world I wanted to see, far outside the confines of my teenage bedroom, was about to reveal itself.
It means the same thing to me now. Patience, CJ, good things will come.
“I’LL SEE YOU IN 40” by Joji
After finding Joji on the Twitter trending page, I did a deep dive into his discography and found this gem sitting at the tail end of his “BALLADS 1” album. It’s the only song where I can sincerely enjoy hearing ukulele — and later prompted me to learn how to play it a bit.
It’s one of those moody and reflective songs, perfect for a warm evening drive or your average quarter-life crisis. I’ve spent almost four years taking it with me on some solitary “adventures”: sunset-watching in my car, lying in my dorm bed looking up at a ceiling lit by a cheap disco light or taking the long way on my walk home from work.
“Gonna Fly Now” by Bill Conti
There’s no good explanation for this one, just a word of advice to athletes: The “Rocky” movies have the most motivating soundtracks I’ve ever heard. And you don’t even have to be threatened by Apollo Creed!
“Beat 54 (All Good Now)” by Jungle
This song is where all my happy music memories reside. There’s nothing like hearing its gentle, upbeat melody and getting launched into the nerdy little dance I reserve only for this funk band in the privacy of my home. It feels like opening Blackboard and seeing you got an A on a difficult essay or knowing the person you like feels the same way about you.
Now that’s all good and fine, but wait until you hear how I found it — in the middle of a debilitating bathroom visit in a country club restroom. There’s no greater image than struggling to hold an iPhone to the roof to Shazam a good song while you’re clung to the lid of a gold-plated toilet.
“Nobody” by Nas feat. Ms. Lauryn Hill
My favorite song of all time, I found “Nobody” reading another newspaper — some critic had written how amazing Ms. Lauryn Hill’s feature on Nas’ new album was, and since my discovery, I’ve learned every lyric. I listened to this every day when I studied abroad, when I was truly in “One city, one country, one state / Some place to be nobody.” Exploring a city of millions whose language I didn’t speak, where I learned the true meaning of independence, I was the happiest and most genuine nobody out there. 
And no matter what random piece of sound I’ve decided to become completely obsessed with — whether it makes me happy or sad, or turns me into nobody or somebody — I’ll always find pleasure in that chaos.

The 2000s and 2010s gave us Xavi Hernández and Andrés Iniesta, the original duo who bossed the midfield for both Barcelona and the Spanish National Team. They won everything together — a World Cup, two European Championships, the Champions League (twice) and too many La Liga titles to count. 
Together with Lionel Messi, the Spanish duo dominated matches with their passing, creativity and vision. They recycled play expertly, moving their opponents around with quick combinations before exploding forward to score goal after goal. Ever since Xavi left to finish his career in Qatar in 2015, Barcelona haven’t looked the same. 
Next time you flick on a Barcelona or Spain game, if you’re not paying full attention, it might seem like Xavi and Iniesta are still playing.
Except, Xavi and Iniesta are gone. These young men replicating the iconic partnership are Pedri and Gavi. 
Pedri and Gavi are no longer “hidden gems.” If you follow European soccer, or even if you just watched Spain at the World Cup, you know their names. But they deserve praise right now, because if Barcelona win La Liga, Pedri and Gavi will have won it for them.
While it’s easy to reduce them to a Xavi and Iniesta tribute act, the two young Spaniards are central to what Barcelona have accomplished this season. With Xavi as the team’s manager (who better to learn from?), Barcelona sit in first place in the La Liga table with 53 points after 20 matches played. If they continue on their current pace of 2.65 points per game, Barcelona will finish with around 100 points in La Liga. Considering the club’s myriad issues on and off the pitch in recent seasons, a turnaround of this magnitude in Xavi’s first full season is extraordinary. 
In 26 La Liga and Champions League matches, Pedri has started 22 games and appeared off the bench in three more. Gavi has started 19 and was substituted in a further six times. Remember, Pedri is just 20 years old and Gavi turned 18 shortly before the season began. For two players this young to have this much responsibility on any team is ludicrous, much less for the likely champions of Spain.
Xavi has empowered his team to dominate the ball, in classic Barcelona fashion. But the La Blaugrana don’t hold the ball for no purpose. Xavi has implemented Pep Guardiola-esque concepts to supercharge Barcelona’s attack. Guardiola coached Xavi during their epic run from 2008-2012 and has turned Manchester City into the best possession-based team in world football. 
Without Pedri and Gavi, Xavi would be unable to execute his vision. Gavi has the skillset of a midfielder, but recently Xavi has employed him higher up the pitch, nominally as a left winger in a 4-3-3 formation. Except, Gavi does not hug the left touchline in attack like a traditional winger. 
The teenager occupies a position just in front of the opposition’s back line, with left-back Jordi Alba to the outside and striker Robert Lewandowski in the central area. That allows Gavi to receive the ball with space in a dangerous area and turn in either direction. He has the option to pass outside to Alba, who can cross the ball high or low, or feed Lewandowski through the middle. 
Gavi can dribble effectively as well. At 5-foot-8, he has a low center of gravity and relishes the opportunity to push forward with the ball at his feet. According to FBref, he averages 2.11 progressive carries and 1.47 successful take-ons per match. The take-ons number is particularly impressive, ranking 93rd percentile among Europe’s top leagues. 
As effective as Gavi has been as a forward, his future should lie in the midfield. His positional versatility allows Xavi to experiment and surprise opponents, but ultimately Gavi has the instincts of a midfielder, not the pure goal-scoring instinct Barcelona needs on the wing to eventually become Champions League contenders. 
Pedri can also play out wide from time to time, but ever since he made his Barça debut at 17 years old, Pedri has become one of Europe’s most dangerous midfield facilitators. He is a complete player who contributes in all areas of the pitch. Pedri plays alongside Sergio Busquets, Barcelona’s elder statesman in midfield, but has more license to push forward and contribute directly to goals. 
Despite starting in a deeper position than Gavi, Pedri produces more shot-creating action than Gavi, with 4.17 per match. That puts him in the top 5% of the most aggressively-attacking midfielders in Europe. Pedri creates these opportunities using his elite patience and vision. 
Pedri likes to sit back, playing a few passes back-and-forth with Busquets or another midfield teammate to move an opposing defender out of position, before exploding forward into the box when the space opens up in front of him. When charging forward, he can play a one-two with a Barcelona forward, either passing to a player in a position to shoot or testing the goalkeeper himself. 
Both players have well-rounded skillsets. Both can score and create. Both have already proven central to Barcelona and the Spanish National Team. They started all four of Spain’s matches at the World Cup in Qatar. 
Xavi and Iniesta did not play in the same Barcelona team until Iniesta was 18 and Xavi was 22. Having first played together at 16 and 18, Gavi and Pedri already have a head start. 
It would be incredulous if they managed to win more trophies than Xavi and Iniesta did, but at their current pace, Gavi and Pedri’s careers will be just as illustrious.

The No. 24 women’s tennis team will hit the road this weekend to take on UC Santa Barbara as they look to avenge last season’s loss.
The Trojans enter this weekend’s dual following a 6-1 loss to No. 1 Texas last Saturday. The Trojans’ lone point in the contest came on court one from No. 2-ranked freshman Madison Sieg, who defeated Nicole Khirin in three sets. 
“It was definitely a tough match for us,” Sieg said. “We went in wanting to do better, I think, but all of us came out with a new motivation to do even better, to work even harder.”
However, the Trojans were able to keep the match closer than the scoreboard indicated.
“Of course, any time we play a team ranked No. 1 in the country, we want to show exactly what we can do. I think there were some courts we were able to do that on, some courts we were really close on … and we’re excited about that,” said Head Coach Alison Swain. “I think we are also really hungry to play another match against a ranked opponent to really show what we can do.”
Now, the Trojans will look to generate momentum in their match against the Guanchos after going 1-2 over the past two weekends — including a loss against unranked Notre Dame in the ITA Kickoff tournament in Georgia.
“One of our big goals this year is to have a better record in doubles so we can go into more of our [singles] matches with that doubles point in hand,” Swain said. “I don’t think a lot has to change here, we are on the right path and we just are ready for more matches, more opportunities and to take advantage of those opportunities.”
The Trojans are looking to double down on the details to capitalize on their chances moving forward.
“Every single time we are out there we play really close, no matter what the score is,” Sieg said. “We are just really paying attention to working hard and figuring those small things out.”
The Trojans’ match in Santa Barbara will be their last dual in a four-match road trip before they return to home court. 
“It’s part of what we do. It’s good for us to get out on the road,”  Swain said. “I think our team, both getting to play at home which is really comfortable for us, and facing some adversity on the road, it’s all really important to prepare for postseason play.”
The Gauchos are 1-3 so far this season and enter the dual riding a three-game losing streak that includes losses to No. 12 UC BerkeleyCal, No. 15 Auburn and No. 19 Arizona State. The last time the Trojans faced the Gauchos, they fell in a surprise home loss.
“We love redemption matches. I think girls are really focused on this weekend,” Swain said. “We are focusing on being physical on court and taking charge of the big moments and big points to build momentum, both individually on our courts and as a team. ” 
The Trojans’ match against Santa Barbara is one of their last matches before they begin Pac-12 play, with Washington State coming up for a March 3 match on the road. The Trojans are 5-2 so far this season.
“The mentality going into Pac-12 season is let’s take advantage of each match and stay in the moment of the match we’re playing,” Swain said. “Not getting ahead of ourselves, not having a weekend where we are playing somebody and we are looking ahead to playing the higher-ranked team.”
Still, the Trojans remain undaunted by the matches ahead.
“We are really trying to just grow our confidence,” Sieg said. “We know that we have a tough schedule ahead of us, but we also know that we are more than capable of handling it.”
The Trojans will face the Gauchos Sunday at 12 p.m. at Arnhold Tennis Center in Santa Barbara.

“Sorry, Bro” — a heartfelt, charming rom-com debut by Armenian American author Taleen Voskuni — merges the traditional aspects of Armenian culture with the modern world to tell the story of a queer Armenian woman coming into her own, while also falling in love.  
The story follows Nareh Bedrossian, or Nar, an Armenian American woman living in San Francisco who has just turned down the marriage proposal of her non-Armenian boyfriend. Nar is unfulfilled — she makes decisions to please her family, her boss does not take her seriously as a reporter and she feels hopelessly disconnected from her culture. As a newly single woman, Nar’s mother pressures her to attend Explore Armenia, a month-long series of events that include activities such as Armenian cooking lessons, dancing and brandy tasting, in order to meet potential suitors and hopefully a good Armenian husband.
However, Nar soon realizes that her interests may lie more with her wingwoman, Erebuni, and must wrestle with the implications of her developing crush, especially since she is not out as bisexual to her family. Voskuni delves into the stigma of queerness within the Armenian community through Nar’s inner conflict. Nar must decide whether to please her family and maintain appearances or follow the love that her heart desires. As Nar grows more comfortable with her Armenian identity, she also begins to grow into her queerness, begging the question of whether the two can coexist. 
Throughout the novel, Voskuni makes the assertion that there is a way to be immersed in one’s culture while also staying true to one’s identity. Nar’s struggle with integrating these important aspects of her identity is contrasted with Erebuni’s calm, seamless merging of these factors, thus illustrating that a perfect balance is possible. Nar’s navigation of her relationship with Erebuni forces her to think about what she wants for once, rather than defaulting to what her family may desire.
Voskuni integrates the beautiful, unique parts of Armenian culture by highlighting the importance that their foods, language and symbols hold. Every chapter begins with an Armenian proverb, in both English and Armenian, along with page borders of pomegranates — an Armenian symbol for fertility and abundance. Through Nar’s reintroduction to the many aspects of her culture, it becomes apparent that Voskuni’s “Sorry, Bro” not only functions as a queer rom-com, but also as a love letter to the Armenian heritage. 
The setting and characters of the novel allow for Voskuni to fully immerse the reader into an Armenian American world, thus giving insight into the practices, traditions and values of the community. She asserts the importance of family and matriarchs within the Armenian sphere and the closeness of a diaspora community that is determined to stay true to its heritage. 
Voskuni jokes about Armenian tendencies and experiences, such as always being late to events, the prevalence of rugs in households and hearing one’s Armenian name being butchered by odars, or non-Armenians. The levity and seamless way in which Voskuni weaves in cultural details in “Sorry, Bro” allows one to feel the experiences of the characters and the influence that their heritage has on them. 
“Sorry, Bro” brings attention to the idea of queer Armenian joy — a foreign concept in literature that centers Armenian stories. Voskuni discusses the shadow that the Armenian genocide has cast upon the Armenian existence, which is apparent both in the narrative world she has created and in reality. 
Most stories centering Armenians are placed against the backdrop of the genocide, such as “The Promise” or “The Sandcastle Girls.” Voskuni’s romantic comedy contrasts this as the story wholly unfolds in modern-day San Francisco. However, despite the playfulness of the setting, Voskuni does not ignore the impact that the genocide has had on the Armenian people. As illustrated throughout the novel, she demonstrates that there can be a balance between honoring the past and living in the present. 
Voskuni centers Nar, a character lost in her identity and knocked off balance, to bring light to the complicated existence of an Armenian struggling to connect with her culture’s history, people and expectations. Through the help of Erebuni, Nar learns more about the importance of honoring her history, while also finding ways to integrate it with her modern world. 
Voskuni breathes new life into the rom-com genre by presenting San Francisco and Nar’s world through an Armenian lens. She deals with the burden that many first generation individuals feel when attempting to grow into themselves, while also maintaining the status quo of their respective immigrant communities. 
In “Sorry, Bro,” Nar learns how to shrug off the safety nets she has had socially, familially and professionally in order to grow as an individual, while also falling in love in the process. The warmth, expertise, complexity and care with which Voskuni presents Nar’s growth within her cultural sphere, along with the natural, enjoyable progression of the storyline make it a five-star read.
