I’m not typically a fan of doing this, but I want to invite you all on the bandwagon to witness a chance at greatness.
This team isn’t led by a well-known face like Matt Barkley or Steve Johnson, and it hasn’t won a championship in more than 20 years, so don’t expect any four-peats.
On top · Though the Trojans have not won a title since 1990, senior middleblocker Steven Shandrick has fans believing 2012 could be special. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
But I promise they’re a truly  special unit.
Of course, I am talking about the No. 1-ranked men’s volleyball team in the land, the Trojans, who, over the past two months, have rattled off 15 straight match wins with ease.
They’ve won in new gyms, old gyms, at home, on the road, against lesser foes and against some of the elite teams. All of this has occurred without a single bat of an eye or a collective round of applause from us, the student body.
Most of you love to hoot and holler every Saturday in the fall at the Coliseum, regardless of whether the words “interception” or “face mask penalty” are a part of your vocabulary. Even this spring, as the baseball team has resurfaced from its five-plus years of hibernation, people have come to Dedeaux Field.
Yet, right before our very eyes is a team that has transformed from the hunted to the hunter, from a 5-4 squad to a group that at the moment looks unbeatable, and we’ve all grown apathetic to their success. It’s as if we’ve become so spoiled by this university’s athletic success that we can afford to take a season off from some sports, even if one is on the cusp of bringing another banner back to Heritage Hall.
I’m calling your bluff because frankly I don’t want you to miss out on a team that personifies the very word.
I’m not expecting you to recite National Player of the Year candidate senior Tony Ciarelli’s 2012 résumé of feats, or appreciate the on-court presence of floor general and middle blocker senior Steve Shandrick or even recognize a beautiful assist by freshman setter Micah Christenson from a game-altering block by freshman Robert Feathers.
My only wish is that beginning April 21, when the team returns home to host what surely will be a long run through the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference and NCAA tournaments, you’ll come along for the ride.
If you’re sick of hearing a columnist rant about this team, look no further than their world-class coach, Bill Ferguson.
For a man who is enjoying what is arguably his greatest year at USC, he too cannot get enough of this team.
“I’ve always said this is one of the more enjoyable groups I’ve had since coming here,” Ferguson said. “They just get it and take care of the little things really well. They have the right amount of fun and there are some good personalities on this team, but what makes them great is they know how to move on to the next assignment or team so well. Sometimes as a coach you have to ingrain that into guys, but that hasn’t been the case with this bunch.”
The truth of the matter is, whether facing an opponent such as UC Irvine or UCLA, or playing in front of 5,000 or five, the team really doesn’t care.
Even with all the distractions that come with being a student-athlete on a campus like USC, these guys could care less about the attention. They are high-character individuals, on the court and off, who play not to get their names in a column or to get thousands of fans cheering for them. They play because of the love they have for their sport and the player standing next to them.
Most of them couldn’t tell you when postseason play officially starts or name half the teams they’ve beaten during their remarkable streak to the top. But that’s what’s incredible about them.
To get 20 young men to care about one thing and one thing only, at this level, is nearly impossible.
But that’s what Ferguson and company have done.
These last two months have been special, even awe-inspiring at points, yet none of it matters as I write these words.
It’s not about the journey of days past for these Trojans; it’s about accomplishing what’s on the schedule for today.
It sounds cliché, almost too simple and too naïve to work. But how do you come up with a convincing argument against a 15-game win streak by a bunch of guys who are playing less like a collection of players on a team, and more like a family?
You don’t.
Instead, you learn to embrace the mindset. You learn to appreciate what they’re doing and how they’re doing it. You learn that just like the other widely successful programs on campus, this one is also worth your time.
If you don’t know the sport, still show up. If you know the sport and aren’t a fan, give it a second chance. And if you’ve been cheering since day one, you deserve a standing ovation from all of us.
This team is yours, mine and ours. It’s about time we start acting like it and join the family before the train leaves the station for good.

So proud of this team! Not only are they are wonderful athletes, but they are also great people. My cousin is among them, and I couldn’t be prouder :)
This team is extraordinary and yet so humble in its success.  People, please wake up to the beauty of this sport, which requires not only athleticism, power and speed but also pinpoint accuracy and skill.  It’s a wonderful sport, played by fantastic Trojan athletes.  The only thing missing is the crowd.
great article, Dave…
as an ex volleyballer (so to speak…MGR 74-76) and following this group since the heady freshman days of 2009 when they surprised everyone to last year’s taken for granted they would win but couldn’t match up to a hyped up UCSB  Gaucho squad (they wree our bane back in the early 70’s also)…twice, no less.
This group has jelled into a savvy squad of youth and experience (altho those youths are experienced as any)…
Let’s hope their mindset sends them to the finals at the Galen center…what better way to end the year?!
Fight On!

Impressive plays by the defense and the team’s persistent injury bug stood out in USC’s penultimate  practice before the spring game Saturday.
The quarterback group as a whole threw four interceptions. Starter senior Matt Barkley threw two picks, with senior safety Jawanza Starling and redshirt sophomore cornerback Anthony Brown each returning one of Barkley’s throws for touchdowns.
ω
The decision by the coaching staff to start sophomore Aundrey Walker over redshirt junior Kevin Graf at left tackle is still reverberating. After allowing redshirt sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard to run past him on multiple plays in practice, Graf seemed a bit shaken.
“I’m going out there and doing what coach is asking me to do,” Graf said.
ω
Walker sounded excited about his new role and opportunity on the line after playing on special teams in 2011.
“I have to get my plays and package down,” said Walker. “Last year I played but I didn’t. Now I’m excited and trying to know my plays inside and out.”
After sophomore running back sophomore Tre Madden tore his left ligament and was lost for the season last Thursday, the focus has been on redshirt freshman tailback Buck Allen. After Allen looked a little lost in Saturday’s scrimmage, USC coach Lane Kiffin noted his improvement.
“He was mentally prepared to go out and play for the whole time,” Kiffin said.
Allen busted out a couple of runs almost as proof of his successful adjustment.
ω
Though redshirt sophomore tight end Randall Telfer and sophomore wideout George Farmer returned from injuries, Farmer was limited to team drills as the persistent problem with having healthy pass-catchers on the Trojans’ roster is continuing to keep the coaching staff up at night.
“It’s hard on the quarterback and the coaches,” said Kiffin about the injured receiver and tight end cores. “We’re going to kids who I don’t think ever played high school football. They came out here because they saw a brochure floating around somewhere in their English class. It’s really tough.”
ω
While the situation hopefully improves as players become healthy over the summer, Kiffin is still light-hearted about the unfortunate injury bug among Barkley’s targets.
“[New wide receivers coach] Tee Martin is ready to go back to Kentucky,” he jested.
Jacob Freedman – Before you report about a player you should get your facts straight. Pullard did not get around Graf, so why should he be shaken up about something that didn’t happen?

The kings of comeback struck again at Dedeaux Field on Tuesday night,  but it wasn’t enough to give this time.
After a weekend series with California that featured two walkoff victories, USC treated the fans in attendance at the team’s battle with cross town rival Loyola Marymount to another thriller. Trailing 4-2 in the ninth, the Trojans scored two runs off Lions reliever Aaron Griffin to tie the game, before ultimately falling by a final score of 8-5 in 12 innings.
Tough outting · Freshman pitcher Nigel Nootbaar pitched only 3.2 innings in Tuesday’s game against Loyola Marymount. He gave up two earned runs and struck out three batters in the contest. - Adrian Hoffman | Daily Trojan
The Lions forged ahead in the 12th inning, taking advantage of a throwing error by freshman second baseman Dante Flores. With freshman David Edwards on second base following the error and a sacrifice, Mitchell Esser singled to right center to put LMU ahead for good.
The visiting Lions added three insurance runs after Flores’ second throwing error of the inning to close out the Lion’s scoring. J.R. Aguirre closed out the scoring with an RBI single in the bottom half of the 12th.
USC struck first in the second inning. Sophomore catcher Jake Hernandez reached on an error to lead off, and advanced to second on a single by sophomore third baseman Kevin Swick. A groundout put runners at second and third for sophomore second baseman James Roberts, whose infield single plated Hernandez for a 1-0 Trojan lead.
But they got another in the third. Senior right fielder Garret Houts was hit to lead off the inning and advanced to second on a groudout. After stealing third, Houts scored on another infield single, this one by senior first baseman Matt Foat, to put USC up 2-0.
Freshman pitcher Nigel Nootbaar started the game on the mound for the Trojans, the first start of his career and tossed three impressive scoreless innings.  Nootbaar came out to start the fourth inning and struck out the first two hitters but was lifted after giving up a single and a double to put runners on second and third. Sophomore James Guillen was brought in and promptly gave up a two-RBI single to tie the game.
With senior Brandon Garcia on the mound in the top of the seventh, the Lions put two on with one out courtesy of a single and a walk. Loyola Marymount right fielder Tanner Donnels singles to vault the Lions to a 3-2 lead, their first of the game.
Then, on a double steal attempt, Hernandez got up ready to throw to third, and then changed his mind to second at the last instant. But his hand smacked against the bat, causing the ball to sail into right field and allowing another run to score on an error to put the Trojans in a 4-2 hole.
USC embarks on a road trip beginning with a three-game series against Arizona State.

Highlighting construction projects that will take place on campus over the next several years, Kristina Raspe, vice president for Real Estate Development and Asset Management, led a discussion about the progress and future of the USC Master Plan.
The USC Master Plan took four years to develop, culminating with its approval by the city of Los Angeles in 2009. USC had not developed a major reconstruction plan since 1960.
Report · Kristina Raspe, vice president for Real Estate Development and Asset Management, led a discussion Monday about the Master Plan. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
“We’ve grown in a thoughtful way since 1960, but we haven’t really projected our growth for the next 20 to 30 years, so this was a big deal to us,” Raspe said. “Since we’ve completed the Master Plan in 2009, we’ve been going through the city process to approve the proposed construction and there will be a final hearing before the city council in August.”
Raspe said current and future building projects include new academic facilities of the School of Cinematic Arts and the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, an instructional building for the Marshall School of Business and a shared research facility for the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
In addition to creating various new academic buildings, the Master Plan will supplement other aspects of student life such as athletics, Raspe said.
“The John McKay Center will have a lot of space underground for athlete training,” Raspe said. “The university athletic facility was surprisingly behind, despite the caliber of our athletics, and so this project will help us keep up with our peers for our recruiting standpoint.”
Raspe said The Village at USC construction plan is being treated as a separate project from the capital Master Plan, with the first phase projected to begin May 2013 and to take 27 months to complete.
The ultimate goal of the 35-acre renovation of the University Village is to create more student housing, Raspe said.
“There is not enough housing that is appropriate quality or appropriately priced for our students,” Raspe said. “For us to continue to compete for the best and brightest students, the quality of student housing will be a part of this. The creation of the projected 5,200 new students beds will have an impact on rent in the area and will significantly decrease rent.”
The ongoing renovation plans will make USC a more attractive university for current and prospective students, said Amy Rasplicka, a sophomore studying business administration.
“I’m very impressed, and the plan was very well-thought through,” Rasplicka said. “I was excited to hear about the projects on campus in general and know that it will improve student life for those who are here or want to come here.”
Though some community groups have opposed the plan, many believe the construction project will improve the community overall, said Peter Enzminger, a graduate student studying policy, planning and development.
“I do know that there are community groups opposed to the plans,” Enzminger said. “There is a sentiment that the space will only be for the on-campus student community. [South Los Angeles] lacks a lot of the shopping, retail and employment that could be found in other parts of Los Angeles.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary on Monday, April 9.
Crimes against a person
At 2:51 p.m., a student reported that a suspect groped her crotch while she was standing in a crowd during an event at McCarthy Quad. The student did not report the incident at the time it occurred, so DPS officers were unable to conduct a search for the suspect.
At 10:15 a.m., a student reported that a non-USC male grabbed him by the throat and pinned him to the ground in an effort to detain him for police after he was observed kicking the side view mirror of his boyfriend’s vehicle. The student managed to escape before the police arrived and stated that he was considering pressing charges against the male, but he changed his mind after being counseled by DPS officers. The student also stated that he intended to pay for the damage to the vehicle.
Crimes against property
At 7:35 p.m., a suspect entered an apartment at University Gateway Apartments during a party and removed an unattended laptop computer.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:03 p.m., Transportation Services personnel immobilized a non-USC male’s vehicle displaying an altered USC parking permit in Parking Structure D. The male contacted the Transportation Services office, agreed to pay all fees and fines and his vehicle was released.
At 9:38 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of two juveniles panhandling at Wendy’s and detained them for investigation. The officers determined that the juveniles were truant from school, then they transported the subjects to the campus and released them into the custody of an LAUSD police officer.

The Viterbi School of Engineering’s satellite program received permission last week to launch the Aeneas satellite into space. The launch will take place within the next two months.
The USC Information Sciences Institute and the USC Space Engineering Research Center worked together on the satellite mission. The Aeneas spacecraft, a nanosatellite, has been completed and has passed all integration tests.
Researchers are hoping to prove that low-power communication is possible from a satellite in space.
Dan Erwin, professor and chair of the Department of Astronautical Engineering, said the research has a practical, commercial application.
“The idea is that you can do real surveillance and communication with very small, cheap satellites,” Erwin said. “We’re trying to make space more accessible for many applications.”
Researchers plan to use their findings to track cargo containers traveling on ships through a Department of Homeland Security program.
The program is launching the satellite from the Falcon vehicle by SpaceX. Erwin said that companies, such as SpaceX, donate the excess space on their spacecraft to projects like Aeneas.
Many research universities already have established programs that launch spacecraft, but Erwin said USC’s program, which works with smaller spacecraft, is unique because it provides students with hands-on experience and the ability to see a project from start to finish.
“The main engineers on the program are students,” Erwin said. “It’s very exciting to be able to go from the very beginning to seeing a spacecraft launched and in orbit while still a student.”
This CubeSat will be launched on the Atlas V vehicle by United Launch Alliance.

Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences announced last week the start of an experimental online survey, which polls L.A. residents’ opinions on political issues and candidates.
The online poll is based on the success of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll, a cooperative phone survey undertaken three years ago by the Los Angeles Times and Dornsife College experts to gauge public opinion. Unlike the phone poll, however, the new online experiment will ask for in-depth answers to political questions independent of the Los Angeles Times.
Dan Schnur, director of the new poll and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said online polling reflects a cultural shift regarding technology that can better anticipate accurate poll results.
“Just as more people now communicate by text message or email than phone calls, we believe the future of public opinion polling will take place online,” Schnur said. “We tremendously value the current USC Dornsife political poll and will continue to operate with that poll in the future, yet we believe it is important to experiment with this new poll as well.”
Though the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll is limited to asking voters yes-or-no questions, the online poll allows for increased feedback in the form of follow-up questions. Voters in the experimental poll who previously could only voice their support or opposition of candidates are now able to give reasons for their positions.
Two California public opinion firms are conducting the online poll. Schnur said to prevent bias, one of the firms hired, M4 Strategies, is a Republican firm, and the other, Tulchin Research, is a Democrat firm.
The previous USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times phone poll was among the most successful in accurately predicting the results of the last presidential election, Schnur said. The original poll is still being operated, and in the coming weeks, analysts will compare results of the telephone poll to its online counterpart.
Schnur said the project has helped bring credibility and publicity to the university.
“The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll has brought tremendous visibility to the university,” Schnur said. “The survey receives more attention in the mainstream news media than any other subject related to USC.“
USC now receives more non-sports news coverage by mainstream media than any other university in the nation besides Harvard, Schnur said.
USC students will also take part in analysis of the poll’s results.
“Students have always been able to participate in the analysis and discussion of phone surveys. It’s our goal to give students the same opportunity with the online poll.”

The Keck Medical Center of USC opened a new medical office in Pasadena, Calif., making the facility USC’s largest specialty physician office outside of the Health Sciences Campus in East Los Angeles.
Members of the Trojan Family, physicians and the mayor of Pasadena celebrated the opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony, reception and tours of the office Tuesday.

The 22,000-square-foot center will house more than 40 USC faculty physicians, who represent more than 15 specialties, including ophthalmology, oncology, neurology, surgery services and cardiovascular services, said Scott Evans, chief operating officer and interim chief executive officer of Keck Hospital of USC and USC Norris Cancer Hospital.
“It was always our hope that we could bring a real, world-class academic center into the communities where our patients live and work,” Evans said.
Two licensed hospitals serve the center, including the Keck Hospital of USC on the west side and the Norris Cancer Hospital on the east side, which Evans said provides a great opportunity to bring comprehensive, well-respected cancer care to more patients.
“We’re a tertiary provider of cancer care, which means we see the sickest of the sick and the toughest of the tough cases, but more often than not, we’d like to do that in the comfort of one’s community if possible,” Evans said. “We have a large patient base that comes from Pasadena already, so this is really going to serve as a convenient place for them.”
At its peak, the center is capable of serving about 400 patients a day, Evans said. An on-site infusion center, including a pharmacy and laboratory, is available to patients, in addition to discounted on-site parking.
Tom Jackiewicz, senior vice president and chief executive officer of USC Health, said the new center exemplifies the goal of Keck Medical Center to expand its high-quality, advanced care beyond the Health Sciences Campus.
“This space is absolutely fantastic,” Jackiewicz said. “I mean this really shows what we can do as an organization, and this is the kind of state-of-the-art clinical space that our organization needs and deserves. It also represents the expansion and growth and dedication to create a network of care throughout the entire region.”

Pasadena has a population of about 140,000 people, and employs about 100,000, said Mayor Bill Bogaard. The services available at the new center will benefit the city and people in many important ways, he said.
“It gives us the bragging rights about the quality of services that are available in Pasadena,” said Bogaard, who has served as Pasadena’s mayor since 1999. “It’s a matter of offering quality services to the people of this region, and it strengthens Pasadena as an economic enterprise.”
Bogaard said he is proud to have USC Keck physicians in Pasadena and will provide his services to smooth their transition to the city.
“I am grateful to the USC Keck School, to the physicians who have come here and will be practicing,” Bogaard said. “I hope that everything that can be done to facilitate that transition of the doctors and to make this comfortable move for them and for their patients can be accomplished with the help from City Hall.”
The new Pasadena center is USC’s fourth satellite office in the region, and is located at the Huntington Pavilion on the fourth floor of 625 S. Fair Oaks Ave., Ste. 400 in Pasadena. USC physicians also practice at medical centers in La Cañada Flintridge, Beverly Hills and Downtown Los Angeles.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia discussed his philosophy of Constitutional originalism and how it can be applied to modern cases at the Gould School of Law’s 2012 Justice Lester W. Roth Lecture on Tuesday.
Scalia explained originalism as interpreting the Constitution as the framers intended it, instead of reading new meaning into the document.

His ideological opponents believe the Constitution is a living document that changes over time to reflect an evolving society.
“The living Constitution — I hate it,” Scalia said. “The enduring Constitution, that is what I’m defending.”
One of the key pieces of logic behind his philosophy, Scalia said, is that scholars don’t read new meaning into the text of other historical documents or pieces of literature.
“When we read Shakespeare, we have a glossary,” Scalia said. “We don’t think the words have changed there, so why do we think they have changed in the Constitution?”
The Justice, however, said he sees why his opponents wish to believe the Constitution can change.
“It’s a very seductive philosophy,” Scalia said. “It’s wonderful to think whatever you are passionate about — abortion, the death penalty, homosexual sodomy — is in the Constitution.”
Though that perspective can be tempting, it would distort the objectivity of the Supreme Court, he said.
“If you find what the original meaning of the Constitution is, I am handcuffed,” Scalia said. “I cannot do the nasty conservative things I would like to do to the people.”
A loose interpretation of the law is a recent phenomenon, Scalia said. He said this philosophy allowed justices starting with the Warren Court to tamper with the meaning of the law while still appearing objective.
“In the old days, they distorted the Constitution in the good old-fashioned way — they lied about it,” Scalia said.
While few lawyers or judges have as strong of a view of originalism as Scalia, many said his beliefs have still made an impact on the profession.
“There is no other justice who has had as much influence on the way we lawyers see the law,” Dean Robert Rasmussen of the Gould School of Law said.
Students also said hearing Scalia defend his school of thought in person was a valuable experience.
“I don’t necessarily agree with him, but it was great to hear about originalism from one of the leaders of that school of thought,” law student Danielle Warner said.
Not all students in the audience, however, had such a positive viewpoint.
“I think it is troubling to have such a rigid, black and white perspective on issues, especially for someone who is supposed to be inherently objective,” law student Blanca Hernandez said.
Despite some disagreement with Scalia’s strong beliefs, most appreciated the opportunity to hear from such a prominent figure.
“It’s really cool USC Gould School of Law attracts Supreme Court justices, but at the same time he makes it sound so easy,” law student Ryan McDonald said.
Though many may disagree with his philosophy, Scalia said he remains a strong originalist because of what is really important: protecting the meaning of the Constitution.
“What’s the use of adopting a Bill of Rights if it doesn’t mean anything except what future generations want it to mean?” Scalia said.
The Constitution provides a mechanism for changing with the times. Don’t like what it says? Update it through the amendment process. Don’t usurp its meaning through unprincipled reinterpretation.
If minorities are regarded as subhuman and no longer considered “persons” by future generations, would equal protection of persons (as connoted by its previous meaning) no longer extend to them?
your theories are delightfully crackpot, and i wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
If minorities are regarded by the majority as subhuman and not considered “persons” by future majorities, can they “update” the constitution through the amendment process? Or, is the bill of rights specifically there to protect the inherent rights of minorities, regardless of what majorities may or may not want to “update” in the future?  Because if it’s the latter, then of course the Const has to be reinterpreted as we face situations the framers never dreamed of.
“‘I think it is troubling to have such a rigid, black and white perspective on issues, especially for someone who is supposed to be inherently objective,’ law student Blanca Hernandez said.”
Yeah! He could be way more objective if he was wishy-washy and let his personal feelings guide him. Oh, wait…
Homosexual sodomy?  Did Scalia have to take a time machine to USC from the nineteenth century?
Nice ending quote.

What’s the restaurant industry to do when all of the — sometimes literal — smoke and mirrors on the plate no longer impress jaded diners?
The answer, it seems, involves the cocktail. Once an afterthought of the dining experience, most restaurants now give cocktails as much care as meals.
At Bar Centro at José Andrés’ restaurant The Bazaar, drinks are poured tableside with chilly clouds of liquid nitrogen. And at Downtown’s craft-cocktail speakeasy The Varnish, the most popular drinks come not from a set-in-stone menu but from the mind of the bartender, who will specialize a cocktail to one’s preferences and the best ingredients on hand.
All across America, cities are seeing the rise of cocktail culture.
The James Beard Foundation began awarding restaurants with its highly coveted medals in 1991. But 2012 marks the first year a category has been added for the most outstanding bar program. The nominees hail from Chicago, New York and San Francisco.
Excuse the rhyme, but it seems we’ve become a libation nation.
The invasion of craft cocktails on the L.A. restaurant scene is surprising only in that it hasn’t happened sooner. This is, after all, the city that pioneered — or at least popularized — a nationwide produce-driven food movement.
The cocktail craze has thrived by piggybacking off of that movement. Library Bar, at Hollywood’s Roosevelt Hotel, bases its menu on ingredients found at farmer’s markets, and Lucques’ Moscow Margarita features tiny flecks of beet floating in the drink: Moscow in title, yes, but Southern California in spirit. Where else would one find roasted root vegetables in their tequila?
Across the street inside Comme Ça is 18A, one of the original bar programs to give the L.A. cocktail scene a boost. Cocktails requiring citrus, like the fruity Beachcomber, use only the freshest juices — so, of course, the 18A menu is seasonal.
With craft cocktails, every detail counts. As it should, if a drink costs more than an appetizer — and in some cases, a meal — then it should be crafted with as much, if not more, care.
Even the ice is important. Many bars ignore standard icemakers in favor of handcrafted options. At Drink, a Boston bar that helped jumpstart the cocktail revolution, bartenders chip away at ice blocks to create precise shapes and types of ice for each drink.
For most, though, it’s easier to use an ice ball, a perfect, frozen sphere that is known to stay whole rather than melt and water the drink down.
The Muji Silicon Ice Ball Maker, available on the company’s website, is one tool used to create great ice. The acquisition of such a machine, silly as it seems, can turn a cupboard of mismatched glasses and cheap alcohol into a veritable home bar.
For the college student, this purchase might seem impractical. But adding care to cocktails is nothing to scoff at. College students are wont to drink heavily; a simple ice ball maker will make this drinking, in some part, respectable.
Think of it this way: To respect a cocktail is to respect alcohol as well, an attitude from which many college students would do well to benefit.
And though this newfound cocktail culture can seem serious, it is, above all, about fun.
That’s why so many bars have looked to the past, taking Prohibition-era inspiration to create experiences that reflect that period’s sense of giddy rebellion.
The Varnish resides past an unassuming door in the back of Cole’s French Dip restaurant. And at a similar speakeasy-style bar in New York, Please Don’t Tell, one is required to walk through a phone booth to find the bar.
The book Vintage Cocktails, a spiral-bound ode to White Russians and Mai Tais, details cocktails at their most fun. It’s also an excellent reference for the home bar: The recipes are not too complicated, and the large, glossy pictures are as much a delight to look at as they are to replicate.
The book also features some lesser-known drinks to discover. The pousse-café, a drink of apricot brandy, grenadine, various cacao liquors and crème de menthe, requires careful pouring but results in a perfectly layered drink with stripe upon stripe of eye-popping red, green, blue and orange.
Fancy as it can appear, this new wave of conscientious drinking shouldn’t prompt an upturned nose at drinking from red Solo cups. That’s not really the point.
Cocktail culture exists as a celebration of alcohol and fresh ingredients, as an interest seriously fun and funnily serious. And that pomp doesn’t always have to mean multi-layered, multi-colored creations. It can be as simple as bringing together muddled mint, a favorite liquor and fresh juice, shaken not stirred.
As with all things in life, it’s not complication one should aim for. It’s taste.

A metropolitan masterpiece that delights from beginning to end, writer-director Whit Stillman’s Damsels in Distress is utterly charming.
After a far-too-long hiatus from the big screen following 1998’s The Last Days of Disco, Stillman proves with Damsels that his ability to concoct quirky characters and exquisitely witty, articulate dialogue is as strong and impressive as ever.
Offbeat · Greta Gerwig (left) and Adam Brody (right) star in Whit Stillman’s oddball work Damsels in Distress, an atypical college film that stands out with its whimsical score, fresh talent and brilliant writing. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
The flick, starring indie darling Greta Gerwig, adorably eccentric former America’s Next Top Model contestant Analeigh Tipton and teen heartthrob Adam Brody, fuses whimsical Woody Allen-esque style with atypical college campus humor in a meticulously crafted, offbeat story of self-discovery.
Set at a fictional East Coast college, Damsels in Distress tells the tale of a dynamic trio of girls, led by the tenacious Violet (Gerwig), who sets out to cure the male-dominated student body of its low standards of living, boorish ways and foul odors.
The trio takes the naive and innocent new student Lily (Tipton) under its wing to guide her through the harrowing world of college and introduce her to the group’s crusade to rescue fellow students from their own self-destruction.
The girls’ philanthropic outlook on life manifests in their operation of the university’s “Suicide Center,” where they prescribe donuts, coffee and tap-dancing as remedies of distraction for severely depressed and suicidal students.
Gradually, Lily comes to accept Violet’s wacky ways as fact, especially Violet’s adamant belief that the key to thriving socially and romantically is to seek a significant other who is “frankly inferior” to oneself so that one may truly help their lesser counterpart realize their full potential.
Violet’s dogma, beliefs and entire calculated persona come crashing down, however, when her “not conventionally attractive,” dim-witted, frat-boy boyfriend Frank (Ryan Metcalf) cheats on her with another girl, forcing her into a self-described “tailspin” that makes her and her loyal followers re-evaluate everything they so confidently thought they knew about life, love and how to make it in contemporary society.
Though the plot might ostensibly seem like a cliché caricature of college life, the truly intelligent dialogue and delightfully idiosyncratic characters elevate the story beyond conventional campus humor.
The vast majority of the striking verbiage comes from Violet, the irrefutable commanding star of the film whose straight-faced absurdities and outlandish suppositions somehow come across as authentic, truthful and entirely plausible — a feat that can only be achieved by the masterful writing of Stillman and the total dedication of Gerwig.
Violet’s lofty and downright peculiar ambitions — most notably her adamant resolve to start a new dance craze, which she claims is the “sort of thing that changes the course of human history” — are cinematic gold as they rally the unknowing audience in support of a non-existent cause.
But the unwavering dedication from Gerwig and the supporting cast members to embody Violet’s ambitions as absolute truth manages to garner audience favor to the extent that it really does not matter what the audience is rooting for, so long as they are rooting with Violet.
Tipton also shines as the fresh-faced and lost Lily whose naïveté and unformed perceptions of college make for the perfect blank canvas on which Violet can paint her perfectly crafted dogma.
Tipton’s unconventional and youthful beauty makes her the ideal choice to win the affections of fellow students Charlie (Brody) and Xavier (Gossip Girl ’s Hugo Becker) in what amounts to a perplexing romantic entanglement that pushes the boundary of conventional college relationships, dealing with controversial issues that dance on the brink of taboo.
Though Stillman’s screenplay undoubtedly brings brilliance and sophistication to the film — as an homage to the power of words — the cinematography and music bring the story to life.
The light and lively soundtrack lends a whimsical quality, while the feminine and airy color palette brings an ethereal feel to the piece, almost as if the picture were enhanced by one of Instagram’s trademark photo effects.
The unique and irrefutably odd plot, characters and ambience make the film more of a niche piece than a satisfying mainstream comedy, but the popularity of Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris testifies to the increasing popularity of this distinctive metropolitan genre.
In his director’s statement, Stillman reinforces the key role that the word “tailspin” plays in the film, comparing the many characters’ gradual yet unmistakable unraveling with a plane spiraling downward, nose-first, toward Earth.
“Just as pilots use steep dives to build speed and regain control, our heroine finds downward velocity reforming her life,” Stillman said. “But in steep descent one cannot be sure a fatal crash will be avoided.”
This eccentric metaphor flawlessly parallels the overall feel and tone of this distinctly Stillman, offbeat piece that is every bit as moving, hilarious and downright delightful as it is peculiar and unexpected.

Coffee: Somewhere along the line, the bitter black beverage went from simple drink to national sensation. In fact, more than 150 million Americans consume coffee every day, contributing to a domestic coffee market that banks $18 billion each year.
And since the coffee/espresso revolution of the late ’90s, coffee has grown to mean more than just a cup of decent drip from the corner store — it’s an obsession, boasting a multifaceted universe of varietals, brewing methods, drink types and flavors. Even if you’re not entirely passionate about coffee, the drink’s finer points are worth considering, especially in light of the fact that even a basic latte can go for more than $3 in Los Angeles.
With that in mind, it’s equally important to know where to go. Unfortunately, more often than not, coffee shops fail to deliver on quality, despite relatively high prices.
USC’s campus flaunts a wide array of places to grab coffee, but only a few serve consistently quality drinks. The biggest problem: the crowds. The lines at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at both the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the School of Cinematic Arts buildings, for instance, can extend perilously far during peak hours. Not only do these crowds create long waits, they also create a difficult scenario for baristas, who often rush through making your drink — and don’t focus on quality execution — in order to get to the next order.
It’s usually a better situation at locations across the street from campus, such as Starbucks at the University Village or Seattle’s Best at Gateway. These coffee shops make decent, if not noteworthy, espresso drinks, and their brewed coffee tends to be fresher and more flavorful than the coffee at places like Trojan Grounds.
The title of “best coffee on campus,” however, still goes to Shop Café, tucked away in the courtyard of the School of Architecture. As long as one avoids the lunch-break rush, the cafe is a veritable haven of coffee drinks. The gritty details are impressive: Shop Café uses the products of Pasadena-based roaster Jones Coffee, which features beans from the highly touted Guatemalan estate Finca Dos Marias. The shop also indulges customers with pricier, and also tastier, Monin-brand flavor syrups.
Most crucially, the cafe’s gleaming La Marzocco machines brew a punchy espresso with a luscious, tiger-striped layer of crema — the all-important microfoam, laced with the extracted essential oils of coffee, that sits on the surface of a shot and gives good espresso its nuance. The quality — or lack thereof — of an espresso shot can make or break an espresso drink.
The same goes for steamed milk. Sounds simple, right? You take some whole milk, stick it under a wand that shoots out searingly hot steam, wait till the liquid froths up and mix it with espresso: Voilà, a latte. Except it’s not so easy to do well — many espresso drinks arrive with milk that’s scalded and lacking body and froth that looks more like something from a bubble bath gone terribly awry, all drooping suds instead of thick, luxurious foam.
Thankfully, Shop Café’s espresso drinks consistently come with all the elements in proper form, resulting in a beverage with an assertive, deep coffee flavor mingling perfectly with silky, thick milk that retains its natural sweetness.
Off campus, options for great coffee abound. There are the “classic” temples of haute caffeine, most notably the notoriously hip Intelligentsia Coffee as well as Groundwork Coffee, both of which feature dedicated baristas who turn out some intense drinks.
Another gem closer to campus is Café Dulcé at the Japanese Village Plaza. The bakery and coffee shop offers many incredibly tasty things to try, including a rich, perfectly cold-brewed iced coffee and a heart-stoppingly delicious bacon-glazed donut.
The true winner, however, is the Dulcé Latte — a brilliantly devised latte that’s boosted with a dose of condensed milk, steamed together with whole milk. It’s one of the ultimate expressions of a latte: The milk is made even thicker and more velveteen with the condensed milk, and the drink carries the perfect undercurrent of sweet, caramel-like flavor.
If espresso drinks aren’t your thing, there’s still the world of brewed coffee to look into. Unlike espresso, which can rarely be made well at home without a professional machine, brewed coffee is best done at home, where each cup can be made fresh. As it happens, though, too many people are used to throwing Folger’s into a janky, ancient drip-coffee brewer.
Instead, try a French press. A simple device made of a glass container and a plunger attachment with a steel-mesh filter, the humble French press can turn out some of the most revelatory brewed coffee you’ll ever have, with a dense body and layers upon layer of complex flavor. All that’s needed is some fresh, nicely roasted coffee and the press itself, which often runs around only $20 at stores like Target. Make sure to buy your coffee in whole-bean form and get it ground fresh, either at the store or at a nearby supermarket’s bulk grinder or, best of all, at home.
Bad coffee is an everyday reality, whether it’s sipping on the final dregs of that workplace brew that’s been sitting around for hours or receiving a terrible drink from a chain coffeeshop. But good coffee isn’t that difficult to find — it just requires a little effort, whether it’s hunting past the corner Starbucks or simply investing 10 minutes each morning at home.
Yum! I love coffee! Iced coffee is great for the weather we’ve been having. I usually just brew my own though since it’s a lot more convenient and you don’t have to drive to the cafe.

Homelessness is a very difficult problem to combat and one that raises many different reactions.
To some, the homeless are seen as people stuck in a cyclical system caused by mistakes or sheer bad luck.
To others, the homeless symbolize a lazy resistance because of their inactivity and inability to find jobs, exacerbated by drug use and criminality. Thus, when issues of homelessness are discussed they are usually met with strong opinions, both opposed and in favor. This is the central issue in the recent argument over the Los Angeles County housing authority’s recent regulation changes relating to housing assistance.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Under the Section 8 program, the housing authority has 22,000 vouchers for government subsidized housing to give out based on a waiting list. But 510 of those vouchers are set aside for individuals who are case-managed by community-based groups and referred to the housing authority as being in need of housing assistance. The homeless are one beneficiary of this addendum.
In addition, a ban was lifted against homeless probationers and parolees. The program also saw a reduction in the amount of time an eligible individual cannot have been involved in a serious crime, from three to two years. The measure passed 4-1 in a vote of Los Angeles County supervisors last week, and it has received strong support for its predicted help in getting homeless people off the streets.
There is, however, a strong movement against the changes, as they are considered by some to be unfair.
The opposition cites that the waiting list for Section 8 housing assistance has 191,000 people on it, and these changes essentially make it possible to jump the line by being a homeless ex-convict. If one such individual is selected, they argue, he or she could jump ahead of people who have waited years for this aid.
It’s a very hard issue to sort out. On one side there are the homeless who might have committed crimes and up until this point had no chance to take advantage of this aid. On the other side, there are those who have waited years for the aid and run the risk of having to wait another year because there are only 21,490 vouchers available to them instead of the full 22,000. They are groups that have suffered great hardships and both need help.
These changes are not implemented to cause hardship to those that have been patiently waiting in line. Rather, the changes serve to help those in dire need, such as the homeless who could not have received this aid before. The 510 reserved spots existed before these changes, so the total number of vouchers available for the people waiting has, in turn, not changed as well.
It might cause some anger to think that these people are able to jump them in line by being ex-convicts. Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, the only supervisor who voted against the changes, said that the policy “sends the wrong message — commit a crime, receive Section 8 housing.”
These people are looking at the changes in the wrong light. The regulations do not mean that you can somehow benefit from committing a crime. If you do, it will only delay the process further.
The number remains at 510, so the impact cannot be that widespread, and the presence of the community programs means that not just anyone will be selected for the aid. It is not a means to jump the line by committing a crime, but rather one of forgiving past offenses and allowing a select group of people the semblance of a second chance.
Being in the middle of a large city like Los Angeles, USC is not removed from the issue of homelessness. There are usually homeless individuals outside of campus who cannot be avoided. Despite the complete disconnect between the lives of these people and the life of the average USC student, these people are still, after all, people. And not only that, they are members of the community. It is of high importance for these issues to be recognized and considered, despite the alien nature of them to our own daily lives.

Excellent article, thank you for treating people fairly.
Thanks for responding to this issue in an educated way. Not only is this a compassionate response, it is the most economical as well. 
We can choose not to offer them this support, but that will only mean they spend countless nights every year in other costly public systems (ER’s, jails, etc). 
It is important for our public investments to be principled and cost-effective, and this change accomplishes both. Thanks for drawing light to this important issue.
Any homeless family with childeren should get those vouchers on a temp basis. Any single adult who has committed a violent felony is on their own. Any able bodied person with no kids who won’t work…NOTHING!

H.R.4170 would help ease student loan burdens.
In 2012, student loan debt surpassed credit card debt. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates that $1 trillion is owed in student debt. Students attending college have to pay for tuition, standard fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation and daily living expenses. Full-time students attending a private four-year university such as USC can pay up to $57,876 when including total cost of attendance.
On March 8, H.R.4170, known as the Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012, was introduced to the House of Representatives by Rep. Hansen Clarke of the 13th district of Michigan. The purpose of the act, according to Open Congress, is to “increase purchasing power, strengthen economic recovery and restore fairness in financing higher education in the United States through student loan forgiveness, caps on interest rates on federal student loans, and refinancing opportunities for private borrowers, and for other purposes.”
According to Clarke, there are currently student loan forgiveness programs aimed at specific fields such as teaching, medical, nursing and mental health professions that have strict guidelines.
H.R.4170 would cover federal student loans and private student loans if the borrower’s adjusted income is equal to or less than their education debt. It would also cap the federal interest rate from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. The bill creates a 10-10 standard, which would give borrowers the opportunity to make payments of 10 percent of their income for 10 years, and would eliminate the remaining debt. It would reduce the current Public Service Loan from 10 years to five years. Borrowers who are in default would be eligible to enroll in the Income Based Repayment Plan. Finally, borrowers who have paid 10 percent of their discretionary income totaling 120 payments for the past 10 years would immediately qualify if the bill becomes law.
If the bill is passed it would increase the ability of student borrowers to pay off their student loans that would ultimately help them purchase a home, invest in business, afford the cost of living, afford healthcare and not declare bankruptcy. The bill would help borrowers who have fallen behind on their debt because of unforeseen circumstances, such as illness, unemployment, family separation or a death in the family.
It is time for our policymakers to invest in the future of young, educated Americans who can build and stimulate a strong economy.

On Easter this last Sunday, if you’re Christian, you might have marked the occasion with traditional choral music. Or if you’re especially unorthodox, perhaps you listened to some Christian Rock. Here, in honor of the recent holiday, are four great songs about Jesus that you will never hear on Easter.
Sufjan Stevens—”The Transfiguration“
Sufjan Stevens’ recent releases often criticize faith. “All Delighted People,” for example, is almost nihilistic. Back in the day, however, Stevens’ work was full to bursting with Jesus. “The Transfiguration” recounts an episode from the Bible prophesying the Resurrection, closing with the lines, “Lost in the cloud, a sign: son of man, son of God!”
St. Vincent—”Jesus Saves, I Spend“
Anne Erin Clark (a.k.a. St. Vincent) toured for years backing Sufjan Stevens before she became a musical act herself (i.e., as St. Vincent). We might speculate that “Jesus Saves, I Spend” mocks Stevens’ religiosity, and specifically his rapid rise to commercial success via that religiosity.
Neutral Milk Hotel—”King of Carrot Flowers, Pts. 2 & 3“
This song may or may not have anything to do with Jesus. It merited inclusion on this list with its opening lines: “I love you Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ I love you, yes I do.” Neutral Milk may be using “Jesus Christ” as an exclamation, in which case the song would be aimed at an audience other than Jesus (i.e., meaning “Jesus Christ—I love you” rather than “I love you: Jesus Christ”). But considering the apocalyptic tone of the song’s other lyrics, this is probably in fact for J.C.
Kanye West—”Jesus Walks (NSFW)“
This song is really more about racism and Chi-town hardship than it is about Jesus. It is about West finding comfort in faith, even amid a bedlam of war and poverty. Over and over he pleads, “God show me the way because the devil’s trying to break me down,” and his meaning is two-fold. West is pleading salvation not just from sin but also from faithlessness, i.e., from that meaningless chaos into which his violent world threatens to descend.
