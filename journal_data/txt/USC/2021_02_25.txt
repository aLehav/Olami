Tuesday marked the semesterly meeting of the Trojan Council, this time focusing on racial equity, consisting of leadership in Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments, Staff Assembly and the Academic Senate, joined by President Carol Folt and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp. Founded in 2017, the council aims to bring student voices and concerns to University leadership in formal discussion.
The most recent Trojan Council meeting was smoother than the last one, according to USG Vice President Trinity Moore in an interview with the Daily Trojan. This was the first meeting to feature a presentation, and Moore said there were more plans and tangible goals involved. “Last semester, I think some of the participants were a little frustrated that some of their questions weren’t being addressed or that they weren’t being answered.”
The meeting opened with a statement by Folt about the disruptive changes of the past year, from the protests following police brutality to the removal of the former University President Rufus von KleinSmid’s name and bust from the University Center for International and Public Affairs building. Folt also addressed the recent work of the USC Department of Public Safety Community Advisory Board, which compiled listening sessions of over 700 participants.
“In the summer, we probably had what is one of the most important social movements to have taken place in recent years … It was a call, a time for us to confront anti-Blackness and systemic racism,” Folt said. “It’s been at the top of all of our minds.”
In the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, USC created a task force dedicated to promoting racial equality at the University called REDI, or Racial Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.
Folt appointed Christopher Manning as chief inclusion and diversity officer. Manning, hired as a part of the equity efforts spearheaded by REDI, is the first person to hold the position, according to Folt. During the forum, Manning briefly went over his goals to promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion when he officially starts his post March 1. 
“I really want to have a lot of one-on-one conversations with students, staff, faculty, shared governance leaders, as well as senior executives, to engage in a situational diagnosis of the state of DEI at USC,” Manning said. “I’d like to try to begin identifying some high yield opportunities to get off the ground quickly.” 
Following Manning, Manuel Pastor, REDI co-chair and distinguished professor of sociology and American studies & ethnicity, spoke briefly about the upcoming 45 to 50 page report outlining “what should be done” about diversity, equity and inclusion at USC. 
A majority of the meeting consisted of a presentation on REDI’s action plan for ameliorating racial disparities in both faculty and students moving forward. The presentation, given by co-chairs Pastor and Senior Vice President of Human Resources Felicia Washington, covered upcoming department requirements to increase transparency in their evaluations of merit in promoting and retaining faculty and staff to investing in research on diversity, inclusion and equity. 
“When you look at [our] staff, you can also see that there’s some decreased diversity in staff workforce that’s occurred over time,” Washington said. “The reasons for some early departures of newly employed staff include the lack of professionalism of the managers and supervisors, a lack of professional development and also the perceived lack of demonstrated care about the staff member’s career projection.” 
The presentation concluded with a summary of REDI’s overarching themes, which outlined a general plan to “create systems of transparency” and reexamine potentially racist systems and practices, as well as providing more funding for DEI cultural centers. 
“We understand that this will cost money,” Pastor said. “We think that in order to do that, be worthwhile and actually find a market to launch a bold and ambitious campaign for equity. I think to do that, we need to facilitate racial equity work with the Board of Trustees, in the school level, with courts and counselors.” 
The latter half of the meeting was open to student and faculty questions, submitted via the chat function in Zoom and open to all participants.
The questions were primarily answered by Washington, Manning and Folt.
One faculty member asked what USC plans to do regarding USC staff workers, many of which are working class and Black and Indigenous people and people of color, who are currently unemployed due to coronavirus-related layoffs. 
Washington addressed the context of the question, acknowledging that staff employees unable to work since March of last year were either laid off or reduced to an unpaid status late December. 
“Over 90% of these employees are in situations such that they have the ability and a right to be recalled within 18 months … One of the things the University has done is open the employee support fund to these employees,” she said. 
There were no comments on future plans to help currently unemployed workers. 
Katie Orban, a graduate student studying molecular biology and public policy, said that Black and Indigenous students and students of color are typically of lower income and are less likely to be involved in unpaid research. Orbain asked if there was a plan to provide funding to enable students of color to participate.
“Lower income [students and] students of color frequently have tremendous family responsibilities,” Pastor added. 
“That’s a big issue in Dornsife,” Folt said. “They are out trying to raise tens of millions of dollars for that very important set of opportunities for our students.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Orban said that experience has told her that the ambition of REDI should be carefully watched. 
“From my experience, there’s very lofty goals attached to issues of diversity, equity and inclusion. They’re often very well intentioned,” Orban said. “Also, very often, once diversity, equity and inclusion issues are no longer in the forefront of everyone’s minds, they also fail to be at the forefront of university policy.” 
Orban wasn’t the only one who had doubts about the task force. Another faculty member asked if REDI was going to put aside academic performance standards in order to hire someone on the basis of their membership in a specific community. 
“That’s a caricature of a position,” Pastor responded. “I don’t think that we’re saying, ‘Let’s put blinders on around scholarly attributes’… We are wasting some really big opportunities out there to diversify our faculty and increase our research productivity to drive in new money through strategic advantages.” 
The event ended, with the panel having answered a handful of concerns from both faculty and students on USC’s plans for addressing racial disparities within their administration, faculty and staff.  
“I’m really hoping that we get meaningful change,” Orban said. “I think it will be interesting to see if this attitude towards making things more diverse, equitable and inclusive trickles down from University administration to different departments.”

Enrique Perez’s initial reaction to the news of USC’s plans to return to in-person classes for the Fall 2021 semester was one of elation, before he was quickly overcome with a sense of skepticism. 
“I was very excited about it because, of course, an in-person experience is better than being online,” Perez said. “However, I’m a bit worried that the University isn’t planning for the worst-case scenario — since that has been the case for the previous two semesters.”
In a communitywide email Friday, President Carol Folt announced that the University is planning for a full return to in-person classes and residential life for the Fall 2021 semester. Folt also announced some preventative measures that will be implemented to prepare for students’ return, including a campuswide vaccination rollout, continued twice-weekly testing for all undergraduate students and physical distancing measures for classrooms and other facilities. 
Perez, a freshman majoring in electrical and computer engineering, has been living in an on-campus dorm this semester after staying at home last semester. As an international student from Mexico, he moved on-campus in order to get paid for his research job this semester. 
Folt also announced that while classes are likely to remain entirely online this spring, the University plans to reopen other facilities throughout the rest of this semester. 
“I really am looking forward to recreational facilities such as the track or basketball court or other facilities to be open so I am able to spend more time outdoors while still feeling safe,” Perez said.
Matt Chen, a freshman majoring in gender and sexuality studies, has spent his entire first year at home doing classes from his childhood bedroom in Westfield, New Jersey, and remains skeptical of Folt’s announcement. 
“My hesitation is that one, it’s February, and return to campus is six months away and so much could happen in that time … and also the fact that this has happened twice before where they said we’re planning to return to campus and then we haven’t,” Chen said. 
However, Chen said he feels “lucky to have three more years” to enjoy USC. Before he moves back to campus, Chen said he’d want the University to take certain health precautions. 
“Ideally, we’ll all be vaccinated … that would make me feel very comfortable returning to campus,” Chen said. “And I do believe that USC … will have or already has the infrastructure in place to conduct wide-scale testing and quarantine if need be.”
However, other students were more optimistic about the prospect of an in-person fall semester after Folt’s announcement. 
“Unlike last fall’s … optimism about returning to campus, I think that just how COVID is going and the vaccine rollout. I think that it’s more likely that we actually will return to campus in comparison to last year’s [announcements]” said Jonathon Lin, a junior majoring in environmental studies. “I was excited to see [the announcement] because I think it will happen.”
Lin says that although he felt more focused at home for the past semester and a half and saw improvements in his academic performance, he looks forward to finding off-campus housing in the Los Angeles area next semester. 
“ I see in the news that every state is really capitalizing off of the vaccines they have and president [Joe Biden] just bought a lot more, so that … all adults can take the vaccine,” Lin said. “So, I think, at the rate it’s going, I think things should be safe by the summer.”
For Cat Birkenfeld, a sophomore majoring in psychology and NGOs and social change, ensuring that the University is actively looking after its neighboring community when in-person life resumes is her top priority. 
“It’s really important to remember to remind ourselves that we’re guests in a home, and that … there’s a significant population of homeless people here,and there’s large populations of Black and brown people, and those are the groups that have been disproportionately affected by the really awful parts of COVID,” Birkenfeld said. “We have to recognize, as a University, that we have a really important social responsibility here, that it’s not just about us as individuals.” 
In her email, Folt gave no exact timeline for the reopening of campus facilities this semester. She also announced plans for a possible hybrid commencement ceremony for both the class of 2021 and class of 2020. According to her email, an update will be given in mid-March. 
“I think that’s a generous offer, and I wouldn’t be able to say how I feel about it because it wasn’t my graduation to miss, but I think it’s very generous that [Folt] offered it, or that the planning includes it,” Lin said. “I hope that seniors will get the graduation they want.”

With the wide distribution of coronavirus vaccines and the implementation of rules for masks and social distancing, the United States has seen a significant decrease in coronavirus cases. This achievement brings hope to businesses and schools that are beginning to make plans to reopen and return to normal. 
Across the country, states and cities are gradually making a recovery. Los Angeles is projecting a more positive forecast for the upcoming spring — as businesses such as restaurants, nail salons and barber shops reopen with limited capacity — and colleges including USC and UCLA have announced plans to bring students back to campus for the upcoming fall semester. 
However, it has taken the country a significant amount of sacrifice to recover. As of Feb. 22, the coronavirus death toll has surpassed 500,000 in the U.S., which accounts for 20% of the world’s total coronavirus-related deaths. The rising number of deaths has caused people to treat the issue seriously and pushed local governments to enact stricter social distancing roles. However, as people are starting to see a slow down in thecoronavirus’s spread, there are still many reasons for people to keep vigilant about the pandemic.
Currently, health officials are suggesting people remain cautious about the pandemic. In a recent press conference, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, indicated that researchers have not collected enough data to confirm whether vaccinated individuals will spread the virus to unvaccinated people. As a result, people who have received their vaccinations should still avoid indoor dining or going to theaters and places where people congregate. 
People should also be wary of new variants of the coronavirus. Since vaccines may not be completely effective against these new strains, and vaccine companies still need to make adjustments, the variants actually pose a potential threat to people regardless of whether or not they have been vaccinated. Different states have already reported discovery of coronavirus mutation. In Southern California, a coronavirus virus variant named CAL.20C may be drastically more infectious than the typical coronavirus strain . Moreover, researchers also discovered seven new coronavirus variants in the country and are worried that these variants will be more contagious than the previous ones. 
In the meantime, the coronavirus variants found in South Africa and the U.K. are also causing more infections in the United States and may lead to a potential rise in confirmed cases. The new variant from the U.K. is 50% more contagious than the previous ones and has been found in at least 20 states. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has projected that this new strain could constitute more than half of the new infections in the United States by March. 
Although the United States is striving to provide more vaccinations and adjust them to protect people from the new variants, it will take some time for the country’s vaccination program to cover the majority of its people. In this case, it is necessary for people, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, to take sufficient precautions and protections. Face masks will continue to be the necessary personal protective equipment for everyone. Dr. Fauci has estimated that people may need to keep wearing masks until 2022. He also advised people to keep distanced seating during outdoor events such as sports. 
The CDC has also asked people to keep taking preventive measures against the coronavirus in its guidelines updated in February. The measures include washing hands with sanitizers regularly, avoiding direct contact with eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and covering coughs and sneezes. When people are in public places, they are advised to follow social distancing protocols, stay at least six feet apart (two arms length) from others and avoid crowds and places without sufficient ventilation. 
USC students must also keep wearing masks on campus, even after the school reopens for the fall semester. It is also necessary for students to limit the number of people attending indoor and outdoor partying and try to keep social distance from others at large gatherings.
The threats of the coronavirus are still imminent, and the United States has only just reached its turning point. The future course of the country depends on its people’s actions, so it is imperative for everyone to be vigilant about the coronavirus, continue taking precautions and protect themselves and those around them.

Students from engineering, cinema and communication fields filled the seats of Annenberg Hall in Mike Annany and Colin Maclay’s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism class “Media, Algorithms, and Platform Publics: Exploring dynamics of design, creation, and practice.” Annany and Maclay created the class in 2017 with an intent to explore the interdisciplinary nature of the digital world. Once the class came to an end, its versatile energy left students and faculty itching for more. 
“At the end of the class there was actually this moment where everybody was like ‘Well, we don’t want this class to end, so what do we do?’” said Annany, an assistant professor at Annenberg. 
This desire inspired Ananny and Maclay, the latter a professor and executive director of the Annenberg Innovation Lab, to transform the class’ framework into a research group collective, MASTS, that meets weekly on Tuesday afternoons. MASTS stands for Media as SocioTechnical Systems and represents the bridge between media, technology and social issues. Each week, a member of the group presents about an aspect of technology that interests them. 
“There’s been a range of topics,” said Adrienne Adams, a graduate student studying American studies and ethnicity and a member of MASTS. “The last few weeks we’ve been thinking about platform governance … coming up I will be speaking about 20th century technology, like faxing, the printer and things like that.” 
No matter who starts the discussion, every member has a chance to give their insight and share their perspectives on the issue. Bita Tanavoli, a junior majoring in communication, said that after the presenters explain their topic, there is a whole group discussion that lasts about an hour. Tanavoli also added that the discussions are “very engaging and dynamic.”
Members of MASTS can also use the space to explore topics they might want to eventually discuss outside of the group, Annany said. When someone is planning on presenting at an academic workshop or conference, they can test their ideas in a meeting. 
“There’s upcoming [academic workshops and] conferences, where students want to, kind of like test drive presentations or projects that they might take about at those conferences,” Annany said. “Our weekly meetings become places to kind of rehearse or figure out what that topic looks like for them or what a project looks like.”
Over the summer, the surge of Black Lives Matter protests evoked a shift in the undertones of some of the topics MASTS discussed at the time, Annany said. 
“Very quickly, a lot of the work had a stronger social justice framework to it,” Ananny said. “Questions of [sociotechnical systems] often have questions of race, and social justice and inequality baked into how they’re designed or how they’re deployed or how money is made off of them. A lot of the group really had a strong social justice and specifically racial justice component to their work where we ask, how do these technologies see people?”
Adams said they focus a lot on Black studies, transgender studies and technology in their classes at USC. MASTS is a perfect place for them to put all of these aspects together. 
“It’s kind of this no pressure environment to learn more about things I might have exposure to or work out ideas that I’m thinking about in terms of how Blackness and transness inform the ways that we think about and utilize communication and information technologies,” Adams said.
Because of the coronavirus, MASTS is currently meeting over Zoom. However, the virtual setting has not stopped the group from creating a sense of camaraderie and building close connections, Ananny said. As a first year doctoral student at USC, Adams joined MASTS in October after searching for a way to meet students with similar interests, such as the large role of technology in society. 
“I think my favorite thing has been … just getting to know people from so many other departments,” Adams said. “There’s former postdocs who are now professors, there are people from cinema, media studies, there’s people from my own department — Annenberg —and there seems to be this really dynamic approach every time we have a conversation because there’s so many different backgrounds.”
Ananny echoed Adams’ feelings towards the group, especially since he was unsure whether the group’s connection would be as rich as if the meetings were in person. 
“People wanted to keep meeting,” Annany said. “The attendance of the meetings went up over the summer, it went up in the fall. This feeling of, ‘Oh, people are becoming disconnected,’ if anything we saw the exact opposite. People were craving the interdisciplinary community that had motivated us at the very beginning.”
In the coming weeks, the group will be focusing on background infrastructures, such as transit systems and Bluetooth. Ananny looks for MASTS to expand this semester to include more people from various disciplines at USC. 
For Tanavoli, she looks forward to continuing learning from the diverse perspectives of the group.
“For now, I’ve been having a great time just listening and learning and getting to know new people,” Tanavoli said.

Among the various sports teams, student organizations and chapters of Greek life at USC, there is a relatively unrecognized community of system-impacted students who are negatively affected by the incarceration of a loved one and have suffered from and persevered in the hands of the prison system.
With mass incarceration sweeping the nation, it is no surprise that students at USC feel its devastating effects as well. Results from an anonymous survey conducted over a two-week period show that out of a pool of 127 USC students, 20.5% of them have a family member that has been incarcerated at one point in their lives, while 11% of students have a close friend that has served time in prison at one time or another. Currently, 8.7% of students have a friend or family member currently incarcerated, with 15% being arrested in California and 14.4% being convicted in the last five years.
While the survey results show that many participants have had an incarcerated loved one, these statistics of systems-impacted students are a small representation of a much larger picture. The United States is the leading country in incarceration worldwide, housing up to 25% of the world’s incarcerated population between federal and state prisons and local jails. Currently, there are 2.3 million people incarcerated in the United States, which is a 700% increase since 1970. 
Mass incarceration is a societal problem as much as it is a systemic one. While there are many policies that contribute to this, we as a society can do better to understand this monumental issue and demand policy change on behalf of those behind bars. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, by passing policies that reduce or eliminate sentencing for nonviolent offenders, strengthening and streamlining alternative programs and increasing transparency, accountability and transitionary programs, we can move closer to ending mass incarceration. 
While a substantial amount of the prison population is incarcerated due to felony charges, many are in jails awaiting trial for a crime they haven’t been convicted of yet. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, there are over 600,000 people that are held in local jails who have not been proven guilty or convicted of crime and may very well be innocent, yet are wasting valuable time incarcerated because they cannot afford a cash bail or adequate defense. Trials can be extended weeks, months and even years. Eliminating cash bail would be a step forward in ending mass incarceration by reducing the population of people who are not serving a mandated prison sentence.
Others are serving time as a result of the three-strikes rule, mandatory minimums or outdated crime policies from the “tough on crime” era. Occasionally, new repeals of these laws that are meant to reduce incarceration are not made retroactive, which neglects those who have been impacted by older laws and who have suffered for a longer time.
Mass incarceration disproportionately affects Black and Latinx communities. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, one in three Black men can expect to serve time in prison at one point of their lives, and one in six Latino men can expect the same, as police notoriously patrol communities of color where there is also less community resources. Additionally, the Sentencing Project reported that people of color makeup 37% of the U.S. population yet 67% of the incarcerated population. 
Implicit racial bias, sentencing policies and socioeconomic barriers contribute to mass incarceration of Black and Latinx communities, yet they benefit white people whose cases will not be hindered by racial bias.
Some anonymous survey takers chose to leave comments about their loved ones’ convictions.
“She was convicted for a bunch of drug related crimes,” an anonymous participant wrote. “She is out now and has a worse addiction than before. She also served three years longer than she was sentenced for fighting and such.”            
According to the Bureau of Prisons, the most common cause of conviction is a drug-related charge, which makes up 46% of the incarcerated population. However, with such populous prisons, officials are rarely able to offer incarcerated people the resources they need for rehabilitation. In light of a 67.8% recidivism rate within the first three months of release, the effectiveness of prison resources is highly disputed. There are about 50,000 federal, state and local legal restrictions that make it difficult for former incarcerees to reintegrate back into society, such as strict probation standards and mandatory disclosure ofcriminal records to potential employers.     
“My brother-in-law, convicted at age 19, has been incarcerated for five years and has 11 more to go,” another anonymous participant wrote. “My cousin, also convicted at age 19, has been incarcerated for 15 years with 18 more to go.”
Currently, 78.1% of the federal prison population is serving a sentence greater than five years, with 2.9% of the population serving a life sentence. 
Another participant wrote that the cause of their loved one’s incarceration was linked to mental illness. Before their conviction, many incarcerated people have low socioeconomic status, little to no education and have been diagnosed with a mental illness. With a number of mental health institutions shutting down since the 1970s, approximately 40,000 to 72,000 people in prisons who would likely have been in mental hospitals in the past are now being given criminal sentences. The rates of mental illness are high among the incarcerated population, with a 64% mental illness diagnosis rate in county jails, 54% in state prisons and 45% in federal prisons.
Mass incarceration costs taxpayers $80 billion annually. Since 1980, California has built 23 prisons and one University of California campus. 
“Although no one in my family has faced incarceration, I know quite a few friends who have family members who are mass incarcerated,” another anonymous participant wrote.
With 2.3 million people serving time in the U.S. prison system, many people, places and policies are affected by mass incarceration. Millions of people behind bars must adapt their lives to the daily constraints prison systems bring. Systems-impacted families and friends must bear with the ineffable devastation of having their loved ones locked in cages far away from them, only to be acknowledged by their inmate ID number.
There is a need for societal awareness of the causes for mass incarceration and support for change necessary. If more people understand the link between incarceration and race, poverty, mental health and lack of resources, then we will have a better roadmap as a society.

Major League Baseball has a glaring problem that needs to be addressed: its competitive balance. The Los Angeles Dodgers appear to be approaching an era of domination much like those that plagued baseball throughout its long history. 
From 1936 to 1964, the New York Yankees won 16 championships, including five in a row in the early ‘50s, and appeared in 22 of those 29 World Series. In the late ‘90s, they rattled off four titles in five years. 
While it would be ridiculous to expect the Dodgers to replicate this level of excellency, it’s likely they will continue to be prohibitive favorites for at least the next several years. In any case, the problem extends past the construction of one talented team in particular. 
What needs to be addressed is the lack of a hard salary cap. MLB attempts to level the playing field with its “Competitive Balance Tax,” more commonly known as the luxury tax. However, this tax has failed to promote a competitive balance. 
The reason the Yankees have 27 banners, 16 more than the next team, the St. Louis Cardinals, is that they’ve always been able to shell out the big bucks. New York had been the biggest market; the Yankees had the richest owners and they were willing to spend. Now, the biggest media market is Los Angeles.
The luxury tax was implemented in 1997. Afterwards, the Yankees promptly won three consecutive titles, which might have been an early indication that the tax wasn’t doing its job. Since 2003, New York has exceeded the luxury tax threshold in every season but one. 
This isn’t an indictment of the Yankees or the Dodgers, and I don’t intend to discredit the accomplishment of great teams that accomplished great feats. The point is that the structure of the luxury tax doesn’t deter big-market teams from spending over the threshold.
Under the current collective bargaining agreement, teams pay a 20% tax on the money exceeding the threshold. So, if a team goes $10 million over the threshold, it pays $2 million in tax to MLB. This number jumps to 30% if a team exceeds the cap in two consecutive seasons and 50% for three or more seasons in a row.
If a team exceeds the threshold by $20 to $40 million, it incurs an additional 12% in tax. For going over the tax by more than $40 million, a team must pay an additional 42.5% for its first offense and 45% the second time. 
In theory, a team could pay a maximum of 95 percent on the part of its payroll that extends past $40 million over the luxury tax threshold. A team might pay 20% on it’s first $20 million over the luxury tax, 32% on the $20 to $40 million range and 62.5% on everything past $40 million. All of this is under the assumption that it is the team’s first season over the cap. 
These taxes pilling up to 95% is pretty rare, and it really isn’t significant compared to the amount a team would have to spend to reach this number. 
Let me provide an example. The luxury tax threshold is $210 million this year. As of now, the Dodgers’ payroll comes out to just over $254 million. 
I’ll spare you the calculations, but the Dodgers were not over the soft cap in 2020, so they will pay roughly just $13 million in luxury tax. Owners willing to spend $254 million won’t hesitate to pay the additional $13 million. 
The gap between the Dodgers and the lowest-spending team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, is pretty eye-opening. The Pirates’ luxury tax payroll for 2021 is just over $58 million. For context, the Angels will pay sluggers Mike Trout and Albert Pujols a combined $67 million this season. 
The Dodgers payroll before the tax is about $50 million larger than the next team, the Boston Red Sox, who are not even exceeding the luxury tax threshold. It’s almost $200 million higher than the Pirates’ spending. 
This results in the Dodgers having three former MVPs on their roster and two former Cy Young award winners in Clayton Kershaw and Trevor Bauer. Oh, and they just signed Bauer to a contract that will generously exceed the largest annual contract value in MLB history, just one season after dominating the National League and winning the World Series. 
The Dodgers seemed untouchable last season, and with the addition of Bauer, who just won the NL Cy Young award with the Cincinnati Reds, they should prove to be even better this season. L.A. also has Mookie Betts locked up on a 12-year deal, and they managed to keep stars Cody Bellinger and Walker Buehler for cheap in the short run.
When the time comes for Bellenger and Buehler to get their paydays, I’m sure the Dodgers’ ownership group won’t let them walk to save a few million in luxury tax. 
While this isn’t the first time a team has paid its way to the top of the league, the Dodgers are spending more than three other teams combined. It’s obvious that teams like Pittsburgh and the Baltimore Orioles simply cannot compete. 
While the Dodgers have done a great job of building a roster and developing young talent, not every team has the luxury of signing Mookie Betts to a $365 million contract. A hard salary cap wouldn’t make teams like Pittsburgh spend an extra hundred million on its payroll, but it would prevent teams like the Dodgers from looking like the old Yankees.

With March just around the corner, the No. 19 men’s basketball team now enters a key late-season stretch that could determine its tournament fate. 
Head coach Andy Enfield’s squad will head east to Boulder to take on the Colorado Buffaloes Thursday night. 
The Trojans last battled the Buffaloes back on New Year’s Eve at the Galen Center, coming up short in a 72-62 loss. USC was unable to assert their dominance on the glass despite their size advantage, and star freshman forward Evan Mobley managed only 12 points, shooting 5-14 from the field. Sophomore guard Ethan Anderson, then sidelined from a back injury, looked on from the bench as his team struggled to generate an efficient offense against Colorado. 
Anderson returned to the starting lineup in February, leading the offense in a 72-58 thumping of the Oregon Ducks. Anderson posted six points, seven rebounds, eight assists and allowed only one turnover. USC jumped out to a blistering start thanks to redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy’s hot shooting and Anderson’s steady playmaking, leading the game from wire-to-wire. 
“A big part of my game that I am going to emphasize over the rest of this year and upcoming years is just being able to do everything because I believe that’s where my value lies,” Anderson said. “[I’m] able to score, to rebound and to assist and to do everything on the court; I think that’s why I’m valuable.”
Anderson’s jack-of-all-trades play style will be on full display against Colorado as he will have his hands full on the defensive end. The biggest threat to shut down will be the Buffaloes’ offensive engine, senior guard McKinley Wright IV. Wright put up 19 points, four rebounds and four assists against the Trojans during the two teams’ last meeting. The senior will look to put on a show at his final home game, where the Buffaloes have been extremely strong all year with an 8-1 record.
“I am going to watch a lot of film this week, over the next two days, to really see what he likes to do, what he doesn’t like to do,” Anderson said. “I am going to continue to do what I do — focus, lock in on him and try to make things tough on him so we can get the win.”
As important as Wright is to the Colorado attack, it doesn’t just end with him. Senior guard D’Shawn Schwartz put consistent pressure on the rim, having recorded a double-double in the first matchup against USC. Senior forward Jeriah Horne has connected on 43.8% of his attempts from beyond the arc this season, so USC’s perimeter defenders will have to respect Colorado from behind the arc. 
A win against the Buffaloes would put the Trojans in premier position to snag their first regular-season Pac-12 title since 1985. USC currently holds the first seed with UCLA right on its tail, just half a game behind. A win against the Buffaloes might solidify the No.1 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament for the Trojans. 
The journey to the Big Dance ramps up now, as every game carries serious gravity for this Trojans team. The first step is to even the series against Colorado on Thursday. Tip-off is at 6 p.m.

K-pop group BTS set the night alight with their appearance on MTV Unplugged, turning a regular Tuesday night into one that will be ingrained inside everyone’s memories for a long while.
Members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook, performed five songs for the half-hour special, four of which were from their most recent album, “BE.” With each performance, BTS’ presence through the screen grew, starting with the blood pressure raising “Telepathy.” 
“Telepathy” is already bright on its own, but the band put on a show that glowed as much as the neon “BE” sign in the background of their set. Lounging around in an old-school basement while playing foosball and arcade games, it was clear how much the boys were genuinely enjoying themselves, which added to the excitement.
Following their upbeat act, the wide range of BTS’ emotions and musicality shined in a personal favorite: their slow ballad, “Blue & Grey.” The vocal line effortlessly switched between chest voice and falsetto with impressive control; the rap line rapped with sensitivity and flow. Jimin, in particular, stood out with his elegant harmonizing.
“Blue & Grey” sent chills down the body from both the first note to the last, sung by V, who co-wrote the song. After a difficult year of being unable to tour because of the pandemic, V “translated the feeling of burning out as ‘blue’ and the sadness of not being able to see ARMY as ‘grey.’” V went on to explain how due to the simple acoustic-guitar driven melody, he “paid closer attention to delivering emotions through the lyrics.” 
Well, he succeeded; “Blue & Grey” will tear at your heart.
Suga, who had recently recovered from shoulder surgery in November, returned to perform with the boys again and similarly spoke about the creative process behind “Telepathy.” He explained: “We’re in a situation where we can’t meet our fans around the world in person due to COVID-19, so the song’s lyrics describe our current situation of temporarily being apart from each other.”
Having released “BE” Nov. 20, BTS have been unable to promote the album on tour. After “Telepathy” and “Blue & Grey,” the boys thanked MTV Unplugged for allowing them to perform both tracks live for the first time, but still expressed their disappointment over being unable to connect with their fanbase, the ARMY, in person. BTS hoped to bring the ARMY comfort with their surprise cover of Coldplay’s “Fix You,” a song that Jimin explained gave the band comfort throughout 2020. 
The group’s rendition of “Fix You” was angelic, ethereal and worthy of becoming the new national anthem. It took what “Blue & Grey” gave and further honed in on the depths of each members’ vocal abilities, including the three members of the rap line who are seldom given chances to display their singing. 
From Jin’s powerful belting and Jungkook’s delicate falsettos to RM’s rich baritone and J-Hope’s soulful tone, each member gave a different texture to the song. When all their voices fused together, it was hauntingly beautiful and breathtaking. BTS’ cover of “Fix You” is, undoubtedly, what you would hear going up the stairs to heaven, and for many, BTS is the beacon of light that will guide them to it.
In true MTV Unplugged style, a live band masked up to join BTS for their last two performances. The group sang “Life Goes On,” their third song to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and the first ever song sung in Korean to claim that title. After this performance, it’s obvious why. 
Written during the pandemic, “Life Goes On” is a message from BTS about how, although the world has changed, their love for the ARMY has not. BTS stares longingly at the camera to deliver the message of hope that life goes on and there will be a future in which they can all be reunited in person again. 
The night ended with another energetic performance of Grammy nominated “Dynamite.” BTS has virtually performed their hit single throughout 2020, but each performance adds a new spark of energy. The band’s all-white outfits in “Dynamite” fit the heavenliness of the entire night.
Before the pandemic canceled live music, BTS was set to embark on a world tour for their one-year-old album, “Map of the Soul: 7.” While it is disappointing that BTS has now been unable to perform two albums in flesh, MTV Unplugged is an intimate reminder of their continuous dedication to outdoing themselves each day. 
Even when stripped of the complicated choreography and jaw-dropping special effects, BTS still delivers the performance of a lifetime. They can sit on a stool and sway, yet their stage presence is unlike others, even through the confines of a screen. BTS’ MTV Unplugged concert highlighted why the group remains a powerhouse and why they are deserving of their global stardom: because of their talent, rawness, humility and unwavering love and passion for what they do and who they do it for. 
In taking the MTV Unplugged stage, BTS showed fans that the long wait for a return to normalcy will soon be worth it, with BTS there waiting.

Producing music and heartening melodies since the age of 14, USC rising artist Ellie Williams is currently racking up over 140,000 monthly Spotify listeners and aspiring to write songs for top pop musicians such as Alessia Cara.
Majoring in pop music performance with an emphasis in songwriting and a minor in the music industry, Williams has written countless songs, produced her own album “Act my Age” and hopes to one day pursue songwriting as a career.
Growing up, Williams’ life was heavily influenced by her musical family. 
“As a kid, my dad would play guitar for me and my older sisters, and I would write songs with my sisters and play guitar hero and pretend to have concerts on the coffee table and write songs about monsters and mermaids,” Williams said.
Some of the earliest songs Williams remembers writing are “Shoelace” and “Baby Got a Run,” both of which she wrote as a kid with her sister. However, William’s first song that she felt had meaning and depth was “Sweet Dreams,” which can be found on her Spotify.
Her family’s musical influence helped her find her love for music at such a young age. Many of these experiences helped develop her musical sound today. From Nat King Cole to Norah Jones, a lot of the music Williams listened to while growing up was introduced to her by her father. 
“I think there’s just so much music intake all the time that subconsciously just plays a role in every song that I write,” Williams said.
As her passion grew, Williams began to take guitar, piano and voice lessons, even joining choir in middle school where she sang soprano. At theage of 13, she began performing with her piano teacher at jazz clubs, singing jazz standards. 
Not much later Williams began doing solo performances where she transitioned into singing pop and alternative music.
Williams’ passion for music quickly turned from a side hobby to a serious passion. In middle school she began taking music lessons from musician Ashley Davis, who also produces music for streaming platforms.
Williams recalls the two of them working together on one of Davis’ songs. After working through the plot and the characters of the songs and arranging the lyrics, Williams left that day knowing what she wanted to do with her life was make music.
“I left that day being like, ‘OK, this is what I want to do. Like, I loved that.’ So that was kind of how I really really got into it,” Williams said.
In high school, Williams moved from Kansas to California with her mom to pursue her music career. Her freshman year of high school, she did online school in order to release her first album, “Act my Age.” The process of recording an album at such a young age taught Williams about the studio setting.
“Going from no knowledge of a studio setting to recording a whole album was a big leap,” Williams said. 
Williams moved to California having never produced music, but by the time she had finished her first album that year she was familiar with all the details of the studio setting. Her imagination at the time was very strong and she was able to write a lot of songs bu wasn’t yet well-versed in all that went into the production aspect. Her producer taught her how to record, do background vocals, doubles and harmonize. 
This first album, “Act my Age,” was inspired by a multitude of events she was living through at the time.
“The ones that I did bring in myself were all inspired from situations that I was going through, like my friends’ breakup and a crush that I had and one relationship. I think it was a mix between that and also writing about what I thought about the idea of love at that moment in time,” Williams said.
Williams’ more recent music has also been inspired by events and relationships in her own life. “Clueless,” which Williams claims to be her most rewarding and vulnerable single, was inspired by confusion in her personal relationships. 
“One particular day that we’d hung out they were just extra confusing that day and I came home and was just kind of frustrated because I couldn’t figure them out,” Williams said. “I just sat down and kind of vented in the form of lyrics and that’s kind of how clueless came about.” 
According to Williams, her recent music, including “Clueless,” “Perfect Playlist,” “Aren’t We” and “Live Cinema,” were all written around a similar time when she was developing a consistent sound that represents who she is and the music she wants to create.
“I think those four songs kind of represent a certain time in my life,” Williams said. “They kind of are like a little bit of a time capsule for me and I definitely think they share a lot of similarities.”             
Williams continues writing songs all the time to practice her songwriting skills. She is also practicing music production to share more content with her listeners. 
“I’m always writing music for myself,” Williams said. “I think most songwriters will write probably 1,000 songs that the public never hears, because it’s just them practicing their craft and working on it.”
Remi Frolichman, Williams’ freshman year roommate and long time friend, mentioned how she constantly felt inspired by the consistent effort Williams put into her music.
“Seeing her working independently was really inspiring to me because I got to see how much of her time she takes to be creative, and that, it definitely encouraged me to do the same with my time,” Frolichman said.
Caleb Tischbern, a sophomore majoring in popular music, has been friends with Williams since high school. They have worked together on Williams’ music and he has been featured playing the drums on several of her songs, such as “Clueless.” 
“Now obviously, a couple years later she’s still doing the same thing, but now she’s getting way more recognition for work and the numbers are showing and she’s releasing more music which is great because we always told her like she needs to release music,” Tischbern said. “It’s been great to just see her growth as a musician and an artist.” 
Ultimately, Williams considers herself a songwriter and is in the process of creating more music for her listeners. However, she has yet to announce any release dates.
Once the pandemic has passed, Williams hopes to continue doing tours and live performances. These were a huge part of her career before the pandemic and are something that Williams hopes to be doing again soon.
“I think, at the core, I would consider myself a songwriter. I really love writing songs and writing music. So if I’m not doing that for myself, I want to be doing it for other people,” Williams said.

Growing up, representation was a big thing for me. Seeing someone on screen that looked like me made visualizing goals and achievements possible. So, when I heard that Netflix was building up its representation for Black and Indigenous people and people of color, I was excited until I started recognizing a trend. The representation for many Black women on screen fits the mold with a preference for light-skinned actresses. 
As of recently, I’ve seen changes made to the Netflix home screen with collections like “Representation Matters” and “Black Lives Matter,” but in most cases, lighter complexioned women are at the forefront and given thought out and positive character development. 
Why not start with a look at the steamy period-romance that is, “Bridgerton?” From the first look at the cast, it looks like the majority of the protagonists are white men and women, which isn’t surprising for a Regency-era English drama. Upon closer look, though, there are actually two Black women: one who is lighter-skinned, Marina Thompson, and the other who is darker, Lady Danbury. 
Lady Danbury acts as a sort of maternal figure to the leading man, Simon, and is both widowed and without a family. On the other hand, Marina Thompson is a debutante looking to find a husband as an eligible bachelorette. 
While the show does consider itself a romance, it is a bit disappointing that the only dark-skinned woman depicted in high society doesn’t receive it at all. This is very reminiscent of an interview Viola Davis, a darker-skinned actress, had with Entertainment Weekly where she mentions how none of her characters have been in the position for romance.
“I was not able to be sexualized. Ever. In my entire career,” Davis said. “And here’s the thing that’s even more potent: I’ve never seen anyone who even looks like me be sexualized on television or in film. Ever.”
Similarly, “All American,” also had its moments. Though not a Netflix original, it was added to the streaming service and gained popularity among many young adults. The show follows Spencer, a high school football player from South Central, who gets the chance to play at Beverly Hills High School, so a majority Black cast isn’t unexpected.
Much like “Bridgerton,” though, many of the Black female main characters are lighter-skinned women like Olivia Baker and Layla Keating. In the show, Baker is Spencer’s best friend and Keating is Beverly Hills High School’s “It Girl.” With both characters as love interests and experiencing the highs and lows of high school, it’s much different for the darker women portrayed … and there are only two.
One of the first darker Black women depicted is Spencer’s mother, Grace, who raised him as a single mom and at times struggles with raising two boys. This trope of the Black single mother has been around for years, from actress Diahann Carroll in the 1974 movie “Claudine” to Tyler Perry’s 2014 movie “Single Moms Club.” 
Luckily, there is another darker-skinned Black woman in the show named Tamia “Coop” Cooper who gets to experience love but then struggles with her sexuality. Later in the show, she also seems to get into gang-related activities, which is a bit disheartening because of the correlation between Black characters and negative television portrayals. 
In a study called “#Representation Matters,” done by the National Research Group, over 83% of Black Americans think “Hollywood perpetuates negative stereotypes of Black people,” and, in many cases, it seems that the correlation is with darker people, especially when people associate darker skin with immoral acts.
To further illustrate this idea, the show “Dear White People” is very similar in nature. The show centers around Samantha White, a lighter complexioned woman at a predominantly white college. She has a darker-skinned best friend named Joelle Brooks, who sadly is not as well developed of a character as White. In most cases, Joelle is Sam’s right-hand woman with, seemingly, no life of her own. 
While White is running a podcast and championing for Black students on campus, Brooks is usually seen stress eating or working out as hobbies. Much like the other shows mentioned, White constantly has men vying for her attention, like students Reggie and Gabe, but Joelle is left pining, thus leaving the dark-skinned sidekick underdeveloped and overly reliant on others.
There’s a common theme amongst all of these shows, whether it be darker Black women aren’t deserving of love or they fit the mold of common negative Black stereotypes. When Netflix preaches its inclusion, especially with its social media account “Strong Black Lead,” it still feels that its programming falls into old tropes. As a darker Black woman, seeing these portrayals is a bit discouraging, especially when I see what can be done. So to Netflix, casting directors and the media industry: Don’t be afraid of the dark.

How is February already almost over? Time has seemingly flown by but also has moved at an excruciatingly slow pace. Over the past two months, this country entered a transitional period with a new president and also dramatically increased its distribution of coronavirus vaccines.
Though we shouldn’t remain ignorant of the world’s events, it’s okay to plug in your headphones and tune everything out once in a while. What better way to do that than to discover the new music that blessed us during February?
“Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” by Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift’s long-awaited “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” is finally here, and it could not have come at a better time. After the 31-year-old artist announced in 2019 that she would be re-recording and releasing her first six studio albums to regain control of her discography from her former record label, this Feb. 12 release is the first sneak peek into her endeavor. “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” is reminiscent of 2008, back when Swift first fooled the world into believing that all love was like the love she sings about in her songs. Thirteen years later, her matured vocals continue to bring out everyone’s inner hopeless romantics.
“PINK PLANET” by Pink Sweat$
Pink Sweat$’ first studio album, “PINK PLANET,” was also released Feb. 12. The Philly-born artist debuted in 2018 with platinum-certified “Honesty.” His first two EPs earned him accolades from Billboard, Apple Music and YouTube, as well as a nomination for Best New Artist at the 2019 Soul Train Awards. Expectations were high, but “PINK PLANET” delivered. “PINK PLANET” is pleasant all throughout its extensive tracklist of 18 songs and encapsulates everything Pink Sweat$ does best: making the world swoon over his brilliant, romantic lyricism and buttery vocals.
“Carried Away” by Surf Mesa and Madison Beer 
To finish off the Feb. 12 releases, Surf Mesa and Madison Beer’s first collaboration is this month’s ultimate feel-good love ballad. “Carried Away” reflects all love and no pain, and the song is deserving of just that from fans. The duo captures the feeling of meeting someone and falling in love for the first time. The innocence and youthfulness of the song’s meaning blends perfectly with the light strumming of the guitar and Beer’s soulful tone, bound to carry listeners away to a fairy tale scene and leave butterflies in their stomachs. Expectations are now high for Beer’s debut studio album “Life Support,” which will be released Feb. 26.
“Up” by Cardi B
Cardi B may have another one of her songs trending on TikTok with her latest release. Coming out of the “WAP” high and having charted on Billboard’s Top 100 for four consecutive weeks, Cardi returns to ‘up’ her career with “Up,” released Feb. 5. “Up” is speculated to appear on her sophomore album and is another high-energy track to listen to while working out or mindlessly completing a task. Cardi’s explosive mood booster will leave listeners feeling ‘up’ for the rest of the day.
“40:42” by Vampire Weekend
Early in 2019, Vampire Weekend released their song “2021.” For the band’s “40:42” EP released Feb. 4 of this year, the band recruited jazz saxophonist Sam Gendel and rock band Goose to cover and produce their own versions of “2021,” each lasting exactly 20:21. If it wasn’t already obvious, the EP’s name cleverly results from adding both durations. Gendel’s version remains authentic to his jazz sound, while Goose relies on improvisation of instrumentation and vocal sound effects. Both covers are an abstract listen, but in all its oddity, “40:42” as a whole is enthralling. It also makes for good study music, so for those sick of the same lofi hip-hop beats, give this EP a listen.
“Remote (Deluxe)” by Wallows
Wallows first revealed “Remote” on Oct. 23, but five additional songs were released as part of “Remote (Deluxe)” on Feb. 19. Its cover flaunts a brightly-colored TV static design and the songs’ use of synths and distortion of sounds all create a vintage effect. There’s no question about it, this album belongs in a bowling alley scene in an ’80s coming-of-age movie. “Remote (Deluxe)” flexes smooth transitioning between each song and the cohesiveness of the entire discography. With the vibey blend of retro, pop and indie, “Remote (Deluxe)” is a testament to Wallows’ constant pushing and exploration of their style.
“Way Less Sad” by AJR
“Way Less Sad,” released Feb. 17, is the fourth single off of AJR’s upcoming album “OK ORCHESTRA.” At first, the lyrics seem to lack complexity but a closer analysis reveals the trio’s unique but genius outlook on life and happiness. Singing “I should move ‘cause New York is gettin’ muddy out / there’s L.A. but it’s always kinda sunny out,” AJR introduces how people will always find a way to be unhappy with an alternative option because it’s not perfect. But by setting “my bar real low / I ain’t happy yet, but I’m way less sad.” AJR suggests that happiness comes more naturally when there is not an expectation of perfection and that while happiness is difficult to achieve, feeling less sad is progress nonetheless. Fitting the song’s title and meaning, “Way Less Sad” and its upbeat tone will make listeners way less sad throughout 2021.
