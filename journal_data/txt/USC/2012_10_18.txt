The USC men’s and women’s swimming teams are both set to compete this weekend as the Women of Troy will split their squad to compete in the SMU Swim Classic on Friday, Oct. 19 and Saturday, Oct. 20 as well as at home against San Diego on Friday, Oct. 19. The Trojans will open their season at home against North Carolina State, also on Friday and Saturday.
The women’s team looks to build on its back-to-back third-place finishes at the NCAA Championships and a 165-88 victory in their opening meet against Utah. The team is led by a strong core of veterans, including senior co-captain Haley Anderson, an NCAA champion, three-time All-American, three-time Pac-12 champion and silver medalist at the 2012 Olympics. The Women of Troy other returning All-Americans are senior co-captain Christel Simms; seniors Lindsay Parrish, Yumi So and Jessica Schimtt; and juniors Stina Gardell, Meghan Hawthorne and Lynette Lim.
USC is one of six teams competing at the SMU Swim Classic; competitors include host SMU, Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Louisville. Each team can only use eight swimmers and one diver in the competition, with only one swimmer per team in the “A” and “B” finals of each event. The meet begins at 4:30 p.m. PT both days.
The rest of the women’s team will host San Diego in a non-conference meet, which starts at 2 p.m. The men’s team looks to bounce back from back-to-back seventh-place finishes at the NCAA championships as they take on North Carolina State.
The men’s team meet will start at 2 p.m. on Friday and 11 a.m. on Saturday.
The team returns five All-Americans, including senior Alex Lendrum; juniors Vladimir Morozov, Dimitri Colupaev and Jack Wagner; and sophomore Cristian Quintero.

After a long streak of road games that included seven overtime periods, three losses and two ties, the USC women’s soccer teamn is more than happy to end the regular season with a five-game home stand.
Bad streak · Jordan Marada, picured here during a Sept. 21 game against Washington, has started 14 games in 2012. The junior midfielder and USC have struggled in recent weeks, not winning a game since defeating the Huskies. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
“With all the traveling and playing overtimes back to back, it was just physically exhausting,” freshman forward Jamie Fink said. “Now that we’re home, we kind of get to relax and take it easy on our legs.”
USC (4-7-3, 1-3-2) is tied for ninth in the Pac-12 — though, has yet to face No. 2 Stanford or No. 3 UCLA with five conference games remaining.
That doesn’t bode well for the team, which has been outscored 12-6 during its current five-game winless streak.
But the players are hoping that they can still turn their season around with the aid of a home-field advantage — after all, they won their only home conference game, a 1-0 victory over Washington, to open Pac-12 play.
“It’s kind of refreshing,” redshirt sophmore defender Mia Bruno said. “Even though we haven’t won many games, we’re excited; I think we will start winning.”
Fink says is taking a relaxed approach from here on out.
“We’re not really focused on winning or losing, or going to the [NCAA] tournament,” Fink said. “We’re more focused on playing soccer and having fun and being a team.”
But if USC does have any shot at making the NCAA tournament, it’ll have to make strides this weekend in its matches against Utah and Colorado.
The Utes (8-4-2, 3-3-0) stand at fifth in the conference standings, and are receiving votes in the NCAA coaches’ poll. The Utes boast a stellar defense, having allowed only 12 goals in 14 games, and are 5-0-1 when scoring two or more goals.
USC’s offense has shown it can hold possession against strong defenses, as the team leads the conference in shots per game (18.64), but it also ranks just fifth in goals per game (1.64).
“It’s positive that we are leading the conference in shots, which means we’re creating opportunities, but we’ve just been lacking a little composure,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We’ve been lacking a better understanding of finding another player with a higher percentage opportunity.”
But Khosroshahin insists his team is close to breaking that habit.
“I’ve been saying this all year, and I probably sound a little hypocritical, or like I’m lying, but we’re really close,” Khosroshahin said. “We’ve been close for a while, there’s just been a bit of a disconnect … between knowing the game plan and really understanding the game plan. And I think we’ve been able to sort it out this week [in practice].”
After facing off against Utah on Friday, the Women of Troy will host the Buffaloes (6-6-3, 0-5-1), who sit in last place in the Pac-12 on Sunday.
USC is 3-0-0 all-time against Colorado after a 1-0 victory on the road last year, but the Buffaloes do have a lethal scorer in forward Anne Stuller, who ranks third in the Pac-12 with eight goals this season.
Stuller could cause some issues for the Women of Troy, who have struggled defensively all season. USC ranks last in the Pac-12 in goals-against average (1.94) and has shut out only one opponent all season.
But Bruno, who was injured for the first half of the season along with senior defender Kristina Noriega, thinks the squad is up to the challenge.
“We’ve kind of had rotating personnel [on defense], but I think we’ve found our four [starters],” Bruno said. “We have some new players back there, we’re still getting used to each other, getting that camaraderie, but it gets better with every game.”
The Women of Troy kick off against Utah at McAlister Field on Friday at 3:30 p.m., then face off against Sunday Colorado at 1 p.m.

The No. 7 USC women’s volleyball team opens up the weekend celebrating Alumni Night on Friday with Utah (11-11, 2-7) on tap for a 6 p.m. match. Sunday presents another matchup against a Pac-12 foe, as conference newcomer Colorado (13-7, 3-5) heads to town trying to seek revenge on a USC squad that has dominated them in the past.
Though the Women of Troy (17-3, 5-3) had a difficult week when they headed up north to face rivals Stanford and Cal, playing at home might get the team back in a steady rhythm.
“This was probably the hardest trip that we’ve been on, especially with midterms going on. They were tired and for them to win 3-0 against Cal is very, very good,” coach Mick Haley said.
Despite winning at Cal in three sets, USC still ended their road trip feeling as if it didn’t get a fair shake against a freshmen-led Stanford team.
“We know we needed to step it up after the Stanford game,” senior outside hitter Katie Fuller said. “We were really focused this weekend and we got the momentum back.”
The lack of a consistent presence in the middle was never more obvious than during the match against the Cardinal. Though USC didn’t get great contributions from outside hitting, Stanford continually dominated at the net.
While some of that has to do with Stanford middle blocker Carly Wopat patrolling the net, the Women of Troy know they must become more consistent in their attacking in general.
“We need to work on our offense,” Haley said. “We’re going to introduce a few new things into our offensive system, but we’ve had to shorten our practices because of tests … This week allowed us to get our breath back and we just need to simplify our game.”
When junior middle hitter Alexis Olgard did get involved, USC showed signs of life against Stanford. That example just goes to show that when USC has its middle hitters involved, it relieves the pressure off the outside hitters.
Against Utah, the Women of Troy will have an added edge with the home advantage of Alumni Night. The Utes have come on strong as of late, dominating a talented Arizona State team last week. With Utah led by sophomore Bailey Bateman, who ranks top in the conference with 121 blocks, USC will have its hands full once again trying to get kills with a strong defense on the other side of the net.
“We’ve been working on our defense and execution in practice,” said Fuller. “We just need to be relaxed and focus on our ball skills.”
The Women of Troy will look to continue their success with a easier-than-usual slate against Washington and Washington State beginning on Oct. 26-27. With USC entering a very winnable stretch, the Women of Troy will likely display their true form as a team in the coming weeks.

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team looks to keep its undefeated season rolling along Friday night as the squad travels south to take on No. 10 Long Beach State.
Contributor · Sophomore driver Zach Lucas has scored 10 goals in 2012. He has helped lead the No. 1 Trojans to a 16-0 start this season. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (16-0) are playing in their seventh consecutive road game as they hope to play spoiler in the 49ers’ (17-3) conference opener.
After an early season filled with tournaments and travel, the Trojans are settling into a conference schedule that usually requires them to play just one MPSF opponent per week.
“[The conference schedule] lets us focus on one opponent at a time, allowing us to find exact, specific strategies to be best prepared with,” senior driver Michael Rosenthal said.
Having just one game a week means more morning practices as well as a bigger focus on conditioning during those practices.
A main reason for the Trojans’ four consecutive national championships is USC players are in great shape. Against the 49ers, conditioning should once again prove valuable.
“[Long Beach State] can be very dangerous in the counterattack as well as shooting the ball from outside,” coach Jovan Vavic said. “We have to take every game seriously and not relax.”
The 49ers’ leading scorer is Dan Matulis, who is one of the tallest players on the college water polo scene at 6-foot-11. His height will provide the Trojans a unique challenge.
“You have to work more to get around him because he covers more space,” senior driver Tobias Preuss said. “Because he’s so big, you have to really be strong on your legs and pound him so he can’t go under you.”
Rosenthal, however, mentioned how the Trojans can use Matulis’s height to create a mismatch of their own.
“A lot of times, big guys like that aren’t the fastest in the pool,” he said. “We’ll take advantage of his slowness to really make him a liability to their team in the transition, and hopefully make him tired so he can’t play very many minutes.”
Vavic also mentioned to look out for Milos Vrzic, the 49ers’ sophomore from Serbia. Having grown up playing a similar style of water polo, Vrzic will be more adept at predicting the Trojans’ offensive tendencies and movement.
For the stretch run, another factor going the Trojans’ way is the team’s health.
“This is the healthiest we’ve been all year,” Rosenthal said. “Knock on wood, but besides ‘Bos’ [senior Brian Boswell is missing the 2012 season with medical issues], the entire team is ready to go.”
Vavic and the team will be focusing on starting strong Friday after last week’s unimpressive first period.
Against No. 9 Loyola Marymount on Oct. 13, the Trojans trailed 1-0 after the first period. This marked the first time all season the squad failed to score during a quarter, and coach Vavic was not happy despite the 13-6 win.
Vavic also adjusted the lineup during the second period, utilizing some lesser-used players who he believes could see more time in the pool than usual this Friday.
“A lot of these guys are redshirt freshmen, and are stepping up to become big contributors down the line,” Vavic said.
The quintet of Mac Carden, Marc Vonderweidt, Chase Watson, Russell Renteria and Max Hurst-Mendoza were all mentioned by Vavic and other teammates as important to the victory over LMU.
“Those guys came in the second quarter, scored three goals in a row, and really broke it [the game] open,” Rosenthal said.
Last week’s game showed the value of the Trojans’ depth, but Vavic was not pleased with the first period showing and wants to see a significant improvement this week.
“We were not focused,” he said. “I told the team that we need to play with more intensity, because now every team is ready to face us.”

Remember how Arizona State unraveled a year ago? A promising beginning to the 2011 season, punctuated by a 43-22 victory over USC in the fourth week, quickly spiraled into mediocrity as the Sun Devils lost their final five games.
You didn’t need to be a college football pundit to determine the source of their woes: a lack of discipline.
Cheap shot · In 2011, senior safety T.J. McDonald was suspended for the first half of the game against Colorado for “head-hunting” receivers. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
More specifically, the Sun Devils finished 120th in the Football Bowl Subdivision in penalty yards per game; I might add that the FBS only fielded 120 teams in 2011.
This unfortunate distinction effectively doomed former coach Dennis Erickson’s career in Tempe, completing a five-year stretch in which his teams, outside of a middling 76th finish in his first year, never finished better than 108th in the nation in penalty yards per game. By the end of Erickson’s tenure, the patients were undeniably running the asylum.
In advance of last season’s matchup at Arizona State, USC then-junior quarterback Matt Barkley famously called out middle linebacker Vontaze Burfict, who earned a whopping 17 personal fouls in his career, as a dirty player who seeks to injure opponents intentionally. Barkley later earned Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott’s reprimand for stating the obvious, levying a character attack on a fellow Pac-12 player.
Now that Arizona State is only averaging 4.5 penalties per game and Burfict has played his way out of the 2012 NFL draft’s first round and into undrafted free agent status, who is the NCAA’s most penalized football team, you might ask? Who is no. 120, if you will?
The statistics don’t lie: It’s No. 10 USC. The Trojans average 10 penalties per game — more than double the number the incumbent bad boy Sun Devils post. In fact, USC’s 78.3 penalty yards per game is essentially on par with 2011 Arizona State’s 79.8 figure, which was universally panned as outrageous at the time.
Now, USC isn’t a dirty team — just undisciplined. Perhaps the only Trojan with a reputation as a head-hunter is senior safety T.J. McDonald, who was suspended for the first half of USC’s 42-17 victory over Colorado last season for repeated targeting of defenseless receivers.
Reviewing the distribution of USC’s penalties this season, sloppiness on offense is the greatest offender. Of the team’s 60 penalties, 29 have come on either a delay of game, false start or holding penalty.
Responsibility for these types of penalties falls primarily on the quarterback and offensive line, which is surprising because USC returns five of six starters from the 2011 group, the only change being offensive tackle Aundrey Walker instead of 2012 NFL first-round draft pick Matt Kalil. Walker also just so happens to be the most heavily penalized player on the team — a development that has forced USC coach Lane Kiffin to open up his spot for competition with freshman Max Tuerk.
One would expect a return to the Coliseum would help solve many of these issues, as crowd noise on the road drowns out Barkley’s cadences and can contribute to false starts and delay of games, but USC has essentially taken penalties at an equal clip at the Coliseum and away — eight per game at home compared to 11 on the road.
Though personal foul penalties — those most commonly associated with dirty teams — are still problematic, they have ultimately not been as much of an issue for USC.
But toss in four more substitution infraction penalties, and it’s clear that  a veteran USC offensive unit is, for some inexplicable combination of reasons, struggling to just line up correctly and snap the ball.
To be honest, I’m baffled. There’s no way to rationalize this number of penalties. What can be said, however, is that USC’s final box scores would look a lot more commensurate with the games we watched if the Trojans buckled down and didn’t take so many penalties.
What can also be said is that USC’s current pace is bad news if it genuinely considers itself a top-tier team with BCS bowl aspirations. There’s absolutely no chance of beating No. 3 Oregon if the Trojans take 14 penalties like they did against Utah.
The 2011 Arizona State team collapsed under the weight of its inattention to detail and selfish penalties after the play. With the meat of its schedule finally here, USC needs to reverse course quickly unless it also wishes to experience a similar downward trajectory.

For the third time this season, No. 10 USC (5-1) will play a game in the friendly confines of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Trojans have been on the road for four of their first six contests, but will return home to play Colorado on Saturday.
Paving the way · The offensive line has opened up running lanes for junior running back Silas Redd in recent weeks. Redd rushed for a season-high 155 yards against Washington on the road last Saturday. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
After a pair of tough games at Utah and Washington, USC coach Lane Kiffin is happy to finally be home, knowing his team has a lot to work on.
“[The players] understand that this is all about us improving,” Kiffin said. “We have a lot of work to do. A lot of areas, whether it’s third down or penalties, a lot of things to work on.”
Kiffin alluded to the fact that the Trojan offense is converting just more than 30 percent of its third downs, a mark that Kiffin did not expect the team to be at with his cast of star players.
“I would never have guessed we’d be where we are on third downs right now,” Kiffin said.
This week’s contest against Colorado (1-5, 1-2) could be what USC needs to clean things up for the home stretch of the season. Colorado is yielding 41.3 points per game to opponents, good for 120th in the entire country. The Buffs have lost five of six games, including one contest to Sacramento State, a Football Championship Subdivision school. Rather than worry about the Buffs, the team is focused on playing better football overall.
“This week is all about us,” Kiffin said.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has not been throwing for the number of yards and touchdowns that many analysts expected and has already thrown six interceptions after throwing only seven last season. Junior wide receiver Robert Woods’ numbers are down significantly from last season and sophomore receiver Marqise Lee was held to just two catches last week. As a whole, the offense has not been dynamic, due in large part to penalties and other self-inflicted issues.
“We just haven’t made the plays when they’ve been there,” Kiffin said. “We’ve been on the road, missed some calls, missed some protections.”
While the stats for the passing game have fallen short of expectations, the Trojans’ running game has stepped up in recent weeks. Particularly, junior running back Silas Redd had 155 yards on the ground against the Huskies and looks to be the team’s featured back after a slow start to the season.
“I’m much more comfortable with my teammates and the coaches and the system and everything,” Redd said. “I feel a lot better.”
Practice was particularly intense over the last week. Despite the fact Colorado ranks among the worst teams in college football, Redd and his teammates say they are taking the game seriously.
“We’re coming out here and we’re acting like Colorado is Alabama,” Redd said. “We’re practicing hard … We’re not letting our foot off the gas.”
Though the offense has struggled recently, the defense has more than held up its end of the bargain. Particularly the defensive line, led by freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams and junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, have surprised many after initially being thought of as the team’s weak link.
“I feel like we just took that as a challenge,” Williams said. “[Defensive line coach Ed Orgeron] talked about that all the time. The [defensive] line was just like, ‘We’re not about to be the weak point of this team,’ and we just came together and made a point that we weren’t going to be that.”
USC’s defense is giving up just 18.5 points per game, and held an explosive Washington team to just 14 points. Considering Colorado averages just 20.8 points per game, the defense appears poised to perform well. That doesn’t mean the defensive players aren’t looking to improve, however.
“To be honest with you, we’re not really worrying about Colorado,” junior cornerback Nickell Robey said.  “We’re worrying about ourselves. We’re getting down to the crunch time of the season where we have to worry about ourselves.”
Considering that the Trojans play No. 3 Oregon in two weeks, Robey and the defense care more about getting better on the whole than about specific games.
“Whatever we got in store for that week, make sure we execute it,” Robey said of the defense’s game plan. “That’s just as far as rushing the quarterback, getting more hands on the ball when the ball is in the air, tackling. Just the fundamentals of the game. and as long as we get those things sharpened and keep working on them and coaches keep harping on those little things, it just makes the defense even greater.”
Saturday’s game against the Buffalos kicks off at 3 p.m. It will be shown nationally on the Pac-12 networks.

Sophomores from the popular music program in the Thornton School of Music perform Thursday night in Ground Zero Performance Café for their midterm. The program, which was founded in 2009 as an alternative to typical classical music and jazz programs, aims to help student instrumentalists, vocalists and songwriters pursue performance careers in whichever style of music they prefer.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Wednesday, Oct. 17, and Thursday, Oct. 18. 
 
Crimes against property
at 5:17 p.m. on Oct. 17, retail unit officers monitoring surveillance cameras at Pertusati University Bookstore observed a juvenile pick up several pens and a sweatshirt and conceal them under his clothing. The officers detained the juvenile when he exited the store without paying for the merchandise, and he was taken into custody by DPS officers who responded to the scene. The juvenile was then arrested, cited and released to a guardian.
at 8:25. a.m. on Oct. 17, DPS officers conducting a building check at the Physical Education Building observed that a door to a basement storage closet had been forced open. Several boxes inside the closet had been opened and what appeared to be paycheck stubs were strewn about the interior. It could not be determined if any property had been removed at the time of the report. Facility Management Services personnel were requested to repair the door.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 6:35 a.m. on Oct. 18, a staff member reported that someone defecated on a bench outside Ronald Tutor Campus Center. No suspect was seen and the bench was subsequently cleaned by janitorial staff.
at 3:14 a.m. on Oct. 18, two students reported that they observed two suspects running down Menlo Avenue carrying an unknown large object. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspects.
at 3:36 p.m. on Oct. 17, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC male who was vomiting at Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The male requested transportation for medical treatment, so an Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance was requested. RA Unit #814 responded and transported the male to California Hospital.
at 2:01 p.m. on Oct. 17, DPS officers responded to a report of a student entering the fountain at 34th Street and Trousdale Parkway. When the officers contacted her, they found her to be distraught. The student stated that she was having personal problems, and the officers asked if she would like to speak with a counselor at the Student Counseling Center. The student agreed and the officers transported her to the center without incident.
at 11:31 a.m. on Oct. 17, DPS officers responded to Stonier Hall at the request of a counselor who reported that a student was in need of an escort to the airport. The officers transported the student to the airport and left him in the company of a relative.
at 8:43 a.m. on Oct. 17, DPS officers responded to a student complaining of a rapid heartbeat and stomach pain at University Gateway Apartments. The student was feeling better when the officers arrived and stated that she believed her symptoms were stress related. The student was released to seek medical treatment on her own if the symptoms returned.
So wait, you’re telling me if I hit up DPS for a ride to the airport it actually works?
Also, Tex, you just won the internet.
I’m going to connect the stories together and they start to make sense.   Girl breaks up with guy and he then gets drunk and drops a stinky on bench outside Tutor.  His bro finds him takes him back to the frat house where they steal another bro’s flat screen and take it back to his Gateway apartment.  Girl finds stinky on bench outside Tutor as sees that he spelled out her name and the word “love”.   She instantly wants him back but he won’t respond to texts.  Girl cries and DPS finds her and they both carefully transfer the stinky “love” message to piece of cardboard and she takes it home to show her sorority sisters.   The guy still thinks he has been dumped so he decides to leave town.  DPS drives him to airport (because that’s what they do) and he flys back to BF east coast hometown.  She goes to his Gateway apartment and finds his new flat screen and gets mad that he spent money on something other than her.  She calls DPS complaining her stomach hurts from the bad $1 Chinese food.  The End…
Like a boss.
Sweet story!
This Roundup is filled with stories DPS has no business dealing with

The Undergraduate Student Government and USA Today  will offer free newspapers for eight weeks to students on campus beginning Monday. This partnership continues USG’s goal to increase readership of national newspapers among the student body.
Driven by the success of USG’s partnership with The New York Times, student government leaders reached out to other daily publications in order to offer students a variety of news sources.
Newsstands will be located at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism and Trojan Grounds. The delivery of The New York Times and USA Today will occur only Monday – Friday.
Compared to the semester-long New York Times program, the trial period for USA Today will last eight weeks. The trial period will be used to gauge students’ interests in the additional publication, according to Andres Guarnizo, USG’s academic director and a senior majoring in communication.
Guarnizo views this new deal as an avenue for students to become more informed from a variety of perspectives.
“We want to give them a variety of mediums to access news,” Guarnizo said. “Having a choice is the best thing possible. … It makes a well-rounded individual to be informed of the news.”
USA Today approached USG with its collegiate readership program. The goal of the program is to promote civic literacy and global awareness on campus through daily exposure to the news, according to the USA Today website. Each day the publication will give USG 300 newspapers to put on newsstands.
Guarnizo believes having print newspapers on campus will make students more inclined to stay informed with local and world events.
“Not everyone is willing to seek out news, so when the hard copy is there people will pick it up and maybe read it when eating lunch and then keep it with them throughout the day,” Guarnizo said.
USG President Mikey Geragos, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, views the program as an example of USG’s commitment to students’ needs.
“It’s a program that a lot of other schools did that we were really behind in,” Geragos said.
USG is looking into forming connections with The Wall Street Journal and other publications that approach them with a readership program.

Thomas de Waal shared his knowledge of the turbulent South Caucasus region in a discussion held at Leavey Library Auditorium on Thursday.
Experienced · Thomas de Waal emphasizes the importance of neutral nations stepping in to end conflicts in the Caucasus region. – Zhaoyu Zhou | Daily Trojan
De Waal touched on his experience living and working in countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, but the majority of his talk focused on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Karabakh region, which started in the early 1990s.
De Waal worked as a journalist and writer in the Caucasus and Black Sea regions for news outlets such as BBC World Service in London and BBC Radio. He is currently a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment and has written extensively on the South Caucasus.
As a backdrop to the discussion, de Waal characterized the relationship between the countries of the Caucasus and powerful nations like the United States and Russia as one of mistrust between the small Caucasian nations and larger nations that eventually get pulled into conflict.
“Petty interests triumph any sense of regional identity,” de Waal said. “[The Caucasian nations] have a local dispute and you feel threatened, then you call upon your great power patron [Russia or the United States] to protect you, and your neighbor calls on his great power patron to protect him, and a small squabble escalates into a large conflict.”
He warned against the broadly accepted view of powerful nations controlling the nations of the Caucasus, and instead suggested the Caucasian nations play the major powers off each other.
“The central part of my writing is to push back against the idea of the Caucasus as a chessboard for the United States and Russia to play on, and suggest the opposite,” de Waal said. “These are people that have 500 years of experience playing major powers off each other. The Caucasian nations are exerts at drawing the great powers into their own conflicts.”
With this backdrop, he went on to discuss the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict over the Karabakh region. He highlighted fear and mistrust as the principal initial causes of the conflict. The Russian policy of strict control did not allow history to be discussed — as a result, the individual societies created their own conflicting narratives about Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Karabakh region.
“This is a conflict that has no moral bias toward one side or the other,” de Waal said. “Both sides were afraid of each other, so you had a conflict born more out of fear than greed or grievance.”
But looking forward, however, de Waal expressed optimism regarding the involvement of a neutral party such as the United States, Russia or the European Union, the conflict could be solved.
“There needs to be less assistance and more coercion from a powerful arbiter,” he said.

Students of a number of different faiths participated Thursday in the eighth annual Fastathon from sunrise to sundown.
The event, which USC’s Ansar Service Partnership and several other religious organizations sponsored, holds a collective fast every year to raise money and awareness for the homeless and hungry populations in Los Angeles. The fast concluded at sundown with a feast held at USC’s newly rebuilt Caruso Catholic Center.

For coordinators of the event, Fastathon represents more than a simple day of fasting.
“All of the Fastathon’s profits go exclusively to humanitarian efforts,” said Faaria Kalam, president of the Ansar Service Partnership, the primary host organization of the event. Supporters of the Fastathon reached out to local businesses for donations to sponsor the fast. Subsequently, all proceeds from these donations are then given to the ILM foundation, an organization that feeds Los Angeles’ burgeoning homeless population.
“The Fastathon’s purpose is multifaceted. Each year ILM holds their humanitarian day, where they’ll serve over 10,000 homeless people in Los Angeles, and our students will also volunteer at humanitarian day,” Kalam said. “By going hungry for a day, we can experience the plight of the homeless. We can make sure that others don’t go hungry.”
In addition to the fundraising and awareness that Fastathon brings to its participants, many also note that the fast strengthens campus interfaith ties.
“The purpose of our fast is to engage in a spiritual practice shared by many faiths that allows us to focus more on what’s really important,” said Katherine Schofield, the minister for campus engagement at the United University Church, another co-sponsor of the event. “We do so much consuming in our lives that it’s imperative to take some time to consider the real things that we should be surrounding ourselves with. In a sense, our own hunger reminds us of the hunger of others.”
While Fastathon began eight years ago as a solely Muslim-based effort by the predominately Muslim Ansar Service Project, this year’s fast is the first that is co-sponsored by several other organizations of many faiths, including the Caruso Catholic Center, the United University Church, USC Hillel, the Hindu Student Organization, USC Residential Education and the Office of Religious Life.
“This year we’re doing our event bigger than ever before. Usually only Muslim people come out to support us. However, this is the first time we have actively gone out to all of the university organizations to co-sponsor because we understand that the Fastathon is a diversity learning experience,” Kalam said. “We want to create an openness to religious diversity at USC and we want students to understand that poverty exists in America regardless of religion. Hunger doesn’t have a god.”
The event’s new location lends yet another hand to the aim of interfaith understanding at the Fastathon. Sergio Avelar, the pastoral council chair at the USC Caruso Catholic Center, said he believes that holding the event at the Catholic Center will help expand the appeal and audience of the event.
“In the past, the Fastathon was always held at the mosque on Vermont and Exposition. However, ASP reached out to us to host the Fastathon banquet at our new Catholic Center,” Avelar said. “This change of location gives a chance for the interfaith community to check us out.”
Fastathon provides USC students of all faiths with the opportunity to fast for the well-being of others, but also highlights the relationship between faith and community service.
“It’s important to draw attention to hunger in our community, and important to recognize how faith can be a basis for approaching issues of social justice,” Schofield said. “ASP deserves a lot of recognition for the wonderful work they do to support and to serve the community through this event.”
Some students who fasted for the event said the community service aspect of the event was what drew them to participate.
“We thought it was for a good cause,” said Ada Wong, a freshman majoring in business administration. “If you go hungry for a day someone else doesn’t have to.”
Alisa Bealessio, a freshman majoring in physics, said she found the event fulfilling and would participate in future events.
“I’d do it in the future,” Bealessio said. “It’s not difficult to fast for one day for a good cause.”

Philanthropists Frank and Jill Fertitta donated an undisclosed amount of money to establish a new state-of-the-art instructional building and an endowed faculty chair, the USC Marshall School of Business announced Thursday.
Fertitta Hall, which is believed to increase Marshall’s undergraduate student capacity by nearly one-third, will be built at the intersection of Figueroa Street and Exposition Drive. Construction for the new building is expected to begin May 2014 and is slated for completion in Fall 2016.
“The generous and visionary support of Jill and Frank Fertitta will dramatically expand our facilities, as well as the teaching and learning opportunities at USC Marshall,” Marshall Dean James G. Ellis said in a statement.
The school plans to use the gift, which will also establish the USC Jill and Frank Fertitta Endowed Chair in Business, to continue recruiting faculty members that will promote entrepreneurship and innovation to its students.
Frank Fertitta, an alumnus of USC’s 1984 class, is the chairman and CEO of Fertitta Entertainment, a company that develops and manages resorts and casinos, and Station Casinos, the largest provider of gaming entertainment in Southern Nevada. In addition, Frank Fertitta is the principal owner of Zuffa LLC, which owns the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Frank and Jill Fertitta’s daughter, Kelley-Ann, is a recent graduate of USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Though Jill and Frank Fertitta donate to a wide variety of organizations, they said they were excited to have the opportunity to support USC.
“I am grateful to the university for the outstanding educational opportunities I received at USC Marshall, and to experience this once again as a Trojan parent,” Frank Fertitta said in a statement. “Jill and I are proud and very pleased to be able to give back to USC, and to future generations whose careers will be shaped at USC Marshall.”

Following two presidential debates, Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama have been scrutinized not only for what they have said, but how they have said it. This does not refer merely to tone or volume; American viewers also take cues from a candidate’s facial expressions, movement and posture.
Body language is not without significance in the presidential debates. In fact, it might be just as important as the substance of the speeches themselves.
Some research suggests that the candidates’ words have a larger impact on voters than their body language. A recent study conducted by the Journal of Communication found that viewers of a German presidential debate felt verbal elements had a stronger impact on their reactions.
The influence of nonverbal subtleties, however, should not be underestimated. Research conducted by Boston College pyscho-physiologist Joseph Tecce shows that the candidate who blinks more during debates has lost every presidential election since 1980. The only exception is the 2000 election, when the winning candidate, George Bush, lost the popular vote.
Body language plays an important role in media perception as well. The more anxious the candidate, the faster he blinks and the grander he gestures. A recent CNN article showed while substance is crucial, many Americans also tune in to how the candidates appear as they present their material.
Governor Romney was awarded the win in the first presidential debate by most major news media outlets. He also blinked about 1,300 times less than his opponent, according to Tecce.
In the second debate, however, Obama prevailed with more positive non-verbal signals. ABC news analysts pointed out Romney’s insecure stance while Obama made jabs at his tax plan. They also noted how during the last minutes of the debate, Romney “walked stiffly and let his hands hang at his sides.”
Even according to Tecce’s, method it’s too soon to predict who will be victorious in the 2012 election. Next Monday’s foreign policy debate is definitely one to keep ears—and eyes—open for.

Women at Miami University received a nasty surprise last week when a flier emerged in a men’s bathroom of a co-ed freshman dorm describing the “Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape.”
The flier featured suggestions from slipping drugs into a girl’s drink to climbing through a girl’s open window, and concluded with a rallying cry for college boys to “live it up” and take advantage of their unique situation while they still can.
The university has filed a police report about the incident and launched an official investigation. But finding the person responsible for the flier alone is not going to stop the dangerous nonchalant attitude towards sexual violence dominant on today’s college campuses.
If the flier was intended to be serious, that’s just scary.
More likely, however, it was written by some juvenile freshman trying to get a laugh. But when did violation of a woman’s body and dignity suddenly become so funny?
Apparently, it always has been. We see it on our own campus. Open mic night at Ground Zero features a regular barrage of rape jokes—always by male comedians. Students indiscriminately make comments about sexual assault intended as “humorous,” without considering what people in earshot might have gone through in their pasts.
Unforgettable, of course, is the repulsive viral email that spread through USC’s Greek Community in March of 2011. The email contained blatant sexism, racism, body policing and—of course—justification for sexual assault, and was written, according to the author, by a member of USC’s chapter of the Kappa Sigma fraternity.
Even Facebook started as a way to compare the attractiveness of girls at Harvard College, and audiences laughed heartily at that when the 2010 film The Social Network came out in theaters.
The American Association of American Women reports that three percent of college women are victims of rape or attempted rape every year and that 95 percent of sexual assaults at or around college campuses are unreported.
These alarming statistics will not change until the culture of permissiveness changes. Sexual violence is never funny—not in a café, not with friends and certainly not on a flier.

As a reward to its loyal followers, Classical KUSC has developed Soundsnips, a new interactive app that allows listeners to learn more about classical music on and off the station.

Dedicated to making classical music a more integral part of people’s lives, KUSC was in search of a vehicle to galvanize people of all musical palates. Through Soundsnips, released Aug. 23, KUSC reaches a large audience — especially the milennial audience, which could be a bit more exposed to classical music. Even those who might think they are not partial to classical music might find a new appreciation for Haydn and Mozart through Soundsnips. When it comes to this enlightening, user-friendly tool and app, there is something for everyone.
Chris Mendez, the director of KUSC Interactive, played a large role in the development of Soundsnips. With the intent of attracting new media-focused audiences, the KUSC Interactive team wanted to provide users with a hassle-free way to learn about the music they were hearing.
“We were trying to get to the question of how to make classical music, in particular, more accessible to audiences and provide them with a new way to hear music,” Mendez said. “We found that [with Soundsnips], when we listen to something as interesting as Bach or Debussy, we can understand what is happening in the mechanics of it all. It makes the music more enjoyable and easier to appreciate in a whole new way.”
Though the app provides users with a large supply of classical music knowledge, Soundsnips is as simple and straightforward as it gets. After the splash page, the navigation menu displays four main periods in music to choose from: Baroque, Classical, Romantic and 20th Century. Looking for a specific artist? Not a problem. Just sort through the artist list, which ranges from Bach to Vivaldi.
Then pick a song, sit back and listen. Debussy’s “La Mer,” for instance, is a dreamy composition emulating the ebb and flow of the sea and conjures up a majestic, shining quality. Then there is Beethoven’s high-energy “Piano Sonata No. 8 in C Minor,” a fast-paced but delicate piece that showcases the maestro’s musical innovation and creativity. While the song plays, informative notes, akin to VH1’s classic “Pop-Up Videos,” appear onscreen, giving insight into songs that are being played.
“It’s a one-click music player. You can listen to music as you normally do, but if you wanted to learn something [about the piece], all you have to do is go to the app itself,” Mendez said.
The app, through these pop-ups, provides commentary on some of classical music’s most notable pieces and a rhetorical glimpse into the minds of these illustrious composers. The commentary on “La Mer” explains Debussy’s use of elaborate harmonies as a way “to simultaneously depict majesty and mystery here, threading a chromatic line through a huge, rich chord.” And on Beethoven’s “Piano Sonata No. 8 in C Minor,” the commentary informs listeners that “the final major-key episode is in C major and drips with sarcasm in its exaggerated playfulness, setting up the final explosive, agitated return of the rondo theme.”
Besides the simplicity and educational and entertainment values of Soundsnips, there’s an added bonus: It’s free.
“You don’t have to download any music [with this app] or purchase the download,” Mendez said. “We’ve already gone through the effort of providing royalty-free music that you can listen to.”
But even without the fuss and fees of having to download songs, the Soundsnips music library is somewhat limited. Soundsnips currently offers a condensed, yet influential, selection of songs — around 30 to 40 high-quality classical pieces. But the KUSC Interactive Team is currently working to expand the Soundsnips song library. Another installment of new content is scheduled to launch in a couple weeks.
“We’re particularly excited to introduce our users to one of Mozart’s most important quartets and highlighting how early America inspired some of Dvorak’s work,” Mendez said.
Even during the glory days of pop stars such as Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry, KUSC does its best to preserve classical music and its legacy. Combining music dating back to the 17th century with technology of the 21st century, Soundsnips is an app that exceeds the limits of time and music.
More ways to make classical music accessible is a good thing! 
I hope the app also has a good way to integrate live music events. There are so many amazing opportunities to see live music in this city – I work with LA Phil, so I’m a bit biased – but it would be great to see more students at classical performances. There are so many young people *making* amazing music in town.
In case anyone is interested, the full Walt Disney Concert Hall season is here http://www.laphil.com. This weekend there’s an awesome concert http://laphil.com/Korngold. It’s described as “lush and loving, dark and dangerous” which works for me this close to Halloween! Music from Korngold and Mahler

Forty years following the release of Harvest and three weeks after the harvest moon, Neil Young and Crazy Horse took to the Hollywood Bowl stage as part of the group’s expansive North American “Alchemy” arena tour — its first after an eight-year hiatus. The set featured old favorites such as “Cinnamon Girl” and “The Needle and the Damage Done,” as well as fresh songs off of the October release Psychedelic Pill and the upcoming album Americana.
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated Psychedelic Pill was released in June. The album’s release date was in October.]
The Bowl proved an appropriate setting Wednesday night for the group’s exploration of its back catalogue. It was a night of unapologetic nostalgia, as Young battled 21st-century short attention spans with 10-minute, long-form grunge pieces like “Love & Only Love.” He and his group also lamented the death of the ’60s in new tunes like “Walk Like A Giant.”
The median age of the crowd was, as expected, around 40 or 50 — a mixture of Young romantics, ex-Dead Heads and those who didn’t make it to Woodstock in ’69 and hoped to recreate the experience. Young acknowledged his audience’s age with an arch “welcome back” by way of hello.
The show itself was choreographed like a journey back in time. As opening act Los Lobos left the stage to a standing ovation, a theatrical cluster of neon orange-clad construction workers and mad scientists in white swept in to prepare for Young.
Large cardboard edifices of old-fashioned luggage, which boasted the Canadian maple leaf symbol, rose to reveal three towering Fender amplifiers, sending the whole Bowl through a time machine. What sounded like an old live recording of the group then filled the arena, reached a crescendo and finally waned as Young and Horse took the stage.
Instead of grabbing for their guitars, the group lined up before a gigantic American flag to sing a brief (and somewhat baffling) national anthem — a nod to the group’s upcoming folk album, Americana.
Young and guitarist Frank Sampedro jammed masterfully together for several minutes before Young took the microphone to tell of a battle of old between love and hate in “Love & Only Love.” Young assured his audience from the start that love would always prevail, but the declaration was accompanied by an unmistakable sense of desperation.
With guitarist Sampedro in a Jimmy Hendrix T-shirt and Young handling a beat-up black Les Paul, it was clear that the band’s vision of America is now tinted with, at the very least, a degree of aged wistfulness, and, more likely, bitterness and regret.
It was therefore fitting, and hardly subtle, when Young intoned, “I used to walk like a giant on the land” while Canadian luggage loomed menacingly over the fenders, on which were projected ’60s psychedelic light sequences.
These lyrics, from the song “Walk Like a Giant,” off the upcoming release Pill, made sense of the heavy grunge sound which had marked a huge departure for Young in the ’70s when he reacted to the rise of punk. Wailing that he feels “like a leaf floating in a stream,” it seems that Young is now trying to jam his way back to the stifled power of rock.
The ghost of Hendrix-era rock truly manifested itself when the stage backdrop changed from the Crazy Horse logo to that of the 1969 Woodstock festival: a white dove perched on the neck of an acoustic guitar. For those in the crowd that wanted Woodstock Revisited, they’d surely found it here.
The problem, however, was that the performers had already seen the horrors of Altamont, a 1969 rock concert that quickly turned violent and ended with the deaths of four civilians.
Commanding an arena of adoring fans, jamming hundreds of feet below the waving spotlights, Young sang of a particular species of giant, now perhaps extinct. He sang about the kinds of giants who almost changed the world in 1969. He took his timid, well-preserved voice to a roar, attempting to whammy his way back to that day — despite Altamont, despite the Reagan years and despite the fade on the disc jacket of rock ‘n’ roll.
A postmodern baby could laugh — the sonic boom at the end of “Walk Like A Giant” sounded almost like an homage to Spinal Tap’s “Stonehenge” — but Young’s invocation was unmistakable: We need the power of rock.
In a sharp change, Young went acoustic for renditions of the beloved “The Needle And The Damage Done” and “Twisted Road,” a new tune about the first time he heard Bob Dylan’s “Like A Rolling Stone.” The latter has a new video with old footage of Dylan and the Grateful Dead.
Jokingly, Young said he was aiming to get onto the Top 40 with his finale, which turned out to be the group’s classic “My My, Hey Hey (Into The Black).” Delivering the grand thesis of his days with Crazy Horse, Young cried over his guitar, “Rock and roll can never die. … It’s better to burn out than fade away,” as he sent the crowd out of the blue and into the black of the night.
I would have to disagree with your characterization of the show as a nostalgia fest. Very few other artists of Neil Young’s age concentrate so heavily on new material, and indeed, though it was of a piece with his older classic material, it shows him to be an artist pushing forward. Additionally, Psychadelic Pill is his forthcoming album and Americana, which is an electric album, is already out; also, they walked out to the Beatles’ ‘A Day In The Life’.
Thanks for you response, Asher. I’m speaking mainly about the content and themes of his material. The nature of his new music, lyrically, is reflective. For the sake of word count I had to leave out that Young closed with “Mr. Soul,” which he performed with Buffalo Springfield at the Bowl in I believe 1967 or 68. I don’t mean to say that nostalgia is a bad thing. Young clearly hopes to reclaim 60s idealism for the 21st century and I personally think that that’s essential!
In terms of release dates…there are several unfortunate errors (“Jimmy” Hendrix?) that are just part of the hectic editing process of a daily newspaper. But “Americana” consists of mainly folk songs, which can be performed in any style. I did conflate the before-show music selection for the sake of length; if they actually entered to “A Day In The Life,” which I do remember hearing, then that’s my mistake and should be noted.

It can be hard to agree on what constitutes a “seminal work.” Not many pieces of media are influential enough to leave a noticeable and lasting impact on our culture, and of course the ones that do usually had influences of their own.
But few singular releases have done more to affect a genre than George A. Romero’s Night of the Living Dead, which forever changed horror by introducing the modern zombie to the world.

Reanimated and rotting, these cannibalistic corpses have shambled their way into virtually every facet of horror-based entertainment since their 1968 debut. Onscreen, they’ve had a steady presence over their 4 1/2  decade history filled with the continuation of Romero’s Living Dead series and a legion of imitators. By now, the zombie movie is a full-blown sub-genre, composed of films such as 28 Days Later, Zack Snyder’s remade Dawn of the Dead, and even comedies such as Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland.
But in recent years, other forms of media have really seen the trend proliferate. Nowhere are zombies more ubiquitous than in video games, which — given their ability to provide hundreds of easily programmable cannon fodder enemies that make for deeply satisfying, guilt-free eradication — are a natural home for the undead. It would be one thing if zombies were contained to popular franchises like Left 4 Dead and Dead Rising that are entirely built around concepts of the undead, but the popularity of gunning down mindless, reanimated foes hasn’t stopped there.
It seems that many video game developers have taken the position that there’s nothing quite so marketable as adding zombies to a game that didn’t have them before. Rockstar Studio’s Old West shooter Red Dead Redemption now has an “Undead Nightmare” expansion and the already popular Call of Duty series combines the two most common video game adversaries with its “Nazi Zombies” mode, now a mainstay of the franchise.
No matter how many gamers insist they’re tired of zombies on blogs or online polls, the trend continues because these games sell; Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and The Last of Us are two of the most anticipated game releases in the coming weeks, and sure enough both have their fair share of walking corpses.
But for the clearest example of zombies at their popularity peak, we need to look no further than television, specifically AMC’s The Walking Dead, which  premiered on Halloween 2010. At the time it might have seemed like a risky move to produce an ongoing television series about the zombie apocalypse — a setting rarely fleshed out beyond standalone films. But after the success of Robert Kirkman’s Walking Dead comic book series, AMC, a network that had set a precedent for taking gambles on unconventional premises with Breaking Bad and Mad Men, took a risk that has paid off better than they ever could have expected.
The Walking Dead’s third season premiere broke records last Sunday when it garnered a staggering 10.9 million viewers. Those are higher ratings than any series this fall, and not just for those airing on cable channels but on major networks as well. And that’s with the extra handicap of DISH customers losing access to AMC; with The Walking Dead, the station has now proved that much of the perceived commercial disparity between broadcast and cable networks is a thing of the past. Television might never be the same, and it’s all because of zombies.
So what makes them so appealing, anyway? What is it about the undead that captures our attention? It might very well go back to the very basic notion of “the other,” the need to define ourselves as human against an inhuman point of comparison. To that end, what’s more convenient than the zombie? They have the body of humans, but they lack anything approximating recognizable intelligence or what might be called a soul.
Beyond that base psychological effect, the whole notion of the zombie apocalypse inspires a huge amount of active engagement from fans in response to one simple question: What would they do if the dead rose from their graves with an appetite for human flesh? While it might be ridiculous to plan for a zombie outbreak, the notion remains irresistible. Every piece of media with zombies causes audiences to put themselves in that position and to try to do better, to last longer.
It plays into the simple need to survive, triggering that unspoken belief that we could transform into an action hero at a moment’s notice. Books like The Zombie Survival Guide and the newly released This Book is Full of Spiders address this desire directly by taking place in a metafictional world where everyone is already wary of attacking zombies and reacts to the outbreak accordingly.
It’s a fantasy that’s spilling into the real world with “zombie runs,” events where everyone dresses up like a corpse and stumbles around, moaning for brains or human flesh. USC has one coming on Nov. 4 — sponsored by the Lutheran Campus Ministry of all organizations. A couple hundred would-be zombies will descend upon the campus and force everyone to realize that while the undead might not be real, their appeal is plenty infectious enough.

Sandwiched between Chipotle and Quizno’s on South Figueroa Street, Midori Go serves up fast food counter-cafeteria style. Occupying the former location of the California Grill, the Japanese spot, which is roughly two months old, possesses an interior aesthetic that’s clean and sleek and boasts a futuristic and modern menu.
Sushi al fresco · New Japanese fast-food restaurant Midori Go focuses on sushi, the offerings of which are average. One would be wise to order sides of mussels and beef bowls, both options that provide more flavor. – Alec Faulkner | Daily Trojan
Midori Go specializes in sushi dishes, so connoisseurs of Japanese cuisine seeking noodle or curry dishes will be disappointed. But the variety is solid nonetheless, with a selection of sides, bowls and bento boxes in addition to the sushi menu offerings.
Despite this solid menu, some inconsistencies prevail.
Aside from a handful of barstools at a window counter inside, diners must opt for outdoor seating given the restaurant’s modest size.
But Midori Go’s interior isn’t the only thing that’s small. Orders taken “for here” just might be received in a “to-go” container of either plastic or styrofoam, which in turn might be comically over-sized given the meager portions of food inside.
Still, the main factor of which Midori Go should be judged, the quality of its food, is variable.
The salmon skin roll, from the substantial list of specialty rolls on the menu, is excellent. The salmon skin itself is flavorful and deliciously stretchy, and the addition of cucumber is subtle and refreshing. And the rice, so often a failure at fast-Asian joints, tastes moist and fresh here.
The “Yummy Roll,” a specialty containing salmon and tempura flakes but centered on “masago,” or capelin roe, is appreciatively straightforward. Those who enjoy the somewhat savory taste of fish eggs enough to tolerate its mushy conglomeration will enjoy this roll.
The spicy scallop roll is a good option for diners who make a point of seeking out spicy dishes. With plenty of flavor and texture, the spicy scallop roll’s impact can, as is ever the case with Japanese cuisine, be magnified with a judicious or even reckless application of wasabi.
Perhaps best of all, though, the specialty rolls all seem appropriately priced at either $6 or $9.
From the smaller menu simply labeled “SUSHI,” the salmon and tuna sushi dishes consist of slices of raw fish on balls of rice, served with sauces on the side. The options are fine, if not exciting, and the same can be said of their execution.
The fish itself tends toward either blandness or, when interlaid with lemon slices, overpowering bitterness.
Of course, this is probably meant to be remedied by dipping the sushi in the sauces provided, although diners with sturdy taste buds and a passion for strong flavors might prefer to slather the sauces on their sushi, instead.
It would be charitable to simply say that the sides at Midori Go are also not a strong suit. The edamame, a frequent snack staple of Japanese cuisine, are small and flavorless.
The vegetable tempura that accompanies some of the dishes is soggy and lacks the crispiness and strong textural variety one craves.
The miso soup, for its part, isn’t necessarily bad, but does possess enough of an unusual aftertaste that further consumption seems unnecessary.
The side salads, for their part, are pretty good. The vegetables are appropriately fresh and crisp, and the dressing on the side is savory enough to bump the flavor profile up a notch — an accomplished  feat in the dismal world of fast-food side salads.
The baked mussels are an unusual and ambitious highlight of the side menu. The creamy sauce on top adds abundant flavor and spice to the tender meat beneath. And though not exactly filling for the price, those who can afford and enjoy the shellfish will appreciate balancing the more delicate flavors of the menu with this dish.
The bento boxes and rice bowls also make for surprisingly high-quality options.
The bulgogi beef bowl receives the highest recommendation, with beef that is tender, flavorful and well-seasoned, and onions that add an ever greater kick. With all the rice bowls at $6 or less, it’s probably also one of the better values to be had.
Finally, the beverage selection has a couple notable items. Aside from the small but expected selection of fountain sodas and bottled water, diners also have the options of canned green tea and the popular “how did they get the marble in the bottle?” ramune soda, giving a slight air of authenticity to the Japanese fast-food experience.
On its own, Midori Go would be an above-average, $10-or-less, fast-food alternative to burgers and subs, where one could hone in on a favorite dish and stop in periodically for a change of pace. In the greater context of USC, though, any new options are nothing short of a blessing, and Midori Go is no exception.

During Tuesday’s presidential debate, audience member Barry Green raised a unique question: As we approach the election, what are the biggest misconceptions associated with each candidate?
Neither candidate broke any new ground — they used Green’s question as an opportunity to reiterate some of their central campaign points — but the question remains relevant, particularly for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. This election has been rife with false accusations, misleading facts and flat-out lies stemming from both parties. Clarifying what is and isn’t true will allow voters to make more informed decisions come Nov. 6.

A major misconception, which was also addressed in another audience member’s question, is that, because Romney is running under the Republican ticket, his term in office would be a repeat of former President George W. Bush’s administration. This, however, is far from the truth. Though Bush and Romney support tax cuts to boost the economy, Romney has promised to keep the budget deficit neutral for his presidency. The tax cuts and economic policies of the Bush administration, according to many economists, were major causes of the recession. Romney’s budget plans are far more realistic than Bush’s and would not lead to further economic crisis.
Even better, his plans aren’t too heavily conservative; another misconception persists that Romney stands too far to the right for his administration to run the country effectively. Though some of his social policies — his stance on gay marriage or abortion, for example — have been traditionally right-wing, when it comes to more far-reaching issues he’s surprisingly moderate. In a recent interview with The Des Moines Register, Romney stated that in his tax plan there will be no tax breaks for high-income taxpayers and that his focus would be to reduce the burden on middle-income Americans. In this respect, Romney shares this goal with Obama — and has a much sounder economic plan to back it up.
Romney has put substantial thought and definitive planning into his economic policy, though. What about topics where Romney’s position isn’t as fully formed and well-known? Educational reform, for example, is a pressing issue that many claim Romney has fallen short on. Specifically, he has been criticized for reducing the capacity for student loans. Though Romney, like many other Republicans, doesn’t support as much student aid as Obama, it doesn’t mean that he’s opposed to reforms that improve student livelihood and performance. In Tuesday’s debate, Romney said he “want[s] to make sure we keep our Pell Grant program growing,” as he professed the importance of improving the education system.
But Romney’s policies aren’t the only aspects of his campaign that have been misinterpreted. On a personal level, Romney has been criticized for being out of touch with the middle class and overly secretive about his wealth. Though it’s proven difficult for Romney to connect with the middle and lower classes, he’s shown nothing but improvement in the last two debates, promising to relieve taxes on lower tax brackets. It’s difficult for the multi-millionaire to appeal to lower-income families because he’s only experienced a life of wealth, not because he doesn’t care. In fact, in response to Green’s question, Romney emphasized that he cares about “100 percent of the American people.”
As the election approaches, there will be more and more opportunities for the candidates and media to botch facts and promote misconceptions. Until voters make their final decisions on Nov. 6, they should  take the information they receive with a grain of salt and educate themselves on who the candidates really are.

The final question of the second presidential debate was not about jobs, taxes or any of the usual suspects. The man who asked the question, Barry Green, asked President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to set voters straight about the biggest misconceptions held about each of them.
Neither candidate said anything new — Romney said he cares about 100 percent of people and will get the country working again, and Obama said he wants to level the playing field and will do better than the man who threw 47 percent of Americans to the wind. There are, however, other major misconceptions at play in this election, especially about Obama, that must be debunked before Election Day so the right man gets elected.
The first misconception — and the one most often used by the Romney campaign to sway voters — is that Obama didn’t get anything done in the last four years. It’s true that Obama made campaign promises in 2008 that he has failed to keep, but that is not because his character as a politician or a man.
The biggest 2012 campaign issue is easily the economy, and voters are dismayed that things haven’t improved financially since Obama took office. But Obama’s economic record has to be judged relative to the situation he inherited: the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. When thinking about Obama’s record, voters should keep this in mind and recognize that what he has accomplished in four years — sparking a resurgence in the auto industry and creating 4.5 million new jobs, among other improvements — is actually pretty admirable.
Obama also came into office at a time when America’s global reputation was suffering because of former President George W. Bush’s frequent foreign policy missteps, including the mistaken invasion of Iraq. Despite the fact that Obama inherited two wars that the international community vehemently opposed, he made great strides toward ending and repairing America’s damaged international reputation. Obama’s administration oversaw the assassination of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden last year, troop withdrawal from Iraq last December and a solid plan to end the war in Afghanistan by 2014.
Not to mention, pinning current crises in the Middle East on Obama (as the Romney campaign so often does) is based off the misperception that they are his administration’s wars. In actuality, they are Bush’s wars and Obama has sought to end them. Yet interestingly, many members of Bush’s team who advocated for these wars are now Romney advisers, such as former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael V. Hayden (a strong proponent of torture who was talented at covering up Bush-era torture tactics) and John Bolton, Bush’s United Nations ambassador (a neoconservative who was actually forced out during the second Bush administration for his extreme views on war).
Debunking foreign policy is one thing, but what about the way voters perceive the candidates to be on a personal level? Green asked Obama and Romney to set voters straight on misconceptions about each of them not only as candidates, but as men. Since Obama took office, he has often been accused of being cold and aloof for refusing to socialize as much as presidents normally do with lawmakers, Congress members or wealthy donors. Critics and supporters alike also characterized his first debate performance in this way. But this is a mistaken characterization that overlooks one of Obama’s most admirable qualities: his aversion to the Washington culture of sound bites and demagoguery where everything is about money and making quick, easy appeals to garner votes.
To misinterpret Obama’s lack of participation in this world as personal aloofness is to miss out on re-electing someone who offers a foil to the usual Washington narrative.
This close to Election Day, it’s safe to say most voters will probably not change their mind about which candidate they support. It’s a key time to re-evaluate the reasons behind this support, however, and to recognize any differences between misconception and truth.
