As development on the Ronald Tutor Campus Center nears its August 2010 deadline, one floor of the building still lacks the $4 million needed for its construction.
Project coordinators said they didn’t have the money to build the area when they first added the 11,000-sq. ft. space to campus center plans almost 10 years ago.
Stalled · Although the university paid for the walls and roof of the fourth floor of the campus center, the interior of the floor will not be completed until more money is raised. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
Since then, they have hoped for a generous donation to complete Wing B’s fourth floor, which they hope will one day house student groups such as the Undergraduate Student Government and Program Board in a new Student Leadership Development Center.
“There has always been this desire to pull all the student involvement aspects together,” said Patrick Bailey, assistant dean and director of Student Life and Involvement. “Not only could resources be shared, but everyone could actually collaborate together. In the years of programming, that was always an element.”
But right now, the Student Leadership Development Center is only an idea. The center will remain an empty shell without walls, doors, ceilings or utilities, for however long it takes to raise the needed construction and furnishing costs. From the outside, however, it will look as polished and complete as the rest of the building.
“We always knew from day one we were never going to be able to finish this [in time],” Bailey said. Originally, the university’s budget for the L-shaped campus center covered up to three stories on one wing and four stories on the other, Bailey said.
University regulations prevented the building from being taller than four stories. The regulations allowed one additional floor that could still be built on the second wing of the building without surpassing university height guidelines.
Student Affairs officials, who had hoped to put a new student leadership center into the building, said they saw an opportunity in the potential fourth floor of the second wing. The problem was, the university had no money for the floor, Bailey said.
“The university agreed to build the fourth floor as a shell space,” Bailey said. “It wasn’t going to cost any more money because they weren’t going to finish it.”
The university paid for the walls and roof of the fourth-floor area, but the $4-million cost for the rest of the floor now falls to Student Affairs.
Bailey said finishing the fourth floor is probably not a financial possibility before the center’s August 2010 opening. The floor’s completion, which has no timeline, depends on fundraising and donations.
Jason Cruz, project coordinator for Student Life and Involvement, said they hoped it would be ready to open at the same time as the rest of the building.
“But that probably won’t happen,” Cruz said. “For us, it is just the sooner, the better.”
Once completed, the fourth floor of Wing B will house the new Student Leadership Development Center, which is designed to bring leadership organizations and student groups together.
The floor will consist of offices for the Graduate and Professional Students Senate, the Panhellenic Council and other leadership organizations, and will also host special lectures, workshops and events to help students hone on their leadership skills, Bailey said.
“Right now we are focusing on development efforts,” Bailey said. “The funding is what will start the process, and then we would go into the programming and design phase.”
Bailey said nothing is finalized yet and many things about the center are still subject to change.
Other complications include rearranging office space in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center once the fourth floor opens. If the money is raised, then USG, for example, will move from its second-floor office — where it will move in the fall — to the fourth floor, Bailey said.
“It’s an annoyance to move,” said USG President Holden Slusher. “It doesn’t make sense from my perspective for us to move into the office and get settled and then move again … but I think the center will be worth the move just because we will be so intertwined with other leaders.”
Student Affairs has already started promoting the leadership center with fliers and webpages, some of which mention ways to support the leadership center’s construction.
Panhellenic, for example, was the first student organization to aid the fundraising efforts in supporting and promoting the leadership center with its Greek Gala event in April 2009, which raised $20,000.
“It is crucial we have funding for this,” Panhellenic President Blessing Waung said. “It would foster a whole other bubble of student activities; all these creative undergraduates together in one place would be incredible.”
Panhellenic, currently housed in the Student Union, will move to the campus center once the Leadership Center is complete.
“Even after I graduate I am committed to helping finish this project,” Waung said. “I just want to see it happen for all the future students. I really think it is something that will change our entire campus.”
Yet as long as the center lacks funding, the space will remain empty and the student leadership groups will remain scattered across campus.
“We are always looking for funding,” Bailey said. “We are hopeful that when we get the money we will finish this as a student leadership space.”

President Steven B. Sample, who has guided USC’s ascension through the academic, philanthropic and economic ranks for 19 years, announced Monday he will be stepping down in August.
“It has been a calling, an all-consuming passion to move this university ahead farther and faster than any other university in the United States,” Sample said in a statement released by USC. “We have been blessed to have pursued this mission in the company of many colleagues and friends who share our commitment to USC’s advancement. Our years here have simply been exhilarating.”

And in fact, Sample arguably has moved the university ahead farther and faster than any other president in the school’s history. During his storied tenure, USC’s acceptance rate has plummeted as SAT scores and qualifications have soared. He has boosted the school’s global outreach — particularly around the Pacific Rim, helped create plans for a dramatic expansion, oversaw the most successful fundraising campaign in higher education history and helped attract more highly qualified faculty members than ever before.
USC’s endowment — though it has slipped a bit in the last year — grew to nearly $4 billion under Sample. Seven professional schools were named for donors in the past 10 years. And five donations of more than $100 million — the most of that size to any school — have been given. As Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said, Sample will be missed.
“President Sample will be remembered as one of America’s greatest and visionary university leaders,” Jackson wrote in an email. “Under his guidance and pursuit of excellence, USC has become an international powerhouse that students from all around the globe want to attend … We will miss him.”
Under Sample’s leadership, USC has transformed into a renowned research university with a wide reach. Not only has the quality of the student body improved, but the increasingly academic focus has made the school more attractive to both students and faculty.
“Steven Sample has been a transformative leader for USC,” Alexander Capron, president of the faculty, wrote in an email. “The university his successor will inherit is radically different than the one President Sample found when he arrived two decades ago from Buffalo [N.Y.]. From the faculty viewpoint, he set up a virtuous cycle: Better students led to a better reputation and more resources.”
The students are undeniably more qualified. SAT scores have risen 300 points over Sample’s 19-year tenure. The graduation rate has jumped from around 60 percent to nearly 90 percent. USC now enrolls 232 National Merit Scholars; 19 years ago, it hosted just 33.
These more academically accomplished students, also come from a wider variety of geographical locations. As a result, USC has been transformed from a commuter campus to a residential one.
“The faculty have benefited from USC becoming ‘The Living University,’ with increasingly residential and vibrant campuses, deep engagement with the community, the region and the world, and a clear recognition of the need for greater sustainability in all we do,” Capron wrote.
Though the university community has expanded to encompass students from across the world — USC boasts the largest international population of any school — President Sample kept focus on the community close to home, too.
Sample oversaw the creation of the Good Neighbors Program, which asks faculty and staff to donate a portion of their salaries to community outreach programs. He also spearheaded the development of the Master Plan, which will guide USC’s development during the next 30 years. William Tierney, the director of USC’s Center for Higher Education Policy Analysis, said this is one of Sample’s top achievements.
“His major accomplishments include reframing how universities should work with local communities, rethinking what students should major in and study, and providing faculty and staff with a strategic direction and a sense of optimism,” Tierney wrote in an email.
These steps — bettering academics, economics and outreach — have faculty members believing Sample’s time at USC will not soon be forgotten.
“Sample has done an incomparable job of bringing this university into the front ranks of American higher education,” Geneva Overholser, director of the Annenberg School of Journalism, wrote in an email. “The advances, both academically and fiscally, during his long tenure have been extraordinary. He’s earned a change of pace, for sure, and it will be exciting to see what the next chapter brings.”
Tierney added that he thinks Sample will be known as one of the top five university presidents of the past half-century.
With the announcement of his retirement, the Board of Trustees will begin searching for the university’s next president. The Los Angeles Times reported that Executive Vice President and Provost C.L. Max Nikias is one of the top contenders.
Board of Trustees Chairman Edward P. Roski Jr. said choosing Sample’s successor will be no small task.
“Dr. Sample has engineered the most dramatic rise in quality and ranking of any American university,” Roski said in a press release. “From the very start he understood the entrepreneurial zeal of USC and fueled our desire to be excellent … And the results have been nothing short of spectacular. Filling his shoes will be a big job for the trustees.”
Sample will be missed not just because of his contributions to the university, but also because of his personal character.
“Not only is he a brilliant leader, he is kind and makes you feel that you can accomplish anything if you stay focused,” Jackson wrote. “He leaves a great legacy and it is our responsibility to build on it so that future generations of Trojans can benefit from the resources of our great university.”

Many with their ear to the USC administration have been speculating for a few years now that President Steven B. Sample would be stepping down, but Monday’s announcement that he will be retiring in August was a bombshell nonetheless.
Sample’s retirement will mark the end of an era in which USC has evolved into a leading research university, and raises serious questions about the university’s future — chief among them whether Sample’s successor can maintain the level of success he established in his time as president.
Words of wisdom · President Steven B. Sample has taught a highly selective leadership course with management expert Warren Bemis. - Photo courtesy of USC
Over the last two decades, Sample has had a
wide-ranging effect on the university. He has catapulted its academic standards, expanded its outreach into the community and made it a destination for students in dozens of states and dozens of countries.
And Sample’s prolific fundraising efforts have enabled the significant capital improvements that give USC’s campus a vastly different face from that of 20 years ago.
The impact of many of Sample’s accomplishments may not be clear for years. But after nearly two decades, his influence is felt in nearly every aspect of university life, and his retirement will leave a gaping hole in the president’s office.
Sample’s announcement was hardly shocking. His Parkinson’s disease has grown worse in recent years; at one event in Washington, DC last spring, the president’s hand shook violently at times, although his voice remained sturdy during a speech to alumni. The university also announced that Sample would not be teaching his popular leadership class this year, claiming it was retooling the curriculum.
Sample said the disease was not a major factor in his decision to step down from his post, according to the Los Angeles Times. Instead, he said, he wanted to step down while he was ahead.
Whatever the reason, replacing a president like Sample will be no small task for the university. The Board of Trustees will likely approach leading university figures across the country and even look internationally in its effort to find a successor by May.
But there are signs that USC may be looking within its own ranks. Although it is uncommon for major schools to promote a president from within, recent signs have pointed to Executive Vice President and Provost C.L. Max Nikias as a likely option.
Earlier this year, the university bumped Nikias’ title from provost to executive vice president. Board of Trustees Chairman Edward P. Roski Jr. also confirmed to the Los Angeles Times that Nikias was a contender for the position.
Either way, the next president will face a number of challenges in continuing the streak of success Sample established.
Sample’s successor will take over at a time when the university’s finances have taken a hit. The school is still in a hiring freeze, and its endowment has lost about $1.2 billion over the last year. The financial challenges have also affected the school’s ability to offer financial aid and its ability to expand.
If the USC of today looks fundamentally different than the one Sample inherited in 1991, then his successor will be facing a school that hardly resembles the USC of just five years ago.
Perhaps most significantly, the next president will be taking over at a key moment in the development of the university’s Master Plan, a framework for expanding the University Park Campus over the next few decades.
The proposed changes to student housing around campus, including creating 7,600 beds in the North University Park, could completely alter the look and feel of USC in the coming years and have a substantial impact on those that live in the neighborhood.
Sample made cooperation with the community a key aspect of his tenure, and his successor will have to grapple with the task of balancing the school’s physical growth and the changing nature of the Figueroa Corridor with the increasingly tenuous relationship with its neighbors.
As the board begins the search for a successor who can handle the complex task of managing a university with USC’s size, many are hoping Sample will continue to be a presence at the university and plan to use the rest of the year to bid farewell to the man who brought USC into the 21st century.
Thank you President Sample for the positive, dramatic changes you made. USC used to = “university of second choice” or “university of spoiled children,” but the envious ones across town also served as an inspiration. You changed USC’s image of a party school that catered to the wealthy and privileged, but now it’s one that attracts the academically competitive and ambitious. I hope your successor lifts up USC even more. Long live ‘SC!
Thank you President Sample for your exemplary commitment and dedication to USC. Your leadership will be missed. Best wishes for your return to teaching, and Fight On!

The Trojans may have been shocked after getting dismantled by Oregon on Saturday, but their subsequent dropp in the BCS standings couldn’t have come as much of a surprise.
After getting rocked 47-20 in Autzen Stadium, USC fell from No. 5 to No. 12 in the BCS rankings. Oregon now has the inside track to the Rose Bowl, but the Trojans may still qualify for an at-large BCS bid if they win their remaining four games and stay in the top 14.
The Ducks moved up two spots thanks to their impressive effort, from No. 10 to No. 8. Oregon did not jump Boise State (No.7), however, who handed the Ducks their only loss in the first game of the season.
Florida remains the top-rated team in the nation, while Texas is the new No. 2, jumping Alabama, who now sits at No. 3.
Iowa held onto the No. 4 ranking, despite playing poorly for most of its win over Indiana. Cincinnati jumped up to No. 5, bypassing Boise State and TCU (No. 6). LSU and Georgia Tech round out the top 10.
You gotta love the ignorant fans who know nothing about to the sport, but to cry and whine because there team gets no respect. We earned that respect, we earned those ‘votes’ when we win 7 rose bowls 2 NC’s and 7 pac 10 titles…. your going to get a little leeway obviously, lets not be oblivious.  I still feel like too many people talk about how we all think were invincible and we never lose. Talk to any USC fan about this year.  Freshman quarterback, young defense, and just about everyone is hurt right now.  Just because we did win for a long time, people automatically think all USC fans are errogant and mostly its just people who hate LA.  Well, keeping hating people, your only giving USC fans pleasure by getting angry and whining.  Also, if were such a terrible, overrated team, why does every team rush the field when they beat us? Will one team not rush the field and act as if they actually thought they would win the game? THAT would be refreshing
How in the heck does usc only drop to #12??? this makes no sense. they always lose to an unranked team, and now they get blown out badly and are only 2 spots away from top 10??
this is a conspiracy. usc sucks and their schedult is wack. they get votes just because of their name. and they can lose 5 games and the media/ poll voters would still keep them in the top 25. USC sucks. and if you are a USC Fan… in the words of chad ocho cinco… CHILD PLEASE!

Kristin Olsen came up big for the USC women’s soccer team.
She just couldn’t do it all.
On a night when offensive attacks were few and far between for USC, the Women of Troy couldn’t stop UCLA’s star-studded frontline as they fell 2-1.
Can’t do it all · Goalie Kristin Olsen did all she could to stop the UCLA attack, but the Women of Troy offense couldn’t stay in the game. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
No. 3 UCLA (15-2-1, 6-1-0) outshot No. 18 USC (12-6-0, 4-3-0) 19-7 Friday night in Westwood, and if it wasn’t for the play of senior goalkeeper Olsen — who had eight saves, many of them diving stops — it might have been worse for USC.
Olsen almost saved the Bruins’ game-winning goal in the 78th minute. UCLA’s freshman midfielder Chelsea Cline put a ball in behind the Women of Troy’s defense in a transition that senior Lauren Cheney collected and blasted past Olsen from six yards away for the game winner. Cheney appeared to be offside, but the linesman kept his flag down.
“It was a great shot, and I got a touch on it,” Olsen said. “It’s the worst feeling to get a touch on it and not save it.”
UCLA’s goal came just five minutes after the Women of Troy capitalized on great build-up play to equalize.
Junior defender Karter Haug started it off by playing a ball down the sideline for sophomore Ashley Freyer. Freyer ran onto it and passed it to freshman forward Samantha Johnson, who took it to the goaline. Johnson then passed the ball in front of the goal to freshman Courtney Garcia, who used her body position to slide and knock the ball past the goalkeeper.
“Garcia came in on the left side for us and gave them some problems,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “They had to move people around to try and handle that. Garcia showed up again, she’s been missing for a few games, and we’re happy that she came out, finally.”
The Women of Troy overcame a sluggish first half to bring the game level. The Bruins, with US National team member Cheney and speedy sophomore forward Sydney Leroux up top, came at the USC defense time and again, but they were turned away by Olsen.
On the flip side, USC failed to mount any significant attack in the first half, and it was UCLA who broke through in the 37th minute.
The Bruins took a short corner kick that Jenna Belcher played into the box. Nobody got a head onto it, and the ball bounced past Olsen into the goal.
“The first half, I think we came out real timid, real nervous, and we didn’t do anything we normally do,” Khosroshahin said.
USC looked better in the second half as it started spreading the ball wide. At halftime, the Women of Troy made it an objective to connect five passes in a row instead of trying to dribble at the defender. It worked as USC came to life in the second half and took it to UCLA.
“If we could get five passes, we knew we could get an attack,” Garcia said. “So once we got those five passes, we saw we got way more shots and the passing was working.”
Khosroshahin also moved junior outside midfielder Alyssa Dávila into the center mid-position, which made a difference. From there, the Women of Troy were able to attack the center and use combination play to threaten the Bruins’ defense.
“People started moving and wanting the ball. I thought [Dávila] came in and settled us down in central midfield,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s simple — we just need to be more consistent about it and believe we can beat anyone in the country, and we showed that in the second half.”
USC has two more games remaining during its regular season before NCAA tournament play begins. USC isn’t a surefire lock to make the tournament, so it will use this experience to improve. The Women of Troy said they know that if they meet UCLA down the road, they will be ready.
“We’re not quite done yet. It’s not the result we want, especially against [UCLA], but we’re going to get better from this experience. I give you my word,” Khosroshahin said.

The story: It was the worst loss of the Pete Carroll era and likely marked the end of USC’s run of Pac-10 titles, as the Trojans were dismantled by the resurgent Oregon Ducks 47-20, before a record and raucous Autzen Stadium crowd.
Led by redshirt freshman running back LaMichael James, who rushed a career-high 183 yards, No. 10 Oregon (7-1, 5-0 Pac-10) rushed for 391 yards and averaged 8 yards per carry, wearing down a USC defense that had shown cracks against Notre Dame and Oregon State.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“This was a real mess for us tonight,” Carroll said after the game. “Oregon did everything they wanted to do.”
Punting only once all night, the Ducks were nine for nine in the red zone and scored on five consecutive drives in the second half to blow the game open.
The 47 points surrendered were the most since a 1996 double-overtime loss to UCLA, and All-American senior safety Taylor Mays said he never saw it coming.
“No, never,” Mays said. “Not with the talent that we have, not with the coaches that we have, not with how hard we practice and the potential that we have as a team. And that’s why this loss hurt.”
The then-No. 5 Trojans (6-2, 3-2) hung tough for a half, largely on the strength of redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams’ seven catches for 70 yards and a touchdown. Williams, who was limited by a bruised gluteus muscle all week and appeared to struggle with the injury in the second half, finished with nine receptions and 82 yards.
Junior running back Joe McKnight chipped in with 95 yards on 15 carries, but USC managed just 327 yards and committed six false start penalties.
Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley went 21 of 38 for 187 yards, scored two touchdowns and was intercepted on the last play of the game.
Most valuable player: Oregon quarterback Jeremiah Masoli turned in a masterful performance, throwing for 222 yards and a touchdown and rushing for another 164 yards and a score.
“The runs he popped, whether they were scrambles or by design, just broke our back,” Carroll said.
Play of the game: After a 39-yard Jordan Congdon field goal cut the lead to 27-20, Oregon responded with a seven-play, 80-yard touchdown drive that began with Masoli’s 26-yard scramble through gaping holes in the USC defense. James capped the drive with a five-yard touchdown run and the rout was on.
By the numbers: The 27-point margin of defeat marked only the second time Carroll has lost by double digits at USC. In 2001, Notre Dame downed the Trojans 27-16.
Oregon rolled up 613 yards of total offense, the second-most ever allowed by USC. Only Notre Dame in 1946 topped that total.
USC came into the game leading the nation in sacks per game. They did not sack Masoli.
Finishing the job: In 2007, Oregon handed USC its second conference loss and was well on its way to winning the Pac-10 before quarterback Dennis Dixon injured his knee and the Ducks fell apart down the stretch.
In 2009, the Trojans will need similar circumstances to claim its eighth straight conference title. Oregon now has a two-game lead in the standings, and with the head-to-head tiebreaker, would need to lose three times for USC to claim the automatic Rose Bowl berth.
Sad you see us lose but certainly expected.  I posted after the Washington loss why USC will be on a seven year Las Vegas Bowl run.  Here are three reasons:
1)    The laid back, lack of focus, no intensity training of the USC football team.  When other conferences and teams make adjustments and beef up their training and practice, why should USC do the same?  The other teams have obviously adapted enough to beat USC’s conservative and redundant play calling.
2)    Why watch your opponents’ game footage and compare each team’s off the line speed???  If you compare side by side, the speed of each team, you will see the lightning speed of other teams versus the molasses quickness of USC’s runningbacks and overall team speed.  If USC keeps this up, you might as well send all the upcoming seniors to the senior citizen’s home – they move just as fast.
3)    False sense of superiority.
 Please do not read or listen to the media about USC’s dominance because it just isn’t there.  The hype is just that – all hype.  It is one thing to give your players encouragement, but to give them a false sense of encouragement leads to disappointment and a losing season. Be realistic.  Tell it like it is so they can work harder, faster and stronger. Without this, USC is looking at a 7 year Las Vegas Bowl run.
Did the coaching staff decide not to watch the Oreson Washington game the week prior?  Did they really believe after the loss to Washington that the team was in an any type of bowl contention?  Keep the training a few levels below the the top ten and we should see more games like the Oregon blowout.  Hats off to Chip Kelly, his coaching staff, and the players.  This season belongs to them.
Hmmm…I think it’s telling that the players were shocked and in disbelief. I don’t know why they would have been shocked — many of their fans have been very nervous about this team for some time. I know my friends and I were upset about the outcome but none of us was “shocked.” Not even close.
Obviously, our players thought they were playing better than they actually were, and I can’t imagine why. Maybe they were watching different game tape?
In that respect, maybe it was time for us to be humbled, as much as it hurts. Going into any game thinking “it can’t happen to us” is a recipe for disaster. Confidence and talent and potential are great, but they are no substitute for hard work and perspiration and a sense of urgency.
We had it coming, but we’ll get it together I’m sure.
Anyone who watched the very narrow escape at ND, or sat in the Coliseum to watch them escape against OSU had to see this coming. Not much to say really. Carroll has to actually do a lot of coaching just to keep them from another loss. The players will probably stop the dancing after routine plays and the high fiving, and acting as if they’re world beaters…..but then again, probably not.  Whatever Big 10 team awaits will get drilled by Oregon, as always happens. Some things never change at the Rose Bowl.

Autzen Stadium was as loud as it was cracked up to be, but the loss wasn’t about the noise.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The Trojans were flagged six times for false start, but it wasn’t about the penalties.
And USC had just as many takeaways as Oregon, but it wasn’t about the turnovers either.
For the first time since coach Pete Carroll arrived at USC, the Trojans lost a game not because of a last-minute field goal or extreme misfortune.
Instead, the Trojans were completely dismantled in a 47-20 rout, explained by words that haven’t been heard in Southern California since Carroll arrived in 2001.
“We knew what was coming. It wasn’t like they out-schemed us, it wasn’t like they were more athletic than us — we just got beat,” USC senior safety Taylor Mays said. “They beat us straight up playing football.”
The Ducks dispatched the Trojans by record-setting proportions, putting up 613 yards of total offense on a defense that was at one point thought to be among the nation’s best. It was the second-worst defensive performance in USC history, surpassed only in 1946 against Notre Dame.
Junior quarterback Jeremiah Masoli and redshirt freshman running back LaMichael James embarrassed the Trojans on the ground, helping the Ducks rack up 391 rushing yards. Not since 1977 when Texas A&M rushed for 486 yards has USC played so awfully against the run.
And the 47 points the Trojans gave up was the most since 1996, when UCLA scored 48 in double overtime.
“This was a real mess for us tonight. Oregon did everything they wanted to do,” Carroll said.
Masoli had a monster game, passing for 222 yards and one touchdown while rushing for 164 yards and another touchdown. The Trojans couldn’t seem to corral the Oregon quarterback, as he bounced off would-be tacklers and evaded sure sacks.
“The runs that he popped, whether they were scrambles or by design, just broke our back,” Carroll said.
James was just as impressive, putting up for 184 yards on 24 carries and one touchdown. The 5-foot-9, 180-pound tailback is built similarly to Oregon State’s Jacquizz Rodgers, and he was just as effective.
“We just lost track of him back in the backfield about four or five times,” Carroll said.
And what about the Trojan defense? Well, there were 11 guys in USC jerseys on the field, but I don’t think many people would consider that defense.
At the beginning of the season, the defense was USC’s foundation. Remember how it tamed quarterback Terrelle Pryor at Ohio State? Remember how it corralled Jahvid Best at Cal?
But after a second half letdown against Notre Dame, the whispers started. After giving up 36 points and 482 total yards to the Beavers, some eyebrows started to raise.
Then it all came crashing down. Oregon scored practically every time it touched the ball. USC forced the Ducks to punt just one time in the entire game.
To its credit, the offense hung in there in the first half, putting up 17 points and keeping the game within reach. But then it too started to sputter in the second half, probably because it was trying too hard to overcome an ever-growing Oregon lead.
It’s been a long time since a USC team looked so outmatched. It’s been a long time since USC got smacked and instead of fighting back, it just rolled over.
“They hit us in the mouth and they kept hitting us in the mouth,” Mays said.
The mood in the locker room after the game was, not surprisingly, one of disbelief. From the starting quarterback to the fourth string punter, nobody ever expects to lose like this.
“I never thought this could happen,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said.
What makes this particular loss so debilitating for USC is the shock that Barkley and other players expressed. In close losses, like the one at Washington earlier this year, a team can point to a few elements that changed the game, whether it be turnovers, blown coverages or dumb penalties.
After a blowout, there are no scapegoats — not a moment here or player there that could have changed the outcome. After being dismantled, you’re left only with shaken confidence and the knowledge that the team on the opposing sideline is better than you.
The challenge now is for the Trojans to prevent this loss from defining their season.
“We lost this game, but we don’t want to give up the rest of our season,” redshirt junior linebacker Michael Morgan said.
And they won’t. The Trojans will probably respond and come back to win the rest of their games.
But the sting of this sound beating will be with them for a long time.

The game was a setup, really. Playing in Autzen on Halloween? Who agreed to that? That place was a madhouse.
Of course, the Trojans sucked in Eugene.  But, better to lose one game by 27 points than 27 games by one point.  The boys should remember how it feels to be beaten (that’s incentive to work like Hell) but get over it.   Coaches and players need to move forward and win out.
Thank you Katie for you tough-love approach. It’s obvious you’re not a fairweather fan.

Since elementary school, our elders have tried to instill in us the value of punctuality. Although unpacking your backpack and starting your in-class assignment before the first bell rang was rarely rewarded, showing up late was all-too-frequently grounds for disciplinary measures: a proverbial slap on the wrist, a dreaded “tardy” marring your otherwise perfect attendance record or, God forbid, a detention.
But as we’ve gotten older, the emphasis on punctuality has gradually lessened. Walking into a lecture 15 minutes late with perfectly coiffed hair and a Starbucks caramel macchiato says you certainly weren’t doing everything in your power to show up on time.
The professor, assuming he notices at all, may pause for effect and give you the stink eye before continuing with his spiel. And the student walks away sans penalization — what, then, is the incentive to actually show up on time?
Although my 9-year-old sister works herself into a frenzy over the prospect of being late to school, my middle-aged co-workers hardly bat an eyelash at arriving at the law firm half-past 10 a.m.
One repeat tardy offender was a 40-something attorney and mother of three rambunctious boys under the age of 10. Naturally, one is obligated to cut her some slack for managing to balance a demanding law career with a hectic home life.
Even so, some mistakes are unforgivable — like her tendency to saunter into the office whenever she felt so inclined. Beyond just being late, she would often show up with her wet hair tied back in a Flashdance-era scrunchie, knee-length bike shorts, a sweat-wicking tank and hot-pink water shoes.
Operating under the assumption that she had just returned from a grueling pre-work workout (boogie boarding, perhaps?), she could have, at the very least, changed into her business attire before coming into the office.
She must have been aware of the lack of professionalism both her tardiness and attire suggested because she asked me to check the surrounding hallways for the presence of co-workers or clients. After assuring her that the coast was clear, she was able to come out of her office without worrying about the possibility of blinding passers-by with an ensemble that one fellow attorney described as being “morally offensive.”
Other times she would come in late, but slightly more prepared, with wet hair, no makeup and her standard business attire. She must have already been running late and didn’t want to waste the extra 15 minutes drying and styling her hair when she could just as easily primp at the office.
Although I was never guilty of such grave offenses, such as getting ready for work at work after the workday had already begun, I will admit to being several minutes late on a near-daily basis.
Every week I would promise myself I’d show up on time by leaving my house five minutes prior to my usual departure time. But every week, I’d show up later and later, and, before I knew it, two minutes turned into 10 or 12.
Sometimes I hit the snooze button one too many times and was forced to get ready in a hurry. Other times, I would take my sweet time perfecting my hair or changing outfits three (okay, six) times until I was halfway pleased with my appearance.
In those cases, I’d have to feign the panic that often accompanies showing up late. Several paces before entering the double glass doors that led to the lobby, I’d pick up the pace and start panting to induce some brow sweat, thus giving off the impression I had at least tried to make it to work on time.
All non-attorney employees were paid an hourly wage contingent on clocking in at the beginning of the workday and out at the end. In spite of my chronic tardiness, I was never reprimanded. Human Resources had a clear record of the very minute I stepped on and off the premises each day, and, still, they said nothing.
The punishment, though, was the shame of being late almost every day and having to walk past the offices and cubicles of my fellow employees.
Despite how strictly or loosely they are enforced, traditional offices have hours of operation. Excluding extenuating circumstances, the expectation is that all employees will show up on time and leave when the five o’clock whistle sounds.
Although you may not be fired for your unwillingness to get out of bed just a little earlier or forgo your early morning workout, your superiors will take notice. And when the next promotion opportunity arises, your punctuality demerits may actually, dare I say it, matter.
Not being on time indicates a lack of reliability and a generally indifferent attitude, which the management does not look upon favorably. And even if the higher-ups opt to turn the other cheek, your co-workers will begrudge you the extra sleep and extra shot mocha latte you got while they slaved away at their desks.
In the case of early bird vs. late to work, it is the judgment of this column that you should be sentenced to a life term as the office disgrace should you show up fashionably late rather than right on time.

“No matter what you do, make sure that you have a good time,” indie folk-rocker Devendra Banhart said last Thursday during a party celebrating the release of his seventh album, What Will We Be.
Discreetly located on the second floor of a Chinatown restaurant, the apartment previously known as Madame Wong’s is a former concert hot spot known to some as LA’s version of CBGB’s. Madame Wong’s became famous in the ’70s and ’80s for bringing in such acts as The Pretenders, The Ramones and Oingo Boingo to LA audiophiles.
Freak-folk · Devendra Banhart performed songs off his latest album, What Will We Be, last Thursday in Chinatown. A distinguished member of LA’s underground music community, Banhart’s audience consisted of mostly friends and family, including actress Kat Dennings and musician Fabrizio Moretti. - Scott Melendez | Daily Trojan
Thursday night, however, Banhart and his crew of sombrero-wearing psych-folk compadres decorated the recently converted two-story townhouse with skull-shaped piñatas, ice tubs full of free cerveza, dark-red lighting and endless trays of enchiladas and churros to give the celebration a timely Dia de los Muertos theme.
Different from most big-time indie-rock shows, the audience at Madame Wong’s was a small crowd of Banhart’s friends and family, including actress Kat Dennings, who stood in the front row, tapping her feet as marionette shadows danced across the walls, and Strokes drummer Fabrizio Moretti, who performed as a guest musician in Banhart’s band.
A visual artist, poet, singer-songwriter and occasional actor, Banhart’s personality is an exact reflection of his musical style — friendly and genuine, but mysteriously difficult to diagnose — making this exclusive live concert an ethereal experience. It’s one grounded in reality but high enough to scrape the dew off a Venezuelan rainbow.
Born in Los Angeles but raised in Venezuela until the age of 14, Banhart attended the San Francisco Art Institute, but his artistic journey entailed getting as far away from the rules as possible.
“In college, they’d tell me to paint pictures a certain way, make art a certain way and get rid of my own personal style, and that’s when I knew I had to get out,” he said in a quiet booth at Footsies, a hole-in-the-wall bar located a few miles north of Chinatown, where Banhart held his after-party.
After performing music on the streets and at small venues in the Castro district, Banhart decided to pursue his musical interests full-time and played concerts throughout the United States and Europe. His first six albums consisted of innovative musical combinations using rustic string instruments, raspy vocals and dreamy poetry. Success with these new sounds ultimately mounted Banhart as the poster child for New Weird America, a recently established musical subgenre also known as freak-folk or, as Banhart describes it, “naturalisimo.”
In the last few years, however, Banhart’s fame has spiked with art exhibitions, bit roles in studio films, musical contributions to TV commercials and a brief relationship with actress Natalie Portman — it’s no wonder he feels resistant to becoming a sellout. But although Banhart has a lot more exposure on the horizon — including songs on Todd Solondz’s upcoming Life During Wartime soundtrack and a featured spot on a Beck-compiled compilation of Leonard Cohen covers — he remains optimistic.
“College is very important,” Banhart said. “I left the institution, but I kept the connections I found there and have benefited from them to this day.”
Dennings agrees with this statement, as she swoops into the booth and whispers something into his ear every few minutes. A longtime friend of his, Dennings and Banhart shared the silver screen together in the film Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, and continue to stay in touch. Concerning Banhart’s new album, Dennings adds that it’s “like unicorns dipped in chocolate.”
Banhart, however, isn’t too quick to praise his new work.
“My new album isn’t completely honest,” Banhart admitted after Moretti poured him a shot of tequila. “Even though it focuses on updating different genres, it’s not totally me.”
Despite Banhart’s sentiments toward the album, the 14-track What Will We Be is already getting rave reviews and is sure to propel Banhart even further up the ladder of important folk artists of our generation. The album mixes elements of R&B, bluegrass and Latin musical styles, and has an effervescent, friendly mood to it — much like the atmosphere Banhart has created for his guests Thursday night.
As the after-party wound down and Banhart headed off to a much more exclusive after-after-party, he made sure to write down a list of his favorite films and TV shows, taking contributions from Dennings, Moretti and other friends — in hopes of inspiring college students to follow in his footsteps and relish in the “naturalisimo.”

If Pete Carroll is the face of USC, then surely President Steven B. Sample is the brains.
In 1991, the man who assumed the role of USC’s 10th president had his work cut out for him. In the last 18 years, Sample has transformed USC from a commuter school to a residential university. His tenure has seen USC rise 25 spots in the US News & World Reports rankings; with an increase in merit-based scholarships and a rigorous recruiting regimen, USC’s admittance rate has fallen from 70 percent in 1991 to 24 percent this year. His work emphasizing USC’s presence abroad has brought to campus the most international students of any national university.
As USC began the precarious process of reaching out into the community, Sample worked to ensure a cohesive expansion and focused on reconciling the interests of the surrounding area with the needs of a burgeoning urban university.
His emphasis on community service won USC Time Magazine’s “College of the Year” in 2000, and his vision for the Master Plan aims to further cement USC as one of the focal points in Los Angeles.
Today, Sample is officially announcing his decision to step down from his post in August. With his resignation, he leaves a formidable legacy to whoever accepts his mantle.
Sample has fostered almost two decades of comprehensive change at USC. As the university stands on the cusp of generation-defining change, his successor will have the tremendous task of continuing Sample’s momentum.
It is up to USC’s next president to promote and continue many of Sample’s achievements — making USC a destination school for students across the country and the world, continuing to develop the Figueroa Corridor in conjunction with the community, maintaining an open dialogue with community leaders, faculty and students.
The decisions made over the next few years are going to shape USC’s new identity as we move further into the 21st century. Let’s honor Sample’s progress by making sure that it never slows and never stops.

When I heard that President Steven B. Sample would be retiring at the end of the year, my first reaction was, “So what?”
In my time at USC, I have not met Sample; in fact, I doubt I would recognize him on the street. My reaction was so minimal because I really had no idea what it is that Sample does.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
I don’t think I am alone. Sample has not been a visible presence on the campus that he has lead for almost 19 years. At many universities, presidents make an effort to promote their own name by making plenty of speeches and public appearances, but Sample has not done that.
And so, most students are not aware of Sample’s efforts, or of the fact that without him they would likely not be here today.
But USC students should be more cognizant of his impact on their presence and experience here at USC.
During his tenure as USC president, Sample hasn’t been the university’s most visible figure — a certain football coach fills that role — but he has focused doggedly on his goal of turning USC from the “University of Second Choice” or “University of Spoiled Children” to a top-tier research university that attracts high-caliber students and professors from around the world.
It’s a goal of many presidents at middling universities, but Sample is perhaps the best success story of all.
When Sample took over in 1991, USC was ranked 51st in the US News & World Report rankings of US research universities. Today it is 26th. Sample achieved this by increasing merit scholarships and becoming a wildly successful fundraiser, encouraging a virtuous cycle wherein good students, professors and money attract more good students, professors and money.
Many of us consulted the US News rankings when deciding where to go to school; we would not have been so interested in USC if it was still No. 51.
Many of us would also not have been interested in USC in 1991 because of the surrounding neighborhood. But instead of caving to pressure to move the school to Orange County after the 1992 LA riots, Sample became determined to improve the North University Park area by investing money and encouraging students to volunteer.
Today, the USC area, although far from insulated, is safer, and students enjoy great opportunities to become engaged with their surroundings by volunteering. This year USC was named the top “good neighbor” college in a national survey of colleges and universities.
Sample has also led amazing improvements to the campus itself. His fundraising efforts have allowed for the construction of new buildings like the Annenberg School for Communication, the Galen Center and the upcoming campus center that make student life at USC more comfortable, interesting and fun.
And while Sample has stayed out of the spotlight, he has not shied away from putting USC in it. He has worked tirelessly to promote USC’s reputation, and realizes that improving a school is only most significant when matched with a strong effort to market those improvements. As a result, USC’s name continues to gain prestige nationwide and worldwide, and those “University of …” monikers are fading away.
Without Sample, many of us would be attending other universities right now — probably ones without the combination of student lifestyle and academic prestige offered by USC.
So thank you, President Sample, for being our university’s invisible guiding hand. We hope that whoever the next president will be, he or she will learn from your vision and skills to continue pushing USC on an upward path.

In the fourth quarter, LaMichael James burst through the Trojans’ defensive line for 10 yards and another first down. Only this time, he fumbled as he was tackled to the ground and USC redshirt senior safety Will Harris recovered the ball, returning it 66 yards for a touchdown.
At least, that’s what it looked like. After reviewing the play, officials overturned the fumble, ruling that James’ knee was down before he lost control of the ball.
Running wild · Oregon quarterback Jeremiah Masoli torched the Trojan defense on the ground, rushing for 164 yards and one touchdown. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
It was that kind of night for the No. 5 Trojans, who suffered their worst loss since a 27-0 shutout against Washington in 1997. James ran for 184 yards and one touchdown and junior quarterback Jeremiah Masoli piled on 386 yards of total offense as the Ducks rolled to a 47-20 triumph over USC (6-2, 3-2 Pac-10).
Oregon fans, clad in black and dark green, rushed the field after the final whistle sounded on the Trojans’ second loss at Autzen Stadium in three years. The Ducks (7-1, 5-0) had previously defeated USC 24-17 in 2007.
“We just got beat up upfront,” USC senior safety Taylor Mays said. “We didn’t tackle well, and they busted us. They hit us in the mouth, and they kept hitting us in the mouth.”
For the third straight year, the Trojans watched their national title hopes melt away in the Oregon rain. Last season, they fell to Oregon State, 11 months after their previous ill-fated visit to Eugene, Ore.
But neither of those games was decided by more than a touchdown. In fact, the Trojans had not lost by more than seven points since a 27-16 loss to Notre Dame in 2001.
This proved to be a much more lopsided defeat, as Oregon’s 47 points were the most allowed by any USC squad since UCLA scored 58 in 1996. The Ducks’ 613 yards on offense — 391 of those came on the ground — were second only to the 623 Notre Dame racked up against the Trojans in 1946.
“We’ve never been in something like that,” said USC coach Pete Carroll. “They did everything they wanted to do. It was really pretty easy for them.”
This latest loss puts the Trojans’ streaks of seven consecutive Pac-10 titles and seven straight BCS appearances in serious jeopardy. Meanwhile, the Ducks, undefeated in Pac-10 play, look primed to take their first conference crown since 2001.
Masoli, who passed for 222 yards and ran for another 164 on his way to two scores, put the Ducks up 10-3 on a 3-yard run late in the first quarter. Minutes later, USC freshman quarterback Matt Barkley threw a three-yard strike to USC junior wide receiver Ronald Johnson to tie the game.
Barkley, who completed 21 of 38 throws for 187 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, directed several efficient drives to keep it close in the first half. But the Trojans’ defense would never find a way to slow down the Ducks, who led 24-17 at halftime.
James was especially difficult to stop, running all over the field in a performance that may have reminded USC fans of Oregon State’s Jacquizz Rodgers. Another diminutive running back, Rodgers gave the Trojans fits in the Beavers’ upset win last year and also accounted for 169 yards of offense a week ago at the Coliseum.
“We had trouble tackling him,” Carroll said of James. “We had him stopped in the backfield three, four, five times, and he spun around, ducked around and got out and made some big plays.”
Over the next two quarters, USC struggled to get anything going while James and Masoli continued to carve up the Trojans’ defense.
With 5:50 left in the third quarter, James took the ball into the end zone from five yards out to increase the lead to 14. Fellow redshirt freshman defensive back Kenjon Barner scored on a 3-yard run to make it 41-20 at the end of the quarter.
On defense, the Ducks shut down the Trojan attack. After gaining 193 yards and finding the end zone twice in the first half, USC could only manage a single field goal over the final 30 minutes.
It was certainly a new experience for the Trojans, but mostly it was just downright bewildering.
“I can’t even believe it right now,” said junior running back Joe McKnight. “I didn’t lose like this in high school, and I haven’t lost like this [in college]. Just to have that feeling for the first time — I hate it.”
It’s a little odd to keep hearing our players say how “shocking” it is and how they’re in “disbelief” and all that. Come on, guys, this is not that shocking at all. When we don’t tackle, when we rack up penalties, and when we do these things against a really good Oregon team, what do we expect?
The Washington loss was shocking. This was not. USC has been playing okay football, not great football. Okay football in Autzen will lead to a loss. Very predictable.

Beatlemania is sweeping the nation once again.
No, John Lennon and George Harrison have not come back as musically-gifted zombies to reunite the band. Instead, nostalgic Beatles fans are graced with the next best thing: The Beatles: Rock Band.
Hello Goodbye · The Beatles: Rock Band is the latest installment from the Rock Band series. The game covers the entirety of The Beatles history, from the band’s early days in Britain to its extreme popularity in America and later psychedelic phase. Featured in the game are No. 1 singles like “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and lesser-known tracks like “And Your Bird Can Sing.” - Photo courtesy of Harmonix Music
The Rock Band series of video games have been an entertaining way for friends to get together and spend a night living out rock-star fantasies, and The Beatles: Rock Band is no different — in fact, it is an improvement.
As an easy-to-play multiplayer game, The Beatles: Rock Band rewards group unity and is more satisfying to play with others than alone. I have seen non-video game fans eagerly play for hours, and even die-hard anti-rock ‘n’ roll fans pick up the guitar or take a turn at the drums. The Beatles has insanely catchy tunes and near-infinite appeal, which the game reflects.
The game aims to capture the feel of The Beatles’ start and rise to fame, along with the band members’ evolution as musicians. It covers the entire history of The Beatles, from the band’s early years playing in British pubs to the Fab Four Ed Sullivan era, all the way to the psychedelic post-India phase. Songs range from the succinct pop hits like “I Want to Hold Your Hand” to the wonderfully trippy and insanely-fun-to-play-at-two-in-the-morning “I Am the Walrus.”
The game also features a handful of more obscure tracks that are unfamiliar to the casual Beatles listener.
The Beatles: Rock Band improves on the standard Rock Band game in many ways. The game’s overall aesthetic, complete with bright colors and psychedelic imagery, looks sleeker and more toned down than the grungy Rock Band design. Many of the songs have specialized background themes — “Octopus’s Garden” features underwater graphics and imagery to accentuate the song effectively.
Introductory videos for each era — provided by MK12, which vastly improves on its disappointingly minimalist work on the opening credits of Quantum of Solace — perfectly set the mood and transport the players into the 1960s.
The controls are simple and intuitive, especially for those who are testing out Rock Band for the first time. Additionally, the game’s display is easy to follow, even when four people are playing.
But the game is not without its faults. The story mode is rather short and can be beaten in less than three hours. For a band whose career spanned 10 years, it is odd that the developers could not get more out of the its vast repertoire.
Also, for a band with such a strong discography, the depth of songs in the game is disappointingly shallow. The game only comes with 45 songs, and, despite downloadable tracks that unfortunately cost extra money, the overall selection falls flat. Where is “Eleanor Rigby?” Or “Strawberry Fields?” How could they not include “Hey Jude?”  Although the developers do a good job of mixing the band’s hit songs with lesser-known tracks, some of these omissions just seem like glaring oversights considering the seemingly unlimited access to The Beatles’ music they were given.
Nonetheless, the game is extremely entertaining. Whether it is one person playing or a group of people having a party, The Beatles: Rock Band is infinitely replayable. For devout Beatlemaniacs or just casual fans, the game is the perfect way to spend an evening with friends and enjoy the music of a band that helped define and popularize rock ‘n’ roll.
I agree with the author’s assessment of the game, though perhaps Mr. Slayton should learn some more Beatles history. First of all, the title has the phrase “Comes Together” in it. That would have been a nice little pun had the phrase not been in quotes. The name of the Beatles song is “Come Together,” so the quoting of ‘Comes Together” is both pointless and inaccurate.
Also, why would any fan want to have “Eleanor Rigby” as one of the tracks on the game? Don’t get me wrong, it’s an awesome song, but none of the Beatles play an instrument in the song. Having it on the game would be just over two minutes of standing there and doing nothing for anyone not on vocals.

On paper, the USC women’s cross country team’s 9th place finish at the Pac-10 Championships on Friday did not reflect the effort the team has put into the season.
However, all nine USC runners had their best race of the season, and coach Tom Walsh said it’s hard to be upset.
“Really I can’t complain,” Walsh said. “I’m very proud of these girls.”
Walsh noted the discrepancy between USC’s number of scholarship runners and the rest of the stacked Pack-10 conference.
“When you have one scholarship runner on your roster and you’re competing against everyone who’s got five or six, it’s like taking a pocketknife into a gunfight,” Walsh said. “And we held our own.”
Defending Pac-10 champion Washington won the 6K race, which took place at Sky Links golf course in Long Beach on Friday. Oregon finished 2nd, followed by Arizona State, Stanford, California, Arizona, UCLA, Oregon State and host USC. Washington State finished last.
For the Women of Troy, junior Zsofia Erdelyi once again led the way, finishing 22nd overall. Junior Christine Cortez was 60th overall, followed by freshman Kathleen Moloney, who ran in her first ever conference championship.
Senior Katherine Ellis and junior Zara Lukens, who ran as teammates in high school, rounded out USC’s scoring runners, finishing 67th and 68th overall, respectively. For Walsh, Lukens and the freshman Moloney stood out.
“I was really impressed with Zara and Kathleen,” Walsh said. “Those two really came up huge and ran well for us. Both of them ran the best race of their life by a lot.”
Although most of the girls had career-high performances, Walsh noted that they still were not satisfied.
“They weren’t happy with the 9th place finish,” Walsh said. “However, they were happy with their effort. A lot of them came up to me afterward and told me they left it all out on the course. To me, that’s all you can ask.”
As for Erdelyi, USC’s most talented runner, Walsh said that she is hitting her stride just in time for NCAA West Regionals on Nov. 14.
“She’s falling off later and later in the race as the season goes on,” Walsh said of Erdelyi. “She competed really hard on Friday. She’s almost where she needs to be.”
Despite the results, the Women of Troy still had much to be proud of. As the host of the Pac-10 Championships, USC had a strong showing of support in Long Beach.
“We had close to 700 people show up at this meet,” Walsh said. “It was a really well-run meet. The other schools were really impressed with the course. There were very few complaints at all.”

Struggling in conference matches on the road has been a problem for the USC women’s volleyball team all season. This weekend was more of the same.
The No. 16 Women of Troy fell to 4-7 in conference play and severely hurt their chances for a Pac-10 championship as they dropped matches to No. 4 Stanford and No. 14 California in northern California.
Behind the stellar play of Hana Cutura, California (13-8, 6-5) defeated USC (15-8, 4-7) Saturday night 3-1 (25-19, 25-16, 24-26, 25-20) at Haas Pavilion. Cutura hit .356 on the evening and led her team with 22 kills. Teammate Mindi Wiley chipped in with 13 kills and hit .391.
The duo was too much for the Women of Troy to handle. After dropping the first two sets, USC rallied to match point in the third set with three straight points, but the Bears finished off USC in the fourth set.
Although the loss was the Women of Troy’s second in two nights, coach Mick Haley likes the improvements he saw in his team.
“We had a great chance to win the fourth game but just didn’t have enough in the tank,” Haley said. “I thought the team did quite well other than not finishing and not winning. It’s still discouraging to lose, but we’re not giving up.”
In the match, senior All-American outside hitter Jessica Gysin had a team-high 14 kills for the Women of Troy. Sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter had 12 kills and 11 digs, but had 13 hitting errors for a minus .022 in the match.
Zoe Garrett came off the bench and had seven kills while setter Kendall Bateman had 43 assists and seven digs.
USC opened play Friday night in Palo Alto against the Cardinal (15-5, 8-2) and dropped the match 3-1 (18-25, 25-18, 25-13, 25-23).
Stanford’s Janet Okogbaa led her team hitting .455 with 13 kills and seven blocks, while teammate Alix Klineman added a team-high 16 kills and Cassidy Litchman recorded 11 kills and 14 digs.
Stanford used a 13-to-7 advantage in blocks to aid its effort and served up seven aces.
Down 18-16 in the first set, USC closed out the win with a 9-3 run before Stanford hit .438 in the second set and used its blocking game to force 11 USC errors in the third set.
The Cardinal had match point at 24-20 in the fourth before USC rallied with three straight points.  But Klineman closed out the victory with her final kill of the evening for the Cardinal.
“After the first game, they kicked it up a notch,” Haley said. “We played quite well, but couldn’t finish … It was pretty exhausting.”
USC’s sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams had a career-high 15 kills. Gysin had 13 kills and 15 digs for the Women of Troy.  Jupiter had 17 kills, including 10 in the first set, and 11 digs in the loss.  Jupiter had 10 kills in the first set alone, but finished the match with 11 hitting errors and a .130 clip.
Although the Women of Troy came out of a road trip winless yet again, Haley said he likes his team’s attitude and knows it has the ability to turn its struggles around for the remaining seven matches.
“We’ve got two choices,” he said. “We either keep getting better and battling and get into the tournament and play the way we’re capable of, or we give up. So far, I haven’t seen any of the give up. As long as they keep working at it, we’ve got a chance.”
Interesting that Haley puts the onus on the players when his recruiting has been mediocre the last two years. The team has regressed from last year with the additional year of experience for the freshman / sophomores of 2008, One listed fab 50 recruit Katie Fuller who doesn’t play at all , and Alex Jupiter from the year prior who has not improved are the big recruiting classes the last two years no wonder program headed downwards. The situation with Taylor Carrico leaving in her senior year is another example of problems in the program outside of the talent level. Assistant coaches are dismal since Paula W. left to be a head coach. Losing top players who were socal girls to Stanford like Barbosa and Kleinman from the South Bay area tells it all.

This latest loss puts the Trojans’ streaks of seven consecutive Pac-10 titles and seven straight BCS appearances in serious jeopardy.  Meanwhile, the Ducks, undefeated in Pac-10 play, look primed to take their first conference crown since 2001.
Masoli, who passed for 222 yards and ran for another 164 on his way to two scores, put the Ducks up 10-3 on a 3-yard run late in the first quarter. Minutes later, USC quarterback Barkley threw a 3-yard strike to Ronald Johnson to tie the game.
Barkley, who completed 21 of 38 throws for 187 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, directed several efficient drives to keep it close in the first half. But the Trojans’ defense would never find a way to slow down the Ducks, who led 24-17 at halftime.
James was especially difficult to stop, running all over the field in a performance that may have reminded USC fans of Oregon State’s Jacquizz Rodgers. Another diminutive running back, Rodgers gave the Trojans fits in the Beavers’ upset win last year and also accounted for 169 yards of offense a week ago at the Coliseum.
“We had trouble tackling him,” Carroll said of James. “We had him stopped in the backfield three, four, five times, and he spun around, ducked around, and got out and made some big plays.”
Over the next two quarters, USC struggled to get anything going while James and Masoli continued to carve up the Trojans’ defense.
With 5:50 left in the third quarter, James took the ball into the end zone from 5 yards out to increase the lead to 14. Fellow redshirt freshman Kenjon Barner scored on a 3-yard run to make it 41-20 at the end of the quarter.
On defense, the Ducks shut down the Trojan attack. After gaining 193 yards and finding the end zone twice in the first half, USC could only manage a single field goal over the final 30 minutes.
It was certainly a new experience for the Trojans, but mostly, it was just downright bewildering.
“I can’t even believe it right now,” said running back Joe McKnight. “I didn’t lose like this in high school, and I haven’t lost like this [in college]. Just to have that feeling for the first time, I hate it.”
Tomas, I agree with DK. He pointed out that the defense was so horrendous, maybe nothing could have helped Saturday. You’re right the defense has been suspect for a couple of games now, but the offense has not looked all that hot either if you ask me. And we were pathetic on BOTH sides of the ball in the second half of the Oregon game. It was a complete team collapse.
DK’s larger point is also correct. Whatever’s going on, the fact remains that Carroll does not have a championship without Norm Chow. Having a great offense does open up the field and take the pressure off your defense. USC’s offenses since Chow left have been very good. But they have not been great. USC fielded some very good teams in the Kiffin-Sarkisian years. But we have not had a team recently that could beat one of the Carroll-Chow teams. That’s just truth.
Maybe it is time to eat some humble pie, bite the bullet, and ask Chow to come back. I don’t know if that could save us if the defense keeps up the mediocrity, but it can’t hurt either.
DK, Mark was the QB and Norm Chow didn’t coach the defense…TheTOTAL COLLAPSE of the defense ever since the last quarter of the Notre Dame game has been bewildering. It’s time to hold someone accountable.
Agreed, the loss of Sanchez has been huge, now we know why Pete was so upset about it. It’s unfortunate he skipped out (especially after the SC athletic department saved him from those sexual assault charges nobody is ever allowed to talk about anymore). But given the defense’s unfortunate performance on Saturday, I’m not sure even Sanchez could have saved us.
I do think, however, our offense sorely misses Norm Chow. The bottom line is that USC has not sniffed a national championship since Chow left…or was pushed out by the ambitious duo — Kiffin and Sarkisian. Now what’s the result? USC is no longer dominant, Chow is gone, and so are the ruthless social climbers Kiffin and Sarkisian. We lost both the bathwater and the baby.
Chow needs to come home. UCLA does not have talent worthy of his skills. USC does. Pete and the boosters need to do whatever it takes to get Norm Chow back at Heritage Hall.
This is a wake up call. We have taken our team for granted, and this was memorial to the Hackett years. During a game, we even acted like we did during that time. The booing of a fellow Trojan. (Remember Carson Palmer). We had the opportunity to have our first Hispanic Heisman, the inclination to the NFL was very strong. We have the talent, we have the ability, but I dare not say it.  As for those UW coaches, I cant help but feel like we were stepped on to move on. Pete Carrol has taken is this far and has recruited the talent. I know he will do what is best.

Autzen Stadium was as loud as it was cracked up to be, but it wasn’t about the noise.
The Trojans were flagged six times for false start, but it wasn’t about the penalties.
Daily Trojan | Dieuwertje Kast
And USC had just as many takeaways as Oregon, but it wasn’t about the turnovers either.
For the first time since Pete Carroll arrived ay USC, the Trojans lost a game not because of a last-minute field goal or extreme misfortune. Instead, the Trojans were completely dismantled in a 47-20 rout, explained by words that haven’t been heard in Sothern California in a very long time.
“We knew what was coming. It wasn’t like they out-schemed us, it wasn’t like they were more athletic than us — we just got beat,” USC safety Taylor Mays said. “They beat us straight up playing football.”
The Ducks ripped the Trojans to historic proportions, putting up 613 yards of total offense on a defense that was at one point thought to be among the nation’s best. It was the second worst defensive performance in USC history, surpassed only in 1946 against Notre Dame.
Quarterback Jeremiah Masoli and running back LaMichael James embarrassed the Trojans on the ground, helping the Ducks rack up 398 rushing yards. Not since 1977 when Texas A&M rushed for 486 yards had USC played so awfully against the run.
And the 47 points the Trojans gave up was the most since 1996, when UCLA scored 48 in double overtime.
“This was a real mess for us tonight. Oregon did everything they wanted to do,” Carroll said.
Masoli had a monster game, passing for 222 yards and one touchdown while rushing for 165 yards and another touchdown. The Trojans couldn’t seem to corral the Oregon quarterback, as he bounced off would-be tacklers and evaded sure sacks.
“The runs that he popped, whether they were scrambles or by design, just broke our back,” Carroll said.
James was just as impressive, putting up for 184 yards on 22 carries and one touchdown. The 5-foot-9, 190-pound tailback is built similar to Oregon State’s Jacquizz Rodgers and was just as effective.
“We just lost track of him back in the backfield about four or five times,” Carroll said.
And what about the Trojan defense? I mean, there were 11 guys in USC jerseys on the field, but I don’t think many people would consider that defense.
At the beginning of the season, the defense was USC’s foundation. Remember how it tamed Terrelle Pryor at Ohio State? Remember how it corralled Jahvid Best at Cal?
But after a second half letdown against Notre Dame, the whispers started. After giving up 36 points and 482 total yards to the Beavers, some eyebrows started to raise.
Then it all came crashing down. Oregon scored practically every time it touched the ball. USC forced the Ducks to punt just one time in the entire game.
To its credit, the offense hung in there in the first half, putting up 17 points and keeping the game within reach. But then it too started to sputter in the second half, probably because it was trying too hard to overcome an ever-growing Oregon lead.
It’s been a long time since a USC team looked so outmatched. It’s been a long time since USC got smacked and instead of fighting back, just rolled over.
“They hit us in the mouth and they kept hitting us in the mouth,” Mays said.
The mood in the locker room after the game was not surprisingly one of disbelief. From the starting quarterback to the fourth string punter, nobody ever expects to lose like this.
“I never thought this could happen,” quarterback Matt Barkley said.
What makes this particular loss so debilitating for USC is the shock that Barkley and other players expressed. In close losses, like the one at Washington earlier this year, a team can point to a few plays that changed the game, whether it be turnovers, blown coverages or dumb penalties.
After a blowout, there are no scapegoats — not a moment here or player there that could have changed the outcome. After being dismantled, you’re left only with shaken confidence and the knowledge that the team on the opposing sideline is better than you.
The challenge now is for the Trojans to prevent this loss from defining their season.
“We lost this game, but we don’t want to give up the rest of our season,” linebacker Michael Morgan said.
And they won’t. The Trojans will probably respond and win the rest of their games.
But the sting of this sound beating will be with them for a long time.

The story: It was the worst loss of the Pete Carroll era and likely marked the end of USC’s run of Pac-10 titles, as the Trojans were dismantled by the resurgent Oregon Ducks, 47-20, before a record and raucous Autzen Stadium crowd.
Led by redshirt freshman running back LaMichael James’ career-high 183 yards, No. 10 Oregon (7-1, 5-0 Pac-10) rushed for 391 yards and averaged 8 yards per carry, wearing down a USC defense that had shown cracks against Notre Dame and Oregon State.
Daily Trojan | Dieuwertje Kast
“This was a real mess for us tonight,” Carroll said. “Oregon did everything they wanted to do.”
Punting only once all night, the Ducks were 9 for 9 in the red zone and scored on five consecutive drives in the second half to blow the game open.
The 47 points surrendered were the most since a 1996 double-overtime loss to UCLA, and All-American safety Taylor Mays said he never saw it coming.
“No, never,” Mays said. “Not with the talent that we have, not with the coaches that we have, not with how hard we practice and the potential that we have as a team. And that’s why this loss hurt.”
The No. 5 Trojans (6-2, 3-2) hung tough for a half, largely on the strength of receiver Damian Williams’ seven catches for 70 yards and a touchdown. Williams, who was limited by a bruised glut all week and appeared to struggle with the injury in the second half, finished with nine receptions and 82 yards.
Joe McKnight chipped in with 95 yards on 15 carries, but USC managed just 327 yards and committed six false start penalties.
Matt Barkley was 21 of 38 for 187 yards, two touchdowns and was intercepted on the last play of the game.
Most valuable player: Oregon quarterback Jeremiah Masoli turned in a masterful performance, throwing for 222 yards and a touchdown and rushing for another 165 yards and a score.
“The runs he popped, whether they were scrambles or by design, just broke our back,” Carroll said.
Play of the game: After a 39-yard Jordan Congdon field goal cut the lead to 27-20, Oregon responded with a 7-play, 80-yard touchdown drive that began with Masoli’s 26-yard scramble through gaping holes in the USC defense. James capped the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run and the rout was on.
By the numbers: The 27-point margin of defeat marked only the second time Carroll has lost by double digits at USC. In 2001, Notre Dame downed the Trojans 27-16.
Oregon rolled up 613 yards of total offense, the second-most ever allowed by USC. Only Notre Dame in 1946 topped that total.
USC came into the game leading the nation in sacks per game. They did not sack Masoli.
Finishing the job: In 2007, Oregon handed USC its second conference loss and was well on its way to winning the Pac-10 before quarterback Dennis Dixon injured his knee and the Ducks fell apart down the stretch.
In 2009, the Trojans will need similar circumstances to claim its eighth-straight conference title. Oregon now has a two-game lead in the standings, and with the head-to-head tiebreaker, would need to lose three times for USC to claim the automatic Rose Bowl berth.
