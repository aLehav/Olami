During the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday, senators discussed work-study alternatives for undocumented students and sustainability projects.
USG president Alexis Areias covered the progress of several different projects in her presentation, including a push to provide free menstrual care products on campus and installing speed bumps on West 28th St.
Areias’ presentation included a progress update on the project to provide work-study alternatives to undocumented students. 
The project, which is a collaboration with the affordability and basic needs committee and Sydney Brown, chair of the external affairs committee, aims to address the disparity in undocumented students’ financial aid options as they can’t receive federal funding for work-study programs, Areias said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Areias next detailed the current status of USG’s sustainability initiative, which seeks to ban single-use plastics and expand the current number of trash cans on campus. 
The specifics of the ban are not finalized, as some single-use plastics such as straws could be an accessibility concern, Areias said.
“This would essentially be things like water bottles that you throw away, tupperware, things of that sort,” Areias said. “It’s a big goal and it’ll likely take time, but that’s definitely one of our big priorities for this year.”
Areias also hopes to move forward with a project to install speed bumps on West 28th St., citing the increase in traffic collisions involving scooters and pedestrians. 
“I actually have had three friends who have been hit by scooters on 28th Street and beyond,” Areias said. “It’s a really huge problem. We see cars flying down for some reason, particularly on that stretch.”
Senator Nivea Krishnan next presented an itemized list of several of her projects, including an initiative to provide resources for students looking for housing in the central Los Angeles area. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Krishnan said the goal of the project is for students to have support from the University when looking for affordable housing options, primarily through connections with local businesses. 
“There is a lot of existing information on them,” Krishnan said. “We’re trying to figure out what current information is out there and what current efforts there are so that we can work to promote these efforts and if they need more support in any capacity.”
Krishnan hopes the project supplements the existing resources on campus so that students are aware of what opportunities are available for viable housing. 
At the end of the meeting, Anthony Khoory, a junior majoring in sociology, gave an update on the Middle Eastern and North African Center, which will apply for cultural assembly status in Spring 2022. The center is currently connecting with students through on-campus events, including an upcoming hafl (Arabic for party) in November sponsored through the Arabic Club. 
“We have a lot of smaller … organizations, so there’s Lebanese Club, there’s Saudi Student Association, there’s Persian Student Organization,” Khoory said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We don’t even know all of them because we’re not connected. We don’t have an overall assembly to connect [us].” 
Khoory said the benefits of becoming a student assembly through USG include not only connections among smaller Recognized Student Organizations but also access to USG’s resources, money and policies and “keeping this [community] alive for generations to come.” 
“It’s like any other racial, ethnic identity group, so it doesn’t make sense why there shouldn’t be one for us too,” Khoory said. “We don’t want to be invisible.”

When the crisis in Afghanistan began as a result of the United States’ military withdrawal that was announced in April and ended Aug. 30, Sara Yim knew she wanted to help her Afghan friends and their families get to safety outside of the country. As a result, Yim created a women-led, non-profit called Transit Initiatives that assists at-risk and vulnerable Afghan citizens with immediate evacuation from the country and movement to safer locations.
Yim previously worked in the United States Agency for International Development in the Office of Transition Initiatives before joining the social entrepreneurship master’s program at the Marshall School of Business. Yim said she hoped for a career pivot when she came to USC; however, when her former employees and friends reached out to her for help getting to safety, Yim offered assistance. 
Many rescue organizations including Yim’s took a digital humanitarian approach when responding to the crisis in August.
“I’ve never seen anything like this, by the way, it’s a whole different amazing beautiful story about how all of us are responding like this with such a digital response,” Yim said.
Yim initially volunteered her time to get her friends and their families on planes out of Kabul or overland to Pakistan. For Yim, getting Afghans through the gates of the Hamid Karzai International Airport was one of the most horrendous experiences of her life as many friends and former colleagues made appeals to add their Afghan families on the charter manifest out of Kabul. 
The ISIS-K bombings placed a dent on any hopes for departure by plane, even after the group navigated clearances from the U. S. Embassy in Kabul. As a result, Yim and her former colleagues pivoted to getting people out of Afghanistan through Mazar-i-Sharif and currently support the evacuations of 300 people through Mazar-i-Sharif. 
Starting out as a group of women who wanted to help their friends, Transit Initiatives slowly became an organization that assists evacuating Afghans with the goal to help them settle. 
“We recognize that we [are] in a space with a lot of veteran organizations who equally and emotionally felt the pain, and the call of duty to help support their allies,” Yim said. “Not only are we probably the only women-led organization in this space, but we are pretty focused on making sure civilian partners of the U.S. government and those at risk, in addition to those [military] partners, are also not forgotten in this conversation.”
Yim said she and her colleagues felt a duty to continue advocating for the safety and resettlement of Afghan military and civilian partners. She said that the Afghan people who risked their lives for democracy, human rights and to aid the U.S. government should not be left behind. Currently, Transit Initiatives includes six core members and a large network of volunteers primarily made up of former and current government officials, civilian and military partners and USC students. 
Over the summer, Yim worked as a Viterbi School of Engineering fellow for a digital health startup called Frontida Records, co-founded by alumna Laura Roed. Frontida Records was created after its team volunteered at Camp Moria in Greece — Europe’s largest refugee camp before it was burned down in Sept. 2020. After her fellowship, Yim stayed in touch with Frontida Records, and its members helped her create a database for Transit Initiatives and volunteered with Transit Initiatives, including Roed. 
“I wanted to help with the situation of people having to evacuate Afghanistan and the crisis there was pretty horrific to sit by and watch. So I knew Frontida, which is the name of my organization, could help their group and if it meant helping people get out safely then I figured it was worthwhile.” said Roed, a 2021 graduate. 
According to Roed, besides serving as a digital health platform, Frontida Records also builds custom apps using a no-code platform. The workflow not only builds apps for healthcare settings but also for any humanitarian crisis organization. 
With help from the Frontida Records team, the Transit Initiatives app manages to track Afghan contact information, immigration status and on their situation update, such as a person’s movement through different cities in Afghanistan and coordinating transportation for their escape. 
Another USC affiliated organization that works with Transit Initiatives is the Los Angeles Blockchain Lab, a partner with the Viterbi School of Engineering. Heidi Pease, the CEO and co-founder of the organization, was introduced to Transit Initiatives through a team member at Her Code, an initiative within the Lab that helps women and underserved youth get access to blockchain, a system of recording information in a system that is difficult to change, hack, or cheat and is used in cryptocurrency. 
Her Code worked with two STEM schools for young women in Afghanistan to provide greater accessibility to blockchain training to the students. However, when the U.S. military left Afghanistan, the teachers reached out to Her Code and said they were nervous because of the high risk nature at all-girls schools, which were targeted by the Taliban. The Her Code team agreed to help the teachers get to safety and collaborated with the Transit Initiatives team. 
“When I first got involved, me and the Her Code team, we thought we would just be filling out excel spreadsheets or filling out applications and sending passport information along to the State Department or whatever relevant agency,” said Pease, a fundraising volunteer for Transit Initiatives. “…it quickly escalated into they cannot stay in their house, they need to find a safe house, or how do we get them to safety?” 
Pease said that current initiatives in Afghanistan depended on local NGOs, nonprofits and volunteers. She said these different entities needed to work together and collaborate to be able to help the Afghanistan people.
For Yim, although Transit Initiatives currently holds volunteer fundraisers, it does not have the fundraising capacity and is one of the organization’s biggest challenges. Since her organization is new at fundraising, Yim said she is looking for support through professional fundraisers and grant writers as well as connections to foundations and charitable organizations. 
Although many are interested in donating, the organization faces issues with donors who are apprehensive about the credibility of in-country funds. However, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury, in-country support, like Transit Initiatives, is covered by the U.S. government’s waiver on Taliban government sanctions. If donors choose to support in-country organizations, they should support organizations run by “humanitarian professionals” who have experience working in conflict locations, Yim said.
When reflecting on her time as a U.S. government official, Yim believes her experience at Transit Initiatives is some of the most important work she has been a part of. 
“It is the most compelling work that I think I’ve done in my 15 years of progressive work in the humanitarian development space, and I’ve worked in various conflicts,” Yim said. “It is the most challenging, most emotional [experience] and it is something that I feel to my bone that I needed to play a role [in].”

USC is experiencing a “small uptick” of positive coronavirus cases among students this week, but the data is too preliminary to connect it as an emerging trend from the fall recess, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Tuesday. 
From Oct. 10 through Oct. 16, 25 new student cases of the coronavirus appeared on campus, according to Van Orman. While the number of confirmed cases continued its eight-week decline, Van Orman attributed student travel during the fall recess as a possibility for the slight increase. 
“We only have two days worth of data, [the positivity rate] is up above 0.1% this week, but we see some variation, so I wouldn’t want to say it’s definitely a trend yet — but we are seeing more cases today and yesterday than we have in previous weeks,” Van Orman said.
With colder weather and the approaching holiday season, Van Orman expects more students to congregate indoors. She highlighted the extent of the risks associated with indoor settings at parties in housing or nightclubs and said students should shift events outdoors when possible.
Van Orman said Halloween poses an increased risk of a rising case because many congregate indoors and neglect social distancing practices. She recommended mask wearing as a tool to “manage” potential spread.  
“[It’s] really important for people that, if you’re gathering in larger groups, the degree to which you could do it outdoors is better … [The coronavirus] is an aerosolized virus, so if you think of the environment of being at a party or indoor gathering where people are talking really loudly or standing close together, it is the perfect environment for coronavirus to spread,” Van Orman said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  California — with a positivity rate that has declined to 1.9% — is the only state that improved to a “moderate” level of transmission. Van Orman said she would like to see no hospitalizations and deaths stemming from the coronavirus in the Los Angeles community.
“California has some of the strictest public health rules, but some of the lowest case [levels], and I think those two things are completely related,” Van Orman said. “Our goal would be to not have cases and actually not have any transmission within our community.” 
Van Orman said Student Health is working with the Los Angeles County Public Health Department to smoothly navigate upcoming travel and holiday periods without experiencing a “winter surge.” 
Student Health said in a briefing on Oct. 13, 95% of all students, faculty and staff have completed their vaccine series. In addition, 2% of students have received a personal or medical exemption and the remaining three percent are in between doses. 
L.A. County and statewide policy makers are ramping up efforts to implement vaccine requirements to avoid another coronavirus surge. 
On Oct. 1, Governor Gavin Newsom announced the nation’s first coronavirus mandate for all K-12 schoolchildren. According to the Los Angeles Times, some families chose to keep their children home from school in conjunction with a statewide protest against the governor’s mandate Monday. The California Department of Public Health currently requires 10 different vaccines for students who wish to attend public schools, and will add the coronavirus vaccine once it receives full approval from the Federal Drug Administration.
On Oct. 6, Mayor Eric Garcetti signed an ordinance into law that will require residents in L.A. County to present proof of vaccination before entering most indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, shopping centers, entertainment venues and personal care establishments.
“It would be wonderful if we could get our community vaccination rates up, where we actually won’t have another surge,’’ Van Orman said. “From a county perspective, that’s what they’re trying to aim for, is to not have a winter surge, and that is also what we’re aiming [for] USC to not have a winter surge.” 
Van Orman said the “data is really clear” between the relationship of coronavirus transmission among universities with and without vaccine mandates. Vaccine mandates are proven to “control infection” and Student Health isn’t seeing any evidence of outbreaks connected to breakthrough infections. 
“At universities that do not have vaccine mandates, with 60-70% [of those vaccinated], we’re seeing cases, outbreaks and spread, so vaccine mandates and being a fully vaccinated university does exactly what we want it to do: protects people, protects our community and lets us get back to normal,” Van Orman said.

Growing up during the 2000s and early 2010s, I found that playing the NCAA basketball and football video games took up large portions of my day. Specifically, the main games I played from the respective series were NCAA Basketball 10 and NCAA Football 09. 
Even though I didn’t really know about college sports aside from my home state schools such as Kansas and Kansas State along with the major Blue Bloods like Duke, UNC and Michigan State, it was taking a team through March Madness or a BCS Bowl Game (back when that system still existed) that brought me joy. 
However, all of that excitement that came with playing as college teams began to fall apart at the start of the 2010s because of a class-action lawsuit from a former UCLA basketball player, Ed O’Bannon. O’Bannon was a member of the Bruins basketball team back in the ‘90s. He was included as a player in the EA Sports’ NCAA Basketball games in UCLA’s classic team. 
To avoid having to compensate players by using their names, NCAA and EA Sports circumvented this issue by not attaching names to the player but, rather, calling them something generic like “PG No. 1” and then matched up their appearance, skillset and other attributes resembling the actual player.
O’Bannon ended up arguing against the NCAA was that keeping appearances and other traits the same, even without the players’ names, is still illegal and players should be paid for taking part in the game. 
After much deliberation, O’Bannon eventually won the case with a $40 million settlement for the players, which is not that much as it was spread among at least 30 former athletes with checks ranging from $100 to a few thousand dollars. On top of that, the biggest loss was that the EA NCAA college sports video game franchises came to an end with NCAA Basketball 10 and NCAA Football 14, commonly known as one the best sports games ever.
Therefore, in the last 7 to 8 years, college sports video game fans such as myself have been in a drought of having the full-fledged experience. If you play the Madden or NBA 2K games, some college teams are available to use if you decide to create a player in each games’ career mode. 
The main reason why this option is even available is that these games used individual school licenses, so they can bring a few teams in to give more authenticity to the “road to glory” experience. Even USC is playable in the Madden franchise. 
What is exciting now is that EA announced the return of college football video games earlier this year. Something interesting to note is that it is now called “EA Sports College Football” and not the former “NCAA Football,” so there are definitely some changes with how that relationship will work compared to the past. 
At first, when EA announced it was bringing the series back, it was not planning to doanything related to player likeness because the Name, Image and Likeness deal did not pass at the time in February. However, after the NIL developments this summer, EA said it is interested in possibly bringing a more authentic experience to its college football game.
More than 100 schools have already said they are planning to be in EA’s new game. However, there is still some trouble getting powerhouses such as Notre Dame, who won’t join unless student-athletes are compensated and properly represented in the game. So, to get some of these remaining schools to join, EA might be forced to pay players for their NIL. 
The game is set to release in the summer of 2023, after I graduate from USC. But, now I will have a school to play for. 
Hopefully, if the “EA Sports College Football” series works well, this can also bring back the game for other collegiate sports like basketball. But only time will tell.

As the 75th NBA anniversary season of the NBA is set to begin, there are a few former USC stars to look out for. 
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls:
DeMar DeRozan played his one and only season at USC from2008-2009. As a freshman, he appeared in all 35 games for the Trojans and averaged 13.9 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. DeRozan went on to win the 2009 Pac-10 Tournament MVP, make the Pac-10 All-Freshman team and had his jersey retired in 2020. 
After one season with the Trojans, DeRozan declared for the 2009 NBA Draft and was selected with the 9th overall pick by the Toronto Raptors. As a Raptor, DeRozan was a four time NBA All-Star and was selected to two All-NBA teams. 
After nine seasons with Toronto in which DeRozan helped lead the team to the playoffs five times, he was traded to the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs made the playoffs in DeRozan’s first of three seasons with the team. In his three seasons with the Spurs, DeRozan averaged 21.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game.
Last offseason, the Chicago Bulls acquired the All-Star guard from San Antonio in a sign-and-trade deal. DeRozan will be joined by former USC center and teammate Nikola Vucevic. He joins a backcourt featuring two former UCLA players Lonzo Ball and Zach Lavine, in a foursome of crosstown rivals. The Bulls will strive to make a playoff push in the Eastern Conference with high hopes of making its first postseason appearance since 2017.
Center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls:
Before Vucevic became one of the most consistent centers in the NBA, he played three seasons for the Trojans from 2008 to 2011. The seven-footer averaged 11.1 points and 8 rebounds per game in his time at USC. Vucevic was a Second-Team All-Pac-10 selection in 2010 and a First-Team All-Pac-10 selection in 2011.
Following his third season with USC, Vucevic was drafted in the 2011 NBA Draft with the 16th overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers. After one season in Philadelphia, Vucevic was traded to the Orlando Magic. Vucevic played eight full seasons with the Magic before being traded in the middle of last season to the Chicago Bulls. In Orlando, Vucevic made two NBA All-Star appearances.Career-wise, the center averages 16.9 points, 10.4 rebounds per game and 2.7 assists per game.
Vucevic appeared in 26 games with the Bulls last year and averaged 21.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game, making his second All-Star game appearance.
Power Forward/Center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers:
The Trojans made their first Elite Eight appearance since 2001 in last year’s NCAA Tournament, and center Evan Mobley contributed to the team’s success along the way. Standing at 7-feet and 215 pounds, Mobley had a breakout year in his one and only season at USC. He played in 33 games and averaged 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.8 blocks per game.
Mobley was the Pac-12 Player of the Year, made First-teamAll-Pac-12, Pac-12 All Defensive and All-Freshman teams, received Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year honors, and was the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year. He’s the second player in college basketball history to also sweep a conference’s Player of the Year, Freshman of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year since Anthony Davis in 2012.
After his superb first season with the Trojans, Mobley declared for the 2021 NBA Draft and was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the 3rd overall pick behind prospects Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green. 
Mobley joins a Cavaliers frontcourt stacked with veterans such as Kevin Love, Lauri Markkanen and Jarrett Allen. He will need to earn his minutes as a rookie and make an immediate impact on a rebuilding Cavs team. 
Guard Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets:
In Kevin Porter Jr.’s lone season with USC, he appeared in 21 games and averaged 9.5 points, 4 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. Following his first year with the Trojans, he was drafted with the 30th overall pick in 2019 NBA Draft by the Milwaukee Bucks before being traded to the Cavaliers on draft night. In his short stint with Cleveland, he appeared in 50 games and averaged 10 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.
Porter Jr. was traded to the Houston Rockets the following season and briefly played with Houston’s G-League affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. 
Porter Jr. showcased his potential as he made the 2021 All-NBA G-League First Team. Porter Jr. appeared in 26 games for the Rockets last season, averaging 16.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game. 
The highlight game for the former Trojan, however, was against the Bucks as he finished with a statline of 50 points, 5 rebounds and 11 assists along with 9 three pointers made. At 20 years old, Porter Jr. became the youngest player to record a game with at least 50 points and 10 assists.
However, the Rockets drafted guard Jalen Green with their second overall pick in the 2021 Draft. Green, another scoring guard, and Porter Jr. will need to find a balance between himself and Green on the court.
Power Forward Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks:
In one season at USC, Okongwu averaged 16.2 points, 8.6 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 2.7 blocks per game. He was also named to theAll-Pac-12 first team and the Pac-12 All-Freshman team. 
Drafted 6th overall by the Atlanta Hawks in 2020, Okongwu played in 50 games last season and averaged 4.6 points and 3.3 rebounds per game. He played a key role in the Hawks’ playoff run last season. Okongwu will be out until December as he recovers from offseason shoulder surgery.
Power Forward/Center Taj Gibson, New York Knicks:
Taj Gibson played three solid seasons for the Trojans from2006-2009. He averaged close to a double-double with 12.4 points and 8.5 rebounds along with 2.4 blocks on the defensive end. Gibson’s consistent production earned him a Third-team All-Pac-10 selection in 2008, a Second-team All-Pac-10 selection in 2009 and the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the year award in the same season.
Following his third season at USC, Gibson declared for the 2009 NBA Draft and was selected with the 26th overall pick by the Bulls. Gibson was a selection for the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2010 and played seven full seasons with the Bulls before being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February 2017. After only appearing in 23 games for the Thunder, Gibson entered free agency and signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2017 offseason. After two seasons in Minnesota that included a playoff appearance, Gibson signed with the New York Knicks and he now enters his third season with the team.
Gibson has 12 years of NBA experience and played in 71 playoff games, most recently as a part of the Knicks who made their first postseason appearance since 2013 last season. Gibson will look to contribute to a Knicks team that had a busy offseason with the acquisitions of All-Star guard Kemba Walker and veteran guard Evan Fournier.

“Ojing-eo Geim” also known by its English translation “Squid Game” is the world’s newest Netflix binge obsession. The Korean thriller hit number one in dozens of countries globally, including the United States, and made history as Netflix’s most-watched series release. For USC students, there’s a closer connection — Hwang Dong-hyuk, creator of the series and USC alumnus, walked the same Trousdale Parkway as the rest of us. 
Even before “Squid Game” took over our lives, non-English language shows have grown in popularity in the U.S. Once you’re done binge-watching “Squid Game” and impatiently waiting for season two (yes, it’s been renewed), take a scroll through Netflix for your next post-midterm binge, don’t skip over the non-English language shows. Give it a shot. Who knows? It might be your new favorite. (P.S. Trust me and watch these shows with subtitles instead of dubbed, it makes all the difference.)
“La Casa de Papel: El Fenómeno” (Spain) 
Prerequisite: “La Casa de Papel”. If you haven’t seen that one yet, well, where have you been? Now, technically, this isn’t a series, but it’s less than an hour, so you’ll fly through it! “La Casa De Papel” has become an international phenomenon. This documentary takes fans behind the scenes to explore just how the series went from a one-season flop in Spain to an international phenomenon with five seasons (season 5 volume 2 coming soon) and an incredibly engaged fan base. With interviews from actors, interesting tidbits and emotional stories, by the end of the doc you’ll be ready to rewatch “La Casa de Papel” all over again.
“The Rain” (Denmark)
A mysterious, rain-borne illness has wiped out most of Scandinavia’s population. After being stuck in an underground bunker for six years, a brother and sister venture out into the post-apocalyptic world and join a group of other young people on a search for safety and answers — and you guessed it, not everything is as it seems. This ominous sci-fi thriller is gripping in its twists and turns yet touching through the intimate bonds created by people trying to survive.  
“Élite” (Spain)
Murder, sex, money, drugs, drama. “Élite” feels like a mix of true crime, “Gossip Girl” and “Degrassi.” When three working-class teens enroll in an exclusive private school for Spain’s elite, dynamics shift, resulting in the murder of one student. “Élite” paints a campy picture of the lives of Spain’s richest families, full of tension and teenage drama but grounded in important stories with issues of today’s society such as xenophobia, classism, racism and homophobia. The series has all the makings of a perfect binge, and don’t worry, there’s no shortage of content with four seasons plus four extra mini-episodes. So what are you waiting for? (Bonus: a stacked cast of hot actors).
“Störst av Allt” (Sweden)
This series is like “Elite” but with a more eerie tone. The Swedish series is a combination of an edgy teen series, courtroom drama and crime thriller. Journey to the wealthy suburbs of Stockholm as a tragic school shooting at an elite prep school sends shockwaves through the town. And an unusual suspect, 18-year-old Maja (Hanna Ardéhn), is accused of murder. The story flashes between Maja’s current reality as an accused murderer in jail and her memories leading up to the death of her classmate. The flashback form creates an engaging pace that’ll have you hooked as you’re taken along with Maja as she tries to piece together the events for herself. Like “Élite,” the show also delves into important societal issues such as class and segregation. Check out this addictive watch, you won’t be disappointed. 
“Unorthodox”  (United States, Germany)
This critically acclaimed four-part mini series is primarily in Yiddish but also switches between German and English. The series takes you on an intimate and emotional journey of one woman’s path to self-discovery. Esty (played by Israeli actress Shira Haas, who garnered international acclaim for her role in Unorthodox) is a 19-year-old woman who leaves behind her restrictive Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn in search of independence in Berlin. Haas’s stunning performance will make you feel the joy in her discoveries as well as the anxiety and fear of being alone for the first time with a constant threat of being taken back to everything she escaped. The experience is even more riveting as it’s based on a true story.  
“Young Royals” (Sweden)
Two words: young love. This series follows Wilhelm (Edvin Ryding), the prince of Sweden, who’s sent to boarding school after a scandal, and Simon (Omar Rudberg) a day student on a scholarship at the school. A budding romance soon ensues. The tension of these two teens as they navigate their sexuality, the exploration of a new relationship, complex family dynamics and money problems all while being in the public eye, will have you on the edge of your seat. If you start one episode, be prepared for five more in one sitting. By the sixth, you’ll be crying, but eager, for another (luckily the show has been renewed).
“Taco Chronicles” (Mexico) 
Sick of dining hall food? Take a journey to Mexico to experience one of the country’s most emblematic dishes: The taco. This docuseries is a joyful celebration of both the makers and eaters of tacos. Each episode chronicles a new type of taco and its history, preparation and new forms. Hear from food experts, chefs, restaurant-goers and a fun take on narration with each respective taco leading you through the adventure! Maybe the mouthwatering visuals will do more harm than good as you venture back to EVK to real tangible food. But, if you’ve got a kitchen, try out the recipes for yourself — and invite me.

“Succession” poses the question: How far will people go on their quest for power? 
HBO’s satirical series follows a conservative international media conglomerate ruled by the ruthless Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and the conflict surrounding who will take over when and if Logan ever steps down. 
To say I love “Succession” is a massive understatement. When the intro music began to play, I audibly squealed with joy — apologies to my roommates. 
The show is back in all its glory: The writing is tight; the score is epic and the characters are pure evil. 
Season one posits Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong), the Roy’s poster child, for the role, but through a series of missteps, he falls out of grace with the family. Everyone circles Logan like a vulture. The wide variety of cast members play sides and act selfishly. 
One thing looms above them: A scandal in the cruises department threatens to destroy Waystar RoyCo and send Logan to jail. 
In the season two finale, Kendall holds a press conference that exposes his father for knowing about the cover up in cruises. Season three picks up here. 
For two years, “Succession” fans have rewatched, re-binged and anxiously awaitied the third season. While it remained one of the most anticipated returns to television, it did not disappoint. 
The first episode came swinging with full force. The opening shot shows helicopters flying in tandem across a blue sky in Europe, an immediate introduction to the lavish and extravagant wealth of the Roys’ world. 
Since money is limitless in the world of the Roys, every scene looks like a playground of fantasy. Flying effortlessly from country to country in private jets and helicopters showcases an unattainable amount of wealth that forces a particular perspective on the family. 
One of the most brilliant things about “Succession” is its expansive world building. It’s best navigated through Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) who is not used to the extravagant wealth and often sticks out like a sore thumb. He’s the relatable character that grounds the family and guides the audience. 
For the Roys — Shiv (Sarah Snook), Roman (Kieran Culkin) and Connor (Alan Ruck) — luxury is a normality. They are so nonchalant about money it verges on sickening. 
Next we transition to Kendall in New York taking deep guttural breaths, attempting to control just one aspect of his life, now that he’s denounced his father for the world to see. 
Following the slow and careful re-introduction of all the characters, the fast paced environment of the show steps in to dominate the remainder of the episode. 
The direction of the show is masterful. Each character is heavily satirized through specific, over-the-top mannerisms. 
Jeremy Strong delivered a skilled performance of Kendall’s anxiety. The show always digs at Kendall’s difficult relationship with his father. The excellent characterization of Kendall is an unparalleled masterclass in writing, directing and acting. Each twitch of Kendall’s lip and stutter is telling of how fantastic Strong’s performance of the character is. 
One of the show’s strongest aspects is the dehumanizing brilliant one-liners. My personal favorite from Sunday’s episode was an exchange from Logan to Kendall via phone. 
“Then I’m going to grind his fucking bones to make my bread,” Logan said. 
Each quip is a Shakespearean masterpiece of eloquence and profanity. 
The art of “Succession” is its ability to create empathy for characters who, at their core, are rotten, selfish people. 
Comedy-wise, the show is dryer than a perfect martini. I find myself laughing out loud at each of the characters’ quips. While it’s an American comedy, the show isn’t a sitcom or “American” by any standards.
The writing on the show often gives me secondhand anxiety. You begin to feel like you are in the conference room while someone talks out of their ass. My stomach will be in knots until I remember I’m not really there. The writing is that good. 
In an era where misinformation remains a great threat, a show about the perils of running a media-conglomerate is not only ripe with drama, but also relevant to everyday life. 
I’m not sure if it’s particularly important to me as a journalist, but “Succession” peels away the wall between the CEO and everyday Joe to promise its audience that it’s all about self-interest. Every single move is selfish. Every single play is rehearsed. 
Kendall revealing his father’s personal hand in the cruise scandal was not something he did for the victims but, instead, a selfish choice to boost his reputation. At its core, “Succession” is a character study on power. 
The remainder of the season is positioned, in the words of Logan, to be “full fucking beast.” 
Episode one sets up a rich minefield of family versus family drama and promises to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. 
“Succession” airs on HBO every Sunday at 6 p.m.

A week doesn’t go by without a person being canceled. Whether it’s an NFL coach or Jeopardy host, people are getting Etch-a-Sketched out of public life in a New York minute and presumably never heard from again, typically for a past transgression.
Cancel culture is wholly contingent on a person’s transgressions. There are the Harvey Weinsteins and Jon Grudens of the world who are beyond reproach, leaving no place for rehabilitation. In these cases, cancel culture is warranted. However, there are other instances where transgressions are more benign, leaving room for growth. To understand if cancel culture befits a particular person, one must assess the severity of the wrongdoing. 
The topic of cancel culture hits particularly close to home with Olivia Jade. Her name has become part and parcel of USC culture, inducing jokes about rowing or bribing your way into school. After the 2019 Operation Varsity Blues college admissions scandal broke, various actors, media moguls and elite private schools found themselves in the crosshairs of public scrutiny. However, Olivia Jade Giannulli, better known by her YouTube handle, Olivia Jade, became the scandal’s poster child. Jade’s story underscores how cancel culture often affects people with privilege differently.
To secure Jade and her older sister admission to USC, their parents, Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli,  paid $500,000 and fabricated athlete profiles of the two as rowers — hence the pervasive jokes about rowing. Before USC rebranded itself as a leading academic institution, it was generally known as a breeding ground for the wealthy, many of whom didn’t have the same academic standings as UCLA students. The scandal only compounded USC’s stigma as the “University of Spoiled Children.” 
Following the college scandal, Jade promptly dropped out of USC and took a hiatus from social media, only to break her silence in December 2020 on Facebook’s “Red Table Talk.” During her media appearance, Jade said, “What’s so important to me is to now learn from the mistake, not to now be shamed, and punished, and never given a second chance. I’m 21 — I feel like I deserve a second chance, to redeem myself, to show I’ve grown. I’m not trying to victimize myself. I don’t want pity. I don’t deserve pity. We messed up. I just want a second chance to be like ‘I recognize I messed up.’” 
The problem here is two-fold. Simply recognizing her faults doesn’t rectify the problem. Recognition is certainly part of growing, but the two concepts shouldn’t be conflated. It’s also problematic that she boils the issue down to a mere mess-up. This expectancy that she should be forgiven — coupled with her simplification of a much more nuanced problem — highlights her privilege. 
Following the “Red Table Talk” appearance, Jade continues to dip her toes back in the water. She resurfaced on YouTube, competes on “Dancing with the Stars”  and plans to release her own podcast this fall. Her experience fully epitomizes the long-standing debate about cancel culture. While we should eventually uncancel her, we cannot know she genuinely reformed unless she acknowledges her privileged experience.
It’s as if Jade was put in a proverbial timeout but, as a child of privilege, was able to literally cash in with newfound opportunities. It begs the question, would “DWTS” really have casted her had she not been enveloped in the infamous scandal? Was she given a get out of jail free card as the gilded offspring of a celebrity? By pleading ignorance to her parents’ egregious behavior, and publicly apologizing, she managed to weaponize her privilege to gain opportunities. 
It’s important that we rethink cancel culture so that it allows people opportunities to rehabilitate and grow. However, as seen in the case of Olivia Jade, cancel culture affects everyone differently and people with privilege often get off scot-free. For her to grow, Jade must recognize the privilege that softened her canceling in the first place. Maybe then our culture could work toward accepting her without cracking incessant rowing team jokes.

Although USC popular culture characterizes the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism as one large sorority — whether you would like to be a part of it or not —  it would be intellectually dishonest to paint the school as a cohesive sisterhood. Tucked away in this campus’s most bustling corner, you’ll find Wallis Annenberg Hall, the contentious home of two species in constant rivalry: the “annenbaddie” and the sports journalism bro.
I like to think of the “annenbaddie” as an Annenberg student’s innate form — only an Annenberg baddie could acquire their radiating glow, possess a signature style and, if not partial to femininity, at least have a deep admiration for it.
Undermining the straight men of Annenberg, my freshman year mind subconsciously created the imaginary sports journalism major. It took multiple conversations with friends, my mouth continuously agape, for me to believe there was no sports journalism major in Annenberg. The course of study was a figment of my imagination, created to rationalize the existence of straight men within our school.
While grieving the shattered idyllic and femme-centered Annenberg I crafted in my mind, I grew dismissive of the so-called sports journalism bros. Why are you, as a straight man, in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism? So distant from this demographic of people, I struggled to see them beyond their game rundowns and score tallies.
But after assessing my various annoyances with the film boys of the School of Cinematic Arts or the sickly-looking Timothée Chalamet wannabes of the Roski School of Art and Design, I was forced to critique my ideas of the sports journalism bro. 
This process was accelerated by my growing resentment for the trend of straight men commodifying femininity to seem desirable to women, coupled with my “Real Housewives of Atlanta” addiction and, thus, an appreciation for Nene Leakes’ philosophy that straight men should at all times, “Stay outta women’s business.” 
Suddenly, I had a newfound appreciation for the sports journalism bro’s voluntary exile. Their topical distance increasingly began to feel less threatening and more comforting. And, once I really started looking into the craft, I began to recognize sports journalists’ willingness to explore larger social discussions, even with an audience we wouldn’t necessarily assume is receptive to it. 
From boycotts undertaken by entire teams, scathing tweets written by the likes of Lebron James or political connections made by sports anchors who aren’t afraid to broach serious topics, the sports journalism world is increasingly forced to confront the role of racial identity and discrimination on and off the field.
“We saw it, especially a lot over the last year, whether it’s boycotting games or whether it’s kneeling during the national anthem,” said Nathan Ackerman, a sports co-director at Annenberg Media. “Just using postgame interviews and press conferences as a platform to talk about social justice, racial inequality, things like that.”
Reagan Griffin Jr., editor at Annenberg Media’s “Black.” desk echoed the value of exploring racial politics and other hard-hitting topics through sports.
“My beat, you could call it, would be sports with a specific focus in the intersections of Blackness and other societal mechanisms,” Griffin said. “Whether that be politics, social justice, economics, that’s where my interest has been piqued as of late … how we can view the world around us within the context of sports?”
Many of these male sports enthusiasts were also critical about the absence of non-men — see: annenbaddies — from the fold of sports journalism, recognizing it is often due to long-standing barriers and not a lack of interest — me being the exception.
“Women have to assert their ethos more,” Griffin said. “[For example], the whole trope of the woman who likes sports is [she’s] always asked, ‘Oh, what sport do you like?’ There’s a lot more questioning.”
Both Ackerman and Griffin pointed toward the field’s reckoning with the framing of athletes as one of the most valuable conversations needed among reporters; not only because it evoked discourse on the potentially dehumanizing impacts of media — I’m looking at you TMZ — but also because it evoked discourse on racial biases. The phrases, “That guy’s an animal,” or “She’s not human” were especially on Griffin’s mind.
Despite his personal affinity for these broader topics, Griffin defended students who don’t cover stories under a large framework, such as those who simply show up to the basketball game for the recap. These students, he said, imbue USC with its prideful sports culture and carry on a legacy of intoxicating story-telling within sports journalism, invoking NBA analyst, TV personality and thriving Twitter meme, Stephen A. Smith, as an example of this ability.
“When you look at some of the most impactful stories of all time, a lot of them are just game stories,” Griffin said. “And the sort of eloquence that some people have — the gift that some people have for just painting the picture of what a game was — I think that’s something that is really enthralling for me.”
Considering these confrontations, conversations and narratives in the realm of sports journalism, it would be a disservice to the journalistic tradition to write off the sports journalism bro. When someone can write beautiful three-act prose about middle-aged men strolling along a golf range, how could we possibly not give them their kudos? 
And, while the efforts toward upholding in-depth story-telling, or simply riling up USC’s audience are commendable, the real value in the sports journalism bro is his willingness to spark important discussions on humanity, gender and race in his own medium instead of imposing this burden onto the non-men in their newsroom. It’s certainly more comforting than adopting superficial symbols of femininity to signal their supposed deviation from toxic masculinity. What more could an annenbaddie ask for?
