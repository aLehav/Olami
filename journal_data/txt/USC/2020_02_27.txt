The race for the Democratic presidential nomination began with 28 candidates. Now, there are just eight. As 2020 speeds by, the Democrats should be starting to feel a sense of urgency to find the right candidate. 
However, the path to the Democratic nomination has been a wild, confusing ride. The candidates have all competed in a closely contested battle, but the sheer number of people running and the wide range of views and ideas have resulted in a murky mess that might leave voters a bit conflicted or perplexed. 
Let’s not forget all the drama and conflict that occurred this past year in the Democratic field either. Every year, the candidates have participated in a copious amount of mudslinging and squabbling.
All of this might seem strangely familiar. What show revolves around about 30 candidates, one goal and plenty of drama? I don’t know about you, but that sounds eerily similar to “The Bachelor” to me.
“The Bachelor” and the primaries have some eye-opening similarities that allude to a troubling fact: American politics today resembles a reality TV show where audiences don’t know what’s real or fake.
While this might appear to be a trivial comparison, it actually suggests that the presidential candidates are prone to acting like the contestants on “The Bachelor.” As we have all learned, contestants can be toxic and dramatic because of their situation — and based on my observations, the race for the nomination breeds the same kind of poisonous behavior. 
Just as the set-up of “The Bachelor” pits women against each other and sends an anti-feminist message, the set-up of the presidential nomination pits candidates of the same party — who are supposed to share most beliefs — against each other, causing in-party hostility. As a result, the Democratic voting bloc stands divided and fails to unite behind one candidate.
For example, the rivalry between Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren has escalated because of their competition in the Democratic field. They recently beefed after Warren claimed that, in 2018, Sanders said that the chance of a woman becoming president this year would be slim. 
This conflict reminded me of “The Bachelor” incident when Kelsey accused Hannah Ann of stealing the champagne she had saved for Peter, and the two immediately engaged in an unpleasant conversation full of denial and disagreement. 
The Democratic race also resembles “The Bachelor” through the theatrical staging of the debates. While they are meant for the voters to learn more about the candidates and what they stand for, they mostly turn into popularity contests with a lot of arguing and minimal attention to policy initiatives. 
To me, debates don’t seem too different from group dates on “The Bachelor,” where several, but not all, of the candidates get a chance to show off to the audience. The contestants on “The Bachelor” and presidential candidates know how important those group dates and debates are. Thus, both groups are willing to do whatever it takes to stand out to the crowd, even when that comes at the expense of others.
For “Bachelor” contestants, that might take the form of cheating on an obstacle course like Kelley did to get alone time with Peter, leaving the other contestants who followed the rules in the dust. For the presidential candidates, it might come in the form of taking low blows at others and puffing up your own resume, just like when Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden feuded over their Social Security policies after Sanders accused Biden of wanting to limit Social Security spending. 
Indeed, politics has been overrun with distractions and is dominated by image and branding. Instead of focusing on what actually matters, American politics has turned into a massive circus where making your opponents look dumb takes priority over actually accomplishing things that make a difference. People talk about bipartisanship and reform, but right now, we are headed down a path of polarization. As a result, politics has taken on the look of a reality TV show, where politicians are irrational and emotional, leaving voters confused heading into the 2020 election.

Most people go to college looking to make a name for themselves. Maya Washington just wanted to be a number.
Washington always felt singled out as a kid. Growing up in Plymouth and Wayzata, Minn., she was one of the few Black students in her schools. This lack of diversity was evident in her yearbooks, which went entire pages without displaying a photo of a person of color.
However, she was singled out even more as the youngest daughter of Gene Washington, a former wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings and a Michigan State legend. To fit into a community where she wouldn’t always be the focus of attention, she decided to go to USC, a bigger and more diverse population where no one would know what her father accomplished.
It wasn’t until after she graduated with a bachelor’s in dramatic arts that Maya realized she really wanted to learn more about her father’s past. At a 2011 memorial for Bubba Smith, one of her father’s teammates at Michigan State, Maya met many of Gene’s friends, all of whom told her stories that got her creative mind spinning.
USC Visions and Voices screened Maya’s film “Through the Banks of the Red Cedar” Feb. 6 at the auditorium in Wallis Annenberg Hall. The film, which premiered at the 2018 Detroit Free Press Film Festival, follows Maya’s discovery of her father’s history as a pioneer football player, a wide receiver out of Texas who was recruited to Michigan State because Southern teams did not recruit Black players.
Then-Spartans head coach Duffy Daugherty sought a competitive advantage by recruiting in the untapped African American communities south of the Mason- Dixon Line, and it paid off. Michigan State won back-to-back national championships in 1965 and 1966, making a nationwide statement about the value of recruiting Black players. 
“We didn’t know what we were doing,” said Clinton Jones, a Spartans running back who entered the program with Gene and soon became his close friend. “We chained together as young men, 17 or 18 years old, who played football at Michigan State, and all we wanted to do was play football … We had no idea that we would create, through our victories, a momentum, and a joy and a happiness that permeated the campus and the United States, especially for people of color.”
For his role on those championship teams, Gene was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011. He also won the 1969 NFL Championship with the Minnesota Vikings.
Maya was born shortly after her father’s career concluded in 1974, and because he didn’t push his children to take part in sports or talk much about his playing days, she didn’t think too much about his role in history. Through making the film, she discovered a lot about what her father accomplished, and they’re both thankful the process brought them closer together.
“For most of us, we know our parents in terms of whatever profession or work they did when they left the house and came home at the end of the day, however many jobs they worked to provide for a family,” she said. “But to understand the significance of what historical things may or may not have taken place around those experiences, I think was a big eye-opener for me.”
Her father, known by family and friends as humble and soft-spoken, shared that sentiment.
“It really gave us an opportunity, especially for me to get to know her a lot better,” Gene said. “She was finding out all this information from family members and learning a lot about her dad. I found it very interesting and a pleasant surprise that really made me think.”
While making the film, Maya was surprised by the subjects’ accounts of their experiences with racism. She was expecting to hear of the heinous acts and righteous response typical of the Civil Rights era, but her father and his teammates said everyone got along at Michigan State for the most part.
Maya said this opened her eyes to the different frames through which she and her parents experienced racism. She remembers learning about the era her father grew up in, where people who looked like him lived every day with the threat of being embarrassed and rejected simple services such as eating in a restaurant or staying in a hotel.
“The way my dad saw it was ‘I get a meal plan where I have food, I have a place to sleep and I’m getting an education in exchange for my passion and ability to run track, play football and win championships,’” she said. “And so from their standpoint, if someone looked at them funny, or called them a name or did anything that by today’s standards would be considered inappropriate and grounds for some kind of action or clapback, in my dad’s day, you didn’t really have a place to go.”
Maya clearly had a different college experience than her father. There were more people who looked like her at USC, and she made sure to apply to live in Somerville Place, an African American student housing community, to foster that sense of belonging. 
And yet, the sense of being othered didn’t stop at USC, which, while more diverse than the Minnesota areas she grew up in, was still a predominantly white school. Maya was one of the Black students in her theatre program who, along with Latinx and Asian American classmates, had to appeal to their dean and administrators to diversify their Eurocentric course material, which didn’t feature many minority creators.
As opposed to her father, who shrugged off even explicit racism, Maya recognized microaggressions that acted as a way for white students and faculty to express their ignorance. She recalled performing a monologue from “Sally’s Rape,” a Black feminist play by Robbie McCauley, which was an ambitious choice for the assignment. The response was less than supportive.
Her classmates stared at her with “a deer in the headlights look.” Some of them left the class because they didn’t have the maturity to handle the experience.
Still, Maya enjoyed her time at USC because she had the opportunity to pursue all the creative directions her heart desired. Since graduating, she has worked as a writer, director, performer and art educator with experience in areas from film and theater to public art and social activism. 
After the February screening concluded, Maya was nearly mobbed by her many friends in attendance. Her smile only seemed to get wider as she greeted friends and family, and it never wavered when meeting the strangers that her friends brought along to the event.
Anisha Acharya, who became Maya’s editor midway through the filmmaking process, attributed Maya’s positive, energetic attitude to her performative background.
“We had all of these fun sequences and montages that we constructed basically inspired out of that energy that she has, because she was so excited,” Acharya said. “That definitely factored into the process of how we approached stylistically what she wanted the documentary to be like.”
Gene said he is proud of all Maya has accomplished, but the film is the work of hers that hits closest to home for him.
“When you’re trying to put a documentary together or tell a story, there’s a whole lot of qualities that you as a person have to have,” he said. “That patience, that discipline and determination, and working hard to get better and get it done. I’ve seen all of that, and I’m so, so proud that she has mastered that skill.”
Gene’s pride in Maya’s work speaks to not only how strong their relationship has always been, but also the unique role “Through the Banks of the Red Cedar” has had in bringing them closer together. Maya relished the chance to screen the film at USC. At the place she went to escape from Gene’s shadow, she and her father got to celebrate the thing that brought them closer together.
“It was really special to have made this screening of the film and coming full circle of embracing and loving my dad’s history, and loving him through that history and being able to share that openly on this campus,” Maya said.

“Happy New Year, Trojans,” President Carol Folt captioned a Jan. 1 Instagram post featuring a Trojan Marching Band player with a trumpet in one hand, making the “Fight On” signal with the other. “Here’s to 2020.”
“Everyday I pray to god u leave Southern california you’re a terrible leader and have ruined 2020 already,” one commenter wrote. 
“Could’ve been a happy new year, but you ruined SC football,” wrote another. “You suck, Carol.”
“Love USC. Hate you,” chimed in a third. 
“You’ve ruined the decade already,” said one user in the comment section of a Folt post nine days later. Seven others like the comment in agreement.
“Go to HELL Folt,” one user replied to a Dec. 26 post, clearly still relishing in the joy and good spirits of the day before.
I’ve noticed a popular refrain — a call to action of sorts — in the world of sports these days, and it goes as such: Keep politics out of sports. 
It’s a popular opinion, one with which I disagree. I hold the view that sports are political as is, that there’s nothing we can do to remove politics from sports without upsetting a massive proportion of the United States population and, frankly, that we shouldn’t even try to do so in the first place. 
The rapidly-increasing intertwinement of politics and sports is what many people claim threatens the purity of sports as we know them. 
I find this misleading. 
The problem that contributes to the shameful toxicity in the sporting world today is not the sociopolitical issues we choose to include in the realm of sports but rather somewhat of the contrary: how far we allow sports to dominate our everyday lives and influence our perception of everything around us. 
The aforementioned Folt vs. Dedicated Disgruntled Disheartened Trojan showdowns prevalent on literally any of her Instagram posts came to mind after I read of repulsive developments in the baseball world last Friday. Houston Astro Josh Reddick, a member of the team during the 2017 cheating scandal, told reporters at the team’s Spring Training facility in West Palm Beach, Fla., that he had received death threats and wishes for his children to get cancer via social media in the wake of the cheating revelations.
I don’t even need to say how disgusting this is — that much should be painfully obvious. 
If you’ve read the first approximately-400 words of this column and have so far concluded that I’m equating mean comments on a school president’s Instagram to hopes that a child develops cancer, you’re greatly mistaken and are missing the point entirely. 
I’m not of the “it’s just a game” crowd. Anyone who has ever played sports understands that often, it’s not just a game. It’s part of what makes us who we are. But I also understand that sports aren’t everything, and that’s where the Reddick-Folt comparison applies. I love sports, I appreciate the role they play in our society and I get pissed off when my teams lose. But I don’t allow sports to seep into every other facet of my life. And that understanding is where many sports aficionados fall short.
The problem isn’t our unwillingness to keep the outside world out of sports, it’s our inability to establish reasonable boundaries between the aspects of our lives that should include sports and those that shouldn’t. This inability is what leads some fans to claim Folt ruins their day, month, year, decade, century, millennium, and wishing her to burn because of it. And, in extreme cases, it’s what leads the lowest of the low to project their inhumanity onto, yes, a cheater, at least by association, but a human being nonetheless — and his less-than-five-month-old twins. 
I hate the Astros. With a burning passion. And President Folt, if you’re reading this, I wholeheartedly disagree with your — er, athletic director Mike Bohn’s — decision to retain Clay Helton for the 2020 season. I also hope you’re having a nice week and that you didn’t trip and fall on your way to Bovard this morning.
Again, I’m not at all equating these two examples. One is far sicker and more disgusting than the other, but they’re both microcosms — to varying degrees — of a problematic sports climate in which society dehumanizes the figures we’re trained to treat as one-dimensional, forgetting that each of these individuals have lives apart from sports which are far more significant than how they play or the personnel decisions they make.
Reddick, Folt and all the sports figures that we’ve targeted with our sick culture of toxicity are human beings. One of them was on a cheating team, one retained an underperforming head coach. These are both bad things. They don’t deserve to rot in hell for them. The sports community, hopefully a small minority of it, needs to take a long look in the mirror and consider that maybe, just maybe, we tend to blow things out of proportion — affecting not only our personal happiness but also the people onto whom we project our anger, and it casts a shameful light onto the world of sports.
Have we any decency?

Members of the historic 1983-84 USC women’s basketball team gathered at the Ray Stark Family Theatre on USC’s campus Wednesday evening to celebrate the premiere of HBO’s upcoming documentary “Women of Troy.”
The premiere served to highlight the accomplishments of the historic former Trojans who made a profound impact both on and off the court. 
“Creating an infrastructure and a mythology where girls understand that there have been greats in the game for years and years before them creates a foundation to build off of,” said Gary Cohen, president of Triple Threat TV and one of the film’s producers. “I’m thrilled that I had a part in keeping [the team’s] story alive.” 
The documentary focuses on the dominance of the team led by Cheryl Miller, Cynthia Cooper-Dyke and twin sisters Pamela and Paula McGee and the effect that their immense success had on the eventual inception of the WNBA and advancement of women’s sports collectively. 
Four-time WNBA champion and Finals MVP Cynthia Cooper-Dyke was hopeful about the impact the film will have on generations moving forward.
“I hope this movie inspires,” Cooper-Dyke said before the screening. “[I hope it] inspires the younger generation to fight hard for what you want, to work hard for what you want so that you can achieve anything no matter where you came from or when you started.” 
Along with the aforementioned members of the team, dignitaries in attendance included executive producer Bill Simmons from The Ringer, Los Angeles Lakers center JaVale McGee and USC athletic director Mike Bohn. 
JaVale, son of Pamela McGee, expressed pride and gratitude for his mother’s accomplishments during her time at USC.
“It’s amazing,” JaVale said. “It just shows an abundance of hard work really pays off and I’m just honored to be able to see it. I can’t wait.”
Members of the current USC women’s basketball team were also in attendance. Freshman guard India Otto was complimentary of the film and the impact it had on her as a young athlete.
“It was extremely important for us to see how far we’ve come as a program,” Otto said. “You think about UConn now and Baylor and things like that, but it really all started here, and I think that’s something we all lost sight of. It’s important to remember that and remember what we’re doing it for as well.” 
Following a red carpet entrance for the guests of honor, attendees convened into the theater for some brief words from HBO Sports Executive Vice President Peter Nelson and the film’s director Alison Ellwood, along with a short performance by the Trojan Marching Band and USC Song Girls. 
Throughout the entirety of the film, both staff and players from the famed 1983 team shared laughs and celebrations while reliving their accomplishments. 
Pamela and Paula McGee expressed appreciation for those involved in creating the film, saying how special it was that every member of the famed group has been widely successful outside of basketball.
“It’s just a great team that gave us a foundation to change the world and we knew that, and it was just a special time for women,” Pamela said ahead of the event. “This particular team was a dynamic group of women that came together for one purpose.”
Paula McGee said the film highlights the unity and determination of the historic USC teams. 
“We just wanted to be the best,” Paula said. “Cynthia and Cheryl and the entire team, we all came with one purpose and that was to be the greatest team ever. And I think we’ll see that today in this HBO documentary.” 
After the film’s screening, members of the team were invited on stage to share brief thoughts of gratitude for friends and family, the film’s producers and USC as a whole for their continued support. 
“Women of Troy” is set to premiere on HBO March 10 at 6 p.m.

USC picked up a crucial 57-48 win over Arizona Thursday night at Galen Center, providing a crucial boost to the Trojans’ prospects of earning a first- round bye at the Pac-12 Tournament and qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. 
Arizona’s 48 points was its lowest mark of the season, an impressive feat for USC head coach Andy Enfield and his defense despite a roster with multiple players battling recent illnesses.
“We just tried to challenge everything,” Enfield said. “We just executed defensively as best as we could and challenged, [we tried] to make it tough for everything they got.” 
Senior guard Jonah Mathews said the effort was an example of the team’s high potential on defense.
“We were just locked in defensively, and we’ve proven to be pretty good defensively when we want,” Mathews said. “We just had to take it to another level.”
The Trojans were led by a balanced scoring attack. Six different players chipped in at least 7 points en route to one of USC’s biggest wins of the season. 
Freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu led the way once again for the Trojans, racking up a team-high 10 rebounds and three blocks to go with 11 points on the evening. Thursday’s performance was Okongwu’s tenth double-double of the season.
Mathews had another solid night, leading the team with 14 points while also grabbing five rebounds and setting the tone for the team for much of the game.
Mathews, along with senior forward Nick Rakocevic, has been sick the past few days but provided a much-needed outing for the Trojans when the team needed it.
“It’s do or die, I don’t have another year, I don’t have any more excuses — it’s do or die,” Mathews said after the game. “Every rebound matters, every loose ball matters, every shot matters.” 
Both teams had frustrating patches in the first 20 minutes, with the Trojans and Wildcats looking out of sync on the offensive end for the majority of the first half. 
A slow start for Enfield’s group saw the team go down 9-2 early, but the deficit was quickly remedied after a pair of tough plays by freshman guard Ethan Anderson gave the Trojans life: A quick layup followed by a steal on the ensuing inbound pass sparked a 9-0 run to give USC a slight 11-9 lead midway through the first half. 
Anderson finished the night leading the team with four steals. 
“He’s just such a tough young man,” Enfield said of Anderson. “He was a huge part of our win.” 
The Wildcats were without senior guard Max Hazzard and the team’s second leading scorer and rebounder in freshman guard Josh Green.
The Trojans were fortunate not to have to face Green, who racked up 18 points and four rebounds when the teams met earlier this season, as Arizona couldn’t seem to accommodate his absence. 
USC also contained Arizona’s leading scorers— freshman forward Zeke Nnaji and freshman guard Nico Mannion — who came into Thursday’s matchup averaging 16.3 and 13.7 points per game, respectively. 
The duo was held to just 5 points combined in the first half, shooting a combined 2-for-11 from the field. As a team, the Wildcats shot just 25.8% from the field in the first half and didn’t fare much better in the second. 
USC’s tepid first half was capped off in exciting fashion when Okongwu nailed his first collegiate 3-pointer with a heave beyond halfcourt at the buzzer to send the Trojans into the break with a 26-21 lead. 
The second half was testing at times for the Trojans, as Mannion and company eventually made a run to cut USC’s lead from 11 to just 5 midway through the second half.
Mannion and Nnaji combined for 21 points in the final 20 minutes, but their second- half push ultimately came up short as Okongwu and the Trojans pulled away in the late stages of the game. 
Arizona finished the contest shooting an abysmal 28.1% from the field, including a disappointing 3-of-26 from the 3-point line for a clip of just 11.5%. 
“They focused as best as they could, and I thought they came out tonight with great energy and very much attention to detail defensively,” Enfield said. 
USC will look to follow up its win by continuing to make its March Madness case against Arizona State Saturday. Tipoff is 5 p.m. at Galen Center.

USC has tried hard over the years to shed the nickname “University of Spoiled Children” through millions of dollars in financial aid and an emphasis on admitting first-generation college students. Last week, President Carol Folt announced that beginning in Fall 2020, the University will extend free tuition to first-year undergraduate students whose annual family income is $80,000 or less.
However, it can be easy to overlook the students who are the most financially vulnerable. Approximately 2,000 students are experiencing homelessness or have in the past year at USC. 
There are several ongoing efforts to help the homeless community on and around campus. Sandeep Suresh, a senior majoring in computer science, created a website that compiles resources for students experiencing homelessness, including information about local food pantries and emergency housing services. An eight-member executive board including students from the Price, Marshall and Annenberg schools came together to build Trojan Shelter for students in the Los Angeles area who are housing insecure. 
Going forward, the University must continue to support student-led projects against homelessness as well as provide assistance at the institutional and academic levels.
USC should consider adding more classes to educate students on homelessness and how to combat it. Earlier this year, USC’s Gould School of Law partnered with the USC Homelessness Initiative to offer a homelessness advocacy externship class. The University could offer similar classes in other schools to raise awareness and develop strategies to put an end to student homelessness. 
The student-led projects are proving to be effective because the students are utilizing platforms and skills that align with their passions in their respective fields. Similarly, offering a diverse range of classes about homelessness in different schools will allow students to tackle the issue from their own areas of specialty, which will likely yield better results.
USC’s Trojan Food Pantry currently offers food to any student who needs it once a week. While this program is a good start, it may not be enough to fit the needs of students who are experiencing homelessness or food insecurity. The dining halls could partner with food redistribution companies to serve surplus food to food-insecure students. This would also serve to decrease the food waste that the University produces.
The University should also consider expanding financial aid to cover housing costs for students whose annual family income is below a certain margin. Though tuition composes the bulk of the cost of attendance, housing and meal plans combined still total upward of $10,000 a year. Providing aid toward this portion of the cost of attendance will reduce the economic burden on students and ensure that they will be housed for the duration of the school year.
In addition, the University should provide short-term emergency housing on campus for students who have been displaced with short notice. USC’s Trojan Shelter in Koreatown is currently able to house six college students at a time, so creating a similar establishment closer to the University will be beneficial to alleviate worries about the commute to campus.
Finally, USC should continue to advocate for homelessness awareness, especially within — but not limited to — the University community. National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, which takes place the week before Thanksgiving, was recognized on campus last year in the form of a documentary showing, a panel and a banquet. In the future, the University should promote these events more heavily and encourage campus-wide participation. Awareness-building should also occur year-round because as long as the issue remains hidden and stigmatized, it will remain difficult to address.
As a whole, the school and its students should recognize that while adequate food and housing might seem like a given for some, it is not for others. Students cannot thrive if their basic needs are not met. As an institution responsible for raising the next generations of scholars and leaders, USC must ensure that all its students are properly housed and fed.

USC is expected to make sweeping changes following a U.S. Department of Education investigation into the University’s Title IX procedures, which revealed that USC failed to protect students from sexual abuse and misconduct by former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, the department announced Thursday. 
The Office for Civil Rights, a sub-agency of the Department of Education, is ordering the University to restructure its Title IX procedures by conducting a formal review into previous and current employees to gauge if they properly responded to sexual misconduct complaints. The office will also monitor the University, which signed an agreement complying with the reforms, for three years to ensure compliance, according to documents.
“What we have found at USC is shocking and reprehensible,” Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth Marcus said in a press release from the Department of Education. “No student should ever have to face the disgusting behavior that USC students had to deal with. I am pleased that President [Carol] Folt is now committing to major changes, and we will closely monitor the University to make sure that it complies with our agreement.”
The investigation, which began in May 2018, was opened after a Los Angeles Times investigation brought to light hundreds of accusations of sexual misconduct against Tyndall. Since then, Tyndall has been accused by more than 600 women of performing improper pelvic and breast exams, making inappropriate comments during exams and photographing women’s genitals.
“We share OCR’s mission to foster a campus environment free from discrimination and harassment. There is no higher priority for me than protecting the health, safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and patients,” Folt said in a USC news release. “I will continue to work diligently to restore trust in this institution and build a strong foundation of integrity and accountability. By signing this agreement, we are confirming our commitment to work in partnership with OCR to further a culture and climate where students, faculty and staff can learn, work and thrive.” 
USC will have to provide a plan to restructure its Title IX procedures and improve its record keeping by April. 
During the 21-month investigation, the OCR found that USC lacks a recordkeeping system to effectively keep track of multiple complaints against one employee and said the current system has failed to ensure accountability when reporting and responding to Title IX cases, particularly with those involving Tyndall. In addition, the OCR report raised the concern that the Office of General Counsel had possibly undermined the independence of one of the Title IX coordinators by going beyond its advisory role.  
According to a letter sent to Folt from the OCR, the Office of Equity and Diversity, which oversees Title IX, failed to conduct Title IX-compliant investigations into cases involving Tyndall. The Department of Education’s investigation found that the University failed to respond appropriately and in a timely manner to allegations of sexual harassment, citing three instances in which Tyndall’s patients reported his abuse to the OED and the office did not launch Title IX investigations. The University also failed to provide a notice of outcome to five patients, along with not investigating two cases of digital penetration without the patients’ consent, according to the letter.
“Since at least 2000, the University had notice of possible sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment by Employee 1 [Tyndall] of patients and systemically failed at multiple points in time and at multiple levels of responsibility to respond promptly and effectively to notice of the alleged misconduct during gynecological examinations; its failure may have allowed female students to be subjected to such discrimination for more than a decade,” the letter stated.
In a press release about the resolution, United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos called USC’s systemic failure “heartbreaking” and “inexcusable.”
“Too many at USC turned a blind eye to evidence that Dr. Tyndall was preying on students for years,” DeVos said. “We are grateful to every survivor who came forward to share their story with our OCR investigators. Because of your bravery, we can now work with the University to ensure this never happens to another student on USC’s campus.”
The University has not provided all of the documents requested by the OCR. According to the OCR, the University has withheld 3,638 emails and documents from investigators, stating that the documents are confidential attorney-client communications.
John Manly, who represents 234 women in lawsuits alleging abuse by Tyndall, said the manner in which DeVos denounced the University’s procedures shows that this must be taken seriously, especially considering her track record with Title IX. Devos altered Title IX guidelines in 2018 to give those accused of sexual misconduct more rights during the investigation process. 
“We have a federal agency actually run by somebody who’s got a terrible reputation with Title IX saying, ‘This is as bad as it gets,’” Manly said. “Maybe it’s time to stand up and take notice.”
Manly said he believes that despite this step toward accountability, the University still has a long way to go to remedy its management of the complaints against Tyndall. He said the Board of Trustees should resign for its failure to address the alleged abuse. 
“[Board chairman Rick] Caruso has a lot to answer for, as does the rest of the Board,” Manly said. “They’ve decimated the University’s reputation. They’ve allowed hundreds if not thousands of women to be subject to abuse.” 
Former President C. L. Max Nikias resigned in May 2018 due to pressure from Concerned Faculty of USC, which was angered at his mishandling of various scandals, including Tyndall’s sexual misconduct and former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito’s partying with prostitutes and usage of drugs while seeing patients.
“Remember, Rick Caruso promised an independent investigation of Tyndall that was supposed to be disclosed a year ago, and they’ve decided to keep it secret,” Manly said. “This is not something you can fix with a policy. You need a change of culture, and you need to change the personnel at the top.”
Manly also said he thinks all Title IX Office employees should be fired for their participation in covering up the alleged abuse by Tyndall. 
This is not the first time the OCR has investigated USC’s compliance with Title IX. The office investigated the University’s adoption and execution of Title IX procedures for student complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence from 2010 to 2016 as well as its response to complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence made from 2010 to 2015 for the five individual complainants, according to the letter. The OCR is currently monitoring the 2018 agreement.

Payouts to the patients of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall will be disbursed April 6, according to a statement released by the Tyndall settlement class counsel Wednesday.
As part of the settlement approved Tuesday, the University will fund tiered payouts ranging from $2,500 to $250,000 for Tyndall’s nearly 18,000 former patients. A panel of three experts comprising a gynecologist, a forensic psychologist and a court-appointed special master will decide the value of each payout for class action members who choose to enter an impact statement detailing Tyndall’s abuse, provide evidence of misconduct or submit to an interview with the panel.
The April 6 disbursement will include Tier 1 payments of $2,500 per class member. Members who receive the Tier 1 payment remain eligible to apply for the second and third tiers of compensation, according to court documents.
Attorneys Steve Berman, Annika Martin and Daniel Girard, who represent the plaintiffs in the class action settlement, released a statement Wednesday announcing that the settlement received final approval from the court and discussed the reforms to University sexual and racial misconduct reporting that will be implemented as a result of the agreement.
“We are pleased the Court has approved this historic settlement that provides a measure of closure to thousands of survivors and are proud to have fought alongside them to forge a settlement that holds USC accountable,” the statement read. “We look forward to implementing the agreement, including the groundbreaking reforms to prevent these types of abuses from occurring in the future.”
Tyndall was arrested in June following the release of a Los Angeles Times investigation in May 2018 that revealed hundreds of accusations of sexual abuse over his 28-year tenure at USC Student Health. He has pleaded not guilty to 18 felony counts of sexual assault and 11 counts of sexual battery occurring between 2009 and 2016 and will stand trial in a separate criminal case conducted by the L.A. District Attorney’s Office.

Last winter, when USC student Mohammed Usama and his sister Fatema Jahra saw the inefficiency of the pager system at Lenox Hill, one of the busiest hospitals in New York City, Usama got the inspiration for Wave, an app that was selected to be mentored by WorkBench SC, an on-campus venture studio that collaborates with startups to help bring their ideas to life. 
The app eliminates the use of pagers to increase hospital staff response time and ultimately improve patient care.
“The purpose of Wave is to increase efficiency in high acuity medical settings,” said Usama, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering. “Right now, medical personnel use pagers which is very old technology to [contact] people when they actually need [to complete a hospital task], which makes it hard for them to prioritize urgency levels.” 
The app, still in the development phase since last summer but looking at a completion date in two months, works by allowing messaging between different hospital personnel while prioritizing patients’ needs and mitigating the inefficiencies and limitations of using pagers and traditional phones. 
According to Jahra, a neurosurgery physician assistant at Lenox Hill Hospital, replacing the current pager system with Wave would allow her to perform her hospital duties more efficiently, especially while attending to a vast number of patients a day.
“[There are a lot] of limitations and as my job covering … patients who are very sick and very acute and very complex, I need to prioritize what needs to be done faster, what needs to be done as a task list and what needs to be just communicated,” Jahra said. 
The app will also allow for task lists that help differentiate urgent calls, general questions and coordinated projects, whereas the current pager system does not specify caller ID, urgency level or location of the caller’s location. 
According to Jahra, the app will help increase efficiency in her hospital workspace by allowing users to allocate to hospital workers specific tasks that need to be completed as well as document the tasks as they complete them. She said that the app would help in time-sensitive hospital procedures. 
“I’m actually reminding someone three, four times for the same thing,” Jahra said. “Then I’m checking to see if it’s done … It’s a lot of steps. [With the app], when I send a lab to someone, it automatically will give them an alarm for [the time it’s due] and they won’t be able to turn it off until they actually complete it.” 
After starting the project when Usama was visiting home in New York last summer to solidify the idea and create a prototype for the app, the two continued to work on the app during Usama’s  studies at USC. They find ways to work together through weekly phone calls to discuss future planning and scheduling that includes surveying more workers in different hospitals.
Jahra is currently in the process of surveying hospital workers at the Northwell Health System as well as other hospitals including Mount Sinai, New York Presbyterian and New York University. She is specifically looking at hospitals that have inpatient acute care settings such as intensive care units, emergency departments and telemetry units to determine which hospitals could benefit from Wave.
According to Usama, Wave is currently facing difficulties in gauging future consumer needs that should be implemented in the app. He and Jahra are unsure whether the app will be implemented in hospitals or for the general public to use and whether it will fit each hospital’s needs. 
“Every hospital and every wing in every hospital is different,” Usama said. “So the fine line between what kind of hospital needs this and what kind of hospital doesn’t is very vague.” 
For the past two weeks, Workbench has been helping to develop the app and continue surveying hospital workers in Southern California, Chicago and New York. 
According to Usama, WorkBench  SC has also helped him develop Wave by using the National Science Foundation’s “lean methodology,” a curriculum that operates on the guiding principles of respect for people and continuous improvement. Usama said the “lean” method has been beneficial because it has helped him emphasize the importance of research before releasing his app.
“The ‘lean’ method mitigates the risks associated with startups by a lot, and in a weird way, the lean method has a lot of counterintuitive things you should do,” Usama said. “They focus on customer discovery a lot more than the prototypes. You can do prototypes later — before that, you need to find out if there’s a market there.” 
Andrew Brilliant, the director of operations of WorkBench SC, said Usama’s application stood out as a concept that aligned with the values of WorkBench SC which looks for startups that will economically and sustainably shape industries that businesses are involved in.
“We found that his app solves a really good problem,” Brilliant said. “It helps people, which is a big thing for us. We want to be as helpful to people and to USC students as we can, and it is properly executable in the sense that it’s something that we could accomplish with the resources we presently have.” 
Usama and his sister plan to launch the first usable version of the product that will be distributed to consumers of Wave within the next two months. The first version of the app will be available at Lenox Hill and further developed according to users’ experience. 
“I’m excited to start with my own hospital and firsthand see the effect [of Wave],” Jahra said. “My goal is to develop an app that will be multifunctional and will have a capacity to allow for prioritization, coordination of care and increased efficiency and decreased error.”

When building a prototype to extract water from the Moon and Mars, a team of 10 Viterbi students worried about having enough money to buy material to build their project. 
In March, they will reach the halfway mark for a NASA engineering design competition. 
The annual Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts — Academic Linkage college competition: Moon to Mars Ice and Prospecting Challenge required teams to design and build a prototype to extract water from the Moon and Mars. 
The team, Trojan H20 Extraction System and Evaluation of Underground Services, is the first from USC to compete in the challenge. The students outlined and built a system that they hope will be able to find ice by drilling through the lunar and Martian surface for water extraction.
David Barnhart, director of the USC Space Engineering Research Center, serves as the adviser for the team and is responsible for coordinating its funding with University administrators. Barnhart encouraged the team to take part in the competition. 
“Student teams are successful and are sustainable based upon the passion of the students themselves,” said Barnhart, a research professor in the Department of Astronautical Engineering. “This year, both teams … are made up of very passionate and motivated students.”
Sindhoora Tallapragada, who joined the team in Fall 2019 and now serves as the student team leader, said the team has been designing the water extraction prototype and ordering supplies since January and started building the device in February. The team hopes to complete the device by March 15. 
“We weren’t sure we’d make it past the first day, but we did our best, and we’re all really excited to build the instrument,” said Tallapragada, a graduate student studying astronautical engineering. “The proposal and the building have been very different or have had two very different sets of challenges. The hardest part was getting the proposal together.”
The team was broken into smaller divisions to build the prototype drill which has several components such as the frame, the drilling unit that bores up to half a meter of topsoil and half a meter of ice, the heater which melts the ice and the pump that sucks out and filters the water. 
Michael Rhoderick, the leader of the drill team, has been involved in the project since January. He said it has given him plenty of hands-on experience by allowing him to work on a project outside of the classroom. 
“For me, engineering is such a legacy activity,” said Rhoderick, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. “There’s so much nuance that you can’t really understand just by sitting in the classroom — you only pick [it] up by going out in the field or going to the lab or the machine shop and getting your hands dirty.”
Each team received a $5,000 development stipend to build and test its water extraction system and present the physical device at NASA’s Langley Research Center in front of a panel of judges . To win the competition, teams must meet a set of criteria including product design, cost efficiency and feasibility. 
“Mainly, it’s about credibility,” Barnhart said. “Did they do a reasonable assessment from a design and or analysis standpoint? Is the project realizable with current technologies, or do you have to come up with new things in order to make it?”
The team has faced challenges in the past, including difficulties with budget costs to buy equipment and materials to build the prototype. This has since been resolved by redoing the design to lower purchasing costs, in addition to applying for government grants. 
“I believe in our design,” Tallapragada said. “I think it’s a good design, but I don’t know what the other teams have. This is also the first time USC is doing this competition while all the other teams have already been participating for three years.”
The competition, a collaboration between NASA and the National Institute of Aerospace, was created to develop student’s critical thinking and building skills. Rhoderick said the competition provides valuable exposure to the aerospace industry. 
“There’s so many ridiculously good student organizations and most of these are going to be very willing to take whoever, regardless of what your experience is or how many years you’ve been at USC, and that’s how you’re going to really get the experience,” Rhoderick said.

When Mikell Antonio returns home from classes, he steps into a room filled with studio lights, backdrops pushed against burnt orange walls and UPS packages filled with hoodies and shirts, ready to be shipped out to customers. 
Antonio, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering, created his own “luxury streetwear” clothing line during Spring of his freshman year. What started off as a sketch of a shirt evolved into Étoile — a brand selling clothing and accessories that encourage people to be “entirely [themselves],” fearlessly explore their individuality and let that “individuality become a reality,” according to the clothing brand’s website. Antonio said the brand is planning on branching out from men’s streetwear to womenswear and business casual clothing in the future.
“I just want people to love what they’re wearing, [and] love who they are outside of the clothes,” Antonio said.
Having been into fashion since he was young, Antonio remembers selling homemade bow ties at 12 years old and watching “Project Runway,” a fashion design reality show, with his older sister. Antonio began considering pursuing fashion as a career when he started sketching shirt designs in his Trojan Hall dorm room last year. 
“In that moment, I was like, ‘I’m going to make clothing and I’m going to start a company,’” Antonio said. 
When Antonio first approached his mother Arkima McGhee about his idea for Étoile, McGhee said she was thrilled to see her son’s passion but anxious to see if people would buy his clothing.
“As [parents], we want our children to succeed, and so for me, [Étoile] was big,” McGhee said. “He showed so much passion for it, so I was excited for him to step out there on faith not knowing if someone outside of his family would purchase anything.”
To ensure Antonio was committed to his business venture, Antonio’s parents requested a business plan before his father invested money. Antonio started the business plan the same week, spending days working out numbers for each shirt’s cost, price and profit and researching manufacturers and printmakers he could work with.
After his parents approved his business plan, Antonio made an initial order of 80 shirts and began selling to friends, family and students at USC and his Baltimore hometown through hand-to-hand interactions and Instagram. 
To streamline clothing sales and further promote the line, Antonio decided to use a two-week trial to launch a website during mid-April of last year, resulting in larger success. After the website’s creation, Antonio said Étoile’s exposure to 200 online visitors per day increased.
Cameron Green, a friend of Antonio who met him while they were both living in Trojan Hall, witnessed Étoile’s development into the brand it is now.
“When I first met [Antonio], every time I came into his room, he’d be on his iPad doing designs or designing things for t-shirts,” said Green, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration. “I remember when he first told me about the website … and now a year later, the website is up.” 
Translating to “star” in French, “Étoile” is more than just a clothing brand to Antonio. 
“The stars are the perfect description of my life,” Antonio said. “From aerospace to looking at the stars to the fixation I have with space … it all kind of came together for me thinking about how stars are something we all have different meanings for.”
As a clothing line creator and aerospace engineering major, Antonio uses fashion design as a way to balance his artistic and academic engagements. 
“Yes, I’m an engineer and yes, I think like an engineer, but I’m also a creative and am always looking to change things, which makes me an innovator,” Antonio said.
The French name was also deliberate, as Antonio related the “foreign, but familiar” language to the concept of individuality, a central theme of Étoile. 
“The brand is about exploring who you are completely and being an individual,” Antonio said. “[Individuality] is something we have a concept of, but we don’t fully embrace it or understand it, so it’s foreign to us. Foreign, but familiar, [like French].”
Due to the clothing line’s growth, Antonio has begun to work with a small team to brainstorm marketing and photography ideas. Even as Étoile expands, he continues to remain involved with every part of the business: Before every order is shipped to its customer, Antonio ensures the product’s quality and fit are up to par. Antonio also frequently reviews his site to see which products are popular and then makes improvements accordingly, whether it’s adjusting the graphics of a shirt or shipping costs.
With the success he’s had so far, Antonio said he intends on giving back to his Baltimore hometown by hosting a shoe drive at his high school, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, in March and a coat drive during the upcoming summer.
Antonio said Étoile strives to represent the rawest form of individuality and to help people celebrate all the facets that make them who they are. 
“Being entirely you represents everything that encompasses a person,” Antonio said. “It’s the person who they are and not who they project. It’s the rawest form of you. It’s a true self. The you that you’d be if no one was watching as well as the you that you are because people are watching.”
