As a lover of all music — and yes, that includes country — I was really excited when I first heard Willow Smith’s pop-punk song, “Transparent Soul,” the other day. It’s not often you see young Black women in punk and rock genres … or is it? 
Nowadays in the music space, people associate rhythm and blues and rap genres as being the basis of Black music. But, in reality, they’re completely disregarding the impact Black musicians have made on music in its entirety. In many cases, people don’t even mention Black artists in genres like country and rock. So, in honor of Black Music Month, now’s a great time to talk about exactly why this is. 
Let’s start with one of my favorite examples, “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X. After the song was first released back in 2018, it debuted at number 19 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs and then was quickly relocated to the Hot Rap Songs chart. 
Though the song incorporated everything from a banjo-laced beat to lyrics about horses, boots and tractors, it just wasn’t country enough, as explained by a Billboard representative to Rolling Stone.
“While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version,” the representative said. 
While some thought race had played a role in it (see: tweet from Ski Mask The Slump God), it doesn’t seem far off, especially when so many Black artists are allocated to rap and R&B. It’s crazy to think that, in a genre paved by Black musicians, country music is so white-centric now that many blamed discrimination for “Old Town Road”‘s removal from the country charts. 
Country music was born from genres that Black people created, like religious hymns and blues. But in many cases, as country music gained popularity, Black people weren’t credited for songwriting or in musical covers, and white artists graced posters and album covers instead. And funnily enough, country stars like Hank Williams and Johnny Cash were mentored by Black musicians like Rufus “Tee Tot” Payne and Gustavus “Gus” Cannon. 
This pattern isn’t only true for country music either — it can also be seen in the rock and roll music realm. Black progenitors of the genre like Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Sister Rosetta Tharpe each made great strides in the creation of rock and roll. 
But, just like the aforementioned country artists, the white artists that were inspired by Black originators got significantly more recognition. Back in the 1950s, white pop singer Pat Boone covered three of Black rock and roll singer Little Richard’s songs, like “Tutti Frutti,” and was met with substantially higher levels of success. 
This, unfortunately, was extremely common across the music industry. When The Beach Boys recorded “Surfin’ U.S.A.,” it was note for note Chuck Berry’s “Sweet Little Sixteen” with new lyrics. While “Surfin’ U.S.A.” became an instant classic, Berry’s music isn’t currently as recognizable. Berry got songwriting credit for The Beach Boys hit but not before legal action was taken. 
Black artists have historically been cast out of the genres that they originated and popularized, so much so that country and rock are socially considered white. 
Fast forward about 70 years, Black artists are seeing a ton of success in the genres that worked so hard to erase them out of. Willow Smith’s “Transparent Soul,” the song that instantly piqued my interest in all of this, features blink-182’s Travis Barker and has ushered Smith into her new musical era of punk and rock music. 
Following in her mother’s footsteps as a rock artist — Jada Pinkett Smith was the lead singer of the nu-metal band “Wicked Wisdom” — Willow recognizes the discrimination that her mom faced in the rock music space and explains in an interview with W Magazine that she was still willing to give it a try. 
“A lot of people weren’t happy about seeing a Black woman in that space. I saw her [Jada Pinkett Smith] gracefully do her thing while so many people were being racist and sexist and just not being nice,” Smith said. “I never thought I could do rock music, because I was trained since I was 8 to sing R&B. Then I was just like, You know what? Eff it.”
With more Black country artists on the scene like Jimmie Allen, who was recently met with a standing ovation by Garth Brooks while honoring him at the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as Black rock artists like the Black woman fronted band Alabama Shakes, who’ve won multiple Grammys for rock and alternative music, it’s pretty safe to say that the future of these genres is in good hands. I look forward to the day where music better reflects its Black roots in history and Black artists aren’t left fighting for a rightful spot. So for now I simply say, it’s not “white people music.”

When Haoda “Harry” Wang read the email notifying him that he had been named a 2021 Goldwater Scholar, he immediately went back to bed, the accomplishment not settling in until a few hours later. Wang had been up late the night before working on his research internship with NASA.
Wang, a rising senior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, was one of two USC students named a 2021 Goldwater Scholar, receiving a $7,500 scholarship. The Goldwater Scholarship is aimed towards students intending to pursue a research career in the natural sciences, mathematics or engineering. Wang competed against over 5,000 college students at 438 academic institutions for the award.
Wang’s main research motivation, he said, is “building secure systems that are reliable.”
“It is really cool what you can do with a computer that you don’t really think about on a daily basis,” Wang said. “There’s so much that you could do with it to generate new scientific insights and data that never really was possible before. I’m working on really the foundation of what makes all this other stuff that we do possible.”
Wang initially entered USC unsure of what area of computer science he wanted to do. He knew he wanted to pursue computer science, a field Wang first found interest in at the age of seven. His dad, a physicist, once left a book lying around the house about basic programming. 
“I kind of got curious about it because there was nothing to read … It was just the only book in the house and I was completely bored so I was like, ‘I’ll take a look,’” Wang said. 
Since then, Wang’s research interests had continued to develop even after he enrolled at USC. During his freshman year, Wang became involved in computer science research at the USC Information Sciences Institute. His first research project involved abnormal attacks on code. 
According to Wang, computers can generally be attacked by overwhelming them with false, “garbage” data, whether or not the contents of the code are known. In his work, Wang helped develop a system to find elusive “packets” of data within large piles of “garbage data” that would “break everything” on server computers when received. Through this project, Wang discovered an interest in cybersecurity.
“[Wang] was at the level of experienced master’s students when he started in our lab, even though he was just a freshman,” said Jelena Mirkovic, research associate professor at ISI and Wang’s principal investigator. “He was immediately able to contribute to the first project he was in, and then I assigned him to the second project and wherever I put him, he was contributing and he was moving the project forward. I’ve been very impressed with his work ethic and his skills and his ability to be very proud in his interest and contribute to a number of projects.”
The summer after his freshman year, Wang worked at Sandia National Laboratories, a lab run by the Department of Energy, where he worked with high-performance computing and became interested in constructing secure and reliable computer systems, especially for emergency applications. 
Working with such high-quality technology led him back to the basics. According to Wang, foundational technology today, like random-access memory and central processing units, can be unreliable at times, or even untested. Vulnerabilities such as calculation errors and malfunctions can cause problems in emergencies.
“In a life-threatening situation, like you’re a firefighter and the phone or the satellite that you use to communicate with the other firefighters suddenly drops out, that’s a problem, and I thought it would be cool to work on this sort of problem,” Wang said. 
Wang worked for NASA full-time from January to August 2020, including with the Mars 2020 Rover for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, before beginning to work part-time until May. He created kinematics simulations, reproducing the flight software on the rover, discovered several critical bugs, and more. With the extra time he had after switching to part-time work, Wang took on some new projects at USC ISI that resembled reverse engineering, or determining the program’s function from its composition. 
“Most [projects] were involving binary analysis, where you take the compiled version of a program, and try and figure out what the program does from just the assembly code,” Wang said.
Another binary analysis project Wang worked on at ISI involved binary runtime code that were used in satellites, drones and other autonomous vehicles and translated into mathematical equations. 
“He’s been an invaluable asset to the team,” said ISI research computer scientist Luis Garcia, who worked with Wang on this project. “You would think he’s another graduate student, with the level of the skill set that he has and the level of maturity in terms of researching and so on.”
From mid-May to mid-August, Wang will be working on reconfigurable networking circuitry with a lab at Harvard University. His next plans are to apply for PhD programs and work on his undergraduate honors thesis about field programmable gate arrays. Not limiting himself to computer science, Wang looks toward electricity, where he plans to explore how field programmable gate arrays can be programmed to any kind of circuit desired.
“I don’t really limit myself to research questions that are in my field,” Wang said. “There’s a lot to be gained just by seeing something interesting or a weird correlation and trying to figure it out.”

In the days and weeks following the Atlanta shooting that killed eight women, six of whom were Asian American, May Lee noticed a stark difference in the media coverage of the event. The coverage, Lee said, by mainstream, predominantly white media outlets, versus that of Korean and other Asian outlets was “very different.” 
Lee, a journalist and adjunct professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said that mainstream outlets, unaware of cultural sensitivities and what Asian Americans were going through “skew[ed] the narrative,” dehumanized the victims through hypersexualization and “show[ed] more sympathy toward the shooter than the actual victims,” as in the case with the sheriff spokesman. On the other hand, Asian and Korean media outlets told a more complete and accurate story, Lee said, because of their awareness of cultural sensitivities.
While the Atlanta shootings are a recent example, Lee said media bias against Asian Americans has persisted throughout American history, citing the media’s pro-government stance during Japanese internment. With the knowledge of those biases in media and the anxiety and fear from the past year, in which hate crimes against Asians rose 114% in Los Angeles from 2019 to 2020 according to the Los Angeles Times, Lee pitched a class that would tackle these issues to Gordon Stables, the director of the School of Journalism. Over the course of just a couple of months, Stables fast-tracked the course, and Lee wrote the curriculum in a few weeks. The class, titled “Asian American History and Journalism,” will be open to students for the upcoming fall semester. 
The class “combines the idea of [Asian American and Pacific Islander] history and how journalism played a role in perpetuating stereotypes, misleading the public into thinking certain ways, covering stories in a very biased way just because of the area, and then also because of the lack of knowledge when it came to different Asian cultures in America,” Lee said. 
In addition to learning about AAPI history, a subject that many students have not been taught in schools, students will examine the ways in which coverage from AAPI outlets differ from mainstream outlets, the ways that media has historically misrepresented the AAPI community, cultural sensitivities and past AAPI social movements. The number one goal of the course, Lee said, is that “students will develop empathy.”
“Empathy is so powerful, but empathy only comes when you are better educated, better informed and more aware of a situation,” Lee said. “After [students] go through [this course] and learn a lot about AAPI history and how our stories and narratives have been skewed by the media, then I hope that there’s going to be a lot more empathy and understanding, and they’ll become much better journalists.”
Lee grew up in Dayton, Ohio in the 1970s and 80s as the only Asian kid in town aside from her older brother. She often felt like an outsider and less than, she said, and was exposed early on to the “idea of being a foreigner.” 
“Being Korean American, being Asian American was not something I was proud of or made to feel proud of,” Lee said. “I wanted to be white because that’s all I knew. I wanted to have blonde hair, I wanted to have blue eyes. I wanted to change my name to Mary because that sounded more white … Instead of being proud of [my identity], I was trying to dismiss it and push it away.”
Later on in Lee’s life, as she found her first journalism job and navigated her career, she experienced racism both while on the job and within the industry itself. She plans to use those experiences in the course, viewing sharing her own stories as a way to build empathy and hopes that students will be able to have open, and potentially painful or uncomfortable, conversations. 
“I hope that I will be able to create a class where people will really want to dig deep, and maybe also question themselves about our own biases, our own microaggressions, our own stereotypes that we’ve carried for a long time, not even aware of it,” Lee said.
The new course is being introduced now as journalism schools across the country are experiencing an evolving definition of what objectivity is in journalism, Stables said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
“Journalism schools are understanding that the core value of objectivity is providing high-quality information. It’s not trying to pretend that everyone comes from the same starting point,” Stables said. “So that subtle movement has meant a lot of our efforts and interventions [are] about saying, ‘How do you better report on a community that retains the truth-telling part of objectivity, without the false notion that everyone is the same?’”
Students will learn about the long historical discrimination against Asian Americans in the United States, including the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment, the Atlanta shootings and the murder of Vincent Chin, a Chinese American man who was beaten to death by two white men. In addition to learning about the history itself, students will examine the media coverage that followed the events, deconstructing how media bias against Asian Americans shaped public opinion. 
Nathan Hyun, a rising senior majoring in journalism and co-president of the USC chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association, said he often noticed that he is one of few Asian Americans, especially Asian American men, in the Annenberg School — and the media industry as a whole. Because of that awareness, Hyun said he is excited by the new course and other steps that Annenberg has recently taken to address anti-Asian racism. 
“I definitely think it was an area, a topic, that Annenberg lacked, even the last couple years. But I’m really encouraged, and I’m really excited to see what more the University and what Annenberg can do moving forward,” Hyun said. 
At other points in history, Lee said there have been “little waves” of focus on Asian American issues. Now, she hopes the movement will last. 
“This time the whole idea of the model minority myth is just being shattered, and a lot of Asians, especially younger Asians are saying ‘No, we’re not the model minority, we’re not going to stay silent. We’re going to speak up, speak out and really engage and become very much like the activist movement,’” Lee said. “That’s why I’m very hopeful that the changes will continue.”

Originally from Honolulu, Hawaii, Bryson Choy enjoyed history and economics in high school, but his interests shifted to drug discovery and quantitative biology when he enrolled at USC three years ago. After pursuing research during his freshman year, Choy was one of two USC students to receive the Barry Goldwater Scholarship in March. Out of 1,200 applicants who received nominations from their school, 410 students received the $7,500 award for their works.
Choy, a rising senior studying quantitative biology and pursuing a progressive degree in quantitative and computational biology, had family members who had a history of chronic diseases. He wanted to understand how different treatments worked and was interested in learning how research could better address how diseases are treated with different therapies.
“[The award] is really a manifestation of the work that you did in your undergraduate research,” Choy said. “It’s a good stepping stone for future research fellowships that you might apply to for graduate school.” 
Beginning freshman year, Choy talked to his professor, Remo Rohs, professor of quantitative and computational biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy and computer science, about his interests in computational tools to better understand disease and advance the understanding of diseases. Rohs directed Choy to various labs, including the Katritch Lab, where he would begin research during his second semester.
“That was my very first experience [performing research], I had no previous exposure to research, but that’s when I really began to get engaged in different projects,” Choy said. “My interest in research began to build … but the prospect of discovering new things, of making new discoveries and being able to advance your knowledge of, for example, a specific disease or a specific protein and how it works, was really enticing.”
Choy has continued working at the Katritch Lab and is currently writing a manuscript based on his discoveries, after which he will continue working on another project related to the discovery of another selective small molecule. While first beginning at the Katritch Lab, Choy was mentored by Arman Sadybekov, took on a few pilot projects and started to work on an independent project, which included modeling and analyzing the functional role of sodium ions in receptors and how the ion impacts activation and various functions. 
Vsevolod Katritch, associate professor of quantitative and computational biology and chemistry, said that it was unusual for a freshman to be interested in his lab. However, Choy’s interests and enrollment in the second cohort of the quantitative biology major, which was created in 2017, matched what they were doing in his lab, so Katritch decided to make an exception to take Choy into his lab.
“I never regretted about [taking] him because he actually is a fast learner, and he quickly learned the ropes,” Katritch said.
In addition to working with Katritch, Choy also began research with William Padula, assistant professor of pharmaceutical and health economics in the School of Pharmacy. After onboarding onto Padula’s research team, Choy completed tasks that required data analysis, computer programming, systematic literature review and identified important data points to build the lab’s research.
Padula said that it takes a certain type of person to dedicate themselves to such research initiatives, as it takes a lot of work and time before one can get their work published in a journal.  
“Bryson showed me that he was very patient, [was thinking] analytically and was learning the right methodology to contribute to the type of work that we were doing in my lab, so I could tell right away that he was a good fit,” Padula said.
As Choy continued his research, he heard about the Goldwater Scholarship — an award for students interested in doing STEM field research as a future career — from another student from Hawaii who had previously received the scholarship. In his scholarship application, Choy wrote about his interest in drug discovery and discussed his contributions to the Katritch Lab regarding the role of sodium in the activation of GPCRs, or receptors that allow molecules to bind to it, and how this can better inform future drug design approaches.
“His accomplishments and what he’s doing [is] a challenging problem, and how he approached it is very competitive for the highest level.” Katritch said. “I was not surprised that he was chosen.” 
Padula called Choy an “up and coming star.” Choy seemed to be very altruistic, with a desire to do research to help people and to improve social services, Padula said.
“He wants to be a researcher in the field of social services, whether that’s healthcare and public health or whether that’s somewhere else is really up to him at this point, but … he has the right training and quantitative methods and this blend of computer science and programming to be able to make it a reality,” Padula said.
This summer, Choy is conducting research under Mitch Guttman, a professor in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering at Caltech. Following the completion of his progressive degree program next year, Choy hopes to apply to doctorate programs in computational biology. He said that being a Goldwater Scholar will not only help him pay for tuition, but connect him to a valuable network.
“I think the opportunity to connect to others, like Goldwater Scholars, and being able to talk and connect to other students who are also interested in the same research as you, or just research in general, gives you a community of students that are also interested in going to graduate school pursuing research as a career,” Choy said. “I think that in itself is really valuable.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Remo Rohs as a professor of quantitative and computational biology, chemistry, physics and anatomy, instead of a professor of quantitative and computational biology, chemistry, physics and astronomy. It also didn’t include his position as a professor of computer science. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In a windowless room on South Grand Avenue, dozens of phone lines came abuzz every night as student workers chatted up USC alumni, hoping to get a donation by the end of each call. 
This off-campus facility was home to “SCallers,” a cohort of student workers who raised money for USC through phone conversations with alumni. They called former Trojans and shared news of facility upgrades, new programs for research and positive personal anecdotes about USC, aiming to convince clients to open up their purses to their alma mater. SCallers followed a script that asked them to “smile while you dial,” and required they ask each client four separate times for money before hanging up. This number was later lowered to three on account of a recent spate of University scandals, said Alice Thomas, a former USC student and supervisor. 
The call center closed in May 2020 after a few scandals of its own, including a controversy over employees’ paid sick leave and a bathroom break policy that penalized workers who used the restroom for too long. But in reflecting on the history of SCallers, some former employees also value the friendships and skills that emerged from their work experience amid these drawbacks. The Daily Trojan interviewed seven former employees who worked at the call center between 2015 and 2020.
“I think getting people to part with their hard earned money is definitely hard to do, especially when you’re embroiled in so many scandals. There were plenty of moments when people were pissed off that you were calling asking for money, but I feel like the positive interactions outweighed those.”
Despite the monotonous nature of scripted phone calls, Ward looked forward to work. He fondly remembers building rapport with clients and developing the courage to make multiple requests during his time at the call center. The job was a fun challenge to his persuasive skills.
“My favorites were the people who answered the phone saying ‘I’m not going to give any money today,’” Ward said. “Then they would give money by the time we got off the phone.” 
Ward made connections not only with donors but also with his co-workers. He met supervisors Mariah Breit and Thomas while working in the call center, and the three enjoyed lasting friendships with their fellow SCallers, many of whom were USC students. The managers would sometimes order pizza for the SCallers, organize Christmas gift exchanges and facilitate team-building activities. 
“The fun part was the conversations that we had amongst each other,” Ward said. “Being able to build friendships, leaving there, and then going to hang out afterwards. A lot of my good friends now — I met them there.”
But on the phone lines, the conversations were sometimes less friendly, Thomas said.
“You get a lot of rude people, a lot of upset people, a lot of racist people sometimes,” she said.
Thomas recalled one Chinese American SCaller who quit after her first week because a client complained that there were too many Asian students attending the University compared to when he had graduated.
“I was very, very surprised that, even at that time, USC wanted to continue with the call center,” said a former manager, who asked to remain anonymous in the interest of job security. “I think it actually took a toll on the students themselves because we can train them on how to combat or rebut … the complaints. But, still, that’s a lot of emotional and mental abuse they all have to deal with.”
The former manager — though not a USC student — was part of a staff hired by Ruffalo Noel Levitz, an institutional fundraising contractor that oversees call centers at more than 1,900 universities and non-profit organizations around the world. USC’s call center was one of the biggest money-makers for RNL, she said.
But for years the money raised for USC by RNL belied an opaque management style which penalized SCallers for bathroom breaks and misled them about their right to paid sick leave, Thomas said.
Thomas began working at USC’s call center in 2015, where she described a strict workplace rule under which only one employee was permitted to use the restroom at any given time. SCallers were also prohibited from using the restroom during their first and last 30 minutes of shift, she said.
“Turns out, it is illegal to tell someone that they can’t go to the bathroom,” she said.
One employee defied this rule and was told by the manager on duty to sit back down in her seat, an incident which escalated as the employee threw punches and threw a water bottle at her superior. She then knocked over several computers and fled the scene, Thomas said.
California Labor Code states that employees are entitled to a “reasonable” amount of bathroom breaks of “reasonable” duration. Though the definition of a reasonable restroom break can vary between workplaces, employers are prohibited from limiting restroom breaks to certain times during an employee’s shift, according to the law.  
Jenna Hanson, another RNL employee, took over as the call center director in May 2016 following this incident. Hanson presided over a new policy, which entailed a seven minute limit on restroom breaks, after which employees would have their pay docked for a 15 minute portion of their shift.
“We had to time how long people were in the bathroom. The supervisors were all USC students, so we didn’t enforce it super strictly.”
A former call center manager confirmed that she and her RNL colleagues told Breit and other student supervisors to enforce limits on SCallers’ bathroom breaks. 
“I know a few people who got fired for using the bathroom too many times,” Thomas said. “But, on official paperwork, it says it’s because they were inefficient or they weren’t dialing for as many hours as they should have. But it’s because they were in the bathroom.”
One of these employees was Gabbi Soong, who worked at the call center for a few months in 2019 before graduating from USC in 2021. Breit and other supervisors reprimanded Soong for lengthy restroom breaks despite co-workers vouching for her presence at her desk, she said. 
“Supervisors would come up to my desk and say, ‘Hey, you were in the bathroom for way too long,’” Soong said. “And I would say, ‘I was sitting here. I wasn’t in the bathroom.’”
Soong was written up twice for these alleged bathroom breaks, the second of which led to her termination. Three write-ups are grounds for dismissal from the call center; Soong had accrued one additional write-up unrelated to bathroom breaks. She was not informed of the final write-up until a manager called her into a meeting to fire her, Soong said. 
Official RNL paperwork obtained by the Daily Trojan cited “constant interruptions with calling,” as the reason for Soong’s dismissal. These interruptions constituted a “violation of department work rule,” according to a termination document provided by Soong. 
At the time of her dismissal, Soong did not know that she was entitled to paid sick leave. 
When asked about sick hours, Hanson initially told SCallers they did not receive sick hours because they were part-time workers, Breit said. After hearing this, Thomas and Breit said they became suspicious of the policy because many of them received paid sick leave at previous or concurrent jobs.
According to California Labor Law section 246, employers must provide employees with written notice that sets forth the amount of paid sick leave available to them. 
Upon further investigation, Thomas found she had accrued 90 hours of sick time in her four years working at SCallers. A typical call center employee worked for 10 hours every week. These hours did not appear on her pay stubs, Thomas said. 
The two supervisors met with Hanson again, who told Breit and Thomas that she knew little about the call center’s official sick leave policy. Hanson promised to resolve the issue but told the supervisors not to mention paid sick leave to the other SCallers until she made a decision, Breit said. 
“I literally had a sleepless night over it,” Thomas said. “I was super anxious because I had been totally manipulated.” 
Breit and Thomas decided to tell their co-workers anyway. 
Hanson noted to employees that sick leave policies were outlined in a nondescript labor rights flyer posted on the back wall of the call center. If SCallers wanted to be paid for their sick hours, they had to contact RNL management to claim them. 
“Hours missed due to being sick should still be made up,” Hanson wrote in an email to the SCallers. 
Shifts missed due to illness had to be completed within a week and within the same calendar month and failure to do so would merit a write-up, according to Hanson’s email. This policy constitutes disciplinary action against employees for using sick leave, a practice prohibited by California Labor Law Section 246. 
“I was like, ‘That still does not seem right,’” Breit said. “If someone can only work 10 hours a week, and they’re sick, that’s really not their fault.”
The Daily Trojan reached out to Hanson on three separate occasions to make clear the allegations that she had misled call center employees about sick hours. She declined to comment for the story.
The call center amended its sick leave policy in April 2020 in response to months of employee pushback. However, RNL Vice President of Client Success Brian Cass maintained that the policy of asking employees to make up their sick leave was an “acceptable practice,” according to an email obtained by the Daily Trojan that he sent to a student worker. 
“I’m sorry you were not aware that as an employee in California you accrued sick time,” Cass wrote in the email. “[I] encourage you to take advantage of this moving forward when you aren’t feeling well.”
As of April 20, 2020, employees utilizing sick hours were no longer required to make up shifts, according to Cass’ email. But there were few opportunities to redeem sick hours after this clarification — the call center officially closed less than a month later.
Cass, who is no longer employed at RNL, declined to comment on how he managed the controversy over paid leave for SCallers.
The paid leave controversies stoked distrust between management and students, Thomas said.
“At the end of the day, what they cared about more than anything was their bottom line and how much money we were making. If we were able to call out sick, that would really affect their numbers, because we wouldn’t have to come in and make that time up.”
When the pandemic hit, sick hours were not the only concern on the SCallers’ minds. At the time, Breit worked a second job at the Troy Hall customer service center, where she received paid administrative leave from the University through May 13 according to her regularly scheduled hours.
But for the SCallers it was a different story. Since RNL managed the call center, its employees were not subject to USC’s paid leave policy for student workers. Hanson asked employees to continue working remotely in an email to the SCallers. Their new task: design a marketing plan for the University and record a video including a personal account of the value of a USC education. 
Breit was frustrated with the request to create promotional marketing plans for USC while she struggled to adjust to remote learning from her home in Wisconsin, she said. 
“It was a lot of work for $15 an hour, especially when she said that she needed it in a week or two,” Breit said. “One of the other students said, ‘This is a job that you could get paid $60,000 [annually] for.’ And so we said, ‘Unless you guys are giving us a raise, we’re not doing this.’”
The SCallers began to receive paid administrative leave April 9, according to an email from Hanson to the staff. Their pay stopped coming in the week of May 13, when the call center officially closed.
As of May 13, 2020, RNL no longer manages USC’s call center, according to an email sent by Cass to the SCallers. When reached for comment about the SCallers, RNL Vice President of Content and Marketing Brandon Trissler did not address the controversy surrounding paid leave or bathroom breaks. 
“RNL values our partnership with USC,” he said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “While we do provide the RNL Engage fundraising platform that USC uses for phone channel outreach, we do not employ or manage the USC student call center staff.”
In the future, USC will manage its own call center, according to a University statement. It remains unclear when this call center will begin hiring.
In the statement, USC recognized the SCallers for their work but did not clarify why the call center had closed.
“Student outreach to alumni and donors plays an important role in annual giving because it provides a great personal connection with current students and alumni,” the statement said.
Despite this personal connection, some former student workers still feel undervalued. Ward noted that the lasting friendships he made with his co-workers far outweighed the unpleasant talks with alumni and management. However, the closure of the call center still left a bad taste in his mouth, he said. 
“It was a real reality check about how corporations view employees, even if they foster this sense of community like we’re a team.” Ward said. 
Thomas echoed this sentiment in regard to her stint as a student worker. She said many of her fellow employees were new to the workforce and unsure of how to advocate for themselves.
“I think that it’s really easy to manipulate college students and people who haven’t worked before,” she said. “We didn’t really know what we were entitled to. And we constantly were being told that we could be replaced. So there was a real culture of fear and intimidation.”
As a recent Class of 2021 graduate, Thomas is grateful for the lessons she learned at the call center, she said. After five years of working the phone lines, she remains hopeful for future SCallers who will take her place.
“We were college students; we just wanted to make a buck so we could go out on the weekends,” Thomas said. “I hope that if USC does decide to open up their [own] call center, they’ll make it a lot better for students.”

Is anyone else worried about the sport of boxing? Was Sunday’s joke of a “prize fight” enough to help fans realize how far the sport has fallen?
I find it hard to believe the best fights boxing has to offer involve an out-of-shape Roy Jones Jr. and Mike Tyson sweating on each other for half an hour or the Paul brothers claiming superiority by repeatedly defeating non-boxers. 
So what’s wrong with the sport that once captivated entire neighborhoods for multiple Saturday evenings every year? Well, a lot. 
Top fighters avoid challenging fights in an attempt to protect meaningless, “undefeated” records. There are so many title belts it feels like every weight class has 15 so-called “champions,” and there are so many weight classes it seems almost impossible for boxing to find its next pound-for-pound star. 
Since Floyd Mayweather Jr. left the sport in 2017, boxing’s biggest headlines have involved the Paul brothers, a 54-year-old Tyson and Mayweather Jr. himself. The sport has declined in popularity for nearly two decades now, but the showmanship of Oscar De La Hoya and Mayweather Jr. throughout the 2000’s and early 2010’s papered over cracks, helping boxing cling to its last bit of relevance. 
Since Mayweather Jr.’s retirement, Dana White and the UFC asserted themselves as the dominant force in combat sports, taking the title that belonged to boxing throughout the 20th century. 
In the UFC, there are eight weight classes for men and four for women, split by 10 to 15 pounds with one champion at each level. Pretty simple, right? 
In the ever-confusing sport of boxing, there are 18 weight classes, split by 5 to 7 pounds each. Fighters created arbitrary “catch weights” to sanction fights across weight divisions in the past, despite such a rigid weight class structure. 
If the classes are enforced loosely, what’s the point of having so many in the first place? 
With the abundance of weight classes in boxing, there are fewer “top” fighters at each weight level, making it harder to create intriguing fights. When there are multiple popular and talented fighters in one weight class, they rarely fight each other when they should. 
The world had to wait over a decade to see Manny Pacquiao get a shot at Mayweather Jr., and even that fight underwhelmed as both fighters were well past their prime.
Similar situations happen right now, as two of the sport’s biggest stars in welterweight champions Errol Spence Jr. and Terrence Crawford have deprived the public of the sport’s most highly-anticipated fight for nearly three years. The reason is likely a combination of promoter politics and hesitance from both Crawford and Spence Jr. 
Both fighters likely see themselves as the top fighter in the welterweight division. Instead of fighting each other to find out, as things would have played out in boxing’s prime years, both Crawford and Spence Jr. have settled into comfortable routines of fighting two opponents they know they can beat every year and collecting their respective pair of checks. 
This mentality is exactly what’s ruining the sport, and it will likely be what buries it. Excessive weight classes and an absurd number of belts allow more fighters than ever to claim “champion” status without facing any real challenges along the way. 
Instead, these fighters are choosing to adopt the “Mayweather Jr.-model” with increased frequency. The “Mayweather Jr.- model” is a term I use to describe fighters who turn down fights that could potentially vault their career because they don’t want to risk losing. In this case, Crawford and Spence Jr. are obsessing over protecting their “undefeated” status in fear that a loss would somehow derail their careers.  
As a boxing fan myself, I still can’t wrap my head around their way of thinking. Almost every legend in the history of boxing lost at least one fight. 
Muhammad Ali lost multiple times. So did Julio Cesar Chavez Sr., Marvin Hagler and Joe Frazier. Extremely talented and highly-marketable fighters, like Crawford and Spence Jr., miss out on incredible opportunities to advance their careers because of the recency bias that favors Mayweather Jr.
If Crawford and Spence Jr. fight and the product is at least somewhat entertaining, they can probably run it back for a rematch, regardless of the outcome. If the rematch is decent, there will probably be substantial demand for a third fight between the two. 
Not only will everyone involved with the fight line their pockets with prize money, but the fighters popularity will skyrocket from the magnitude of being in a major pay-per-view title fight. Stars are made in big-time matchups, not by winning 40 consecutive fights against part-time dental assistants. And don’t get me started on the belts.
There are seven different fighters that technically hold at least one belt in the welterweight division right now. Seriously. There’s the World Boxing Organization champion. Then the World Boxing Council, International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association champions. I forgot to mention the interim, regular and “franchise” champions too. Bored yet? 
Between the meaningless belts and celebrity cameos, boxing has looked more like the WWE than an actual sport in recent years.
Boxing’s most marketable fights — the ones that would pack every neighbor into your living room on a Saturday night — are not happening anymore. The longer boxing promoters rely on gimmicks to sustain relevance, the harder it will be for the sport to return to the interest and respect levels of the NFL, NBA and, now, the UFC in the eyes of the American public. 
Regulating organizations need to take a page out of the UFC’s playbook: Condense weight classes and unify belts to increase the level of competition and create meaningful fights. When true “prize fights” are back on the table, fighters need to look a little further back into history and realize one loss won’t end their career. 
Once fighters are more willing to take on a challenge, weight classes can be condensed and belts can be unified. Or vice versa, perhaps. With just one belt to fight for in fewer weight classes, the path to becoming a champion would become a lot clearer and boxers would be forced to take on the best competition.
Or we can keep watching YouTubers and retired boxers take the ring as boxing fades into oblivion. The choice is theirs, I guess.

After a top-three Pac-12 finish, men’s and women’s track & field took to the track at E.B. Cushing Stadium in Texas for the 2021 NCAA West Preliminary Rounds. The top three finishers in each event, plus the three next best times, would move on to the 2021 NCAA Track & Field Championships.
USC had 15 women and 14 men advance to compete for the national championship in a variety of events, with multiple records and personal records set.
Senior sprinter Twanisha “TeeTee” Terry added on to her spectacular season, setting a women’s Pac-12 100m record (10.89 seconds) and Cushing Stadium record in the 100-meter and 200-meter dash. Her 200-meter dash time of 20.54 seconds is also her new PR. 
Outside of Terry, freshman jumper Temi Ojora improved her PR and USC freshman record in the women’s triple jump competition. Her jump of 44 feet and 8.25 inches or 13.62 meters also improved her third-place position on USC’s all-time list. 
The laundry list of athletes alongside Terry and Ojora to qualify for the championships began with the men’s 4×100-meter relay team. Davonte Burnett, Brendan Stewart, Kenan Christon and Eric Allen Jr. put together a season-best time of 39.20 seconds to be the first Trojans to qualify. The men and women’s 4×400-meter relay team qualified as well.
USC will have representation outside of relay teams. They had five 400-meter women move on to the Championships. Senior sprinter Kaelin Roberts and junior sprinter Bailey Lear outperformed themselves with PRs. Redshirt senior and All-American sprinter Kyra Constantine, redshirt senior Nicole Yeargin and freshman Kimberly Harris were among the other Trojans to advance with impressive times.
Some of the USC men and women athletes to qualify in individual events include Davonte Burnett (100-meter, 200-meter),  Angie Annelus (200-meter), Breanna Bernard-Joseph(400-meter Hurdles), Anna Cockrell (100-meter Hurdles, 400-meter Hurdles), Brian Herron (400-meter), Isaiah Jewett (800-meter), Tade Ojora (110-meter Hurdles), Cameron Samuel (400-meter Hurdles),  Lanae-Tava Thomas (100-meter, 200-meter) and Nicole Yeargin (400-meter). 
The Track & Field Championships will be held June 9-12 at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore.

In his show, “AJ And The Queen” — which he directs and stars in — RuPaul plays the role of Robert, a luckless drag queen (Ruby Red) who is robbed by her boyfriend, preventing her from opening up her own drag club as she’d hoped.
As Robert heads out on a road trip for a cross country tour, he is accompanied by AJ, a 10-year-old who tags along in hopes of making some extra cash by swindling adults into giving her money.

Throughout the 11 season series, audiences get to follow Mitch and Cam as they experience milestones from adopting a child to getting married. It’s an amazing, unforgettable journey that everyone should watch.

Angelo and Stephen Sherock, Republicans who identify as gay. They express their reasoning as to why they are affiliated with a political party that has historically been discriminatory towards the LGBTQ+ community. If you are interested in seeing how the lives of the LGBTQ+ community are affected by politics and political leaders, this is the perfect show for you.

Just breathe. Another musical is coming to the big screen.
Movie adaptations of famous Broadway musicals are increasingly becoming the norm. It’s hard to believe that we are getting at least three of them this year, starting with the Tony Award-winning musical “In the Heights.” 
In it, Lin-Manuel Miranda returns with another one of his beloved musicals, following the surprise proshot of “Hamilton” that was released on Disney Plus only last July. The latest installment in musical-to-movie adaptations over the years, “In the Heights,” directed by Jon M. Chu, nearly perfects what it means to be one in this day and age. Actors and creators from the film shared their thoughts at a college roundtable interview May 24.
Despite making some changes that die-hard fans would definitely notice, the movie nevertheless stays true to the authenticity of the original musical. The plot centers on characters doing what they can to achieve their own personal measures of success within their community of Washington Heights in New York City. 
From the very beginning, the movie introduces us to the overarching concept of the Spanish word sueñito, or little dream, which was a theme heavily implied through the characters in the original musical. Despite being a verbal theme unique to the movie, the idea of sueñito gives audiences clarity to better understand the motives of the characters. 
“I think it’s in our blood as children of immigrants,” said Melissa Barrera, who plays Vanessa in the film adaptation. “It’s ingrained in us that we’re ‘dreamers,’ in the broad sense of the word. Every person in the ensemble of the movie has different dreams … but every single dream is as important as the next.”
Theatre-goers may also be skeptical at first of certain decisions made in regards to what made the final cut to the big screen.
These decisions include the removal of Nina’s (Leslie Grace) mother Camila’s storyline from the Rosario family picture, along with fan-favorite songs like Benny (Corey Hawkins) and Nina’s love duet “Sunrise” and Abuela Claudia’s (Olga Merediz) tear-jerking “Hundreds of Stories.”
“‘In the Heights’ has always been a tapestry,” said Quiara Alegría Hudes, writer of the musical’s book. “To me, the lead character is the community … When we moved from the stage play to the screenplay, we knew we would have to eliminate some elements to [give] the ones that remain in the tapestry … room to breathe on screen.”
But, despite the changes, Merediz’s reprisal of her Tony-nominated performance as Abuela Claudia allows audiences to feel as if they were watching the original production.
“Reprising the role in the movie, I definitely [was] very hard on myself,” said Merediz. “I felt like I had to, again, … get it from the depths of my soul and be true to this character.”
And with stage-to-film changes, comes stage-to-film enhancements. 
Plays and musicals already utilize clever maneuvering of special effects to bring stories to life on stage. Film productions embrace that same creative freedom through the magic of editing. 
“There were so many technical parts and moving pieces that we weren’t even aware of,” Grace said. “I can’t even imagine all the things that the film crew had to do to make sure that we got this illusion. It’s … magical.”
And director Chu uses this aspect to his advantage to further evoke the cultural vibrance of the Latinx community for “In the Heights.”
“I think he was the person that was supposed to direct this film,” said Jimmy Smits, who plays Kevin Rosario in the upcoming film adaptation. “He [does] these beautiful scenes for ‘Paciencia y Fe’ and ‘96,000’ that are odes to old Hollywood, but at the same time, very current.”
It’s without a doubt that the film adaptation’s release could not come at a more vital time.
“Coming through this pandemic and having to reckon with not only health issues, but a lot of social issues, whether it’s LGBTQ+, immigration or BLM, it’s all of these things that have made us more in tune,” Smits said.
With the increased awareness in social-political movements in the past year, “In the Heights” brilliantly focuses on and lifts up the voices of the Latinx community by placing audiences in intimate settings that are representative of their cultural experiences.
“It’s part of our culture to have intimate moments [in the] salon … because it’s a therapy session,” said Dascha Polanco, who plays Cuca in the film. “It’s a moment for us to not only beautify but express ourselves in a safe place, for us to feel at home and belong. And so, playing the roles of women that own [this] business represents women that raised us within our community, as well.”
Considering the cultural impacts that “In the Heights” made as a stage musical and will make as a film adaptation, audiences can be assured this is only the beginning for the necessary and more authentic representation of the Latinx and minority communities in the future of film.
“[‘In the Heights’] goes to show this can work,” Polanco said. “These stories do work and there’s a yearn for it … Now, the question is ‘what’s next’ and who’s willing to take that risk and leap forward.”
“In the Heights” comes out in theaters and will be available for streaming on HBO Max on June 11.

Content warning: This article contains information regarding death and suicide. Students dealing with mental health concerns can walk into USC Student Health centers or contact the 24/7 phone line (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance. 
Bo Burnham’s new special, “Bo Burnham: Inside” is unsettling, candid, ironic, sincere, hectic and awe-inspiring in a way that both illuminates Burnham’s incredible performance abilities and casts a shadow over what appears to be a dark, depressive state of loneliness scratching at Burnham’s mind. 
It’s a twist on the one man show, a solo Tiny Desk performance-esque comedy special. One that utilizes its title to point fingers at both the harrowing isolation that the coronavirus pandemic has brought to the world and the personal withdrawal into Burnham’s own mind. “Inside” is a wonderfully tender, comedic and sobering look into mental health and the loneliness that comes with the pandemic. It reminds audiences that it’s okay to feel isolated, but that they should always continue pushing forward. 
In that way, “Inside” is a true masterpiece: It pushes the primary idea that, even through the suffering of loneliness, consistently trying to live is the best you can do.
Burnham’s special is just as chaotic as one would expect from a comedian locked inside for more than a year, jumping from discussions about FaceTime calls with his mother to parodies of Twitch streamers and sardonic reactions to Jeff Bezos’ business practices. 
A common theme that finds itself replicated throughout the special, however, is the overarching suicidal feelings Burnham struggles with, both in his understanding of his own loneliness and his relationship to the concept of suicide itself. Burnham constantly mentions death, both as an overly personal moment and an apocalyptic, end-of-world concept. He discusses suicide by gun with a candor that demands the audience’s attention. Further, the death of a mother makes an entirely unexpected appearance in a bit about white women. This obsession with death culminates halfway through the special, where he sits solemnly in the dark, alone, a projection of himself as the only source of light on his body. He gives advice to an alternate version of himself, one that’s been stuck in quarantine for a longer period of time, but this version of him acts as a stand-in for the audience; Burnham is talking directly to the viewer when he’s discussing death. 
It’s dark, but, more importantly, it has a sliver of hope to it; not once does Burnham ever end a joke about suicide without ever qualifying it within the context of the joke or outright telling the camera (and as such, the audience) to “Just, don’t” in reference to suicide. It never becomes too depressing without swinging back to the empathetic — pushing audience members to not wallow in their own depression (ironically, in a setting almost completely defined by Burnham wallowing in his own sadness). The special revolves around the vulnerability Burnham opens himself up to through to an audience that isn’t there, for a viewing party that will never see “Inside” in person and yet, never strays into darkness too much. He notes in the song “Turning 30” that by “2030, I’ll be 40 and kill myself then” but almost immediately backtracks on the depressing sentiment. 
There’s something to be said about that: a focus on the positive even through a noticeably more depressing, chaotic and shut-in special than his grandiose “Make Happy” and his wonderfully well-put-together “what”. 
It’s a special born out of the coronavirus, and, yet, Burnham chooses not to dwell on the upsetting circumstances for too long. Although “Inside” doesn’t shy away from thinking about existential crises, it doesn’t specifically dwell on these problems excessively; the special only takes the time to look back at the pandemic to contextualize his thoughts on death.  
Indeed, “Inside,” for all of its distressing material covered and the disheartening situations Burnham finds himself in, ends with Burnham watching a recording of himself, with the final few frames being a shot of him beginning to genuinely smile. It’s an uplifting shot, one that drives home the central theme of “Inside:” Through all the isolation and the pain that naturally comes with, there’s always a better ending to work towards.

The tidbit of advice that I will be discussing today really takes a jab at the heart. In tradition with the gerontology column, all of the quotes that we dissect come from interviews and casual discussion posts with individuals who are in the field of aging, are older adults themselves, or both. 
“If I could have one more minute with my mother, I would do anything. Every older person has someone that loves them and wants them here, and that’s what inspires me.”
The process of aging is one filled with love and loss, which both often intertwine with one another. The creation or maintenance of new relationships can often be met with them ending or falling through. However, the memories of those journeys are what many consider life to be all about. College students often experience a lot of love and loss in terms of relationships, with dating and friendships built upon convenience; however, the nature of the pandemic, as you have probably guessed, has made things a whole lot more complicated. Love has become more complicated with relationships in the virtual space straining emotions and mental health. 
We have all experienced a great deal of loss in our life, whether it be losing a family member, falling out with someone you considered a close friend, or breaking up with someone you had thought to be the one. Loss is an incredibly difficult part of life that surrounds us each and every day. But as the saying goes, love finds a way. To avoid sounding like a pastor at Sunday sermons, I hope that you, too, can appreciate and cherish the memories that come prior to loss. Often, while it does stab and tear the heart apart, loss simultaneously puts life into a new perspective, one that often suggests making a change and living life in a new way that honors yourself or the one you lost. For me, losing my grandparents in a very short frame of time at a young age acted as a driving force to help me pursue gerontology in an effort to reconnect and create new memories with the older generation. A breakup, similarly, can teach us that maybe dating is just not our thing yet or that we still need to figure out what we really want in a relationship. 
Many of us will begin the transition back to campus or even move out for the first time. For some, the notion of independence and liberation from nagging parents or siblings can be a weight lifted off your shoulders. The world can present an incredibly exciting adventure, jumpstarted by the promises of the college experience. And, if we are honest with ourselves, college is a less serious, more fun version of the real world all around us. 
But often, leaving our families can be an incredibly arduous and emotionally draining process, especially for those who may be experiencing it for the first time. Again, independence always coincides with some form of loss, certainly, but it also provides new opportunities for love to grow. It is crucial to take some time for yourself and those loved ones around you, maybe taking that one minute or two with those who you may leave behind as you head off to college.
