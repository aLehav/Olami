The USC Alumni Association redistributed its regional and staff resources over the summer to provide three program types with the goal of improving alumni engagement. 
The “Trojan Traditions” represents longstanding events such as the Summer SCendoff and Football Game Watch Parties while the “Trojan Exemplars” will offer professional and career opportunities through industry expert panels as well as the “Trojan Network,” USC’s online alumni networking and mentoring platform. “Trojan Locals” will consist of social events in localized areas, such as USC Night at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.
This new model of alumni engagement, launched July 1, established regional advisory groups in San Diego, Orange County,  Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York and dismantled the previous alumni club leadership structure. According to a Q&A recap of a June 3 Town Hall meeting discussing the changes, the association said the new structure is a “program-based and user-friendly strategy.”
Previously, the regional alumni club leaders were in charge of organizing local events, such as football watch parties and coffeehouse meet-ups. With the new changes, the regional leadership boards were disbanded, and alumni volunteers will need to submit an event for approval by their regional staff liaison.
 The USCAA said in an email that the decision to disband the regional leadership structure allows any alumnus to organize alumni events, creating a more flexible and inclusive approach to engagement. The group believes the new structure is an improvement upon how the alumni network was previously organized. 
Sam Dorn, former president of the Washington D.C. Alumni Club, expressed his discontent with the changes and lack of transparency involved with the development process.
“The reason we are upset is that these changes were implemented unilaterally,” Dorn said. “They didn’t consult with any on-the-ground alumni leaders, which is a management and organizational flaw.”
Despite widespread frustration over the changes, Dorn said alumni across the country want to continue working with USC to maintain the strong network. More than 70 alumni club leaders from New York to Phoenix sent a letter to President Carol Folt July 6 that detailed their disappointment with the new model of alumni engagement and called for a hybridization of the previous alumni clubs with newly established regional advisory groups.
“We believe that the USCAA did not carefully consider the perspective, morale, and positive
contributions to the Trojan Family of those who participate in regional alumni groups,” the letter read. “They also grossly underestimated the breadth and intensity of alumni opposition to dissolving the regional alumni groups.”
According to the letter, the decision to dissolve all domestic alumni clubs contradicted the USCAA’s mission to provide “lifelong and worldwide” connections to the Trojan Family and disregarded the efforts of current alumni leaders.
The USCAA said it had engaged in conversations with the Board of Trustees Alumni Affairs Committee, the Board of Governors and alumni throughout the country since 2017 before introducing the new model. These discussions along with alumni attitude survey responses showed that alumni wanted to engage in event development and organization.
“It became apparent that a new approach was needed — one that would empower more regional volunteers and expand involvement opportunities for all,” the USCAA wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
Despite these discussions, Dorn said communication with alumni after the changes were implemented was sparse. Some alumni received no responses to individual emails sent to the USCAA while others received general responses or limited personal responses to their outreach. However, one alum was able to coordinate a discussion with Patrick Auerbach, associate senior vice president for alumni affairs, that led to a virtual conversation on Aug. 11 between alumni and the USCAA.
In the virtual meeting, nine USC alumni joined with the USCAA to discuss the recently restructured alumni engagement model. The goal of the meeting was to collaboratively address alumni concerns over the structural overhaul and to improve communication efforts between alumni and the USCAA.
The decision to only include nine alumni — whom the organization said were chosen to represent the alumni network’s depth of diversity — was to avoid turning the meeting into an overstatement of disapproval, Dorn said. The alumni reiterated their desire to work with the USCAA and engage in collaborative efforts to improve the alumni engagement model, he said. 
“I think most of all [we are] excited that we found what appeared to be, at this point in time, willing partners on the other side,” Dorn said. ”Hopefully we can all come together and reach an acceptable compromise that makes the alumni happy but also satisfies the needs of the University.”
“The previous alumni engagement model provided graduates throughout the country with communities of alumni to connect and establish professional relationships to advance their careers,” Karen Lowell, former president of the Phoenix Alumni Club, said. She said she believes the structural changes fail to uphold these benefits in the shift to the region-based format.
“The USCAA’s new model doesn’t really seem to appreciate the personal connections that developed through the regional clubs,” Lowell said. 
The strength of the alumni clubs came from their ability to forge strong Trojan communities outside of L.A. and California, said Lance Weber, a 1993 graduate. He said the regional alumni club leadership provided a “bridge between the University and the local people.” Weber said he believes local events and activities connected alumni to their regional clubs and strengthened their connection to the University.
“I’m just very concerned that the loss of that linkage … will weaken the relationship between the alumni and the University,” Weber said.
According to the town hall, the new alumni engagement structure is the first to develop in any university and is an untested model that has been in development for three years. The goal of this new model is to establish a centralized method of event planning aimed at standardizing alumni engagement throughout the country. These changes do not impact cultural nor international alumni networks.
“The Trojan Family is our University’s greatest asset, and we want everyone to have the chance to take advantage of everything it has to offer,” the USCAA wrote in the same email to the Daily Trojan.

USC’s staunch defensive line will have a key loss to overcome if there is Pac-12 football this spring. Redshirt junior defensive lineman Jay Tufele announced Wednesday via Twitter that he will opt out of the upcoming season and declare for the 2021 NFL Draft. 
“I have come to the point where it is time for me to do what is best for my career and family,” Tufele wrote in the Twitter statement, also thanking his family, academic staff, coaches, teammates and fans for their support. “Although it pains me to leave all the people who have become so instrumental in my life, know that I will carry all of you with me in my heart as I embark on the next phase of my journey.”
USC led the Pac-12 South in 2019 with 35 sacks, 4.5 of which came courtesy of Tufele. He added two more tackles for loss on the season en route to earning a spot on the All-Pac-12 First Team and winning USC’s Defensive Lineman of the Year award for the second straight season. 
Tufele appeared in all of USC’s 25 games across his redshirt freshman and redshirt sophomore seasons, totaling 65 tackles — including 7.5 sacks as well as 11 tackles for a combined loss of 47 yards. He also returned a fumble for a 48-yard touchdown against Utah and blocked a potential game-tying field goal toward the end of a win over Washington State in 2018. 
Tufele has been pegged as a potential first round pick in the draft and ranks at No. 22 on football analyst and draft expert Mel Kiper’s Big Board. 
He is the first USC football player to opt out of a potential 2021 spring season, a move which may become common across the NCAA over the next several months due to both coronavirus concerns and the timing of the season just before the late-April draft. 
“When I reflect on my time at USC, I think of all the memorable interactions with you all that have helped me grow,” Tufele’s statement read. “USC and Los Angeles have forced me to stretch myself physically and mentally and I am forever thankful. I will always cherish the positive memories made.” 
Tufele’s decision leaves sophomore Drake Jackson as the likely centerpiece of the Trojans’ defensive line efforts in 2021. Jackson led the team in sacks and tackles for loss last year with 6.5 and 11.5, respectively.

The University Park Campus may resemble a ghost town these days — lecture halls are empty, Trousdale Parkway is quiet and the anticipation that typically marks the onset of the college football season is absent — but the streets surrounding campus are anything but. 
Crowds at USC Village appear to increase by the day, moving trucks have become a regular sight and students’ social media feeds are abuzz with new photos and videos of students returning to campus. 
Though these sights might offer some fleeting sense of normalcy to the USC community, they have also made one reality painfully clear: Despite six months of sporadic quarantine measures, dizzying lockdowns, a slew of mask mandates and almost 200,000 deaths, one precaution has not yet sunk in for many Trojans: wearing a goddamn mask. 
This is not to say that students are running wild around campus, maskless, coughing and spitting on any pedestrian that might unfortunately find themselves in such a mob’s crosshairs. In fact, despite some students’ neglect, a great many do appear to be taking public health precautions seriously. 
Still, this does not lessen the shameful spotlight that must be fixed on those that do not. These students — and there are more than enough of them to warrant an op-ed of this sort — walk the halls of cramped shared living spaces unmasked and stroll the streets surrounding campus unmasked, seemingly without a care in the entire world. They not only demonstrate a blatant disregard for their community but also an almost inexplicable ignorance to the detriment of their own futures and the future of our country.  
There are two elements that define one’s failure to wear a mask. One is moral and centered on a concern for one’s neighbors and community, and another is largely pragmatic, primarily borne out of self-interest. 
From a moral perspective, those who fail to wear a mask fail on a human level. They recklessly put the lives and livelihoods of those around them at risk. Fundamentally, what they are doing is dangerous. In layman’s terms, they are exhibiting their shortcomings as a considerate human being. 
On the other hand, from a purely self-interested perspective, not responsibly wearing a mask is moronic. The longer the virus spreads within our community, the longer lockdown measures will persist, which not only means more businesses closed and lives ruined but also the continued diminishment of job and internship prospects for USC students. Even the most egocentric, self-centered of Trojans should find this troubling. 
To make matters worse, there is absolutely no excuse for students’ failures. The verdict on masks’ efficacy is in — they work. Despite what feckless Republican diatribes might suggest, masks have been proven to significantly reduce the likelihood of community transmission. Countless medical studies and journals have proven this to be the case and, in light of this, it is inconceivable how students at USC, a school that prides itself on a low acceptance rate and world-class education, have opted to prioritize their own superficial comfort over the well-being of those around them. 
It should also be noted that those around them are not only students but the South Central community at large. It is no secret that those likely to be harmed the most by students’ privileged negligence aren’t the students themselves, but those who have no choice but to be in proximity to them: movers, custodial staff, security guards, couriers and the like. Not to mention the countless families that call the surrounding community home, many of whom face structural barriers to attaining high-quality healthcare and treatment. 
USC students are visitors in their communities. South Central’s residents — residents who, demographically speaking, are being disproportionately killed by the virus— should not be forced to suffer the brunt of the pandemic’s structural carnage just because white, rich students at USC are too self-absorbed to consider their well-being. 
None of what has been written here should be a revelation to students. None of what has been written here should be considered “woke” or intellectually exceptional. The efficacy of masks has been well-documented for months now. The severity of the pandemic has been apparent for half of a year. A USC degree isn’t required to know this. 
Instead, the purpose of this op-ed is to hopefully serve as an effective reminder to students. Thousands of Americans die every day from the coronavirus. Scores of Americans are suffering from acute physical pain and financial ruin, many in Los Angeles. The very least the USC student body can do is shed some ignorance, exercise some empathy and wear a mask.

Amid a national reckoning on racial injustice in the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery (among many others), protests and increased support for the Black Lives Matter movement, colleges and governments have moved to confront anti-Blackness and systemic racism. 
President Carol Folt, in a May 31 email, called on the Trojan community to embrace a culture of respect for all. Weeks later, in an Instagram post on June 17, Kappa Alpha Order — a fraternity with a deeply racist legacy — announced that it would return back to USC after many years of hiatus and seek to reestablish itself throughout Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.
Greek life at USC and throughout the nation has recently come under fire. Instagram accounts such as @black_at_usc and @abolishgreekusc have served as platforms to elevate student voices and experiences with discrimination and racism in Greek life. For IFC and Fraternity & Sorority Leadership Development to allow for Kappa Alpha Order’s recolonization despite its racist ties signals a lack of sensitivity to the social movements that have come to define 2020 and an indifference to implementing efforts of diversity, equity and inclusion.
Nationally, Kappa Alpha has a deeply troubling history. The fraternity claims Robert E. Lee as its spiritual founder due to his religious convictions and gentlemanly conduct while president of Washington and Lee University. Elevating Lee in this manner mirrors the negationist ideology of the Lost Cause and whitewashes the Confederate cause as a noble one. The Lost Cause of the Confederacy perpetuates a revisionist ideology of the Civil War that argues it was not primarily about slavery, glamorizes Lee and other generals as exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry and romanticizes a particular southern way of life.
Kappa Alpha chooses to ignore Lee’s role in defending the supposed authority of the South to own human beings as property as well as his betrayal of his country in defending that institution. It reduces the sum of human virtue to a fetishization of decorum and gentlemanlike conduct. 
However, the racist legacy of Kappa Alpha goes far deeper than Lee. In 1922, Samuel Zenas Ammen, the “practical founder” of the fraternity, wrote that the Ku Klux Klan and Kappa Alpha were founded upon “reactions against the same evils” — four years before the fraternity first came to USC. The insignia of “KA” is also based on an antebellum fraternity that would ultimately come to serve as an inspiration for the name and ritual of the KKK, while chapters across the country also referred to themselves as “Klans” until at least the 1950s.
More recently, the national organization of Kappa Alpha suspended a chapter at Southwestern University in Texas for formally denouncing Lee and the Confederacy, indicating that the national organization of Kappa Alpha Order has no intention to reconcile its racist past. Instead, the organization seeks to uphold racist power structures by glorifying an old-time, supposedly southern way of life that is built directly upon this country’s legacy of racism. Despite everything, Kappa Alpha is doing this all in 2020, right when America is experiencing a long overdue awakening to systemic racism. It seems that the national organization of Kappa Alpha is not. 
By no means is Kappa Alpha alone in the fraternity world when it comes to championing Confederate leaders. Kappa Sigma, another fraternity at USC, identifies Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States, as its only honorary member, even though the fraternity was founded after the fall of the Confederacy. 
Regardless, Kappa Alpha maintains a deeply problematic history that USC, FSLD and the IFC must not feign ignorance toward. The very existence of Kappa Alpha Order is inherently and necessarily tied to white-nationalist racism in tune with the Lost Cause ideology. 
Allowing back on the University’s campus a fraternity that idolizes Lee, helped shape the KKK and is founded upon a belief in the Lost Cause of the Confederacy would enable the perpetuation of historically racist organizations at this institution. So long as entities like Kappa Alpha Order are allowed to remain on — or return to — our campus, Folt’s anti-racist efforts will inevitably fall short and amount merely to corrective memos and apologies in order to avoid controversy. 
Given that formal recruitment for fraternities begins on Friday, Aug. 21, it is imperative that IFC, FSLD and USC take immediate, concerted action to reject the reestablishment of this fraternity and reevaluate their commitment to efforts of diversity, equity and inclusion.

Sophomore Shreya Chanda was sworn in as an Undergraduate Student Government senator during the first Senate meeting of the 2020-21 academic year Tuesday. Chanda fills the vacancy left after the resignation of senator-elect Isabel Washington following surfaced accounts of racist and classist remarks on social media this summer. 
Following anonymous submissions to @black_at_usc — an Instagram account created to provide a space for Black Trojans to share their experiences of racism and microaggressions on campus — that allege discriminatory behavior by Washington, text screenshots between Washington and former assistant director Nathaniel Manor also emerged displaying crude and bigoted language. Washington resigned amid the scandal, leaving a position that would have been open to Manor since he ranked 13th in the USG 2020-21 Senator elections, garnering 976 votes. 
In a communitywide letter, USG stated that Manor would not be considered for the role. However, in an interview with the Daily Trojan Speaker of the Senate Gabe Savage said Manor declined the position when offered to him. Chanda was next in line to be offered the position and garnered 937 votes in the Senate election.    
Chanda, who is majoring in global health, said that although this semester is being conducted in an unprecedented manner following many changes within USG, she is excited and committed to serve the undergraduate student body. 
“I’m really ready to get some good work done,” Chanda said during the induction, “and I really hope that despite all the challenges we face, not only with the student government but with USC and just life, in general, we can all move forward in a safe, healthy and progressive manner.
Later in the meeting, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly co-executive director Jessica Kim, a junior majoring in environmental engineering, raised the issue of protocol for filling the open positions of president and vice president. Former executives Truman Fritz and Rose Ritch resigned from their respective positions this summer after calls for their impeachment amassed following allegations that Fritz made anti-Black remarks on multiple occasions and Ritch had remained complicit. 
In a public statement obtained by the Daily Trojan that was sent to USG July 6, the USG Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council recommended that the USG Executive Cabinet step down along with Fritz and Ritch due to their  “lack of transparency and failure to show accountability” towards addressing the discriminatory actions committed by their members. The executive cabinet includes in addition to the president and vice president, the chief of staff, the speaker of the senate, the chief financial officer, the chief programming officer, the chief communications officer and the chief diversity officer. Although released as a public statement, the letter was not released to the student body by USG. 
“USG has historically lacked representation and inclusion of [Black, Indigenous and people of color] communities, and the organization as a whole must have leaders with varying experiences to create an inclusive campus,” the statement read. “As the Cabinet collectively lacks this understanding, we ask for their voluntary resignations to demonstrate their commitment to and acknowledgment of the lack of BIPOC representation within USG as a whole.”
The Council also made recommendations to USG that include the implementation of mandatory bystander intervention and bias training by incoming USG leadership, for the new president and vice president to provide rationale to Cabinet position appointments to the student body and to release public information of Black and Indigenous people and people of color representation in the organization. 
Savage did not respond in time for publication about the DEI statement.
As Speaker of the Senate, and by virtue of USG bylaws, Savage will be filling the role of USG president for the remainder of the term. With Chanda’s inauguration, the Senate is currently at full capacity of 12 members, allowing them to move forward in voting for the new speaker of the senate and vice president, both of which will be filled by current senators. Savage and the appointed vice president will then be sworn in, leaving two new vacancies in the Senate.
USG’s bylaws state these positions will be offered to those who ran but did not win Senate seats in the general election. The roles will be offered to the candidates with the highest number of votes that currently do not hold office. According to Savage, one of the two Senate seats is accounted for and the second is awaiting confirmation, after which they will be sworn in during the following Senate meeting.

Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Shreya Chanda’s name. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In the wake of incidents of anti-Black racism occurring on and off campus, Maya Desai, along with five of her peers challenged themselves to make an impact. 
Starting in June, she tasked herself with several responsibilities, ranging from contacting artists on campus to writing scripts for phone calls to senators. After several virtual meetings and many hours, they created USC Black Lives Matter Resources, a website aimed at empowering Black voices through facilitating education. 
The site launched July 3 in response to numerous calls to the USC administration to dismantle systems that have historically oppressed Black students, such as the Department of Public Safety, and improve Black representation on campus. 
Upon reaching the site, bolded letters greet the visitor: “As USC students, we have the privilege and resources to learn. Educate yourself and others.” Below, in unbolded text, a call to action: “Start now, start here.”
Over the course of one month, the six students said they set out to research all the different ways people can educate themselves on and participate in anti-racist efforts. They compiled petitions circulating the internet that champion racial justice and assembled a list of Black-owned restaurants around campus.
While the internet has a wealth of resources to get involved and educated, Eshana Seshadri, a junior majoring in computational neuroscience, said many students feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start. She wanted the website to be a starting point, where anyone could access a variety of resources. 
“There are so many petitions going out there, fundraisers, and we thought it could be pretty useful [for the website] to serve as this hub,” Seshadri said. “We just wanted to do our part as non-Black [people of color] in helping this movement move forward.”
The mission statement outlines various demands such as the reform of the University’s general education curriculum and calls for student-run organizations to be more inclusive. However, Desai, a junior majoring in politics, philosophy and law, said these points only represent some of the public changes that the USC community is fighting for. 
“Our list of demands is not holistic,” Desai said. “There are obviously a lot of things the University could do in addition to them to create effective change within our community.”
The team updates the site often with new petitions, fundraisers and educational resources that relate to the USC community, such as efforts to end campus ties with LAPD, student-led sales to support Black Lives Matter and a link to the Off the Track podcast where USC Track athletes discuss social justice. 
Desai engaged with anti-racism work in other projects before she got the idea to work on the website. She first created a fundraiser for the NAACP and other organizations with her peers in Project Rishi, a student organization that focuses on fostering sustainable development in rural India, raised more than $100,000. Posts on the @black_at_usc Instagram page, which feature anonymous stories of racist incidents that Black students face, also helped her understand the power a site of curated resources could have. 
“It made me realize that stuff like donations is great but we also need to tackle the end goal of educating people and highlighting the experiences of the voices that need to be heard most right now,” Desai said. 
Beyond containing links to petitions and fundraisers, the website also underscores overlooked aspects involved with learning to be actively anti-racist, showcases the work of Black dancers, musicians and filmmakers on campus.
Keviette Minor, a senior majoring in design whose work focuses on her experiences as a Black woman and the feelings of rejection she has often felt, is one of many artists whose work is featured on the site. 
“I was so happy that it was all kind of in one place,” Minor said. “I even got introduced to other Black students on campus that are in this town that maybe I haven’t met yet. It was really inspiring to have it.” Minor encouraged people that come to the website to make a genuine effort to have conversations with the artists and discuss their work.
These artists, Minor believes, may not find the right exposure at USC or other major platforms due to systemic issues that fail to provide appropriate Black representation. 
“At an institution like USC … the experiences [of] people of color don’t really get explored in those white-walled spaces,” Minor said. 
For Rohan Palla, a junior majoring in film and TV production, collaborating on the website helped him discover the connection between South Asian and Black history. Between the website’s different pages, including those such as the section “For Non-Black [People of Color] Communities,” the driving force is to create an ergonomic environment where educating oneself is not a challenging task. Palla said this goal was only possible by ensuring the team was not focusing exclusively on non-Black community’s experiences. 
“We had one main goal: always put Black voices at the forefront of the website, especially as non-Black people creating this website,” Palla said. “The movement is not about non-Black [people of color].”
Desai, being of South Asian descent, stated that members within her community, particularly college students, can engage in meaningful conversations about anti-racism with friends and family members. She also believes the South Asian community has a privilege that is not afforded to the Black community.
“The culture of our communities is to not pay attention to things that are going on around us, stay in our own lane and mind our own business,” Seshadri said. “Ultimately, the solution comes down to being proactive.”
