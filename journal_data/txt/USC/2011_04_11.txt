USC’s quest to become a global institution has brought many students from around the world to Los Angeles, despite not being guaranteed a continued visa following graduation. Many hope that they will be able  to remain in the United States after graduation.
Sarah Bang, an international student adviser, said it is common for students to spend some time in the United States after graduation, although some go back to their home country to pursue other endeavors.
“Although many F-1 international students may prefer to remain in the U.S. temporarily to work in their field of study, not all choose to do so,” Bang wrote in an email.
F-1 students are those with non-immigrant visas that allow them to study in the United States, but do not allow for continued residence in the country after graduation.
The Optional Practical Training program allows F-1 international students to remain in the United States and gain work experience in their field of study for up to one year. The application for an OPT can take 3-4 months.
Bang said there was a 14.43-percent increase from fall 2009 to fall 2010 in F-1 students who are on Optional Practical Training, but it is unclear if this increase is the result of  the increase in number of international students or an actual trend.
Jocelyn Chan, a freshman majoring in English who is interested in pursuing a career in the music industry, said if she could find a job and get a work visa, she would like to stay in Los Angeles for some time before going back to her native home of Hong Kong.
“The advantage of staying here is access to the most advanced music industry in the world,” Chan said. “I could use what I learn here to develop the industry back there.”
Alexander Silkin, a sophomore majoring in computer science, was born in Russia, but has also lived in China and Hong Kong. He said he hopes to stay in the United States to work in the video game industry, but knows acquiring a visa will be difficult.
To get a visa, international students usually get a job with an employer willing to sponsor them, but this has become especially difficult in the current economy.
Silkin said USC has been helpful through the process.
“USC provides career services, which aid you and job searches,” Silkin said. “USC provides you the basic tools and the education, but you have to take that somewhere.”
Bang said USC does offer aid to students who decide to stay in the country through the USC Career Planning & Placement Center, which offers guidance on job search processes in the United States, and the Office of International Students, which partners with CPPC to offer workshops a few times a semester, Bang wrote.
Zoltan Povazsay, a senior majoring in business and originally from Hungary, said he would like to stay here if he can get a visa or green card. He said being here for college has made the area his home.
“I feel like I’ve been here for the best five years,” Povazsay said. “I like my home country too, but I feel like the opportunities here are a lot better.”

Attending USC without financial aid costs at least $41,000 per year, not including books and other expenses. Graduating a semester early can save students thousands of dollars and give them a chance to either begin working earlier or just take a break.
Ceremony · Students from the class of 2009 walk on Hellman Way on May 15, 2009 for their graduation. The main graduation ceremony for the USC class of 2011 will begin at 9 a.m. on May 13, 2011. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
Although rare — less than 1 percent of students leave USC early — Associate Registrar Matt Bemis said graduating early is “definitely not unheard of.”
Leher Pathak, a junior majoring in communication, transferred to USC as a sophomore and plans to graduate after this fall semester to save money. Pathak said graduating early will relieve financial stress on her family.
“I had enough credits from my old school. I could have spread out my courses to just two classes senior year, but decided not to because it saved money,” Pathak said.
Pathak said she originally had no intentions of graduating early.
“Even now, it’s not something I’m super excited about because I’m going to miss all my friends,” Pathak said. “I’d love to be here for the entire time, but it’s not practical, so I have to go for it.”
Nora Sassounian, a junior majoring in international relations, will also graduate a semester early by using AP credits to satisfy unit requirements.
Like Pathak, Sassounian too said she did not originally plan to graduate early.
“I definitely had not planned an early graduation,” Sassounian said. “The idea came to me fall of junior year while I was prepping for the LSAT and realized I had a lot of credits. I talked to my parents and decided it’d be a nice break personally and financially to graduate early.”
Sassounian took a full course load at USC, averaging 18 units each semester, and will use the semester off as a break, since she plans to attend law school in the fall.
Sassounian said she doesn’t feel like she will be “missing out” by graduating early because she plans to attend school in the fall. She also said she still had “the undergraduate experience.”
“During my years at USC, I’ve done a pretty good job of taking advantage of opportunities,” said Sassounian. “I lived on campus two years, I was president of my sorority and I really made the most of my time here.”

USC recently opened its first office in New York City, hoping to enhance the university’s presence on the East Coast and attract more donations.
“The New York office is responsible for creating a more visible presence for USC in New York and throughout the northeast region, and establishing support, including philanthropic support, for the university’s strategic goals and objectives,” Albert Checcio, senior vice president of university advancement, and Courtney Surls, vice president for development of university advancement wrote in an email.
The office will handle general issues regarding USC and its East Coast presence, spanning from alumni relations to student affairs.
Receiving philanthropic support from USC alumni has become a priority for the university, and this office was created largely to help achieve their fundraising goals, Checcio and Surls wrote.
“We have two primary responsibilities in the New York office. One is to assess the broader regional needs to build the visibility of the university and make recommendations to that end,” said Maria Watson, the new executive director of the New York office. “The second is to leverage significant philanthropic support from individuals for the future initiatives of USC.”
The university hopes these donations will assist students in the long-run.
“The new resources will positively impact and improve almost every aspect of campus life — from more scholarships for students, to new buildings and facilities, and to recruitment of leading faculty and researchers,” Checcio and Surls wrote.
Currently, the office is fairly small, with a staff of three.
As USC’s first office in New York City, the new regional office has been charged with making USC’s presence prominent in the northeast.
“The Trojan Family is quite strong in New York City,” Watson said. “There are 4,000 alumni and potential donors that live or work in New York City alone, and there are approximately 16,000 alumni who live in the northeast. This office will be working to engage that group of people,” Watson said.
Students are generally excited by the opportunities presented by the new office.
“I will most likely go to New York after college to work, so it’s good that they’ve opened this office [so I can] maintain this connection to the school,” said Adam Nusbaum, a freshman majoring in business administration.
USC has comparable offices in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento, as well as around the globe, in countries including China, Japan, India and Mexico. The university is also planning to open a San Francisco office later this year, according to Checcio and Surls.
Since its opening, the office has invited the USC Alumni Club of New York’s board to its office for a gathering. Additionally, a series of events to commemorate the opening is planned for the coming months, according to Watson.
Checcio and Surls were not willing to comment about the cost of the new office.

Yet another earthquake struck Japan early Tuesday morning, killing at least six people. The 6.4 magnitude quake triggered a landslide that buried three homes in Iwaki, according to the city’s fire department.
The quake was centered about 100 miles northeast of Tokyo and around 30 miles southwest of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, according to the United States Geological Survey. Although the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, the Tokyo Electric Power Company reported that around 220,000 households and businesses in Fukushima were left without power.
Japan has been hit with hundreds of aftershocks since the original magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck on March 11th. More than 13,116 people have been confirmed dead and over 14,000 people remain missing from the original quake.

Sometime next football season, there will be one very big addition to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum — a 6,000-square-foot video board.
Landmark · USC has played at the L.A. Coliseum since the 93,000-seat stadium opened in 1923, and expects to see more renovations in the future. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
The new board, measuring 150- feet wide by 40-feet tall, will be constructed at the west side of the stadium. The screen will show live game action, replays and down and distances as part of an effort to “improve the fan experience at Trojan football games,” according to USCRipsit.com.
“The game day experience is of the utmost importance to us as we continue to make improvements along with our partners at the Coliseum,” said Associate Athletic Director Jose Eskenazi. “We feel that we are making progress every day.”
Though USC does not own the Coliseum, it signed a extendable 25-year lease with the Coliseum Commission in 2008 after the university threatened to move home games to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. unless much-needed improvements were made.
When the agreement was signed, it was stipulated that new video displays, concession areas, seating, drainage systems, elevators, escalators and locker rooms be added to the 87-year-old Coliseum on the Commission’s dime.
Prior to the start of the 2008 season, a new sound system and two full-color LED video boards were installed, as well as new seating sections at the north and southeast corners of the stadium.

For only the third time this season and for the first time since spring break, USC baseball will face a sub-.500 foe, as it takes  on Pepperdine at 3 p.m. today in Malibu, Calif.
It’s a welcome change for a team that has faced ranked teams in nine of its last 11 games, going 5-6 in that span.
The Trojans (13-19, 4-5) are fresh off their first Pac-10 series win of the season last weekend, when they took two of three from No. 11 Stanford.
“I’m hoping we can carry some of this momentum to Tuesday,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz, whose team recently won its first Pac-10 series of the year following two victories against the Cardinal.
The Waves (15-16), however, are no pushover. They recently knocked off a UC Santa Barbara team that has beaten the Trojans twice this year, and they have split their last six games against USC.
Cruz knows the Waves well, having faced them three times a year as coach of West Coast Conference rival Loyola Marymount for 12 seasons.
“Pepperdine usually plays pretty well,” Cruz said. “Every team we play is tough.”
The Waves are led by fifth-year senior catcher Trent Diedrich and junior outfielder Brian Humphries. Each is hitting above .300 and slugging .423.
On the mound, Pepperdine is expected to toss sophomore Alex Najera. With an ERA above six and more walks than strikeouts, the lefty has been less than stellar this season.
“We need to make sure we have the same mentality we had over the weekend,” Cruz said. “Get quality at-bats early, get the leadoff guy on.”
It has been paramount for the Trojans to get on the board first this season, as they are 10-4 when they push the first run across the plate and just 3-15 when their opponents do.
It will be up to junior starter Brandon Garcia to keep the Waves off the board.
The right-hander went five strong innings last Tuesday against Loyola Marymount, but Cruz was reluctant to start him.
“The problem with pitching Garcia on Tuesday is that you don’t have him on the weekend until Sunday,” Cruz said. “Obviously he’s an important guy for us.”
Garcia faced five hitters in Sunday’s win over Stanford, and had some trouble throwing strikes. He walked one batter, hit another and was tagged with two runs in just two-thirds of an inning.
Had Garcia pitched more Sunday, it would have been difficult for him to recover on just one day of rest.
“We’ll probably have him give us three solid innings,” Cruz said. “Make it a staff day. That way we can have him starting Friday.”
Sophomore third baseman Adam Landecker remains out with a hamstring injury, forcing junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa to move across the infield and putting junior Matt Foat at first.
Sophomore J.R. Aguirre will continue to start in left field. The walk-on, hitting nearly .300 since he’s become a regular in the lineup, has become a spark for the Trojans on the field, including a straight steal of home on a botched squeeze play over the weekend.

I woke up yesterday to an email from USC football announcing Tuesday’s “Trojan Day” at L.A. Live.
USC coach Lane Kiffin, his father Monte and Ed Orgeron will be there signing autographs. Season tickets will be available for purchase. But the most promising part of the email was written in all capitals at the top:
“Take a picture with a Heisman Trophy and the BCS National Championship Trophy.”
I immediately cleared my entire afternoon to make sure I didn’t miss this opportunity. It might be the closest USC will get to a BCS national championship or a Heisman Trophy for a very long time. 
So clear your schedules. All fans should be in attendance. The players should go, too. Why not take some photos with a prize the NCAA probably won’t even let the team compete for next season?
All sarcasm aside, if you’re a fan and you want to get autographs from Trojan coaches, more power to you. But I can’t help but point out the irony of USC personnel posing with college football’s two biggest awards, the same two that were effectively stripped from the Trojans program.
The Trojans were forced to vacate their 2005 Orange Bowl victory, which means the Big Brother NCAA has altered history and USC never hoisted the crystal ball in the first place. Reggie Bush chose to give back his Heisman to the Heisman Trophy Trust before it was taken away from him. USC had Bush’s replica Heisman removed from Heritage Hall even before that.
What would turn this silly public relations event into an actual statement is if fans could take pictures with both tainted trophies: Bush’s real Heisman and the actual 2004 national championship trophy.
These two pieces of hardware represent USC’s peak and its downfall. USC was at the height of its power when these two trophies were won, yet, as if the Trojans made a deal with the devil, they are still paying for that glory.
USC continues to patiently await the results of an appeal that common sense says should come out in favor of the Trojans, but harsh reality says will not. The Trojans might get a few scholarships back, but something tells me that second year of the bowl ban is staying.
The fallout from the NCAA sanctions, along with Pete Carroll’s departure, has set the USC program back perhaps a decade. Think last season was a major disappointment? The effects are only going to get worse from here.
“The next year is where we start hitting the sanctions,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden told CBSsports.com two weeks ago. “You’re going to see this thing really develop three, four, five years from now. Our fan base may not understand, ‘What do you mean the sanctions are hitting? That was years ago.’”
But it wasn’t. It seems USC has been sanctioned indefinitely. Because of the drawn out appeal, the effects of the sanctions have been extended. Even when they are technically fulfilled, USC is going to feel the effects years down the line.
Maybe USC gets lucky and gets back its bowl eligibility this season, but all or most of the scholarship reductions remain.
The sad truth is that Tuesday’s event at L.A. Live is still the closest USC will get to that BCS crystal ball in the foreseeable future.
The Trojans have a few phenomenal players, but the depth of past championship seasons isn’t there. Realistically, a team just can’t win a national title without depth. The core of this team is strong, but not quite championship-caliber.
Then look at what could happen before the 2012 season.
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley could forgo his senior year and enter the NFL draft. Defensive end Nick Perry could do the same. Seniors like Chris Galippo, Devon Kennard and Marc Tyler will have used up all of their eligibility.
The worst-case scenario would leave USC young and inexperienced. And with fewer scholarships at his disposal, Kiffin will be unable to reload.
USC will put together a good, but not great, team this season. As it stands now, the NCAA sanctions will keep the Trojans out of a bowl game. And their lasting effects will keep them out of major bowl games for years to come, away from BCS trophies and probably Heisman’s too.
Anybody still up for the photo-op at L.A. Live?

Fight on!
The bandwagon left the station last year, so whoever is left is the true fan and true fans stick by their team through thick and thin.  I will still root for the Trojans whether or not they are bowl eligible, win or lose, rain or shine.  Fight on!
Fight On !
Devon Kennard will be a junior this season, and have one more year of eligibility.  USC should have a better season this year than last.  Losing the appeal as expected will have its impact, but it is doesn’t do much good to dwell on the negative.  Fight on!

Defense was the cornerstone of USC’s success during USC’s unprecedented run of seven consecutive Pac-10 titles from 2002-2008.
The defense reached its pinnacle in 2008, when the Trojans allowed just nine points and 221 yards per game, among the best in conference history.
Changes · USC assistant head coach Monte Kiffin has argued allowing tackling in practice would help USC improve defensively in 2011. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
But two years later, USC coach Pete Carroll bolted for the Seattle Seahawks and the NCAA placed USC on a four-year probation.  Simultaneously, the Trojans experienced a dramatic dip on the defensive side of the ball.
In spite of such struggles, USC assistant head coach Monte Kiffin, the famed architect of the “Tampa-2” defense, and defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron remain hopeful this spring that the team’s 2010 performance was simply an aberration.
“[The defense] has to be better and it’s going to be,” Orgeron said. “I think they understand the effort and the commitment it takes.”
No doubt the Trojans are in need of an overhaul, after one of the worst seasons in school history — at least statistically, as the 2010 defense surrendered the most yards per game by a USC team since 1955, allowing an astonishly high 400.
Equally disturbing, the team surrendered 26.7 points per game — the second worst mark in school history since the statistic was first calculated.
“We gave up too many big plays, runs or passes,” Kiffin said. “You want to be so good and you start pressing and you try to make too many plays and then you give up the big play.”
The team’s season opener at Hawai’i on Sept. 2 was indicative of things to come, as the Warriors amassed 588 yards of total offense — 459 coming through the air — and scored 36 points in a surprising display of offense.
Later in the year, Washington (536 yards), Stanford (498 yards) and Oregon (599 yards) all torched the young defense.
Part of the reason, at least in Kiffin’s mind, for the defensive difficulties, stemmed from a “no-tackling” policy instituted by his son, USC coach Lane Kiffin, to combat the team’s serious depth issues stemming from the NCAA sanctions that caused players to transfer.
But with the actual season not scheduled to begin for another five months, the policy has been lifted, at least for now.
“The name of the game is tackling the guy with the football,” said the elder Kiffin. “You don’t have to be a scientist to figure that out. We were so banged up last year that we couldn’t [tackle]. And as we practice tackling, we are going to be a better tackling team.”
With the team’s slightly improved play from a year ago in wins over California and UCLA, where the Trojans surrendered just 14 points, and more opportunities in spring practice, Monte Kiffin sees reason for optimism.
“Being the second year in the system the guys understand things a little bit better,” Monte Kiffin said. “They are playing faster. At times last year, we were thinking too much instead of reacting. Defense is really just about getting to the football, making plays and not giving up too many explosion plays.”
But familiarity might be equally as important after 13 games in a new scheme, allowing players the opportunity to adjust. The defense, as a result, appears to have a much better grasp of the concepts this spring.
“[Familiarity] will help us,” Monte Kiffin said. “It’s important just to be back in the system. We lost some guys, but we have some good young players coming in as well.”
Nonetheless, the defense has shown signs of improvement this spring, particularly in its youthful secondary, as three of the four spots at cornerback and safety have already been solidified by junior cornerback Tony Burnett, junior safety T.J. McDonald and sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey.
“It’s pretty good to see three of your secondary positions filled and to feel this good about them this early on,” Lane Kiffin said.
The coaching staff has simplified various schemes in order to showcase the talent on the roster to combat that lack of experience.
“[None of the schemes] are new,” Orgeron said. “We simplified things on defense, so where there shouldn’t be as much thinking and we can play faster. That should help us this year.”

In an oft-replayed television commercial, legendary quarterback Archie Manning pretends to adopt former USC quarterback Matt Leinart, telling his real children, current NFL quarterbacks Eli and Payton Manning, “I always wanted a lefty.”
Success · While starting for USC from 2003-2005, Leinart compiled a 37-2 record, won a Heisman Trophy in 2004 and led USC to back-to-back national championships. He was drafted No. 10 overall by the Arizona Cardinals in the 2006 NFL draft. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
Coming out of USC, it did not seem unrealistic for Leinart to follow in the professional footsteps of the Manning brothers.
In college, Leinart was awarded the Heisman Trophy while leading USC to consecutive national championships (an Associated Press title in 2003 and a BCS title in 2004) — accomplishments neither Manning brother ever achieved.
Yet, five years into his NFL career, Leinart has not appeared in more than eight games in a season since his rookie season with the Arizona Cardinals in 2006, and has thrown more interceptions (20) than touchdowns (14) as a professional.
“My career has been like a roller coaster,” Leinart said. “You never know what is going to happen next.”
Leinart was on USC’s campus last week to speak on a panel at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism titled, “For The Good Of The Game: The NFL At A Crossroads.” The panel also included New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez and sports agent Leigh Steinberg.
If any player is at a crossroads, it is Leinart, who is desperately seeking a starting position after spending much of his professional career as a backup.
“A lot of football is about being in the right situation at the right time with the right kind of people,” said Leinart, who after being the No. 10 overall pick in the 2006 NFL draft, saw a coaching change in Arizona from Dennis Green to Ken Whisenhunt. “People get so few opportunities in the NFL. They do not come around very often.”
Leinart, however, is accustomed to having to wait for opportunities.
Playing behind Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer, Leinart redshirted his first year at USC and did not throw a pass as redshirt freshman in 2001.
Leinart contemplated transferring, but ultimately decided to stay at USC and was named the starting quarterback his sophomore year. He threw a touchdown to Mike Williams on his first career pass attempt.
“Obviously, staying at USC worked out great for me,” Leinart said.
In the NFL, Leinart was stuck for much of his early career playing behind Kurt Warner, who led the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in team history.
Following Warner’s retirement after the 2009 season, Leinart was beat out by Derek Anderson for the starting job, and as a result, was released by the team before signing with the Houston Texans to backup Matt Schaub.
Leinart benefited from the change of scenery in Houston. Although he did not attempt a pass with the Texans, he regained the belief in his abilities that was wavering as he sat on the bench in Arizona.
“Houston helped me get my confidence back, being around great coaches and a great team,” Leinart said. “It has jumpstarted me this offseason.”
Because of the current NFL lockout, players are barred from signing contracts with any team. Therefore, even though Leinart is a free agent, he can only wait to find out which team he will play for next.
“I am not going to give up,” Leinart said. “I am not going to say it has been unfair, but I am just hoping for the opportunity to come.”
Critics have argued Leinart has not demonstrated the necessary dedication to be a successful NFL starting quarterback. Much has been written about his off-the-field behavior, including conflicts with coaches and work ethic after photos were captured in 2008 of Leinart partying at his Scottsdale, Ariz. home with Arizona State co-eds.
“You can either give in to all of the criticism, or you can use it as fuel and motivation,” Leinart said. “I know what I can do. I am just waiting for the opportunity to go show it.”
But Leinart, who has proved skeptics wrong in the past, is salivating at the chance to be able to do it again.
“I have had a lot of learning experiences and ups and downs, but I know that I have grown as a player and as a person, on and off the football field,” Leinart said. “I am totally ready to take advantage of the next opportunity I get.”
I am a cardinals fan and also watched many USC games while Leinart was still there. When his starting QB job was taken by Kurt Warner in 2007, I thought he was not ready for it and all he needed is time. During the time when he was the 2nd QB for Cardinals, I explained his poor performance as not having enough time on the field. In the preseason of 2010, which I expected him to learn some stuff from Kurt, I finally realized that HE GAINED NOTHING EXCEPT A LOT OF MONEY IN THESE YEARS. I believe that Heisman Trophy is the final chapter of his glorious football carrier and the only word for his professional part is BUST.
Dude you were so consistent at USC and showed flashes with the cardinals. The coaches never gave you an honest shot and I’m a cardinals fan. This bs about he was there for years and could not bet anderson is ridiculous. Every qb a team goes with gets several games or seasons to feel out. Practice and pre season was whiz theatre. I’m looking forward to seeing you succeed elsewhere, just hope it’s not in san Fran.
He should give his old coach a call and see if they can give him a shot in Seattle.
The dude was awesome as a Trojan and I wish him luck this coming season wherever he will play.  Fight on!
Maybe he has finally learned a little humility since his senior year. I  remember at Salute To Troy when his bodyguard told everyone, “No autographs”. The bad taste still lingers. I’ll bet Paris Hilton won’t answer your phone calls anymore…Hollywood Matt. Some lessons take time to learn. Fight On!
GO TROJAN.  Thank you for your USC play.

Bread is often the most feared food group in the American diet.
Why? Those carbs seem impossible to avoid, and once you realize you can’t avoid them, they seem impossible to work off.
The munchies · Even if you do not suffer from a gluten-related illness, adapting to a gluten-free diet can help you reach your weight loss goals. - John McGillen | Daily Trojan 
Some of us might not even be unable to properly digest a loaf of sourdough — and we might not  even know it.
Gluten intolerance and celiac disease are two illnesses that render the body incapable of properly breaking down and digesting gluten, a protein found in wheat.
According to the site Mayo Clinic, common symptoms of these diseases include diarrhea, abdominal pain and trouble absorbing nutrients.
Sometimes symptoms are not this extreme, simply manifesting as intense bloating and expansion of the stomach.
Usually these symptoms go away when a person with the disease embarks on a strict gluten-free diet, which is not an easy task.
Some, however, choose to voluntarily embark on this dietary change to make their carb consumption less daunting and reap the weight-loss benefits of getting rid of gluten.
A gluten-free diet has to be free of wheat, barley, rye and any derivatives of those grains.
Gluten is not only found in breads, cookies and cakes. It is also used to thicken soups and prevent yogurt from rotting quickly.
The gluten-free diet is becoming a trend even among those who do not suffer from a specific disease that calls for this restraint.
With so much attention on eliminating carbs, dieters find a gluten-free diet beneficial for losing weight, even if they do not suffer from a gluten-related disease.
Having realized this, chain restaurants such as the Olive Garden have altered their menus to include gluten-free foods.
Of course, any diet trend catches on when celebrities tout it.
The latest celebrity to announce support for the gluten-free diet is the oh-so-fit Queen of Pop, Madonna.
In celebration of her 52nd birthday last year, Madonna served gluten-free brownies at her party.
If this is one of Madge’s tricks for keeping in shape, those looking for some pound-shedding tips might want to adopt the diet.
So if taking the gluten-free challenge sounds appealing for non-disease-related reasons, there are many ways to approach it — and it might even be simpler than you think.
You can adopt a minimalistic version of the diet, simply replacing the breads you normally eat with gluten-free types.
Gluten-free English muffins taste exactly like the normal brands, although sandwich-type breads might taste spongier than regular bread.
Once you start eating the gluten-free breads, however, it won’t be long before you and your stomach realize they are easier to digest, which can help to lose weight or ameliorate a problematic digestive system.
Ralph’s and Vons often offer these special types of breads, but everything needed for a gluten-free diet can always be found at Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods and Mother’s Market.
Putting an emphasis on brown rice and vegetables is another easy way to go gluten-free.
Even though some brown rice does contain gluten, the widely available Lundberg Whole Grain Brown Rice doesn’t, and has the added benefit of being delicious.
The best and healthiest meal you can make is brown rice, cooked veggies and a little soy sauce.
Add some spicy Sriracha sauce and you’ve just made yourself a low-fat, gluten-free, dairy-free, healthy meal.
It’s easy to digest; the brown rice only has 1.5 grams of fat per serving and the chili peppers from the Sriracha can help speed up your metabolism.
Education and awareness are the most important reasons for embarking on a new method of eating like the gluten-free diet.
Researching what has gluten in it and what doesn’t will make your endeavors much easier.
Additionally, the majority of packaged food labels specify whether products contain gluten or not.
If the product doesn’t, buy it and see what you think.
If it does, see if there are alternative options. In our starchy world, it’s worth a try.
If students (or parents) want to check this out…www.goGFchallenge.com; great way to learn more, if you are GF or are around someone GF !
I agree completely with patrojan’s comments.  I am a current USC graduate student and suffer from Celiac myself.  Over the years, I have found that one of the most difficult challenges in maintaining my diet is dealing with restaurant servers and chefs who refuse to believe that “just a little bit” of wheat, such as the thickener in a sauce, can be a problem.  
Having been diagnosed in 1997, when gluten free diners had far fewer options than they have today, I have already dealt with the unintended consequences of Atkins dieters claiming they are allergic to carbs and then stealing a bite of bread from their friends’ plates.  This type of behavior sends a message to restaurants that can lead to significant suffering for someone like myself who will react to french fries (which are often gluten free) because they have been fried in the same oil used for a gluten containing food.  My dad is too sensitive to spend more than 20 minutes in a pizza shop where the flour in the air gets accidentally swallowed and causes a reaction.
In addition, promoting a restaurant like the Olive Garden, which has only recently released a gluten free menu and has been the source of many horror stories from gluten free diners receiving sauces or pilafs that make them ill, instead of chains like Outback Steakhouse or PF Chang’s, which have been serving a wide selection of gluten free foods for many years also shows a startling lack of insight into the true gluten free community.
Reading an article that encourages more people to adopt a “gluten free diet” while simultaneously recommending soy sauce is incredibly frustrating.  Maybe the author should have recommended a “reduced gluten diet” or done a bit more research into the challenges that are actually faced by those who follow gluten free diets by necessity rather than by choice.

Another error in the article was the omission of the varying types of celiacs. Some with celiacs must also avoid cow’s dairy, which is not easy to do, and adopt rice milk, or goat’s milk. They tend to be much pricier, but any consumption of cow’s dairy in cheeses, etc., will make the consumer quite ill. You can find this all out by doing some basic Google research, or even picking up literature from dieticians, immunologists, GI doctors, and dare I say, the library ?
As a USC alumna with Celiac Disease, I think this article is relatively irresponsible. 
There is absolutely no proof that a gluten-free diet can assist with weight-loss. Often times, the substitutive grains have more calories than gluten containing grains. If a person does exhibit weight loss while on a gluten-free diet, it is generally because that individual has simply eliminate cookies, cake, licorice, highly processed foods, etc. A gluten-free brownie has the exact same or even more calories than its gluten-filled cousin. 
Also, I would like to point out a huge error in your article – soy sauce contains gluten. There are only three ingredients in traditional soy sauce – water, soy and wheat. 
The gluten-free fad that is being picked up as the “diet-of-the-moment” has many downfalls to it, and sadly this article is one of them.

As Joe Wright’s new movie Hanna receives critical praise, the film soundtrack composed by Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, aka The Chemical Brothers, is equally scintillating. For any Chems fans, these unlikely jams prove the band’s music has no limits.
Drop a beat · The Chemical Brothers’ sound on the Hanna soundtrack deviates from past albums but does a good job complementing the movie. - Photo courtesy of Big Hassle 
As Hanna assumes the position of a a young badass, The Chemical Brothers follows her long strides as she runs amok, causing expensive damage with every step she takes.
“Escape 700” brings together a Mission Impossible beat with A.R. Rahman, Slumdog Millionaire’s composer.
Yet, there is one thing missing: big drops, which The Chemical Brothers never failed to give its audience on its past efforts.
The soundtrack is different and less intense than what The Chemical Brothers normally produces with its LPs and live sets. Normally, we’d expect a more robotronic, intense drum and base sound. Not this time.
Although this sharper type of electronic mash might not be on the Chems’ track record, Rowlands and Simons adequately fulfill their duty as film composers.
Other mixes on the soundtrack give us aural shades of the classic Chemical Brothers and its ability to melt minds in the most melodic, orgasmic ways. In such moments, the dynamic duo renders the drama and action of Hanna far more riveting.
Rowlands and Simons run with Hanna in “The Devil is in the Beats,” which gives listeners the familiar urge to head-bob as as the words “Rock the Beat” surge in and out of the audio wavelengths.
Later, these beats coalesce with a muted, sitar-type rhythm. The Chemical Brothers has audibly branded this tune as one of its own, at least more so than others on the soundtrack.
In “Hanna’s Theme,” Rowlands and Simons employ their vocals in a surprising way that recalls similarly harmonic work in TV on the Radio’s “Mr. Grieves.”
Although the track is an easy listen and provides appropriate background music for Hanna and her rebellious ways, it still feels as though most other electronic groups, such as Nosaj Thing, Pretty Lights or even the notorious Soulwax, could have produced the same track with equal aplomb.
The soundtrack blends different styles of transition alongside calmer electronica. Some tribal beats can be heard, a car revving its engine appears faintly in the background and even ghost voices get their moment.
It’s calmer creativity at its best. The only track that comes close to the authentic Chemical Brothers is “Container Park.”
Because this soundtrack is conceptually different from what would normally be expected of Rowlands and Simons, it comes off as a noble testament to the Chems’ artistic audacity and willingness to experiment.
Often, artists who spend their careers slinging four-by-four beats and jams produce tracks indistinguishable from their contemporaries.
That’s what makes the Hanna soundtrack an admirable product — we see The Chemical Brothers in a more refined, patient light.
The two members exhibit more structural thought, more ease and more courage this time around. The drops are absent because here, they are not needed.
That being said, we shouldn’t get too comfortable with the softer effort from Rowlands and Simons, whose upcoming summer performances and swelling fanbase seem to indicate that the tracks of the soundtrack, will eventually be remixed for maximum pulverizing power.
The Chemical Brothers’ work on Hanna is a compelling means of proving the duo’s talents as competent musicians. But like the film’s heroine, who destroys everything in her path, the Chems seem destined to follow suit.

“It took me about a year to start hating the 9/11 victims’ families … I’m so sick of them because they’re always complaining.”
You’d think making a statement like this would be enough to get anybody fired.
But Glenn Beck, who said this on his radio show in 2005 (in the context of comparing 9/11 victims to the Katrina victims being shown on TV), somehow managed to avoid such a fate.
In fact, Beck remained so popular, he was given a self titled show on Fox News in 2009.
But last Wednesday, Fox News announced Glenn Beck would be ending this year, though the network will continue to partner with Beck’s production company to produce other programming.
Some claim Fox is cutting the show after a severe drop in ratings.
But Beck still averages 1.9 million viewers daily and the network has been consistently among the top-rated cable news networks for years.
And the highly complimentary language in Fox’s statement about the split doesn’t seem to indicate a problem with his politics.
But still, it’s possible Beck finally got too out-there for a network that says it is committed to objective journalism.
Or maybe Beck, who has expressed interest in having his own cable channel, is leaving to pursue other options.
It’s all conjecture at this point. Perhaps the more interesting question is why he was there in the first place. What roles do Beck and his theatrical antics fill on a news network?
In July 2009, Beck stated on Fox & Friends that he believed President Barack Obama holds “a deep-seated hatred for white people … This guy is, I believe, a racist.”
Beck’s incendiary statement warranted only reserved statements from Fox News executives, saying Beck does not reflect the opinion of the network (and a statement from Rupert Murdoch, CEO of Fox’s parent company, saying Beck was right). Beck then remained on air for the next two years.
Beck’s show is opinion. And with its chalkboard diagrams and puppet shows, it’s also entertainment. At least, that’s what Fox News purports.
In his interview on The Daily Show, Fox News anchor Bret Baier explained there is a difference between the network’s opinion shows and news shows, and said, “We respect the viewers’ ability to discern the difference between the two.”
But there’s something a little dangerous about Fox News’ blending of news and opinion, and journalism and entertainment.
Glenn Beck might be an opinion show, but the Fox News logo and their slogan “Fair and Balanced,” still reside on screen while Beck compares seemingly any and all liberal politicians to Hitler.
That name and logo give some sort of legitimacy to his outrageous rants, even if Beck himself says he is only offering his opinion.
Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show, might be seen as a liberal counterpart to Beck in that they both blend news and entertainment (though to very different ends).
But a crucial difference in their practices is that Stewart is a comedian hosting a comedy show on a comedy network.
Stewart might have an equally obvious bias, but he critiques figures on both ends of the political spectrum for comedy’s sake.
The vague title of “opinion show” does little to dispel the idea that news invariably associated with a 24-hour news network. Viewers turn to Fox News expecting news, expecting to learn about current events and politics.
Even if Beck’s show isn’t viewed as unbiased journalism, that doesn’t mean his opinions don’t seriously affect real people’s political views.
With the complex debates raging in Washington today, from health care to budget deficits to wars being fought on three fronts, it is absolutely crucial we have an intelligent and objectively informed public.
But with today’s blurred line between news and entertainment, such a result becomes less and less likely.
Fox News’ decision to split with Beck could be an important first step in re-establishing the news network as a source of truly ‘Fair and Balanced’ news.
Beck is entertaining. Just don’t call him news.

this article sounds highly rational to me. Thanks .
I have a theory. Maybe pressure from DC was too much for Fox News. I’m sure that after all of Beck’s “conspiracies” happen to come to pass and expose our politicians for the wolves they are, the White House is gunning for Beck. Mr. Beck is called insane, theatrical, and a huckster, but one thing they cant call him…wrong.
I’m confused: is this article news or opinion? I don’t have the discernment to figure it out by myself without the aid of Government-mandated warning labels. These raging debates can be so complex!
Suni Ellis
So, Beck’s opinions getting out are “dangerous”? Wow, talk about pot and kettle. Do you not read your articles after you write them? Do you not see your bias bleeding through this article? I guess viewers are too stupid to discern opinion from fact without a comedy central logo in the corner? But, like all good liberals, you support all forms of free speech except political speech or religious speech you don’t agree with.

Though The Raveonettes’ name might not sound familiar to music listeners, TV enthusiasts have likely heard the band’s unique harmonies and playful sounds in such places as Kmart ads and Gossip Girl.
Photo courtesy of Big Hassle
Happy-go-lucky and TV-friendly as the duo of Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo might seem, listening to any Raveonettes album reveals many more layers.
The Raveonettes’ latest release, Raven in the Grave, proves the band’s ability to make you dance and think, with an array of uncategorized sounds that make the band a consistently good listen.
In nine tracks, The Raveonettes gives you enough to latch on to and reflect on.
With heart-wrenching chords and more than enough crisp beats to keep your head bouncing, the band’s tracks prove quality, not length, is what matters.
It’s hard to find a filler track here. Instead of competing with each other, each track presents a different layer of musicality and emotional tenderness.
The light sounds in “War in Heaven” throw you off guard with a sensitive sprinkling of sound.
The rougher guitar sounds burst in and hint at something darker before Foo’s breathy voice says wait, and the notes go back to a soft, lulling sound.
To top it all off,  a confident, soulful drum beat and a bridge of descending keyboard notes render lyrics unnecessary.
Halfway through the song, it’s as if you’re waiting for something to happen — but then you realize the crux of the song is this feeling of waiting.
Here, overly emotional lyrics are traded for subtle hints of chemistry between instrumentals that manages to be emotionally stirring.
If ever there were a song that would make you dance along while someone sang of possible pedophilia, The Raveonettes has crafted it.
“Forget That You’re Young” takes advantage of Foo’s sweet, swooning voice and couples it with soft guitar strumming to make you forget about the suspicious subject matter at hand.
The band takes three minutes to progress through an entire relationship, using repetition in a melodic way and playing with the line can I fall awake now? to point out the touching, yet unrealistic and disturbing mindset of the speaker, who is both kissing and hurting someone before admitting and I forget that you’re young.
Alternating between and I know that you are young and and I forget that you’re young, The Raveonettes makes us listen to the track and wonder if this is pedophilia at its sweetest or simply an exclamation of love to a younger child or sibling.
If you’re looking for darker material, “Apparitions” paints a much different picture, though with the same effective drums that came in “War in Heaven.”
Wagner sings about being jacked up on life and hell in a track that takes on almost MGMT-like vocals.
Again, the band turns you topsy-turvy when Foo’s voice breaks up the darkness with the lines let’s get out of here / want you to come along, lyrics that are simple but become a strange entreaty when sung by Foo.
The entirety of Raven in the Grave makes it seem like Foo and Wagner had no difficulty creating these tracks.
Sounding like one long, unwinding jam session, the album gracefully concludes with “My Time’s Up,” a track that encapsulates the style of both the album and the unique duo itself.
Each Raveonettes track, including this one, creates musicality and harmonies that are soothing yet at times uncanny, hinting at an unsettling tone that refuses to let the listener passively enjoy the tracks.
Because of this, Raven in the Grave is not an easy listen.
Though the duo’s off-beat sound might throw you off-guard, it’s this very sound that keeps the band from disappearing into the background.
“Though The Raveonettes’ name might not sound familiar to music listeners”
I vehemently disagree. If you know anything about music, you know who they are.
“the raveonettes creates”? that can’t possibly be how you conjugate it. you wouldn’t say “the beatles has many hits.”

Most students at private universities have heard the term “spoonfeeding.” It’s a condescending way of referring to the many extra perks — from small classes to free printing — that private schools provide.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
There’s a study abroad version of the private school experience, too.
If you want to study abroad through USC, you have three main options: doing a direct exchange with a foreign university, studying at an American university campus in a foreign country or signing up for a program that facilitates study abroad students.
If you’re lucky enough to be choosing between a few locations, it’s smart to figure out which of the options are available to you and what they each entail.
While abroad, being backed by a program is comforting. It provides a place to turn in especially sticky situations.
Programs that facilitate studying abroad, however, can sometimes go too far in their efforts to make things easy on students.
Studying abroad should be fun, but it should also be a learning experience; universities can’t justify sponsoring tourist vacations.
Although study abroad programs should not leave students unsupported, they should focus less on giving students short cuts and more on exposing them to the host country.
My current program in Amsterdam is a fantastic one, and I’m almost 100-percent satisfied. There are times, however, when I still feel spoonfed.
In Amsterdam, you can get virtually anywhere on two wheels, so it’s smart to buy a bike. On my first day, program staff escorted us to a rental bike store, where most of us purchased shiny new bikes, to be returned for cash at the end of the semester.
Many people assumed this was the smartest option — perhaps the only option.
The problem was, our bikes were so new and shiny three were stolen almost immediately (and a few more since then).
We have since learned that in this city, it’s smarter to buy cheap, rusty bikes that attract less attention. It’s a lesson we could have easily put to use if we weren’t directed to a rental store on our very first day.
Whenever I double-lock my gleaming bike, I feel less like a local and more like a tourist. That’s not a good mindset if you’re supposed to be truly  immersing yourself somewhere for five months.
I also sense some spoonfeeding in a class I’m taking through the program.
It’s a beginner’s Dutch class and half a crash course in cultural understanding. Learning Dutch has been helpful: I’ve found myself proudly pronouncing impossible-looking words (try “alstublieft” for fun) and reading ingredients in grocery stores. The language portion makes perfect sense, as knowing even basic phrases helps me immerse myself in the day-to-day life of the chosen country.
But the culture portion? Some days, I call it “Not Embarrassing Yourself For Dummies.”
For example, we’ve received papers outlining the so-called basic Dutch mentality — not in essays, but in simple sentences. We’re encouraged to write about what we think the Dutch mentality is, too, but papers like that impose an instant artificial framework.
That might be useful for a businessperson who’s studying in the Netherlands for a week, but we’re here for a semester.
We should be given freedom to understand the mentality of a foreign culture ourselves, with as few preconceived notions as possible.
The process would likely involve more awkwardness and frustration,  but we would come out of it feeling far more independent — and more equipped to deal with that awkwardness and frustration.
Plus, how large is the difference between perceiving the Netherlands through an American lens and perceiving it through a Dutch lens constructed by Americans?
There are ways for study abroad programs to provide learning experiences without handing students information on a silver platter.
For example, my program has organized trips to areas of the Netherlands many of us would have probably neglected otherwise.
We had time to explore the new cities on our own. We were given a few suggestions, but we were not given detailed information on how these places were different from Amsterdam, our home base.
I found it was a pleasure to spot the differences myself.
The services programs provide vary by region. Eastern Europe is not Western Europe, and Western Europe certainly isn’t Africa.
But programs shouldn’t go too far beyond providing region-appropriate safety nets.
Why hand students manuals when you can help them write their own?

Fighting climate change as a college student can mean anything from tracking down the lone recycling bin in your dorm to buying a Prius to simply signing whatever environmental petition happens to be circling campus that day.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Of course, some students take it a step further.
This weekend, college students from across the nation will congregate in Washington, D.C. for the Energy Action Coalition’s annual Power Shift Conference. Here, students will learn about green jobs, clean energy and the most efficient ways of implementing clean energy resources on college campuses.
The conference, which focuses specifically on fighting climate change, will draw some 10,000 students — including at least one from USC.
Tony Guan, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and an intern for USC’s Beyond Coal Campaign, said he signed up for the D.C. trip because he feels he will learn the leadership skills necessary to help expand the movement against climate change at USC.
Guan and his fellow climate-conscious students will participate in what the Power Shift website describes as a four-day clean-energy “boot camp.” The group will listen to such renowned speakers as Al Gore and will wrap up the trip to D.C. with a massive rally at the capitol building.
“It’s an incredible way to network with other students and see what we can each be doing at our own campuses,” Guan said. “Not enough is being done [to fight climate change] at USC right now, so things like this help raise awareness and student participation.”
He makes a valid point. The Beyond Coal Campaign, for example, has convinced 16 universities across the country — from Case Western Reserve University to Cornell University, and most recently Miami University of Ohio — to go coal-free.
But according to Henry Symons, USC’s Beyond Coal Organizer for the Sierra Club, the university is still not coal-free and currently has no plan or timeline to become so.
This is where student participation comes in.
“The most effective method for students is to actually work locally in the area where they have the most political power,” Symons said. “That means on university campuses … Students have a tremendous amount of power there.”
This year alone, USC’s chapter of the campaign has collected 2,500 signatures on a petition for the campus to go coal-free. Symons believes if this continues, it will not only make the issue increasingly difficult for the USC administration to ignore, but will also educate people and emphasize the role college students can play in clean-energy reform.
The bottom line is college students are among those with the most potential to influence energy policy, whether on campus or on the national level.
Conferences like Power Shift highlight the unique position the college student demographic holds in the push for energy reform.
Campuses use incredible amounts of energy and seem ideal for clean-energy innovation.
Most of all, universities facilitate the convergence of brainpower necessary to fuel a conference like Power Shift.
USC might not be the greenest university, but that only means organizations such as the Beyond Coal Campaign and the Sierra Club are looking for students with fresh ideas, and that conferences like Power Shift are ready to educate students looking to move our own campus forward.
Why not take advantage of that?

Between her new album and the debate over the opening act for her tour, Britney Spears has once again been the highlight of pop-culture news as of late. Her latest venture? Collaborating with Rihanna for an even more scandalous remix of “S&M.”  The pop-diva fusion aired this morning on the New York City radio station Z100.
Rihanna took a cue from her fans when approaching the collaboration. Devout followers pleaded for Spears and thus she delivered, stating on her Twitter, “I got a #SEXY collabo comin your way supa dupa soon!!!! OH YEAH!!! By popular demand.” The pop-sensation told Z100 morning host, “in order to do a remix, it had to be major,” and major it is.
The song remains fairly true to the original apart from Spears taking over a few verses and adding in a few bits like the repeated “nah nah nah nah nah come on.”
Spears’ distinct voice and iconic Queen of Pop status combined with Rihanna’s rising star power, however, makes this duo worth a listen.
Which do you prefer, the original or the diva sensation remix?

A study conducted by USC Professor and senior  author Caleb Finch found that freeway pollution resulted in  significant neuron damage for mice.
This was the first study to explore the physical  effect of freeway pollution on brain cells.
In the study mice were exposed to a synthetic  combination of floating freeway matter. The mice were exposed for up to 15 hours per  week, which is similar to the experience of L.A. commuters, who may spend up  to three hours per day on the freeway.
The results were the same for neurons in test tubes  as in the live mice: brain cells showed damage to learning and memory, signs  of premature aging and stunted cell growth.
“ You can’ t see them, but they are inhaled and have an effect on brain neurons that  raises the possibility of long-term brain health consequences of freeway air,”  Finch told the Los Angeles Times.
The pollutive particles may be invisible, but the  health risk is still readily apparent to USC students.
“When I came to L.A. from NorCal I immediately  noticed the difference in air quality,” said Alicia Anguiano, a junior majoring in political  science and history. “Sometimes going north on the 110 towards downtown I can’ t  even see the skyline — it’ s covered in smog. And I just think, it can’ t be  healthy for kids to grow up in this environment.”
Solutions to the problem are hard to find,  according to Finch, because even if we decrease the local concentration of these  particles, we live in a larger environment that contributes to the pollution  anyway.

With comedienne-driven Bridesmaids hitting theaters next month, producer Judd Apatow hopes to continue a long career in comedy. We here at the Daily Trojan want to review his career and give you his highlights.
 
Heavy Weights (1995) Executive Producer
If you haven’t seen this classic ‘90s comedy that features a juiced Ben Stiller and a legion of overweight children, be ashamed. Get your candy and popcorn out, because this heartfelt film about kids with hearty appetites that get sent to “Fat Camp” will leave you satisfied.
Freaks and Geeks (TV Series 1999-2000) Producer
This charmingly sad, short-lived series may have not have had the pleasure of having more than one season, but it featured future stars Linda Cardellini, James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason Segel.
Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) Producer
Yes, you see Jason Segel’s bare butt within the first 10 minutes and an adorable Mila Kunis frolic around Hawaii. Take an on-point Russell Brand and an appropriately hateable Kirsten Bell accompanied with a genius script, and you’ve got one of the most quotable movies of the past decade.
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) Producer
Will Ferrell gives the performance of his life as a narcissistic San Diegan newsman, complete with mustache and mustard suit. Add in an a capella version of “Afternoon Delight” and cinema’s most awesome cartoon interpretive sex scene and you’ve got comedy gold.
