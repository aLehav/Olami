Amid political polarization reinforced by algorithms and disinformation running rampant, The Olive Newsletter at USC has created an Instagram platform to combat these forces by showcasing a variety of perspectives.
“Recently, we’ve switched from a newsletter format to a social media format because we feel like it’s a bit easier to read, but second of all, we just think that it can probably get more exposure, especially given the boom of both advocacy and politics that seems to have sprouted up on social media,” said Rafael Xu, an Olive team member and a senior majoring in political economy and philosophy, politics and law.
The Olive is a project that stems from Novus Think Tank, a USC student think tank that focuses on social change projects. Since 2018, The Olive was formatted as an email newsletter that described politically pressing issues, provided information and links to the sources used, and sent useful articles for people to read. 
Today, they still focus on pressing and polarized topics, demonstrate different perspectives and provide reliable sources, but the format has transitioned entirely over to Instagram. 
Their recent post addressed the idea of cancel culture. The first slide defines the issue itself and  the post goes on to explain its current relevance, the pros and cons, the reasoning for both viewpoints and the sources and resources used — all presented with purple colored simple graphics.
In Fall 2018, several individuals within Novus Think Tank, including Xu, decided to create The Olive Newsletter because political polarization was becoming a very prevalent issue at the time, particularly after the 2016 presidential election.
“We realized that polarization seems to be something that was not only increasing, but also really damaging towards both civil discussion amongst people and political conversation amongst people, as well as the actual political process itself, so we were trying to come up with ways that we could, in a way, address political polarization,” Xu said. 
The goal behind demonstrating different opinions is to create productive conversations that include listening to and attempting to understand the mindset and assumptions that come from a particular opinion.
Freshman Amy Pang, one of the students who works on The Olive, thinks the organization’s power comes from its objectivity in a media world she believes can lack this quality. 
“We really want to make our content objective and able to tell different sides of each story without bias. And so people can use our content and our posts as a tool to better navigate media in a really polarized time,” said Pang, who is majoring in economics and international relations.
One of their upcoming projects includes hosting media literacy campaigns and workshops. They are currently conducting outreach to secure a guest speaker and start a campaign focusing on depolarizing mainstream news.
Neil McWhorter, a junior majoring in economics who helps with The Olive’s social media, was inspired to work on the team because he found political polarity to be a serious problem within the environment at USC as well. 
“There’s a lack of listening, and I found that problem was very strong at USC. I also found political apathy was strong at USC and so I’ve always thought that information and providing a platform is the best way to [address this],” McWhorter said. 
The name for The Olive came from this mindset of promoting positive listening. The founders named it The Olive to encourage people to “extend an olive branch” to those with different viewpoints rather than cause polarization. 
Moving forward, The Olive team hopes to continue pushing the USC community to be more aware and engaged with political issues in a healthy and productive way.
“We will be having different kinds of events or different kinds of projects that are going to continue to engage this student populace politically and get them to think about that difficult question of ‘OK so that’s somebody’s opinion, what informs that opinion? What makes them think the way they do?’” Xu said.

Former USC men’s basketball associate head coach Anthony Bland violated NCAA ethical conduct rules when he accepted a $4,100 bribe from a business management company to influence student athletes, according to a decision released by the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions Thursday. 
However, despite the Committee’s determination, major penalties, such as a postseason ban, were not prescribed and are therefore unlikely to be levied against USC. 
Instead, the Committee recommended two years of probation, a $5,000 fine plus 1% of the men’s basketball program budget and a three-year show-cause order for Bland. 
Probation means that if the men’s basketball program violates other NCAA legislation within the two-year period, their probation period could be extended and additional sanctions applied. For Bland, the show-cause order means that any NCAA member school employing him must restrict him from any athletically related duties unless it shows cause as to why the restrictions should not apply.
Additional prescribed penalties, such as the reduction of two scholarships and cuts in the number of recruiting visits the team can allow, had already been self-imposed by USC during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years and were accepted by the committee, which praised USC for “exemplary cooperation” and for the “meaningful penalties” the school self-imposed.
The case, which gave rise to penalties, originated in September 2017 when FBI agents arrested Bland in connection with an indictment and federal criminal complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that Bland had accepted cash bribes from a professional sports agent in exchange for influencing student-athletes to retain the services of the agent’s management company when the student athletes entered the NBA. 
In 2019, Bland pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to commit bribery. As part of his plea deal with federal prosecutors, Bland acknowledged that he accepted a bribe during a July 2017 meeting with financial advisers and business managers in exchange for directing basketball players to retain their services.
“I agreed to receive payments in exchange for directing basketball players from the University of Southern California … to retain the services of certain financial advisors and business managers,” said Bland during his hearing in 2019. 
Bland’s July 2017 meeting, in addition to a second meeting in August 2017, violated NCAA rules because, according to the NCAA’s press release on the Committee’s decision, “athletics department staff members are prohibited from receiving benefits for facilitating or arranging a meeting between a student-athlete and an agent, financial advisor, or representative of an agent or advisor. Athletics staff members also are prohibited from representing, directly or indirectly, any individual in the marketing of their athletics ability or reputation to an agency and from accepting compensation for the representation.”
USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn issued a statement following the Committee’s decision. 
“We are thrilled this matter is now behind us, and our focus remains on being the most student-athlete centered program in the country,” Bohn said in the statement.

To label Art Therapy as merely a clothing brand would be a grave misinterpretation of the project. John Lytle, a sophomore majoring in design, began Art Therapy in quarantine last spring as a way to tell stories through the clothing and film he made. 
Between March and October 2020, Lytle designed and hand-sewed 13 original pieces, wrote and shot an original short film entitled “ART THERAPY vol. 1” that featured the clothes. Additionally, he created a comprehensive lookbook featuring the clothing collection. The project was almost entirely independent, besides working with collaborators on the film.
The idea for Art Therapy began before quarantine when Lytle took one of his drawings and sketched it as a print for a sweater. Although he was excited by the idea of making the sweater, the busyness of freshman year academics and social life didn’t lend much free time for other projects. But when the pandemic sent everyone home, Lytle found his opportunity. 
“If quarantine never happened, I wouldn’t have been able to do it, so I kind of saw the moment and saw the time I had and thought I should just do it,” Lytle said. 
The knitted sweater that began it all, aptly named “‘Art Therapy’ sweater,” appears at first glance to have an abstract pink and blue design, but upon closer inspection reveals the original drawing Lytle had created in ART-110. The image is of two people kissing in front of a landscape of rugged mountains. While it would be a sweet illustration, the girl’s eyes are wide open —– indicating tension in the relationship. 
“I went through a really bad breakup freshman year … I wanted to talk about it but not directly talk about it,” Lytle said. And that is the point of Art Therapy: to talk about things.
“It mainly revolves around narrative; that’s the most important aspect of it, and just trying to find interesting ways to tell stories … and make it as personal as I can, and do that through clothing,” Lytle said. 
While Lytle’s interest in making clothing began in high school, the film element he brought into the creation of Art Therapy was something new to him. Once he wrote the script, Lytle reached out to his high school friend Cole Swanson and USC freshman Jonah Mazer and asked them to help with the film. Swanson, a student at New York University majoring in film and television production, co-directed the film with Lytle. Mazer, a USC film production major, worked as the director of photography.
“We were really on the same page,” Swanson said. “It was just good synergy, good energy on set always.”
The short film, which runs a little less than 14 minutes, showcases the students’ art and film abilities. Though the film features the clothing Lytle made, it’s nothing like an advertisement campaign; it’s a work of art itself.
Lytle pulled inspiration from films such as “Dazed and Confused” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” both of which complement the 1980s style of his clothing. 
“I think ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ was a huge inspiration in terms of the pacing and what I wanted it to feel like,” Lytle said. “Kind of slow, not boring, but immersing you in a world.”
After drafting the script, Lytle, a Pasadena native, drove around California’s deserts looking for locations to shoot and landed at the town of Helendale. Located off Route 66, Helendale’s last census reports its population as 5,623.
“There’s this random lake in the middle of the desert and all these houses around it,” Lytle said about the town. “It was cool getting all those shots with the lake and also the desert and kind of rural aesthetic. It’s a weird place, it feels like this other world.” 
That eeriness is seeped into the plot of the film, as well. The story follows a struggling actor who, the film reveals halfway through, sexually assaulted multiple girls while in Hollywood. The film grows more abstract around the eight-minute mark, eventually crescendoing to a scene of hallucinatory violence.
The decision to make an antihero film was rooted in the same breakup that inspired the first drawing Lytle made for Art Therapy.
“[The film] does make you look yourself in the face and be like, ‘You [messed] up,’ and that’s what kind of led back to the relationship … looking back in ways I [messed] up and how it happened,” Lytle said. “Doing that through the trope of this failed actor felt like the best way to do it.” 
Though this was the first screenplay Lytle wrote, the collaborators had minimal edits upon reading the initial draft. When Lytle first sent Swanson the script, he was taken aback by Lytle’s ability to write.
“I was like ‘Wow, this is better than a lot of the stuff my peers write back at film school,’” Swanson said. “I wasn’t surprised, but it was cool to see that side of his brain at work. He’s a very creative individual, really a visionary in his own respect.” 
Along with this being his first film, Art Therapy was also Lytle’s first time designing and crafting a multiple-piece collection of clothing. Selin Aydin, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, was similarly surprised by seeing his new talents emerge last summer.
“He’s like a Renaissance man of sorts with photography, clothing, film, he does [graphic] design,” Aydin said. “It’s really cool to see his range.” 
As fellow Roski students, Aydin and Lytle have found that their personal art styles mesh well together, and Aydin collaborated with Lytle on the “Mammoth Suit” by painting a mountain onto the garment, expertly playing with perspective and the physical composition of the garment itself.
Other than Aydin’s contribution, Lytle designed and sewed all the clothes himself, working consistent eight-hour days throughout the summer. Michelle Lytle, Lytle’s mother, watched him work daily at their dining table and attested to his work ethic.
“He’s kind of a rare combination where he seems like he’s talented, but he’s also a really hard worker and smart and figures it out and he’s organized, so he’s not just some crazy artist,” Michelle Lytle said.
As a hard worker, Lytle has already started working on the next installment of Art Therapy for this summer. He is currently planning to hold an in-person, outdoors fashion show in late August and is calling the next collection Art Therapy 1.5. 
Art Therapy 1.5 will be much more abstract, with inspiration pulled from designers like Jean Paul Gaultier. Lytle is also looking to incorporate sustainability into the collection in creative ways. 
“It’s still going to be in that kind of psychedelic, kind of crazy, experimental style from the first movie and the clothing of the first film, but kind of take it up a notch and make it … a lot more experimentation, not as streetwear inspired. More high fashion,” Lytle said. 
While there won’t be an accompanying film for Art Therapy 1.5, Lytle plans on creating another narrative-driven collection in the future.
When asked if he’d like to work with Lytle on a film again, Swanson explained that though he rarely directs other people’s screenplays, he’d be happy to do another film for Art Therapy.
“He had a vision; I think that part of the reason I was so down to do it is because he really believed in the project and that was kind of enough for me to come on board, to see his passion for it,” Swanson said. “It’s very rare to see people really dedicated and committed to their craft.”

Who’s got two thumbs and is ready to finally watch professional sports in person?
This guy — or man, or woman or about every single sports fan from the 818 to the 323 and beyond.
Wow, it feels great to finally see fans in the stands in the City of Angels. 
No more cardboard cutouts, horrid artificial crowd noises and music blasting rudely to replicate fans going crazy. It’s been a long time coming, but it’s finally here.
There has been a dramatic change in the sporting landscape since all of Los Angeles could last attend live games.
The Lakers and Dodgers won the championship, the Clippers blew another 3-1 lead, both the Rams and the Sparks made playoff runs and the Chargers were the Chargers.
Everything seemed like it was back to normal. Except, well, it wasn’t.
There were no fans to shower the Lakers in glory and chant “MVP” for LeBron James during his magnificent playoff run. No fans to yell “MOOOOOOOKIE” after each outrageous catch from the Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts. And no fans to go absolutely berserk when both L.A. teams finally ended their respective droughts.
We couldn’t scream at the top of our lungs to Chavez Ravine during the final out of the World Series or count the seconds down as the Lakers clinched the NBA Finals. It was a lost year of L.A. sports glory. As vaccines roll out and cases decrease, Angelenos will hope to make up for the time lost in stadiums. 
Last Friday was just the opening act as the Dodgers received their rings in front of 15,036 fans.
The last time fans filled the stadium, they made noise for the wrong reasons — booing the Dodgers after their heartbreaking defeat in game five to the Washington Nationals in October 2019. 
However, Friday was a perfect way to welcome Dodger lifers who have been waiting 32 years to finally see another jewelry presentation. 
The impact that fans have simply cannot be underestimated, especially after the long year of sports we’ve grown accustomed to. 
No fans come close to L.A. ones. 
They juice you up when you’re playing fantastic and squeeze you dry whenever you’re in a drought. They boo, cheer, chant loudly and boldly, but most importantly, they illuminate the energy of a city bursting with proud sport franchises.
And it’s why they’re coming back at the right time, when both the Dodgers and the Lakers are vying to repeat as champions.
Of course, fans returning now is important for the Clippers too. They still need to prove their worth to the league and get over the hump of advancing past the second round of the playoffs.
But I’m not here to fool anyone, so let’s be honest — this is a Laker and Dodger town.
Both squads need the fans to carry them through the dark times and bumps in their road to repeat titles. 
Especially the Lakers, who will finally welcome fans Thursday night against their bitter rivals, the Boston Celtics. They also announced they’d be unveiling their 17th championship banner in the final game of the season — a magical moment for followers of the team.
The last time there were fans in Staples Center, the Lakers lost a tough one to the Brooklyn Nets, leaving a bitter taste in the mouth of fans in attendance and around the world.
They have the chance to redeem themselves and put on a show. But, the Lakers are slipping through the standings with injuries to both James and Anthony Davis, as well as occasional role players.
It’s been a rough couple of months, and with both stars inching closer to a return, fans could not be filling the seats at a better time. 
Even though the last year in L.A. sports was fulfilling, there was always a piece of the celebration missing. And now, with fans finally back, maybe the celebration will feel complete.

USC wrapped up its Bay Area road trip with a 5-0 victory against Cal Sunday. Sophomore midfielder Croix Bethune led the Trojans with three goals and an assist. Earlier in the weekend, USC’s game against Stanford resulted in a 0-0 draw. The Cal game was the Trojans’ first road victory this season, leading into their upcoming season finale against No. 3 UCLA Friday.
Sunday’s game saw 12 attempted shots by each team. But the Trojans were able to shoot nine of those on goal to Cal’s four. It was a remarkable game for senior forward Tara McKeown, who assisted on all of the Trojans’ three goals in the first half. 
USC is 4-0-1 in their last five games, marking their best five-game stretch of the season. The Bruins and Trojans met earlier this season in a non-conference matchup where the Trojans gave up a one-goal lead late in the game, resulting in a 2-2 draw in extra time. 
The Trojans are no stranger to extra time, as four of their games this season have required overtime. 
“We just approach [overtime] how we would throughout the regular game, but we make it a point to stay locked in defensively since a golden goal would win,” McKeown said. 
In conference play, the Trojans have kept up their extra defensive efforts in overtime, only falling once to Colorado. Overall, USC’s late-season defensive performance has been impressive, having not allowed a goal since the March 18 game against UCLA. 
However, the Bruins continue to be the Trojans’ toughest conference opponent. The Bruins just clinched their 12th Pac-12 Championship in their 3-1 victory against Cal last week. UCLA’s only loss this season came against Arizona State who defeated the Bruins 2-1 in overtime and also beat the Trojans earlier this season.
The Bruins are led by freshman forward Reilyn Turner and sophomore forward Mia Fishel, who accounted for 15 goals and seven assists in the season combined. UCLA has also put up 31 goals this season to USC’s 23. 
The Trojans will enjoy a home-field advantage on Friday. USC hasn’t lost a home game the entire season — allowing zero goals at home since the season opener against BYU. On the other hand, UCLA has dominated on the road, sporting a 6-0 record and only allowing three goals. 
Junior forwards Penelope Hocking and McKeown have been standout performers for the Trojans thus far. Hocking leads the Trojans with nine goals scored, while McKeown has added six goals of her own. The duo have been essential to the team’s success this season. 
“We’ve been friends for a while, even before college,” McKeown said. “That dynamic between us up top is good chemistry on and off the field, and knowing what each other wants to do and likes to do.” 
The game between USC and UCLA was a nail-biter last month, and the clash between each team’s impressive defensive units and standout forwards should provide another competitive match. Kickoff is at 4 p.m. and will stream on the Pac-12 Network.

The No. 15 men’s tennis team has performed well this season, holding an overall record of 16-6 and a conference record of 4-2. The team has three players in the top 100 singles players in the country with No. 26 senior Daniel Cukierman, No. 28 redshirt senior Riley Smith and No. 87 sophomore Stefan Dostanic. Additionally, Cuckierman and Smith are the No. 2 doubles team in the nation. 
The vast talent and depth of this squad have led the team to dominant wins against some of the best collegiate teams in the country, such as No. 7 TCU (4-0), No. 18 Oklahoma State (4-0) and No. 27 Arizona State (6-1). 
However, there have been some hiccups along the way. The Trojans had close calls at the ITA Indoor Championships and tight matches against No. 20 Arizona, Pepperdine and most recently Stanford. 
Now, the Trojans hope to finish the regular season on a high note with a chance to sweep their crosstown rivals, the UCLA Bruins. 
USC has faced the Bruins twice already Their first matchup was in the championship match for the ITA Kickoff Weekend when the Trojans were the No. 1 team in the nation. Even though UCLA took an early lead by winning the doubles point, the Trojans came back and swept the Bruins in singles play, for a final score of 4-1. 
During their second matchup, the final result ended up much closer, with USC earning a 4-3 win. USC won the doubles point but went down 3-1 in singles with some of USC’s top players like Cuckierman and Smith falling. However, USC rallied back to a win with freshman Lodewijk Weststrate winning 5-7, 6-4, 6-0 and then junior Jake Sands finishing the comeback when he went down one set and subsequently won the next two, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3. 
Sands is looking forward to playing the Bruins one more time this regular season, but isn’t getting ahead of himself despite the Trojans’ record. 
“We’re just kind of talking about the previous matches we played against them and studying them, just learning about our opponents,” Sands said. “But besides that, we are just going into it with a pretty motivated mindset even though we already beat them.” 
Sands has had a consistent season so far, always showing up for the squad when they need him. Recently, the junior made things close in the 3-4 loss against Stanford last Saturday. 
Despite his strong efforts so far this season, Sands still sees room for improvement moving into this final regular-season matchup and into the postseason. 
“I just want to keep building on my game,” Sands said. “The goal is NCAAs, the post-season coming up. Whether we win or lose [against UCLA] … isn’t going to be everything, so we just need to learn from what’s coming up and just to prepare ourselves for NCAAs.”
Sands and the Trojans will finish the regular season this Friday at 3 p.m. at David X. Marks Tennis Stadium at USC.

The Walt Disney Company, also known as Disney, is a U.S. multinational mass media and entertainment company known for its leadership in the animation industry. In many of their films, various adult topics such as gender equality and dealing with stereotypes have been the main focus, or at the very least, have been peripheral themes. 
Many of these subjects have been portrayed through the relationships between the main characters and the villains in these films. Toxic relationships are represented by showing both the subtle signs and consequences of gaslighting and online catfishers. 
These examples can be found in, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996),” “Tangled (2010)” and “Frozen (2013).” 
“The Hunchback of Notre Dame” revolves around the main character, Quasimodo, who was deformed as a baby and raised by Judge Claude Frollo, a minister of justice and the main villain in the story. Frollo only takes care of Quasimodo because of his religious beliefs; which does not stop him from naming Quasimodo after his deformity: hunchback. 
Manipulation from guardians results in Quasimodo being tricked into believing Frollo truly cares for him. This type of manipulation is called gaslighting (making someone question their sanity or memories) and is done through tactics such as lying.  
Frollo would constantly remind Quasimodo that he took care of him despite his deformity, even though the real reason was his belief that Quasimodo would be useful to him. Such manipulation can easily be executed as a result of Quasimodo being locked in and away from the world, relying only on Frollo’s words on how the entire world would be cruel to him. Frollo takes control of and limits Quasimodo’s outlook on life only for it to backfire on him in the end.
Some of the consequences of this mistreatment include Quasimodo’s lack of self-confidence as a result of Frollo’s actions. However, Frollo’s control of Quasimodo lessens when Quasimodo forms friendships with characters such as Esmeralda and Phoebus. These new friendships and Frollo’s manipulation result in Quasimodo finally expressing his rightful anger at everything Frollo has done. 
In regards to toxic relationships from guardians, “Tangled,” takes a similar approach. 
“Tangled” focuses on Rapunzel, a princess who, unknowingly, was kidnapped by Mother Gothel, an old woman who uses Rapunzel’s magic hair to make herself young. Like Frollo, Gothel gaslights Rapunzel through a variety of tactics. She tells Rapunzel lies about the dangers of the outside world, doesn’t let her leave, insults Rapunzel’s looks and maturity and ultimately scapegoats Rapunzel, taking none of the blame herself. 
Some of the direct consequences that result from this are Rapunzel leaving in secret,putting Gothel’s plans in danger and l questioning her sanity away from home. Gothel begins to be more affectionate through her kind gestures but only because Rapunzel has something that will benefit her — magical hair. This villain is set up well to display the signs and dangers of gaslighting. Of course, not all manipulation comes from the guardian figures in films. 
“Frozen” is a film that focuses on two princesses — Elsa, a recluse like Rapunzel and Quasimodo, and Anna, who is more extroverted. “Frozen” handles toxic relationships like “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” and “Tangled” but this time, it’s through Anna’s relationship with the twist villain, Hans, instead of a character who is withdrawn from everyone. 
Throughout the film, even when the manipulator can’t lock their victim away, they can still feign love to take advantage of them. Hans, for example, is similar to online catfishers who only pretend to like someone so they can take advantage of them. The film also shows how such people can adapt their manipulative tactics to those who are more open, like Anna. In the song, “Love is an Open Door,” Hans states he wants to find his own place but gestures toward Anna’s kingdom rather than Anna herself. 
When Anna learns the truth, she questions whether she would know what love is until reflecting on what her friends and her sister had given her. In essence, the film expresses how such things such as sisterly love can’t be forgotten while Hans is left with nothing in the end. A fitting punishment for his trickery. 
Each of these films emphasize the various signs and issues of manipulation that happen in real life and should be taken into account even if the films themselves serve as somewhat childish means of entertainment.

Last week, I watched the new environmental documentary on Netflix, “Seaspiracy.” And, as per usual, I have some thoughts. 
If you haven’t yet watched it, “Seaspiracy” details a British filmmaker’s investigation into the causes of marine plastic debris and overfishing occurring around the world. Ultimately, the argument is that commercial fisheries are at the heart of the decimation of marine ecosystems as we know them, and, to combat this, consumers must eat less fish. 
The documentarian, Ali Tabrizi, is totally correct in that commercial fishing practices have some huge issues that create a ripple effect across entire ecosystems. Overfishing for human consumption can disrupt the food chain, causing a trophic cascade as apex predators like sharks are left with nothing to eat. Trawling practices cause heavy equipment to be dragged across the seafloor, scraping up bottom-dwelling organisms and disrupting sediments, and decimating reefs, oysters and sponges that form habitats for other native species. Another problem, bycatch, is caused by using longline bait hooks or huge nets that unintentionally bring up other species, such as  turtles, birds, dolphins, manatees and sharks. More often than not, these animals either die or end up critically injured. Lastly, ghost fishing, or old fishing lines and lures floating around in the ocean, can ensnare fish and birds.
However, one of my biggest qualms with the claims in the documentary is the argument that we should all completely stop eating fish, which is largely ignorant; fish are critical for nutrition in vulnerable geographic areas around the world. Many coastal communities may not have a sustainable alternative in place or the privilege of even having a diet substitute for fish. Along with this, these seaside communities that rely on the ocean for sustenance don’t fall into the same categories as large-scale commercial fishing vessels, instead fishing for their families and their communities. Consequently, Tabrizi doesn’t discuss the link between larger fishing operations in international waters, stealing catch and potential revenues from local and often indigenous small-scale operations. 
The claim that anti-ocean plastic campaigns and marine nongovernmental organizations are conspiring with the capitalist greed of the fishing industry may be a bit much, but if you subtract the excessive pathos from the argument, it is incredibly important for conservation societies to further incorporate unsustainable fishing practices into their agenda. The exact percentage of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean as a result of fishing industries is debatable — Tabrizi states that it’s around 46% — but it’s a significant amount and makes the need for more responsible fishing methods clear. But what constitutes a sustainable fishing practice? 
Perhaps a good place to start with an issue this complex is to look at the global demand for fish. Fish account for about 40% of animals consumed worldwide. Species such as cod, pollock, halibut, salmon, tuna, seabass and shrimp are in high demand, with an estimated .97 to 2.7 trillion fish caught from the wild every year. This doesn’t even include farmed fish or larger species like sharks, whales, dolphins and turtles caught and killed as bycatch or for meat. Consequently, a third of global fish stocks would now be considered “overexploited,” that is, being caught at a rate that exceeds their ability to reproduce or replenish. There are simply fewer fish available in the ocean, and, for this reason, aquaculture practices are expanding. 
Aquaculture, or the cultivation of fish in a closed environment for human consumption, has high potential to keep up with the demand for seafood products. More effective fisheries management has the potential to reduce the burden on wild-fish catching and could alleviate stress on the marine ecosystem. Aquaculture has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any type of farming and could one day overtake commercial fishing practices on the high seas.
Tabrizi points to another incongruence in the relationship between corporations and consumers. We can easily go to the store, grab a can of certified dolphin-safe tuna, and pat ourselves on the back with our sustainable choice. However, these labels don’t necessarily guarantee anything; even the fisheries that are supposedly ‘certified’ can still harm dolphins in actuality. Many certifications aren’t much more than greenwashed, feel-good environmental movements for marketing purposes. Because of capitalist corruption, responsibility is placed in the hands of the consumers instead of big business. The label satisfies the buyer’s desire to make an ethical purchase without actually holding companies to any standards at all.
“Seaspiracy” relies on shock value, citing questionable big numbers and statistics and filming gory scenes of whales being killed off the coast of Japan and in the Faroe Islands, but isn’t necessarily the most informed about ocean ecosystems and the global food production system as a whole. Environmental protection is simply one element of an extremely complex system, which is oversimplified in the film. Many countries rely on fishing exports to boost their gross domestic product and local economies, not to mention feeding their families with the most convenient resource found. Additionally, lack of resources in some countries may mean that fishing vessels aren’t equipped to fish sustainably.
Scientific critics of the film contend that commercial fishing can be done responsibly. However, I would argue that the concept of ‘sustainability’ would do well to be redefined and specified. Oceans do have the capacity to replenish fish stocks if managed carefully as demand continues to grow. We’re at a crossroads: Can we invest in growing renewable aquaculture systems while also confronting our own subjection to capitalism? Providing economic alternatives to big-fishing nations is an uphill battle but perhaps worth it in the end. 
To be fair, it’s impossible to adequately cover all the intricacies of the ocean in a 1.5 hour long documentary, and the same holds true for this single article. Regardless, the lesson here is twofold. Firstly, the state of the world’s oceans is dire for a number of reasons, and malpractices in commercial fishing are only compounding existing problems. Second, when being presented with information about environmental issues, it’s key to analyze them with a critical eye. As we see in “Seaspiracy,” shocking facts thrown about casually may not be entirely correct, and many actors have ulterior, market-driven motives. Simply put, the reason these environmental issues are so difficult to solve is because of their multidimensionality — to understand the whole story, you need to look at the interests, needs and cultures of different groups around the world. 
Ultimately, “Seaspiracy” is just what its title implies — a conglomeration of loose scientific facts, carefully cropped interviews, accusations of conspiracy and a weak final argument. Instead of confronting the drastic systemic overhaul of food security and production and the much-needed revitalization of environmental valuation worldwide, “Seaspiracy” misses the mark. Tabrizi ignores the opportunity to confront the many shortcomings of capitalism head on, instead leaving us with the false claim that going vegan and altering our lifestyle choices will solve this global problem. 
It’s important to think critically about where our food is coming from and how ethically it was sourced and make changes wherever possible. But “Seaspiracy” only scratches the surface of a much harsher reality. Ultimately, capitalism determines our definition of sustainability and, consequently, the level of environmental degradation that society is willing to accept.
