Rock and Roll Hall of Fame released this year’s nominees Thursday morning, and the list includes a few names that you might not normally associate with rock music.
Legendary hip-hop groups N.W.A. and Public Enemy were both nominated in their first year of eligibility, and according to Spin.com they were the only acts to do so this year. In order to be eligible for the Hall of Fame ballot, artists must have released their first single or album at least 25 years before the date of nomination.
The German electronic group Kraftwerk also made the cut this year, possibly as a nod to the current near-takeover of the U.S. music business by electronic dance music. Kraftwerk are widely regarded as pioneers of electronic music after popularizing their revolutionary sound in the ’70s and early ’80s that combined driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies, a formula that today’s top EDM artists still follow.
Other diverse nominees include disco acts Donna Summer and Chic, Oscar winner Randy Newman, blues guitarist Albert King and Motown girl group The Marvelettes.
Rock and roll purists need not worry, though, as the list also includes rockers like Deep Purple, Rush, Heart and Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.
According to President and CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, Joel Peresman, the variety in this year’s nominees reflects the wide scope of the genre.
“The definition of ‘rock and roll’ means different things to different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music,” Peresman said. “This year we again proudly put forth a fantastic array of groups and artists that span the entire genre that is ‘rock and roll.’”
This also marks the first year that voting will be open to the public. Fans can vote at RollingStone.com until Dec. 3, and the top five vote-getters will comprise a “fan’s ballot” that will be counted amongst the 600-plus ballots from an international voting body of artists, historians and members of the music industry.
The 28th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony will be held at the Nokia Theatre in L.A. Live on April 18, 2013.

We are all aware of Apple’s flawless track record when it comes to creating new gadgets. Their web services, however, have not fared quite so well. Now, with the demise of the company’s social media experiment, Ping, Apple is finally acknowledging its own deficiencies. In choosing to integrate with preexisting social networks Facebook and Twitter instead, they are making a worthy sacrifice.
With the notable exception of iTunes, Apple has a history of rudderless web-based services and software. Just last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook issued an apology for the poor quality of Apple’s “half-baked” Maps app. MobileMe, Apple’s original cloud storage system, was scrapped earlier this year. And finally, on Sept. 30, Apple quietly shut down its music based social media service, after years of disinterest and mockery by iTunes users.
The unpopularity of Ping had a lot to do with the poor first impression it made on these users. While limited numbers of artists within the hub occasionally provided useful information, Ping’s limiting of music samples to 30 seconds and excessive commercialization was a big turn-off. Users were not even able to connect with friends or comment on their iTunes playlists.
With the latest version of iTunes, personal iTunes libraries will be linked with Facebook and Twitter accounts. Users will be able to “Like” and “Share” music, apps, books and podcasts. iTunes will also be able to actively compete with free on-demand music streaming services like Spotify and Pandora, which have been siphoning away its users, especially those in younger demographics. The new integration features function similarly to Spotify, with iTunes activity appearing in the ticker and on people’s timelines.
This new strategy is an obvious step forward for Apple that will not only delight iTunes fans but also the independent developers who will now have a more robust network in which to promote their apps.
Apple may have tried its best, but Ping could not compete with the world’s most popular social network. As it turns out, users weren’t interested in limiting their social connections to the iTunes universe.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary on Wednesday, Oct. 3.
 
Crimes against a person
At 4:35 p.m., two suspects approached both sides of a vehicle  in which two students were seated and demanded their wallets while simulating a weapon and brandishing a tire iron at Livingston Research Annex. One of the students complied, but the second student stated that he did not have a wallet. The suspect with the tire iron attempted to open the passenger side door to search the student and smashed the window with the tire iron when the student pulled the door closed. Both suspects then fled on foot and they could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers and sheriff’s deputies.
Crimes against property
at 2:00 p.m., a student reported that he arranged to sell his laptop computer to a suspect at Carl’s Jr. The student was given an envelope containing currency in exchange for it. After the suspect drove away the student checked the envelope and determined that it contained only a fraction of the price for which he agreed to sell his computer.
at 10:53 a.m., a staff member reported receiving an email message from a suspect attempting to extort money from her in exchange for him not fulfilling a contract to harm her.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:15 p.m., a non-USC female reported that she injured her knee when she tripped and fell outside the Keck Hospital of USC. The female sought medical treatment on her own.
The old hot Carl in the envelope trick.   Will you kids ever learn?

USC jumpstarted a new year of fundraising for its Good Neighbors Campaign, a program started by former USC President Steven Sample that aims to support the communities surrounding the university’s two campuses, on Tuesday.
The campaign encourages faculty and staff to contribute portions of their paychecks to a fund called the USC Neighborhood Outreach program.
Each year, the USC Good Neighbors Campaign and the Neighborhood Outreach fund have a goal of raising more than $1 million to support programs that enhance educational opportunities, promote neighborhood safety and job opportunities and encourage healthy lifestyles in the surrounding areas.
Last year, faculty, staff, students and outside donors gave an average of $253 each to raise a record-breaking $1.5 million, exceeding the pre-year goal by $100,000. This success was due in part to the creation of an online donation platform, now a major trend in nationwide philanthropy that makes donating easier and greener.
This year, the campaign aims to raise $1.6 million, which would trump last year’s success by $100,000.
Though the Good Neighbors Campaign accepts donations any time during the year, the official campus-wide campaign runs during the month of October, according to Cesar Armendariz, communications director of the campaign.
Armendariz, who also serves as director of community outreach at the Health Sciences Campus, explained that the campaign not only raises money but also pairs USC faculty, staff and student organizations with community groups to create programs that make a change in the surrounding area.
“It’s one thing to give money, but it really helps for faculty to see the impact firsthand,” Armendariz said.
Armendariz works for the campaign and each year contributes 1 percent of his salary to the fund. He also personally received grants each year to fund a community health fair in the fall and a science education fair for fifth graders in the spring.
“At the science fair, our medical and pharmacy students become mentors for the children,” Armendariz said. “I can assure you that the money is going to good use because I’ve seen both sides of it.”
One of the chief beneficiaries of UNO is The 32nd Street USC Magnet School, which aims to set all its students on a path to USC. Students from kindergarten to eighth grade at the school focus on performing and visual arts, while the high school is aimed toward improving math, science and technology skills. Its arts curriculum has produced successful performers such as actor Shia LaBeouf.
“We are trying to create a project-based, hands-on learning environment,” said Victor Sanchez, who facilitates USC programs at The 32nd Street School. “But the school’s enriching programs depend on an ongoing relationship with USC and its student volunteers.”
One of the school’s most valued enrichment programs comes from the USC Thornton School of Music’s Outreach Program, which not only puts on special concerts and events, but also organizes undergraduate and graduate students to teach weekly music lessons to local elementary school students. The Thornton Outreach Program depends heavily on GNC funds to pay for materials, transportation and special events.
“For the last 10 years, education funding has been cut back and back and back, especially for arts instruction,” said Susan Helfter, director of community outreach at Thornton. “Without these funds, our music programs simply would not run.”
According to Sanchez, GNC and UNO has had a tremendous impact on The 32nd Street School by connecting elementary students with sorority houses to paint pumpkins together for Halloween, starting a debate team and organizing art shows at the school.
“What makes us unique as a school is that while other schools might use student volunteers as an opportunity to get rid of a student who has behavioral problems, we strategically place students in those special programs who are potentially gifted and who can really benefit from them,” Sanchez said.
GNC has also helped fund Troy Camp, a student-run volunteer organization that mentors elementary school students through sporting events and field trips.
“[UNO] is one of our biggest sources of money. Troy Camp is completely free for campers, so we really depend on our fundraising efforts,” said Michael Lin-Brande, a senior majoring in business administration who served as the grant-writer for Troy Camp last year.
Sanchez explained that Troy Camp has introduced his school’s students to enriching experiences they normally couldn’t afford, which in the long run helps them academically.
“When I asked one of our students what he spent his summer doing, he said he visited his brother in prison,” Sanchez said.
Since its inception in 1994, GNC has raised more than $12.5 million  to fund more than 400 groups like Troy Camp that collaborate with USC to put local children on the path to a college education and to alleviate safety and health problems in the community.
The effort has expanded from contributions by faculty and staff to include donations from students, as well.
Though some students cannot afford to make a financial donation, Armendariz encouraged students to promote the campaign by encouraging their professors to donate or by getting involved in the beneficiary organizations themselves.

Two former solicitors general and a professor from the Gould School of Law came together Thursday to discuss the U.S. Supreme Court’s last term and what to expect in the Court’s current session, which began Monday.
Arguments · Paul Clement, a solicitor general under President George W. Bush, and Walter Dellinger, a solicitor general under President Bill Clinton, participate in a panel about the Supreme Court’s recent and upcoming cases. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Panelists for Gould’s fifth annual “U.S. Supreme Court: A Preview” included former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, former acting U.S. Solicitor General Walter Dellinger and USC Newton Professor of Constitutional Law Rebecca Brown. The discussion was moderated by USC Provost Professor and Rader Family Trustee Chair Lee Epstein.
Epstein opened the discussion with a look at what the Court accomplished in its last term.
“We, and especially I, would love to hear the panelists’ views on the future of the courts against the backdrop of the upcoming presidential election,” Epstein said.
The first portion of the panel began with highlights from the Supreme Court’s last term, including the recent Supreme Court case decision on the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature legislation. The Court upheld the law 5-4, with the deciding vote cast by Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote that the president’s individual mandate was constitutional as a tax.
All three panelists broke down the complex decision, which centered on the two major components of the law — the mandate and the Medicare expansion. Brown began with an overview of the individual mandate, noting three important ramifications of the decision: what the court did, what the implication for the state of the law is and what can be learned from the court’s decision.
Clement voiced concern regarding the law as a tax as opposed to a mandate.
“I’m not sure the law will be as effective,” Clement said. “Most people are law-abiding, so when you tell them they have a federal obligation to get insurance, they go do it. But if you tell them there is a tax for not having insurance, they’re going to ask how much the tax is and how much the insurance premium is and compare.”
Clement and Dellinger are both firsthand authorities in the Affordable Care Act debate. The two lawyers played roles in arguing the case before the Supreme Court. Dellinger filed a brief on behalf of the law and Clement represented the states challenging the act. The panelists, however, shared doubt over the effectiveness of the tax.
Janille Chambers-Corbett, a first-year student at the USC Gould School of Law, thought the event brought about a thoughtful discussion.
“The panel was really diverse,” Chambers-Corbett said. “They took the points of the health care bill and broke them down in a way that I could understand and gave me background that I had no knowledge of.”
The panelists also discussed the future of pivotal cases that might appear in the Supreme Court’s docket, including a case that challenges the Defense of Marriage Act, which Clement is defending.
“I think it’s going to be very difficult for the court not to take the DOMA case,” Clement said. “When the Court of Appeals strikes down an act of Congress as unconstitutional, the court will generally take that case up.”
Clement, who is actively involved in defending DOMA before the Supreme Court, predicts that the court will be hearing the case.
“The court is quite likely to take the DOMA case,” Clement said.
The discussion also spent time discussing an affirmative action case in the court’s docket, Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin. The case was brought by Abigail Fisher, an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin in 2008, who challenged UT Austin’s affirmative action policy. The policy allows that factors of race, religion and gender be considered in admission decisions.
The panel discussed how the court will have to determine whether its interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and its 2003 decision in the case of Grutter v. Bollinger allows for UT Austin to use race as factor in its undergraduate admission decisions. Dellinger said the court’s decision to take the case is an indication that the university’s affirmative action might be overruled.
“The Texas program seems so molded after the University of Michigan,” Dellinger said. “I think the only reason the conservatives of the court would take this case is if they were prepared to overrule the University of Michigan Law School case in either one step or two.”
Clement said the fact that the court will be hearing Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin should make affirmative action supporters at uneasy.
“For those that were fans of the diversity of affirmative action, I think it’s time to be nervous again,” Clement said. “This was not a case that the Supreme Court had to take. This was a case that they went out of their way to take.”
[…] it’s going to be very difficult for the court not to take the DOMA case,” Clement said, as quoted by the USC Daily Trojan. “When the Court of Appeals strikes down an act of Congress as unconstitutional, the court will […]

USC’s Marshall School of Business announced Thursday a new master’s program tailored to military personnel, titled the Master of Business for Veterans.
The yearlong program, which will begin in Fall 2013, will focus on integrating veterans into the corporate world by honing skills the veterans acquired through their service in the military.
Karla Wiseman, assistant dean and executive director of Marshall’s Executive Education, said school officials believe the business world can benefit from the traits that veterans have.
“Veterans can offer a great deal of leadership, can handle a great deal of pressure under situations and are good at problem solving,” Wiseman said.
The Master of Business for Veterans program aims to transition veterans from military life back into civilian life by aiding them with formal business knowledge.
The program will teach veterans useful skills for business, including critical thinking, management, marketing and finance.
“I think a lot of corporations are interested in hiring veterans because of the skills they learn in the military,” Wiseman said. “This program will provide them with the language needed to maneuver in business.”
Marshall officials said they are motivated to increase the breadth of their graduate programs and believe that the veterans are a key group to target.
This is the first graduate program offered by the business school that is specifically for veterans.
“This is an important program for Marshall, serving a population that has provided outstanding service to our country while creating valuable leaders and managers for the corporate community,” said Marshall Dean James G. Ellis in a statement.
Because California has many military stations, the state has a large population of active-duty personnel and veterans. According to U.S. census figures, more than 2 million veterans live in the state.
