After a frustrating 8-3 loss to No. 2 California in early March, recent weeks have been kinder to the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team.
Since the Women of Troy’s five-point defeat, they have notched five consecutive victories.

Before a showdown against No. 1 Stanford at home Saturday, USC (14-3) will welcome unheralded Hartwick to McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
But even without a high ranking in the polls, the Hawks have won 15 straight games following a 14-5 win over Pomona-Pitzer on Tuesday.
The Women of Troy are also surging, coming off weekend wins over No. 20 Maryland (16-7), and No. 6 Loyola Marymount (13-8).
The team seems to be getting back to its normal self after consecutive losses to Stanford and California in early March, with an array of goal-scoring contributers in recent matches.
The Women of Troy punched in 16 goals against Maryland, and those goals came from 10 different girls.
They also used eight scorers to notch 13 against LMU, improving their offensive attack.
“When we played Maryland last week, we were leading just 5-3 after two quarters. Hartwick has beaten Maryland, so we have to work on Hartwick,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic.
Vavic believes one of the biggest challenges facing the Women of Troy on Wednesday will be dealing with the unusual strategy Hartwick uses throughout its games.
“They are a very well coached team, we played them last year and it was a good game. They do some unorthodox things. They play really different than many California schools,” Vavic said. “Hartwick runs different plays, likes to play trick plays and they surprise people that aren’t ready for them. We’re going to play an intense game and focus on our game when we’re down a man and up a man.”
With an unknown opponent, at least to some degree, the Women of Troy know they cannot overlook anybody, especially with a big matchup against Stanford looming.
“We’re trying to take this week as a challenge, and I think it’s good to have a game tomorrow,” said senior driver Joelle Bekhazi. “We’re going to get the kinks out for Stanford and it’ll just be an opportunity for us to prepare even more.”
The Women of Troy are confident about both their games this week, especially because both are home games.
“It really helps because just being familiar, being in your own pool, everything is more comfortable so it’ll be a lot better for us,” Bekhazi said. “Having our fans here will really help us out. Stanford is coming to our pool, and we’re going to show them that we are USC.”

The defense set the tone and dominated practice once again Tuesday morning.
Particularly notable was the rise of senior safety and returning starter T.J. McDonald, who has provided an increased level of vocal leadership.
“T.J. is taking it to the next level right now,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin.
The defensive domination included interceptions by redshirt sophomore linebacker Will Andrew and redshirt freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard.
“Will Andrew has had an interception every day so far,” Kiffin said. “And we have a long way to go, but eventually I would love to rotate more defensive players in throughout games.”
With McDonald and sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey entrenched as returning starters, competition for the other spots has heated up.
“[Junior safety] Jawanza Starling has come out with a lot of focus,” Kiffin said. “He took a demotion last year and is looking good now.”
Last year, a lack of depth on both sides of the ball kept the Trojans out of tackling drills during the fall, resulting in missed tackles during games.
Now, the team is learning from its mistakes.
“We’re translating from the film room to the field very well,” McDonald said. “Coach is putting us in great positions and we’re executing.”

Redshirt freshman tailback D.J. Morgan practiced Tuesday morning, returning from a tweaked knee that kept him out of last week’s practice.
“I need to get my knee ready from a mental standpoint,” Morgan said. “Learning the plays will help me mentally overall. And my knee feels good; not 100 percent, but I’m hoping to really start planting on it soon.”
With senior tailback Marc Tyler out of practice with a hamstring injury, Morgan, sophomore Dillon Baxter and junior Curtis McNeal received the bulk of the repetitions at tailback.
“We had a good day from McNeal today, especially on special teams,” Kiffin said. “And D.J. Morgan has had good flashes.”

The offensive line has only two returning starters, junior tackle Matt Kalil and junior guard Khaled Holmes.
Guard Butch Lewis and center Kristofer O’Dowd have graduated and tackle Tyron Smith has entered the NFL draft.
This season, Holmes will move to center to provide a veteran anchor for an otherwise young unit.
“It’s tough replacing such an experienced group up front,” Holmes said. “But I’m working as hard as possible and I feel like I’m starting to come along.”

Former USC coach Mike Gillespie got his first glimpse of the scoreboard named in his honor Tuesday, and chances are he liked what he saw.
Gillespie and UC Irvine lit up the scoreboard against the Trojans, and Irvine starter Matt Whitehouse threw four and two-thirds shutout innings, no walks and four strikeouts, to lead  the Anteaters (15-6) to a 4-0 victory over the Trojans (9-16).
Not enough · Junior centerfielder Garret Houts had two of the Trojans’ seven hits Tuesday, but failed to drive in any runs against UC Irvine. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Gillespie remains one of the most accomplished and renowned coaches in USC history. He won 763 games at the helm of the Trojans and led them to 15 postseason appearances, four College World Series appearances and a national championship in 1998. The Trojans recently named the Dedeaux field scoreboard the Mike Gillespie scoreboard.
Tuesday wasn’t the first time Gillespie had been at USC since leaving, however. Gillespie has been the coach at Irvine since 2007 and has taken on the Trojans every year since, beating them six out of eight times coming into this season. Now, it’s seven of nine.
While the Trojans came in having lost five of six games, the Anteaters had also lost five of six, including four in a row.
But they came out firing.
The Anteaters put men on in each of the first four innings against freshman Kyle Richter, who was making his first career start on the mound.
The promising southpaw got out of the first with a double play, then ended the second with a strikeout to strand a pair. He was lifted after a leadoff walk in the third for senior righthander Chris Mezger.
Mezger balked the runner to second, but managed to hold the Anteaters to just one run on a sacrifice fly.
Visibly dismayed by his team’s struggles, USC interim coach Frank Cruz could only muster a few words about his freshman.
“Richter pitched alright,” he said.
Irvine’s Whitehouse went four and two-thirds shutout innings, retiring the Trojans in order in the first, second and fourth before being lifted in the fifth after a pair of two-out singles.
The Anteaters got out of the inning, though, and got another run in the top of the sixth. Irvine then tagged on two more in the top of the seventh behind a pair of two-out knocks to put the Trojans in a 4-0 hole.
Unlike in previous games when the Trojans threatened often but rarely scored, they rarely threatened Tuesday.
Their best chance came in the eighth, when junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa stepped to the plate with two on and two out. But he was retired on a diving stop by Irvine first baseman Jordan Fox, and the Anteater bullpen finished off the game with four and one-thirds shutout innings of their own.
“I guess I could say I just didn’t have them prepared to play today,” Cruz said.
It marked only the second time this season USC has been shutout, the other being Saturday night on a dominant, one-hit performance by UCLA ace Trevor Bauer.
“We’re just struggling,” said senior second baseman and captain Joe De Pinto. “We gotta change things up.”
The team will report to Dedeaux Field bright and early for practice at 5 a.m. on Wednesday morning looking to do just that.
“We gotta do something,” Cruz said. “But really I’m just at a loss for words.”
The entire clubhouse echoed that statement. There were no talks of postgame plans, and many players headed right to the batting cage after the game. Assistant coach Doyle Wilson sat in his chair with his head in his hands.
It won’t get any easier for the Trojans, as they head up to Berkeley to face No. 13 California.
 
That is an understatement coming up short vs. Irvine. Getting shutout is more than short where you have no chance of winning. Cal ranked 13th who is giving up their baseball program next year while the Trojans have really not had a program for the last six years including this one. Struggling is not the word for Joe DePinto who is 2 for his last 25 at bats hitting clean up while committing a few errors in the field on top of that. The gotta do something is bring in a new head coach along with a new set of assistants to turn this sport around similar to the good days of when Gillespie was in charge..

Common basketball knowledge says having experienced players in postseason play is necessary to making a deep run in postseason tournaments.
But although no player on USC’s roster has experienced postseason play, the Women of Troy are in the Final Four of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament.
Stepping up · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos, pictured here against Arizona State, has made a smooth transition to point guard in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament, averaging 16.5 points and a team-high seven rebounds through four games. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
USC will try to continue its string of road victories against Illinois State in Normal, Ill. tonight.
The team has shown confidence and grit in its four victories in the WNIT, winning by an average of 12.75 points.
Following a first round 67-64 triumph at home over UC Santa Barbara, USC (23-12) went on the road for its past three wins.
“I’m impressed [with our run], but it doesn’t surprise me,” USC coach Michael Cooper told USCTrojans.com. “When you play good, solid defense, defense works whether you’re home or on the road. Whether it’s been a seven-minute or a 20-minute run, we’re getting good defense at certain points in the game to give ourselves a chance to win.”
USC has held its WNIT opponents to 37.2 field goal shooting percentage and allowed less than 60 points in road victories against Nevada and BYU.
But the team hasn’t been lacking on the offensive side, either.
The Women of Troy have averaged 73.5 points in the WNIT, including 87 points in their quarterfinal win over Colorado.
“Our chemistry has really seemed to click over these past couple of weeks,” said senior guard Jacki Gemelos. “If we play how we’ve been playing, we’re pretty unstoppable at this point.”
Standing in their way will be the Redbirds (24-10), who are making their third straight appearance in the WNIT semifinals, and own a perfect 17-0 home record.
It’s the first undefeated home season in school history for Illinois State, and the team has set school records for overall home wins (17) and single-season home winning streak (17).
Illinois State is 10-1 all-time in WNIT games on its home court, including 3-0 this year.
“We’ve played in some hostile environments the past couple of weeks,” Gemelos said. “It’s really shown our true character, and shown people that we can win big games on the road.”
Defense has been the key to Illinois State’s run. The Redbirds are holding their WNIT opponents to 68.2 points per game, and 33.2 percent shooting from three-point range.
Meanwhile, USC’s offense has been shooting three-pointers at a 49-percent clip in the WNIT to contribute to its 73.5 points per game.
Despite the Redbirds’ success on defense, the Women of Troy think their offense is more than capable of handling the pressure.
“With the talent that we have, it’s not just one or two players on our team putting up points,” said senior center Kari LaPlante. “So it’s going to be a lot harder [for Illinois State] to guard us.”
Forward Emily Hanley leads Illinois State in scoring with 14.3 points per game.
Last year, the Redbirds lost to USC’s Pac-10 rival, California, in the WNIT semifinals. The Redbirds boast a wealth of experience in the WNIT, having participated in the tournament four of the last five years.
But USC won’t be intimidated in its first appearance in the WNIT Final Four.
“I don’t think [postseason experience] is really going to affect the outcome of the game,” Gemelos said. “It’s just all about knocking down the open shots.”
Cooper has confidence in his team to win their game against Illinois State, and perhaps the WNIT championship.
“[The WNIT] has been a great experience for us, and now that we’re this far, we’re looking to win the whole thing,” Cooper told USCTrojans.com. “I think our shooters are a little bit better [than Illinois State’s], and that our defense is a little bit better. So, hopefully that’ll give us an opportunity to win this game.”
The winner of the game will play either Charlotte or Toledo on Saturday for the WNIT championship. Tip-off is scheduled for 5 p.m.

Internet piracy is not a new phenomenon, but steps have recently been taken to counter the problem.
Many students, however, treat Internet piracy as completely normal and excusable.
The majority of Internet piracy goes by undetected by government authority. Internet piracy is both ubiquitous and virtually unstoppable.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
But it is still is a crime. Piracy is ultimately stealing.
Nevertheless, there is something intangible about Internet piracy.
Stealing a game from a store, for instance, clearly translates into the store losing the profit it would otherwise make.
Stealing a game off the Internet, by contrast, means taking a virtual copy from an essentially unlimited supply. If it costs a company virtually nothing to produce a copy of a piece of software, why should we have to pay so much for it?
Feelings of entitlement to pirated software, music and data are the underlying causes of most Internet piracy. With increased accessibility of data, anything in the realm of ‘0s and ‘1s appears within reach.
Going further, many argue the consumer, rather than being the criminal, is the victim. The pricing of software, graphics software in particular, often creates circular arguments.
A copy of Adobe Photoshop CS5, for example, costs $299 — is this high price essentially the developer stealing from the user? Does the user deserve reasonably priced software?  Who decides what is “reasonable”?
Justifications for Internet piracy or hacking are based on arguments about who deserves what — either information is for everybody, or companies can delay technological development to increase profit.
Suppose nobody is entitled to anything. If we believe that to be true, then anything we possess is a gift. And since some of us are given more than others, we decide to share, believing we are all equally undeserving, and that we should celebrate what we have been given by not keeping it to ourselves.
A Utopian portrait?  To some degree, yes, but among the software developing community, not so far away.
The solution to Internet piracy does not lie in attacking developers or punishing pirates.
Instead, one solution is to use open- source software.  There is already a very large (and growing) community supporting open- source software.
For the non-developer, “open-source” simply means free software.
For the developer, it means computer software with available source code, which would normally be retained by developers under copyright, that is free to be analyzed and altered.
Open-source alternatives exist for most commonly pirated software. Applications like OpenOffice.org Writer, an alternative to Microsoft Word, and the GIMP, an alternative to Adobe Photoshop, permit users to export files in the formats used by their non-free  alternatives (such as .doc, .ppt, .psd, etc.).
As an open software user myself, (I’m writing this using Open Office Writer on an Ubuntu platform), I can say I have gotten by fine technologically at USC.
For some USC students, the concept of buying software might be foreign.  The most basic users likely never have to use any application not pre-installed on their computers.
If the opportunity does arise, however, consider open-source software a means to kill two birds with one stone. You can preserve both your wallet and your integrity.
Internet piracy is a product of sentiments of entitlement that reflect a dangerous pride that has plagued humans for centuries.
With a relatively low chance of legal ramifications, Internet users must decide for themselves: What is integrity in this digital age, and am I willing to pay the price of maintaining it?

Barry Bonds’ perjury trial is bringing back bad memories  for Bud Selig, Major League Baseball and, most importantly, the fans.
Selig probably thought he was out of the woods, that the whole steroid era was in the books and that MLB could move on — all that was left to worry about was how to get a good player on the Pittsburgh Pirates for once (sorry Andrew McCutcheon).
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
But it’s become clear MLB is far from closing the books on that regretful chapter. In fact, that chapter has just started, much to the detriment of fans.
The Bonds trial is going to recall the years of negligence, when league officials, owners and players alike brushed aside the rampant steroid use to “save the game.”
Because it’s opening Pandora’s box, the trial dampers what is usually an optimistic time for baseball fans. Skeptical fans once again ask themselves if the steroid problem has been eradicated and whether Selig is a competent commissioner. They’ll wonder whether league officials are still brushing aside major problems. What are they keeping from the public?
The league seems to have forgotten the fans are the biggest stakeholders.
While the prosecution is using evidence like Bonds’ growing head size and shrinking testicles, the defense continues to ride the old explanation numerous baseball players used: They didn’t know.
The fact of the matter is the public isn’t going to buy that excuse anymore. Fans deserve better than what they’re hearing right now.
During Bonds’ trial, baseball fans might finally learn about the effects of steroids on Bonds’ personality and will immediately wonder if all steroid users become this way. Or worse, are all revered athletes like this?
This is the line of questioning Selig does not want fans to follow.
He’d rather this whole trial go away, no doubt. He’d rather the fans focus on Opening Day this Thursday.
But one of baseball’s most infamous stars is on trial. The all-time leader in home runs faces jail time, and his biggest personal test. The public eye is now fixated, once again, on Barry Bonds.
Making it even worse, the Giambi brothers will also be testifying at the Bonds trial. Although Jeremy was never a supreme player, Jason’s steroid-infused success made him one of the best hitters in the MLB.
Giambi’s testimony, expected to incriminate Bonds’ personal trainer Greg Anderson, is magnified even more because he still plays for the Colorado Rockies. The questions might follow him during postgame interviews, and the likely distraction could hound him, the Rockies and the MLB until Bonds receives a verdict.
But the biggest problem is that, in the midst of court hearings and heated debate regarding MLB’s legacy, fans have been left out of the national conversation.
Ultimately, fans have a right to transparency, and the Bonds trial should only increase the clamoring among them to know even more about an era MLB is trying desperately to forget.
Eventually, the Bonds trial will end and MLB can go back to pretending  the steroid era is over. But while it drags on, Selig must do damage control. He has to come out and proclaim the culture of baseball has changed — that the post-Mitchell report MLB is clean.
Bonds will go away soon enough, but while he’s in the spotlight, those dark days of baseball are, too. And it hurts nobody more than those who fill the seats.

The bubblegum “…Baby One More Time” Britney Spears is long gone, but the fierce Femme Fatale Britney Spears has no reason to miss her, and neither do we.
Spears’ reputation precedes her. Luckily, her seventh studio album manages to keep up with the tumultuous pop music scene and gives her a product with nearly as much impact as her name for the first time in a while.
Femme Fatale combines the mystique of 2003’s In The Zone, the strange aggressiveness of 2007’s Blackout and the cheeky fun of 2008’s Circus. The result might just be her most comprehensive and consistent release to date.
A group of super-producers including Dr. Luke and Max Martin, two guys responsible for a good chunk of songs the radio won’t stop playing, was behind the making of Femme Fatale.
As expected, autotune is abundant from start to finish, but it isn’t nearly as distracting as expected.
“Hold It Against Me,” Femme Fatale’s first single, is a fairly accurate gauge of the overall sound of the album: a heavy-hitting club banger all about having a good time. Its brazen double entendre more than makes up for Circus’ weak attempt at cleverness with the controversial “If U Seek Amy.”
Unlike in Spears’ previous efforts, the lead single is not the obvious high point of the album. Save for one dud, the irritating “Big Fat Bass” featuring Will.i.Am, there is no filler begging to be skipped on Femme Fatale.
Each song is equally infectious, yet has its own character distinguishing it from the others.
Several songs take big risks. The bumping “(Drop Dead) Beautiful” is almost vicious in its confidence and features a cameo from up-and-coming female rapper Sabi in the bridge.
Spears’ second single, “Til The World Ends,” is pure rambunctious dance music, like every Blackout track on ecstasy. The trance hit sounds undeniably different from most of its current top-40 counterparts.
As a whole, the album is more understated and slightly sharper than the material Spears’ contemporaries, like Christina Aguilera, have released in recent years.
What makes Femme Fatale all the more interesting is although every track is made for the dance floor, a hint of darkness lingers behind these songs full of sex and synth.
The semi-ballad “Inside Out” is surprisingly raw. Obsessive and emotional, the song describes a destructive relationship with lyrics that nod to Spears’ complicated past.
Another tenacious track, “Seal It With A Kiss,” sounds peppy but is laced with undertones more sinister than what is usually found in a standard Spears tune.
Momentum doesn’t let up even toward the end of the album. The wispy, cosmic “Trip To Your Heart” is sandwiched between the rough-around-the-edges “Trouble For Me” and the silky “Gasoline,” akin to a less frantic “Toxic.” The flow shouldn’t work, but it does.
The album offers a strong finish in the form of the quirky “Criminal,” which has unexpected melodies reminiscent of flutes and acoustic guitars.
The deluxe edition of Femme Fatale comes with four bonus songs.
The ridiculously catchy “Up N Down” is especially fun, but the clear standout is “He About To Lose Me.”
Grammatical errors aside, the track is equal parts haunting, alluring and sad. Spears does some solid vocal work here, her smokey singing seamlessly drifting over captivating beats.
It might not quite be radio- friendly, but it deserves to stand alongside the best in Spears’ musical catalogue.
Spears has no writing credit on Femme Fatale, though her persona does subtly peek through the cracks. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, she made it very clear she is “heavily involved in every album” and “will only record songs [she] love[s].”
Taking the creative helm and coming out with something as fresh as Femme Fatale proves Spears might be smarter than people think, at least when it comes to her music.
Naysayers can naysay all they want, but it doesn’t change the fact that Spears has managed to remain relevant nearly 13 years into her career.
Is Femme Fatale a musical masterpiece?
Of course not. And no one is pretending that it is, especially not Spears herself.
It is a solid and effective record worthy of repeat listens that greatly succeeds in the context for which it was made — reaffirming Spears’ spot at the top of the pop pyramid.

We all crave the unspoken enormities in life. As students, surrounded by the tasteless swill of Coors and Miller, some of us long for the higher rafters of brewed brilliance. The traumatic zing of fresh hops, the earthy wave of toasted malts, the realization that after one beer, your night is over.
For those screaming, “Yes, that’s me! What must I do?” consider these four unique beers. Like Apocalypse Now, each dances upon the razor blade of madness, heaping on the flavor and ferocity with nothing but contempt for humanity.
 
 
Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale — Escondido, California.
 
A beer so ambitiously named seems destined to disappoint, but Escondido’s Stone Brewery has crafted a malevolent monster of an ale with its Arrogant Bastard.
Like Medusa, the Bastard boasts a diverse array of heads, borrowing influences from many brews. Though billed as an ale, the Bastard pours like wild honey, boasts seductive shades of walnuts, barley and toffee, and burns like the fiercest of India Pale Ales, thanks to a hidden layer of dry citrus hops. Every bottle yields a different experience, enough to warrant the brew’s intimidating title as well as a heavy-duty trip to the nearest liquor outlet.
Thankfully, the Arrogant Bastard is widely available at beer stores in and outside of California. BevMo carries it regularly, and it is also served on tap at The Lab Gastropub.
Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter — Frederick, Maryland
 
Dedicated to the memory and spirit of the late gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, this rich porter is an acid-washed trip to Vegas and then some.
Weighing in at 7.8 percent alcohol and brewed by the fun folks at Maryland’s Flying Dog Brewery, the Gonzo pours dark as an oak tree, but comes laced with sweet accents of coffee, dark chocolate and even a twist of licorice. It is loaded with enough malt extract to add a welcome air of pretension to what is otherwise a gregarious, balls-to-the-wall brew.
Still, watch out for the hidden sting of the alcohol. Like Thompson himself, the Gonzo might seem sweet as a caramel at a first sip, but there are lurking demons in each bottle. Those brave enough to take the plunge can pick up a case of Gonzo at BevMo, or, pending availability, Trojan Liquor, where other Flying Dog brews like the Raging Bitch have been found.
 
Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye — Healdsburg, California
 
Bear Republic’s rather bland Racer 5 IPA has been the subject of unwarranted praise, but its less-publicized  Hop Rod Rye India Pale Ale is an engine of flavored fury.
The secret here is the inclusion of rye with the traditional medley of malt extract and hops. Its presence renders this amber-orange colored brew one of the fattest IPAs on the market, with an inherent spiciness to compliment the more traditional hints of grapefruit, grass and flowers. This makes the Hop Rod Rye ideal for both hot and cold climates, crisp and bitter enough for a night on the beach, but also capable of warming up a night in Idyllwild, when there are no logs to be burned.
The Hop Rod Rye can be tougher to find than other Bear Republic beers. BevMo is a fine place to start, but be prepared to try another location if your search comes up empty at first.
 
 
Stone Ruination IPA —Escondido, California.
 
This is it. The Big One, Shiva, the Godzilla of American IPAs. If you value your taste buds, stop reading now.
Stone’s Ruination IPA might not be the strongest IPA on the planet, that honor goes to Scotland’s Sink the Bismarck. But for American beers, it’s a borderline liability issue.
Bearing the thoughtful insignia of a winged beast, the aptly named Ruination is a hop-lover’s fantasy and a Blue Moon fan’s worst nightmare, with blasts of pine, bitter citrus, alpine flowers and cereal grains. Were the brew’s alcohol content any higher than its 7.2 percent, it would be undrinkable. Thankfully, the Stone scientists have added a welcome curtain of raisin to soften the burn left by the beer’s rating of 100-plus International Bitterness Units.
Don’t even think of enjoying a nice steak or salad with this beer — you won’t taste a morsel. The Ruination is not a beverage to be taken lightly, but for those mature and masochistic enough, it’s a transcendent experience. BevMo can help you in your search for this bottled enlightenment.
 
 
I want to try the Stone Ruination so bad…and then pass out after.

I first heard “Hey Baby Baby” with T-Pain on the chorus at a party near campus last semester. If you’re between the ages of 14 and 30 or enjoy pop music, you’ve probably heard the song, too.
It might be “old” in most pop listeners’ ears, but it’s still catchy. It’s a senseless yet danceable electronic pop song to which T-Pain adds pretty much what you’d expect from the autotune hook master.
It wasn’t until recently, however, that I found out the song is by Miami-based rapper Pitbull.
Call me old, late, out of touch or dumb for not knowing that already, but I couldn’t believe it.
The same guy who mixed reggaeton and rap on Latino-influenced songs such as “Culo” and “I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)” is now doing electronic songs?
The rapper who once boldly blended Latin rhythms and Spanish lyrics with hip-hop/pop tracks is now the cheap ripoff of David Guetta, who I’ve been relentlessly hearing for the last few months? Disappointing.
Pitbull is yet another example of the relatively recent trend of otherwise fading pop stars jumping on the electronic and house music bandwagon.
Hip-hop leaning beats and rhymes are being traded in for gleamy synths and persistent, pounding techno drum kits.
The most successful instance of this phenomenon has undoubtedly been Britney Spears’ triumphant return to popularity.
A few years ago, playing a Britney Spears song like “…Baby One More Time” would have been done only as a joke or for the sake of ’90s nostalgia.
Now, it’s common to hear the singer’s new songs blaring out of houses and apartments on weekend nights around here, but in complete seriousness.
Spears’ new album Femme Fatale came out this week. I didn’t listen to it, but I already know what’s on it: electronic pop. The formula is simple, since it only requires four-on-the-floor house drum beats that make people want to dance.
The lyrics and singing don’t really matter, just the pounding, effected kick drum and layers upon layers of synthesizers.
Other pop sensations, such as Lady Gaga and the Black Eyed Peas, started out by experimenting with electro, but these other artists seem to just be cashing in on the current trend.
Because I live in Southern California and am surrounded by techno purists who can’t stop talking about Hard, EDC, Danceism or any other rave, I am constantly bombarded with complaints about how pop stars are ruining the genre.
I can’t help but agree, as bandwagon-jumping pop stars sound like lackluster imitations of songs from genuine house or techno artists.
The dubstep breakdown on Spears’ “Hold It Against Me” is laughable compared to older, more original and authentic dubstep tracks, but it demonstrates just how big a role electronic music plays in pop these days.
Even Usher seems to have reinvented himself as an electro-pop star. He went from singing straightforward R&B songs, such as the Jermaine Dupri-assisted “Burn,” to electro-club songs such as the autotune-assisted “OMG.”
I remember when the singer was dubbed “The King of R&B.” Now he sounds more like the Jester of Techno.
Eminem once infamously insulted Moby by saying It’s over / Nobody listens to techno on his song “Without Me.”
Ten years later, techno seems to be the only thing you can catch anyone listening to.
Now even pop stars like Britney Spears, who were attacked in Eminem songs years ago, are making electronic and house songs.
Sounds like Em’s worst nightmare. Mine too.

Electro is in. It’s a rehash of the 80s; everything is recycled, reincarnated, etc. The synthesizer sounds and the talk box a la T-pain, Roger Troutman/Zapp are back. I love it.

To dissect Duncan Jones’ debut film Moon is to discover the re-engineering of a tired sub-genre of science fiction. The mythology of Moon, although somewhat trite, is laced with visionary elements that elevate what could have easily become another derivative entry into sci-fi lore.
In Source Code, conversely, Jones’ choices seemed forced and studio-mandated.
Train wreck · Compared to director Duncan Jones’ previous films, Source Code feels less genuine and more focused on commercialism. The characters lack believability and complexity, despite the unique story. - Photos courtesy of Summit Entertainment 
The weathered texture of his previous effort is supplanted by a varnished music-video look, and what could have been a complex indie head-trip becomes a mainstream potboiler, with a veneer of art.
The overt product placement and unfortunate reliance on unconvincing visual effects dilute Jones’ vision. In effect, Source Code is the film Moon would have been if the thrust of its creation was financial gain.
Written by sci-fi scribe Ben Ripley, Source Code presents an intriguing minimalist yarn about a soldier named Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up aboard a commuter train in the body of another man and becomes entangled in an experimental type of crime solving. His mission, as explained by his superiors Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), is to find a bomber aboard the train in eight minutes flat.
Altogether, the rollicking 94 minutes we’re given with these characters is not enough to involve us on more than a superficial level. Both Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan, who plays the bewitching Christina Warren, are believably tragic paramours, but their rushed romance never feels earned.
Each character is an object, not a person, so even in the moments when Gyllenhaal experiences agony, a distracting insincerity looms.
Farmiga, who traditionally disappears into this sort of Wonder Woman role, is simply there to facilitate the film’s happy ending and is altogether insubstantial. The laughable Jeffrey Wright isn’t afforded the proper dimensions necessary to make him human to the audience, and Michael Arden, known in the film as Derek Frost, exudes only a fraction of the necessary subdued madness that would make his everyman villain work.
The script, independent of the execution, is a seminal mainstream work. The plotting is ingenious, and the inherent repetition required by the story’s curious conceit never allows for dull moments: The dynamism of the film is bolstered by a pulse-pounding score.
That said, the majority of the movie takes place in claustrophobic interior locations (a train) and the sweeping underscore seems to overcompensate for what the composer saw as inherent narrative restrictions.
Many of the crescendos seem to plead for car chases and gunfire, but Ripley’s script was never about action thrills. He could have tethered us along a bit better by dropping subtle and organic hints about the meaning of the source code, the set of instructions which Colter must decode to catch a bomber, but this film is fundamentally about love, and, in a more sci-fi sense, falling in love with someone who is already dead.
We know the film is about love because Ripley breezes through all of the explanations of “source code,” giving more importance to the romantic arc.
But when you hurl a furiously dramatic character into an ordinary world, there is an automatic tendency toward comedy.
With such a stark contrast between emotional extremes, the tonal shifts are jarring and laugh-inducing. Despite his motivations as a soldier on a mission, none of Gyllenhaals’s outbursts feel justified, especially as he targets innocent bystanders, mistaking them for nefarious bombers.
Obviously, he needs to make mistakes before capturing the real culprit, but the way he brashly attacks other passengers is overwrought and ultimately silly.
The main issue with the suspense in this film is what could be referred to as the “Allsburg-syndrome,” named after the author of children’s books Jumanji and Zathura.
Although the train could blow at any moment, we never feel unsafe and we experience a videogame-like security. No matter what, the character has multiple opportunities to “beat the game,” which diffuses all tension.
Source Code is not an abomination by any means, but it is a missed opportunity. There are dozens of commendable moments, but the film lacks a mesmerizing quality that would have placed it near the top of the list of successful recent sci-fi films.
Source Code, however, as both a thriller and a romance, feels terribly manufactured.
