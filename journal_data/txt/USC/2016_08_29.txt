The Black Student Assembly introduced the core concepts it will use in this year’s programming, including intersectionality and empowering black excellence, at its first meeting Monday night.
The Assistant Director of the BSA, Brianna Thorpe, spoke of intersectionality as the acknowledgement of different identities that contribute to the black experience.
“It’s really important that we — the BSA —are accommodating all of the different communities on campus,” Thorpe said.
Thorpe is planning an event in October to celebrate the life of Celia Cruz, a Cuban singer and Afro-Latina icon. She hopes this event will bring together black individuals of different backgrounds.
“We have many different cultures that make up ‘black.’ ‘Black’ is the classification, but there are people who are Nigerian, people who are Caribbean, people who are Afro-Latino. We don’t discriminate,” Thorpe said.
According to Thorpe, the BSA aims to increase its involvement with under-represented groups.
“One of the things we’re also trying to do is making sure we’re including the LGBT community, because queer people of color are often ostracized,” Thorpe said.
Some students who attended the meeting were interested in learning about different groups. Silvia Morales, a junior studying psychology and a member of a Sigma Lambda Gamma sorority, is one such student.
“My sorority is based upon diversity. We take pride in having cultural awareness so we strive to learn about other communities, like the black community,” Morales said.
Aside from being inclusive, the BSA also aims to empower. The Executive Director of the BSA, Ahlia Bethea, spoke about how the organization should support black individuals by celebrating not only scholastic achievements, but achievements in all fields. To do this, the BSA recently established a new position on its executive board, the “Creative Experience” position, to recognize black artists within the USC and Los Angeles community.
“We want different talented individuals to know that they are being supported. Whether it’s going out to people’s plays or going to sports games and supporting the athletes, we want to make sure we’re highlighting the ways we’re thriving,” Bethea said.
In response to the incidents of violence against black individuals that occurred over the summer — including the fatal shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile — the BSA’s co-unity chairs, M.C. Omete Anassi and Preston Fregia showed a clip from Kendrick Lamar’s music video for the song “Alright.”
“When we were thinking of how to set the tone [for the meeting] and how we’re going to reach everyone in this room. We decided to use this song ‘we gon’ be alright’ because we are going to be alright,” Fregia said. “It doesn’t matter who you are, no matter what your background is. We’re going to love you, and BSA is going to be a home for you.”
For Bethea, making the BSA a “safe” and “restorative” space is her biggest priority.
“A lot of the things that happened over the summer were extremely traumatic and targeting and triggering to our community,” Bethea said. “We want to make sure that we’re providing a space for people to heal. We really want the Black Student Assembly to be a restorative space for people to come and know that there are other individuals that look like them and feel the same things. We want people to know they have a support system in us.”

Graduate students enrolled in private universities won the right to be recognized as employees under the National Labor Relations Board last week. Graduate students will now be able to unionize according to the court ruling.
The sheer size of USC’s graduate student population may mean that this ruling could have a significant impact on the University’s dynamic.
The ruling comes as a reversal of a previous case involving graduate students at Brown University in 2004. The petitioning students were deemed not to be employees since they “are primarily students and have a primarily educational, not economic, relationship with their university,” the ruling stated. Conversely, public universities in certain states allow their student employees to make use of collective bargaining laws, which makes unionization feasible. The Columbia University students who began the petition will be joining the United Automobile Workers union, according to The New York Times.
USC was home to more than 24,591 graduate and professional students during the 2015-2016 year, almost 6,000 more students than were enrolled in the undergraduate program. In 2015, USC awarded more Master’s degrees than any other type of degree.
Yet, in a faculty report from USC’s Office of Budget and Planning, teaching assistants and research assistants are not accounted for in the faculty count nor the student worker count. On a national level, these educational assistants are not considered full-time instructional faculty by American Association of University Professors in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey.
Full-time faculty status excludes “undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like,” the statement reads.
Graduate Student Government is planning to discuss their stance on the matter during their first Senate meeting on Sept. 12. Vice Provost for Graduate Programs Sarah Pratt was optimistic about a forthcoming discussion with graduate student groups, such as GSG and the Graduate School Advisory Council. Pratt is responsible for all of the University’s Ph.D. programs, and she oversees specific master’s programs, according to the USC website.
“Our graduate students have shown that they are smart and take active and constructive approaches to problems,” Pratt said. “I really treasure the working relationship we have established … We get a lot done because we sort things out together.”
A graduate student and teaching assistant at one of USC’s schools, who asked that their identity remain confidential, feels strongly about the need for a unionization effort. They believe that the school administration has taken advantage of the formerly-ambiguous employee status of graduate students.
“My problem has been [that] I’m treated as an employee when it’s convenient and a student when that’s convenient. I’m an employee for tax reasons and a student when it comes to working these hours without a retirement plan,” the graduate student said.
One of the more dire issues that graduate students face is the lack of benefits and retirement plans that full-time faculty have a right to. Also, the graduate students no longer have access to benefits for dependents, which were available several years ago, according to the graduate student.
“On paper, I looked so much like an employee that I got an email from USC benefits services asking if I wanted to apply for 401(k) plan,” the graduate student said. “I said ‘sign me up!’ I got all the way to the appointment, at which point it was understood that I was a graduate student. Then they said that I wasn’t eligible.”
Ruth Kelly, a second-year graduate student in Annenberg, spoke about the allegedly stagnant stipend rates for graduate students, which have not taken inflation rates or the increased minimum wage into account.
“We are getting a stipend that has not been adjusted for inflation or cost [of] living for the past 10 years, from what I can tell,” Kelly said. “When I came in two years ago, I asked a fifth-year student if  [the salary] had been $30,000 a year as long as he was there, [and] it had. The purchasing power of our stipend is decreasing each year.”
For Kelly, this means struggling to find a way to pay the rent while working as a teaching assistant.
“I ended up moving up in with friends who had been living in one area for 10 years — it’s a rent-controlled area,” Kelly said. “I live in Brea. The first semester I commuted from San Diego, [but] I can’t do that now because I’m a TA.”
The standard teaching assistant stipend is actually a meager $22,000 per year; $30,000 is the increased fellowship rate.

If defense wins championships, then No. 20 USC will need to have a standout defensive performance in what will be a championship-like atmosphere for their season-opening matchup against the No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide this Saturday.
John McGillen | Daily TrojanSophomore sensation · Linebacker Cameron Smith burst onto the scene as a freshman and will carry big responsbilities in his second year.
Entering the offseason, the state of the USC defensive line was the most evident issue the team faced in preparing for the upcoming season. The Trojans lost five active members of their defensive line rotation from 2015 over the summer. Additionally, junior defensive lineman Kenny Bigelow — who was set to be USC’s lone upperclassmen up front this season — tore his ACL during spring workouts.
To alleviate the losses on the defensive front, USC acquired former Utah defensive lineman Stevie Tu’ikolovatu via transfer. At 6-foot-1, 320-pounds, Tu’ikolovatu is a stout nose tackle who can occupy blockers and shut running lanes for the opposing offensive backs. USC defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s aggressive 5-2 scheme directly asks for this type of personnel at nose tackle; Tu’ikolovatu is a perfect addition in the trenches for the Trojans. The team also added Juco transfer Josh Fatu from Long Beach Community College and retains players such as sophomores Rasheem Green and Noah Jefferson, who both had rotational roles as true freshmen last season. Redshirt junior Kahliel Rodgers has also made a transition from the offensive to the defensive line in 2016, further bolstering the depth of the USC front.
Despite the additions, this will still be a relatively brand-new unit personnel-wise. The Trojans won’t have much time to shuffle out growing pains as a defensive line, either, as they are being pitted against an Alabama offensive line that has built a reputation for pushing its running backs to Heisman podiums: Just last year, Alabama’s Derrick Henry — who won the Heisman Trophy — rushed for 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns behind the Crimson Tide offensive line.
While Alabama did lose three players from its offensive front over the offseason, including Rimington Award-winner Ryan Kelly, USC’s newly formed defensive front still has an almost-immediate reality check awaiting them this Saturday.
The Trojan linebacking corps’ ability to play off of whatever penetration the defensive line can provide will be pivotal against the Tide. The linebackers will be responsible for diagnosing a new-look Alabama offense, which will be spearheaded in the backfield by sophomore running back Bo Scarbrough and a new quarterback — yet to be named by Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban.
In Pendergast’s 5-2 scheme, it is primarily up to linebackers to establish the aggressive and anticipative tempo of play defensively. Similar to the 3-4 defense, Pendergast’s defense utilizes a pair of both inside and outside linebackers. In the middle, sophomore Cameron Smith assumes the main leadership role of this Trojan defense as an inside linebacker. A true freshman in 2015, Smith was a Freshman All-American and was named the Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year.
On the outside, many expect sophomore Porter Gustin to have a breakout 2016 campaign. A hybrid defensive end and outside linebacker, Gustin has the ability and size (6-foot-5, 260 pounds) to impact games as an edge-rusher. Joining Smith and Gustin as starters for the linebacking corps will be senior Michael Hutchings and junior Uchenna Nwosu.
These linebackers have the opportunity to wreak havoc defensively and disrupt whomever it may be that will line up under center for the Tide Saturday.
Alabama brings a talented wide receiver group to AT&T Stadium, primarily led by sophomore wideout Calvin Ridley. Ridley caught 89 passes for a total of 1045 yards and seven touchdowns as a true freshman in 2015.
Fortunately for the Trojans, they may bear their most talent on the defensive side on the edges at the starting cornerback slots. On one side of the field, sophomore cornerback Iman Marshall is coming off of a 2015 season in which he garnered freshman All-American honors. Directly across the field from Marshall is junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. Jackson — who has been a Swiss army knife offensively, defensively and on special teams for the Trojans since arriving in 2014 — has made it known that his priorities will be set on performing as a defensive back this season. Entering this season, Jackson was selected to the preseason watch list for the Jim Thorpe award, which is awarded annually to the nation’s top cornerback.
In the secondary for the Trojans, redshirt junior Chris Hawkins and sophomore Marvell Tell will be starting at safety and free safety, respectively. Both Hawkins and Tell have dealt with hamstring issues this fall camp, but look to be 100 percent entering the regular season.
USC and Alabama are similar in that both programs are entering transitional years at the quarterback position. Whichever defense proves able to disrupt the others’ opening day, first-time starter very well may come away with the season-opening victory.

Trojan Nation may not want to hear it, but the Crimson Tide are favored by 10.5 points. In all aspects, No. 20 USC enters Saturday’s game as the underdog. The Trojans may not look at it in such a light, but they’re facing the No. 1 defending national champions in Alabama.
The Trojans aren’t used to being the underdog; they’re expected to win most games when they take the field, but maybe being the underdog against the Tide isn’t such a bad thing to be.
USC takes the field Saturday night with few expectations — which, if last season is taken into account, having a lot of expectations beforehand can be hard to match, especially when they aren’t met. The Thursday night 17-12 loss to Washington last year is just one example.
This game can go one of three ways for the Trojans: They lose handily as predicted, hang in and keep it close, or upset Alabama. Two of those options will bode well for USC. Obviously, getting blown out would be the worst case scenario. While a blow-out loss would be a demoralizing way to start the season, it would only damage the rest of the season if the team dwells on the loss. If it creates a domino effect on the rest of the season, head coach Clay Helton and his coaching staff’s legitimacy and legacy would be in jeopardy. It could also sway potential recruits, impacting the program for years to come. However, if they were to get blown out, the Trojans still have 11 more regular season games to make up for such a loss.
If the Trojans hang with the Tide — maybe even trading the lead back-and-forth — but still lose, they can focus on the positives aspects of the game and build on those moving forward. Even a close loss would exceed many people’s’ expectations — as Alabama is favored by more than 10 points.
Now, if USC manages to pull off the upset, that would shock the college football world. While the immediate shock would come from USC winning as the double-digit underdog, its foundation stems from polar opposite recent seasons for these two teams. The programs could not have a more opposite track record the last seven years.
Since 2009, Alabama has a record of 86-10 (with one 14-0 season), USC has a record of 61-31 (with only two 10-win seasons). The Crimson Tide have won three National Championships (two BCS, one CFB) and won two — the Capital One Bowl and Cotton Bowl — of four bowl games. The Trojans haven’t even won their conference yet alone a National Championship in that timespan, although they do have a 3-2 record in bowl games with wins in the Emerald Bowl, Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl and Holiday Bowl.
There’s one more stat of notable importance. For Alabama, it’s an indicator of its consistency. For USC, it’s an indicator of its troubles. Nick Saban has been steadfast for Alabama, while Pete Carroll, Lane Kiffin, Ed Orgeron, Steve Sarkisian and Clay Helton have all coached the Trojans in the last six years.
The Trojans have the power to turn the tide if they leave the past behind them. A defining win against the top team in college football could set the Trojans on the course to reclaim their spot as one of the top programs in college football. It will take standout performances from returners like junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith along with some breakout performances from newcomers such as redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne, sophomore defensive tackle Noah Jefferson and freshman defensive end Oluwole Betiku.
Even though Alabama is favored by double digits, the game will probably be close — no more than a touchdown differential. Regardless, the outcome of the Cowboy Classic will shape the rest of the season for the Trojans, especially Helton’s legacy as head coach and USC as a program in the long run.

Uhh, who said we didn’t? It’s foolish to think you’re always on top. Tables turn, times change….life is about adjusting constantly.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanImmediate spotlight · Rather than facing an easier opponent in week one, Clay Helton and the Trojans will open against the No. 1-ranked team.
He first joined the USC Trojan football staff in 2010, serving as the quarterbacks coach for the Matt Barkley-led offense. In 2013, he was named offensive coordinator for the team and nine months ago, he took over as the team’s head coach in the middle of the 2015 season.
Now, it’s time to rumble for USC head football coach Clay Helton, as he opens his first full season at the helm against defending national champions No. 1 Alabama and five-time national champion head coach Nick Saban on Saturday.
Helton looks to lead the No. 20 Trojans to an upset that would rock the college football world when they face the Crimson Tide in Arlington, Texas. Helton aims for a strong start following USC’s turbulent season last year; he took the reins as head coach Oct. 12 following the departure of Steve Sarkisian.
The Trojans went 5-4 under Helton (5-2 in the regular season) to finish the year 8-6 overall. With Helton at the lead, USC earned notable victories over No. 3 Utah and No. 22 UCLA, but fell to No. 7 Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship Game and No. 23 Wisconsin in the Holiday Bowl. Helton was named the permanent head coach of the team on Nov. 30.
Standing opposite Helton at “Jerryworld” will be one of college football’s most decorated coaches of all-time in Nick Saban. The first head coach to win a national championship with two different schools, Saban has won four national titles with Alabama (the other coming with Louisiana State). In Saban’s 10 seasons at Alabama, the Tide have an overall record of 100-18. Last season, the Tide went 14-1 and defeated Clemson in the national championship game. Now, the Tide sit atop the AP Poll once more as they prepare to face the Trojans for the first time in more than 30 years.
Though in his first head coaching job, the 44-year-old Helton has guided Division I football players from the sideline for 20 years. Since 1995, Helton has served at Duke, Houston and Memphis as well as USC, in positions such as running backs coach, receivers coach, quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator.
Supporting the first-time head coach, Helton’s platoon of coaching personnel will feature a mix of faces both new and old to the cardinal and gold.
In his fifth year on the USC coaching staff, Tee Martin will serve as the Trojans’ offensive coordinator, moving into the position from his previous post as wide receivers coach. Mentoring newly-minted redshirt junior starting quarterback Max Browne will be Clay’s younger brother Tyson Helton, who became the Trojans’ quarterback coach after serving the same position as well as offensive coordinator for Western Kentucky last season.
USC’s running back coach in 2013 and a former coach for the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals, Tommie Robinson returns to the position after two years with the University of Texas. Having overseen the offensive line for Alabama-Birmingham, Georgia and Auburn over his 37 years of coaching, Neil Callaway enters his first year as offensive line coach for the Trojans. John Baxter, USC’s special teams coordinator from 2010 to 2013, returns to USC to coach special teams and tight ends after a year at the University of Michigan.
On the defensive end, ball-stopping guru Clancy Pendergast also rejoins the Trojan staff as defensive coordinator, the post he held in 2013 before joining the San Francisco 49ers. Johnny Hansen returns for his third season as the team’s linebackers coach and assistant head coach. Kenechi Udeze, a former USC All-American and NFL defensive lineman, enters his first full season coaching the Trojan defensive line. Ronnie Bradford, another former NFL player and coach, joins the USC coaching staff as secondary coach from Louisiana Tech.
Trojan faithful will also spot a familiar face on the Alabama sideline, as former USC head coach Lane Kiffin enters his second season as offensive coordinator for the Crimson Tide. Before joining Alabama last season, Kiffin led the Trojans to a total record of 28-15 over four years. Saturday marks the first time Kiffin will face the Trojans since he was let go as head coach in 2013, and the first time Kiffin goes against the former quarterbacks coach from his USC coaching staff, Clay Helton.

Shortly before 2 p.m. on Monday, a student heading south on Catalina Street was robbed by a male suspect in his late twenties, according to the Department of Public Safety.
The suspect jumped out of a nearby car, tore her phone from her hands, jumped back in and sped away. The student remained unharmed.
Police officers responded to the incident and are continuing to conduct an investigation to see if the suspect is still in the area. The suspect vehicle is a black four-door sedan with a possible license plate of 7MIF822.
DPS sent an email to students at approximately 5:45 p.m. to alert them of the crime.
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle warned students not to walk off campus after dark, and instead to go with friends or take advantage of campus transportation services such as the Campus Cruiser or an Uber. Carlisle also advised students to make safe choices.
“It would be helpful if students, particularly if they’re out alone, not to show off their valuables, to pay attention to their surroundings, [and] maybe wait to make that phone call so that someone wouldn’t see their phone in their hand,” Carlisle said.
Though these instances are rare, Carlisle said that DPS prefers that they not happen at all.
“Safety at USC is a partnership between DPS and the students,” Carlisle said. “Listen to those safety tips I provided and most people will never have an issue.”

The University of Chicago recently released a statement condemning “trigger warnings” and safe spaces. The university claimed that such procedures inhibit free speech and the “freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas.” It also claimed that they do not approve of intellectual safe spaces where students could “retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.” The letter has warranted a wide variety of responses — fervent support from many who claim that college campuses are overrun with political correctness and coddling, as well as opposition from many who claim that it interferes with diversity and inclusion initiatives.
Trigger warnings have been misconstrued for several years now. The words “coddling,” “privileged” and “real–world” are now negatively associated with the term. Most people seem to think that trigger warnings are a get-out-of-jail-free card for any student who feels that discussing difficult topics makes them uncomfortable. This is simply not the case. Trigger warnings have always been and remain a gentle warning to the material coming ahead. Students who may have personal experiences related to the graphic content are able to properly prepare themselves for reading, discussions and other educational interactions.
College years are a time when students are supposed to be pushed intellectually.  College courses are meant to deal with topics that students may never have discussed before, analyzing and digging deeper into the complexities that affect our society today. They are inevitably going to be uncomfortable — and are meant to grow from that feeling. Trigger warnings in no way interfere with this intellectual learning curve.
Trigger warnings can be compared to warning signs near construction zones, a list of health risks read before riding on a roller coaster and signs that certain dishes “may contain nuts.” Mental health can and should be treated as equal to physical health, and treating trigger warnings as anything but equivalent to these signs diminishes the struggle of those who suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. Opponents to trigger warnings often ask, “Where does it stop?” Just as with the examples listed before, society has norms outlining what is obvious and what is not. Peanut butter jars do not have disclaimers about containing nuts, but chocolate chip cookies in a restaurant often do. It is up to professors to decide when, how and where to issue trigger warnings. Professors are better able to fully understand the implications of their material, and can therefore decide what may or may not affect students negatively.
The notion that students are routinely opting out of classes because the material that is covered makes them uncomfortable has been proven to be untrue. According to New York Magazine, only 15 percent of professors have ever been asked for trigger warnings, and 13.3 percent of those professors have been asked “once or twice.” Trigger warnings are saved for instances in which students feel that the material can truly affect them, or a fellow classmate. They are not being used to avoid others’ opinions and get out of difficult conversations.
These conversations about coddling and entitled millennials infantilize college students. The reality is that students enjoy to be pushed and challenged. According to The New York Times, 78 percent of students “preferred  a campus ‘where students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints,’ including offensive and biased speech, over a campus where such speech is prohibited.” The first amendment is well and alive on college campuses, as is students’ desire to engage in difficult conversations.
Trigger warnings and safe spaces do not stop students from having difficult conversations. They enable them to have them in more productive ways. In the very rare occasions in which they are used, students are able to engage in such discussions calmly and by listening to all sides and opinions on the matter. Restructuring and redefining the term not as an escape but rather as a means to productive communication will prove to be valuable as colleges continue to develop their diversity initiatives and protect their intellectual ethos.
When I went to USC I took an elective class; it was an ethnic studies one. There were a few times I thought the professor said some “insensitive” things. I just laugh at him because I know in the REAL world i.e. private sector, shit degrees like the one he holds….couldn’t get him a J, O, B. 
…Had I known what this professor was like, I’d avoid him like a disease.
This is the direction our country is headed….scary!
Oh, to be protected all through life from pending unpleasant events or knowledge. And never to suffer a slight or even a downright insult. Nice if you can afford to be such a tender, delicate, fragile little flower. But if you are going to work for a living, or deal with difficult people, a college is doing you no favors by insulating you with “trigger warnings,” “safe spaces” or similar protective coddling. No, such a college would be helping you to fail in a tough outside world where you will find no such protection for your delicate sensibilities.
No, that is NOT to say that college should be a place to promote suffering vicious insults, personal attacks or repulsive experiences. But neither should it shield you, any more than outside life will. Better you be prepared through all your school years – college included – than devastated when you hit that cold, cruel world.
They may help people have nice, friendly and civil conversation, but they do not push boundaries and they do not make people confront their own prejudices. 
After 25 you have to work with people you don’t agree with, but you must learn to communicate effectively with respect for all. And there are no trigger warnings, that is a learned skill, that will be lost without an open environment to learn it in. If a person can’t do that at university then I really don’t know where s/he will.

Saying “Free tuition!” to a USC student has the same effect as “Build a wall!” has on my older friends in Oklahoma — both audiences are euphorically stimulated by such an immediate and drastic solution to their problems. Real change seems to never be made by the bureaucratic hellhole that is the government, this being a criticism that keeps the media in business. However, most major problems in our country cannot be remedied with a quick fix, even if the solution is coming from radical third-party candidates like Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, who both offer either a non-solution or an unrealistic solution to the student debt problem.
Johnson has repeatedly stated that college tuition is high because of guaranteed college loans. In other words, because every student knows he or she is guaranteed a loan for college, college administrations have no reason to keep tuition low. To illustrate, Johnson states “If every college student tomorrow says, ‘I’m not going to go to college until the price of college, university education drops,’ guess what? It would. It would happen. It would happen dramatically.” Unfortunately, all Johnson has done is demonstrate that he understands the most basic principle of capitalism, not come up with an inventive angle on the problem. Johnson concludes with, “And I am sorry that college graduates today have been sold a bill of goods. Graduating college with a home mortgage without the home. I think college students have been sold a bill of goods.” As seen on his website, Johnson seems far more concerned with the problems of secondary education (and eliminating the Department of Education itself) than the cost of public universities.
Jill Stein, on the other hand, actually offers a solution for those struggling with student debt. Unfortunately, her plan is as unrealistic as Trump’s wall. According to her website, Stein plans to “abolish student debt to free a generation of Americans from debt servitude” and “guarantee tuition-free, world-class public education from preschool through university.” Her plan is to bail out students with debt “through quantitative easing, the finance tool used to bail out the banks. This would be a huge stimulus for the economy, as young people are enabled to follow their dreams & re-imagine our future — as every new generation must.”
A question you might be asking is “What is quantitative easing?” Essentially, quantitative easing is the government creating more money in the hopes that it boosts the economy. The Economist published a thorough analysis of the effects of quantitative easing and concluded that many economists fear “the flood of cash has encouraged reckless financial behaviour and directed a firehose of money to emerging economies that cannot manage the cash.” Johnson understands the problem while offering no solution, while Stein does not understand the problem and gives an unstable solution.
Ultimately, neither candidate holds a candle to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s plan to make community college and public university free for families with income up to $125,000 through taxes for higher-income taxpayers. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has not presented a plan of his own, though he does agree that the federal government should not be making money off of student loans.
So, the media probably shouldn’t care more than it already does about Johnson or Stein’s plan for student debt. Kevin James, research fellow with the Center on Higher Education Reform at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote “in overhyping the issues facing this segment of the population, the media narrative around student debt often overlooks the struggles of other groups — like those with debt and no degree — who are often far worse off.”  James is not wrong that the media caters to what the college audience wants to hear. Democratic platforms have not been free of white lies and appeals to target demographics. Perhaps college students should stop mocking Republicans falling for Trump’s pandering while entrenched in the unique pandering brought on by talks of debt-free college.
Steins plan is unrealistic but we had no problem forgiving the debt of the bankers that crashed our economy? This btw did nothing for our economy or except keep the status quo in place. Investing in our younger generation and getting them out of debt will do wonders for economy from the bottom up instead of the top down.
Yup: revolution is bottom-up, not top-down! #bottomuprevolution
It is quite evident that the author of the article is a “Shill for Hill”. Stein understands the problem perfectly: there are millions upon millions of Americans with ridiculous, life-crippling debts foisted upon them by predatory financial institutions. Making community college free will not solve this. Hillary will not solve this. She is in the pocket of the same institutions which are currently ruining the lives of millions through their unethical practices. It is overwhelmingly reasonable to bail out student debt in the same manner as we did banker debt – making this out to be an unrealistic notion is unethical in the extreme. Why must we forced to bail out the richest in society, but not our most vulnerable in the same way?. And it is overwhelmingly reasonable to institute free tertiary education; the US the richest major country in the world. Countries with massively lower financial means manage to provide free University (e.g. Argentina, Czech Republic); it shouldn’t even be a question for a country like the US.
Headline……….Stein and Johnson offer no solution to student debt
and yet…….
Stein plans to “abolish student debt to free a generation of Americans from debt servitude” and “guarantee tuition-free, world-class public education from preschool through university.” Her plan is to bail out students with debt “through quantitative easing, the finance tool used to bail out the banks. This would be a huge stimulus for the economy, as young people are enabled to follow their dreams & re-imagine our future — as every new generation must.”
I suppose it is good enough for the fat cat banksters……..but not for struggling students……..
That is it really. Hillary is fine with bankers getting bailouts, but when it comes to the most vulnerable and exploited (in a financial sense), suddenly it’s just ipso facto “unrealistic”.

Photo courtesy of Madison Square GardenWork, work, work, work, work · Canadian rapper Drake (left) presented the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award to girlfriend Rihanna (right). The two collaborated together on the song “Work.”
The 2016 MTV Video Music Awards show re-emphasized the holistic and cultural visuals that accompany an artist’s musical compositions. Presented at Madison Square Garden, musicians paid tribute to the Big Apple by making New York City a symbol for home. In addition to the show’s diverse collection of awards, the unexpected revival of the Best Long Form Video award came from a 25-year evolution of the music scene. According to longtime VMAs executive producer Jesse Ignjatovic, the VMAs “[are] always trying to stay on the cusp and reflect culture and what artists are doing.”
Beyoncé, who won the Breakthrough Long Form Video Award for her visual album Lemonade, broke the record for most all-time VMA wins with 21 total Moonmen over the course of her career. While showcasing songs such as “Formation” in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and “Daddy Issues” to to tell a personal story, Lemonade is reflection of both Beyoncé’s personal experiences and contempoary culture. The visual album’s victory at the ceremony served as a reminder that music transcends beyond an artist’s voice.
Pleased by Beyoncé’s long-awaited win, Kanye West also unexpectedly featured his latest music video “Fade” from his album The Life of Pablo after shedding light on his erotic, contentious video for the track “Famous.”
“It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, us on the inside of the TV,” West said. As a headlining artist who has expanded his visual aesthetic to fashion, West spoke to the prominent position fame puts artists in as “the influence, the thought leaders” of the music industry.
Aside from the presentation of videos nominated for awards, the live performances also enhanced the audience’s perception of the artist’s music. Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj remodeled the center stage into their personal workout area while performing their sensual duet “Side to Side,” Rihanna brought the house down with an authentic club performance of her upbeat hit “Work” and Beyoncé reenacted a sweet medley of hits from Lemonade that covered sour topics such as Jay Z’s rumored infidelity.
As the show unfolded, pop music veteran Britney Spears performed her latest single “Make Me” with rapper G-Eazy, signaling the end of her nine-year hiatus from televised performances since the 2007 VMAs. Joe Jonas secured the acclaimed Best New Artist award with his band DNCE, whose members have been active in the music industry for the last 10 years.
The VMAs not only recognized its longtime favorites, but applauded newcomers such as Troye Sivan, Bryson Tiller and Alessia Cara. Rihanna stunned the crowds with four special performances at the show, and was presented with a Video Vanguard Award for her achievements in the music industry.  Rihanna’s boyfriend and rapper Drake presented the special honor to the singer after delivering a heartfelt speech about his admiration for her since 2005.
Rihanna herself shed light on achieving the musical American Dream as a foreigner: “All I could think of was my country … My success started as my dream, but now my success is not my own -—it’s my family’s, it’s my fans’, it’s my country’s, it’s the Caribbean as a whole, it’s women, it’s black women.”

The summer of 2005 was one of the best summers I’ve ever had. I had just finished my favorite year of school (third grade was all that and a bag of chips), and I was ready for watching sunsets at 9 p.m., Detroit Tigers games, sleeping over at friends’ houses and gluing my eyes to a TV day-in and day-out — all staples of a classic summer in the suburbs of Michigan.
Photo courtesy of Mariah CareyShake it off · Mariah Carey’s 10th studio album The Emancipation of Mimi earned 10 nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006.
I was also looking forward to seeing what the summer hits were going to be after a lackluster selection from 2004’s summer. Hoobastank’s “The Reason” and Alicia Key’s “If I Ain’t Got You” were, and still are, great songs to belt out at the top of your lungs in your car, but the rest of the hits at the time just fell flat for me. I needed something that would be synonymous with this summer, something that would send waves through the world of pop. Little did I know that Mariah Carey was making another album that year.
My mom is a Mariah Carey enthusiast, to put it lightly, so when The Emancipation of Mimi came out in April 2005, she was over the moon, to say the least. Her copy of the album found a comfy home in the CD player of her Ford Explorer for that entire summer. That album was in the CD player for months on end and never left, and The Emancipation of Mimi became the soundtrack to both of our lives that summer. Any activity we drove to, whether it be grocery shopping or a trip to the city, was accompanied by the soothing voice of Mariah Carey. I lost count of how many times I had heard that album from start to finish by mid-June, but I couldn’t get enough of it.
This album set a new bar for what an artist’s comeback album should be. Her last album, 2002’s Charmbracelet, was disappointing at best, leading fans and critics alike to say her time in the spotlight was over and that she needed to bow out with dignity. However, this album was a colossal pop hit, showcasing an older, more mature Mariah Carey who still had that same sparkle in her voice when she first started her music career. This album debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts and nearly achieved gold status the week it premiered. For an artist who was seemingly losing her place in the world of music and starting to fade away, Mariah Carey silenced the haters with this album.
Starting as a ’90s R&B megastar, her roots are perfectly meshed with the evolving pop sound of the time. Songs like “Joy Ride” and “Mine Again” are more akin to that ’90s R&B sound, complete with a slow-moving beat and long, drawn-out notes from Carey. Meanwhile, songs like “Your Girl” and my favorite track on the album “Say Somethin’” have a genuine pop sound that was characteristic of chart-toppers at the time, complete with a hard-hitting snare and a bumping bassline. Carey showed that she could find success in both genres and proved that she was an artist who could adapt to the changing sounds of music.
But without a doubt, her most impressive songs are the ones where Carey mixes her R&B prowess with her new pop sound to create a match made in heaven. “Shake It Off” is a fantastic song with a chopped-up beat that synergizes with Mariah Carey’s trademarked “whistle tone” and powerful voice that sings to your soul. This album also had Carey’s biggest hit of her career, “We Belong Together.” With a beat that puts hip-hop drums together with a soulful R&B piano and Carey’s sultry background vocals, this song, which spent 14 weeks at No. 1, is a testament to the new Mariah Carey. Fifteen years into her career, Carey was still finding paramount success and connecting to audiences with this sorrowful song.
For my mom, this album meant the return of one of her favorite artists, and she couldn’t have been happier about it. She loved the R&B aspects of the old Mariah Carey that she fell in love with in the ’90s, and the fact that it was performing so well commercially made her overjoyed. I can still picture her really getting into her impromptu karaoke sessions that were more along the lines of an imaginary concert at Madison Square Garden considering the amount of passion she put in.
As for me, I loved the modern twist on an old genre, the way Carey was able to mix a bit of the old with a bit of the new and really make this album appeal to a newer and older crowd. I had heard a few Mariah Carey songs here and there growing up, mostly because of my mom, and they were usually a hit or miss, but this album was something really special. Carey’s voice was something that astounded me at the time, especially when it was mixed the production on this album. The Neptunes’ production was essential to the success this album had, as well as a large majority of the other pop hits of the time, but that’s a different story for another time.
Mariah Carey turned me, a casual fan, into a fanatic, and my mom, a fanatic, into a worshipper with this album. I got my wish of having some great summer jams that year, since there were some great hits in addition to The Emancipation of Mimi. Whenever I listen to this album, I become 10-year-old me, sitting in the back of my mom’s black Explorer on the way to pick up some batteries at Best Buy. It was one of the better summers I’ve had in my life — the summer of Mariah Carey.

The Los Angeles music festival, FYF Fest, also known as F-ck Yeah Fest, took over Exposition Park last weekend for two nights of incredible artists and performers, including headliners LCD Soundsystem and Kendrick Lamar, and other acts like Tame Impala, Grimes, Beach House and Father John Misty.
Some of the best Saturday acts included Peter Bjorn and John, DIIV, Hot Chip and AIR, and the most popular stage, the Main Stage, consistently brought standout performances.
Taking over the main stage sunset slot was experimental dream pop queen Grimes, who brought a chilling, yet high-energy performance that featured dancers, incredible lighting and a special guest appearance by Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes on the track “SCREAM.” Also gracing the main stage was Tame Impala, who had unforgettable abstract projections that complimented their psychedelic rock sound. The band played old and new songs such as “Let it Happen.” The latest single from the album Currents, which was backed with pulsing animations of colorful rings and flashy moving lights, grooved seamlessly to the upbeat hit.
Headliner Kendrick Lamar closed out the night in style, playing popular songs like “Backseat Freestyle,” “King Kunta” and “m.A.A.d. City.” His anthem “Alright” was a crowd favorite, which had attendees singing along to every word. His performance featured black and white videos of historical events, abstract images and funny clips like Barack Obama and Ellen Degeneres dancing, ultimately contributing to a complex and memorable performance.
Sunday at FYF did not disappoint either, especially with performances by Blood Orange, Father John Misty and Mac Demarco. One of the best performances of the night was Beach House, who brought an elaborate production of projections, starry lights and carefully-crafted lighting design that matched perfectly with their dreamy vocals and reverberant guitar riffs. Additionally, LCD Soundsystem closed the Main Stage Sunday night, ending FYF with a bang. From the incredible videos, lighting and disco balls to the upbeat synths, harmonies and legendary melodies, LCD Soundsystem gave an explosive performance that got the entire crowd dancing.
However, what seemed like a normal music festival took a sharp turn for the worse on Saturday as the festival faced a major issue of actually getting attendees inside the grounds. Hundreds of people lined up along Vermont Avenue, waiting almost two hours in the hot sun for a chance to finally make it past security. This became a major issue for both festival attendees and artists performing at the venue.
“The signage around the Coliseum was nearly nonexistent, causing confusion and misdirection as people searched for the entrance,” said Mack Cooper, a senior studying music industry who attended both days of FYF. “The decision to have one entrance seemed to only add stress and danger to the ingress process, forcing people to miss full sets, and bands to play to a very limited crowd.”
All in all, the carefully curated lineup at FYF Fest drew a huge crowd this year and will likely draw more fans next year, but it seems like the festival needs to seriously rethink its infrastructure in order to continue running smoothly for years to come.

After facing discrimination in their home country, two Tanzanian sisters were granted asylum in the U.S. with the help of two USC Gould School of Law students.
Sisters Bibiana and Tindi Mashamba were born with albinism, a rare genetic condition characterized by absence of pigment in the skin. In Tanzania, some people associate the condition with witchcraft and believe that the body parts of albinos carry magical powers and have monetary value, according to the Los Angeles Times.
When she was just 9 years old, Bibiana’s leg and two of her fingers were cut off and sold. The sisters initially came to the United States on medical visas and reached out to the USC Gould School of Law when their visas were close to expiring. After receiving asylum, Bibiana and Tindi will attend school in Ojai, California, this fall. Both girls hope to use their education to help other albinos in Tanzania.
Gould law students Amy Stern and Elena Babakhanyan took on the case, under the supervision of Jean Reisz, co-director of Gould’s Immigration Clinic. The clinic allows students to serve as lead attorneys on cases, under the guidance of a supervising attorney, such as Reisz. The clinic has represented clients from all over the world.
“This is the first case where we’ve represented someone who was persecuted on account of albinism. We have represented clients who have had similar trauma, whether it was torture, rape or similar beatings, and have represented clients who are persecuted due to their membership in a particular social group,” Reisz said.
Amy Stern first took on the case as a third-year law student working for USC Gould School of Law’s Immigration Clinic.
“Initially, I was so surprised that I had never before heard that there was this unimaginable persecution of people with albinism going on in countries all over Africa,” Stern said. “And because this persecution is very well-documented, there was a lot of support for their case.”
Stern did much of the preliminary work, including preparing the asylum papers, interviewing the girls, gathering evidence and writing statements. Stern submitted their asylum application in May 2016, just a week before she graduated from law school.
“When I met the girls, I was just so inspired by them because upon meeting them you would never know that they suffered these horrible abuses their entire life since they are just so positive,” Stern said.
Elena Babakhanyan, who took over the case after Stern graduated, was also inspired by the Mashamba sisters.
“It obviously was a horrific thing that happened to these girls, but when you meet them, they have this very positive spirit, and it is so inspirational because they were so strong and courageous,” Babakhanyan said. “[The sisters] were ready to move forward and get educated and go back and help other albinos.”
Babakhanyan, now a second-year law student, worked on the case over the summer and prepared the sisters for their asylum interview.
For Jean Reisz, the case is a win-win, as the Mashamba received asylum and her USC Gould law students were able to work on an important case.
“Winning cases like this makes me happy that my students can see the good they can do with the law degree. You can change the course of a person’s life,” Reisz said.  “We get to help these girls, and my students learned a valuable lesson and, hopefully, will continue to use their law degree for good in the world.”
Stern spent a total of about 80 pro bono hours on the case and considers representing Babiana and Tindi the highlight of her budding legal career.
“Being able to do work with the girls and see their case through to their being granted asylum is the most rewarding and memorable work I will ever do throughout my legal career, and my legal career hasn’t even started yet,” she said.

Someone once told me “I don’t trust people who don’t love pizza” and that connected to me on such a personal level. Jokes aside, pizza is one of the rare foods that appeal to all ages and we here at USC are fortunate enough to have great offerings nearby to satisfy our taste buds. Whether you’re looking for a quick grab or a place to hang out and chill with your friends, these are the places to experience.
Rosso Oro’s Pizzeria
Rosso Oro’s has a create-your-own system. The food here is delicious and if you’re looking to try a variety of choices, they give you the option to order just a slice rather than a whole pizza. Go with friends and check out the 20-foot shuffleboard. Game nights, great music, and amazing pizza makes Rosso Oro’s a must-have experience.

Bottega Louie
Landed your dream internship? Want to celebrate a great achievement or go all out and enjoy an evening on the town? Bottega Louie is the place to go. Located in Downtown LA and touted to be one of LA’s best Italian restaurants, Bottega Louie exudes a fine ambience with its tall ceilings. Although more expensive than the pizza joints closet to USC, the food is delicious with excellent service and they offer a brilliant dessert assortment.

Pizza Studio
Pizza Studio’s pizzas go through a conventional oven; hence they taste differently from Blaze’s wood-fired pizzas. You can select all different kinds of crusts and toppings. I’ve been told the rosemary base is a must-try! For the less creative, Pizza Studio offers a pre-made menu of tried and trued combinations.

Pasta Roma
Looking to not burn a hole in your pocket? Walking distance from campus, Pasta Roma is student-friendly and has bagged great reviews from students at USC. It also offers free delivery up to one and a half miles; hence you should consider them while throwing a party at home with friends. For the health-conscious students, gluten-free options are available, too.
