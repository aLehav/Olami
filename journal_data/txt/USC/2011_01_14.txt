Phone, email and Internet connectivity were lost this morning in select areas on the Health Sciences Campus because of a flood, but most problems have now been fixed.
A pipe was inadvertently cut, which flooded the vault where IT equipment and applications are kept, according to HSC media relations spokeswoman Leslie Ridgeway. About 100 phones are still undergoing repairs.
USC Trojans Alert issued a notification to both campuses shortly after 10 a.m., saying response teams were working to regain connection.
By 12:53 p.m., technicians had been able to restore all Internet and email connectivity and most phone service. Some phone lines in the Health Care Consultation Center (HCC) and Health Care Consultation Center II (HCT) buildings, however, are still experiencing service problems.
Technicians are expected to continue making repairs in order to restore full service as soon as possible.
Anyone still having connectivity or phone problems should contact the ITS Helpline at (213) 740-5555.
Says a pipe was inadvertently cut…
so what caused a flood?

Through an emphasis on instrumentals and harmonic vocals, Grizzly Bear strays from the common place pop stars, that dominate our radios and embraces music as an art form beautiful in its simplicity.
Grizzly Bear | Creative Commons
In essence, they go back to the basics.
Light, twangy and chipper guitars capture the ups of Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy’s (Michelle Williams) relationship in Blue Valentine, while the piano and vocals complement each other in a perfectly melancholic manner, flooding the listener with emotions and allowing the moviegoer to feel all the heartbreak that the couple experiences.
Grizzly Bear avoids crazy, sex-infused lyrics and attention tactics, instead opting for perfected choral elements, similar to those of Fleet Foxes. Shift (Alternate Version), captures and sets the tone for the devastating pinnacle of the drama while a montage depicts the “better and worse” of the relationship as the couple contemplates divorce.
Whimsical whistling and delightful chimes establish a carefree vibe and remind the viewer and listener of happier times.
On the other hand, the emotional, harmonic and musical build up, in addition to lyrics like “when push comes to shove this is getting old” allow the moviegoer to comprehend the ultimate collapse of the marriage.
Grizzly Bear stands on its own as a unique and independent band; however, its integration with Blue Valentine elevates their status from relaxed and melodic up-and-comers to a deep, heartfelt, musically gifted force.
Read a review of Blue Valentine here.

What do you get when you bring together new musical instruments, technological products and music industry professionals with their game faces on all in one place?
The 2011 NAMM Show held at the Anaheim Convention Center on January 13 through the 16th.
NAMM, which stands for the National Association of Music Merchants, puts on trade shows in hopes of uniting merchants to strengthen the technical state of the music industry. Each day is filled with opportunities for retailers to showcase their latest instruments, recording equipment and an array of other products used throughout the process of creating future groundbreaking music. Musical performances and seminars focusing on everything from products to ways to enrich one’s company are also put on throughout each day.
While you may be saying, “Man, I have to go to this,” the NAMM Show is an event most people can only dream about going to. It is so exclusive that it’s not open to anyone besides NAMM members, merchandisers, those directly invited and people lucky enough to score passes from a friend who happens to have a few extra. 
Becoming a member isn’t the easiest task to achieve either. They only accept people from a certain list of companies that meet the requirements of manufacturing, distributing, and retailing musical products. If you’re a person who has been dreaming about going into a career surrounding this type of work, it would not hurt to look into the companies on that special list. 
All in all, NAMM showcases the attempts of the music world to keep growing technologically and keep the industry alive.

This year’s award season has gone something like a game of dominos, tipping in favor of David Fincher’s The Social Network at the pace of Aaron Sorkin’s rapid-fire dialogue via the lips of Jesse Eisenberg. The steely commentary on Mark Zuckerberg’s social media machine has won top prizes from the leading film critic circles, including Los Angeles, Boston, Washington D.C. and the National Board of Review, with a slight bump in an otherwise flawless path in New York (there, the film picked up Picture and Director, but yielded a screenplay win to The Kids Are All Right).  
 
As we head into the major league of shiny statue presentations with the Sunday, Jan. 16 broadcast of the Golden Globes, one question remains for filmgoers and critics alike: Will the deconstruction of Mark Zuckerberg’s social media machine continue its pummeling winning streak or fall short of the stage of the Kodak Theater?
 
While much of the American public will be tuning in on Sunday to catch their favorite A-list celebrities with a bit too much to drink, the real determinant for the Best Picture race is not the Golden Globes, which has had its esteem in question for years now, but the Directors Guild of America Awards.
 
Monday’s announcement of the DGA nominees for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film brought little surprises to this season’s Oscar race — what’s shaping up to be a flashy, testosterone-laden match-up. Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan), David Fincher (The Social Network), Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech), Christopher Nolan (Inception) and David O. Russell (The Fighter) are the five directors up for the prestigious honor.  
 
For the last three years, the winner of the DGA award has also won the Academy Award for Best Director, with the director’s film following suit and capturing Best Picture. Last year, the five directors nominated for a DGA award aligned perfectly with the Oscar nominations — with Kathryn Bigelow repeating her DGA win on the Kodak stage. A win for Fincher at 2011 DGAs could easily solidify not only his position as the Best Director front-runner, but also The Social Network for Best Picture.
 
The Academy, however, is known to be a fickle bunch.
 
Nolan is perhaps the darkest horse in the race. Although a DGA favorite — he was previously nominated for Momento and The Dark Knight — Nolan seems to be a polarizing force with Academy members, failing to capture an Oscar nominations for directing despite the box office and, oftentimes, critical success of his films. If the unusually high concept of Inception does not bode well with Academy voters, Nolan might be switched out for Danny Boyle (127 Hours), whose drama about an adventurer’s unfortunate plight was better received by critics and has been garnering attention for its lead actor, James Franco.
 
The lack of a DGA nomination, however, does diminish Boyle’s chance for a second Oscar nomination, and also sets the Coen Brothers further back from the Kodak Theater. The Coen Brothers’ conventional western True Grit has endured a bumpy road this award season, snubbed entirely by the Golden Globes yet receiving 11 nominations from the Critics Choice Awards. The large box office numbers ($110 million as of this week), stellar acting team and devoted following of the Coen Brothers are currently keeping True Grit afloat in the Oscars race.  
 
When looking at the stats, however, the DGA award is Fincher’s to lose, with Aronofsky and Russell on his heels. If Zuckerberg was the face of social media in 2010, then Fincher was certainly the face of filmmaking.
 
The Directors Guild of America Awards will be announced in a ceremonial dinner on Jan. 29 in Los Angeles.

As the soldout crowd at the Galen Center chanted down the final seconds to USC’s fourth straight win over UCLA on Sunday, Trojan players, students and fans alike all reveled in the fact that they have owned their bitter crosstown rivals for the last two years.
Surging · Junior forward Nikola Vucevic has been instrumental in  USC basketball’s strong play as of late, averaging 16.1 points per game. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
But something was lost amid that celebration. Something bigger than beating a mediocre UCLA team.
And then it dawned on me. This wasn’t just a win over the Bruins for USC. This was a statement to the entire Pac-10 conference. This was the USC basketball team’s way of saying brand name doesn’t carry as much weight as it used to. Sure, in the grand scheme of things UCLA basketball’s brand will always eclipse that of USC basketball, but not as much in the last two years. With the demise of UCLA, and the entire Pac-10 for that matter, this is the perfect opportunity that only comes around once in a generation, like a really rainy L.A. December, for USC basketball to assert itself, not only in Los Angeles, but on the West Coast.
The typically strong Pac-10 is suffering through a few down years. Currently, it only has one ranked team, and barely at that, and the conference is just begging for someone to take it by the leash and lead it. With a blowout win against No. 14 Texas — whose only other two losses have come against top 10 foes — as well as a quality win on the road at Tennessee and a heartbreaking two point loss at No. 3 Kansas, USC has shown it has the ability to be that team. The only thing holding it back is the terrible losses to teams nobody knew existed (I’m sure I’m not the only one who thought when the Trojans were playing Rider, they were playing former NBA player Isaiah Rider and not a school).
In fact, the Pac-10 has performed so poorly that a team from the Mountain West Conference is the best team on the West Coast. No disrespect to San Diego State, but its basketball accolades are lacking.
Knowing that no school is dramatically outshining any others the way UCLA did for ages, this is the perfect chance for USC go out on the recruiting trail and bring in top notch players who even as little as five years ago probably didn’t know USC had a basketball team. USC coach Kevin O’Neill is already beginning to do that, signing small forward Byron Wesley, who rates 90 out of 100 points on ESPN’s recruiting scale, and point guard Alexis Moore, who rates 88 points. Both these players, as well as Aaron Fuller, a junior transfer from Iowa and winner of the All-Big Ten honorable mention last year, will look to steady a program that has been widely inconsistent in the last
decade.
Nobody expected USC, who was predicted to finish sixth in the Pac-10 this year in the preseason media poll, to rebound from its self-imposed sanctions this quickly. This time last year, the basketball team was learning it couldn’t partake in any postseason tournament and an eight-game winning streak quickly turned south. There’s no doubt that a typically strong Pac-10 conference would’ve swallowed USC and prevented it from making much progress in the near future.
But O’Neill has done a great job with the pieces he’s been given. He’s got a transfer who’s given this team the go-to perimeter scorer it was lacking and a big man who I’m convinced is not among the nation’s premier players because announcers are scared of pronouncing his name.
So not only is this a great chance for USC to cement itself in the upper tier of Pac-10 basketball, but an opportunity to shed all the negative publicity on the program as well. There’s no doubt O.J. Mayo was a big reason for the team’s success three years ago, and USC violated rules to bring him here. Did the same happen with the next year’s sensation, DeMar DeRozan? There’s no evidence to say that but he might not have ever chosen USC had Mayo not played with the Trojans and brought them to the spotlight.
Even though USC has been to the tournament and even been ranked within the last few years, it was under a cloud of illegality. The Trojans are winning again, and have a great opportunity to continue to do so under clean conditions. O’Neill is running a squeaky clean program, and if USC can prove it can consistently win without violating rules, then there’s a strong chance it could contend for a Pac-10 title every year in the near future.
This might sound too optimistic and rah-rah to some people, and that’s understandable. The Trojans haven’t really proven anything yet and it is still early in the Pac-10 slate. But the opportunity is there and probably won’t be again until Halley’s Comet appears in the night sky — in 2061. To the Mayans, though, that will be too late.

With a recent sweep of UCSB under its belt, the USC men’s swim and dive team will be sending nine representatives — eight swimmers and one diver ­— to compete at the Southern Methodist University Invitational this weekend.
The SMU Invite is a long-standing competition in which six teams, including host SMU, are invited to attend. Michigan and Florida will be among the six squads attending the invite. Both the Gators and the Wolverines were in the top 10 at the 2010 NCAA Championships, along with SMU.
“Our team is coming off a tough two weeks of dedicated training over the holidays and while a bit tired from the challenge, I am certain they are ready for the competitive challenge that they face at the SMU Classic,” USC coach David Salo said.
While in the past the Trojans have gone to the SMU Invite without a diver, they will be completing the package this year by sending senior Steven Starks in addition to seven swimmers. Joining Starks will be some of the team’s most promising swimmers — freshmen Chase Bloch, Dimitri Colupaev, Vlad Morozov, Jack Wagner; sophomores Clement Lefert and Alex Lendrum; junior Pat White and senior co-captain Dillon Connolly will all be participating as well.
Even though four out of eight swimmers going to the invitational are freshmen, the Trojans will be tough contenders this weekend because of the intensity of the young talent they have.
“I think the freshmen have done pretty well so far,” Bloch added. “We were a highly recruited class and I think we are living up to that to a certain extent but we have a ways to go to finish strong.”
The ultimate goal of the men’s swim team was clear when they started their season and this invitational is a stepping-stone towards achieving it according to Bloch.
“Our goal from the beginning of the season was to finish top five,” he said. “We started off ranked 14th or 15th and we have definitely climbed and are working towards our goal.”
After this invitational both the men and women’s teams will compete against Cal and Stanford in two highly anticipated dual meets. While highly ranked, the Trojan teams anticipate a challenge in the two schools from northern California.
“All of us [USC, Cal, Stanford] should be top five, but we should hopefully beat them,” Connolly said. “It should potentially be really close.”
Even with two weeks of preparation and no resting period behind them, the Trojans feel optimistic about their performances to come at the 29th annual SMU Invitational. They will start competition on Friday, and it will continue until Saturday.

The No. 2 USC men’s tennis team begins its first tournament
of the season today at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Westlake, Calif. The tournament will run through the weekend, and much like last year, the Trojans enter the season hoping to defend their back-to-back NCAA titles.
Heavy shoulders · USC will lean on the leadership and experience of junior Steve Johnson, who ranks as the nation’s No. 6 singles player and is presently ranked as the tournament’s top seed. -  Daily Trojan file photo  
The tournament remains a good opportunity for the team to show their competition what they have been preparing for in the offseason, but it will also serve as an early testament to their level of preparedness for the remaining slate.
“Personally the most difficult part of this match is the pressure to start the season strong,” junior Daniel Nguyen said. “The tournament will be tough because for most of us this will be our first few matches of the season.”
The importance of starting strong is perhaps of particular importance, given the high standards the team has set for itself through the success of the past few seasons.
“I think coming back from winter break strong and making a statement by doing well and having one of our players win will be the most difficult and most important,” freshman Michael Grant said.
USC is returning five players from its 2010 national championship team in seniors Jaak Poldma and Peter Lucassen, juniors Daniel Nguyen and Steve Johnson and sophomore JT Sundling.
These veterans will have help from a cast of players, including freshmen Michael Grant and Ray Sarmiento, both of whom had strong fall seasons.
USC also recently signed freshman Emilio Gomez from Ecuador to add depth to the team.
“We’ve been lucky to have the depth necessary to go far, and it looks like we have it again this year,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “When we get to that point in the season where we’re playing really big matches, we have some experience on our side and we really hope to use that. The last thing we can do is try to maintain what we did.
“We don’t just want to maintain; we’ve got to get better and better and better and keep proving ourselves. Our competition is out there trying to get better and we need to match that passion.”
The path to victory will be a tough one, and it all begins Friday.
“Every year, every team wants to win it all,” Smith said. “We’ve been pretty fortunate the last two years to do it. It’s definitely our goal again, and we’ll go for it with every ounce of our beings.”

The No. 19 USC women’s tennis team will compete this weekend at two competitions to kick off its season: the Freeman Memorial Women’s Tennis Championships hosted by the University of Nevada, in Las Vegas and the National Colliegate Tennis Classic in La Quinta, Calif.
The Women of Troy will be competing against some of the best teams in the country at the Freeman Memorial tournament: No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 Florida, No. 5 UCLA and No. 6 North Carolina will all be participating.
Despite many higher ranked opponents participating, senior Maria Sanchez tops the singles lineup at this weekend’s competition in Las Vegas, ranking third in the nation in singles. Freshmen Kaitlyn Christian and Hayley Miller and senior Cristala Andrews will also be participating at the Freeman Memorial competition.
At the NCTC, the first major invitational college tournament of the season, both men’s and women’s programs from across the country will participate in what is known as “the Wimbledon of College Tennis.” The competition features the top six men’s and women’s teams, along with top-ranked individual players from the leading universities across the country.
Sophomore Danielle Lao, the ITA Southwest Regional champion in the fall and ranked No. 10 nationally, along with sophomore Valeria Pulido, junior Alison Ramos and senior Lyndsay Kinstler will represent USC at the NCTC.
The team is hopeful that these tournaments, their last individual ones this season, will be successful.
“Our belief in one another has never been stronger and with that alone we’ve put ourselves in a great position to compete the best we can, whether it’s in this individual tournament coming up or a dual match,” Lao said.
After the Freeman Memorial and NCTC, the Women of Troy will begin dual season, which they are anticipating will go well based on their performances so far this season. In 2010, the team reached the NCAA tournament once again, finishing the year 14-10 overall.
“[The NCTC] is our last individual tournament for a while. This will serve as tune-up before the dual matches begin,” Ramos said. “I can’t wait to get going with the tournament so that we can go into dual season fine-tuned and prepared.”
After this weekend’s competitions, the team will look towards Jan. 18, its next opportunity to compete, where it will face Cal State Northridge in a dual meet at USC’s own Mark’s Stadium.
“We’re excited for the spring to start and couldn’t be hungrier to do well,” Lao said.

After exorcising their past demons with a workman-like three-set win against a No. 12 Cal State Northridge team they had not beaten in 17 matches, the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team returns to action tonight against No. 11 Long Beach State.
Undoubtedly, the Trojans’ first conference win of the season against a team that unceremoniously knocked them out of the first round of the MPSF tournament last season should help the team’s psyche, allowing the players to move past last year’s unfulfilling postseason cameo.
“We finally got the monkey off our backs,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “We haven’t beaten them in eight years, and I know it was a big win for juniors, seniors and the Trojan Family.”
As the Trojans will face an opponent of similar caliber tonight, they cannot bask in this long overdue victory. In fact, Long Beach State edged out No. 3 Pepperdine in five sets to stun the Waves on Wednesday, putting the Trojans on upset alert.
Long Beach State, led by junior opposite Jim Baughman who recorded a match-high 21 kills against Pepperdine, will run its offense at a fast tempo, featuring several players with various service repertoires.
“They are going to try to run more back row stuff, and they are going to serve really well,” said coach Bill Ferguson. “We are going to have to really be on our game, and make a lot of adjustments as the match goes on.”
Ferguson did not wish to dwell too much on scouting reports, however, as he is still in the process of configuring his lineups and refining his system. A common refrain among Ferguson and players alike is that the blocking needs to improve.
“We need to continue to get better blocking the ball,” Ferguson said. “We can talk about scouting reports, but for the most part, the most important thing is us and if we’re improving.”
If the Trojans continue to serve well, they can disrupt their opponents’ offenses and force them into predictable returns. They will also need to demonstrate the same fervor for digging tough shots that they did against Cal State Northridge.
Paramount to that effort is freshman libero Henry Cassiday, who dug 13 shots in Wednesday’s game.
“I think the most notable performance was by [Cassiday],” McKibbin said. “It was his first start, and he played really well. He’s really been working on his defense, and he passed really well. That’s one of our key success factors. If we can pass the ball, then we can run a really good offense.”
First serve will be at the Galen Center at 7 p.m.

Former USC wide receiver Markeith Ambles, who was dismissed from the team in November, has rejoined the program, according to his personal Twitter account.
Ambles told Bryan Fischer of CBSSports.com on Thursday that he was on a flight bound for Los Angeles and would be rejoining the team upon his arrival.
A native of McDonough, Ga., Ambles had a rocky freshman season with the Trojans, appearing in four games and totaling only one catch for three yards in a 50-16 blowout win over Washington State.
Furthermore, the former five-star wideout was also suspended indefinitely in late October after several late arrivals to mandatory team functions. During training camp in August, Ambles, along with freshman running back Dillon Baxter, was disciplined for similar incidents of “tardiness” and spent an entire practice session doing rollovers.
Ambles was one of the signature signees of USC’s No. 1 2010 recruiting class, according to Rivals.com. Ranked as the third best receiver nationally and 24th overall, he originally committed to the University of Tennessee in 2009 when current USC coach Lane Kiffin was still with the Volunteers. When Kiffin departed for USC, Ambles also changed his commitment, signing a letter of intent to join the Trojans on Feb. 3, 2010.
Along with Baxter and wide receivers Kyle Prater and Robert Woods, Ambles was one of four five-star recruits from USC’s 2010 class.
Lane would never have let him come back unless he is sure that this guy will fly right this time. He will be on a short leash and will not be allowed to be a “cancer” on the team. Give the coaching staff some credit and be confident at their decision. Otherwise, go root for UCLA! They have a much bigger mess.
Looks like Ambles and Kiffin are two desperados.  Will USC lower the price of season tickets???
Under normal conditions, I may be inclined to agree with Steve, above. However, with the departure of Collier and Ayles, we need as many bodies as we can get in. Second chances are a good thing. He still has the potential to be one of the top receivers we have, so if he’s willing to put in the work, I’m willing to let him be part of the team. Worst case scenario is that he becomes a good service team member to help out our defense.
Pete Carroll stopped recruiting him for a good reason. This is a truly dumb move on the part of the coaching staff taking him back. Hope this is a false scenario created by Ambles.

Just when it seemed like poor shooting would doom the USC women’s basketball team, Briana Gilbreath got hot.
Down 58-51, the sharpshooting junior guard knocked down consecutive three-pointers to pull the Women of Troy (11-4, 3-1) within one point.  The teams traded baskets the rest of the way in a game that wasn’t decided until Oregon guard Nia Jackson missed a layup in the final seconds, preserving a 79-76 win for the Women of Troy.
Gilbreath poured in 26 points for USC — with 20 coming after intermission — and added seven rebounds and four steals despite being plagued all game by foul trouble.
Freshman forward Cassie Harberts scored 11 points and grabbed 18 rebounds for the Women of Troy, who outrebounded Oregon 56-42 and held a 23-12 edge in offensive rebounds.
“I knew I had to rebound to help the team tonight,” Harberts said.  “Our guards had a size advantage which helped [all of us out].”
USC knocked off one of the highest-scoring teams in the nation despite shooting just 36 percent from the field.  After the game, USC coach Michael Cooper credited his player’s resolve for allowing them to rally back from a double-digit deficit in the second half.
“I like our toughness and think again that goes back to our preseason schedule and the team’s we played,” he said.  “That has given us something and gotten us ready for conference play.”
Oregon led 45-35 before the Women of Troy went on a 12-0 run that gave them their first lead since the midpoint of the first half.
USC held the Ducks nearly 10 points below their season average and frustrated Amanda Johnson, the conference’s leading scorer.
Sloppy play marred the first 20 minutes of action.  USC trailed 37-30 and connected on just 11 of its 38 field goal attempts.  The Ducks were barely better at 33 percent, but hit nine three-pointers in the half.
Oregon jumped out to an early 9-2 lead on a trio of three-pointers before Gemelos came off the bench and sparked USC with five quick points.  From there, the lead seesawed back and forth for the rest of the half before Oregon pulled away late with an 11-4 run.
For the half, Gemelos led the Women of Troy with eight points off the bench.  The USC starters combined to shoot just 6-24 from the field in the half.
With the victory, USC moved to 6-0 on the season at the Galen Center.
