The No. 8 USC women’s volleyball team remains undefeated after beating the Virginia Cavaliers in consecutive sets, 25-15, 25-16, 25-16, on Friday night.

Sophomore outside hitter Katie Fuller led the team with 11 kills in the match, 10 of which came in the first set.
“Going into this match, you feel really comfortable. I’ve got my team,” Fuller said. “We’ve been practicing really hard, and I honestly could not do this without them.”
Both Fuller and junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter hit .500 in the match. Jupiter recorded 10 kills and is now only 40 away from reaching 1,000 career kills.
“I think we did a really good job executing tonight and putting the ball away,” Fuller said.
The Women of Troy have played consistently well on offense this season, but it has been defense that has given the Women of Troy a little more difficulty.
“I think our defense is definitely one of the things we have to focus on every game,” junior setter Kendall Bateman said.
USC coach Mick Haley, who has been stressing defense as one of the areas his team needs to improve in, seemed pleased with Friday’s effort.
“[Virginia] present[s] a lot of problems with block timing, and I thought we did a pretty admirable job,” Haley said.
Freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard recorded four kills and a season-high three service aces. Not only did she pose a major problem for Virginia, she caught the attention of her coach as well.
“When she brings the serve to go with her game like that … she’s just huge up there in the front when she dominates,” Haley said. “I think she’s really put some heat on to be a starter.”
Haley has repeatedly changed up his lineup so far this season and utilized his deep bench, which consists of six freshmen. It appears, however, he might be closer to finding a more permanent rotation.
“I think I like the lineup pretty good now. I like it better than I did a week ago,” said Haley, who later added, “I like everything we’re doing right now.”
It’s not surprising to hear he is pleased with his team, as the Women of Troy are now 7-0 and have completed 3-0 sweeps against five of their opponents. These accomplishments are not going unnoticed — a large crowd was on hand at the Galen Center for the match, as many Trojan fans came to “White out the Cavs.”
“I think having a big crowd and a lot of energy and everyone cheering, it really helps us kind of keep our composure and compete at the top level — get that adrenaline going and really execute,” Fuller said.
The Women of Troy will next play three games this weekend at the Fresno State Invitational. They will not play at the Galen Center again until Sept. 24, when they open Pac-10 play against crosstown rival UCLA.
Thank you for the stories on volleyball.  You have a great team!

Rock ‘n’ roll and activism are not new phenomena. From protest songs of the 1960s to modern foundations such as To Write Love On Her Arms, music has played an important role in raising awareness of social problems. For the Rockstar Energy Drink UPROAR Festival, the issue being addressed is child abduction.
Rock royalty · UPROAR Festival participants include popular metal acts such as Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold, Stone Sour, Halestorm, Hellyeah and Hail the Villain. The city-touring festival will feature these acts and will also donate some of the proceeds to Child Find of America. - Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan 
The UPROAR team has partnered with Child Find of America, a non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention and investigation of kidnapping cases as well as helping the families of victims. Together they have developed an awareness campaign, including covering tour buses with photos of missing children and a text message-based donation system. A portion of UPROAR ticket sale proceeds go to Child Find of America as well.
This partnership came about after John Reese, co-founder of UPROAR and father of three, expressed concern for abduction.
“After the Chelsea King tragedy, we made a conscious decision that we were going to make strong efforts to help ensure that something like that doesn’t happen again,” Reese said in a press release. “Working with and supporting Child Find of America is something that is very near and dear to our hearts.”
Executive Director of Child Find of America Donna Linder also expressed her excitement about the partnership. She is said she is looking forward to “opening an avenue to offer prevention and safety tips to a difficult-to-reach age demographic.”
This is the UPROAR festival’s first run, but not Reese’s first experience with festivals. Along with Vans Warped Tour mastermind Kevin Lyman, Reese also co-founded the Rockstar Mayhem Festival, which operates during the summer season.
Though Mayhem carried heavier artists such as Slayer and Rob Zombie, UPROAR is more radio-rock friendly. The lineup boasts headliners Disturbed and Avenged Sevenfold, both widely successful bands with plenty of fresh material to perform. Each band’s new album has received generally positive reviews and demonstrate growth for both acts since their respective starts in the late ’90s.
Disturbed is one of the top-selling hard rock acts in recent decades, selling more than 11 million albums and counting worldwide. The recently released Asylum is the band’s fourth consecutive album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart. The band has been a friend to Reese for several years, taking part in past legs of Mayhem and producing the Music as a Weapon tour together.
Nightmare, the new disc from Southern California natives Avenged Sevenfold, also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart. Making the album proved to be a difficult time for the band, as its drummer passed away before recording was complete.
“After recently finishing up our new record we were not sure if we were going to continue touring,” lead singer M. Shadows said on the UPROAR website. “We got a call from our friends at UPROAR and decided this would be the best way to introduce our fans to the new album.”
Playing alongside the two powerhouses on the main stage is Grammy-nominated Stone Sour and up-and-coming East Coast outfit Halestorm. On the accompanying Jägermeister Mobile Stage, bands Hellyeah, Airbourne, Hail The Villain and New Medicine will perform. The UPROAR festival will also feature one different Jägermeister Battle of the Bands winner in each city.
As if these hard-hitting artists aren’t enough to fulfill one’s quota for intensity, the festival is also holding a wrestling tournament. Sponsored by the Blue Collar Wrestling Alliance, there will be more than 200 matches at the 36 stops where top wrestlers from the Alliance will face off. After the tour’s seven-week run, the athlete who has conquered all others will be deemed king of the tournament.
In order to experience the full effect of the UPROAR festival, arriving to the show early is key. Activities will occur throughout the late afternoon to keep fans busy, including the wrestling matches, band signings, clothing and instrument vendors. The festival will make a stop at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine, Calif., on Friday. Tickets range from $20 to $79 and can be purchased on the tour’s official website, rockstaruproar.com.

It’s finally fall, and you know what that means: good TV.  Though you might have spent the summer happily stuffing your DVR space with delightfully guilty pleasures, such as MTV’s Jersey Shore and USA’s Covert Affairs, the fall is when the networks hit their stride.
Here’s a collection of new shows that might just tickle your fancy.
Boardwalk Empire
Sept. 19 on HBO at 9 p.m.
Combine Prohibition, Martin Scorsese and Steve Buscemi, plop them into a lush, period setting and you get a very expensive series. This much-buzzed-about organized-crime drama, however, seems like it’ll give viewers something different, smart, sinister and, thankfully, vampire-free.
Hawaii Five-0
Sept. 20 on CBS at 10 p.m.
The remake of this campy 1970s cop show promises a sexier, modern version. Though it’s hard to say whether or not the show will actually be any good or have the old-school charm of the original, the splashy promos do feature a very attractive cast.
$#*! My Dad Says
Sept. 23 on CBS at 8:30 p.m.
The fact that a Twitter feed with a cult-like following inspired a sitcom might deeply disturb some, but those familiar with the goofy title character will have a half an hour of pure, unadulterated William Shatner — which might still disturb some.
Law & Order: Los Angeles
Sept. 29 on NBC at 10 p.m.
Murder, mystery, legal action — all taking place near USC. Expect long, gritty shots of dirty Downtown L.A. street corners, the sounds of gavels and a very bald Corey Stoll.
Conan
Nov. 8 on TBS at 11 p.m.
Team Coco or not, the jokester’s new show will give the wronged host a chance to use some four-letter words at a nervous America. The results should be nothing short of satisfying.
Sarah Palin’s Alaska
Nov. 14 on TLC at 9 p.m.
Nothing is more American than turning on the television to watch a vice presidential nominee shoot a bear on a reality show that’s right after 19 Kids & Counting. A must see, no matter what your political preference.
i love tv. Best cure for any hangover.
with or without Zack Galifianakis

For once, it seemed as if the future for the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team looked a little hazy.
With the departures of eight seniors and an opening slate of games that featured two Division III opponents, few knew how the Trojans (4-0, 1-0) would respond to their first real test of the season, a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation home opener against No. 10 Long Beach State followed by a road trip at No. 8 Loyola Marymount.
USC coach Jovan Vavic said he felt his youthful bunch needed time to adapt to the rigors of top-flight Division I competition. Several players readily admitted to a lack of experience. And the pollsters were simultaneously in agreement, placing the Trojans below teams  such as California and UCLA despite winning consecutive national championships in 2008 and 2009.
But none of that mattered  Saturday or Sunday, as USC cruised to a 16-4 victory over Long Beach State and edged a 10-5 win over LMU, helping to quiet some of the critics who were emphatic that Vavic’s bunch was due for a dropoff in 2010.
“We were much fresher as a team,” Vavic said. “We were tired at times last week. This week, we played with much more energy and our counterattacks were huge in both games.”
If a quick glance at the scoreboard reveals anything, offense was at a premium Saturday, as the Trojans tallied 16 goals against a 49ers team dressing a total of just 14 players.
With a sizeable advantage in terms of depth, USC got off to a quick start, leading 7-1 after the first quarter, and systematically built up a 12-point differential en route to a resounding win to open conference play.
But credit the win to the upperclassmen and newcomers alike.
Although junior two-meter Matt Burton finished with a team-high four scores, freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie was equally as impressive, recording the first hat trick of his career.
“Burton played a great game,” Vavic said. “I think he really showed great leadership.”
Although USC flexed its offensive muscles Saturday, it was its tenacity and defense that shined through on Sunday.
Trailing 5-4 against LMU with 1:25 left in the first half, the Lions, not the Trojans, were the aggressors; and subsequently, USC found itself quickly in a hole.
But with just seconds remaining before halftime, junior driver Peter Kurzeka took advantage of a 6-on-5 opportunity, scoring a goal that would even the score at the break.
And then a strange thing happened:  The Trojans outscored a highly potent LMU offense 5-0 in the second half following hat tricks from Kurzeka and Davie. Even with their string of six straight goals, however, it was the defensive unit, anchored by junior goalie Joel Dennerley, that guided the Trojans to their fourth win of the season.
“The defense was great,” Vavic said. “Joel did a very good job. We especially did a great job in the second half against LMU and did not allow any goals. That was fantastic.”
One weekend doesn’t make a season, but with the NorCal Tournament scheduled for next weekend, it already looks as if this young group is beginning to hit its stride.
“It was not an easy weekend, but it was a great situation,” Vavic said. “It’s going to give us confidence that we can come from behind, and showed we also have good depth as well. It’s very encouraging.”

The set-up: After a strong offensive showing but weak defensive performance in Hawaii, the USC football team came into its home opener looking to put together a solid effort on both sides of the football and hand Virginia a convincing loss.
Jubilation · Junior wide receiver Brandon Carswell celebrates with his teammates after scoring the Trojans’ second touchdown of the game. The pass came just minutes after USC’s first score in the first half. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The story: It was one step forward, two steps back for the Trojans (2-0) in coach Lane Kiffin’s home debut. The offense managed just 17 points — 14 of them coming in the last four minutes of the first half — after putting up 49 the previous week in Hawaii. Also, for the second game in a row, the Trojan offense was outgained by its opponent, as USC put up 329 yards of total offense compared to 340 from Virginia.
This offensive performance was a far cry from the last time Kiffin stood on the USC sideline, with the likes of Matt Leinart, Dwayne Jarrett and Reggie Bush on the field.
“I would’ve loved it to be like the old days, even at the half, as [Virginia] was hanging around [I would’ve loved] to come out and blow it up like it would’ve been like the old days,” Kiffin said.
The offense wasn’t the only area of concern for the Trojans. USC was also very undisciplined. The Trojans committed 13 penalties for 140 yards, many of them coming at crucial points in the game.
There was the holding penalty on a fourth down, early in the second quarter — after Virginia gave the Trojans a second chance with a running into the kicker penalty — that erased a completed pass for a first down. Then, on the next USC drive, there was another holding penalty that nullified the 47-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, keeping the game scoreless.
That’s not to mention the two 15-yard personal foul penalties — the horse-collar tackle by redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton and the late hit out of bounds by sophomore safety T.J. McDonald — on back-to-back plays late in the fourth quarter, right after senior kicker Joe Houston’s field goal gave USC a 17-7 lead.
“Really disappointed in the penalties once again,” Kiffin said. “We got to find a way to stop them. They were critical ones too. It’s one thing to get holding penalties when your pass is incomplete and they decline it or something but when you get penalties on a 50-yard touchdown pass and fourth-down conversion those are big-time penalties that could possibly cost us 14 points between the two of them.”
Defensive improvement: The defense showed significant improvement, giving up just 14 points and 340 yards after giving up 36 points and 588 yards against Hawai’i. There were still missed tackles throughout the game, but the unit did a good job bending and not breaking.
“At USC we have a tradition of playing great defense and any time you hear people say they have to doubt a USC defense, I can’t lie and say it hasn’t hurt our pride,” McDonald said. “We came into this game with a chip on our shoulder and we stressed the whole week that we were going to finish our plays and tackle. I thought we did that pretty well but there’s still stuff to work on.”
Welcome Dillon Baxter: Freshman tailback sensation Dillon Baxter got his first carry as a Trojan for no gain with 2:23 left in the first quarter. Baxter was used periodically throughout the game, finishing with nine carries for 49 yards, which was three times as many carries as  senior tailback Allen Bradford.
“I was a little nervous, but not as nervous as I expected,” Baxter said. “It felt just like practice. Our defense has been doing alright and giving us good looks every week. Once things got going it just felt kind of like practice and I just followed everything Coach told me.”
In somewhat of a surprising move, Baxter was the feature back on the key drive for the Trojans that put them up 10 points in the fourth quarter. Baxter had three carries for 18 yards to set up Houston’s 34-yard field goal in what turned out to be the game-winning score.
“At halftime coach Kiff said he would need me a little more than the first half, so I was expecting it a little more but not all that much,” Baxter said.
Houston, we have liftoff: Houston recorded the first made field goal of his USC career with a 34-yard kick with 5:52 left in the game.
Houston barely missed a 47-yard attempt wide right earlier in the game — his first career attempt — but knew his number would be called again.
“I had this feeling that I was going to have to come back and make a kick and that’s why I have a helmet and jersey in the locker room. I was just doing my job,” Houston said. “I was just thinking about making the kick. Honestly, in that part of the game you never know what’s going to happen. Kicks in the fourth quarter are important; the team’s really counting on you there and you got to come through.”
Wouldn’t this be game 2 rewind???

After consecutive road trips the last two weekends, the Women of Troy seemed to be right at home at McAllister Field, knocking off two opponents Friday and Sunday in the Trojan Invitational.
Leg up · Sophomore forward Samantha Johnson contributed a goal to the Women of Troy’s 3-1 victory over Northern Arizona on Sunday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Facing another ranked opponent in No. 25 Auburn (4-2-0), the Women of Troy (3-1-2) held the home crowd in suspense, waiting until overtime to strike. During the first minute of the extra period, freshman midfielder Haley Boysen knocked in her first collegiate goal to give the team the victory.
“I think our team did a great job connecting and bringing what we’ve been working on in practice to this game,” Boysen said. “I think we should have finished our chances, but I think we did a great job overall.”
Though the Women of Troy had countless opportunities to score in regulation, they just couldn’t find the back of the net.
“I’m pleased we created the opportunities, but we need to finish the opportunities we create,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “But the team is growing, the team is improving and our depth is improving so it’s good to get a result.”
Not to be overshadowed by Boysen’s heroics, the defense held the Tigers scoreless, posting its third consecutive shutout.
“Our backline has been defending like their lives have depended on it,” Khosroshahin said. “They’re gaining confidence, they’re giving the team confidence and they’re giving the goalkeeper confidence. Right now, they’re the backbone of our team and they’re going to stay that way for us.”
In the second game of the tournament, the Women of Troy (4-1-2) proved to be too much for Northern Arizona (1-3-2), coming away with a 3-1 victory.
Not only did they create plenty of opportunities, but this time, they finished the job.
“We were decent, we took care of the ball well at times, but we scored multiple goals for the first time this year, so we’ll take it,” Khosroshahin said.
In the 23rd minute of the first half, sophomore forward Samantha Johnson checked in and immediately made her presence known.
Sophomore forward Courtney Garcia placed a through-ball to freshman midfielder Haley Boysen, who crossed it to the far right goal post and Johnson finished off the play with a header that found the back of the net.
In the second half, junior forward/defender Ashley Freyer scored off a corner kick in the 53rd minute, giving the Women of Troy a two-goal cushion.
But Northern Arizona would strike back in the 63rd minute, as junior forward Jenna Samora scored to cut the lead in half.
In the 82nd minute, freshman Mia Bruno put the game out of reach, placing the ball from outside the box into the back of the net and capping off the scoring for the Women of Troy.
“We did well as a team and we connected well with each other,” Bruno said. “We were patient in front of the net and we finished our opportunities so that was good.”
Though the defense allowed a goal for the first time in four games, freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church believes the team has still played well shutting down its opponents.
“We’ve definitely held our own and defense wins games most of the time,” Church said. But it’s not just the backline, it’s the whole team playing defense.”
After capping off a perfect weekend, Khosroshahin said he is pleased with the team’s effort, but still believes they can get better.
“We’re just barely starting to mesh, but hopefully we can continue to improve,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve seen our best game. We still have a lot of areas that we need to get better at, but the good thing with this group is that they’re committed to it.”

As sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley got up to leave his seat at the press conference after USC’s closer-than-you’d-like 17-14 win over Virginia Saturday night, he muttered in a hushed voice, almost out of range of the microphone, “A win is a win.”
The tone of the statement coming out of the young leader’s mouth appeared to be a mixture of determination, exhaustion and, most of all, frustration.
But not the type of frustration you’d expect after a troubled three-point victory over a perennial ACC bottom feeder. This frustration seemed to come from the feeling that no one understood how hard it has been for this team, which was essentially broken down and rearranged during the offseason, to continue to play at an elite level and still come away with a 2-0 record.
It is understandable that USC fans expect the best from their team. After all, the Trojans have won 11 games or more and a Pac-10 title in seven of the last eight seasons; even last year, the one time when the team failed to achieve both those benchmarks, it still posted nine victories and an Emerald Bowl win.
But it’s time to wake up. Pete Carroll is off somewhere in Seattle, and the 2000s are over. USC still has great talent, great coaching and great fans, but this is an entirely different show, and there is still a lot of growing to do for the Trojans before they really deserve the expectations that are automatically placed on them with the start of every season.
The Virginia game marked only the 35th time that USC coach Lane Kiffin has been at the helm of a team — unheard of for a head coach at an upper-tier college program — and he is coaching a unit that put 10 sophomores and freshmen out on the field in starting offensive and defensive roles against the Cavaliers. No matter how good those players are, nothing can take the place of in-game experience, and there is going to be a significant learning curve as they try to become accustomed to collegiate-level football.
Even some of the starting upperclassmen — redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler, redshirt junior tight end Rhett Ellison and junior tackle Armond Armstead, to name a few — have only started a handful of games in their careers, as they have dealt with lingering injuries or a loaded depth chart that prevented them from rising to the top spot.
The inexperience is evident. You can see it in the missed assignments, the overthrown passes and the miscommunication at the line. And even if you’ve missed those instances, the blizzard of yellow flags should be a dead giveaway — USC has already racked up 24 penalties for 240 yards in two games, astronomical numbers for a college team.
To make matters worse, the pushover opponents that so many expected to face in the first couple of games (myself included — see my last column) never really showed up. In their place were two smart, well-run programs that weren’t afraid to go toe-to-toe with a nationally ranked opponent.
They have faced the best passing offense in the nation in Hawai’i, who, even after having both its first- and second-string quarterbacks knocked out of the game by USC defenders, continued to put up yards and points through the air.
They have faced a solid Virginia defense that ranks near the top in fewest points and yards allowed thus far, which put its foot down on the Trojan running game and held some of the most dynamic backs in the country to 147 combined yards on 33 attempts.
But they are 2-0. They have found a way to win, even if it hasn’t been in typical USC fashion.
Call me soft or naïve, but this team has faced more obstacles in the last nine months than any other team in the nation and it remains undefeated.
And they haven’t shown any signs of letting up. The players have made it clear that they see the challenge ahead of them. If Kiffin’s post-game interviews are any indication, the Trojans will be out at practice today working harder than they have all season to be as prepared as possible for next week.
For that, they should be commended.
And for that, those of us in Trojan nation should take a deep breath, relax and remember: For now, a win is a win.

It was slow. It was muddled. It was frustrating.
But it was a win.
Taking off · Freshman tailback Dillon Baxter made his USC debut Saturday night, rushing for 49 yards on nine carries. He backed up junior tailback Marc Tyler and helped to complement a passing game led by sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The USC football team (2-0) came out on top Saturday night with a 17-14 victory over Virginia (1-1), despite failing to establish much consistency throughout the course of the game. The Trojans were outgained in yards and repeatedly hurt themselves with penalties on both sides of the ball, but mustered just enough offensive firepower to put the Cavaliers away.
“[I am] really disappointed in our performance,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin after the game. “They outcoached us. We just had better players and made some plays. I hope you can tell the disappointment in our team and coaching staff. We’re not getting it done.”
Although last week’s game in Hawaii featured a plethora of scoring and a noticeable lack of defense, Saturday’s matchup turned the tables; defense controlled the pace of play, as neither team was able to get on the scoreboard until just less than four minutes were left on the clock in the second quarter.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley was able to complete 20 of 35 passing attempts for 202 yards, but a lackluster running game stalled the Trojan attack, as redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler was only able to manage 67 yards on 18 rush attempts. Freshman tailback Dillon Baxter’s debut as a Trojan was promising, as the rookie gained 49 yards on just nine attempts, but USC’s rushing corps could not break out of a sluggish start to contribute a score.
“[Running the ball] felt really crowded, like there were bodies everywhere,” Tyler said. “Their defensive line was doing a lot better.”
After a fit of scoring at the end of the half that featured three touchdowns — two by the Trojans to senior tight end Jordan Cameron and redshirt junior wide receiver Brandon Carswell with a Virginia score sandwiched in between — the offensive lull returned in the third quarter as the sides traded possessions with little to show until senior kicker Joe Houston’s field goal late in the fourth quarter put the Trojans up 17-7. A score by the Cavaliers with four seconds left in the game cut the differential to three, but USC was able to fall on an onside kick and run out the clock to seal the victory.
Despite the victory and a perfect start to the season, the mood in the USC locker room remained dampened.
“It’s probably the most miserable 2-0 locker room I’ve ever been in,” Kiffin said. “But that’s good, because it means the players understand our expectations and what we want from them.”
Penalties remained a major area of concern for the Trojans, as they were flagged 13 times for 140 yards. A 47-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson was negated by a holding call, as was a fourth-and-two conversion early in the second half.
“Penalties killed us,” Barkley said. “A lot of crucial plays were called back because of penalties. Our game plan was fine; we were rolling, but we weren’t executing and moving the ball, especially on third down. I definitely think that hurt us. We just need to become more disciplined.”
If there was one positive USC can take from Saturday’s game, it is in the substantial defensive improvement the team made since last week. The Trojans repeatedly stopped the Virginia attack in key situations, including on two red zone trips that could have swung the game in Virginia’s favor. In one instance, with the Cavaliers looming on USC’s four-yard line, sophomore safety T.J. McDonald intercepted a Marc Verica pass in the end zone to return possession to the Trojans and keep the game knotted at 0-0.
“We came into this game with a chip on our shoulder and we stressed the whole week that we were going to finish our plays and tackle. I thought we did that pretty well but there’s still stuff to work on,” McDonald said. “It comes down to preparation. I’m happy with the win and with the way our defense played, but at the same time, you can never be satisfied.”
The Trojans will now have another week to prepare for their last non-conference game at Minnesota and to work on the problems they have identified thus far.
“We need to go back to work, get in the film room [Sunday] and back to the field on Tuesday,” Kiffin said. “We need to improve before we lose a game like this because we play so poorly.”

The USC School of Social Work, in conjunction with the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families, has begun using a $7.6 million four-year grant it received in July.
The school will send 30 Master of Social Work interns to eight local school districts to work with military families and discover ways to address the issues related to deployed parents.
“The kids [at the schools] run into all sorts of trouble in regards to graduating on time. It creates such a negative feeling,” USC professor of social work Ron Astor said.
These USC students will primarily work with school districts near military bases where more than 10,000 students — or 10 percent of the school population — are from military families.
The four-year project intends to help the 149 public schools in the USC area become more supportive environments for children whose parents typically have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.
“First thing we’re working on is the data on what is the issue that the kids are reporting as the biggest issue in their school,” Astor said.
All of the funding going toward this project comes from a grant from the Department of Defense Education Activity.
Astor, the principal investigator, will work with co-principal investigators Anthony Hassan, director of CIR, Marleen Wong, clinical professor of social work, and Rami Benbenishty, a professor at Bar Ilan University in Tel Aviv, Israel.
Although only 30 students are currently involved, organizers anticipate increasing the number next year and partnering with San Diego State University and UC San Diego to reach more schools in the future.
Districts around San Diego have one of the highest percentages of students from military families.
According to Astor, the students have typically gone to “nine to 10 schools” throughout their K-12 education, which can create social and academic issues. At times teachers can be unaware of the causes of these problems and make things harder on the child.
“When children go to civilian schools, outside of the post, camp, there seems to be a lack of awareness of the school systems to meet the needs of these children,” Hassan said.

As the momentum of an exciting presidential campaign has died down and the government works to get the country back on track, experts say more and more young people are turning an eye to the conservative side of politics.
Or, at least that’s the trend nationally. Only 54 percent of 18- to 28-year-old voters identify themselves as Democrats, compared to 62 percent in 2008 during the presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center.
Locally, however, the state still remains mostly liberal according to Sherry Jeffe, a political analyst for KNBC and senior fellow at the USC School of Policy, Planning, and Development.
“Young people are becoming more ‘decline to state,’ if anything,” Jeffe said. “They’re independent, swing voters. They’re not affiliating with either of the two major parties.”
Micah Scheindlin, political director of USC’s College Democrats, said he doesn’t see a declining number of Democratic voters is an issue on USC’s campus.
“I don’t buy that theory,” Scheindlin said. “New voters are registering Republican less and less.”
Katherine Cook, chairwoman of the USC College Republicans, also said there doesn’t seem to be any increase in Republican sentiment.
“I have found that students are particularly passionate about social issues — abortion, gender issues, gay rights and similar topics,” Cook said. “In those areas I find students come down on the liberal side of the issue, and I don’t think that has changed since 2008.”
Even so, Cook said that economic issues are weighing heavily on students’ minds, which could mean a more conservative outlook overall.
“With the current economic recession affecting the job market, students may feel it is in their best interest to vote for candidates who are more fiscally conservative,” Cook said. “Republican candidates are offering viable solutions to improve the economic crisis, and Americans — students included — are responding positively to that.”
Voter focus on candidates rather than a political party, on the other hand, does seem to be a trend that’s going strong in California.
“I think [students] are just disgusted with both of the major parties,” Jeffe said. “[Students] are more candidate-centered. You saw that in 2008 when Barack Obama had such a significant turnout of voters and now they seem to be less loyal to him, less satisfied with what he’s done among the groups.”
No matter what political party young people affiliate with, the economy continues to be the No. 1 issue on their minds, Scheindlin said.
“People’s concerns are equally severe now,” he said. “We’ve yet to see which party they’ll blame.”
Still, Cook said she has seen more student interest in College Republicans this year than in years past.
“We were extremely well-received at the Involvement Fair,” she said. “We added a remarkable number of students to our database.”
Maybe there’s hope for this world yet!

The Salvatori Computer Science Center, a study spot for engineering students, now provides newer computer technology and improved study spaces for students after the university and Information Technology Services upgraded the computer lab this summer.
Lab time · Lillian Lin, a sophomore majoring in architecture, works at the Salvatori lab Sunday. The lab is open 24 hours, Monday through Thursday. - Daniel Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
The center was renovated as part of a larger initiative funded by the Office of the Provost to improve existing resources on campus and increase USC’s capacity for more advanced forms of technology.
The renovation focused on several key themes — mobility, collaboration and better interaction — to improve the lab. The center is now equipped with spaces for students to use their own laptops and provides group study rooms, modeled after the spaces in Leavey Library.
A new laptop rental program offers 90 computers for students to check out for four-hour periods, which can be renewed if more time is needed. For student convenience, the laptops may be taken anywhere on campus, said Joseph Cevetello, director of ITS Learning Environments.
“The initiative really involved taking a look at all the learning centers on campus with an eye toward renovating them and bringing them [more closely] to what students need,” Cevetello said.
He explained that the space had been completely transformed to fit growing demands from both students and the university for a more high-tech experience throughout campus.
In addition, ITS installed collaborative software, including TeamSpot, a cross-platform program that enables wireless sharing of screens between computers, to encourage a more interactive environment and to build upon peer learning opportunities.
In response to student feedback about the difficulties of printing from laptops, the space now has wireless printing capabilities. Costs were reduced as well, Cevetello said; it is now the cheapest place to print on campus and charges 10 cents per page for black and white printing, compared to 12 cents per page at Leavey Library.
“It was about recognizing that [some of] our learning spaces had not been updated in more than 20 years,” Cevetello added.
Many engineers have had positive reactions to the changes, acknowledging that the center seems more aesthetically pleasing, and that the improved software is helpful, most notably the addition of Macs that run Windows programs.
“It looks really nice; the new computers are much better,” said Edward Gonzales, a graduate student studying electrical engineering.
Despite student satisfaction and support from USC’s Undergraduate Student Government, some students said glitches will need to be worked out to prevent overcrowding.
“I’m less likely to rent a laptop than I am to just get a desk computer,” said Gonzales, who, like many engineering students, prefers large screens rather than small screens on laptops when working with graphics.
The lab hours have not changed; it is open 24 hours a day Monday through Thursday, midnight to 11 p.m. on Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturday, and 7:30 a.m. to midnight on Sunday.
“As an engineer, you pretty much live 24 hours in SAL,” said Elizabeth Windler, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. Fortunately for engineers, Cevetello said there are plans to expand the hours so that the lab would be open 24 hours a day, seven days per week.
“It was very forward thinking,” said Yaniv Tal, a senior majoring in electrical engineering. “The hours thing is huge … as engineers, we have to work late.”

Five USC schools and prominent members of the health community attended the eighth-annual obesity summit Friday at Town and Gown, where speakers and workshops focused on the growing problem of childhood obesity.
Eating right · Chef Robert Edwards gives a healthy cooking demonstration to Congresswoman Grace Napolitano at the childhood obesity summit Friday. The summit focused on research and creating policies to solve the issue of childhood weight problems. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Part of the first National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, the summit attempted to lay the groundwork for future policies, and focused on mapping out the issue and discussing solutions.
“Obesity is not just a problem for the child who gets picked on at school or doesn’t get picked on the playground,” USC President C.L. Max Nikias said. “There is a cost for all of us.”
Nikias opened the summit by thanking various officials who came from different parts of the country.
“I am convinced that together we can make sure the childhood obesity crisis of today is only a memory tomorrow,” Nikias said. “I feel privileged to be holding this literal ‘meeting of the minds’ here on campus.”
The nearly 350 people in attendance, including six congressional members, was more than expected, according to administrators who organized the event.
“It was a pretty amazing production, not only from standpoint of how it was done but by the attendance,” said Eddie North-Hager, a representative from USC Media Relations.
When the Congressional Hispanic, Black and Asian Pacific American Caucuses, or tri-caucus, asked USC to host the event, North-Hager said the university jumped at the chance.
Jennifer Grodksy, executive director of the USC Office of Federal Relations, said she believes the university was asked because of its place in the community.
“We are known as a leader in healthcare, and because of our location … We’re a target population and because of all our civic engagement,” she said.
The event also featured healthy cooking demonstrations with chefs and touched upon the need for future obesity research.
“Twenty-six percent of Americans are obese and we have no good data on type 2 diabetes,” said Dr. Kenneth Moritsugu of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Institute.
The summit, however, is not the first effort by USC to temper  the increase of childhood obesity.
Innovative projects are sprouting in an attempt to tackle the issue. A program called KNOWME, through the Viterbi School of Engineering, uses a mobile device to track a child’s activity level, sending text messages to a participant’s phone about his obesity-related behavior.
“While we have many experts focusing on this problem, we cannot solve it alone. All of us must work together. We must combine our efforts. We must pool our resources,” Nikias said. 
An empowerment camp called Minority Youth Leaders in Action was held at USC in August. Led by USC’s Rossier School of Education, it encouraged teenagers at risk for obesity to increase their healthy options.
“I think they’re trying to translate hard science into intervention that would work in the community,” said Janet Schneiderman, an assistant professor of social work. “This is the epicenter of obesity in L.A., South Central, so we have a very good possibility of making a difference in this particular community.” 
Keynote speaker Audrey Howe pointed out that hunger and obesity are two sides to the same coin. 
“They are both fueled by a lack of nutrition,” Howe said.
The consequences of obesity range from diabetes to asthma to emotional disorders such as depression, anxiety and a lower self-esteem, Nikias said.
One in every three American children are overweight or obese, and particular ethnic groups and regions are more severely impacted, according to White House reports.
“It doesn’t take a crystal ball to see that this problem will get worse unless we do something to make it better,” Nikias said.

When I was deciding which college to attend, I looked for three specific things: good academic programs, good weather and good bakeries. USC meets the first two criteria. The third one proved more of a challenge.
Take a bite ·  Expand your pastry diet with a Sarah Bernhardt, a small cookie with chocolate mousse and dark chocolate ganache. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
Carbs are my weakness, but even a carbaholic has her limit. In a crazed frenzy, I stumbled around the USC campus and found nothing but fluffy, anorexic bagels and naked cupcakes disguised as muffins.
Yes, Los Angeles has its share of famous bakeries, such as Sprinkles  Cupcakes and La Brea Bakery. But as a freshman without a car, and neither time nor the budget to stand in line for hours to buy a $3.50 cupcake, I felt doomed to a soulless existence without my daily carbfest.
That all changed when I jettisoned my preconceived notion of what constitutes a good bakery and opened my mind (and stomach) to ethnic bakeries — tasty, hidden gems in close proximity to the USC campus.
Los Angeles might never be known for dense, chewy bagels, but it is known for its ethnic diversity. And every ethnic community has its own source for unique breads and pastries.
Superior Grocers at the University Village
You might be surprised, but Superior has an excellent bakery. Its frequently bruised produce might leave much to be desired, but its baked goods are always fresh, delicious and super, super cheap. Where else can you get a cream cheese muffin bigger than your fist for just 60 cents?
Its more familiar items, such as brownies, chocolate chip cookies and pound cakes, are all tasty and just as good as gourmet bakeries in Beverly Hills; but venture from the norm and try its Mexican pastries. What have you got to lose? None of the pastries cost more than a dollar.
In fact, conchas, a traditional Mexican bread, are just 25 cents each. They are round, fluffy rolls with a sugary, shortbread-like cookie crust that come in white, yellow, pink or brown. The white and yellow conchas have subtle vanilla tones, the pink a touch of strawberry and the brown a light chocolate flavor. The bottom roll is rich and soft, while the topping is sweet and crumbly, an altogether pleasant contrast. It makes the most “balanced” breakfast: rich yet light, with only a smattering of sweetness to satisfy the morning sweet tooth.
For sweeter pick-me-ups, try Superior’s  sweet empanadas, a buttery pastry wrapped around different fruit fillings. Its capirotada, a Mexican bread pudding, is also a rich sticky delight, studded with raisins and punched with different spices. And you can never go wrong with its churros, deep-fried dough piped into a long, thin cylinder with a ridged surface crusted with cinnamon and sugar.
If you prefer more savory breads, get its bolillo, a salty sub that is reminiscent of French bread with its thick crust and soft insides. It gets a high turnout; I always see customers lining up with eight to 10 of these oval rolls, so you can be guaranteed that they are always baked fresh daily.
Tous Les Jours at Olympic Boulevard, Koreatown
As a Korean, I was thrilled to discover this famous Korean bakery chain just a 10-minute metro bus ride away from campus.
Tours Les Jours means “every day” in French, and its whole concept is based around an image of a mother cycling back home with a basket full of freshly baked goods. This concept might not apply to you, however, as you’re more likely to have nibbled whatever you bought on the way back home.
You will find deceptively French-looking items as you walk in. But on a closer look, you’ll discover that most items have an Asian twist, and at the same time sense a definite sweet potato and red bean fetish.
Embrace the fetish.
There is a reason why Asians love to inject these flavors into anything — the natural sugars in sweet potatoes infuse the baked good with an intense, caramelized sweetness that you cannot get from regular sugar. The red bean-paste that is stuffed into doughnuts, croissants and buns provides a smooth, slightly salty contrast, cutting the richness of the dough.
Its baguettes will never beat those of Paris, and its doughnuts will never surpass those sold at Dunkin’ Donuts, but it’s the unique interpretations of these traditional baked goods that will keep you coming back for more.
Treat yourself to its walnut cream baguette — an earthy, walnut-studded, half-sliced loaf filled with pillowy whipped cream between each crevice. Or sink your teeth into its sweet rice doughnut, a chewy, glutinous ball with — what else? — a red bean-paste filling.
Feeling a bit more adventurous? Tease your sweet and savory palate with the tuna croquette or sweet corn cream doughnut. You might wrinkle your nose right now, but one bite and I promise it’ll all make sense.
Hygge Bakery at 11th and Hope streets, Downtown
You know those Danish pastries you’ve been choking down for years with your morning coffee? Hygge Bakery snorts at them for being as Danish as French fries are French.
Hygge Bakery, located just a few minutes’ walk from L.A. Live, claims to be the first fully authentic Danish bakery in Los Angeles — and possibly in all of the United States. That is hefty bragging, but Hygge Bakery manages to deliver.
Forget cream cheese Danishes; the Danish never puts cream cheese into their pastries, and certainly not the shiny fruit-flavored jelly. Instead, think sweet, fragrant marzipan, creamy custard and chocolate.
This place will change your concept of pastries forever. Gone are the images of dense, doughy croissants. Real Danish pastries are delicate works of art — light, flaky puffs of delicate, buttery layers. Each spandauer (circular pastries with a marzipan or custard center) is composed of 27 feather-light layers.
Don’t go counting them though; instead, spend your time just relishing the airy flakes of dough melting on your tongue. Another favorite is the kringle bar, a slab of puff pastry slathered with marzipan and a buttercream called remonce, topped with crunchy almond slices.
If you love cinnamon rolls, you’ll go ga-ga over this version of a cinnamon roll, which is mostly buttery cinnamon filling with less dough. Each pastry, ranging from $1.95 to $2.25, is not exactly cheap, but for the quality you get, the price is reasonable.
Or splurge and spend a dollar more on the fancy petite cakes, such as the Sarah Bernhardt, which consists of a luscious chocolate mousse set on top of a thin crispy cookie and covered with dark chocolate ganache. You cannot go wrong with good quality chocolate covered with more chocolate.
“Good” is such an ambiguous term with bakeries. You can get a good bagel at a bagel store in Brooklyn, but you’re unlikely to find good croissants at the same store.
Thus, leave the bagels to New Yorkers and the sourdough bread to San Franciscans. Embrace what Los Angeles has to offer: an ethnic mosaic of individual cultures and traditions, preferably while carb-feasting at its authentic ethnic bakeries.

With two weeks in the books of the college football season, the depth of the Pac-10 is apparent.
Considering both the AP and USA Today polls, there are six Pac-10 teams can be found in the rankings.
USC (2-0) dropped two spots to No. 18 in the AP poll — the only poll the Trojans are eligible forbecause of the NCAA sanctions — after the narrow 17-14 win over Virginia Saturday.
Following two dominant offensive performances — including a 48-13 victory at Tennessee on Saturday — the Oregon Ducks (2-0) are the highest-ranked team in the conference, coming in at No. 5 in the AP and No. 6 in the USA Today rankings.
No. 19 Stanford (2-0, 1-0) — opening conference play with a 35-0 route of UCLA (0-2, 0-1) — No. 24 Arizona (2-0) and No. 25 Oregon State (0-1) are all ranked in the AP poll.
Arizona, Stanford and Cal (2-0) are positioned at No. 18, No. 19, and No. 24 respectively in the USA Today poll.
Utah (2-0, 1-0) — who will join the Pac-10 in 2011 — is ranked No. 14 in both polls.
This weekend the conference teams will be play several highly regarded opponents with match-ups like No. 9 Iowa (2-0) at Arizona, Arizona State at No. 11 Wisconsin (2-0) and No. 8 Nebraska (2-0) at Washington (1-1). With this tough slate, these Pac-10 teams have good opportunities to solidify their rankings before conference play swings into full gear.

For those of you in Annenberg, see if this exchange sounds familiar:
“What’s your major?”
“Print journalism.”
“Oh. OK. Nice.”
Pause.
Students from the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism might be well-versed in bracing themselves for the unspoken question hidden within the hesitation: “So what can you do with that major?” People often snidely or concernedly remark that print journalism will be old news by the time the newest batch of Annenberg students graduate.
The question at the tip of many tongues, from harried journalists fearful for their jobs to aspiring reporters and the common reader, was what would happen to the future of journalism. But now, the final death knell appears to have tolled for print journalism. The New York Times, one of the bastions of journalism, conceded the inevitability of an eventual termination of the print version of its publication.
At the International Newsroom Summit in London on Sept. 8, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher and chairman of The New York Times, cautioned that the Gray Lady could no longer be available in print.
“We will stop printing The New York Times sometime in the future, date TBD,” Sulzberger said.
In case you missed the collective gasp from reporters around the country and editors jumping to public relations, don’t worry. You didn’t. Analysts have been composing eulogies for print newspapers since before the Kindle’s first release in 2007 and the ensuing squabble over e-reader dominance. The New York Times shed 7.3 percent of its print circulation from 2008-2009 alone.
Pick up a copy of the Los Angeles Times and you might notice it slowly becoming more threadbare. At times it seems flimsy little packets of papers lie where hefty behemoths of reporting once did at doorsteps across the city.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Though physical newspapers might soon be doomed to the fate of sheepskin scrolls, journalism itself survives as a highly marketable, in-demand commodity. In fact, according to the Newspaper Association of America, a 6.7 percent increase in  daily newspaper readership — be it online or print — occurred between 2000 and 2007, even as dead-tree edition circulation declined by 25.6 percent since 2000.
The public has not entirely abandoned reputable news: It has merely gravitated toward the wealth of reporting on the Web, whether on the blogs of private individuals or from aggregators such as Yahoo! or CNN. Hyperlocal reporting has also picked up in popularity, detailing neighborhood events in a manner much like college newspapers. The issue, however, is that Internet audiences would rather trust faceless bloggers than time-tested, venerable news sources — as long as the content is free.
But which sites do bloggers and online news portals link to when referencing a source or passing the baton of breaking news alerts? The Atlantic, Yahoo News, CNN, Time magazine — or, more often than not, The New York Times.
Journalism has entered a transitional phase. Annenberg has acknowledged that, and stepped up to meet the industry revolution. Since this fall semester, Annenberg has rechristened its bachelor of arts degree in print journalism — print and digital journalism — reflecting the steady exodus to online reporting.
In our Google Generation, the nostalgia for the Sunday paper over a cup of coffee, scrambled eggs and toast has never quite applied to us, so the cultural shift to digital media is all but complete; we just require a workable business model overhaul of current corporate structures.
The New York Times revealed plans for a new metered-model paywall — which means that only the heaviest users are charged — for its website to be unveiled sometime in early 2011, joining other publications such as The Economist in charging for content. USA Today underwent an extensive internal reshuffling to “focus less on print … and more on producing content for all platforms” according to The Associated Press. Indeed, e-media platforms, such as the Kindle, iPad and other mobile technology might very well be one of the saving graces of journalism. But if any of you business students want in on the action, go right ahead.
As with every revolution, new opportunities always emerge phoenix-like from the debris. Online journalism allows real-time interaction with readers and a connectivity only wistfully longed for before. Imagine yourself blogging live from Afghanistan, the White House press room or the high-flying excitement of a Lakers game. Although we might be leaving behind the inky papers of print newspapers, journalism will still remain invaluable.
Annenberg print and digital journalism majors: We look forward to reading your high-quality reporting online in the coming years.

To continue with my earlier comment (thanks for the opportunity, btw!): If we’re going to use market incentives to revive journalism, we need to express what that market is. I contend that the market is beautifully reflexive because the market is YOU. You send your money (taxes) to various government entities that act as representations of you. That money comes back to you in the form of “policy”.
———-
If we control the distribution or disbursement of taxes — if we control policy — through a dependency on the quality of a community’s civic responsibility, we create incentives for that community to be well-equipped with accurate and reliable information. Determining that quality implies an accountability, responsiveness, and fungibility that arguably hasn’t been possible before this century. This is where we find the “new business”. Technology’s imposition of what we currently call “transparency” is essential. And the new business will bring forth the new traditions of profiting from not-for-profits, profiting from low-profit LLCs, and gains from open-source products. Have a look at datasf.org for a hint.
Nice of you to mention business students, because there are obscured opportunities for business and growth despite the apparent death rattle of print. The opportunities are gathered around the idea that journalism-as-a-public-good is dying as well (or maybe we’re already at the wake), and that market incentives can be used to revive it.
——–
You see, it’s expensive to maintain foreign bureaus. Heck, it  can cost quite a bit just to send a reporter to the next county over. And you can imagine what the bean counters mutter when the editors speak of conducting an 18-month investigation before publishing a story. Revenue from digital advertising and “paywalls” cannot sustain journalism as a public good.
———
I’ll revise that a little bit…revenue levels that sustain journalism as a public good won’t be achieved unless the content helps “us” make money. This is why the Wall Street Journal succeeds at collecting long-term, online subscriptions. Its content helps its subscribers make more money than is expended for the subscription. Spotty success will come with the “yellow journalism” that appeals to our prurient interest. But continual reports about which celebrities are in rehab, or auto-tuning Mel Gibson’s emotional hi-jackings have limited value, in my opinion. Hope that’s not too much of an understatement for you.
_____
Currently there is no value that can be assigned to journaled content as a public good; there is no quid pro quo. The perceived value is intangible in that it merely fulfills the individual’s desire for civic responsibility. So when we start assigning a real value to the information we can acquire, we will see journalism flourish. This means establishing market incentives for accurate and reliable information. That is an alarming proposition that presents many risks.

California legislators might be singing the body electric right now, but in Los Angeles, it’s all about bikes. Actually, it’s all about cars, freeways and, to a lesser extent, the Kardashians. But as the state is warming to the idea of congratulating plug-in cars with carpool lane access, the City of Angels is inching slowly toward being a biker’s city.
William Brown | Daily Trojan
At this summer’s L.A. Bicycle Summit, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa outlined a plan to build 1,600 miles of bike paths around Los Angeles and suggested laws requiring cars to give cyclists a three-foot berth when passing on the road. All in all, Angeleno cyclists have much to look forward to in the coming years.
Trojans have no such luck.
By now, the campus bicycle/pedestrian schism is a tired enough subject to have exhausted all puns (the last time I wrote about the issue I mentioned “spinning the wheel,” and even that was admittedly a stretch). But just because we can’t be clever doesn’t mean we should stop writing about campus security’s contentious relationship with bikers (we can include skateboarders in this too, but they’re really more a danger to themselves.)
This time last year, the Department of Public Safety’s attack plan for cyclists was slipshod. It involved inviting LAPD officers to monitor intersections a few times a semester to ticket riders, impounding stray bikes (a plan that proved impossible to carry out with the lack of resources) and telling students to walk their bikes through traffic-heavy areas of campus.
USC was in need of a more comprehensive plan for how to deal with the congestion. We needed more bike racks on the outskirts of campus, we needed bike lanes where there was space and, most of all, we needed consistency.
A year has passed, a pretty, new building has sprouted up in the center of campus and it seems DPS’ tactics have evolved very little. There are simply more officers telling students to walk their bikes. And they’re louder.
As a campus that sees anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 bikes per day, according to a 2009 study conducted by the University Park Health Center, USC needs a bike policy that is definitive and provides for the need of a campus on wheels. Pulling one student over on Trousdale Parkway while a phalanx of beach cruisers glide happily past won’t create a lasting difference in cyclist attitude. It will only teach the student to peddle faster next time.
DPS can’t ignore the fact that people cycle on campus, or concentrate its efforts solely around the prized campus center. It especially can’t allow the bike policy to be confined to a beleaguered officer’s plea to get off and walk.
Funds used to beef up the hall monitor presence in the no-bike zone could instead be allocated to deterring traffic in more productive ways, such as placing more racks on the campus perimeter — which could encourage students to park and walk — and making clearly marked bike paths where possible. Our campus might be too small to accommodate a system of paths, but bike lanes are still possible.
Most of all, the party line should be prevention, not enforcement.
When students are pulled over and told to walk their bikes, their complaint is usually not that they are forced to make the last 100 feet to class on foot. Most mention the crankiness of the officer and the fact that he yelled.
Can we really blame him? This is a problem that has worsened steadily in the past few years, and it’s obvious that our current M.O. isn’t working. “Walk your bike,” has become a hoarse battle cry on campus, and an ineffective one at that.
I’d be cranky too.

Maybe Students should do ride alongs with some of our Maintenance vehicles on and off campus and see just how crazy the students are on their bikes on and off campus. Bike lanes off campus have a direction of flow, not to be ridden against. Yet students always seem to be riding against traffic, causing vehicles to swerve and putting their lives at risk. Is it really worth your life to cut a few minutes off your day. Heres a clue, put down the cell phones while riding your bikes. Stop trying to text while on your bike. Ride in the correct direction of traffic while on your bike. Wake up a few minutes earlier. I work at FMS. We have to share the road with the students and the students need to share it with us. Stop putting your lives at risk. Its not worth it. Maybe the Daily Trojan can mount some dash Cameras on some of our vehicles and record a days actions with these students and play it back for them. It would sure to be an eye opener.
Great points, Rick.  It’s not just about providing adequate solutions for bicyclists, but making sure those bicyclists are being safe.
Glad to see that students at USC understand that the answer to the “bike problem” at USC is to see it as a “bike opportunity” to truly accommodate students, faculty and visitors on bikes with a comprehensive bike path or bike lane system, convenient, adequate bike parking, and bicycle skills education for freshman.
Our non-profit, Sustainable Streets, offers bicycle skills education all over LA, and we’ve contacted USC administration to offer to help set up a comprehensive cycling program at USC…only to be told they want to finish the campus transportation plan before thinking about bike education.
Perhaps less space for cars inside campus is in order? Why are the USC sidewalks so tiny? Why are parking spaces needed in front of dorms deep in the campus? Yes, space is needed for trucks to deliver food and for maintenance vehicles, but that’s not enough traffic to warrant two lanes.
Kick out the cars from campus, and then you can start to talk about limiting bikes as well.
The environmentally conscious arguments about bikes are bunk.  The idea that if bikes were banned from campus, they would be replaced with cars is misleading.  Most bikers around USC are not riding in lieu of driving, they are riding in lieu of walking.  There is no need to have a bike if you live on campus.  Lose the bike and walk.  If you live within a couple blocks of campus – walk.   Wake up a few minutes earlier and walk.  Walk.  Walk.
I went to school at UCSB and the I was horrified to see how the students shelling out double what I paid are treated by the goons at USC when it comes to bike riding. The kids riding bikes are doing us all a massive favor. There is no conceivable way that you can get this many tuition paying students into as dense an area as USC’s campus using anything other than bikes. There need to be quality bike lanes and traffic calming all around the main campus and student housing areas (the university spends ten of millions on car parking – where is the bike parking budget?). Incoming freshmen need to have a basic bike riding skills class made available to them, free of charge. The Campus needs to have bike lanes into the interior, to the largest lecture halls and facilities, and large quantities of bike parking made available. This will help the univeristy’s AQMD Rule 2202 filing (an annual report on how the university is working to reduce auto trips to its facilities). It will also encourage local residents and employees to ride to work – saving money that would otherwise go to subsidized car parking the university provides free of charge to car drivers.
Until adequate, safe space is made for bicycles throughout campus, there are going to be bike/ped conflicts.  The solution is not to force bikes to the periphery of campus, but to make clearly marked room for them on campus.

Los Angeles recently received another nod to its metropolitan persona.
The publication Foreign Policy recently gave Los Angeles the No. 7 spot on its list of the most global cities around the world. To define a global city, the magazine looked at the effects of the cities on the world around them, whether that be through cultural trends or new inventions.
Only a few of the cities on the list were American, and Los Angeles was recognized mostly for Hollywood’s major economic influence on other cities and countries. The magazine calculates that Hollywood grossed a staggering $29.9 billion last year in box-office revenue alone — which, the magazine points out, is about equal to Kenya’s entire GDP.
New York and London took the top two places, respectively.

Los Angeles has been ranked seventh out of 15 major U.S. metropolitan areas for top college cities, based on what major cities have to offer young college students, according to the local blog LAist.
Information used to compile the list isn’t provided by the schools, according to Marla Brill, primary reporter on the College Destinations Index. This, unlike other college rankings, allows the list to be as unbiased as possible, she said.
Out of the 75 college cities listed total, Los Angeles topped most in arts and leisure opportunities, but ranked lower in areas such as city accessibility and cost of living.
Twelve criteria were used in the study, including student concentration, student diversity, research capacity, cost of living, city accessibility, creative class, earning potential and unemployment rate.
The top-ranked city was another California metropolitan: San Francisco.
