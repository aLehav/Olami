The majority of first-year college students in the United States do not have the fundamental skills to be successful in college, according to a recently released ACT report.
The ACT reported that only 25 percent of students in 2011 met all four of the subject area benchmarks. The standardized exam, which has been testing students’ college readiness since 1959, tests high school students’ English, math, science and reading skills.
The ACT defines college readiness as the acquisition of the knowledge a student needs to be successful in their first year of courses in a post-secondary institution.
Quentin Berger, an assistant professor in the department of mathematics at USC who primarily teaches freshman students, said the fundamental skills acquired during high school prove important in collegiate level classes.
“Students must know the basic concepts to move on in higher college level math,” Berger said. “Many of the students I have taught so far this year have needed a refresher in basic concepts.”
Some freshmen said they have also experienced the need to review the fundamentals to succeed in their classes.
“I’m in Thematic Option, and with my writing class, I had to relearn the format and learn the right way to phrase things for an analytical paper,” said Dan Graham, a freshman majoring in international relations.
When looking at first-year students enrolled in a four-year private institution, the percentage of students who have attained the fundamental skills for college is higher. Sixty-four percent of students met three or more of the ACT-determined benchmarks.
Over the years, USC’s average ACT score has slowly risen, showing the rise in academic expectations for its incoming students. For this year’s freshmen class, the middle 50 percent of students had a composite ACT score between 29 and 33. The highest possible score for the ACT is 36.
Director of Undergraduate Admissions Kirk Brennan said that test scores are an important factor in admission decisions, but they are not the only factor.
“Scores are worried about too much,” he said. “We’re also aware of [the tests’] limitations … I think that we know when to make a bet on a student who might show other strengths where we think that the score might not be an indicator of future success. Too often people worry about the score when they should worry about pursuing rigorous thought and intellectual growth.”
Thomas Leonard, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he doesn’t agree that the ACT is an adequate measure of a student’s college readiness.
“I don’t know if [the ACT] shows ability,” Leonard said. “Standardized tests show how hard you can study and who has the most money for tutors to help them study.”
Katie Murphy, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering, said her own personal experiences show why standardized tests are not always the best predictor.
“I didn’t do as well on the science portion as the rest of the test even though I took AP science classes in high school,” she said. “The science section wasn’t, ‘Do you know how to do this?’ but more of, ‘Can you read this graph quickly?’”
Despite some USC students’ concerns that their ACT scores don’t have a strong correlation to their actual academic ability, many still said they believe some benchmark test is needed.
“There has to be some sort of standard to show someone’s ability,” Leonard said. “You have to take tests.”
Though tests carry significance, students believe that standardized tests should highlight other strengths a college-bound person might possess.
“Some students have talents in other areas that a test cannot show,” Graham said. “Some individual talents that make students exceptional cannot always be shown on a standardized test.”

Just miles from campus, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made national news Monday after characterizing President Barack Obama’s supporters as believing they are “victims” who are dependent on government benefits.
The Romney campaign spent much of its Tuesday defending his comments, which were recorded at a private fundraiser in Los Angeles and released by the news organization Mother Jones.
“All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it,” Romney said in the video. “That, that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what … These are people who pay no income tax.”
Almost immediately after Mother Jones posted the story, his remarks were picked up on Twitter accounts and posted to Facebook pages, including those of many students.
Hyehyun Bahng, a sophomore majoring in biology, said she felt that the implications of Romney’s 47 percent comment could hurt his electoral chances.
“I definitely think it can negatively affect him because people often turn these little mistakes into something bigger,” Bahng said. “In the case of presidents, people don’t want them to make little mistakes because they could turn into a big problem if the candidate was talking to ambassadors or powerful people.”
According to presidential politics veteran Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics,   the Romney campaign’s response to his remarks will determine the speech’s affect on the election.
“Romney is going to need to spend some time in the very short term explaining the point he was trying to make,” Schnur said. “The degree to which he is successful with that explanation is going to determine how much this impacts the campaign going forward.”
Presidential gaffes are nothing new. Ironically, Schnur said, Mitt Romney’s father, Michigan governor George Romney, made one of the most notable gaffes in modern political history during his 1968 presidential bid.
“He was talking about the Vietnam war and talking about how he had been ‘brainwashed’ by generals when he was there,” Schnur said. “The point he was trying to make was that he had been given an unduly optimistic report by generals, but because he used the term ‘brainwashed,’ it caused such a backlash that he was ultimately forced to withdraw from the campaign.”
The simple fact of the mistake, not necessarily what is said alone, can be the problem, other students said.
“The mistake Romney made last night within itself is not a problem, but I think the fact that people pick it up and talk about it makes it a bigger deal,” said Ronell Firouz, a senior majoring in business administration. “The way the media compounds upon it can have an effect on his candidacy.”
Santiago Fernandez, a junior majoring in environmental studies, agreed that the media portrayal of gaffes can be the primary factor in determining voters’ responses.
“The 47 percent commment could throw him off, depending on how the media will portray it to voters,” Fernandez said. “I don’t think the people he is trying to get on his side will appreciate it.”
When covering gaffes, however, the media typically focuses on the opposing candidate’s response, Schnur said, citing Romney’s 47 percent gaffe as well as remarks from Obama earlier in the campaign about businessmen receiving help in creating companies.
“Whether it is Obama and businesses, or Romney and the 47 percent, the media reports on what the candidate said,” Schnur said. “But it’s not until the other side goes after it hard that the coverage tends to saturate.”
I am not in a union. I am not gay.  I don’t receive government benefits. I am not a prisoner or have anything to do with the media. I legally work full time and pay my taxes.  And I will be voting for Obama this November.  I even grew up in a Republican family, but I feel with a little observation and critical thinking, it is clear that the gap between rich and poor is too big in this country with the middle mostly getting lower and lower wages, and that the rich are in a position to contribute more.   That said, I do think it’s important that we have a watchful eye over government programs to shape policy to be more effective.
James,
Your own words: “…the rich are in a position to contribute more.”  It appears you believe in taking money from someone to give to someone else.  Why?  Is someone entitled to it?
The greatest thing about this country is that you can succeed, no matter who you are, if you make the right choices.  Why should those who have made the choices that have led to wealth have that wealth taken away?
How are Democrats NOT “victims” who are dependent on government benefits?
Look outside of your academic world to the REAL world! Democrats =
the Unions (bring down employers) ,
Students (favorable loans for racial groups)
Gays (recipients of AIDS benefits)
Media (gets ad revenue by covering politically correct govt. created stories)
Lasy humans with no intention of providing for themselves &/or their families (Food stamps/Welfare)
Illegal Aliens (who now don’t even have to show ID to vote for Obama)
Prisoners (free meals, TV’s, weight lifting equipment, etc., paid for by tax payers.
ALL OF THE ABOVE WILL VOTE FOR OBAMA CUZ HE GIVES THEM FREE HAND-OUTS.
ROMNEY WAS CORRECT. NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE. TRUTH IS TRUTH. LEARN FROM IT AND CHANGE FOR THE BETTER, NOT THE WORSE.

Nearly 100 local stakeholders voiced their concerns or support for USC’s proposed redevelopment of the University Village during a second public hearing on Tuesday.
The three-hour Los Angeles Planning and Land Use Management Committee hearing aimed to address a number of concerns posed by community members at a previous meeting on Aug. 28. A vote on USC’s $1.1 billion master plan, which would renovate the University Village to create new retail space and student housing, is scheduled to take place in three weeks, according to Department of City Planning President William Roschen.
The first part of the hearing was dedicated to presenting research conducted by the City Planning Department regarding concerns brought up at a previous hearing. The second portion of the hearing was left open for community members to voice their opinions.
Among those who spoke were students, small business owners and community members.
Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos emphasized the need for university and community participation at the meeting.
“More housing and retail can better foster a sense of community between USC and the surrounding community,” Geragos said. “I’m here in support of the USC Village because this opportunity will build a stronger and healthier community for us all.”
One of the main issues highlighted during the hearing was whether the project would spur job growth in the South Los Angeles area. USC’s plans for The Village forecast an increase in job growth by as many as 12,000 new jobs, 4,000 of which would be construction-based and 8,000 of which would be permanent jobs. Local advocates from an anti-displacement organization believe that the projected job creation is inflated.
“The bitter irony is that the community members who are supporting the project want the same things as we do,” said David Robinson, a representative of United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement (UNIDAD). “What they don’t understand is that these jobs aren’t guaranteed under the current plan. We fear that these same community members speaking in support are going to be displaced themselves.”
USC’s executive director of local government relations David Galaviz said that gaining public approval has been challenging with a project of this magnitude. The Village will be the largest community redevelopment project in the history of South Los Angeles.
“It’s tough to generate public support for projects like this,” Galaviz said. “Not just here at USC, but anywhere. Throughout this long process, we’ve aimed to educate the community on the benefits that this project will have not only to the university but to the surrounding community.”
Though UNIDAD supports the plan to bring new jobs to the area, they question to whom these jobs will actually be going. Though the university has proposed leaving 30 percent of jobs to local residents within a 10-mile radius, UNIDAD representative Joe Donlin said that this is not enough to ensure these jobs go to members of the community.
“We want to see local families and residents get into those jobs,” Donlin said. “To keep a community together, we need 40 percent of permanent jobs going to local residents, starting within a two-mile radius for the first year.”
The planning department analyzed what other universities similar to USC are doing to deal with some of the local issues raised at previous hearings, specifically those regarding how to deal with student housing, business retention and local hiring.
The university hopes to attract students with low prices to the housing it plans to construct in the new University Village. According to Galaviz, housing will be offered on the second floor of the University Village structure and retail space will be on the ground floor.
“What we want to be able to do is price housing below current market rate to incentivize students to choose to live in USC-controlled housing as opposed to [choose] private housing market,” Galaviz said.
The City Planning Department presented research that compares housing and community involvement at other universities. The agency found that the University of Chicago houses 66 percent of its students, Columbia University houses 95 percent of its students and Harvard University houses 97 percent of its students. By comparison, USC only houses 29 percent of its students, all of whom are undergraduates, according to the Department of City Planning.
UNIDAD also said it believes the university’s plan to increase student housing will not satisfy the need, especially as USC accepts more students. The organization is concerned that students will look for housing in surrounding residential neighborhoods, displacing residents.
“The plan itself only requires a minimum of 1,200 beds,” Robinson said. “Student housing needs to be at the very least the full 4,200 [beds] permitted under the plan and it has to be priced affordably. As long as the housing units aren’t affordable, there will be no relief for the community.”
According to Kristina Raspe, vice president for real estate and asset management at USC, the overall support of the plan from both sides is encouraging. Raspe said the additional demands made by opponents of the plan, however, are not the responsibility of the university.
“I’m very happy that everyone is supportive of the project itself,” Raspe said. “The overwhelming number of community members who come to the hearings who are opposed to the development agreement simply want more community benefits. They want the university to provide more funds for affordable housing despite the fact that the project has a positive impact on the availability of affordable housing in the neighborhood. The university shouldn’t have to bear that burden.”
Attitudes of USC administrators  like Krtstina Raspe got two Trojans murdered last year.  And yet still she continues
to say that housing students is not USC’s “burden.” How many more USC students must die and how
many more places will USC fall in national rankings before it obtains responsible leadership that will make safe and affordable student housing a priority?
I’m with the others who are appalled at all this criticism from a community that has greatly benefited from USC’s efforts over the years and will no doubt benefit much more from this project.
That said…I firmly hope that USC really maxes out the student housing space available.  Housing is still a major disadvantage that USC has compared to other top-tier universities.  It’s essential that they provide enough top-quality, reasonably priced student housing to at least try to match UCLA’s 3 years of guaranteed on-campus housing.
With everything USC does for this community, I say it’s high time the community do its share and allow USC to build upon its own land, with its own money, while providing jobs for everyone. 
USC was here long before this particular community was here–enough of the “Shake-Down”, UNIDAD. Call the government for your handouts, not USC.
I think if they added a skate park as a major element of the UV project many of the those who are currently against would reconsider.
1200 beds only ?  Seems small for a billion dollars.  I don’t agreed with those protesting but I would prefer to see alot more beds then that.  I’m mean they usually stick four kids in a room so do the math.  That is less then  Gateway.
What is California coming to?   USC wants to spend $1 BILLION dollars in the community and one of the sticking points is that UNIDAD want jobs guaranteed regardless of whether someone has an aptitude for the job?  If local residents are qualified for the jobs available, then they will surely be hired.  If they are not qualified, the jobs will go to other Californians who are.  Making USC guarantee that 40% of the jobs will go to residents within a 2-mile radius is un-American.  This country was built on the theory that we all, regardless of race, sex, color, religion or location of our homes, COMPETE for jobs which creates employees who constantly strive to IMPROVE.  We are not a socialist (yet) country which makes businesses guarantee who and from where they must hire.  California is being run into the ground by organizations like this which are more interested in their own political agenda than truly improving the lives of the folks living in the neighborhood b/c even without guaranteeing these jobs, improving the area creates greater safety, improved traffic flow, a more beautiful part of town, more money flowing into the area and prestige for the area increasing everyone’s property values.

The No. 2 USC women’s volleyball team is set to face crosstown rival and top-ranked UCLA on Wednesday at the Galen Center. Coming off of four straight weekends that have ended with tournament wins, the Women of Troy (12-0) won’t catch a break, opening up Pac-12 play with their toughest challenge so far this season.
Rivalry · Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio has led USC to a 12-0 start. They play UCLA Wednesday, winners of the 2011 national title. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
The game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. and will be televised on ESPNU.
Unlike USC, the Bruins (8-1) have already had a misstep so far this year, despite their No. 1 rank, after stumbling to Nebraska during the first week of the season. Since then, though, UCLA has rattled off seven straight wins behind the play of senior leaders Rachael Kidder and Tabi Love.
Coincidentally enough, the Women of Troy counter the senior outside hitters of UCLA with a pair of freshman who have played well beyond their years during the early part of this season. Leading the pack has been freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio, a native of Guadalajara, Mexico, who has burst onto the national scene with her stellar play at the net.
Along with Bricio, fellow freshman Alicia Ogoms has started to come on strong, as her playing time has slowly begun to increase. At 6-4, Ogoms has displayed an uncanny knack for the big block, even in part-time duty, and has flashed the ability to be a dominant force at the net as the season goes on.
Supplementing the play of the pair of freshman has been junior All-American libero Natalie Hagglund and potential All-American and senior captain Katie Fuller.
After playing a marginal role on last year’s Final Four team, Fuller has been a dominant force from the off-hand position and has gracefully taken on the job of being the elder statesman of the group. While her hitting has been excellent, the senior opposite hitter has continued to impress with her passing as she has set and then broken her career-high for digs in a game.
In the back row, Hagglund doesn’t have a pretty job, but her serve-receive and passing prowess has been a boon to the undefeated Women of Troy. Constantly moving and hustling, the libero provides playoff experience and sets the tone for USC on and off the court.
Over their last 10 matches against each other, USC and UCLA have an even split at 5-5, with the Women of Troy garnering the last win at the end of the 2011 season. For USC, Wednesday’s game is their first chance to successfully defend the Pac-12 title they earned last season.
Though the 2012 season is still in its infantile stages, it is never too early for a tough test, even against a conference rival. For a team like the Women of Troy that lack big-game experience as a group, Wednesday’s game is a great way to gauge both where the team is and where it might end up.

It’s a fine line student journalists walk, being neutral as a media member, while also still a fan as a student.
But this column is not written by a journalist and a media member. This column is written by a student and a fan of the University of Southern California. And I am way beyond that aforementioned line right now.
Dejected · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has had his fair share of struggles against Stanford, having never beaten them in four tries. He and the Trojans may have a chance at redemption in the Pac-12 Championship Game. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
So in the interest of full disclosure, I hate Stanford.
Yes, hate is a strong word. It’s a word with powerful connotations that should not be thrown around lightly. But, I mean, really, I hate the Cardinal.
At the Farm last Saturday, I was with a friend of mine who goes to Stanford. We were talking before the game, and he looked at me and asked rhetorically, “You guys really want to beat us, don’t you?”
I was at a loss for words to describe my immense and total desire to do exactly that. I grew up a California fan in the Bay Area. One of my fondest memories remains storming the field at Stanford Stadium after the Golden Bears won the Big Game there in 2009. I was bred to hate Stanford.
When Stanford stunned USC in 2007, I was disappointed they were taking the limelight. When the Trojans smacked around the Cardinal in 2008, I figured all was right again in the world.
Then there was the infamous game when Stanford mercilessly ran up the score on the Trojans at the Coliseum in 2009 which was followed by the awkward Jim Harbaugh-Pete Carroll confrontation. That was scary. In 2010, the Trojans almost pulled off a huge upset in Palo Alto, Calif., losing on a last-second field goal. And then, of course, there was the triple-overtime classic of 2011.
Before Saturday’s game, I figured USC had been close, and now they were due for a win. I wanted the team to go up north and not just win, but dominate. I wanted for the Trojans to lay a beat-down on Stanford so bad it would almost eliminate the pain of those other losses. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley needed to throw seven touchdowns. Stanford had to give us two pick-sixes and three fumble recoveries. I wanted a Curtis McNeal 70-yard touchdown run. Sophomore defensive tackle George Uko and junior defensive end Morgan Breslin needed to eat someone, too.
I wanted everything.
What I should have wanted, however, was something far simpler:  a victory.
One simple tick in the ‘W’ column for these Trojans against Stanford, that first real piece of “unfinished business.” Now it looks as though that particular bit of business might be left unfinished.
Unless …
Immediately after the game, I thought about the Trojan’s BCS title hopes. I realized that a loss in game number three does not completely derail those. I realized, also, that the Trojans still control their own destiny to the Rose Bowl, where they would presumably beat up on some hopelessly overrated Big Ten team and could certainly count that as finishing said “business.”
But eventually the pure and untempered Stanford hatred running through my veins took over, and I realized there was something far, far more important to me: a rematch.
I want USC and Stanford to play for the Pac-12 championship on Nov.30. And for that, despite every bone in my body aching to the contrary, I want Stanford to win the rest of their regular season games. I want them to win at Washington, at Oregon and at UCLA. I want them to beat all of USC’s other rivals. I want them to do whatever they need to do to make sure they win the Pac-12 North.
And I want that title game in Palo Alto, in their house. I want the Trojans to go up there, 11-1, with the sourest of sour tastes in their mouths and to face 12-0 Stanford, one game away from playing for the national championship. I want Matt Barkley and company to finish their business in the most dramatic possible way. I want Stanford to fail on the biggest possible stage.
And in that case, a win would be more than enough. I don’t need Stanford punched in the face. I don’t need anyone to get eaten. I just want them beat. And I want it to be USC who does it.
Talk about finishing business.

It’s USC’s world, you’re just living it!
Yeah.. quit whining.  This season is officially over.  No heisman, no national championship, not even a pac-12 championship.  We play to finish.. the slogan that jinxed our season.  Sux.. oh well, Tuck da Frojans!
My wife went to SC – she’s embarrassed by you. I went to Stanford – it’s a game, dude. You don’t need to behave as if the Serbs killed all your goats. Grow a pair. Suck it up. Quit whining.

At the first practice after USC’s loss to Stanford on Tuesday, the message was clear: It’s time to move on.
USC coach Lane Kiffin expressed his team’s excitement for Saturday’s game against California, even joking that he wished it were baseball, so his team could have the opportunity to bounce back quicker.

“Good to be back out on the field I think for everybody, for our coaches, for our players,” Kiffin said. “Get rid of last week like we’ve talked about. We’re moving forward, but it’s always good to get the pads on and get back here and get to football.”
The Trojan coach is addressing several problems he identified on game film — most notably, offensive line play.
He has officially opened up sophomore Aundrey Walker’s starting left tackle position for competition. Over the next two days, Walker and freshman Max Tuerk will vie for the starting nod to protect senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s blindside.
Kiffin also expounded upon his criteria for making the decision.
“Finish, great effort,” Kiffin said. “We won’t tolerate lack of great effort. I think Aundrey’s going to respond well to this.”
—
During the loss to Stanford, freshman center Cyrus Hobbi, as expected with a nuanced position, experienced some growing pains. On one sack in the second half, Hobbi snapped the ball on the wrong snap count, leading to a flood of Stanford players in the backfield.
Still, after the game, Kiffin made sure to applaud his effort.
“Hang in there,” said Kiffin to Hobbi postgame. “[I’m] proud of the way that [you] competed, and we’re behind [you].”
According to Kiffin, senior center Abe Markowitz, who was No. 2 on the depth chart before Stanford, is healthy and available to play this week. If Holmes is unavailable to play against California, Markowitz will assume the starting center position over Hobbi.
—
Kiffin also insisted that California’s 1-2 record belies a talented and physical team.
“They’re [a] very talented team in general in all three phases. … Some guys on defense that give you some issues in the front,” Kiffin said. “There’s some pretty dominant players in there that give people a lot of issues last year, including us at times — another complicated defense.”
—
Though California quarterback Zach Maynard struggled against USC last season, Kiffin has seen growth from the lefty on recent game film.
“That was the best I’ve seen from him on film,” said Kiffin of Maynard’s performance against Ohio State last weekend. “He played really well in a tough game. I think you can tell that he’s improved. ”

With the 64th annual primetime Emmys hitting the small screen this Sunday, it seems as though all anyone can talk about these days is television: Will three-time winner Bryan Cranston claim a fourth Emmy for his flawless performance as Walter White in Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad? Will freshman series Homeland take down the reigning champion, Matthew Weiner’s Mad Men? Does any comedy really stand a chance against Modern Family?
The quality of the nominees just goes to show that television has upped its game. More than just an excuse to give out another round of tiny gold statues, the Emmys — and the shows that it celebrates — engenders another round of the age-old television-versus-film debate. To sum it up: How does television’s new status compare to that of film, and which is the better medium?
Vulture’s Gavin Polone addressed this issue last week in his article “The Main Reason TV Is Now Better Than Movies,” arguing that the studios’ reliance on financial security rather than passion projects has led to the decline of originality. He claims that television reigns supreme as it delivers more interesting, creative works to a wider audience.
Many viewers agree with Polone, who also believes in the “nothing out worth seeing” reason for not going to theaters.
That’s just an excuse from a lazy mindset. People tend to be passive about film — if they really want to find the next modern American classic, they should just do their research (obviously, critics can be helpful here) and seek out films themselves.
It’s not like there’s a dearth of great films. Take a look at this summer’s Beasts of the Southern Wild: The indie film was one of the most critically praised of the year — it’s surely Oscar bound — yet was ridiculously underrated, attracting little mainstream attention.
As with any medium, film has seen its misses. Let’s face it — the last thing the film industry needs is another John Carter or Battleship. These misses, however, don’t suggest film is a lesser medium than TV. In fact, the entire argument is unnecessary: TV and film are completely distinct mediums, and should accordingly be treated and judged individually.
Most notably,  we must evaluate TV and film on their own terms because of their disparate narrative structures, which have a trickle-down effect on the development of characters and storylines, among other critical elements.
Film, on one hand, uses a dramatic structure and has to hook you from the very beginning as a result — it’s faster-paced by nature, allowing the audience to be shocked, sad, overjoyed and every kind other kind of emotion, all in a nice two-hour package.
TV’s episodic structure, however, boasts the longevity to develop a slower plot, invest the audience in the characters and grow those characters over time. Think about it: A regular season of TV can have roughly between 10 to 14 episodes. Multiply that by however many seasons, and you have what seems like an eternity to unveil a story.
Think of it this way: Breaking Bad follows a high school chemistry teacher with lung cancer, Walter White, who begins cooking crystal meth so that he can better provide for his family. Would the audience still sympathize with Walter if they didn’t have the time to see his background and motivations unfold? Probably not.
Walter is one of television’s leading antiheroes — someone you can’t help but root for even as he becomes increasingly more corrupt. Crucially, audiences continue to support Walter — despite of his massive flaws — because they had the time to invest themselves in his personal story. In fact, the increasingly popular narrative of the anti-hero simply does not translate as well to film: It takes too much time to grow genuine sympathy toward a character like Walter or Mad Men’s Don Draper.
At their cores, the media of film and TV are just different from each other: not better or worse, just different. Though there haven’t been many American classics in film lately, that doesn’t mean film is a lesser medium than TV, which happens to be on fire right now. Nor would the opposite be true.
Emmys fever aside, we, as consumers of art, need to re-conceptualize the way we perceive film, TV and their relationship in order to understand these mediums correctly — on their own terms.

One of the most daunting phrases in pop culture is “one-man show,” both for performers and audience members.
When executed poorly, a one-man show can be a miserable experience for everyone. Ninety minutes of listening to just one person talk? That sounds like a boring lecture, or worse, a bad date.
Standout performance · Judy Jean Berns captivates audiences as Joan Didion in the one-woman show, The Year of Magical Thinking. – | Photo courtesy of Garrison Burrell
But when done correctly, a one-man show can be a singularly splendid theatrical experience, moving and emotionally powerful. Thankfully, this is the case with The Year of Magical Thinking, the Bright Eyes Production onstage now at the Elephant Stages in Santa Monica.
The play is based on Joan Didion’s book of the same title, which recounts the shockingly sad two-year period of Didion’s life that saw her lose her husband to a heart attack and her daughter to complications from cerebral bleeding and septic shock. Published in 2005, the book received high critical praise, winning that year’s National Book Award for Nonfiction and earning nominations for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize.
For those unfamiliar with Joan Didion or her work, this production serves as an excellent introduction to both. Didion, born in 1934, is a prolific writer of novels, essays and screenplays, and has enjoyed loyal readership since the late 1960s. Didion and her husband, John Dunne, were something of a power couple; not only were they both literary stars in their own right (Dunne was a renowned journalist for Time), but they were a respected screenwriting team. The pair enjoyed a relatively high-profile social life, participated in the New York and Los Angeles scenes and ensured that their adopted daughter, Quintana Roo, was well prepared for life as a socialite. Didion herself remains an iconic literary figure, a renowned proponent of feminism and a skillful wordsmith.
In the play, the character of Joan is written as an elegant but shaken woman unequipped to deal with such a massive personal tragedy. Originally starring Vanessa Redgrave on Broadway and in the West End, this L.A. premiere features the luminous Judy Jean Berns as Joan, who brings mesmerizing believability to the role. Berns paints Didion as graceful, strong-willed and unrelentingly smart. Because the age of the character and the actress allow for — and require — little movement, Berns imbues every small step with significance, letting her tempestuous emotions guide her around the small stage. Her rigid posture and nervous hand-wringing convey the inner warfare between maintaining her composure and giving in to total sadness. Berns’ understated use of props, especially her light fidgeting with a bracelet that originally belonged to her deceased daughter, lends a real degree of authenticity to her performance — it really feels like listening to a friend of your grandmother’s talk about her sad past on the front porch.
This effect is enhanced by the sparse set — just a white wicker chair and small side table with two of the books Didion mentions and a glass of water, set against a blue-lit backdrop — and extremely limited use of sound effects. Berns’ costume further cements the image of Didion as a classy old lady: a simple gray dress paired with a drapey lavender sweater, embellished with beautiful jewelry.
Berns’ interpretation of Didion’s work is stunning, but the play itself is a star in its own right. The clarity of the language Didion employs to pinpoint her exact feelings in each stage of her grief makes her struggle extremely relatable. Didion’s obsessive research into the medical aspects of both deaths is extremely prominent in the content of the play, demonstrating her powerful intellect, attention to detail and desperate need to analyze and understand the world around her.
In addition, Didion’s work with the chronology of her story is artful, interweaving Proust-like sensory flashbacks with the actual timeline, granting the audience insight into how joyful her life had been before being interrupted by her family’s death. Didion’s words demonstrate how she would careen among the varying emotions that accompany grief: peaceful one moment, then enraged, then finally depressed. As she explains in the beginning of the play, her aim in writing this was to prepare her listeners for how very unprepared they would be when a tragedy inevitably strikes. And she succeeds.
This play, thought-provoking and captivating, is incredibly well done. It’s a must-see for fans of Didion, or for those who just need a little catharsis. With the sprawling Santa Monica Boulevard theater scene just a few minutes away, it would be a crime not to take advantage of the smorgasbord of entertainment offered there.
 
The Year of Magical Thinking runs at the Elephant Stages theater in Santa Monica. Sat., Sep 08–Sun., Oct. 14. Tickets are $25.

As present-day literature continues to focus on lengthy plots and dramatic turns on every page, it’s easy to forget that the setting of a novel was once just as important as the protagonists.
In 1831, Victor Hugo dedicated chapters of The Hunchback of Notre Dame to characterizing the streets of Paris. Santa Monica came to life in the pages of Raymond Chandler’s 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely.
And while the plots of present-day bestsellers like Toni Morrison’s Home and Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being a Wallflower are enjoyable, they just don’t depend on setting the way their predecessors did.
But Zadie Smith, author of White Teeth and On Beauty, takes readers back to the old trend with her new novel, NW, where the Willesden community of northwest London forms the centerpiece of the narrative.
NW  follows the interconnecting stories of Leah, Felix, Natalie and Nathan, childhood friends who struggle with growing up in different class backgrounds within the same community. The Caldwell estate of Willesden alternately captures and releases these characters: Despite the fact that these Londoners try their hardest to escape Caldwell, each is haunted by some element of their past and is prevented from truly starting over.
Leah, a married woman in her early 30s, struggles to accommodate her husband’s desires for children. She would much rather focus her maternal energies on her dog, Olive. Felix longs to escape his dark past and his father’s influence but is constantly held back by the woman he used to love. Natalie, the “woman who has everything,” continuously attempts and fails to find satisfaction from her marriage, her children and ultimately her law career. Finally, Nathan, a neighborhood drug dealer, serves as the novel’s centerpiece, appearing in each   narrative and reminding the characters of what they could have become.
For NW, Smith relies on extreme polarization. The novel explores continual highs and lows: motherhood and childlessness, glory and failure, privilege and work ethic. If the characters fluctuate from one end of the spectrum to another, the readers are forever stranded in a liminal state, gathering glimpses from all of these separate worlds and understanding. Still, though Smith has enough material here for four novels, she organizes NW around one central question: How do we end up where we are?
“I just don’t understand why I have this life,” says Leah in the novel’s final few pages. “You, me, all of us. Why that girl and not us. Why that poor bastard on Albert Road. It doesn’t make sense to me.”
And though her best friend Natalie responds, “We were smarter and we knew we didn’t want to end up begging on other people’s doorsteps,” Smith chooses to leave the answer up to the audience. By the end of NW, notions of fate and free will are just as unclear as they were on the first page, and it is up to the reader to decide whether or not these characters have truly “made it” in the world.
But Smith doesn’t make this decision easy. Her characters avoid a standard cookie-cutter format, and their behaviors are alternately attractive and appalling. Cheating and adultery seem to be regular occurrences in the novel, as are abortion, drug addiction and violence. Ironically, the drug-addicted Nathan seems to be the most redemptive character. Though Natalie, Leah and Felix have, arguably, escaped their original community, readers doubt whether or not they’re truly better off. Here again, Smith leaves another layer of ambiguity.
Still, despite the novel’s heavy thematic elements and complex characters, Smith’s prose forms the highlight of NW. The author’s writing style leaps from the page as Smith plays with font size, punctuation and even poetry. In the first section of the novel, “Visitation,” Smith, instead of describing a character’s features in standard prose, creates a “word-image” of Leah’s coworker’s mouth, substituting words for where the character’s teeth, fillings and tongue would be in an ordinary image. Then, several pages later in “Host,” Smith describes Natalie’s honeymoon in a series of words; Choppy phrases like “Sun. Prosecco. Sky, bleached,” and “He swims. Every day,” tell the reader everything he or she needs to know by conjuring up a series of pleasant images.
In fact, much of NW shies away from full-fledged sentences. Smith instead uses lists of adjectives, descriptive fragments and even snippets from emails to weave a complex narrative and conjure up appropriate emotions from the audience. Even if readers don’t have a final answer to the “fate versus free will” question, there’s very little doubt as to whether Smith is a master of the English language.
NW’s honest narration of its four characters and its relevant questions of chance and free will make the book a modern masterpiece. And despite its dark topics and heartbreaking ending, the novel remains startlingly optimistic.
Perhaps we can’t shape our destinies, but the lessons of the past give us the opportunity to make the best of our future.

In an upstairs room of The Roxy Theatre last Friday, Sept. 14, Davey Havok and Jade Puget sat on a bright turquoise couch, relaxing until showtime. As the electronic act Blaqk Audio, the duo was neither nervous nor hyper: they were excited about the night’s concert, part of the West Coast tour for their new album, Bright Black Heaven.
A few hours later, the two would be entertaining a packed crowd, with Havok dancing across the stage and Puget standing behind a setup emblazoned with the band’s logo.

Bright Black Heaven is something of a different beast compared to Blaqk Audio’s previous album, CexCells. After releasing their debut, the two worked on a new album for their other act, AFI, before returning their focus to Blaqk Audio. The new album is much more uptempo than the previous one, and there is a bit more of a dance focus.
“To us it’s, ‘Here are the songs we wrote,’” Puget said. “I guess when you think of CexCells, there are a lot of slow songs, relatively, but it’s just how it came out. There was no plan for that.”
The new album also touches on themes that CexCells did not, such as betrayal, affairs and indulgence.
As Havok said, “The commentaries are completely different between those two records.”
Havok also said he didn’t set out with a lyrical focus or structure in mind when beginning to work on Bright Black Heaven. Instead, the words came out of the development process, specifically with the music Puget created. Havok listened to that, and then started writing.
“With Bright Black Heaven, that transcendence that can be achieved through the mundane or through music that I’m hearing or we’re creating is what led me in that lyrical direction,” he said.
In the process of recording the album, the duo recorded more than 30 songs. Though the final product only has 12 songs, some tracks ended up on special releases of Bright Black Heaven or were released online: Havok and Puget don’t like to abandon what they’ve worked on.
“We could do an EP, [or those leftover songs] could be on the next record,” Puget said. “Anything we usually finish is something we like.”
Part of the duo’s enthusiasm for Blaqk Audio comes from being able to do live shows. Their sets include songs from both albums — and their show at The Roxy featured an Erasure cover during the encore — but both members have a few songs that they especially love to perform live.
“‘Bon Voyeurs’ is really fun,” Puget said. “‘Say Red’ is probably the fastest song I’ve ever written. In fact, it’s probably too fast to dance to.”
“Yeah, it’s happy hardcore,” Havok added. “‘Everybody’s Friends’ is one of my favorite songs. And I really really like ‘Cold War.’ We open with that and I think it sets a nice tone for the rest of the evening and the record.”
Outside of their own music, Havok and Puget are fans of a number of acts in the electronic music scene, from older bands such as Depeche Mode to more modern musicians.
“I love the poppier side, the mainstream side of dance music, personally,” Havok said. “Swedish House Mafia, David Guetta, Kaskade and Afrojack, I think they’re great.”
Even though Blaqk Audio explored dance music more in its second album, the duo doesn’t see itself as really being a part of the electronic dance music scene. Unlike much of EDM, according to Puget, Blaqk Audio doesn’t often create dance loops, instead using song structures for its tracks. Also, unlike much of EDM, Havok performs live vocals at each show.
“We’ll do a fast song, then we have a slow song, like a normal band. That doesn’t fit in [other kinds of electronic music] at all,” Puget said. “Like, Underworld is something that has a live vocalist but there’s so many things about us that aren’t that. We love that thing, but we love what we do too.”
But despite the differences between Blaqk Audio and those other electronic acts, the band does not think that anything needs to change, or that one subgenre within the electronic scene should become the standard or only subgenre.
“I don’t think there’s anything missing from dance music or electronic music. Really, less so than ever before,” Havok said. “With the resurgence of electronica here in America, we haven’t really had such an acceptance of the general genre since the early ’90s. There has been such a greater expanse of different artistry within the greater genre. And we’re hearing so much progress in all the little different niches of music, none of which we fit in at all.”

Trojans don’t just visit Los Angeles, they also taste it. In an effort to introduce students to more local restaurants and cuisine, USC Program Board Special Events Committee presented Taste of Downtown LA on Tuesday afternoon at McCarthy Quad.
“It’s a chance for students to taste a little of the food [from these local restaurants], see if they like it and then if they do then they can go and support them,” said Amy Gong, Program Board director of special events.

This is the third year that the event, which runs once a semester, has been put on. This year, Taste of Downtown featured 10 different restaurants and food trucks with cuisine ranging from a healthy twist on European street food to New England summer favorites.
“In Downtown L.A. the food culture is so big, and I really want the students to get involved in that culture,” Gong said.
Bryce Rademan, the owner of Spitz, said his restaurant puts a twist on a European food similar to shwarma.
“We basically took a European street food called doner kebab and elevated it, made it lighter, fresher, healthier with all the great flavors,” Rademan said. “It’s really simple fresh ingredients done well.”
Rademan said that his restaurant is a great place for college students to hang out.
“We geared it toward that demographic,” Rademan said. “We have a location in Little Tokyo which is a favorite of USC. We have a full bar there — beers, wines, sangrias — students come for USC football games, sporting events. It has a really cool, party-type vibe.”
At the event, Ozero, a coffee, juice and smoothie place, gave out milk teas and chai teas in addition to strawberry cake samples.
“We do have the best boba in Little Tokyo. We’re very known for that,” said Kevin Liu, Ozero’s manager. “A lot of people name us the best boba in Downtown Los Angeles, so that’s something to be proud of.”
Liu hopes that Ozero’s presence at Taste will attract different customers.
“A lot of students here like tea,” he said. “We want to attract more students to check it out, do homework and chill here.”
Gilberto Cetina’s family-run restaurant Chichen Itza, located only a few blocks from USC in the Mercado la Paloma complex, features authentic southern Mexican food from the Yucatan Peninsula.
“We brought probably the most representative dish here today, tacos de cochinita pibil,” Cetina said. “It’s basically suckled pig braised and wrapped in brown leaves with citrus and marinade. We cook it for 12 hours very slow, so it comes out very tender. We’re featuring it in tacos with pickled onions and a little habanero sauce.”
Cetina said that the restaurant makes it a point to give back to USC when possible because the USC community has been so supportive of his restaurant.
“Now we’re 12 years old, but in the beginning it was really difficult,” Cetina said. “It was kind of through the support of different departments at USC, which gave us catering jobs and support, that we’re here today. We love USC and we’re happy to use this opportunity to expose more people to our food and also give back to the university that has really given us a lot in terms of business and catering.”
A newcomer to the event this year was the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Ashley Moreno, the marketing and events director for the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, said that they were there to promote the newly launched single serve beverage system.
“It brews coffee, tea and espresso,” Moreno said. “Students can sample the hot beverages to demo the machines. We think they would be perfect for the whole college life, you can put it in your apartment or dorm room.”
Another type of beverage at the event was lemon ice samples from Del’s Lemonade food truck. Van Fraiser, the driver for the Del’s Lemonade food truck, said that Del’s is unique because it originated on that other coast.
“Del’s lemonade is a New England tradition in the summer,” Fraiser said of the Rhode Island-based company. “We’re glad to bring it out here to the west coast so more people can enjoy it.”
Fraiser’s favorite thing about the ice is its texture.
“It’s all natural, very light lemonade, not overly syrupy,” Fraiser said.
With such variety at the fair, students experienced an enjoyable and informative afternoon.
Kaylyn Sung, a junior studying computer science and business administration, could definitely see herself making the trip to some restaurants.
“The Italian one is really good, they gave me their menu and I was actually just talking [to a friend] about going there sometime,” Sung said. “The ravioli was great.”
Saravanan Ganesh, a first year graduate student studying computer science, said he found out about the event on Facebook and was excited to learn about more eating options in the area.
“I’m new to L.A. and so this is a nice opportunity to find out some new eateries and get to know L.A. better,” Ganesh said.
But Isabel Lee, a sophomore majoring in business administration, seemed to best sum up the mood of the face-stuffing crowd, when she explained what she liked about Taste of L.A.
“This is one of my favorite events all year that program board throws,” Le said. “They have a lot of cool places, there’s free food, what’s not to like?”

Two weeks ago, an attack ad from conservative super PAC Campaign for American Values aired throughout North Carolina.
The ad shows a woman reading a newspaper with an alarmed expression on her face, talking with her husband. “Obama is trying to force gay marriage on this country. Marriage is between a man and a woman. That’s not the change I voted for,” she says. Her husband replies, “That’s not the change I voted for either.” The woman then asks, “What can we do?” Her husband’s response: “We can vote for someone with values.” The ad then fades into a “Vote Romney/Ryan” banner.
This is a blatant propaganda play by Campaign for American Values, meant only to reinforce a political talking point.
Propaganda can be defined, in this context, as an advertisement meant to influence the opinion of voters through the use of an emotional appeal, and without any tangible and verifiable facts. Campaign ads shouldn’t be reduced to smearing propaganda — they should inform the viewer of pertinent election issues, ideas or potential policies that will help the viewer cast a well-informed vote.
In this particular ad, the exchange between the woman and her husband — complete with ominous music playing in the background — makes for an ad so absurd that it is difficult to believe that anyone, regardless of their stance on gay marriage, would be convinced by it. This ad was not created as an effort to inform people about President Barack Obama’s stance on gay marriage, but rather as a means to deliver a critical message of Mitt Romney’s campaign.
Enforcing the image of Romney as the candidate with values implies that this is what sets him apart from Obama. Therefore, this campaign ad is not intended to inform viewers of anything relevant, but is instead used as a means to solidify a biased image in the minds of the viewers.
There is something fundamentally wrong with that. Since the Citizens United case in 2010, in which the Supreme Court ruled that unlimited corporate and union spending in political campaigns is protected under the First Amendment, America has seen an incredible increase in advertisements from third party organizations unaffiliated with official presidential campaigns. Because they are not officially connected with the campaigns, these advertisements are not subject to the same rules and regulations that the Federal Election Commission applies to official ads.
Though legally acknowledged as free speech, advertisements of this nature more appropriately fall under the category of propaganda, which is not permissible on public airwaves as mandated by the Federal Communications Commission. Therefore, it is within the power of the FCC to designate campaign advertisements as fact, not propaganda, because they are broadcasting over publicly owned airwaves. In addition, the FEC is in the position to assert authority over super PACs and as such, these organizations should be reporting to the FEC. Pressure should be applied to the FCC and FEC to apply restrictions on the types of advertisements that super PACs are permitted to run.
This would curb the number of inane and vacuous propaganda ads.  Perhaps then, political ads might have a shred of sense in them — whether it’s hard facts about the economy or direct quotes about each candidate’s policies — and actually provide useful information to voters.
 
Matt Tinoco is a freshman majoring  in international relations. 
Matt, I understand this is an opinion column and you lean left, but since your column is titled “Campaign advertisements should focus on presenting facts”  you should also have brought up the ad by obama leaning PAC that stated that Romney was responsible for someone’s wife’s death because she was laid off from a Bain company. Blatant lies. The wife died 5 years after the fact. 
To get any credibility please present a balanced view.

For many high school students, the months after applying to college become an incredibly fragile time.
Uncertainty about the future makes this group particularly vulnerable to external social and political influences, especially when these influences come from colleges themselves. Taking advantage of this vulnerability will ultimately damage higher education by cultivating a student body that cannot think for itself.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
But in its desperation to prevent further budget cuts to public schools, the Cal State system is doing just this by telling their applicants to vote yes on Proposition 30.
In place of the traditional note thanking students for their interest, 2012 Cal State applicants will, according to the Los Angeles Times, receive an explicit warning that reads, “Because enrollment capacity is tied to the amount of available state funding, the campuses will be able to admit more applicants if Proposition 30 passes and fewer applicants if the proposition fails,” according to a draft of a letter to be emailed to Cal State Monterey Bay applicants in October.
It seems like a brilliant move strategically: Remind students, who too often blow off state legislation as irrelevant, just how high a struggling economy makes the stakes for public education. A state budget crisis and extreme cuts are threatening college education — their college education — and students have the power to do something about it.
But Cal State’s packaging of this reminder into a receipt-of-application letter sends a message that each student’s admission or rejection is contingent on how he or she votes come November.
As Cal State isn’t about to carry out high caliber espionage, there is no way for them to actually know how prospective students are voting.
But the threat can be enough. Some student voters will undoubtedly associate voting on Prop. 30 with their admission to college, possibly influencing them to vote in a way they would not otherwise. In an opposite effect, it might also drive young voters to shirk their civic responsibility and abstain from voting altogether — ironic, considering the efforts made by many universities to get students interested in voting.
As with programs encouraging student political engagement, colleges and universities do have a role to play in influencing communities of young people. USC, for example, consistently tries to influence the student body to support their policy decisions and exhibit Trojan pride.
But, as college students, we must be wary of the messages universities are trying to send and how they choose to send them. We cannot, for example, accept the athletic department’s “Victory Emails” as absolute proof that we have the best sports team in the nation, or assume that when USC announces the advantages of a new community construction plan, they are telling us the whole story.
In Cal State’s case, the admissions department is, intentionally or otherwise, using applicant anxiety to influence voting decisions. Ultimately, though, high emotion will only inhibit the ability of students to understand the action they are taking.
College is supposed to be a time where we hone our skills as individual critical thinkers. Part of this means that we must acknowledge that college and university systems exercise considerable influence over many different facets of our lives. Young voters must learn to be wary of attempts like that of the Cal State system to infringe upon the decision-making autonomy of its applicants. Otherwise, we might leave college more uneducated than when we started.

Taxes and supposed freebies are a trap. Think about every government purchase you have ever heard about. Was it a good price? If you want education, roads, healthcare, meds, or anything else for you individually, who has your back? Some politician? A reporter? An activist? A federal employee? A person you paid directly? Your parent?
This is outrageous that they are intimidating applicants to their political leanings
AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT. 
Looks like the broke liberal democrats are getting desperate trying such a despicable strategy?
Do they really have to BULLY others to get their way?
Seems that they are no different from the Unions, Islam, Gays, Illegals, Dicktators, etc.
The common denominator here is FEAR.
It takes a person with integrity & guts to stand up to these Hyenas & show them a better way.

Walking around campus and talking to a variety of students can lead to the discovery of a wide range of  tricks to get more out of your college budget. Here are three highly recommended shortcuts.
 
eBay
You can find almost anything you want from eBay with dramatic price reductions. One of the drawbacks of eBay is that it does take time to find what you are looking for. If you do find something, the money you save makes the experience worth the wait and extra energy. With eBay, focus on finding jewelry and print t-shirts to get the best finds.
 
American Apparel Factory Store
The American Apparel Factory Store, which is within minutes of campus, is an easier alternative to eBay. There you will be able to acquire almost everything your heart desires. Be sure to assess your picks carefully as some of the products are slightly damaged. This location is a fantastic place to find fashion-savvy, paint party attire.
 
Goodwill
You don’t have to be a tailor to transform these cheap finds into masterpieces. A great project to start with is to finding an old pair of jeans and snipping them away to form dynamic, unique cut offs. Also, take lackluster t-shirts and experiment with the old pieces to see if you can add a new inventive twist. Try cutting the sleeves to make a tank top, or if you are feeling really daring, cut off the bottom to make a crop top. While in Goodwill, keep an eye out for large denim shirts — one of the latest street trends that would normaly be overpriced in retail stores.

Junior Nikola Vavic of the water polo team netted his first MPSF Player of the Week award by scoring 12 goals throughout the NorCal Tournament over the weekend, helping the Trojans win their third straight NorCal title. The highlight of the weekend came against UCLA, where his four goals helped the Trojans pick up a 7-6 win over their crosstown rivals while securing the tournament championship.
The tournament furthered his progress on the season, as he now leads the Trojans with 26 goals and moved up the USC career scoring list with 116 goals.
The 20-year old lefty from California also has experience on the international level, playing with the U.S. Junior National Team. Vavic was their third leading scorer at the 2009 FINA World Junior National Championships.
The Trojans are looking to win their fifth national title in a row and have started off in fine fashion, winning their first eight games ahead of a televised matchup this weekend against California. The eventual championship match will be held at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium at USC.

UCLA could not possibly be considered a university of the same caliber as USC, right? Wrong, according to the latest U.S. News and World Report National University Rankings.
This year, USC and UCLA respectively fell and rose a spot from last year’s rankings, leaving them tied for the 24th spot. While many students are angry that we have tied our rivals, we should actually be celebrating UCLA’s achievement.
USC is a prestigious institution abundant with opportunities. It also happens to cost about $40,000 per year. Despite the university’s financial aid policy, many potential students simply cannot handle this kind of economic burden.
These students, however, should still have the opportunity to pursue higher education—which is exactly why public school systems like the University of California exist. Unfortunately, countless budget cuts in recent years have made UC schools more expensive and less reputable. UCLA’s improved ranking suggests that public education is making a comeback.
I hope UCLA continues to compete with us in academic ratings. Socioeconomic status should not prevent young people from receiving the education they deserve.
Furthermore, I am happy to know that there is a school nearby that offers an academic caliber similar to our own. This allows for better collaboration between the two schools—which translates to more resources and opportunity for us—and it helps make Los Angeles a better educated city.
Education is a right, not a privilege. While our outrageously expensive tuition should certainly buy us something—small class sizes, for example—we should still celebrate when public institutions can compete with private ones.
USC’s reputation is important. But we should strive to pull other, less expensive schools to the top along with us, so that more students can achieve a high quality education. A better educated populace benefits everyone, including us private school folks, and we should be happy that UCLA is moving in that direction.

Over the weekend, the USC  women’s soccer team (3-4-1) trailed by two goals in both its matches. The Women of Troy managed to overcome one of those deficits en route to splitting its pair of games.
Youth movement · Freshman forward Jamie Fink registered an assist in two games this past weekend. Fink is one of the many freshmen USC coach Ali Khosroshahin has relied on in the early stages of the season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In its final tune-ups before  opening Pac-12 play, USC lost a close 3-2 match to No. 19 Portland at McAlister Field on Sunday and beat San Diego 3-2 in a Friday away match.
The Women of Troy got off to a tough start against Portland.
Trailing by two goals — both of which Portland’s Amanda Frisbie scored — USC managed to knot the score at two apiece with a pair of goals (61st and 67th minutes) from freshman forward Katie Johnson.
They were unable to capitalize on the momentum shift, however, and surrendered the go-ahead goal to Kaila Cameli in the 69th minute, thus losing a hard-fought match, 3-2.
“We got a lot of character. We got a lot of heart. We were very determined today,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “The young ladies are getting better every game, every training session, and it’s just a matter of time before we shore things up defensively and stop making some silly mistakes that lead to goals against us.”
USC continued to play aggressively, outshooting the Pilots 22-10, and taking four corner kicks — one more than Portland.
But because of a combination of missed opportunities and questionable calls by the officials, USC was unable to complete the comeback.
“The offense was relentless,” said sophomore goalkeeper Caroline Stanley, when asked about USC’s six straight comeback attempts from being down 2-0. “They didn’t give up on us. They really brought an energy when they stepped up onto the field. It lifted our defense’s spirits. It gave us a little bit of comfort knowing they weren’t going to give up.”
On Friday in a rematch against San Diego, the Women of Troy overcame a 2-0 deficit at halftime, scoring three goals in the second half on the road, including a last-minute go-ahead goal by senior midfielder Samantha Johnson with 15 seconds remaining.
The win ended a four-game road losing streak for the Women of Troy and a four-game losing streak to the Toreros. The loss dropped the Toreros to 3-6-0 on the season.
Despite USC playing the role of the aggressors throughout the course of the game and outshooting the Toreros 18-7, San Diego was able to jump out to an early 2-0 lead, including a header by Mariah Butera in the final minutes before the half.
USC was able to better capitalize on its scoring opportunities in the second half, however, netting goals from juniors Jordan Marada (52nd minute) and Elizabeth Eddy (86th minute) before Johnson’s game-winner. The Women of Troy also kept the Toreros from getting any more corner kick opportunities and crossing chances.
The Women of Troy open Pac-12 play next week against Washington (7-1-1)at 2 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 21. The game will be televised on Pac-12 Los Angeles.

Former Rice center Omar Oraby has officially transferred to USC, the school announced Monday.
“We are excited that Omar Oraby has joined the team and think he will fit in quickly,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said in a statemet. “His size and ability to score inside and block shots will make an immediate impact. He is a great student with a 3.7 GPA in civil engineering at Rice. He has a very bright future.”
Oraby, a 7-foot-2 junior from Cairo, Egypt, adds more depth to a frontline featuring two other seven-foot centers — junior Dewayne Dedmon and senior James Blasczyk.
Oraby was used sparingly as a freshman, appearing in 16 games for the Owls. As a sophomore, he logged 396 minutes in 34 games, setting the school’s single season blocks record with 54. He averaged six points and 3.6 rebounds while shooting 63 percent from the floor and 71 percent on free throws.
Oraby, who began taking classes Monday, will apply for a hardship waiver so he can play for the Trojans this season. Hardship waivers are typically granted for financial or medical reasons involving a player or his family. If Oraby is not granted the waiver, he will have two years of eligibility remaining, beginning with the 2013-14 season.

Make it three NorCal tournament titles in a row for the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team.
After defeating Stanford in a 10-9 overtime thriller in the semifinals, the undefeated Trojans defeated UCLA 7-6 in the title match on Sunday, holding off a late, frenetic push from the Bruins to cap a successful weekend in the Bay.
Next level · Junior driver Nikola Vavic has always been known as a prolific scorer, but has become a bonafide star in 2012, scoring 26 goals. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Junior driver Nikola Vavic led the Trojans with 12 goals during the tournament, providing a consistent scoring threat across the weekend’s four matches. Also at the driver position, sophomore Kostas Genidounias scored five goals during the weekend and senior driver Michael Rosenthal added four.
In the final, the Trojans jumped out to a 3-0 lead after the first quarter and took a 5-2 lead into halftime. Though the score indicated otherwise, the game was never really in doubt, with UCLA only scoring in the final seconds of the match to cut the deficit to one goal.
“We came out, executed our game plan, took an early lead, and that was that,” junior driver Stephen Siri said.
USC’s defense limited UCLA — last year’s national runner-up to the Trojans — to just six goals. UCLA’s top scorers weren’t able to get into a rhythm against the Trojans’ defense, as no Bruin scored multiple goals in the match. In his second start as a Trojan, junior goalie James Clark, a member of Australia’s Olympic team in London, made 11 saves.
After sophomore goalie Ely Bonilla played in the semifinal match, Jovan Vavic made the switch to Clark for the title match, although Jovan Vavic insisted not to read too much into the decision.
“Clark’s more communicative in goal, that’s one of his big strengths,” Siri said.
Nikola Vavic, the Trojans’ leading scorer so far in 2012 by a wide margin, scored four of the seven goals in the match to lead all scorers.
Though Nikola Vavic paced the Trojans all weekend, perhaps the biggest goal of the tournament came on a backhand strike from junior two-meter Jeremy Davie that gave the Trojans a narrow victory over the fourth-ranked Cardinal.
After dispatching Pomona-Pitzer 22-1 and No. 8 Pepperdine 9-4 in the first two rounds, the Trojans headed into the semifinal matchup against Stanford on Saturday expecting their greatest challenge of the season.
The Cardinal did not disappoint.
The Trojans started slow offensively, scoring just three goals in the first half as the Cardinal led 4-3 at the break.
“We had a good first half defensively,” Siri said. “But we had small communication errors, and these led to missed opportunities on the offense.”
The Cardinal scored first in the second half to take a 5-3 lead, USC’s biggest deficit of the season to date. The Trojans scored three straight goals to take a 6-5 lead, and the teams traded goals throughout the fourth quarter.
After scoring nine goals in the first three quarters, the squads combined for nine in the fourth quarter alone.
The Trojans almost won the match in regulation time, but Stanford’s B.J. Churnside scooped up the ball and fired in the equalizer with three seconds left in regulation.
Overcoming the frustration of the Cardinal’s last-second score, the Trojans held on defensively for the first half of overtime, as neither team scored.
Nineteen seconds into the second half of overtime, Davie found open space and powered the ball into the net to give the Trojans a 10-9 lead.
After that, the goal was “to not let the other team breathe,” Siri explained.
The Trojan defense clamped down on the Cardinal, and less than three minutes later their trip to the championship match was ensured.

PALO ALTO, Calif. — Ah, that looked like a USC team of yesteryear, didn’t it?
The Trojans were ranked in the top five. They were beginning Pac-12 play on the road. They were more than a touchdown favorite.
So, naturally, they laid an egg.
Yup, USC again stumbled kicking off its conference slate, this time by a final score of 21-14 to Stanford.
Counting Saturday night’s defeat, the No. 13 Trojans have now lost four of their last five Pac-12/Pac-10 road openers. In Pete Carroll-esque fashion, the team headed north to the Bay Area and left reeling after dropping a game they were pegged to win.
Gone is USC’s hope of an undefeated finish and a clear path to Miami for the BCS national championship game. Gone is Matt Barkley’s status as the Heisman Trophy frontrunner. Gone, in several respects, is the dream season.
Business, still, is very much unfinished.
A conference opener yet again proved to be rather sobering for a fan base and a team fixated on South Beach. Less than a month in, a season which once looked so promising now appears headed for some sort of metaphorical guillotine.
But at the center of the Trojans’ latest mishap was a void, and the void was context. What does this mean? What must USC and coach Lane Kiffin do in order to ascend toward the top of the national ladder?
It’s a formidable climb, yes, but hardly an impossible one. It’s September, I should point out. Nine games — or perhaps even 10, including the Pac-12 title game — remain on the schedule. And college football, after all, is too nuanced, too unpredictable to make definitive statements in week three.
Let’s slow down, please.
Here’s what we know: USC is far from an elite team at the moment.
How did Kiffin’s bunch look up on the Farm? The report card is lined in red: They were stagnant, inefficient, ineffective, distracted, unprepared and mostly overwhelmed.
Unlike past openers, the Trojans were outplayed soundly by a superior opponent — even though Stanford was without former All-American quarterback Andrew Luck under center. They were outgained in total yards 417 to 280. When it came to the running game, USC finished with 26 yards on 28 carries — 0.9 yards per attempt — despite boasting two returning 1,000-yard rushers. On third downs, they failed to convert 12 out of 13 times.
Where does the blame lie? The coaching staff, the offensive line and senior quarterback Matt Barkley all serve as a logical landing spot. But it’s inconclusive. Blame falls at the feet of nearly everyone in the aftermath of another unsettling upset.
There were questionable coaching decisions. Carrying a 14-7 lead into the third quarter, USC drove to the Stanford 13-yard line. But on fourth down, instead of trying to kick a field goal, which wouldn’t have amounted to much more than a typical extra-point attempt, Kiffin sent out the field-goal unit, along with Barkley.
The senior signal caller then attempted a fake to Alex Wood, a walk-on kicker of all people, and threw a pass to redshirt freshman fullback Soma Vainuku in the back of the end zone — a pass which was nearly caught before being punched out at the last second. Momentum, if there was any, was gone and so was the chance to build a late two-possession lead.
Similarly head scratching, in the fourth quarter, with less than a minute remaining and trailing by seven points, USC, with the ball at the Stanford 46-yard line, opted for a running play with senior tailback Curtis McNeal that yielded a loss of two yards. And the clock kept ticking.
The offensive line, which gave up eight sacks a year ago and tied for fewest in the country, has already surrendered seven through three games in 2012, including four against the Cardinal.
Not to mention, Barkley failed to throw a single touchdown pass in a game for the first time since a November 2010 loss at Oregon State when he missed the second half because of an ankle injury. It was also the first time he completed less than 50 percent of his passes in a game since his freshman season.
“I’m surprised we were held to 14 points,” Kiffin said during his post-game press conference at Stanford Stadium. “At the same time, I’m not surprised because I know what happened out there and why it happened.”
Yes, senior center Khaled Holmes was out, and so was sophomore kicker Andre Heidari — two of the Trojans’ most valued players.
But it’s hard to gloss over the obvious: The stage looked all too big for USC on Saturday night. Tasked with playing perfect, the undertaking looked too much for Kiffin, too much for Barkley and too much for just about everyone. The group looked like a team in over its head. And much like a year ago, when it fell at Arizona State by three touchdowns in late September, it’ll look to bounce back from another early-season loss.
To suggest there is plenty of season left is true. USC will have a shot to play its way back into the national title race, of course. But for now, it has to get better.
“I’d say that would be our worst offensive performance that I’ve been a part of in our nine years here, as far as physical style,” Kiffin admitted during his Sunday night teleconference with reporters.
Seemingly everything must be fixed. And for USC, which was certainly knocked in the chin by the Cardinal, it might be time to just get back to the basics.
Plenty needs mending.

PALO ALTO, Calif. — Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has amassed 29 wins during his Trojan tenure. Much to his dismay, none of those have come against Stanford.
History repeats · USC coach Lane Kiffin walks off the field following the Trojans’ defeat at Stanford Stadium. He would later lament during a Sunday media conference call that his offensive line had more missed blocking assignments than “any offensive line group we’ve ever had at any place we’ve been.” – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
In a night plagued by turnovers and inconsistency, No. 13 USC fell to the Cardinal at Stanford Stadium, 21-14. It was the fourth straight time the Trojans have lost to Stanford, making it the only conference foe Barkley has failed to beat in his career.
“They played better football than us,” Barkley said. “We were prepared. They outplayed us.”
Barkley threw for 254 yards, but also gave up a pair of interceptions and was sacked a season-high four times Saturday. As a team, the Trojans only gained 280 yards in total offense, due in large part to Stanford’s defensive front.
“That’s a great front seven,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “They’re even better than last year, giving a lot of people a lot of problems.”
The Trojans turned the ball over three times during the game and were unable to sack Stanford quarterback Josh Nunes. Though Kiffin gave credit to the Cardinal, he was emphatic in saying a lot of the damage was self-inflicted.
“If you turn the ball over like we did … we were fortunate to be ahead seven at the half,” Kiffin said.“We didn’t play with a lot of discipline today.”
Things didn’t bode well from the opening kickoff for the Trojans, as Stanford receiver Ty Montgomery ran it back 64 yards. The Trojan defense held, however, and forced the Cardinal into a 47-yard field-goal attempt that was missed by Jordan Williamson.
With about 11 minutes left in the first quarter, Barkley connected with freshman receiver Nelson Agholor on a 49-yard pass as pressure mounted. Junior tailback Silas Redd then drove it into the end zone for the game’s first points.
As was the theme Saturday, Stanford had an answer. Stanford running back Stepfan Taylor broke away for a 59-yard touchdown run later in the quarter and finished the night with 153 rushing yards. The defense was solid for the majority of the night but was unable to finish the deal.
“It’s disappointing,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “You never want to lose. I feel like we put everything we had into it [and] we just came up short.”
With a minute left in the first quarter, the Trojans went for it on fourth-and-three and converted on a pass to sophomore tight end Randall Telfer. Redd later took it in for his second score of the day on a two-yard toss play with 11 minutes in the half.
After Stanford missed another field goal, Barkley was intercepted with a little over a minute remaining in the half. Sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey returned the favor on the very next play, though, intercepting Nunes. It was his third interception of the season.
Barkley gave the Cardinal defense another gift, however, and was intercepted on the next play on what looked like an overthrow to Lee. USC’s offense never looked in sync, even later in the game.
“I thought we’d come up in the second half, up by seven … I thought we’d come out and start rolling,” Kiffin said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t.”
The strong second half Kiffin was hoping for never came, as a personal foul led to a fourth-and-17 punt. Taylor took a screen pass to the end zone at the end of the third quarter to knot the game at 14 heading into the final quarter. The Cardinal then took a 21-14 lead on a 37-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Ertz.
“I thought [Nunes] played great today,” Kiffin said. “He settled down and really made some big throws and [had] the two big runs … he looked like a veteran out there.”
Saturday’s loss is a major blow to the Trojans, who have their eyes set on a BCS title run.
But Kiffin insisted otherwise.
“It isn’t the end of the world,” he said. “We’ll get back on the plane, go back to work and get better and get ready for a home conference game next week.”
Barkley, a three-year team captain, agreed with the sentiment.
“Drop [the loss],” Barkley said. “You stick together and you go back to playing Trojan football. You have to just not put the blame on anybody and learn from your mistakes and make sure that you bounce back next week.”
The Trojans face California on Saturday at 3 p.m. The game will be available on the Pac-12 Network.
There’s no way we’ll win out now.  We looked horrible last week.  Our season is ruined, no championship and no heisman  :(  Tuck Da Frojans!
USC has not shown a number of items a top school needs to have.  1) The team plays are too predictable.  Has the team ever heard of a screen pass?  That would have stopped the defensive line instantly.   2) No field goal kicker is another hamper in the team.  Why not let the extra point kicker kick the field goals?  He has made every extra point try! 3)  Balanced run/pass offense – without one, the team is again predictable making it easier for the defense!
Please wake up and win out the rest of the season!
I thought Stanford came out with a baaaaaad attitude…like they were going to stomp someone.  And we did get stomped.  They were fast and aggressisve off both sides of the line, and hit like they meant it.  That has to be USC from here on out.  Talent is one thing…attitude another.  Without both, it’s just another game and down we go.  Having said that, I would not want to be in Cal’s shoes this weekend.  Right, guys?
You know your watching college football when a team loses a game and you say to yourself, “there goes our season”. The truth is you can’t worry about a loss. There are more important matters to attend to. There is no time to waist felling sorry about your previous game. If ever the phrase “charge the mountain” was appropriate, it’s now. The only time that loss should ever rear it’s ugly head in a locker room again is to light a fire under your ass, daily. Like that commercial says, “never let yourself feel that way again. Do that extra set, that extra lap,put in that extra time studying film”. Get with your teammates and vow to NEVER LET EACH OTHER DOWN AGAIN. Play with absolute purpose. Not just every down, but every second of every down you play. WIN FOREVER!!!!!!! FIGHT ON!!!!
All we have to do is win out…with all the ranked teams on the schedule, we will be fine. Key is this has to be a wake up call to USC, stop reading your print…always feel like you might lose…always play like you have something to prove.
