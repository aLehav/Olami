As President Donald Trump continues to solidify America’s relationship with the United Kingdom, evidenced by Prime Minister Theresa May’s visit to the White House, USC’s own President C. L. Max Nikias is also hosting powerful leaders from across the pond.
On Thursday night, former Prime Minister of the U.K. David Cameron spoke in a packed Bovard Auditorium. A select group of students, faculty and other guests, including the former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, crowded the hall to hear the politician’s thoughts on issues from globalization to fake news.
Part of the President’s Distinguished Artist and Lecture Series, the discussion gave members of the USC community the rare opportunity to hear from an influential world leader. Some of the series’ past speakers have included U.S. Presidents George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as Tom Brokaw, General Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.
The event began with an introduction from Nikias, followed by Cameron’s keynote speech and a question and answer session with students and history and accounting professor Jacob Soll, who served as the moderator. Cameron, who spent six years in office before resigning as prime minister in 2016 following a difficult battle with supporters of British withdrawal from the European Union, was recently named the new president of Alzheimer’s Research UK.
Throughout the evening, Cameron touched on many of the challenges countries around the world face as they enter the 21st century, ranging from the state of the European Union in the wake of Brexit to the emerging problem of fake news permeating the media. During his opening remarks, however, he decided to take a brighter view of global events and encouraged the audience to have a positive outlook on the future.
“First of all, let’s be optimistic,” Cameron said. “Sometimes it’s good to stand back and take a look across the decades and see what has been achieved. Almost a billion people in the world have been taken out of poverty, diseases like polio almost eradicated from the face of the earth. And democracy is still on the march.”
The benefits of globalization and the consequences of populist movements like those seen in the United Kingdom and the United States were major topics during the discussion. On these issues, Cameron expressed his belief in the merits of expanding free trade and cautioned against implementing reactionary policies that threaten global prosperity.
“The argument for staying in [the European Union] was not one of emotion, but of utility, for the influence we gain and the economic benefits of trade and cooperation,” Cameron said. “In the future we will be out of the European Union, but hopefully taking part in the things we need, such as a strong trade relationship and security. If those pursuing Brexit are for cutting Britain off from the world, I wouldn’t worry, for that is not the role of Prime Minister May’s government.”
Cameron went on to speak about the fake news that has recently made its way into the forefront of political discourse. He concluded that it is not a real cause for concern, as the success of news organizations is ultimately driven by the market.
“Fake news will damage [news agencies’] brands and reputations, so they’ll move away from it,” Cameron said.
He concluded by giving a word of advice to the students in attendance who seek to become tomorrow’s leaders, telling them to remain strong in their convictions that they can overcome the challenges of tomorrow.
“Have confidence and optimism that we are capable of cracking the problems in the world that are in front of us,” Cameron said. “We are solving some of the major diseases in the world, we have lifted a billion people out of poverty in the last 20 years, we’ve seen extraordinary developments in technology and the sciences. Do your thinking for the better, and take that into your politics.”
Students who attended the event said that they found Cameron engaging and uplifting, resonating with his sentiments on the need for a positive attitude when discussing the future.
“My favorite part was the optimism David Cameron had about him,” said Neelesh Bagrodia, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering. “Reading the news lately, a lot of people seem to be down, and I thought his comments were very reassuring.”
Ty Herdtner, a freshman in the World Bachelor of Business program, commented on Cameron’s humor and wit as a highlight of the night.
“I was honestly surprised by how light-hearted, optimistic and genuinely funny Cameron kept it,” Herdtner said. “It was refreshing to see a diplomat who wasn’t so … uptight, and was able to relate well to a younger audience.”
“Fake news will damage [news agencies’] brands and reputations, so they’ll move away from it,”
Not really.  See confirmation bias.  Rolling Stone prints lies about a rape case, loses in court, and still in business.
Where do the UVA fraternity members go to get their reputations back?
CNN repeats lies about Trump ties to Russia.  NYT the same. Wake up folks.

The man who allegedly shot and killed former USC running back Joe McKnight was charged with second-degree murder on Thursday, according to the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s office.
The suspect, Ronald Gasser, could face life in prison without the option of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. Due to the indictment, his bond was increased to $750,000.
McKnight was shot to death in December 2016 in Terrytown, Louisiana at the age of 28. The incident occurred directly after a yelling match that appeared to be the product of road rage.
The grand jury’s decision will revolve around the question of whether Gasser felt that McKnight could have been attempting to break into his car, according to legal experts. Witness Andrew Bailey says that McKnight appeared to be placating Gasser before he was shot three times. He watched McKnight stand between the two men’s cars and attempt to talk to Gasser, but never make a move that could appear aggressive.
“He never moved closer to the vehicle,” Bailey said in an interview with Outside the Lines.
When police arrived at the scene, Gasser immediately admitted to shooting the unarmed McKnight. However, he was released hours after being taken into custody, then was booked into jail four days later.
McKnight’s autopsy cleared up previous witness claims that Gasser shot McKnight again while he was on his back. There is, however, photo evidence that he stood over McKnight’s body as he died with his gun still in his hand.
The defendant’s main case, according to an Outside the Lines interview with Louisiana State University Associate Professor Ken Levy,  is that Gasser’s actions were justified under Louisiana’s Revised Statute 14:20, which allows the use of deadly force to stop someone from unlawfully entering their car.
“You have to reasonably believe that they’re trying to get in, and they present a threat of serious bodily injury or death,” Levy said.
Louisiana’s justifiable homicide status also includes a “Stand Your Ground” clause, which protects a person’s right to refuse to retreat in the face of a threat. The same provision protected Cardell Hayes, who fatally shot former NFL player Will Smith in New Orleans last year. However, both clauses remain irrelevant to this case unless proof emerges that McKnight attempted to enter Gasser’s car or challenged him to a physical altercation.
As a Trojan, McKnight lit up the Coliseum with his speedy drives. With 1,199 rushing yards and three 100-yard games in his three seasons at USC, he was often compared to Reggie Bush. 
Despite being plagued by injuries throughout college, McKnight went on to play in the NFL for three seasons with the New York Jets, and for another season with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was playing in the CFL at the time of his death.

A 2014 graduate student from the USC Marshall School of Business and a professional baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals, Bob Wheatley has integrated the importance of nutrition and healthy snacks for athletes with his bachelor’s degree in business administration. Pursuing a career as an entrepreneur, he has launched his own protein bar business, I AM Bar. 
The idea for this business struck him while he was working on a project in fall 2013 for his business entrepreneurship class, assigned by Professor Christopher Harrer.
“The project was that we had to come up with a business, a product, and my idea was making a protein bar,” Wheatley said. “For this project, we had to conduct different interviews with people and go to trade shows.”
Wheatley came up with the name I AM Bar while he was on a trip with his baseball team. He thought of several names and wanted to create a brand of selfworth that made people believe in themselves.
“I said to myself — forget the name, just think about what you want and about how you want the people who eat your bar to feel,” Wheatley said. “I want people to think positively and you have the power if you just believe.”
As an athlete, Wheatley was always interested in getting the right nutrition for himself. His base knowledge of nutrition helped him with the development of the protein bars. At the time, there was a high demand for healthier protein bars and the launch of I AM Bar became one of the solutions to that demand.
“There were plenty of bars out there, but the more research I did, the more I realized that very few of them do it well,” Wheatley said. “There are plenty of bars that taste good, but as an athlete, I care about what I put into my body, so very few of them were what I call clean bars.”
According to Wheatley, many protein bars have artificial flavors, artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohol. Wheatley decided that he wanted a clean bar not just for himself but for the other athletes, as well. He launched two flavors, apple cinnamon and chocolate peanut butter.
“We first tried [these] two recipes at home along with one for a chocolate brownie,” Wheatley said. “For [these] three flavors, we tried hundreds of recipes with different combinations. My grandma helped me with it because she is a great cook, and I am not.”
I AM Bar also launched two other flavors — chocolate brownie and mint chocolate chip — during the holiday season. The bars contain grass fed whey protein concentrate with no artificial flavors or sweeteners and are low in calories and sugar. 
Both Wheatley and his grandmother worked on the formulation of recipes. Once they came up with the recipes that they desired, they went to the food processing center at the University of Nebraska in September 2014.
“[They] offered me advice on the business side as well,” Wheatley said. “We worked with them for probably six months before we got our recipes shelf-ready and then found a manufacturer in the Los Angeles area.”
Wheatley wanted to set up a business model that allowed him to focus on both baseball and his professional career. 
While Wheatley was busy with spring training in early March, the business was gaining momentum through word-of-mouth advertising. He was committed to not overspending, and thus the company is funded only by him and his family.
“There are certain ways that you can strategize how you want to launch your business,” Wheatley said. “Sure, you can launch and buy a Super Bowl ad for $3 million, but that’s probably not the most effective method.”
According to Wheatley, his faith is a big part of who he is today, and his parents have been instrumental in teaching him the value of hard work. Wheatley is also using his business to fund his dream of playing in the major leagues.
“I am focused and I am passionate,” Wheatley said. “It has definitely taken a lot of hard work to get the business off the ground and gain some positive momentum, but I am very focused on making it a success.”
I AM Bar will be distributing free samples of their protein bars in front of the USC Bookstore from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday.

USC travels inland to face the Washington State Cougars on Saturday evening. The two teams are headed in the opposite direction at the midway point in Pac-12 play.
The Trojans (19-4, 6-4) have won three straight games including a win versus then-No. 8 UCLA and a double-digit comeback in Seattle on Wednesday night. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright returned to action for the first time since Nov. 30 and exhibited no signs of rust. Rather, he led the game in scoring, tying a career high with 23 points.
The Cougars (11-11, 4-6), meanwhile, have lost five of seven after starting conference play 2-0. Against UCLA on Wednesday, they lost by 16.
Two seniors, guard Ike Oreagbu and forward Josh Hawkinson, fuel WSU on both sides of the floor. Oreagbu averages 11.9 and 3.2 assists per game, but he is muddling through a terrific three-point shooting funk. He has but six makes in 28 attempts in conference play. He shot 1-3 from three-point range against UCLA, but managed 20 points by making 7-9 shots from inside the arc.
Hawkinson averages a double-double, 16 and 10, this season. Against UCLA, he had 15 points, nine assists and five rebounds but was beat badly on defense. UCLA forwards TJ Leaf and Thomas Welsh combined for 47 points and fatigued the Cougars, WSU Coach Ernie Kent said.
With Boatwright back in the lineup, USC offers a tandem scoring threat in the paint. He and sophomore forward Chimezie Metu billed Washington for 38 points in their first conference game together. For a scary second, it appeared as if Metu was hurt after a four-man collision in the second half, but the forward returned to the game and made a major impact.
Head coach Andy Enfield believes that Boatwright can be USC’s primary scorer, but the Trojans do not have an established secondary option. Metu and juniors Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart each average double-digit scoring, but Stewart especially tends to be a bang-or-bust scorer. Against Washington he scored five points.
Reigning Pac-12 Player of the Week Shaqquan Aaron also has a high variance in his scoring outputs. A week after dropping 23 on UCLA, he quietly scored two points at Washington. 
With Boatwright back, the whole structure of USC’s offense changes. It evolves around him, their most versatile scorer. Even their defense changed on Wednesday night, as the Trojans played some man-to-man with Boatwright in the lineup, something they have not been able to do effectively without him. 
On Saturday night, Enfield will have another chance to gauge his adapting team versus another middling Pac-12 opponent. While the Cougars’ Josh Hawkinson will test Boatwright’s fledgling stamina, the Trojan offense will challenge Washington State’s defense that allows over 80 points per game in the Pac-12.

Last September, on a damp, dreary Friday night in Salt Lake City, Clay Helton squeezed into a tiny room in the bowels of Rice-Eccles Stadium after a devastating, nail-biting loss — one that dropped his team to 1-3 — and answered questions from the media.
The head coach lamented how the win slipped away, how field conditions impacted the final score, how he thought this would be the game that would key a turnaround for USC. Instead, the Trojans were off to their worst start since 2001, and whispers arose regarding Helton’s uncertain job security.
“I’m heartbroken for [our players],” Helton said after the game.
If that moment was the nadir of Helton’s tenure, then everything since has been a meteoric rise toward the zenith, and it’s a meteor that shows no signs of slowing. He made the right gamble in starting redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, won eight straight games to finish the regular season, claimed a Rose Bowl victory in one of the most dramatic finishes in the bowl’s history and ended the season ranked No. 3 in the country. Now, a month later, Helton signed an absolute killer of a recruiting class on National Signing Day on Wednesday that fanned the flames on the three words that we’ve been dying to hear for years: USC is back.
Entering the day, the Trojans had their eyes on no fewer than eight prized recruits. They landed six of them. To put it into perspective, that’s like hitting no traffic and six of eight green lights driving down Figueroa during rush hour.
From four-star linebacker Levi Jones picking USC over both Florida and Florida State in epic, troll-like fashion (seriously, Google this) in the early morning to the afternoon commitments from Hawkins High product Joseph Lewis — ESPN’s No. 1-ranked wide receiver — and versatile four-star athlete Greg Johnson, the good news kept pouring in.
In between, the Trojans corralled three more four-star commits in defensive tackle Jay Tufele, offensive tackle Austin Jackson and tight end Josh Falo, also ranked No. 1 in his position by ESPN. And all 19 of their previous commitments stayed onboard to seal up a strong recruiting class at nearly every position, enough to push it into the top five of most national rankings by the end of the day.
It’s clear that this class — which features 14 players in ESPN’s Top 300 — will address positions of need for the Trojans. They’ll get Tufele and fellow four-star recruit Marlon Tuipulotu to shore up a defensive line weakened by the graduation of veteran defensive anchor Stevie Tu’ikolovatu and the departure of Noah Jefferson. They’ll add four offensive linemen — three of whom are four stars — to counter Zach Banner, Chad Wheeler and Damien Mama leaving the offensive front. They’ll bring in a couple of imposing wide receivers in Lewis and Randal Grimes, who will help step in the shoes of four departing “big men” — in Helton’s words — in JuJu Smith-Schuster, Darreus Rogers, De’Quan Hampton and Isaac Whitney. They’ll have an Adoree’ Jackson-like player in Johnson, who is 247Sports’ No. 1-ranked athlete in the class, able to play running back, wide receiver and defensive back. And they’ll even have a potential Sam Darnold Part II in four-star quarterback Jack Sears, who went to the same high school as Darnold in San Clemente.
The Trojans racked up so many top-notch recruits on Wednesday that it triggered my Golden State Warriors-fan guilt — you know, the tiniest bit of pity that you feel when all the best players wind up on your team. After all, the greatest game plan to beat the top players is to, well, just have them play for your team.
“They’re either going to be on your team, or you’re going to play against them,” Helton said. “The guys that we signed today I don’t want to play against. They’re talented.”
While it’s true that USC will always draw talented recruits purely from its brand name — the Trojans still managed the 13th-ranked recruiting class in 2013 despite losing scholarships because of NCAA sanctions — Helton’s impressive haul speaks to more than just the football program’s legacy.
It speaks to his ability to combine the glamour of USC with his own recruiting skills to convince talented players to don the Cardinal and Gold. It shows that he is far more than just a coach riding the coattails of a phenom quarterback to success. And it proves the benefits of tapping a long-time assistant in Helton to the head coaching position rather than hiring from outside the team -— because Helton used the relationships he developed during his time as an assistant coach to bring in this cream-of-the-crop recruiting class.
“There’s basically three ways how you win a kid’s trust. One, your character. Two, your competency in your knowledge and how you can develop them. And three, let them know that you care about them,” Helton said, pointing out that USC had followed 21 of its 23 commits over a long period of time. “That takes time. To be able to be here for a number of years and build that relationship, that definitely helps.”
With that, USC will enter spring practice with a very positive vibe and a head coach who is proving himself worthy of a prestigious position and winning over critics simply by … winning. Because when you win, people notice. But when you’re USC and you win, people really take notice — specifically, high school seniors making college decisions.
When asked if the Rose Bowl win swayed some recruits toward the Trojans, Helton didn’t disagree.
“It showed a level of consistency that I thought was important,” Helton said, “and I know it was important to the kids out there [watching] in their homes.”
Winning: It cures everything, and it makes that heartbreaking defeat on a rainy Friday night in Utah seem like a really, really long time ago.

After spending the first two weeks of the season on the road, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team will play their first game in their home pool when they host No. 15 San Diego State on Friday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 5 p.m.
The Trojans (7-0) are coming off a strong  outing at the CBU Mini Invitational in Riverside, Calif., where they outscored Concordia University and Whittier College by a combined 50-5 margin, over the weekend. Fifteen different players tallied goals over the weekend, displaying the balance that head coach Jovan Vavic has on this year’s squad.
USC is led by their pair of senior All-American drivers in Stephania Haralabidis and Ioanna Haralabidis, who are first and second on the team in scoring with 25 and 17 goals, respectively. Freshman utility Maud Megens has made an early impact for the Trojans, recording 15 goals for third-best on the team, while senior two-meter Brigitta Games and freshman driver Denise Mammolito have notched 11 goals apiece. In seven games, USC has recorded 131 goals compared to just 25 goals allowed.
Defensively, a trio of goalies have split time in the cage this season. Junior Victória Chamorro holds the top saves per game average with 12.0 saves per game and only seven total goals allowed. Sophomore Amanda Longan leads the team with 36 total saves and an 11.1 saves per game average, while freshman Holly Parker has hauled in 10 saves on the season.
The last time USC and San Diego State matched up was at the 2016 NCAA Quarterfinals last May. The Trojans won with a comfortable 12-3 score, led by junior utility Hayley McKelvey’s hat trick. USC holds the 36-9 all-time series lead and has won its last 35 games against the Aztecs.
Furthermore, Friday’s game could help Stephania move up USC’s career scoring chart. Currently sitting at No. 6 all-time with 210 career goals, Stephania needs just four goals to pass Nina Wengst (1999-02) for fifth all-time and six goals to pass Moriah Van Norman (2003-06) for fourth all-time.
Following their home opener, the Trojans will participate in a doubleheader on Saturday as part of the 2017 Whittier Invitational. USC faces off against Pomona-Pitzer at 9 a.m., followed by a game against Chapman University at 10:30 a.m.

Over the last two years, voter turnout at USC has seen a dramatic decline, indicating an alarming trend of voter disengagement among the University’s student population. After the 2016 Undergraduate Student Government election, the USG elections committee announced that students cast a mere 3,700 ballots — 39 percent less than the year before. 
Informed voting and elections with high participation rates are hallmarks of a strong democracy, not just on a national level, but also on college campuses like USC, where elections directly affect students’ day-to-day lives to a deeper extent than any large-scale federal election ever could. 
In the midst of a new political era, Americans — especially millennials — have grown particularly disenchanted with the establishment that has historically ignored their voices. Many justifiably believe they are trapped within a system that prevents them from affecting substantive change. However, failure to participate and remain informed due to these sentiments is ultimately counterproductive.
Now is not the time to sit back. Politics is an inescapable aspect of every citizen’s life, and in this sense, the decision to not vote carries just as many consequences as the decision to vote. Whether we vote for certain policies and leaders or not, they will inevitably govern our everyday lives; failing to vote will not magically remove us from the election’s impact. The choice to abstain is tantamount to allowing others to decide our fate. 
USG has historically made strides toward creating a more inclusive campus climate. But many of the aspects of daily life on campus that students complain about could be addressed through voting for presidential and Senate candidates. Students should vote for candidates they believe are receptive to their needs and willing to listen to and communicate with constituents. 
By voting in the USG election next week, students will be electing leaders with the capacity to affect undergraduate students’ physical and mental health, whether through changing dining options or advocating for better access to mental health counseling, establishing wider access to birth control at the health center or getting feminine hygiene products stocked in campus restrooms. 
The leaders we elect will make decisions regarding budgets for crucial sexual health prevention training reforms, environmental sustainability and public health programs, public safety efforts, concerts, career fairs, mentorship programs, an array of campus events and, of course, tuition hikes. They will influence policies that could determine whether or not survivors of sexual assault are delivered justice and will impact the safety of our immigrant and international peers under a presidential administration that is unprecedentedly hostile toward them.
Now more than ever in this complex political climate, complacency in our student elections is not an option. With the safety of students of ethnic minorities and other marginalized identities at stake and so many ways for our campus leaders to help and fight for policies to protect the dignity of their peers, we must meet those seeking to serve us halfway by voting and speaking up for the change we want to see. Campus elections serve as the ultimate preparation for the “real world,” as they teach students to understand the consequences of action versus inaction, of being informed versus being ignorant.
As a student publication, our role at the Daily Trojan has always been to provide unbiased reporting to the campus community to empower them to learn, make well-informed decisions and vote in their best interests. However, it is also paramount that students recognize their responsibility to educate themselves and remain informed by utilizing the resources provided to them. Voter engagement on our campus stems from a reciprocation of effort between the press and the voter, and an informed democracy cannot exist in the absence of this relationship.
At the end of the day, the first step toward having our interests represented is expressing them through our ballots. The system is flawed, but to harp on about its flaws while never taking initiative, educating oneself and participating in elections will do nothing to fix it. It is critical that USC students learn this lesson now through participating in next week’s USG election. And change always starts with a single vote.

Every man to ever hold the office of the presidency has had his own unique style of maintaining it. Each one of them, from former President George Washington to former President Barack Obama, has found a different way of filling the chair. President Donald Trump’s relatively new presidential habits — underhandedly banning religions from entering the country and hanging up on foreign leaders in moments of dissatisfaction — could be considered simply unorthodox if they weren’t so blatantly, perhaps irreversibly, destructive. Millennials, when they inherit national politics, must demand that a political culture of intellectual and rational centrism reclaim the brunt of national politics, especially the executive branch. 
The vast majority of our national policymaking is quickly becoming a constant struggle against the Tea Party, the alt-right and other radical ideologies. That is the real difference between Trump and other unusual, or perhaps relatively inexperienced, presidents — not the fact that he has adopted new methods or unpopular policies, but rather that those methods, policies and the man himself are succeeding in placating his supporters but failing to aid the American people.
Yes, he is delivering on many of his campaign promises. The swamp has been drained, whatever that must mean to the average Trumpian, by appointing the most under-qualified executive cabinet in American history (save for  James ‘Mad Dog’ Maddis and maybe, hopefully, ExxonMobil CEO  Rex Tillerson); the “scary” Muslims and (maybe, from the looks of proposed legislation) the ungodly gays will be purged from society. If you voted for Trump because you hated some of your fellow Americans, great! They’re suffering. Just as Trump is (still) constantly tweeting, you won. 
It is not the platform nor the ideology that stands in danger at this moment — it is the presidency that is failing. The problem with Trump’s presidency is not that he is failing to deliver on his promises — it is that his promises are in direct opposition to what is good for the nation itself. The wishes of his zealots have overshadowed the needs of the nation. 
Every president has sought to please the constituency that elected him. But Trump searches not for progressive or conservative solutions to the needs of Americans, but rather another high-five and the universal acceptance of his fantasy that he did, in fact, win the popular vote. Health care, women’s rights, environmental realities and freedom of speech and religion are subsumed to the ideological crusade of the far-right to reclaim their nation, a white Christian America that only ever existed through oppression. The presidency was once for the people, not just for whoever elected it. 
Neither former Presidents Ronald Reagan nor John F. Kennedy sought to appease their constituents by abusing other Americans. The most sickening part of the contemporary administration is that it is doing exactly what it promised — and that following up on promises means taking partisan politics to an entirely new level of “us versus them” volatility. Suddenly, our government is not holding itself to a higher standard of public service. Our government is not seeking to serve at all, even while pursuing of its ideological goals. Instead, it has adopted a blanket bullying method to give undereducated and hateful supporter groups a moment of feel-good triumph — a touchdown in a football game. This Republican president has none of the respect for the presidency that characterized men like Dwight Eisenhower, Reagan or even George H.W. Bush. 
Many tout the noble deed of seeking discourse with the other side, that the achievement of progress may only be sought through bipartisan conversation. But remember: There is no purpose of discussion between two parties who do not have the same common goal. Trump and his supporters have made it clear that they do not seek the best interests of all Americans, but rather the abuse and expulsion of those they disdain. It is not an ideology of policy or administration, but one of hatred. 
There can be no negotiation with radical reactionaries who seek the abolition of civil rights, of a stable economy and of a sustainable physical environment. It is an ideology of destruction. Radical reactionaries will not respect your noble choice to give them a seat at the table, because they do not believe in the table at all. If we want to reclaim bipartisanship in U.S. politics, it will not mean negotiating with fascists. It will require centrists on both sides of the aisle to demand their parties maintain a conservative or progressive ideology in order to serve all Americans — and stop proliferating popular hatred.

The cast and crew of the Aeneid Theatre Company presented their first play of the spring semester on Thursday — a well-executed, captivating production of The Miser, written by French playwright Molière in the late 17th century. 
The ATC is a student-run theater group dedicated to producing non-musical plays at USC and has frequently dazzled the campus community with its diverse productions and ambitious projects, such as EQUUS during the fall semester and When the Rain Stops Falling last spring.
 The Miser is no exception; it is a challenging selection for these student performers. Capturing the essence of a play written nearly 500 years ago and in another language requires skill, attention to detail and, most importantly, a willingness to learn an entirely new culture to depict onstage. 
Despite these challenges, the artists of the ATC managed to put on an impressive production, transporting the audience into traditional, aristocratic French society. It is evident that the group spent countless hours mastering their roles, perfecting the set design and molding a believable portrayal of foreign characters: The overall presentation was truly stunning.
 The Miser is one of Molière’s most acclaimed comedies, originally featuring the playwright himself as the play’s protagonist, Harpagon. Manny Spero stars as Harpagon, the miser, who buried his fortune in his garden and refuses to spend it on his children, Élise (Anna Couvrette) and Cleanté (Ido Gal). Instead, the miser attempts to marry them off to wealthier families, as he searches for a younger wife for himself.
This widely successful production can be attributed not only to the cast’s talent and prowess, but also to the effectiveness of the show’s director, Jack McCarthy. His ability to harness the individual talents of his cast members and to recreate an intricate story is sophisticated, especially for a director with such little classical experience. McCarthy said that this production is only his second time directing a classical piece, but he was anything but a novice.
To create an authentic production, McCarthy encouraged his actors to actively examine their characters. He wanted the cast to fully grasp their characters’ intentions, needs and true motivations — a process that translated beautifully onto the stage.
“The cast and I spent many rehearsals analyzing the text, arguing about this old play’s relevant meaning,” McCarthy said. “We searched for that universal issue each character struggled with, and stumbled upon the need for security — not just financially, but emotionally, mentally and even spiritually.”
Such extensive research and exploration proved to be worthwhile, as the production offered a nuanced and realistic glimpse of the 17th century social landscape. However, one of the most enjoyable aspects of the play was not based in the decor, the talent or the precision. Rather, the chemistry among the cast members was undeniable, a quality that is a testament to a gifted director like McCarthy.
“It is rare for a director to be saddled with a cast so passionate, insightful and open as this one,” McCarthy said. “I partook in meaningful and very provoking discussions with the cast and crew of The Miser which enhanced both the direction of our show and my own worldview.”
This production demonstrates how magical it can be to witness apt execution of classic works such as The Miser, a play that should certainly be preserved throughout the ages. The Miser was presented in the Comedia dell’Arte style of Italian theater, which emphasizes specific character tropes to reveal greater flaws and themes in the characters’ personalities. The ATC’s student-led production was quite the success — stellar acting, brilliant directing and masterful translation are but a few of the characteristics of  the group’s poignant portrayal.
“It has been such a pleasure working with such an amazing and dedicated cast,” Ashley Busenlener, the show’s assistant director, said. “The way they’ve taken to the physical Commedia dell’ Arte is incredible and has produced a really enjoyable and funny show.” 
There will be five more performances over the coming weekend at USC’s Massman Theatre. Five dollar donations are requested at the door.

Between stints as a serious girlfriend, I was a serial ghoster. In my mind, I owed nothing to boys who I had never met. And so often all they got from me was just that: nothing.
 When I first got Tinder, I had just exited a year-and-a-half relationship. I was not ready for dating, but I was practically giddy about dating apps. I got a couple hundred matches pretty quickly but only sustained one long conversation. His name was Dave, and he was a British military vet spending a summer in the United States as a camp counselor. We talked for over a week, and when he finally got to my city, he kept asking to meet up. He started to exhaust me. So I ignored all of his texts, and when he called, my friend Hailey and I watched my phone buzz on the table in silence.
 That was the first time I disappeared without an explanation. The last time I ghosted was two weeks into my current relationship. The timing sounds murky, but the guy and I had made plans to meet up when he got back from a business trip. We made the plans two days after I met my boyfriend; by the time he was back, it was official. But I didn’t explain any of that — I just left the message in my inbox.
 I realized I regretted behaving this way online when I was interviewed for a podcast. The concept was a roundtable discussion about the perspectives on dating app behavior, and I started joking around about my old habits. All of this was true.
 “If a guy sent a message I didn’t like, I’d ghost him.”
 “If he sends me something that I can’t think of an answer to, I’m done responding.”
 “If the first date isn’t good, you don’t have a responsibility to text them. There isn’t a need for an explanation until you’ve met twice after meeting on the internet.”
 Then, the guy across the table shared his opinions about how girls behave online. And, as weird as it sounds, it was the first time I’d heard a straight guy talk about dating apps in earnest. And I realized he was genuinely affected, albeit not deeply, when someone stopped giving him the time of day. So I thought about the unsaved numbers in my phone and the conversations that ended with nothing. I thought, especially, about the really sweet, good-looking boy — a graduate student at USC — who had asked for a date after a trip only to be purposefully ignored.
 I thought about the four dates I had planned for the weekend I met my boyfriend. My date with him was the second out of four, and I don’t think I offered any explanations to the other guys. The third date was the one I had been most looking forward to. When I went back to delete my Bumble, I realized the guy from the fourth date had messaged me once more.
 Sometimes, in my head I imagine redownloading Bumble, just for five minutes, to send politely worded explanations to those who I interacted with most regretfully. Then I remind myself, of course, that I deleted my account, that these people probably don’t remember me and that — in general — that would be a really weird thing to do. I also remember that some of the guys treated me unfavorably too.
 Many asked me out and never followed through.
 One guy I didn’t respond to for a day sent me another message asking me if I was really dull enough to need a direct question to keep a conversation going. When I didn’t respond to that (it’s not ghosting if he was being rude), he passive-aggressively assured me that we wouldn’t be going on a date.
 One guy, at the texting phase, couldn’t come up with any plans,  so he thought we should meet at his house. I had certain rules — never meet past dark, always meet in public, don’t go over to someone’s place until you’ve met them at least twice — and made it clear to him that I wouldn’t be visiting him. He proceeded to send me a screen-grab of an Instagram rant about “girls these days” and how they assume all any guy wants is sex, especially when guys invite girls over to their place. “No thank you, internet stranger,” I thought. I did not ghost him. I told him quite unapologetically that he was rude.
 Of course, none of the behavior above excuses my petty irresponsibility on dating apps. I don’t believe I caused any of these guys any significant emotional distress by simply not responding to them. But I recognize now that my habits were disrespectful and lazy. And although the bizarre boys I described above were not always lazy, they were disrespectful too. There’s a culture of casual ambivalence about the person on the other side of the screen — almost as if that person doesn’t exist. At that podcast, however, when I sat across the interview table from the personified, anonymous, straight guy on Bumble, I snapped out of that point of view.
 Now, I’m firmly anti-ghosting. If the stories above show anything, I hope they show my tiny call to action. Dear reader, do better than me.

One of the many executive orders signed by President Donald Trump during his first week in office: a global “gag” rule, sometimes called the Mexico City policy, that denies US aid to any non-governmental organization that provides abortion services for women. 
The origins of the rule date back to the Reagan era, where the then-president’s administration signed the policy into effect based on the grounds that “the United States does not consider abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs and will no longer contribute to those of which it is a part.” Since then, the rule has been repealed by every Democratic president and reinstated by Republican presidents.
The most jarring announcement? Trump’s rule had an added bonus — whereas previously the policy had cut off funds from only USAID and the State Department, it has now been extended to include aid from any U.S. department or agency. Instead of impacting $600 million in aid, the policy now has the potential to affect $9.5 billion that could have promoted women’s reproductive health all around the globe.
The consensus is clear: Statistics have shown the gag rule has devastating effects for women in developing countries, who often rely on health clinics funded by overseas aid for a range of reproductive health needs. The repercussions of the policy extend far beyond limiting access to abortions. NGOs in developing countries allocate the aid to a wide range of services, including providing contraceptives, HIV/AIDS treatments, STD testing, and Ebola, malaria and Zika prevention. In addition, women who lose access to abortions provided by these clinics will resort to dangerous and life-threatening methods of abortions, when they are given no other choice.
These clinics that receive U.S. aid in other countries have a choice: accept the funds and cut their abortion services, or decline the funds and maintain their right to give women abortions. Clinics in two countries in particular, Ethiopia and Kenya, were hard-hit by the 2001 reinstatement of the global gag rule when they declined the aid in order to keep their abortion services open. In Kenya, the nation’s two largest reproductive health providers were forced close multiple health clinics across the country to make up for their loss in funding, affecting access to not only safe abortions, but also to contraceptive education and community resources for HIV/AIDS. When put into effect, the gag rule acts counterproductively to America’s proclaimed goal of promoting maternal/child health and preventing HIV/AIDS worldwide. In Ethiopia, large clinics had to stop providing free contraceptives to its community members. With the cuts in funding, other birth control measures for women also became severely limited.
Millions of women across the globe lack access to sexual education and contraceptives. When it comes to teenage girls who aren’t provided the knowledge necessary to prevent early pregnancies and are vulnerable to child marriages and unsafe abortions, the work that is done by international health organizations is vital to the advancements of female rights and education in developing countries. Avoiding STIs and unwanted pregnancies allows girls to stay in school longer, opening up a world of opportunity .
The bottom line: Trump’s executive order is a chokehold on the progress being made for women’s health worldwide.

The Undergraduate Student Government presidential debate took place on Wednesday night. The six candidates, running on three tickets for president and vice president, respectively, are Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan, Rachel Udabe and Rebecca Harbeck and Daniel Million and Tim Vorhoff. They answered live questions — submitted earlier to USC Annenberg Media’s website — from students.
Udabe, a junior majoring in political science and policy, planning and development, and Harbeck, a sophomore studying economics and sociology, characterized their campaign with the slogan “Unite, Strengthen and Connect.” Dunn, a junior majoring in political science and earning his master’s in public policy, and Monahan, a junior majoring in business administration, operate on the slogan “Achieve More.” Million, a junior majoring in neuroscience and Vorhoff, a sophomore majoring in business, adopted the slogan “Make Your Voices Heard.” 
The first issue the candidates addressed was the tuition hike of nearly $2,000 that the university administration introduced last year. Udabe talked about her plans to implement an online platform to inform students of undergraduate finances. Dunn aims to lower the cost of mandatory fees. 
“Tuition has to be discussed in terms of transparency and affordability,” Dunn said. “We’ve asked the administration to release information that clearly explains why the increases were happening on a yearly basis. Additionally, we’ve made great progress in trying to reduce fees for the coming years.” 
Vorhoff mentioned that though he doesn’t have an exact solution to improve transparency, the best approach would be to talk with the administration to understand tuition hikes. 
Another issue brought to the candidates’ attention was the treatment of minority groups. One student asked how the candidates will be expanding campus inclusivity for Muslims. 
“We want to push administration to make a stronger statement about vulnerable communities,” Dunn said, referencing President Donald Trump’s recent immigration executive order. 
Million, on the other hand, said he wants to ensure that USC can be a sanctuary campus, and meet with cultural assemblies and resource centers. Udabe’s tactic includes understanding the needs of all students and meeting with as many people as possible. 
Another student-submitted question addressed how the candidates would treat sexual assault differently than previous USG leaders. All candidates emphasized the need for more training.  Dunn’s plans include to apply wider sexual assault prevention training — which Greek organizations on campus have started implementing — and possibly assign sexual assault representatives for campus organizations who will act as liaisons between USG and its organizations. Vorhoff stated that students should be given greater bystander training. Harbeck placed an emphasis on RSVP training.
”We need to build a culture of respect and responsibility,” Harbeck said. 
After addressing more student questions concerning campus issues, candidates wrapped up the town-hall style debate with closing statements. Million stated that his priority is to improve diversity and inclusion on campus, mentioning that he has felt excluded on campus before. If elected, Million would like to meet with different groups on campus.
“We definitely want to take more action on social issues and get more students involved on this campus,” Million said.
Udabe recognized that she and Harbeck lacked USG experience, but stated that that should not hinder students from voting for their ticket.
“We are leaders who are willing to fight for you,” Udabe said. “You deserve better from your student leaders and you deserve a seat at the table.”
Dunn stressed that he and Morgan’s combined experience working in USG would make them the best candidates for this election.
“We can’t reiterate enough how important experience is to be a successful president and vice president,” Dunn said. “Morgan and I will continue moving forward and accomplish the things we’ve started working on.”

When Jacob Broussard heard the news on Jan. 24, he was outraged. That day, President Donald Trump gave the go-ahead for two controversial oil pipelines — Dakota Access and Keystone XL. 
Broussard, a junior majoring in choral music, is a member of the Native American Student Union, a group that brings together students of Native descent on campus. These students, Broussard said, feel the impact of Trump’s order more strongly than others because Native Americans stand to lose the most if these pipelines are built.
“The executive order is a blatant disregard for the sacred land of Native peoples as well as the health of thousands of United States citizens,” Broussard said. “It’s also a violation of fundamental rights.”
Broussard is not alone — students have been speaking out in opposition to the pipelines, most notably in September when members of the Native American Student Union, Young Democratic Socialists and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation hosted a rally to protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Though former President Barack Obama directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reevaluate the Dakota Access Pipeline in November and denied construction permits to the Keystone XL Pipeline, Trump’s order has reopened the debate — and students are divided over whether these pipelines should be built.
Furthermore, Broussard worries that the process of transferring this crude oil and its potential for leakage could be detrimental to the environment and surrounding communities. The process used by these pipelines is thought by scientists to increase carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and potentially contaminate large bodies of water like the Mississippi River and drinking water sources for Native Americans, deteriorate the integrity of tribal land and disturb sensitive local habitats, according to Business Insider.
Trump, however, approves of the construction of the pipelines, saying they will create 28,000 jobs and provide opportunity for construction of the pipes in the United States when he signed the executive order on the 24th, as opposed to the pipes being made in other countries, according to NPR. The pipelines spurred several months of protests from environmentalists, Native Americans, human rights activists and those who stood in solidarity with these groups. Large numbers of protestors occupied for months the prospective pipeline route, resulting in various arrests and tension involving law enforcement. Students are split on the morality, cost-benefit analysis and feasibility of the plan to implement the pipelines.
Malcolm Rakshan, a freshman majoring in political science and a member of the USC College Republicans, stands behind the construction of these pipelines.
“Trump made the common sense decision to move forward with the pipeline,” Rakshan said. “Going with the theme of America First, Trump established a precedent to focus on creating jobs through developing public works and improving infrastructure.”
The pipelines plan to navigate through mostly the Midwest, some states also belonging to America’s Rust Belt. This same region won Trump the election — with political scientists arguing that people from these states who were unemployed felt empowered by Trump’s message to create more jobs for them. In and near the Rust Belt region, the pipeline acts as the opportunity for Trump to provide employment for these individuals. But Broussard said this is not a justification.
“No number of jobs is worth risking thousands of lives,” Broussard said. “No amount of oil is worth risking our environment. No potential profits are worth the attempted degradation of a strong and resilient people.”
Though the current administration has green-lighted the construction of these pipelines, Broussard said they will continue to work against the executive order. 
“The Native American community will continue to fight for change,” Broussard said. “We will not be silent nor will we ever give up. We still exist.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misquoted Malcolm Rakshan. It has now been updated with what he actually said. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
To all the self-entitled people who want to virtue signal – but also live in a society that provides all the comforts if it is run by fossil fuels – go take a long look at your hypocritical self. People think computers, electricity and their iPhones run on uniforn pixie dust and do not realize even their Prius need power plants run on oil to provide electricity to charge their batteries. If you really want to live up to your paper thin convictions – stop using electricity.

Frederick Ryan Jr., CEO of The Washington Post and former top aide to President Ronald Reagan, joined the USC Board of Trustees on Wednesday. Ryan, who graduated from USC with a double major in political science and speech communication in 1977 and  earned a juris doctor three years later, was elected to the board after a career in journalism and politics.
Ryan worked as an attorney before serving in the White House from 1982 to 1989. Beginning in 1995, he served as president of Allbritton Communications, a group of cable television stations. Ryan then co-founded Politico, a Pulitzer Prize-winning political journalism company that focuses on Washington, D.C. He served as CEO of Politico until 2014, when he was appointed CEO of The Washington Post. Ryan was selected by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who acquired the publication in 2013. 
“Fred Ryan is an extraordinary media entrepreneur, political adviser and public servant, having distinguished himself in both the White House and in the communications world,” said President C. L. Max Nikias to USC News. “In recent decades, Mr. Ryan has drawn tremendous admiration for boldly redefining the role of media and for reimagining political journalism. His vast experience and exceptional vision will certainly benefit our board in profound ways.”
Throughout his career, Ryan has stayed involved with USC, serving on the board of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and was awarded with the USC Alumni Association’s Alumni Merit Award in 2005. 
“When I first came to D.C., USC was certainly known and respected, but in the last few years, its presence here and the appreciation and admiration for what the University does has grown enormously,” Ryan said to USC News. “As a proud Trojan, that’s been great to see.”

Director of the Political Science and International Relations  Ph.D. program Christian Grose and USC Gould School of Law Assistant Professor Abby Wood explored the effect of government transparency on constituents in a discussion held on Wednesday in the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
According to Grose and Wood’s theory, campaign finance disclosures reveal information that leads voters to reevaluate the traits of each candidate, affecting voter behavior. Backed by the Federal Election Commission and the Bedrosian Grant, the professors tested their theory to show that audits affected not only voter opinion but also legislative behavior. Providing audits also contributed to “cleaner legislators.”
Grose and Wood also found that increased transparency of candidates reduced voter margins. In 1978, a randomized audit sponsored by the FEC was conducted across U.S. House of Representative and Senate officials, and election activity for incumbents was analyzed. The most common violations were lack of disclosure, hiding records, illegal contributions and excessive contributions and misstatements. 
“Transparency leads to better voter performance,” Grose said. “The direct effect of audit on legislator votes shares suggests those who were audited did worse in the following election.” 
However, legislators who had violations did significantly worse than those who did not have audit violations. 
The audits conducted also subsequently affected the behavior of the legislator. Grose and Wood’s research indicated that after the audit, legislators would take more trips back to their home district in order to campaign to the constituents more often. 
“If they were audited, they were more likely to travel back to their district and start hustling more in their district for votes and they are doing it in anticipation of being punished electorally,” Wood said. 
In the experiment, there was an increase in retirement and resignation for incumbents who were audited. Incumbents that did not have violations were 5 percent more likely to retire or resign. In contrast, campaign finance violators were 10 percent more likely to retire or resign. 
Grose and Wood concluded that through the financial audit of legislators, voters could make more informed decisions about the candidates they vote for which would result in better candidates taking the legislative seat. 
“Right now, we are seeing that transparency and accountability in governance in public institutions is very important, and it’s a way to get our students and public informed about what’s going on,” said Aubrey Hicks, executive director of the Bedrosian Center said.

Head coach Clay Helton didn’t sleep well on Tuesday night.
The next morning, he knew, was the final test of his first full year as the head coach of the Trojan football team. There’s a long journey between winning a Rose Bowl and rebuilding the USC football dynasty. For Helton, Wednesday was the first step.
After a full day of signing, his fears were put to rest, as his program roped in one of the strongest recruiting classes in the nations. The Trojans ultimately earned the top recruiting class in the Pac-12 and the No. 4 class in the nation with two five-star commits, 12 four-star commits, 10 three-star commits and one two-star commit. 
The group answers questions for both the offensive and defensive lines, while also filling in skills positions at wide receiver and running back.
“You’re going after the best of the best, and when you do that, you’re seeing a lot of kids make decisions very late,” Helton said. “We had six young men that we were after today, and we’ve added very well, and won those battles. The guys that we signed today I don’t want to play against. They’re talented.”
Both of the Trojans’ five-star recruits will fill holes the offensive side of the team. Wide receiver Joseph Lewis is an L.A. native who received offers from over 30 Division I teams. Ranked first in his position, Lewis selected USC over his final options of Nebraska and Oregon. 
His decision marked the third time in the past 10 years that USC signed the top wide receiver recruit. Lewis will be immediately necessary to fill the hole that wide receivers JuJu Smith- Schuster and Darreus Rogers left behind.
Running back Stephen Carr will join his fellow five-star recruit in the offensive rotation. Carr committed to USC almost two years ago, but after visiting UCLA earlier this year, his loyalties raised the concern of many fans. When Carr — who ranked No. 3 overall in his position — appeared at Fontana Summit High’s signing ceremony with multiple USC banners in tow, Trojan fans breathed a collective sigh of relief.
Similar to Lewis, Carr fills a gap left in the offense by the graduation of running back Justin Davis. But Davis spent weeks of the past season on the sidelines nursing an ankle sprain, while sophomore Ronald Jones II took over at the head of the rushing attack. With Carr added to the mix, the Trojans will feature an explosive attack both on the ground and in the air.
“They’re going to be given the opportunity to compete right now,” Helton said. “We expect them to do great things, whether that’s day one or day 101.”
And those are only the five-star recruits. The Trojans pulled a wealth of four-star commitments, earning a total of 12 signatures from the class. 
Included in those signatures was outside linebacker Levi Jones, whose signing ceremony immediately earned national attention.
Jenny Chung | Daily Trojan
In the middle of the ESPNU broadcast of his ceremony, Jones stood to announce his decision, unzipping a black hoodie to reveal a bright blue Florida shirt. As applause rose from the crowd, Jones shook his head, laughing and muttering, “Y’all better chill.”
The crowd immediately let out cries of surprise as Jones stripped off the Florida shirt to reveal a Florida State tee, which he removed to reveal a cardinal and gold Trojans shirt. He tugged on a USC hat, said his first “fight on” and immediately began trending on Twitter.
The announcement would’ve given any head coach panic, Helton joked, if Jones hadn’t texted him just before the ceremony started.
“Levi saved me from a heart attack today,” Helton said. “Right prior to him going on TV, he texted me and said, ‘Coach, I’m a Trojan.’ Thank God he texted me, I would’ve had a heart attack.”
Joining Jones on defense are safeties Bubba Bolden and Isaiah Pola-Mao, outside linebacker Hunter Echols and defensive tackles Jay Tufele and Marlon Tuipulotu. 
Bolden committed to USC during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, where he made his presence known by leaping a center to kick the ball out of the opposing kicker’s hands and return it for a touchdown.
He is joined by Pola-Mao, a nephew of NFL safety and two-time Super Bowl champion Troy Polamalu. The pair is ranked No. 11 and No. 15 respectively, bringing high-power energy to the Trojan secondary.
With a No. 10 position ranking, USC beat out both Alabama and Oklahoma to claim Echols back in August. But the addition of Tuipulotu came as a surprise when he ditched his commitment to Washington to enroll early at USC last Monday. 
The announcement that Tufele — the top-ranked player out of Utah — chose the Trojans rounded out a defensive line that was in desperate need of reinforcement. Tufele will likely replace fellow Utah native Stevie Tu’ikolovatu, who ended his single transfer season with the Trojans as the Rose Bowl defensive MVP.
Tight end Josh Falo, quarterback Jack Sears, offensive tackles Austin Jackson and Alijah Vera-Tucker and center Brett Neilson fill out the offensive side of the ball. Sears played alongside redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold at San Clemente High, while Falo will bring his No. 1-ranked talent to a tight end corps that found success throughout last season.
The additions of Jackson, Vera-Tucker and Neilson were a success for the Trojans, whose offensive line thinned out with the graduation of Zach Banner and Chad Wheeler. Jackson was the blue-chip pick of the group, and will follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, Melvin, who played offensive line for the Trojans in the 1970s.
And the three-star commits won’t be far behind. Wide receiver Randal Grimes and tight end Erik Krommenhoek will join Lewis as a target for Darnold, while offensive tackle Andrew Vorhees and offensive lineman Jalen McKenzie will provide a fortified pocket for the young quarterback.
Shoring up the defense are linebackers Juliano Falaniko and Tayler Katoa, cornerback Jay Godfrey, defensive line Jacob Lichtenstein and defensive tackle Brandon Pili. The group continues to add depth to an area that left Trojan fans nervous after the end of last year’s season.
Rounding out the group is long snapper Damon Johnson, a two-star recruit simply due to his position. If Trojan fans are lucky, Helton said, this will be the last time they hear his name.
Those 23 players will be expected to join the competition for starting positions the second they arrive in Los Angeles. For a moment, Helton celebrated the success of his first full year of recruitment. But he isn’t one to rest for very long.
“That’s what I love about this place,” Helton said. “It’s always been that way. It’s been guys who come up here and never shy away from the competition. They know from day one that the best player’s going to play. It doesn’t matter if you’re a freshman or a senior. You know that you’re going to come to USC and compete in a hurry.”
Yesterday, the new class of Trojans made themselves heard. Now, it’s time to prepare for a new season and new expectations.

You never know what you have until it’s gone. The Trojans are sure glad to have their most prized asset back on the floor performing for them.
USC welcomed back sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright with open arms Wednesday night, as he led the winning charge for the Trojans against Washington (9-13, 2-8) on the road. Southern California defeated the Huskies by a final score of 82-74.
Boatwright scored 16 of his game-high 23 points Wednesday in the second half as the Trojans overcame a double-digit halftime deficit to pick up their third consecutive conference victory.
Boatwright, who suffered an MCL injury on Nov. 30 against San Diego, had been inactive for USC the past nine weeks of play. He immediately contributed upon returning to the lineup Wednesday, hitting his first three shot attempts from the field against the Huskies. Overall, Boatwright made 7-of-10 shots from the field in the game.
A 13-2 run from Southern California (19-4, 6-4) late in the second half gave the Trojans a 67-66 lead they would not relinquish over the final 4:38 of regulation. Overall, USC finished the game by outscoring the Huskies 27-13 over the final nine minutes of play Wednesday.
Washington made a scoring charge late in the game, as the Huskies pulled within a point of the Trojans with under two minutes remaining after a three-pointer from sophomore guard Matisse Thybulle.
USC responded with a made hook shot from sophomore forward Chimezie Metu that put the Trojans ahead by three with 1:30 in regulation.
A pair of free throws from Boatwright put the Trojans ahead by five with just 52 seconds remaining; this cut Washington’s late comeback effort short.
Boatwright scored four points in the final four minutes of regulation to diffuse Washington’s scoring runs.
As a team, USC made five of its last six field goal attempts to close out the game. At the same time, Washington missed 13 of its last 15 shots (13.3 field goal percentage) to finish the contest.
Washington finished the first half on a 15-0 run that put the Huskies ahead of USC, 37-27, at the break. The Trojans responded with a 13-4 run to open the second half; they would outscore Washington in the final half of play, 55-37, en route to the victory.
USC was able to erupt offensively in the second half after going scoreless over the final five minutes of the opening half.
The Trojans shot efficiently from the field to conclude the game, hitting 17 of their 25 shots (68 percent) to conclude the game. From long range, USC was 4-for-7 from beyond the arc in the second half.
Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton put together another complete performance on the road. Melton finished the game with 16 points (6-of-11 shooting), seven rebounds and six assists. Defensively, Melton was a force against Washington, as he recorded six total steals.
In a losing effort, Washington’s standout freshman guard Markelle Fultz finished with 20 points, six assists and five rebounds. 
Boatwright (23 points scored), Melton (16), Metu (15) and junior guard Jordan McLaughlin (13) were the four double-digit scorers for the Trojans on Wednesday.
Behind Boatwright’s 23 points off the bench, USC’s reserves outscored Washington’s bench, 26-1, in the win. 
USC shot 20-of-27 (74 percent) from the free throw line; Washington shot only 9-of-13 (69 percent) from the stripe.
Metu finished with 15 points scored (6-of-13 shooting) and a team-high eigh rebounds against the Huskies. He scored 13 of his points Wednesday in the second half. Three rim-rattling dunks from Metu in the final half of play gave the Trojans momentum and sparked their comeback effort.
Washington sophomore forward Noah Dickerson finished Wednesday’s game with 17 points and nine rebounds.
Coming off of a 12-steal performance against UCLA last Wednesday, the Trojans were able to create 14 steals defensively against the Huskies.
With the victory, USC improves to 6-4 in Pac-12 play; it trails conference leading Arizona (20-2, 9-0) in the standings by four games.
After falling to the Trojans, the Huskies are now on a four-game losing streak.
The Trojans will remain in the state of Washington for their next game. USC will take a trip to Pullman, Washington to take on Washington State (11-11, 4-6) Saturday.

It’s only three days till Super Bowl Sunday — one of the best events on the face of the earth and the one day you don’t mind sitting through 10 minutes of ads to watch five minutes of football. And with the New England Patriots playing in the Big Game once again, it’s also time for 99 percent of the NFL’s fan base to rip on one Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr.
As someone who lived outside of the United States until attending high school in New England, it truly shocked me to see the amount of vitriol people hurled at Brady and Bill Belichick when I arrived in Los Angeles. Sure, I knew they wouldn’t be the borderline deities they are inside Patriots Nation (I had a friend who seriously considered swapping his presidential vote from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump after Belichick unofficially endorsed the latter), but I at least expected begrudging respect — the same kind you are forced to give to the Golden State Warriors or any other organization that breaks the sport because it’s just too damn good. Alas, all I hear outside of New England are calls of “cheater” and constant reminders of Spygate and Deflategate.
I feel sorry for those who are too blinded by hate to appreciate Brady’s play. The fact is that if the Patriots emerge victorious on Sunday, Brady will be the greatest quarterback in football history (if he isn’t already). No ifs, ands or buts. By almost every metric, be it passing stats or rings or MVP awards, Brady will have surpassed the likes of Joe Montana and John Elway. He’s already played in the most Super Bowls ever, with two undeserved flukes as losses — and this is coming from a Giants fan who deliriously cheered on Eli Manning in the heart of Patriots territory in 2012. If Asante Samuel doesn’t drop a gimme interception late in Super Bowl XLII, if either Wes Welker or Aaron Hernandez doesn’t drop a game-clinching first down in Super Bowl XLVI, we’d be watching Brady play for his seventh championship.
Yet people remain hung up on crucifying the quarterback for … what, exactly? Deflating footballs (allegedly)? His friendship with President Trump? There have been far too many heinous offenses committed by NFL players over the years, ranging from domestic violence to straight-up murder, and somehow Brady, a man who hasn’t been the culprit in any of those crimes, remains one of the most hated players in the league. 
Let’s just say that Brady was guilty to the maximum extent in all Patriot controversies during his career for the sake of argument. Let’s say he conspired with the referees to get the ball back in 2001’s Tuck Rule Game; let’s say he masterminded Spygate in 2007 with Belichick and then decided not to send the tapes to the NFL in the subsequent investigation; let’s say he deflated New England’s footballs to his advantage before the 2015 AFC Championship Game.
Forgetting that the first two hypotheticals are laughably far-fetched, where would this leave Brady’s legacy? He’d be a serial cheater — which isn’t good — but even then, would that mean he deserves more criticism than, say, Peyton Manning? Manning was a universally adored figure throughout his career, even though he was accused of sexually harassing a trainer while playing college football at Tennessee and dealt with allegations of human growth hormone use in the last year of his career. What about rising Kansas City superstar Tyreek Hill, who has electrified the NFL after getting expelled from Oklahoma State for choking his pregnant girlfriend?
Say what you want about Brady’s alleged on-field transgressions, but at least they were indeed on the field. And when you restrict the conversation to the gridiron, none of Brady’s controversies did anything to hurt his football legacy: The Tuck Rule was a bad rule that was correctly called (New England had actually fallen victim to it earlier that season against the New York Jets), the Patriots lost in the 2008 Super Bowl and Deflategate was a moot point in a 45-7 blowout. Not to mention that Brady’s story is a sports-movie-like underdog story, rising from a scrawny late-round pick and failed baseball prospect to the greatest quarterback of all time. Seriously, what is there to hate about this dude?
Perhaps it all boils down to jealousy. To borrow a Trumpism, Brady is winning, winning, winning — winning so much that people are tired of him winning. He has the best coach, the best endorsement deals and the best family. We can’t relate to his rocket arm, transcendent football IQ, dashing looks or supermodel wife.
But I urge all haters to reconsider their views: Brady isn’t greatness in the making — he is greatness personified. Before he’s gone, take the time to appreciate his journey to where he is today and his surgical precision from the pocket, the likes of which we will never see again. Because when the confetti rains down on Brady in Houston on Sunday, it would be nice to give the GOAT a salute rather than the finger. He deserves that much.

Jung you are a fool. Brady and Belichick are cheaters pure and simple. The fact they favor Trump makes them stupid
besides. Why does he need a salute because he has been successful on the football field? Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees.
and Eli Manning have shown to be better QB’s just not with the right franchise like New England.
