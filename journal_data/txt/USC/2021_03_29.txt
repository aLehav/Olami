USC lost two of three games in a series against No. 10 UCLA this weekend at Dedeaux Field. 
The losses bring the Trojans to an overall record of 10-9 and a 4-2 record in Pac-12 play. The pair of wins help the Bruins improve to a 15-7 overall record and a similar 4-2 mark in conference play. 
USC had a slow start to the season but began picking up momentum after its six-game win streak in back-to-back series sweeps of Nevada and Washington. The Trojans have followed this mid-March win streak by dropping three of their last four games at the hands of San Diego and UCLA. 
“It was good to see us bounce back from our 3-6 start right there and go on that little run that we went on,” redshirt junior infielder Ben Ramirez said. “I think getting a taste of that and realizing that we played good baseball throughout those games and were locked in a lot of the time in all those innings in those games and trying to repeat that is I think something that we’re gonna try to do.” 
This is not the first time the Trojans and Bruins have met this season, with USC losing to UCLA earlier this season by a score of 10-1 at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
The Trojans won the first game of the series Friday in a closely-contested 5-4 battle. USC trailed 4-1 going into the bottom half of the ninth before scoring four runs to seal the walk-off comeback win.  
With the bases loaded, redshirt senior infielder Tyler Pritchard walked, bringing the score to 4-2. Redshirt junior infielder Jamal O’Guinn followed Pritchard by driving the ball into left field for an RBI double to tie the game at 4-4. Redshirt freshman outfielder Rhylan Thomas then hit a ground ball to UCLA’s shortstop, who overthrew the UCLA first baseman, allowing Pritchard to score and USC to win the game. 
“It was cool to see us fight till the very end right there,” Ramirez said. “I think that’s something we’ve been trying to work on as a team, just trying to put together quality at bats for the whole nine innings. It definitely brought us together a little bit more after getting that walk-off and getting that win.”
With the same starting lineup as Friday night, USC fell to UCLA 6-3 in their second game Saturday to tie the series and hand USC its first conference loss. 
Sunday’s rubber game had a slower start with neither teams scoring in the first inning. At the top of the second inning, UCLA senior outfielder Pat Caulfield hit a two-run homerun to give UCLA a 2-0 lead. USC responded with an RBI triple from Ramirez to cut the lead to 2-1. 
UCLA then ran with the lead in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings scoring a combined 10 runs to extend the lead to 12-1. Both teams followed with two offensively quiet innings with no runs scored. 
UCLA secured the blowout win in the series-deciding game, holding back the USC offense and scoring another run in the ninth to close out Sunday’s 13-1 Bruin victory. 
“We learned a lot from the game today,” Ramirez said. “Just trying to learn from that and making sure if it starts falling apart at some point in the game like that again that we can reel it back in and get back to playing the ball that we want to play.” 
Conference play will continue Thursday when USC travels to Berkeley for a three-game series. Before that, USC will head to LMU for a single-game matchup this week. The Trojans defeated the Lions twice in their season-opening three-game series earlier this season. First pitch between USC and LMU is Tuesday at 6 p.m.

The No. 1 women’s water polo team stayed perfect after a doubleheader win over No. 17 San José State this past weekend at home. The Trojans are 10-0 overall and 4-0 in MPSF conference play this season.
The two-game series kicked off Saturday with an afternoon game in which junior driver Grace Tehaney and redshirt senior goalie Holly Parker matched career highs — Tehaney getting 5 goals for the Trojans and Parker recording 10 saves from the Spartans.
Redshirt senior utility Maud Megens and driver Kelsey McIntosh did not play in either game, a joint decision made to let them rest and recover from another conditioning cycle.
USC was quick from the first whistle, scoring four unanswered in the first period, thanks to an array of players. Redshirt senior driver Denise Mammolito scored on a 5-meter penalty while senior driver Sabrina Garabet, junior utility Bayley Weber and Tehaney each scored points of their own. The Trojans followed up a busy offensive first period with five more goals in the second; the former was where SJSU was able to make some headway with a successful 6-on-5 drive and one from the field.
Carrying a 9-2 lead into the half, the offensive energy would diminish significantly for the Trojans, with the group getting just two more from Tehaney followed by a scoreless fourth period for both teams. A fresh rotation in junior utility Claire Haas, senior driver Kari Jensen, freshman 2-meter Hannah Meyer, sophomore utility Brooklyn Aguilera, senior 2-meter Randi Reinhardt and freshman driver Julia Janov allowed USC to work on their hard press on defense and move the ball around on man-ups with a greater number of players. 
“It definitely worked well. We’re trying to, with these changes in rotations … [communicate] the message that we need everybody to compete for the spot on a team,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “I think the younger players and players that don’t play a lot of minutes use their minutes wisely. And there’s definitely some promising minutes that we got from the players and indications that we could use players more … and [increase] rotations in the future.”
The Trojans would better their 11-5 Saturday win by one point Sunday, earning six in each half with hat tricks from Mammolito and Weber, two each from junior 2-meter Mireia Guiral and Tehaney, one from senior driver Verica Bakoc and junior utility Sophia Lucas’ first goal of the year. 
While the Spartans were only able to grab one point in the first half of Sunday’s game, four goals conceded in the final two periods indicated a pattern of second-half defensive fatigue, something the Trojans have been working on for multiple seasons.
Sophomore goalies Carolyne Stern and redshirt Erin Tharp were able to get some time in net, with three and one period, respectively and a combined 10 saves, further showing the potential of a Trojan squad that is using both experience and energy from new players to fuel its undefeated run.
Next weekend the Trojans will head to Indiana for two conference games against the Hoosiers on April 2 and 3, the first of four-straight MPSF opponents they’ll play heading into the conference championship in Tempe, Ariz. at the end of the month. Pintaric and company start bright and early in Bloomington at 9 a.m. on Friday and 10 a.m. on Saturday, PDT. 
“I’m looking forward for, our team to execute any roles their … coaches are putting them through,” Pintaric said. “ That’s why it’s really pleasure to coach this team because they are serious and they accept job duties, very responsibly and, again, they are looking forward to maybe even new rotations for next week.”

The Roxy Theatre was rocked by artists phem, Alice Longyu Gao, WRENN and other special guests during the first ever Pheelings Fest, a virtual music festival that was curated by phem and produced by NoCap. Tuning into the concert was like taking a step into a world that is very clearly influenced by past musical acts but that transforms those influences into new and exciting music.  
The virtual event opened up with DJ Alice Longyu Gao, and she made sure that her turntable was front and center during her set. Gao played unreleased songs as well as songs from her discography. The 26-year-old jumped all over the stage, which was adorned by a large Rubik’s cube and colorful blocks that looked like puzzle pieces. The decor matched Gao’s playful and nursery rhyme-like hyperpop tracks very well. Gao owned the stage with her moves and her turntable. 
“Mommy, I’m having so much fun. I love you,” Gao said in between a song. This moment captured the entire essence of Gao’s set. It was playful, energetic and, at times, musically chaotic. 
Next up was WRENN, whose bio on Spotify says she “plays loud music and wants everyone to get angry in a healthy way.” But, her performance elicited everything, but anger. 
WRENN exchanged chords with a secondary guitarist as she sang both quietly and sentimentally. She opened up her set with her song “Hailey” where she sang, “Now I’m packin’ a bag, but I gotta ask / Out of everyone, everyone else / Why’d it have to be Hailey?” This song set the tone for her entire set which was riddled with songs about heartbreak and love. WRENN’s performance felt very intimate and heartfelt, especially since she had no backing band except for a secondary guitarist. 
Royal & The Serpent, whose real name is Ryan Santiago, followed Wrenn’s set. Santiago’s performance included songs that were very personal, singing about topics such as her own mental health and substance usage. Her vocals were supported by crunchy electric guitars and a drummer that carried the rhythm section unabatedly. Santiago didn’t just sing, she also played some distorted power chords on an electric guitar for one of her songs. She also wasn’t the only singer on stage because phem made a special appearance to perform an unreleased song alongside Santiago. 
Her performance was reminiscent of legendary grunge artist Kurt Cobain and his band Nirvana, which Santiago has cited as significant inspirations for her music. 
Sueco the Child was next, and he changed things up considerably with his set. He rapped, sang a few unreleased songs and even made a few jokes. Sueco performed using backing tracks and a solitary drummer. At one point Sueco brought out rapper PmBata for a guest appearance. PmBata performed his song “Run It Up” where he raps about how he made his way up from “penny-pinchin’ and rappin’ in hallways” to “handling business.” 
Last but not least was Virgin Records artist, phem. The intro for her set began with an ominous and emotionless voice repeating the phrase, “You are now listening to phem,” over and over again. She wasted no time after the intro and immediately began singing “Self Control.” Phem also performed two new songs titled “Congratulations” and “American Beauty” which were released that same night after the concert. Both songs appear on her latest EP titled “how u stop hating urself (pt 1.5).” 
Tyler Posey, who appeared on MTV’s “Teen Wolf,” made a surprise appearance to play an acoustic version of a song called “Shut Up” that he made in collaboration with phem and Travis Barker, who was the drummer for Blink-182. That wasn’t the only surprise. phem covered early 2000s alternative classic “Teenage Dirtbag” by Wheatus. Her rendition was identical to the original as far as instrumentation and it was a nice homage to the alternative artists of the past. 
At the end of the concert, phem and Posey hung out for a little while and shared their thoughts about the event. 
“Pheelings fest forever,” phem said. 
“This is just the first one there’s going to be plenty more,” Posey said. 
Footage of the concert has not been posted anywhere as of yet, but the music for the entire lineup can be found on Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube.

Alright I’m going to let you in on a USC sports media secret: Men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield is one intimidating dude.
Originally from Shippensburg, Penn. but starting his coaching career at Florida Gulf Coast University, Enfield has this southern sharpness to his answers. He isn’t afraid to let you know when a question isn’t fair, but he keeps some distance when it comes to personal details about his job and the team. 
It’s curt, professional answers you expect going into these press conferences, and that is why I was so surprised when I heard his opening statement after the Kansas win Monday calling out CBS analysts.
“We were checking the scores and coach [Eric] Mobley pulled his phone out and on came the CBS studio,” Enfield said. “We’re not sure where it was, but the two guys picked Kansas because they said USC basketball and Andy Enfield-coached teams and USC teams [are] so undisciplined — they said very undisciplined — so Kansas is going to win.” 
Pretty cold — especially after dedicating the win to his late father who passed away in September. 
I’ve never seen Enfield this personal with the media, and maybe that’s because of the new territory he’s entering as a coach. As a current Elite Eight contender, Enfield has led men’s basketball from oblivion into the national college basketball discourse. He’s been at the helm of this program for almost eight years, and new attention means a new edge to defend his squad.
Keep it up Enfield. Your team demands this energy in the postseason, and the USC brand needs a little attitude right now. 
What I’m getting at here is how Enfield went beyond the expected answers, and the media coaching he’s received as a D1 figure. I hear the same phrases over and over again at media events: “It was a team effort,” “We don’t celebrate,” “We look forward to the next game,” “Filled with pride,” etc. It’s always the gushy, proud PR statements athletes and coaches recite. Just take a look at what the USC Student-Athlete Handbook interview section tells them to say.
When doing interviews, representatives of USC Athletics are expected to “be positive,” “be humble,” “turn a negative question into a positive answer,” “don’t use slang” and most coercing of all, “smile and have fun.”
There is no mention of honesty in answers or incorporating personal messaging. Players and coaches are taught to say what people want to hear. 
As a sports journalist, I’m not surprised, and quite honestly going into a press conference with predictable sound bites can make an article easier to write. 
But maybe such routine interview behavior should be a cause for concern. If we set up these press conferences to get a team voice, don’t we want their words to be genuine and not rehearsed?
Interviewing, especially in the world of sports, is inherently personal. These young athletes put their literal blood, sweat and tears into these media entities’ game screen times, and it makes sense for there to be bitterness when such media discredits their effort.
Sports media demands courtesy and professionalism while piling on harsh criticism. Players and coaches can’t just fold to the handbook and turn every negative into a positive. Enfield told us not only how CBS anchors disrespected his team — he showed us what possibly lit the match for a 34-point beat down in the Sweet 16.
With USC on the brink of a deep postseason run, I hope Enfield and his squad keep the filter off with public comments. As tournament underdogs, it’s the sharp press conference soundbites that form a fan following large enough to make an impact. 
Great teams and great coaches aren’t remembered for their media grooming. Enfield reminded us what it means to defend your team, and for that he has my utmost respect — even if it leaves me terrified in the press box.

The USC women’s soccer team defeated the Arizona Wildcats Friday by a score of 1-0. USC junior forward Penelope Hocking, who faced off her twin sister Arizona junior Iliana Hocking, was the lone scorer for the game. 
USC is now 4-3-1 overall, with a 3-3 record in Pac-12 play. The Wildcats fell to 6-4, with a 1-4 Pac-12 record.
Both Arizona sophomore goalkeeper Hope Hisey and USC redshirt senior goalkeeper Kaylie Collins put on an impressive defensive first half, with three saves and one save respectively. In the first half, Arizona only shot the ball four times, while USC had nine shots. 
“I thought [the defense] was fantastic,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I thought they were communicating very well. Moving forward we expect and hope to get those kinds of performances every time we step out.”
One of USC’s best first-half tries came in the 22nd minute, with a booming shot from sophomore midfielder Croix Bethune. However, Hisey made a leaping save, punching the ball out of bounds. Overall, USC dominated the first half with their ball control, but the slow pace of play forced by the Arizona defense kept the Trojans from scoring.
The second half started with both teams continuing to dominate on the defensive end. An early free kick by senior midfielder Savannah DeMelo just barely missed wide of the goalpost in the 46th minute. In the 68th minute, Arizona senior forward Jill Aguilera’s free kick attempt was saved by Collins. 
In the 71st minute, senior forward Tara McKeown briefly went down after colliding with a teammate on the offensive side of the field. However, she played through, making an excellent pass to Hocking, who secured her fifth goal of the season in the 77th minute with a strong kick from outside the box. Hocking has scored 37 goals in her three seasons at USC. 
“[McKeown] is probably the most tough player we have on our team,” McAlpine said. “Not only does she play through pain, but she tackles, she runs, she works, and it’s a spark plug for everything that we do.”
The duo of McKeown and Hocking continues to light up the stat sheet for USC with a combined 10 goals and three assists between the two for the season. 
After the goal, USC became less aggressive and more defensive-minded, which led to an elevated offensive attack for the Wildcats in the dwindling minutes of the game. In the 84th minute, Aguilera had a great chance to tie up the game off of a well-placed ball from Arizona senior Jada Talley, but her attempt was wide of the goal. The defense came through for USC even though offense struggled throughout the game. 
After a tough road stretch where USC went 0-2-1, they are now back in the win column. 
“It feels great, because I think the team needed it. I think they needed to feel a little success,” McAlpine said. “Pretty happy for the team that they can start to feel, and they can see the fruit of their labor.”
The Trojans will play their next two games at home, where they are undefeated and have not allowed a goal since the season opener. The Washington Huskies and Washington State University Cougars will both make the trip next weekend to face the Trojans. 
Washington is coming off of a three game win streak, and their only Pac-12 loss this season has come from Stanford University. Washington State has also had an impressive season, sitting at 5-1-1 having only lost to Washington. 
The Trojan’s game against the Huskies will be at 6:00 p.m. Friday. They then face the Cougars on Sunday, at 12:00 p.m. 
Both games will be streamed on the Pac-12 Network.

March Madness puts the college basketball stars under the brightest lights, but, oftentimes, role players are the defining characters of the drama driving game results with their timely play. 
Enter redshirt senior guard Isaiah White. White earned his starting lineup spot with his tough defense and rebounding capabilities. But on Sunday night, he stepped up in a new way torching the Oregon Ducks with 22 points and providing the intensity needed to lead USC to an 82-66 win over Oregon in the Sweet 16 matchup.
“I feel like the team feeds off my energy,” White said in the virtual press conference Sunday night. “I make sure out the gate that I come with that energy and come with that heart, and hopefully it makes everyone else comfortable, and then we just get to playing our game.”
In the battle of the first- and second-placed teams in the Pac-12 regular season, it was the conference runner ups that came out on top. This is the first time USC has reached the Elite Eight since 2001.
The Ducks went on a 11-0 run to mount a late comeback, holding USC scoreless for upwards of five minutes late in the second half. They got their momentum from second chance looks on the offensive glass, cutting their deficit to just nine points with four minutes left. With some timely buckets, the Trojans pulled away in the last few minutes to seal the win.
“It was a great win for us,” Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “Oregon is just an outstanding team, and they were playing so well … We thought they were a top 10 team in the country … I thought our team played exceptionally well tonight against a very good basketball team.”
USC has yet to lose a game this season when they’ve had three or more players score in double digits. It was four players Sunday night: White, redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy with 20, sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley with 13 and freshman forward Evan Mobley with 10. The team continued to light it up from beyond the arc, hitting 10 three pointers which doubled Oregon’s total on the night.
“We’re a whole different team when we can make threes,” Enfield said. “Some of our losses this year we’ve been very inconsistent from the perimeter, and we’re shooting the ball well as a team right now.”
Defensively, USC turned to the 2-3 zone used against Kansas in the Round of 32. It was equally effective in the first half against the Ducks, forcing bad passes and contested shots late on the shot clock. 
“They have five forwards and guards that can all shoot the three,” Enfield said. “They made some shots early, and we had to switch to zone … When [they were] small, I didn’t think we [could] guard them man-to-man and win the game.”
Oregon’s offense had been a force to be reckoned with in the tournament, but their production came from just two main sources on the night. Senior guard Chris Duarte was the Ducks’ front man, posting 21 points and six assists. However, redshirt senior forward Eugene Omoruyi ultimately led in scoring, putting up 28 points and causing problems for the Trojan defense all night. The two combined for 49 of Oregon’s 66 total points, with other teammates shut down. 
The Trojans now look towards their biggest tournament challenge yet: No. 1 seed undefeated Gonzaga. The Elite Eight game is set to tip off Tuesday at 4:15 p.m.
“I don’t know about what everyone else is saying, all I know is that this team is special and we believe we can beat anybody,” White said. “We’re gonna play our game, we’re gonna listen to what the game plan is and we’re gonna execute.”

When Evan (Brady Noon) is cut from the famous Mighty Ducks because he’s too small for the prestigious 12-14 age bracket, his mom Alex (television’s favorite single mom Lauren Graham) has a meltdown over the absurdity of the youth sports world where twelve-year-olds have college counselors and sports psychologists. She and Evan decide to start their own team, the “Don’t Bothers,” where kids can play for fun. 
Despite a few early struggles and bullying from the rest of the Ducks, Evan quickly assembles a team of misfits with little athletic ability, all wanting to just be kids and play a sport they love. 
With days left to register the team and nowhere to practice, Alex comes across the Ice Palace, a worn down children’s party destination run by none other than a grumpy, bitter Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez). He refuses at first to let the team practice at the rink, claiming he hates hockey and kids, but Alex convinces him, beginning an entertaining relationship of playful bickering and possible romance between the characters. 
“Game Changers” strays from “The Mighty Ducks” of the ‘90s because the original team of loveable losers is now the bad guy, but the modern take keeps the same spirit of camaraderie and believing in the underdog. There are cheeky references to the movies, like when Alex asks Gordon if he’s ever heard of the Mighty Ducks or when the kids rave about the inventor of the Flying V. 
Fans of the original movies will love Estevez’s triumphant return as the legendary Gordon Bombay, and new viewers will enjoy his character’s off-beat sarcasm. Instead of being just another single mom, Lauren Graham’s heartfelt and hilarious performance singlehandedly makes the show worthy of the beloved “Mighty Ducks” title. 
The uber-talented kids easily hold their own next to their A-list co-stars. Brady Noon was the perfect choice to lead a new generation of Mighty Ducks: He has the comedic chops to carry the sitcom, but he still lets Evan be a wholeheartedly real kid. Maxwell Simkins steals every scene as the adorable sports podcaster and Mighty Duck-wannabe Nick, and Swayam Bhatia is definitely one of the breakout stars as the overwhelmed Sofi, who wants to join the new team but is afraid of disappointing her parents. 
Even with their limited screen time, we’re already rooting for the rest of the unique, loveable “Don’t Bothers” by the end of the pilot. Taegen Burns shines as Maya, a popular girl struggling to fit in. Lauren, the school outcast who dresses like a warrior princess, is somehow still relatable thanks to Bella Higginbotham’s portrayal, and De’Jon Watts is impressive as daredevil skater Sam. Joining the team also are pro-video gamer Koob (talented newcomer Luke Islam) and Logan, the new kid who has all the hockey gear and none of the skills (played by Kiefer O’Reilly with impeccable comedic timing). The show wouldn’t work without the incredible cast. 
Hidden behind the nostalgia and witty comedy is a commentary on the insane pressure kids — and people in general — are under today to fit in; to be perfect and to have their lives completely figured out. The show opts for an honest, instead of condescending, portrayal of the issues kids deal with, but it never strays from the light-hearted, comfortable atmosphere. 
While it centers on a group of preteens, the show’s message applies to everyone. In the days where burnout and win-at-all-costs attitudes dominate, “Game Changers” glorifies teamwork and reminds us that some things are just meant to be fun, which is exactly what the show is.
Writers Steven Brill, Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa know how to cater to viewers of all ages, welcoming a new generation of fans without forgetting about the old. There’s something in it for everyone to enjoy. Even though problems are solved a little too easily and conflict is a bit lacking, it’s still more than just a cheesy kid’s show or a hasty reboot.
“The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers” probably won’t be winning any Emmys this year, but the new series isn’t about winning. Its best moments so far don’t come from scoring goals or winning games. Instead, it leads with genuineness and heart, and the comedy works because of its relatability. It’s sweet and simple — something we could all really use right now.

Americans would benefit greatly from reading more about Bobby Kennedy. 
That’s Bobby Kennedy — B-O-B-B-Y (of course also known by his legal name, Robert F. Kennedy) — not his brother, President John F. Kennedy, not his other brother,  Sen. Ted Kennedy, and not his grandson, Congressman Joe Kennedy III. I am talking about Bobby Kennedy, the former U.S. Attorney General, U.S. Senator and slain Presidential candidate; and perhaps no book offers a more objective, thoughtful and inspiring survey of his life and legacy than Larry Tye’s book “Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon.”
Tye’s book is the product of more than 400 interviews conducted over the course of four years, including interviews with some of the most trusted members of Kennedy’s inner-circle, such as his wife, Ethel Kennedy, and his aide and closest friend, John Seigenthaler. As you would expect, the biography tells the story of its subject, Kennedy, but Tye’s work differs from the abundance of Bobby Kennedy-centered biographies and literature in two key respects. 
The first way Tye separates his biography from previous Kennedy biographies is in his attention to the earliest, sometimes overlooked, chapters of Kennedy’s life. Kennedy’s youth, experiences as counsel to the infamous Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Chief Counsel to the McClellan Committee and campaign manager for John F. Kennedy are thoroughly fleshed out, with Tye taking his time to contextualize each phase of Kennedy’s life in both the icon’s narrative and intellectual moral arc. In fact, nearly one third of the book passes before readers see Kennedy assume the most powerful position of his life, the U.S. Attorney General. 
The second, and also most important, respect in which Tye’s biography differs from the abundance of other biographies printed over the decades since Kennedy’s assassination in 1968 is the book’s treatment of Kennedy’s life. As the New York Times former chief book critic, Michiko Kakutani, pointed out, a “reductive” dichotomy between “good Bobby” and “bad Bobby” has previously been employed by writers. Such was the case in Ronald Steel’s disparaging 2000 biography, “In Love with Night: The American Romance with Bobby Kennedy,” which Kakutani and Tye both allude to, and such has been the case in countless other works, a fact that is also tacitly and explicitly engaged with by Tye. 
But Tye, for his part, doesn’t box his book or his reader into making an absolute choice between “good Bobby” and “bad Bobby,” and this is where “The Making of a Liberal Icon” shines brightest. 
The less savory, even shameful elements of Kennedy’s life and personality are not sugarcoated: he aided and maintained a relationship with one of the most despicable men in American political history (McCarthy), earned a reputation as a ruthless political operative as his brother’s campaign manager, advocated for hawkish, unnecessarily violent policies toward Latin America and lived a life of almost unimaginable privilege that left him out of touch with America’s poor and marginalized.
Tye makes it clear that the list does not end there — not in its length or in its degree of immorality — but he also reassures that the list doesn’t define Bobby Kennedy in his entirety. Kennedy resigned from McCarthy’s committee and wrote the minority report that censured the senator. Kennedy took responsibility for his brother’s policies in Latin America and Southeast Asia and ran as a progressive in 1968 on the promise of ending the war in Vietnam. Finally, whereas Kennedy’s life could not have been more far-removed from the challenges of America’s downtrodden, he found a way, through sustained action and compassion, to become one of America’s greatest champions for civil rights, minority-empowerment and the poor. 
This is not to suggest that the merits of the latter half of Kennedy’s career outweigh the failures of the first half. It is also not to suggest that Kennedy’s moral arc is that plainly linear. What it is supposed to communicate, however, are the contradictions of Kennedy’s life; his evolution, his changes and his flawed humanity. 
It is in capturing this humanity where “The Making of a Liberal Icon,” achieves the most present-day salience. During a time where some of the most prominent leaders of the political right and left have achieved seemingly God-like statuses, Tye’s portrait of Kennedy reminds readers of the nuanced, almost disappointingly complex, reality behind our political icons.

What makes a “good guy?” 
Is it the fact that he is polite? Is it the fact that he gives away Teslas? Is it that his boyish giggles make him appear non-threatening?
People are so shocked that YouTuber David Dobrik has enabled disgusting behaviors such as sexual assault and the general mistreatment of those involved in his vlogs, but I have to ask: What kind of stuff did people think he was up to to begin with? Has David Dobrik ever shown the public that he is willing to stand up for what is right even if it conflicted with his career or bottom line?   
I’m not here to rip Dobrik apart specifically, although he does make for nice clickbait. Rather, I want to talk about the archetype of person that he represents to the public eye. I think that it’s time we talk philosophy and ask ourselves “What makes a good person” or at the very least, what does not. 
Anyone can look like a decent person from afar. Whether it’s a YouTuber or your neighbor, anyone can throw around enough pleases, thank yous and G-d bless yous to convince you that they generally do the right thing. For that reason, I am not big on words in assessing character.   
Using Dobrik as a case study, there are a few talking points that people reference when discussing all the good he has done. First, there’s the fact that he gives away Teslas to his friends like they’re Tic Tacs. While doing so provides a net positive outcome to all those involved, I do not think it speaks to how good of a person Dobrik is himself. 
In my books, what makes a person good is how they act when the kinder course of action directly conflicts with the actor’s own self-interest. Goodness that speaks to one’s character demands self-sacrifice. 
There is nothing more self sacrificial in giving away a Tesla for a YouTube video than there is in investing heavily into production costs on a movie set. Both improve the quality of the work and are investments that will likely have handsome returns. It’s a nice thing to do, but it doesn’t make you a nice person (though some more utilitarian-leaning students and philosophers may harshly disagree with me).   
I personally respect people with a strong moral character. Before the anti-cancel culture troglodytes come for me, I want to clarify that this doesn’t mean public figures are never allowed to mess up, grow or redeem themselves. But the way I personally navigate these YouTube streets is by asking myself if I’ve ever seen a certain creator stand up for what they believe to be right at the potential expense of a few career points. If they have, then I am more inclined to trust that they are a good person and more likely to be disappointed at any profound moral blunders of theirs. 
The reason that I think self sacrifice is a good metric for kindness is because, if you’re lucky, life is going to inevitably hand you over some opportunities to be a bad person and gain from it. In the same fashion that you’re only as strong as your weakest link, I truly believe that you’re only as nice as your behavior in situations that make unethical choices the most tempting — in situations that make you the most morally weak.  
I have placed Dobrik in the category of non-self-sacrificial, not only because of the many testimonials that paint him as such, but mostly because of his lack of controversy in the name of the greater good despite being the king of YouTube for a sizable reign. He’s never sat down and ruffled any feathers for something in the name of ethics. 
I am weary of a person like Dobrik, who (until now) had a squeaky clean reputation, in life but specifically online. If we agree that certain, if not many, normative behaviors are unethical, then it makes sense to be suspicious of people who defend and embody those norms a little too hard — so hard that they’ve never really deviated from those norms before. This sentiment is only amplified by the online context of Dobrik’s situation, given that we have always known the entertainment industry to be chock full of morally bankrupt practices. 
I am not trying to say that in order to be trustworthy in the public eye you need to be controversial. But I do think that if you’re a vlogger trying to promote your lifestyle, then you should at least stick your neck out to promote a good one, even if it affects your bottom line. We’ve never seen Dobrik do that before, and that’s probably why so many were convinced he is just a typical good guy who doesn’t get into trouble. 
I am tired of people falling for such shallow “good person” acts. It should take real sacrifice and meaningful action to be considered a “good guy.” The squeaky clean act is bullshit and I am over it. 
I’ll end with a saying that has served me with a lot of guidance in analyzing situations like these: believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see.

After over a year of masks, social distancing and lockdown, along with thousands of deaths at the hands of the coronavirus, some legislators’ perspectives on coronavirus restrictions seem to have shifted. 
This was the case in Colorado. Colorado has historically been a purple state. In the last couple of years, it has leaned left, which is why it was shocking to hear that Gov. Jared Polis released a new set of coronavirus guidelines which included the loosening of mask mandates. This announcement came two weeks after President Joe Biden said these types of notions are “big mistakes[s]” and were advised  against by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Not only does this move in Colorado put into question how other legislators — such as ones in California — will react, lifting the mask mandate will only prolong the pandemic for everyone. Although lifting some restrictions at a steady pace as more people get vaccinated and new cases slow is understandable, taking a step like this seems to be more political than rational. 
For places like Los Angeles where cases are steady and vaccination will soon be available to people over the age of 16, it makes sense to loosen restrictions. This, however, is not the case in Colorado where coronavirus numbers are still on the rise, especially after the party at University of Colorado Boulder where hundreds of college students gathered without masks or regard for the pandemic. In addition, only 15% of Colorado is immune to the virus; the state has not yet reached the herd immunity necessary to begin having discussions of lifting mask mandates. 
Although the mask mandate will only be lifted in green level areas and are still a requirement for students aged 11 to 18, there seems to be political and economic undertones behind this decision. 
Many people — from all political sides — were against mask mandates, but some right leaning groups have particularly struggled with following requirements since the beginning, and this has led to a lot of pressure in state governments to reopen quickly. This was seen in Texas, where the mask mandate was lifted not long ago, and now in Colorado.
There are also economic undertones to this decision. Polis never wanted to go into a lockdown in the first place, worrying about the businesses that supported his election campaign. The decision to lift the mandate for masks should be made for the right reasons — without political or financial influences — and should keep in mind the potential lives that will be endangered by this decision. 
Colorado’s rash decision is not a one-off, considering USC sent out a letter just last week that described lifting more restrictions, such as extending library time and campus activities, despite the increase in travel over the past week that caused a rise in cases on campus. Legislators around the United States, and especially in L.A., who are seeing similar agitation, must not give into irrational demands to take steps toward reopening that are too large. Instead, they must take slow steps that are conscious of CDC guidance to not only ensure that normalcy comes sooner but that lives do not continue to be lost.
