During USC’s 2011 Pac-12 road opener at Arizona State, the Trojans watched running back Cameron Marshall rip off a 70-yard touchdown run on just the fourth play from scrimmage, giving the Sun Devils an early 7-0 edge.
The scoring play would propel Arizona State to a 43-22 win at Sun Devil Stadium.
More than a year later, Marshall’s run also serves as a reminder of what was a glaring problem for USC in its first two seasons under coach Lane Kiffin: giving up the big play.
In 2010, the Trojans, on average, gave up 5.91 yards per play, placing them 90th among Football Bowl Subdivision teams. And in 2011, that mark dipped just slightly, as they surrendered 5.4 yards per play — good for 58th nationally.
Through five games this season, though, No. 11 USC has displayed noticeable improvement in this regard.
“We’re not giving up as many explosive plays as we did the first two years -— definitely in the passing game,” Kiffin said.
Of the 12 touchdowns the team has allowed in 2012, just three have come on plays of more than 20 yards. And in terms of yards per play, USC stands 22nd among 124 FBS teams, allowing 4.73 yards per play.
“We’ve made teams have to work and that’s why the scoring has been lower,” Kiffin said. “Guys have had to work to go down the field and a lot of times the offense screws it up.”
The numbers indicate as much. USC is giving up 19.4 points per game, roughly seven fewer than at this same point a season ago.
But the Trojans’ third-year coach is reserving judgment for now.
“You have to be careful of the stats and who you play and all that stuff,” Kiffin said. “We have not played the quality of quarterbacks that we had played in the previous two years to this point. Before we make this statement ‘Boy, we’ve improved so much on defense,’ we got to make sure we look at the whole thing together.”
USC had faced Arizona State quarterback Brock Osweiler and Arizona signal caller Nick Foles through this point last season. Both were selected in April’s NFL draft: Osweiler in the second round (57th overall) by the Denver Broncos and Foles in the third round (88th overall) by the Philadelphia Eagles.
 
Quick hits
— Kiffin announced during his post-practice news conference Wednesday that sophomore safety Josh Shaw has taken reps at the cornerback spot during practice this week.
— USC will practice for the final time Thursday before traveling to Seattle on Friday for its game against Washington at CenturyLink Field on Saturday night.
— USC has sold out its Oct. 20 game against Colorado, the school announced Tuesday. This will be the second home sellout this season. The Trojans’ season opener against Hawaii was listed as a sellout and so are two remaining games: Nov. 3 against No. 2 Oregon and Nov. 24 against No. 7 Notre Dame.

USC sophomore Marqise Lee is already one of the most dynamic players in college football as a wide receiver and kick returner. CBSSports.com’s weekly Heisman Trophy Straw Poll ranked Lee fourth, after all.
But if it was up to the talented wideout, he’d do even more for the No. 11 Trojans.
Playing both ways · Sophomore Marqise Lee approached USC coach Lane Kiffin about playing cornerback in addition to wide receiver. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
On the return flight home to Los Angeles following last Thursday’s win at Utah, Lee lobbied USC coach Lane Kiffin for snaps on defense at the second cornerback spot opposite junior Nickell Robey.
Kiffin entertained the idea the next day, a sign of the desperate times facing USC’s secondary. But by Tuesday, Kiffin said he had dismissed the radical strategy — although he didn’t exactly give a definitive response.
“Not right now, no,” Kiffin said. “He is so valuable in the reps [on offense] where the ball doesn’t go to him based off of defenses that are called… [But] if he wanted to play defense, he’d be a first-round corner.”
A first-round talent at the second cornerback spot is exactly what the Trojan defense needs; redshirt junior Torin Harris and freshman Kevon Seymour both gave up touchdowns while playing as the second corner against the Utes, and Harris gave up another that was offset by a penalty.
Even Lee’s defensive teammates agree that he could add to the secondary.
“He could help wherever he lines up on the field,” said senior safety T.J. McDonald. “Wherever he winds up, he can make plays.”
Robey responded along the same lines.
“Marqise is an athlete, I don’t doubt that he could play defensive back,” he said. “But I just don’t know how serious [Kiffin] was when he said that [Lee could play defense].”
Trojan fans should hope that Kiffin wasn’t serious.
There’s no doubt that Lee has torn up the field on offense (52 receptions, 649 receiving yards, 7 touchdowns) and special teams (26.7 kick return average, 1 touchdown). Since Matt Barkley has performed below expectations, Lee might have the best shot of anyone on the current roster at being USC’s first Heisman Trophy winner since Reggie Bush — I mean, Matt Leinart.
But Lee is simply too valuable on offense to give him time on the other side of the ball and risk him getting injured.
Amid Barkley and junior wide receiver Robert Wood’s occasional hiccups this season, Lee has been the model of consistency for the Trojans, ranking second in the country with an average of 10.4 receptions per game and fourth nationally with 129.8 receiving yards per contest.
But despite the confidence shown by Lee, his coach and his teammates, it’s hard to tell if Lee’s talent would pay immediate dividends on defense.
Though he did play both ways in high school, Lee spent most of his time on defense at strong safety, which let him be more of a ballhawk than most corners are allowed to be.
There could also be a learning curve with the intricacies of Monte Kiffin’s defense; after all, two years ago, Robey was the corner getting picked on by opposing offenses.
Even though Lee dismissed concerns that he would tire from the extra snaps, you never know when cramps can pop up and take out a player during a crucial point in a game.
And since Lee has emerged this season as Barkley’s security blanket, accounting for just under half of Barkley’s 1,308 passing yards, it would be a major disadvantage to have him on the sidelines during an important drive.
Besides, it might be unwise to rule out the possibility of a dark horse in the secondary stepping up and claiming the second corner spot.
Redshirt sophomore Josh Shaw, currently listed as the third-string strong safety, played both safety and cornerback at Florida before transferring to USC in January, and Kiffin said the staff is considering switching Shaw to corner.
Redshirt freshman cornerback Ryan Henderson elicited whoops from his teammates at Wednesday’s practice with a red zone interception during a scrimmage.
And of course, Harris or Seymour could recover from their performance against the Utes and quiet all this talk by shutting down Washington’s flankers Saturday.
“It’s a spot that we’re working on,” McDonald said. “We may not have had the results that we want every week on game day. But I promise you one thing: We are working at it, and we’re trying to get better.”
The Trojans will be better off if Lee just keeps doing what he does best — scoring touchdowns. Not preventing them.

The No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team had no answer for Stanford’s stonewall defense at the net, falling 3-0 Wednesday night at Maples Pavilion in Palo Alto in the first leg of their Northern California road trip.
“We got some good performances today, but we didn’t also didn’t get some of the performances that we needed to get, and that really did us in tonight,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We had too many hitting errors today, and you can’t do that against a good team.”
Though the Women of Troy (16-3, 4-3) had 37 kills over the course of the match, they only accomplished that on a .085 hitting percentage. By comparison, Stanford finished with 44 kills with a .350 percentage.
Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio and senior opposite Katie Fuller struggled to get USC’s offense going, combining for just 16 kills.
The Women of Troy started out strong early in the first set with freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio garnering four kills early.
Stanford went on a run to go up 8-5. The Cardinal continued to control the net before sophomore setter Hayley Crone served back-to-back aces to tie it at 11.
The first set continued to be a back-and-forth affair with USC, led by junior outside hitter Sara Shaw, who led players with 13 kills. Stanford, however, would pull away before finishing off the set 25-18.
The Women of Troy couldn’t recapture their fast start from the last set, with the Cardinal capturing an early 7-2 lead.
Following a stretch with two kills and a block by Jordan Burgess, Stanford extended their lead to a disheartening 12-4 score. The Cardinal continued to pour it on as Rachel Williams dominated the set at the net by putting the game almost out of reach at 19-8.
The Women of Troy rallied late and got the score within striking distance behind three straight blocks from junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard, but the deficit proved too much and USC stumbled, 25-16.
The third set looked very similar to the previous two. USC fell early and Stanford quickly stole the momentum to win the set 25-18.
Despite the defeat, the Women of Troy will have to regroup to face California on Friday.
“The expectation will be that we suck it up, work on what we need to work on in practice and go in their building and try to come out with a win,” Haley said. “It’s going to be tough playing a late game on the road, but it will be a good challenge,”
Neil Jariwalla contributed to this story.
Time for a change with the coaching staff especially the assistants. Haley appears to have lost the ability to recruit the good local talent. Getting swept by Stanford w/o scoring even 20 pts. in one set is pretty sad. This was the third sweep against them already in the conference season. They are regressing instead of starting to peak which is a
tell tale sign of poor coaching by the staff. Haley has blown three final four appearances over the the last # of years losing to Minnesota, Cal, and Illinois.

While most sports fans comfortably watched the 2012 Olympic Games unfold from their couches at home, USC senior swimmer Haley Anderson was in the water for nearly two hours — one hour, 57 minutes and 38.6 seconds, to be exact. Most of the attention for Olympic swimming centers on what happens in the pool, but Anderson was attempting to give the United States glory in the open-water 10K Marathon at Hyde Park in London.
When she reached the finish line, she was 0.4 seconds shy from taking gold.
“Everybody afterwards was like, ‘Oh my God, you got second, you were 0.4 off,” Anderson said. “But I got a medal at the Olympics. I didn’t care that it was silver.”
It was more than just silver, however — it was the first time that an American had ever medaled in the event.
“There’s no disappointment,” said USC men’s and women’s swimming coach Dave Salo. “She demonstrated that she’s one of the best in the world. Here she was going to her first Olympic games, and she comes back with a medal.”
Along with her open-water prowess, Anderson, 20, has also been successful in the pool, taking the NCAA and Pac-12 titles in the 500-yard freestyle and her third-straight Pac-12 title in the 1,650-yard freestyle last year.
Anderson currently holds USC records in the 500-yard, 1,000-yard and 1,650-yard freestyles, as well as in the 800-yard freestyle relay.
“We’ve learned in the last three years that she has been here that she’s tough as nails when she trains,” Salo said. “I felt really confident that she would be tough enough to compete against anybody.”
Many perceived Anderson as an underdog before the marathon because her documented success was in the pool rather than in open water, but it was a label that she graciously accepted.
“Nobody knew how I raced. I never raced some of these top girls, so they didn’t know me and know my strategy,” Anderson said.
During the race in London, which spanned 10 kilometers and looped the lake known as “The Serpentine” six times, Anderson had a different plan of attack.
“Normally I’ll start out in the back and work my way up. I knew this time I had to be in the front at the beginning,” Anderson said. “I knew that would give me a good position for the finish.”
In the final 1,000 meters of the race, Anderson surged from fourth to second place to finish 3.2 seconds faster than Italy’s Martina Grimaldi and 0.4 seconds short of Hungary’s Eva Risztov.
No one would dispute the insanity of swimming 10 kilometers — two of the 25 swimmers were pulled out of the water during the race and needed medical treatment. But nonetheless, the physical nature of the marathon often goes unnoticed.
“It’s kind of a brutal sport. There’s stuff going on that you don’t necessarily see,” Salo said. “It’s not like pool swimming where you got your own lane. There’s a lot of crowding and a lot of grabbing.”
In preparation for the Olympics, Anderson maintained her training focus in the pool and occasionally spent 30 to 40 minutes swimming in the ocean on Sundays.
“She beat a lot of swimmers who have been open-water training, and it’s been their whole deal and their big passion,” Salo said. “We didn’t do anything different, so it was exciting from that standpoint.”
It is hard to top a historic Olympic medal, but Anderson claims she’s not done quite yet.
“Finishing out my last year of eligibility, hopefully defending my title and getting another in the mile — that’s definitely my goal for this year,” Anderson said. “And Rio 2016 is definitely a possibility.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary on Tuesday, Oct. 9.
Crimes against a person
at 9:24 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of two non-USC males involved in an altercation inside the Norris Medical Library and detained them for investigation. The officers determined that the dispute was only verbal and both subjects were released after being advised that any further disturbances would result in them being barred from the facility.
Crimes against property
at 9:02 a.m., two witnesses reported they observed a group of people detain a suspect who appeared to be fleeing from Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street possibly with a stolen laptop computer. The laptop was recovered from the suspect and returned to an unidentified male who then left the area. The suspect also left the area and he and the male could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 11:49 a.m., DPS officers responded to a traffic collision on Olive Street and Washington Boulevard involving two vehicles, one of which was a University vehicle driven by a staff member. An LAFD RA unit was at the scene examining the driver of the second vehicle when the officers arrived, and the driver was subsequently released to seek medical treatment on his own. LAPD officers were also present to conduct a traffic investigation.

The USC School of Cinematic Arts announced Monday in an email to students that actor James Franco will teach a film production class for the spring semester.
The class, which will be co-taught by Franco’s business partner Vince Jolivette, requires students to make a 10-minute film related to the course theme of “The Labyrinth,” according to the email. The films will be compiled into one longer film at the end of the course, with each short film serving as an exploration of “the unknown, the unexplained and the unimaginable.”
Neale Hemrajani, a second year graduate student studying film production, plans to apply for one of the class’ eight spots. Hemrajani feels that having two prominent professors will give students a professional edge.
“With James Franco’s name attached to it, you know it’s going to go somewhere, and it’s a great opportunity for any student to have their work seen,” he said.
In addition to maintaining a high-profile acting career, Franco has attended several universities, including UCLA, Yale University and Columbia University. He previously taught a class at New York University about creating short films based on poetry.
Franco’s next film, Oz: The Great and Powerful, is set to be released in March. Some students, like Quinn Mason, a junior majoring in critical studies, worry that Franco’s acting career will interfere with his obligations at USC.
“I’m sure [the class] would be something interesting, but he’s everywhere,” Mason said. “I’m not sure he’ll have that much time to dedicate to the club and the students.”

New research by the Brain and Creativity Institute at USC determined that whether a person likes or dislikes someone can affect how their brain processes their actions.
Past research shows that the way your brain processes another person’s simple motor actions — such as finger movements — can be influenced by what the person looks like and whether they are more or less physically similar to yourself. For instance, people tend to have more empathy toward those who look similar to them.
The paper’s lead author, Mona Sobhani, said she wanted to add on to this research by looking into the effects of groups on perception. Sobhani is a third-year graduate student studying neuroscience at USC.
“We were interested in seeing if a construct like group membership — whether you belong to one social group or another — could alter the way your brain perceives someone else’s actions, when the person whose actions you are viewing is similar to yourself physically,” Sobhani said.
In the study, Jewish subjects were presented with likable people and Neo-Nazis. Researchers based the study on the perception that it is socially acceptable for Jewish individuals to dislike a social group that explicitly dislikes them and can even sometimes be threatening to them.
Participants viewed two-second video clips of subjects performing simple actions, such as drinking from a water bottle, and their responses were recorded. Before seeing the clips, the participants were informed that about half of the people in the videos held strongly anti-Semitic beliefs while others came from neutral backgrounds.
The participants were asked to rate how much they liked the subjects of the videos before and after they saw the clips. Analysis of the subjects’ responses to seeing each video clip revealed that the actions of Neo-Nazis were more unpleasant than the same actions performed by “likable” example individuals.
“This is an important finding because it suggests that an abstract social factor, and not a visual difference per se, can affect how you perceive the person,” Sobhani said. “It is especially interesting that this extends to such a simple motor action as reaching for and grasping a water bottle.”
Sobhani said the next step is to investigate whether the brain processes the actions of disliked individuals differently even if it is not socially acceptable to dislike them.
These results contribute to the longstanding evidence supporting the notion that perception of in-group and out-group members implicitly biases information processing in fundamental neural networks.

Anthony Bailey was officially  appointed vice provost for Global Initiatives on Oct. 1, USC announced Wednesday.
He has held the position on an interim basis since August.
Bailey was previously the associate provost for Global Initiatives, a position in which he assisted in planning USC’s London conference and worked with foreign governments to establish overseas offices and recruit Ph.D. students, according to a memo to USC faculty and staff.
This new position will require working closely with Provost Elizabeth Garret on global matters, such as collaboration with foreign universities and recruiting international students.
“He will advise me regarding the full range of international issues, oversee USC’s international offices, direct the agreements process with foreign institutions and understand other initiatives that solidify USC’s position as a premier global research university,” Garret wrote in the memo.
Bailey currently oversees USC’s offices in Mexico City; Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai, China; Taipei, Taiwan; Tokyo, Japan; and India. He also assisted in the planning and creation of another office in Brazil.
Bailey is also currently orchestrating USC’s 2013 Global Conference in Seoul, South Korea.
Before coming to USC, Bailey served as a Kaplan Inc. executive in Latin America and a president for Kaplan International Colleges.
He also served on an advisory committee of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
His education included both an undergraduate degree and masters degree in marine science from the University of Miami.
Bailey also earned a master’s of business administration from the University of Virginia’s Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, as well as doctorate in higher education management from the University of Pennsylvania.

In November, California voters will have the opportunity to choose between two seemingly similar measures, Proposition 30 and Proposition 38, in order to raise revenue for the state’s public schools.
Though both propositions include tax increases as a means to increase education funding, their supporters have opposing views about which is the most effective tax to implement. As a result, support for each bill to generally be mutually exclusive.
Prop. 30 would increase the sales tax rate by one-quarter cent per dollar for four years and the personal income tax rate for individuals with incomes of over $250,000 for seven years. Prop. 38 would increase personal income taxes at a marginal rate of 0.4 percent at low-income levels and increase in steps to a marginal rate of 2.2 percent for individual taxable incomes above $2.5 million.
“We are in a tough situation here because the state is facing such a huge deficit and we are just so broke,” said Tania Mercado, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development. “But I honestly believe we have lacked responsible administrators and elected people that have failed to allocate our limited resources wisely.”
The 2012-13 California budget increased K-12 education funding by $6.6 billion to $53.5 billion, a move that assumes an increase in state revenue.
“Virtually all of this increase is contingent on the passage of Proposition 30, Gov. Brown’s proposal, which establishes temporary tax increases to fund schools and balance the state budget,” said Dr. Lawrence Picus, vice dean for faculty affairs at the Rossier School of Education, in a statement. “Proposition 38, authored by advocate Molly Munger, which temporarily raises taxes but places limits on how the money can be used, will also appear on the ballot in November.”
The primary purpose of Prop. 30 is to raise approximately $6 billion annually and balance the California budget. Brown proposed the measure as an initiated constitutional amendment.
“If Prop. 30 fails, trigger cuts enacted in the budget would reduce funding by nearly $6 billion, most of it falling on education,” Picus said. “Schools and community colleges would lose $5.35 billion midyear, while both the UC and CSU systems would see their revenues reduced by $250 million each. The remaining reductions, which are comparatively small, would come from other state services.”
Prop. 30 is currently outperforming Prop. 38 in the polls, and many analysts predict it is unlikely that Prop. 38 passes and Prop. 30 fails, as Prop. 30 offers a lower tax increase. It is more likely that Prop. 30 will pass and Prop. 38 will fail, both propositions will fail, or both propositions will pass. The state constitution specifies that if two conflicting measures on the same ballot pass, the one that received more votes would prevail.
“If both measures fail, approximately $5.5 billion in scheduled cuts, mostly from education, would take place,” said Dr. Morgan Polikoff, assistant professor of education at Rossier. “These cuts would probably include teacher layoffs and furlough days, among other things. The cuts would be very severe on top of the already sustained cuts that have faced California schools in the past few years.”
Because of the severity of budget cuts schools have already seen, Polikoff recommended that voters look favorably on the propositions.
“What I would say about the two measures is that folks who care about school funding should absolutely vote yes on 30,” Polikoff said. “Whether they also want to vote yes on 38 is another choice.”
Regardless of which measure voters choose, many students felt that at least one needed to pass.
“Cutting funding to education should never be an issue because education is key to everything: to the economy, to healthcare, to technology and innovation,” Mercado said. “It’s a terrible mistake what we have allowed to happen within our state. It’s irresponsible and it’s a shame.”
Tania Mercado is right; our elected officials have given our tax dollars to special interests instead of serving our citizens. And now Prop 38 will solve their problems by handing them buckets of our wages, and allowing them to continue overspending everywhere else. Prop 38 will cost a married couple earning $90K per year over $1000 in added taxes per year. If you’re a couple living in high-cost LA, paying for child care, that’s a big burden!
The better approach is hold your California assembly officials accountable – the only thing they’ll really respond to is being turned out of office for failing to fund CA schools adequately.
Yes on 38, Yes on 30, Yes on 39.

The LGBT Resource Center and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly set a new record by gathering 1,155 signatures for the 2012 OUTlist, a collection of names who support the LGBT community. The list was published Thursday, which is also National Coming Out Day.

Students and members of the university community signed the OUTlist either in person or online, according to Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center. Vigil cites the introduction of the online component several years ago as one of the factors that assisted the list in its burgeoning popularity.
“Support for the list and for the LGBT community has been increasing every year, especially after the opportunity to sign the OUTlist online arose,” Vigil said.
The OUTlist dates back to 1990, when it was founded by an organization known as “University United” to combat homophobia. In its first year, 30 people added their signatures to the list. Recently, however, there has been a substantial increase in signatures.
“Last year was the first year we had a little over 1,000 signatures, and this year we have topped that number,” said Mellissa Linton, executive director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly. “Each year the OUTlist appears to be growing more, and I hope this means more awareness of our community will be present because of our increasing visibility on campus.”
The substantial increase in signatures in 2012 marks the list’s growing popularity among students and greater acceptance given to members and allies of the LGBTQ community on campus, organizers said.
Tyler Coble, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, feels that the OUTlist reflects positive changes in the USC community.
“USC has plenty of groups that make it OK to come out. So many people on campus are so accepting, it just creates a positive environment for everyone,” she said.
Leaders like Linton and Vigil noted that support for the OUTlist has changed over the years. Though many students now gather to compose the list, the project was not always as widely received.
“At first, until about 2005, some allies were fearful that they would be perceived as LGBT if they signed the list,” Vigil said.
As a result, the Resource Center and QuASA have taken measures to ensure that allies and LGBTQ students both feel comfortable showing their support via the list.
“We promote allies in our [public relations], and we make sure to show that allies are included,” Vigil said.
Other changes to the list occurred in 2009 when the OUTlist altered its aim to declare support for equal rights and same sex marriage. With the intention of advocating a repeal of Proposition 8, an initiative that passed in the 2008 election banning same-sex marriage, the list served as a Marriage Equality Declaration, according to the LGBTQ Resource Center’s website.
The unprecedented amount of support the 2012 OUTlist received marks an important milestone in LGBTQ progress on campus.
“The OUTlist is significant because it is a matter of visibility for LGBTQ identified students, faculty, staff, alumni and allies,” Linton said. “Coming Out Month is a month for my community to celebrate our identities, so having the OUTlist is exciting because so many people will see the published list.”
Still, campus LGBTQ leaders would like to see the list and other campus events evolve. Ideas for growing LGBT activities and USC’s National Coming Out Day events include incorporating an element of LGBTQ civil rights history into programs.
“We have a rich history of civil rights and we’d like to educate young people about the movement to demonstrate that it wasn’t always easy and still isn’t easy for LGBT individuals today,” Vigil said.
Linton also said there is still a lot of work to be done to encourage students to be more accepting.
“USC is by no means completely up to par with creating a safe space for LGBTQ students, but it’s on its way, and I hope with a combination of visibility and education, we can collectively move to make USC a good environment for all of us,” Linton said.
Caitlin Wilhelm, a sophomore majoring in linguistics and Middle Eastern studies, is especially impressed with the increased attention given to the official Coming Out Day because of the OUTlist.
“I think it’s a cool experience to have such an open community at USC,” she said. “It’s great to know that people actually know about and support Coming Out Day as a legitimate event on campus.”
I suppose, as long as they’ll lay out the outlandish tuition rates, USC can mamorialize LGB….whatever.  When I attended USC at $14 a unit as a freshman, and later at $28 a unit as a Korean vetran, we had similar studies.  It was called Abnormal Psychology 101.
Fight On!

I’m glad they improved raised the admission standards and increased the diversity of students to weed out the simple minded!
You can view the complete list at http://www.usc.edu/outlist
Why the heck did the DT print the out list in light ink that printed so horribly?  Cannot even see the names of those that came out, as if you put them back ‘in’ the closet.  Genius work, there DT.
Congratulations!  I’m very impressed with your results!

The Planning and Land Use Management Committee approved an amended proposal for renovating the University Village during a meeting at Los Angeles City Hall on Wednesday. The proposal will now go to a vote before the entire City Council before it can receive final approval.
Redevelopment · The proposed Specific Plan would tear down the University Village and install chain retail stores and student housing in its place as The Village. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
More than 200 stakeholders attended the meeting, most of whom were in support of USC’s $1 billion plan to create new retail space and student housing in the University Village.
The vote followed an agreement between USC and the city that the university pay up to $20 million for affordable housing. The university originally allocated $2 million, but has increased the figure during months of negotiations, according to a report from the city’s chief legislative analyst.
The university also agreed to build 3,000 new beds and create a counseling service within the Gould School of Law for residents with tenant-landlord conflicts. The agreement also contained a 30 percent local hiring goal for permanent University Village jobs.
Committee members include Councilman Mitch Englander, Councilman Ed Reyes and Councilman Jose Huizar, who was absent Wednesday. Reyes said USC’s cooperation led to approval in a 2-0 vote.
“Thank you to the people at USC for your due diligence and responding to our concerns,” Reyes said.
David Galaviz, executive director for USC local government relations, said the decision will benefit both USC and the surrounding community.
“This is a win-win, not only for the university and the city, but, in our view, also for USC students and the community,” Galaviz said. “This is new jobs, new retail and new housing that currently does not exist.”
If the City Council approves the plan, Galaviz said crews might begin tearing down the University Village next May. Construction, which is expected to take about two years, would begin shortly after.
Kristina Raspe, USC’s vice president of real estate development and asset management, said the university will still need to work with a full-project architect and get approval from the Board of Trustees before the tear-down process begins.
“There’s still quite a bit of work to do before you’d see any movement on the site,” Raspe said. “But having a green light from the City Council would allow us to move forward with the work and complete it as soon as possible.”
Representatives from several unions expressed support for the project because the university said it plans to use contractors who hire union members.
James Irwin, a field representative for the Painters and Allied Trades International Union, applauded the plan for including benefits for its workers.
“Our members and their families are going to gain a lot because it supports their families through benefits and medical and good wages,” Irwin said.
About a dozen business owners who currently work in the University Village, however, voiced concerns over the future of their businesses.
Wendy’s franchise owner Ketan Sharma, who employs 35 people, said the current proposal fails to adequately address concerns over the future of his business, which he has owned for 22 years.
“Sixty percent of my business is drive-thru, but USC has not guaranteed I can keep it,” Sharma said. “The only guarantee is that they will talk before demolition — the first right of refusal as it is has no teeth in it. This keeps me awake at night.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos said USG supports the overall plan as it stands, but has certain specific interests related to the Village. His administration plans to push for maximizing green space, increasing the square footage of the proposed gym and ensuring business owners’ concerns are addressed.
Geragos also said USG will pay attention to the type of tenants that are put in the Village.
“We’re very strongly in support of the idea of mixed markets for retail,” Geragos said. “It’s not only for community members, but because students are diverse in their ability to afford certain things.”
Galaviz expects to vote on the plan in November.
Though USC communicates with the city frequently, the university does not plan to change anything in the proposal before the vote, Galaviz said.
“We are not planning to renegotiate anything that’s already been negotiated,” Galaviz said. “Our goal is what is passed out of PLUM is passed out of the City Council.”
I just want them to maximize student housing…3,000 is not close to enough in my opinion.  We’re far behind what other schools can offer and need to maximize this opportunity to make huge gains in this area.
Where will I buy my chicken feet?
I am very proud of my alma mater for bringing progress to my fellow Trojans, my family still living in the area, our neighbors children and more dollars to the hurting city economy.  If a few handful of people are still not on board, I am sure they will get the help they deserve. All differences can be solved when people sit at a table and have a respectful and constructive dialogue and USC has proved that they can certainly do that. When I was a student, I was very actively involved with the internal and external SC community, so I attended many of USC open forums where they informed the community about this project, so that’s why I know why this is such a one-of-a-kind opportunity for everyone living or working around here. In despite of the negative criticism from some activists, USC has rebuilt a strong and good working relationship with their neighbors and you can just see the big difference not only in the school but in all the local schools and nonprofits that receive money from USC to fund their after-school programs.
At this point of the game, it looks like there is only one last step to make this happen. There are thousands of jobs that will be open right here in our backyard, meaning our families can have an opportunity to get decent salaries, health benefits, you name it. With so many people unemployed and underemployed, I just wish this happens as soon as possible. We will ALL have a decent place to shop (not the run-down Village that we have right now) and the students will have 3000 more beds so they can start leaving apartments empty in the area and at the same time, student will be able to move into SAFER conditions…This is a huge step! Go USC!! Fight ON!

I hated middle school. I hated high school. Many days I thought, “There has to be more to life than this.”
I know I’m not alone when I say that those years could best be described as Hell on earth. But even the chubbiest, most awkward-looking black girl with blue braces probably doesn’t go through the same things as someone who is struggling with their sexual orientation.
For some, coming out can be as easy as 1-2-3. For others, coming out is pure and absolute torture. I have a friend whose parents simply said “Oh sweetie, we know,” and then went back to making dinner. I have another friend whose mother threatened to stop paying college tuition.
This shouldn’t even be an issue. In an ideal world, all would be able to love whomever they want to love, without ridicule.
Yes, gay marriage has become one of the most-talked about issues in our generation. Yes, gay students want to debate and advocate for laws protecting them and their civil rights. But mostly, gay college students just want to be students.
You know, the kind of student without a spotlight pointed at them. A student who isn’t the “gay friend.” A student who can go out, go to class and just be their generally awesome self. And yes, the student who also dates.
The dating scene at ’SC can be a bit rough — add in the factor of trying to figure out if the person you’re interested in swings a certain way, and the dating situation gets a lot more difficult.
The number of times that I have sat with a gay friend trying to figure out if a girl is a lesbian or a guy is gay is too high to count. Being rejected sucks, but when it’s accompanied by an “Oh, I’m not …” it sucks even more.
But what do you do when you’re not even out yet? How do you function when you feel like you want to scream all the time?
I’m not going to pretend to know what it feels like, since I have no idea what millions of people go through every day. Just like someone who isn’t black can’t tell me what it’s like, I can’t tell a gay person, “Just come out already, it’ll be fine!”
Yet I’ve seen firsthand how such a secret can destroy a life. I’ve seen friends who seemed almost dead inside, self-destructive to the core. Then a light switch on in their eyes when they come to terms with themselves.
Some don’t want to risk coming out to their fraternity brothers, some don’t want to see a look of disappointment on their parents’ faces and some feel like their relationships with certain people will never be the same.
Some even hook up with the “right” gender in order to try and force themselves to be straight.
“I was hoping that if I hooked up with a girl enough it wouldn’t only make me appear straight to outside people, but it may ‘make’ me straight in my own head,” said a long-closeted friend of mine. “That strategy only helped so long and then my situation just kept getting worse until I realized there’s nothing wrong with being who I actually am and having people know.”
Today is National Coming Out Day. Today is a day we should ask ourselves if we’re treating every person with the respect, honor and love they deserve. Today is a day many kids feeling hopeless will hopefully find a way to become one with themselves. Today is a day when even adults might be able to look in the mirror and come to terms with the person reflected back at them.
You can’t be ashamed of who you are. You can’t make yourself different. We were all put on this earth for specific reasons, for specific paths — the second you start doubting yourself is the second the naysayers win. Though there are some that want to deny you your freedom, we all will continue to fight. I, like many others, will stand by you until we’re at the altar, and you get to declare your love in front of whomever you g-ddamn want to.
For now, try and figure out the best way for you to come out. Maybe you start with a close friend, maybe your sibling can help. There’s no rulebook and no script to follow.
Just remember that at our core we are the Trojan Family. Though it might seem dark, though it might seem rocky, you’ll get through this because you’re a Trojan. You fight till the end, and you stand up for yourself and what you believe in. You don’t run away when all seems lost.
You fight on.

Every season, fashion designers are hard-pressed to discover enticing trends and pull them together into a show that will impress shoppers, critics, magazine editors and wholesale buyers.
In 2012’s Fashion Week, there were, of course, common threads between the collections in New York, London, Milan and Paris. The real turn-on, however, came from the versatility afforded by the separates and classics. Flowing silks and luxe layers transition easily from season to season and day to night, while perfectly complementing an existing wardrobe.
Here are the top trends, straight from the runways.
Black and White
With checkered, spray-painted, striped and color-blocked varieties, the “it” colors of next spring — black and white — are not really colors at all. Nearly every show exhibited some variety of these pairings, whether it came in the form of whimsical floral stencil paintings on Prada’s silk dresses and tops or as ladylike lace at Thakoon. Michael Kors made these monochromatic shades an addition to his classic American style with sleek black cutout dresses and preppy striped knits, while Karl Lagerfeld stayed true to Chanel’s heritage with clean lines and bold contrasting trims.
There is no wrong way to wear this trend for spring. A solid black top with a pair of white jeans will be as on-trend as it is simple.
Slightly Exposed
Even the most ladylike designers proved that (a little) skin is definitely in. Following in the footsteps of the cutout trend that emerged several seasons ago, American favorites like Peter Som made belly baring tasteful with ultra high-waisted, voluminous skirts and tiny tops that left just a sliver of midriff visible.
Balance is essential, as exemplified by Derek Lam, who paired a tough leather corset top with a plaid below-the-knee pencil skirt that would remain stylish in the spring or fall. Others blurred the line between clothing and lingerie with strappy bandeau tops made of sheer mesh or lace overlay. Though there is a distinction between traditional undergarments and those shown alone, it’s clear the bra is no longer simply a foundation piece meant to be concealed.
Laser-Cut Leather
Exquisitely detailed leather adds a richer side to fashion pieces in the months transitioning out of cold weather by lightening the traditionally heavy motorcycle jacket or trenchcoat. One standout piece can bring just the right amount of feminine interest to an entire outfit, and there was certainly no lack of girly whimsy at this month of shows. J. Mendel and Valentino worked blush and white leather into delicate, scallop-edged lace shorts topped with playful swing jackets. Never one to shy away from excess, Roberto Cavalli incised elaborate designs along the front and back panels of classic trousers, as well as on the bib collar of button-down blouses.
Aquamarine
Last year’s sugary pastels made way for an equally appealing, but slightly less saccharine, palette of seafoam green, dusty blue and muted turquoise. Paired with pleats, drapes and languid silks, these colors are beachy finds much too beautiful to dirty with sand. Caribbean-inspired shades covered everything from easy, breezy voluminous pants to Grecian sundresses given an effortlessness with unfinished or uneven hemlines, as seen at Blumarine. Jill Stuart made the trend applicable to the New York girl by pairing an ankle-length frock with black platform sandals and sleek hair. At Donna Karan, the collection played out like a day on the coast, opening with soft oceanic hues followed by darker blues and a full range of sunset colors.
Drop Waists
The predominant silhouette of the season gives a subtle nod to the ’20s with its carefree attitude and torso-lengthening effect. Prabal Gurung modernized the shape by adding pockets to a shimmery strapless piece. Dries van Noten adopted the trend by letting skirts fall lower on the hips, as opposed to at waist level. The result is a relaxed vibe that translates with any skirt length and can even be adopted by slinging pants a little lower, as seen at See by Chloe.
Trends, like rules, are meant to be played with and broken. So until the next round of shows, take joy in deciding how to fit one or all of these trends into the puzzle that is your closet.

Macklemore and his producer Ryan Lewis have been everywhere these days, releasing hit songs, touring and building up a devoted fanbase. All the work and waiting has culminated in The Heist, an unbelievably poignant full-length album debut.
Hailing from Seattle, Macklemore, real name Ben Haggerty, began his career in 2000 when he self-recorded and distributed the EP Open Your Eyes. In January 2005, Macklemore released his the solo album, The Language of My World.
From 2005 to 2008, Macklemore’s substance abuse effectively stunted his musical production. By 2009, the newly sober, Macklemore teamed up with producer Ryan Lewis to release The Unplanned Mixtape as well as a few other EPs.
Now signed with The Agency Group, the collaborators have outdone themselves with The Heist. The album contains 18 tracks,  11 of which feature contributions from other up-and-coming artists -— and every song deserves to be a single.
Impressively, “Ten Thousand Hours,” the first track on The Heist, is a relatively simple recounting of Macklemore’s young rise to fame. The “Ten Thousand Hours” theory, first mentioned in the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, suggests that in order to be successful at something, an individual must put in at least 10,000 hours of work. Macklemore believes “Put those hours in and look at what you get / Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is.”
Several tracks deal with Macklemore’s devotion to music and his journey to getting where he is today, including “Can’t Hold Us (feat. Ray Dalton).” The track was released digitally about a year ago and features spitfire rapping on top of fast beats and trumpets with a chanting, gospel-inspired chorus. The song is a rush, propelling itself forward, mixing genres and recalling the euphoria of doing what you love and receiving love for it in return.
While The Heist runs the gamut on serious topics, Macklemore knows how to have fun. “Thrift Shop (feat. Wanz)” discusses Macklemore’s shopping habits — which include buying broken keyboards — as he mocks people who spend fortunes on brand-name apparel. “Gold (feat. Eighty4 Fly)” sounds like something that would play on Top 40 radio countdowns. The track, with its light and sweet chorus, packs less of a punch than others, but serves as a sweet antidote to the bitter lyrics elsewhere on the album.
“Castle,” which appears near the end of the album, also reminds listeners that life is not a constant struggle. Similar to “And We Danced,” it contains a chorus pertaining to “unicorns and wizard sleeves.” Such tracks showcase Macklemore as an artist that can comfortably shift between irreverent lyrics and relevant themes.
“Same Love” has already become one of the better-known songs on The Heist, both for the track’s excellent musicality and its support of marriage equality. The track attacks America’s oppressive heteronormative ideals. Macklemore shows he is unafraid to make his art political in “Wing$,” a previously released track warning against consumerist culture, and “A Wake (feat. Evan Roman),” a hit-list of societal issues.
The most memorable and powerful songs, however, remain the ones that critique society and chronicle very personal inner battles with demons.
Macklemore has penned several songs dealing with his substance abuse. “Neon Cathedral” features a heavy beat and a slow bluesy melody with Macklemore rhyming religious metaphors with drug addiction. “White Walls” describes Macklemore’s car and the drug-infused hazy days spent living inside it.
“BomBom (feat. The Teaching)” is entirely instrumental. Consisting of classical piano, tribal chanting, drumming and horns, the track sits right between the darkest songs on the album, offering a brief catharsis before diving back in.
In “Starting Over (feat. Ben Bridwell),” the album’s darkest song, Macklemore confesses to relapsing with cough syrup. He apologizes to those he inspired to get clean on his track “Otherside,” but doesn’t apologize for being human, making mistakes or start over.
The line, “If I can be an example of getting sober / Then I can be an example of starting over,” sums up the power of Macklemore’s music.
Macklemore isn’t just another rapper. He resonates with listeners and inspires with songs still red and raw from his scars. The Heist is a brilliant hip-hop record: Each track is standout. If you listen to only one album this month, make it this one.

Patti Smith
Friday, Oct. 12 at 8 p.m.
The Wiltern
Since the 1978 release of her landmark album Easter, Patti Smith has exhibited photography, published poetry and released a highly acclaimed memoir, Just Kids.
On Friday night, though, the multi-talented Smith puts on her (wide-brimmed) musician hat once more for a performance of her latest album Banga.
Smith, now 65 years old, still rocks harder than today’s youngest punk artists. And her lyrics are all the more poetic, too. At the very least, the evening promises to inspire.

An Evening of Vinyl with Suzanne Kraft 
Thursday, Oct. 11  at
9:00 p.m.
Tommy’s Place
Even for those unfamiliar with Suzanne Kraft’s modernized disco stylings, taking a break from Top 40 hits to explore some native L.A. music can provide fresh perspectives on the city’s culture.
Kraft’s Thursday night performance, co-sponsored by KXSC and USC Spectrum, will feature heavy synth melodies tinged with a hint of retro flavor and popular tracks from Horoscope, the artist’s Sept. 4 vinyl release. Be sure to pay attention to the way Kraft effortlessly mixes up and slows down his original beats. Kraft just debuted on the music scene a year ago, but it’s clear that he knows what he’s doing.
Opening acts from Young Adults and Jazner should also entertain, making Thursday night a pleasant mix of unique performances from up-and-coming disco artists.
Need another incentive? Attending “An Evening of Vinyl” requires little effort to attend. The concert has free admission and takes place at the popular ’SC hangout, Tommy’s Place. Just make sure to RSVP on USC Spectrum’s site before biking over.

For fans of the electronic instrumentals and lilting voice behind the major dance hit “Lights” — with or without the Bassnectar remix — British import Ellie Goulding is back with a new sound in her sophomore studio album Halcyon.
Signed in 2009 to Polydor Records, Goulding’s first single “Under the Sheets” reached number 53 on the U.K. Singles Chart. After releasing two other digital singles, “Guns and Horses” and “Wish I Stayed,” Goulding began to garner major industry attention.
Heartbreak on Halcyon · Though Goulding fans will appreciate dance tracks like “Figure 8,” much of Halcyon features slower tunes. – | Photo courtesy of Polydor Ltd.
In 2010 Goulding won the Critic’s Choice Award at the BRIT Awards, which led to Goulding’s debut and U.K. number one album Lights. Later that year, Goulding re-released Lights as Bright Lights with six new tracks, one of which was “Your Song,” a cover of an Elton John song that Goulding would perform at Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding reception.
Ever since the release of Lights, listeners have been enraptured by Goulding’s hauntingly complex musicality. Both of the album’s singles, “Starry Eyed” and “Lights,” are built upon relatively simple narratives filled out with soaring vocals and ferocious electro-dance beats. The single “Lights” has sold 3 million copies in the United States, spent two weeks as number one song on the Top 40 radio charts and was ranked in the top 10 songs on Billboard’s Hot 100.
Now, more than a year later and after riding the ups and downs of fame, Goulding returns with an album that reflects the maturation of her emotions since Lights. Halcyon, ruminating on heartbreak and desolation, very closely resembles the truly aching, tentative and tumultuous journey to joy.
“Anything Could Happen,” Halcyon’s first single, represents classic Goulding. Reminiscent of the hook-driven, powerhouse singles of Lights, “Anything Could Happen” creates an emotional rollercoaster of euphoria tinged by uncertainty and doubt. A pounding beat buoys the insistent chants of “Anything could happen” and “I know it’s gonna be” in Goulding’s signature soprano, propulsing the song to a climactic finish à la “Lights.” This single has the makings of a Goulding dance hit — one of the few tracks on this album that echoes the electronic style on Lights.
Besides “Anything Could Happen,” fans of Goulding will enjoy “Figure 8,” as it is the most electronic song on the album. Starting slow, it delves into full dubstep soon after. “Figure 8,” however, is missing the playfulness of “Starry Eyed” and “Lights.” The massive amount of radio play that propelled “Lights” to number one seems unlikely for “Figure 8.”
One of the first songs to be released from Halcyon, “Hanging On,” features Tinie Tempah, an artist Goulding has worked with before. The track is a cover of an Active Child song and cleverly combines electronic, dance and dubstep into a musical masterpiece that emphasizes Goulding’s effervescent singing. Here, Goulding’s vocals save a song dominated by Tinie Tempah’s jarring rapping.
The namesake of the album, “Halcyon,” slows things down. The track lacks Goulding’s signature driving beats, instead focusing on her hushed, soft-spoken vocals. “Joy” is another slow ballad, lovingly sung with a choir in the background. Both beautifully constructed songs show just how much Goulding has matured since Lights.
“I Know You Care,” provides another slow and somber number. The track will likely remind listeners of “Your Song” from Lights: The track is stripped of all dance-music production, spotlighting Goulding’s melancholic voice against a piano melody. “I Know You Care” shies away from bells or whistles, achieving a breathtaking simplicity.
Halcyon offers much for both old and new fans of Goulding, even though some tracks aren’t as innovative as others. “Atlantis,” for example, is a forgettable track that faces an identity crisis between simplicity and over-production. In addition, the first track on Halcyon, “Don’t Say a Word,” seems bland for an opening song despite a throbbing drum beat that drives the melody. The track seems to serve solely as an introduction to other, more substantial songs.
“My Blood,” “Explosions” and “Only You” all follow the same pattern: pulsing beats layered with synthesizers and Goulding’s cascading vocal symphonies. This formula works, however, as all three songs will likely become hits. Though these tracks don’t resemble Goulding’s previous singles, they remain catchy and affecting.
Halcyon closes with “Dead in the Water.” This track ends a album on the devastating note describing a woman searching for her lover who has died in the ocean. Though the song remains stark and riveting, the track lacks replay value. The song appears to work more for Goulding’s growth as an artist than for popular enjoyment.
Goulding’s sophomore album doesn’t focus on  the party-playing tracks and seems more emotionally compatible with deeper heartbreak fare. As Goulding has grown and changed, her sound has matured and darkened.
But, as the album’s listeners will soon realize, this isn’t necessarily a negative change. Halcyon’s break-up style flaunts Goulding’s versatility, making the album a somber complement to the upbeat Lights.
In this case, the artist’s lyrics might reflect losses, but the listener certainly gains.

The front page of The New York Times on Monday featured the article “The Patent, Used as a Sword.” The article recounts the story of a small company, Vlingo, that was planning to release its speech-recognition software when technology and communications powerhouse Nuance filed a lawsuit against them, claiming the company infringed on Nuance’s patent. By the time Vlingo won the lawsuit six years later, it had already lost $3 million and had no choice but to sell itself to Nuance. What was originally Vlingo’s speech-recognition software is now essentially a household name: Siri.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Vlingo’s story reveals how the United States’ broken patent system allows for big corporations to monopolize markets and beat out smaller companies. The system squelches the innovation and small business emphasis that the country — and students, as the entrepreneurs and start-up founders of the future — desperately needs to protect.
The United States’ patent system is laden with loopholes that large corporations can use to gain a competitive industry advantage, such as claiming the rights to many broad, undefined inventions. With the America Invents Act that President Barack Obama signed into law last year, the company that is “first to file” a patent claims legal ownership of an idea. This creates an inherent disadvantage for small businesses: Applying for patents entails spending thousands of dollars. Big businesses have the resources to apply for hundreds, even thousands, of patents, while smaller businesses, such as start-ups or grassroots student projects, are left in the dust.
The number of corporate-owned patents continues to surpass those held by individual inventors.  In 2011, U.S. corporations accounted for 99,527 of the 108,626 patents of U.S. origin, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Obtaining a patent ultimately becomes a game of semantics and legal loopholes with a hefty price tag. The policies currently in place prevent most students without the financial means from starting their own business or taking that crazy idea for a product and turning it into something tangible.
In order to reform the patent system, the patent office staff should be retrained under a new standard for approving patented ideas. This standard should include a limit on how many times an applicant can file a proposal for the same idea. More importantly, the system must establish a cap on the number of patents obtained by one company within a specified time period.
This will have multiple benefits: It will force companies to apply with discretion, limit larger companies’ legal and business power, decrease unnecessary stress on patent examiners and, most importantly, give small businesses and young entrepreneurs the chance they deserve to secure patents. Such regulations, as well as stronger leadership, should be put in place by whoever is elected come Nov. 6.
Though it might not seem so at first glance, the patent system should be an important election issue in a year dominated by discussion of the 99 and 1 percents. Big corporations’ uses of patents to expand their market power reflects the deep divide between America’s underrepresented 99 percent and the affluent 1 percent — the wealthy continues to benefit at the cost of the less fortunate. Patent system reform would be a step toward closing that gap.
Some might say that motivated small companies will eventually flourish in the long-term. But with an unequal distribution of wealth and resources, it is nearly impossible for small-scale innovators to compete without the protection of their intellectual property rights.
The corrupt patent system discourages students from entering the increasingly competitive technology market. In other situations, such as in Vlingo’s case, they will be forced to exit the market and sell off to a large corporation once they’ve lost all their money —  which could have been devoted to creative innovation — to the black hole of patent lawsuits. With the decrease of innovation in small businesses, the nation will not create the new industries needed to spur much-needed productivity and employment growth.
Additionally, foreign competitors are rising in the technological world and attracting American businesses. Companies are moving abroad to Beijing and fostering cutting-edge research.
Let’s face it. America is no longer the great nation of innovation it used to be. And corporations’ abuses of patents are certainly not helping the nation nor students who believe in the existence of a business environment so innovative that a website created by a college student can eventually turn into Facebook. The flaws of the patent system impact students directly and deserve our attention, now more than ever.

Westinghouse and Tesla had numerous inventions and royalties between them. Westinghouse once told tesla, I cannot afford your royalties anymore, they are going to bankrupt the company. So Tesla ripped up the royalty contracts and said, problem resolved, lets move on to the next project.
Maybe not in those exact words, but I personally have an invention, and filling the provisional application, is for lack of a better description, ” an inefficient waste of time and energy”
the thing I invented was easier to create, have a prototype built, and use it.
I hope to find help submitting the provisional app, sell the design/product to an investor or aftermarket company, so I may move on to the next project!
All I have to ask is this: When did Our government officials become so greedy, follow the dollar bills, we’ll how is that working out for ya’s.
God Bless the USA,
The TV show “Sharktank” covered this. Even if it’s reality TV, it did provide some succinct insight into intellectual property laws. Essentially, a patent gives one party the right to sue the other party that infringes upon it. There is no guarantee that the other party, even if they lose in court, will be enforced to follow the ruling. You may win the case, sue for civil damages…but the “sharks” used the hackneyed cliche, “good luck collecting.”
Interesting article. The whole idea of intangible property was flawed from the start. The obvious problem with the system is that it gives patent holders the right to infringe upon the freedom of others. That’s a road that is sure to lead to monopolies and abuse of power. It is possible to have a system that promotes innovation and compensate inventors for their hard work in a way that does not infringe on the liberty of others. We need something like the following:
1. A special independent fund must be set aside to compensate inventors for their inventions and reward innovation.
2. A retroactive formula must be adopted to calculate the amount of the compensation.
3. The formula must be adjustable so as to establish the best return for society at large in terms of innovations.
4. Last but not least, whatever the formula chosen, it must never infringe on the right of the individual to copy and use any invention for whatever purpose.
Inventors should register and publish their findings as soon as they can because their compensation will depend on how much society like and use their ideas. Of course, we still need a Patent bureau and a system to manage claims and the proper registrations of inventions. The system should be as automated as possible.

Paul Ryan will repeat debate success
“You’re telling me we have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt? The answer is yes, that’s what I’m telling you.”
Vice President Joe Biden’s statement epitomizes why the American people are rejecting four more years of an Obama presidency.
In a substantial debate devoid of personal attacks, President Barack Obama and Biden can’t keep up. Representative Paul Ryan, like Romney, will be quick on his feet, compassionate and professional. He will look poised and confident and show his strengths as a master of policy and data. Ryan will point to the failures of trickle-down government and the immorality of massive deficits, while laying out a strong philosophical vision of fiscal responsibility.
By all measures, the Obama campaign has handed Biden an impossible task. With polls showing Romney in the lead after a disastrous debate by Obama, Biden will do his best to frame Ryan as a heartless politician. He will continue to utilize tired “Mediscare” tactics, while ignoring the fact that the president cut $716 billion out of Medicare to fund Obamacare.
Even through it all, Republicans like me love Joe Biden. We agree with him when he said “the middle class has been buried in this country.” We are excited to see Ryan run circles around Biden the same way Romney did against Obama. We don’t need Al Gore telling us why Biden was ineffective; the president’s record speaks for itself.

Joe Biden will speak to American people
Anyone who has picked up a newspaper recently has seen a story predicting that Vice President Joe Biden will be drubbed in his primetime matchup with Representative Paul Ryan on Thursday.
After all, Ryan is the wonky, “budget-hawk” with a cult following among conservatives, and Biden is the gaffe-prone sidekick of a commander-in-chief presiding over a bad economy.
Most analysts won’t hesitate to pick Ryan to win this week’s debate. But if you dig down past the media spin and the echo chamber that has engulfed the national political scene, you’ll see that Biden is well positioned to win this debate and seal a second term for President Barack Obama.
Romney has experienced a surge in the polls in the wake of last week’s debate because he has fooled people into thinking he’s a moderate. He has lied about tax policy, misled the elderly about his Medicare plans, taken back his contemptuous comments about 47 percent of America and now he’s somehow tricked people into thinking he’s a centrist, bipartisan dealmaker.
Nothing poses a bigger risk to this carefully cultivated narrative more than the contrast between the ideological Ryan, who wants to balance the budget on the backs of the poor, and Biden, the former working-class Senator, who has never had an issue empathizing with people who have fallen on tough times. Biden might not always know the right words to say (or not to say), but on Thursday night he’ll be the only one on stage speaking a language that resonates with the American people.

Oh, and the quotation cited in the first letter is completely right. It’s called ‘The Paradox of Thrift’ and is worth googling (as well as the allegory of the DC Babysitting Co-Op that shows why it works).
Looks like, judging from these two letters, we can score one for Chris. Not only due to its higher predictive accuracy but the first letter is rather disappointing in its reliance on tired political cliches and talking points. You are an undergraduate student, Alex. Think for yourself. Don’t just repeat lines.
i think obama can win, but this guy from australia predicts these kind of political events, and is eery accurate, see what he says who will win the current US election http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac4LnNrVtic   very interesting.

The field of journalism is changing rapidly, with social media and the Internet revolutionizing the very nature of the industry.
Amid these changes, local and regional newspapers have had to significantly restructure their models to succeed in an increasingly digital world — whether that means going online completely, covering more cities than they’re capable of or increasing coverage to include more national and international news. These changes can be detrimental to the valuable institution that is the local newspaper. Local newspapers should instead become hyperlocal media that focus exclusively on small communities.
Xingzhu Zhou | Daily Trojan
Take, for example, a collection of local newspapers in Britain called the Tindle Newspaper Group. By focusing exclusively on smaller regions, Tindle Group newspapers have integrated themselves into their respective communities. Rather than being a separate, larger entity that reports on numerous towns, Tindle Group newspapers act as an inherent part of the local community that is in touch with and serves local interests and needs.
Sir Ray Tindle, owner of the Tindle Group, applied this ultra-local strategy to his failing South London Press in June. Three weeks later, sales for the company were up 44 percent. Clearly, there is a huge demand for local news, but business models of the past no longer function in today’s world and must also be re-thought.
Local newspapers have traditionally earned sizable portions of their revenue — up to 85 percent, in some cases — from local businesses’ advertisements. It was an effective system: Consumers knew they could find the information they needed in local papers, which in turn enjoyed widespread readership. Newspaper advertisements today, however, are at a disadvantage in a world dominated by online shopping. Since 2009, the number of online shoppers increased by more than 20 million and is expected to exceed 200 million by 2015, according to an eMarketer survey. And even if you are getting out of the house to go to the store, when was the last time you looked at a local newspaper instead of Google or Yelp to figure out where to make your purchase?
Publishers need to realize local journalism’s reliance on advertising revenue is no longer sustainable. Instead, they should focus on providing the best local coverage possible while integrating themselves into a technology-based society.
Local journalism doesn’t have to be a collection of mundane and irrelevant stories written by aging members of the community, but it also doesn’t have to try to compete with The New York Times — leave it to them and other publications to cover national and global events. Continuing to publish a print edition will maintain that local newspaper feel, and altering it to provide exclusively local information will make the content something unique that readers can’t find online.
This is not to say there should be a rigid line between local print journalism and online media. Local news publications should use the Internet to their advantage — with Twitter, Facebook, blogs and public forums, hyperlocal publications could make it exceptionally easy for members of the community to be informed of and involved in local events.
Many people simply see a physical newspaper as an inconvenient, trite news source, or might prefer quick updates to lengthy print stories. Combining print and digital strategies would help local papers appeal to a wider audience.
Sad as it might be, there is no longer a need for a publication that tries to focus on both local and national coverage. This approach compromises the quality of local stories, damages a paper’s relationship with its community and creates an unreachable goal of competing with larger publications on national event coverage. Also, the Internet has made it financially impossible for local journalism to continue surviving based on advertising revenue.
That doesn’t mean, however, the personal touch of a local paper has to be lost. In fact, focusing on that aspect while staying up-to-date with technology could make local newspapers news sources unparalleled in their use and relevancy.

The Planning and Land Use Management committee approved Wednesday an amended proposal for renovating the University Village during a meeting at Los Angeles City Hall.
Councilman Ed Reyes, a member of the committee, said USC’s cooperation led to the approval. About 200 stakeholders attended the meeting, most of whom were in support of USC’s $1 billion plan to create new retail space and student housing in the University Village.
The vote followed an agreement between local representatives that USC pay $20 million in benefits to preserve affordable housing. The university originally allocated $2 million but has increased the figure during months of negotiations.
The university also agreed to providing residents priority in the hiring process and creating a counseling service within the Gould School of Law for residents with tenant-landlord conflicts.
Patricia Alarcon, executive assistant for local government relations for USC, said the decision will benefit both USC and the surrounding community.
“It’s wonderful that this is going to move forward because it has been nine years in the making,” Alarcon said. “This is a win-win for USC and the community.”
Several union representatives expressed support for the project because the university said it plans to use contractors who hire union members. About a dozen business owners who currently work in the University Village, however, voiced concerns over the future of their businesses.
Wendy’s franchise owner Ketan Sharma, who employs 35 people, said the current proposal does not adequately address concerns over the future of his business, which he has owned for 22 years.
“Sixty percent of my business is drive-thru, but USC has not guaranteed I can keep it,” Sharma said. “The only guarantee is that they will talk before demolition — the first right of refusal as it is has no teeth in it. This keeps me awake at night.”
Working with local stakeholders has been a priority for the university, Alarcon said.
“USC has from the beginning known that it was important for community members to be present at these discussions,” Alarcon said. “From day one, USC has listened to members of the community and responded to their comments.”

Former Trojan standout linebacker Brian Cushing suffered a torn ACL during a Monday night contest between the Houston Texans and the host New York Jets in East Rutherford, NJ.
Injuries in professional football are certainly commonplace, but Cushing’s injury in particular brings with it a fair amount of scrutiny because it occurred due to a possibly illegal chop block from Jets guard Matt Slauson.
Former USC teammate and current Green Bay Packers star linebacker Clay Matthews took tweeted on behalf of Cushing after watching video of the injury and stated, “If the NFL really wants to increase player safety, start protecting players on BOTH sides of the ball.” The play is currently under review by the NFL.
The Texans released that they believe Cushing has a torn anterior cruciate ligament which will require surgery in a few weeks, effectively ending the linebacker’s 2012 campaign. Cushing’s loss is huge for Houston, as the Trojan product was leading the team in tackles (38) heading into Monday’s game.
Cushing was part of a trio of highly regarded linebackers during his time at USC. He, Matthews and Rey Maualuga appeared on the cover of a 2009 issue of Sports Illustrated after all three were rumored to be first-round selections. Cushing was named an AP All American First-Teamer in 2008 before being drafted 15th overall by the Texans the following year. He was named the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2009.

USC claims a distinct difference between its graduate and undergraduate education programs, the latest example being the announcement Monday of new online degree programs for the former set.
Online degree programs provide graduate students the unique flexibility to advance their education and pursue a career at the same time, allowing them both to more practically afford graduate level education and to get a head start in the professional world.
The university, however, does not have plans to create online programs for undergraduates because, according to senior associate dean of graduate and professional programs at the Viterbi School of Engineering, Kelly Goulis, that’s not what college is about.
“When you’re an undergraduate living on campus, being here and interacting with other students, it provides you with … things that are important as you’re growing and developing into the next stage of your academic career,” Goulis told the Daily Trojan on Monday.
This position, however, seems a classic case of USC-centrism. College isn’t about undergraduate education, really? What about the scores of young adults across the country enrolled in online undergraduate programs at community colleges? What about those high-school students taking e-courses for college credit through programs such as Stanford’s Education Program for Gifted Youth? What about students who work or who cannot afford to live on campus and whom online classes could really benefit?
The sheer number of successful—and necessary—examples of undergraduate education indicates that no institution of higher learning should close the book on it just yet.
Besides, many USC professors and students already engage in a somewhat e-based learning process. Courses feature discussion threads on Blackboard, students turn in their papers through internet programs like Turnitin equipped with anti-plagiarism software, and students with laptops are constantly fact-checking whatever their instructors say in class.
Even face-to-face interaction cannot be considered a deciding factor. There are plenty of students in large lecture classes who never communicate with their professors except through email.
As USC applauds the advantages of its new online degree programs for graduates, perhaps they should consider how these advantages could confer on undergraduates as well.

At the Visions and Voices event, Poetry: A Career?!, poet Kay Ryan read her work aloud and discussed her career with students in the audience on Monday.
Ryan expressed her intention for her poems to be read in silence because of the sacredness of the inner voice that the reader adds to the piece, but for the event Ryan verbally shared her poems with the audience.
As a child, Ryan said she had an easy time getting along with kids at school and did not struggle because she prided herself in being funny. At a young age, she began to consider herself a “word collector” because she would frequently challenge herself to never repeat the same words.
Ryan also started the habit of writing every day. Although she did not see herself associating well with the confessional and overtly sexy poetry of the time, Ryan finally accepted herself as a poet.
As she put it, “everything else failed me except trying to work in words.”
Ryan said she also strived to challenge herself mentally by she flipping through a deck of tarot cards and writing a poem about the image on each card.
Since rain was expected in Los Angeles that day, she read poems that had to do with rain or water. She read many of her poems twice to give the listener the opportunity to understand the meanings behind them.
Ryan spoke about her personal writing process, which takes place in the morning with caffeine and breakfast in bed. Though she often writes poems quickly, Ryan said “it could take 30 minutes to create something but 20 years to find it.”
