The United States Senate blocked a bill today that was intended to provide a path to legalized citizenship for immigrants who come to the country illegally before the age of 16.
Under the DREAM Act, legislation pioneered with bipartisan support by Senators Orin Hatch (R-Utah) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), undocumented youth would have been eligible to receive U.S. citizenship after a six-year long period during which they would be required to complete either a college degree or two years of military service.
Although the House of Representatives passed the bill last week, it was blocked in the Senate after receiving only 55 votes, five short of the 60 needed to bring the bill to the floor for debate, according to the New York Times.
President Obama said he was dissatisfied with the results of the Senate vote.
“It is disappointing that common sense did not prevail today,” President Obama said in a statement. “But my administration will not give up on the Dream Act, or on the important business of fixing our broken immigration system.”
Supporters of the bill claimed it would have rewarded hard-working immigrants who had spent the majority of their lives and educational careers in the U.S.
“[Illegal immigrants] are relegated to the shadows by their status,” Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on the floor. The bill, she said, “provides an opportunity and incentive for them to prove themselves.”
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and David Rattray, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, have also voiced their support for the bill.
Opponents, however, argued that the bill too closely resembled amnesty for illegal immigrants.
“The bill at its core is a reward for illegal activities,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said in his comments on the floor.
According to an LA Times/USC poll taken after the Nov. 2 midterms, 85 percent of Democrats in California and 68 percent of Republicans supported the idea of the Dream Act. California had been working on a statewide version of the bill.
The failure of the Senate to pass the bill means that any sweeping immigration reform is unlikely to occur under the current Congress, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The bill will now be pushed into the next Congressional term — which begins January 2011 — where Republicans will wield more control.
I’m not sure why these students don’t start the process of legally immigrating to the U.S.. My parents immigrated legally, it took a while, but they followed the law. Why should anyone be allowed to jump in line?
What? The Senate blocked a bill that makes it easy for people who came here illegally to become citizens? You mean to tell me that people who shouldn’t be here to begin with shouldn’t get bailed out? Get outta town.
Seeing that the Dream Act failed to gain enough votes in the Senate, it is now way past time that the 2006 Secure Fence Act was taken seriously. The provisions of the Act that were sacrificed soon after the law was borne by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-TX), Coyrn (R-TX) and the majority of Liberal Democrats. These politicians amended the bill by cutting funding, to the–REAL–border fence that never materialized. I’m sure now the propagating Tea Party will introduce the Double border fence, with the internal barrier electrified, which would be a major deterrent to the illegal immigration invasion. This would have been an Amnesty, through–CHAIN MIGRATION–for millions of immediate family members sponsored by students? A new revised Dream Act may pass in the future, without chain migration. I think most moderate Conservatives have seen, stealth and the hidden loopholes in the agenda. ALL THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE DREAM ACT, WILL BE VIVIDLY REMEMBERED IN THE NEXT REELECTION PERIOD IN AN ADVERSE LIGHT.
Additionally Senator Reid crushed a mandatory E-Verify program that was developed to eject illegal aliens out of the workplace, which has been compromised by fraudulent ID. Both laws could be greatly enhanced by the federal government mandated the 287(g) that gives enforcement authority to the local State, county and local police to arrest and detain. It’s time the federal administrations began immigration enforcement and stop catering to foreign nationals with public entitlements and mass amnesty of any kind. Now both Democrats and Republicans better begin to contribute to American citizens-legal residents, instead of special interests and open border zealots. Gain more understanding of the illegal alien occupancy at NumbersUSA. Annually most Americans are unaware that 1.5 million legal newcomers settle in this nation, with “god Knows” how many illegal aliens to supplement the irreversible overpopulation. Most legal immigrants are heralded in by the Microsoft Bill Gates of America, in lower wage jobs. So its hard for me to understand why these billionaire business owners don’t hire US citizens and green card holders already here, to fill job opportunities or even organize national training programs?
In conclusion–even though the Dream Act failed, these scholars or any young man or women, can join the armed forces simply by going to the nearest armed forces recruiting offices in time of conflict under 8 USC § 1440. If they want their citizenship the Afghanistan war or the potential chance of fighting a war against North Korea opens the door for them. Its a misnomer that they need the Dream Act to show their courage and skills of leadership. The recruiting Sergeant is waiting for you?

In a 65-31 vote, the Senate voted to repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which did not allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. President Obama said he will sign the bill into law next week.
“It is time to close this chapter in our history,” the President said. “It is time to recognize that sacrifice, valor and integrity are no more defined by sexual orientation than they are by race or gender, religion or creed. It is time to allow gay and lesbian Americans to serve their country openly.”
More than 13,500 men and women have been dismissed from the military since the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy went into effect in 1993.
Read more about the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” from Neon Tommy.
It’ll be interesting to go to the recruitment centers and watch for what we’ve been told are legions of flamboyant gays who have been desperately wishing to be allowed to serve their country in battle. How many do you think will sign up this week? Millions or merely hundreds of thousands?
Maybe the Navy’s got room for more ssaylors.

The USC men’s basketball team had an opportunity to end the nation’s longest home winning streak, but couldn’t seal the deal. Despite Donte Smith’s second consecutive 20-point effort off the bench, USC (6-5) fell 70-68 to No. 3 Kansas (10-0) Saturday at Allen Fieldhouse.
“To be honest, we really gave that game away,” Smith said. “We played way harder than they did in the second half. We just didn’t grab a couple of rebounds.”

In the last four and a half minutes, Kansas pulled down four offensive rebounds. Their last three field goals all came after offensive rebounds. Two of the offensive boards led to 3-pointers by Jayhawks’ freshman Josh Selby, including the game-winning basket with 26 seconds remaining.
And yet, USC still had a chance. Trailing by one with 6.4 seconds remaining, Smith inbounded the ball to Jio Fontan, who scored 15 points in his Trojan debut, but the Fordham transfer stepped on the sideline, giving the ball back to Kansas.
USC then fouled Tyrel Reed on the inbound. He made the first before missing the second. Freshman Maurice Jones tracked down the rebound in the corner, but as was the case for him all day, his cross-court heave bounced off the front of the rim.
“I thought it had a chance for a minute when I let it go,” Jones said. “But it ended up going a little to the right.”
Jones finished without making a field goal for only the second time in his young career – coincidentally both last second losses for the Trojans.
While USC’s freshmen struggled – Bryce Jones was also scoreless from the field — Kansas’ highly-touted freshman lived up to the hype.
Making his much-awaited debut following a nine-game suspension for receiving improper benefits, Selby came off the bench and led all scorers with 21 points, making five of his eight 3-point attempts.
“He shot the ball unbelievably well from behind the arc,” said Kansas coach Bill Self. “He bailed us out; he saved us.”
Before Selby’s two clutch shots late in the game, Smith looked to be the hero for the second straight game. He continued his fire streak knocking down five 3-pointers in the second half.
“I’m just playing with confidence,” Smith said of his back-to-back performances – the best two games of his USC career.
USC trailed 31-20 at halftime and looked lethargic, particularly on offense. Several possessions saw the Trojans pounding the ball on the deck near half court for 15-20 seconds and then having to go one-on-one with the shot clock winding down.
Coach Kevin O’Neill went with a small lineup inserting the 5-foot-11 Smith at small forward to begin the second half. The Trojans showed more energy and slowly began working on Kansas’ lead until a 13-2 run beginning with just under 11 minutes remaining gave USC its first lead of the game.

The two teams traded the lead seven times in the final eight minutes of the game. But it was the veteran Jayhawks and their stud rookie that did the little things to continue their winning streak at Allen Fieldhouse, where they have now won 65 straight.
“We wanted to end the streak,” Smith said. “We just didn’t grab a rebound at the end, but we got another big game to get ready for.”
Alex Stepheson had a season-high 18 points on a season-high 15 field goal attempts. Nikola Vucevic scored only 13 points (6-of-8 shooting) as he was constantly harassed by double teams. Both big men grabbed eight rebounds, but neither could collect the big defensive rebounds when the Trojans needed them the most down the stretch.
The Trojans continue traveling east, heading to Knoxville to take on Tennessee on Tuesday at 7 p.m. EST.
