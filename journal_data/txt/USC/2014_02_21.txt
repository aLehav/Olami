Under the purple florescent lights at LA Live stood a crowd of enthusiastic fans with brightly colored wigs and even brighter clothes. Parents, children, teenagers and adults from all around the world came together to celebrate the return of international Japanese pop star Kyary Pamyu Pamyu and the debut of her new album. Some devoted fans rhythmically hummed some of Kyary’s chart topping songs while others snapped group photos of young and older Kyary imitators. Despite the fairly large crowd, the absence of international news syndications at the event signaled less interest in Kyary’s second world tour. Was her second performance not as exciting as her first?
Japanese pop star Kyary performed at LA Live last week.
Clearly the ever growing crowd of fans would beg to differ. Many of them traveled far to come see her in Los Angeles; others have followed her throughout the tour’s North American leg. Whether they came out of admiration for her fashion sense or because they were just spellbound by her talent, these fans came to LA Live on a busy holiday weekend to enjoy her music. One devoted fan strut her finely detailed replica of Kyary’s queen outfit from “Tsukema Tsukeru (Putting on Falsies)” while staying in character throughout the entire concert; she even fanned herself in a haughty manner from her second floor seat while the rest of the crowd was busy chanting for an encore.
Another fan, this time a young teenager, draped herself in an oversized pink bow and skirt with stitched snack bags as homage to the same aforementioned music video.
What makes Kyary so appealing to such a large audience?
“There’s just something about her that makes her so universal,” said William Schreiner, a 45 year old fan. He described his passionate idolization of Kyary began since he watched her viral hit “PONPONPON.” This concert marks his seventh time seeing Kyary in concert. According to William, “Kyary’s fanbase is largely female in Japan.”
But this Sunday night crowd saw an even number of male and females in the crowd dressed to cheer in their Harajuku pastel colored outfits, ready for their princess to descend onto the stage in front of them. For the fans that had time to spare and wanted to prove they were there, Kyary’s mascot Pamyurin was open for business.
While the crowd still trickled to fill in the second floor, Kyary tweeted a backstage picture of a scared yet shocked face with the caption: “It’s almost time for LA Live!” Following her tweet, the crowd grew more and more excited as the haunting music box song in the background grew louder. Suddenly the lights dimmed, creating oscillating waves of shrill cheers from the bottom to the top floor.
The curtains withdrew, revealing a starkly colored wonderland of inflated mascots and typical bedroom furniture.
“I brought my stage all the way from Japan!” Kyary announced to show the audience they were truly in for a special treat. Indeed, this concert was more grandiose than her first concert. Although the stage decorations were not as numerous as the year before, the dancers (known as the Kyary Kids) were able to integrate the decorations into their performance. During “Mottai Night Land (Wasteful Night Land),” the female backup dancers would sleep on the highlighter yellow bed or pretend and play with the letter blocks.
Compared to last year, the transitions between the intermissions were better timed than the year before. Two unnamed mascots danced onstage alongside various videos of Kyary engaging in a series of ridiculous events. However, the videos themselves were repeats of the ones from last year and did not include subtitles for non-Japanese speaking viewers. As such, some of the jokes such from the poker game video fell flat with the crowd, creating only mild, scattered laughter.
After her first world tour, Kyary learned to greet the crowd with more confidence but at the same time, she still shied away from speaking even rehearsed lines and opted to read from a large white piece of paper that shielded her face. Furthermore, Kyary’s fashion sense never fails to surprise the crowd as this year’s dresses were all full of stark, contrasting colors, which differentiated from the Japanese Lolita inspired dresses she wore the year before.
Despite the debut of her newest song, “Yume no Hajima Ring Ring (The Dream’s Beginnring-Ring)” it did not draw the same reaction from the Los Angeles crowd that the dubstep beats of “Invader Invader” did a year earlier. The muted reaction of the crowd during Kyary’s performance of her new song did not phase the pop star as she continued to energetically sing and cued the crowd to sing the repetitive words back to her.
Throughout the concert, Kyary and the Kyary Kids remained unfazed by the collected crowd; never missing a beat, never broke a sweat even during jumps and long durations of nonstop singing. After the stunning finale, the crowd flowed out like a mint colored wave and “PONPONPON” their “wei” into the night.
How long was the concert? I’m going to the NYC concert; and it starts at 8 PM, but my bus leaves at 11PM.
The ticket said 8 p.m., it started around 8:15, and the single encore (like last year) was over at 9:45.  No opening acts.  Go!

Multi-talented Japanese musician Yoshiki Hayashi sparked renewed interest in classical music during his second visit to the GRAMMY Museum Wednesday night. The momentous occasion was hosted by Stan Lee and Marc Geiger, both collaborative partners and longtime friends of Yoshiki. As the GRAMMY Museum unveiled their newest addition to their expanding exhibit, die-hard fans nearly smothered themselves on the glass to catch a mere glimpse of Yoshiki’s piano before his live performance.
Japanese musician Yoshiki announced a world tour on Wednesday.
Press anxiously swarmed around the transparent crystal piano, waiting for the man of the night to descend from his grunge tower above. As writers fiddled with their pens and camera operators stationed their devices, Stan Lee made a brief introductory speech about Yoshiki.
“There’s never been a musician quite like him,” Lee said. “Classical, pop, name your instrument, he plays it and he plays it better than most anybody else.”
Known for his versatile talent in music, Yoshiki , along with his band X Japan, transformed the rock scene in Japan. The group founded the now widely popular visual kei, or visual style, nearly 30 years ago. Classically trained as a child, his talents cross and unite the opposing genres of classical and heavy metal music. His greatest feat is not his impressive platinum discs on display, but rather reminding the world and the music industry that classical music and rock are not mutually exclusive genres.
After quickly congratulating Yoshiki on the exhibit and advertising their collaborative comic Blood Red Dragon, Lee stepped away to return the spotlight back onto his partner. Despite the overwhelming amount of questions thrown his way, Yoshiki calmly addressed the crowd in both English and Japanese, maintaining perfect posture and composure.
“I don’t know what to say,” Yoshiki said. “I’m honored to be featured here.”
Surprisingly, Yoshiki’s exhibit is only a small corner of the museum, filled with numerous memorabilia from his successful career as both a solo artist and as the lead member of X Japan. The glass panels contain two of the 13 items on display: a large X Japan plaque consisting of the band’s gold and platinum records, along with a YoshiKitty — yes, he has his own commemorative Hello Kitty. Despite the amount of items being limited, fans can look forward to the ones that are on display, including one of Yoshiki’s many visual kei outfits. In addition, the replica of his Kawai Crystal II Grand Piano CR-40A in the museum’s lobby will leave fans drooling as it allows them to see the very backbone of Yoshiki’s music.
Before the musician’s rooftop performance, Marc Geiger, a famous talent agent and the musician’s promoter, explained his interest in Yoshiki.
“Right when I heard Yoshiki playing at the Grammy Museum last August, I was so impressed that I told him ‘you got to go out on the road,’” he said. “And he initially fought and he said ‘no’ and then ‘yes,’ but now he is going to tour the world.”
Fans, both international and domestic, have been hungry for the rockstar’s return to music since his composition of the 69th Golden Globe Awards theme in 2012. After two years, Yoshiki is ready to return to the stage but this time under his classical talents. He gave the Wednesday night audience a small taste of some of the songs they can expect on his world tour.
Starring an all-female quartet (including  a USC Thornton School of Music alumna), the stage was primed for the ultimate up close and personal experience. Yoshiki impressively conducted the quartet by merely flipping his hair while skillfully sliding his fingers down the crystal piano’s keys. Fans and press members packed tightly together as each fought to capture the perfect angle of Yoshiki as he softly dipped his head low enough to graze his own fingers.
During his first song, Yoshiki’s sorrowful rendition of X Japan’s rock ballad “Forever Love” left the air damp with tears. Halfway into his performance, the self-proclaimed “vampire” hid his eyes with his iconic sunglasses as the projector lights had become “too bright for him.” Some fans in the crowd speculated it might have been done to boost his confidence as the audience had shaken him with their proximity. By the final song, a solemn rendition of X Japan’s “Endless Rain,” they were pushing towards the stage to become close enough to reach him.
Both Yoshiki’s classical album and his heavy metal discography can be found on iTunes. His tour’s will stop in Costa Mesa, Calif., on April 25. Tickets for the concert will go on sale soon.

Valentine’s Day and the long weekend for President’s Day made last weekend perfect for bingeing. No, I don’t mean the type of bingeing where you drown your loneliness and sorrow in a box of chocolate; I mean binge-watching “House of Cards.”
The highly-anticipated second season of the political drama premiered in its entirety on Netflix at midnight on Feb. 14. In the first 24 hours, 16 percent of Netflix subscribers had watched at least one episode of the show, according to Forbes, more than eight times the number of viewers that watched the series opener a year ago.
And, according to a report by Procera Networks, about 670,000 people – two percent of Netflix’s 33.4 million U.S. subscribers –  binge-watched all 13 episodes during its first weekend, about four times the number of viewers who binge-watched the first season.
Binge watching has become a common practice, particularly on college campuses, but is it worth it?
In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that a Netflix study of viewer patterns found that, among 10 “currently popular shows” including “House of Cards,” 25 percent of viewers finished an entire 13 episode serialized drama in two days and 48 percent of viewers finished within a week.
It’s certainly a great feeling when you find a show and can’t stop watching, but it’s a rough feeling when you finish.
It’s not that binge-watching is unhealthy —  I really could care less if you don’t leave your room for three days and the pizza guy is your only form of human contact. But one of the things that makes television so great and distinguishes it from movies is that viewers can form a long-term relationship with characters. Viewers grow with the characters. The high school students who started watching “Grey’s Anatomy” when it began in 2005 could have graduated from college and gone on to medical school, or gotten married and started their own families, much like the characters on the show.
But when you binge watch a show everything happens at warp speed. The three years between Meredith and Derek’s wedding and the birth of their child becomes one week in binge time. Lexie Grey appears on the show for four seasons, but in binge time, that’s just a few weeks.
But it’s not only your relationships with the characters that are different when you binge watch; it’s also your appreciation for the details. A friend recently turned me on to “Veronica Mars.” I watched all three seasons of the show in less than a month over winter break and I’ve already bought my tickets to see the movie next month.
There’s no doubt I’m a fan of the show, but when I finished, I wasn’t quite sure why fans were called “marshmallows.” 
I asked my friend, and she directed me toward two lines. The first comes from the pilot. Veronica’s friend Wallace says that, regardless of her tough exterior, on the inside, “you’re a marshmallow, Veronica Mars.” In season two Logan, echoes Wallace, describing Veronica as a girl who “smelled of marshmallows and promises.”
 
That’s all it was. Two lines that resonated with millions of fans but in my binge watching frenzy I just grazed over them.
 
The biggest problem is figuring out what you do when you’re done binge watching a show. If you’re bingeing just to catch up on a show before the next episode airs, you’re golden. But, among college students in particular, the chance of watching live TV is slim, so you’re probably binge watching an entire series. Before you know it you’re done and you’re stuck watching YouTube videos to relive your favorite moments.
But I’m not going to stop binge watching, and you shouldn’t either. But choose carefully the shows you binge watch, because your love for those shows will be more fleeting than the shows you commit to weekly.

With President’s Day Weekend behind us and the Academy Awards creeping up in about a week, new releases are sparse this weekend, with a pair of action films lacking in both good marketing and critical acclaim.
This week’s new releases, Pompeii and 3 Days to Kill, are both targeted toward the male demographic, a shift from last weekend’s romantic trifecta. Neither film has a lot of promise, but the relative lack of quality films in theaters right now could mean that they garner decent amounts of viewers.
Pompeii, directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, known for the Resident Evil franchise and Alien vs. Predator, tells the tale of a slave-turned-gladiator who must save his true love during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Kit Harington, better known for playing Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, stars as protagonist Milo, and is supported by a cast including Emily Browning as love interest Cassia and Kiefer Sutherland as Cassia’s villainous fiancé. Although the films sounds like a rehashing of the plot of Titanic, replacing a sinking ship with an erupting volcano, this film should not receive same acclaim or viewership. The film should do reasonably well this weekend, but won’t sit atop the box office.
3 Days to Kill, starring Kevin Costner as an aging government agent who must fulfill one last assignment while reconciling with his estranged daughter, also seems oddly reminiscent of an earlier film, Taken. When Taken came out in 2008, it helped jumpstart Liam Neeson’s career as an older action hero. Despite being involved with some major projects recently (Man of Steel, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit), don’t expect Costner to recreate Neeson’s traction. 3 Days to Kill seems like a standard run-of-the-mill action flick, so don’t expect it to rank very high in the box office.
The Lego Movie should continue to its third week atop the box office grosses. The film is the only one in theaters that targets the family demographic, plus it comes off a strong President’s Day weekend where it exceeded expectations. The film has already grossed $200 million worldwide and shows no signs of slowing down. About Last Night should remain at a distant number two, relying on the popularity of Kevin Hart and the general lack of quality films released this early in the year.

I was never one of those girls who dreamed of her wedding as a kid or dreamed of being a princess. My versions of these typical dreams were, “Someday, I am going to be a college athlete,” or “Someday, I am going to own three Great Danes and I am going to name them obscure names, like Gertrude, Pineapple and Wonky.” Recently, that dream became, “Someday, I will own my own restaurant-grade tortilla press.” Yes, I get very excited over kitchenware.
Kitchenware is an investment and also a gateway to explore and create new dishes, and it is absolutely worth it. Whenever I go to a mall, I find myself going into the same stores – Williams-Sonoma, Sur La Table and the bookstore’s cooking section – and very few people can get me out.
My sister can usually bring me back from whatever planet I go to because my interests clearly are not the same as most girls my age. She always tries to motivate me to go into H&M or Urban Outfitters to find something “cute,” but whenever I think cute, I think of the mini stainless steel muffin tins, the mini tea set that they make for kids or the novelty cooking necklaces that they sell for food geeks like myself.
My favorite place to online shop is Food52. The online cook Q&A website meets blog that seems to read my mind and make me feel like I joined some sort of food cult. As if taking a page of out Amazon’s book, Food52 emails you recommendations of what they think you would like to buy to complement a recent purchase. Since joining the site, I am never at a loss for what to cook or splurge on next.
Williams-Sonoma and Sur La Table are also some of the best brick-and-mortar places. At one point, I thought of working at a store in my hometown, until I realized that my paycheck would probably go towards filling my kitchen with new gadgets.
This bug inside me is like something out of the movie, “Confessions of a Shopaholic,” but my addiction isn’t bad. If anything, it benefits others because I cook and bake up a storm.

A new master’s program has been developed by the USC Rossier School of Education, the Master of Education in Learning Design and Technology. The new program will come into effect this fall. It is an online program that mixes live classes with individual work.
The program requires its participants to complete 30 units and 20 months of coursework. It is meant for people who want to begin careers in online learning, instructional evaluation and design and corporate training. The courses will be planned for times that work with the schedules of those with full-time jobs.
The curriculum was created by an advisory panel comprised of USC faculty from a variety of disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, education and instructional design.
