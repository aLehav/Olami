The Jesse M. Unruh Institute in partnership with the Political Student Assembly and the Black Student Assembly discussed President Barack Obama’s legacy and how his race and demeanor set important precedents for the current presidential election Monday night in The Forum.
The panel consisted of retired California Senator and legal expert Kevin Murray, Associate Provost for Faculty and Student Initiatives in the Social Sciences Camille Gear Rich, BSA Executive Board member Ayele Townsend and BSA member Khalil Fair. The panel was moderated by Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur and BSA member Tiaira Muhammad.
Schnur talked about how Obama’s political history led many to misunderstand his stance on issues as well as future policy decisions.
“President Obama’s strong opposition of the Iraq War from the very beginning may have led a lot of people to presume that he was a much more progressive candidate than he turned out to be,” Schnur said.
The conversation then turned to the current presidential election cycle and the differences in the 2016 election compared to Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012.
Townsend said that both Obama’s election and the current election between Democratic presidential nominees Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton highlight the importance of the African-American vote and its power in elections.
“Hillary Clinton is getting a run for her money again, this time from Senator [Bernie] Sanders,” Townsend said. “It demonstrates how crucial the black vote is, however I don’t think it should be automatically assumed that black people vote Democrat or that the Democratic Party automatically gets the black vote.”
Rich agreed regarding the power of the black vote, particularly as the black vote has become one of the most committed demographics during Clinton’s campaign, but was worried about black voter turnout in this next election.
“I’m thrilled about the discussion about the African-American vote and the explicit courting of the African-American vote,” Rich said. “There is also, however, an issue of African-American voter turnout, which was about 11-13 percent for Obama, amounting to about 4 million votes which can turn an election.”
And while another milestone could be reached if Clinton wins the presidency, Rich questioned the significance of the role as the first female president to the election.
“Just [as] Obama said, ‘Being black isn’t going to color the way I’m president in a particular way,’ if electing a woman as president doesn’t give us anything in terms of difference, well then, what is the historic value in electing her?” Rich said.
A major point of discussion for the panelists was how Obama’s “coolness factor” tied into his presidency. According to Schnur, Obama’s public persona was uniquely defined by his frequent appearances on late night television, interviews with celebrities and personable manner. Fair then remembered some of the moments that he thought defined Obama’s “coolness.”
“For me, the coolest things Obama did during his presidency were going on [The Ellen DeGeneres Show] and dancing, giving the eulogy for South Carolina victims and singing ‘Amazing Grace,’ and the interview where he killed a fly,” Fair said.
Rich, however, warned of praising a president based on “being cool,” as it can lead voters to oversee poor policy decisions in favor of oversimplifying a president.
“The politics of coolness is a very dangerous thing,” Rich said. “It got us Clinton who played the sax but also got us welfare reform. And when we look for coolness, we look for two things — we are looking for a way to connect with younger people and often marginalized communities which typically do ‘cooler’ stuff.”
If all we see is “cool” in President Obama, we negate the continual opposition to his leadership from day one and the obscene attitude toward him of other legislators unparalleled in modern history. To add insult to injury the opposition rarely had any ideas at all or never attempted to improve on the ACA, but they exhausted lawsuits and appeals trying to repeal it; under the circumstances it is my opinion that the President did an excellent job…

Following the release of a comprehensive study on Hollywood’s lack of diversity, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted a panel with some of the industry’s key decision-makers Monday night for a discussion on how to increase representation of women and minority groups both on and behind the screen.
The event, titled “Inclusion or Invisibility?” was put on by Annenberg’s Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative and moderated by Stacy Smith, the initiative’s creator and a professor of communication at Annenberg. The panel consisted of Stephanie Allain, film producer and director of L.A. Film Festival; Pete Nowalk, creator of the ABC series How to Get Away with Murder; and Cathy Schulman, head of production for STX Entertainment.
Smith, along with her team of more than 100 undergraduates, found that females are underrepresented on screen across the entertainment ecosystem. According to the study, there is a lack of both female executives and women involved in the production process behind the camera.
“We don’t have a diversity problem, we have an inclusion crisis,” Smith said.
Ernest J. Wilson, dean of Annenberg, provided the opening remarks, saying that diversity and inclusion need to improve in the industry in order for real change to occur.
“Diversity is nice, inclusion is important — but frankly, it ain’t enough,” Wilson said. “This is only the beginning, a starting point. The idea of change and power has to begin with knowledge.”
But Schulman also noted that progress is being made to address this problem.
“The good news is, it’s changing,” Schulman said. “We are at the tipping point as it regards inclusion. There is a demand to know, and a nervousness about how this is still happening. We’re just at the beginning of putting some plans in motion.”
In addition to working as head of production for STX Entertainment, Schulman is also president of the Women in Film Institute, which serves as a major contributor to Smith’s research. She is also the producer of the Academy Award-winning film Crash.
The MDSC Initiative produces research ranging from topics such as stereotypes pertaining to race and gender on-screen, employment patterns in the entertainment industry and barriers facing women in Hollywood.
The event follows the release of the initiative’s latest study, which provides a statistical analysis of a “whitewashed” Hollywood, following controversy prompted by the release of the 2016 Academy Award nominations, in which for the second year in a row, all 20 of the acting nominees were white.
Smith, along with her research team and co-authors of the study Dr. Katherine Pieper and Marc Choueiti, examined the inclusivity of Hollywood in three central areas: on-screen portrayals of gender, race/ethnicity and the LGBT community, hiring practices behind the camera and the number of female executives in the industry.
“It’s so important who is at the table,” Allain said. “Any business that creates images that travel the world has to have a diverse group of people at the table.”
Smith concluded that some groups are still underrepresented on screen. Behind the camera, females face exclusionary hiring practices. However, Nowalk agreed with Smith’s final conclusion that television and digital are more inclusive than film.
“TV is so different from movies because you can really discover the character,” Norwalk said. “Casting Viola Davis [in How to Get Away with Murder] really changed the journey of the character. TV is different because it’s a much more collaborative and long term process.”
At the end of the panel, Allain stressed that consumers are responsible for increasing diversity in the entertainment industry .
“When we talk about wanting diverse voices and seeing movies directed by women and people of color, it is incumbent upon us,” Allain said. “You can’t ask for that, then not support it when it’s in front of you.”

The 2016 USC Arts Career Week, a series of career panels and workshops dedicated to helping students find careers that suit their passions for the arts, kicked off on Monday with a discussion featuring Rick Baptist of American Federation of Musicians Local 47 at The Music Complex in the Thornton School of Music.
The Arts Career Week, which takes place between Feb. 22-25, provides an opportunity for students interested in the arts to discover occupations related to various creative endeavors, ranging from instrumental performance to managerial positions. It is hosted by the Performing Arts Committee, a branch of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board that brings different performers to USC, as well as sponsors related to the music industry.
This year marks the inaugural year for the Arts Career Week, which is open to all USC students regardless of major, and was created primarily to provide additional resources to USC students who are considering a career in the arts.
“We’ve been hearing that a lot of the art students didn’t feel that there were enough career events tailored to their needs,” said Sara Kern, co-assistant director for the Performing Arts Committee. “And for people who are interested in the arts but aren’t in any of the arts programs … this event gives them the opportunity to network and explore a wider array of careers.”
The discussion panel on Monday with Baptist, vice president of the Hollywood chapter of AMF and acclaimed trumpet player, and Eric Dubbury, a USG senator and intern for Baptist. Both Baptist and Dubbury focused on the multitude of options and opportunities available to performing musicians through the AMF, encouraging students to pursue their passions for music.
Also on Monday was the Live Music Production panel. Hosted in collaboration with the Music Industry Connection and Concerts Committee, the event brought in professionals from the field who talked about their experiences in production and networked with students.
Students who attended the event were excited to hear from Baptist and gain insights into the professional music industry. Ellen Shinogle, a first year master’s student in trumpet performance, looks forward to attending a Screen Actors Guild panel on Thursday as well.
“Rick Baptist is a legend, and being a trumpet player [myself], I wanted to hear all his stories about the films he’s played on. It’s really inspirational,” Shinogle said. “He offered me a lesson and time to talk later, so I’m really thankful he was so personable and generous with his time.”
The 2016 USC Arts Career Week will end on Thursday.

Over 100 veterans will soon have the opportunity to receive a free USC education thanks to a new program created by the  School of Social Work
Salute4Vets, which launched on Feb. 11, will provide free education to 120 veterans who qualify for the post-9/11 GI Bill Yellow Ribbon scholarship. These scholarships are provided to allow veterans to come to USC to receive a free master’s degree in social work with a military specialization.
The program is funded between the scholarship initiative itself and the funds offered by the Yellow Ribbon scholarship from the veterans administration. The remaining funds for this program will be raised by donations. The program’s motto reads, “Helping one veteran helps 100 more.”
The initiators have created a website, salute4vets.org, that features a donations component. The website also uses social media as a major facet of their marketing.
Individuals can take a selfie of themselves saluting and then post it on social networks using the hashtag “#salute4vets.”
“We’ve taken a very innovative approach to fundraising, and we are doing it through crowdfunding,” said John Dumbacher, head of corporate partnerships for the School of Social Work. “The crowdfunding campaign goes until Aug. 1, and right now we have already funded one veteran scholarship. We hope to raise 2.6 million dollars, so that by August we will have funded 120 scholarships.”
Dumbacher got the idea of launching Salute4Vets while talking to students and graduates of the school of social work who were veterans, where Dumbacher came across stories of those students helping other veterans.
“Those students are helping on average about 100 veterans each year. We have 1,176 graduates of the program today, and that means over a 100,000 veterans were helped last year. So we started gathering the best of those stories and then [felt] we need to tell this [story] because it’s amazing and unique,” Dumbacher said.
This program is aimed at helping veterans make the transition back into their civilian life and providing psychological and social support.
“Veterans need a new challenge, and they need a way to focus and help other people. Many of them have found great success in understanding ways to work best with other veterans,” Dumbacher said. “Many of these stories really revolve around the fact that by helping other veterans they really help themselves as well.”
Veterans and former graduates of the School of Social Work Gena Truitt, Kristen Kavanaugh and Nathan Graeser have been working with veterans, along with current student Michael Branch.
Dumbacher and his team put this campaign together with the help and support of students, faculty members such as Dean of School of Social Work Marilyn Flynn, and top social media and public service announcement agencies like Sprinklr and Connect360.
Dumbacher plans on advertising on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to spread the word over social media. The program is also creating a public service announcement directed to 800 TV stations and over 1,500 radio stations to raise awareness for the organization’s work.
“What we hope to accomplish in this campaign is to show veterans that we really do value their service,” Dumbacher said.

A mobile app called Su Sofá aims to change the way people travel. The app, which connects travelers with hosts via networks of Facebook friends, was created by Vivi Wu, a USC alumna, and Shem Weissman, a graduate of California State University, Long Beach.
Described as a “safe way to travel with friends,” the app allows users to offer to host prospective travelers or to seek out a place to stay, all within one’s Facebook network. In the language of a press release, “nobody is a stranger on Su Sofá.”
“I don’t like to travel by myself, but I travel a lot, and it can be awkward to try to call up each of my friends and ask if I can stay with them,” Wu said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “So Shem and I think if we can build a network where everyone is interested, [it] will provide a great service for people who travel frequently.”
In addition to Wu’s search for places to stay with friends, Weissman has been no stranger to offering friends a couch to sleep on. Weissman’s background in online marketing and e-commerce combines with Wu’s financial and management knowledge to create an effective team aiming to change the way people travel.
“Ultimately, our goal is to be able to offer people an alternative way to travel,” Weissman said. “If you [use] Airbnb or [Couchsurfing.com] or something like that and you’re staying with strangers, it’s OK and I’m sure the people are decent. But if you can go and hang out with your real friends, that’s going to be a great experience.”
Wu expressed concerns regarding the safety of staying with strangers.
“I would rather be by myself in a hotel than staying with a stranger at their house,” Wu said.
The app aims to fill a need not met by other services or by hotels. To Weissman and Wu, individually asking friends on Facebook for a place to stay “seems a little impractical.”
“We think this is a way to really concentrate that whole process. Everyone with the app already has an interest in this, and it brings all these people to one place,” Weissman said.
Though Weissman says the project, which launched on Jan. 16, is at its “very beginning” now, it is undergoing continual development. He says the application has seen “good engagement” so far.
In the long term, Su Sofá aims to offer complementary travel services through its mobile application alongside the main host-matching system. As an example, Weissman proposed offering discounted airline tickets for locations that users had expressed an interest in visiting.
For now, though, the duo hopes to gain traction for their service on college campuses, starting with USC.
“My time at USC was a party!” Wu said. “Not a party filled with alcohol and skipping class, but a party filled with great friends and incredible experiences that will stay with me a lifetime. With Su Sofá, we feel we can provide that same USC party experience to everyone.”
Weissman said that while they’re starting at USC, they hope that the app will continue to grow from there.
“You have friends from all over the country [with whom] you went to high school,” Weissman said, “and now you’re all spread out, so this might be an opportunity. You have spring break coming up. You can find your friends through [the app] and stay together again.”

After opening the season over the weekend with a series against North Dakota, USC baseball now prepares for two midweek games: a short trip to Loyola Marymount and an exhibition game at Dedeaux Field against Korean Baseball Organization outfit NC Dinos.
The Trojans suffered an upset in their opening series of the season, dropping two out of three against the Fighting Hawks. Head coach Dan Hubbs said he hoped his players would learn from their experience against North Dakota.
“They’ve learned they have to compete non-stop, and they have to have tough at-bats,” Hubbs said. “We have to execute when we’re on the mound and not just think that because we throw hard, we’re going to throw the ball by everybody.”
With that being said, Hubbs admitted everyone, including players and coaches, was still in the process of getting into the rhythm of the season.
“Everybody’s trying to figure out what they have right now,” Hubbs said. “Who will be your starters once you get into league [play]?”
Junior catcher Jeremy Martinez agreed with his coach but said he wasn’t worried about the team’s surprisingly challenging opening series.
“It’s going to be a process throughout the season, and as long as we’re going forward and putting 100 percent in each day, I think we’ll be fine,” Martinez said.
Martinez and company look forward to taking on LMU next. LMU is returning from a long road trip to Fort Worth, where the Lions dropped two of three to TCU. LMU finished 2015 season with a 33-21-1 overall record, and the team advanced all the way to the West Coast Conference Championship before falling to Pepperdine.
The last meeting between USC and LMU came in 2014, when the Trojans beat the Lions 4-2 at Page Stadium. USC has not suffered a loss against LMU since 2012.
Next, USC will welcome the NC Dinos to Dedeaux Field. The Dinos are a professional Korean baseball team based in Changwon, South Korea. They were founded as a franchise in 2011, and their roster features a few former major leaguers, such as first baseman and Pepperdine product Eric Thames, who last year became the first player in KBO history to hit for the cycle twice in one season. The Dinos finished second in the KBO in 2015, before being knocked out of the playoffs by the eventual champion Doosan Bears.
Senior outfielder Timmy Robinson, whose walk-off hit salvaged a win for the Trojans on Sunday, said the team would work toward getting sharper over the course of the next two games.
“[We want to] clean up things that happened this weekend and move on … and get things rolling for the season,” Robinson said. “We know we have the talent. We just have to play our game.”
Robinson has been nursing an arm injury since before the start of the season, which affected his swing and relegated him to designated hitter duty in the series against North Dakota. Robinson will likely not see the field against LMU or NC, but he looks to return to patrolling center field by this weekend’s series against Wake Forest.
USC’s tilt against LMU begins at 6 p.m. on Tuesday at Page Stadium. The Trojans then return home to Dedeaux Field the next day. First pitch for the exhibition versus the NC Dinos is scheduled for 6:30 p.m.

The previously surging men’s basketball team took a step back with its 80-69 loss at the hands of Utah on Sunday, with the Utes snapping the Men of Troy’s historic 15-game win streak at home.
Despite being ranked nationally in January and February, the Trojans are not in the AP Top 25 Poll for the second consecutive week after losing three of their past four games to Arizona State, Arizona and Utah to rank fifth in the Pac-12 with an 8-6 record.
The Men of Troy were given  two votes in the top 25 this week and are still projected by many to make the NCAA tournament.
USC joins Arizona (No. 9), Oregon (No. 13), Utah (No. 22) and Cal (34 votes) as the five Pac-12 teams to earn votes in the AP Top 25 Poll. According to CBS Sports’ Jerry Palm’s projected bracket, the Pac-12 is tied with the ACC, the Big 12 and the Big 10 with seven potential tournament bids.
While earning a seed in the tournament should be an easy task considering USC has two home games left, the strength of their seeding could be compromised by their next two contests against Stanford and Cal on the road.
This season, the Trojans hold a 3-5 record on the road, losing by an average margin of 13.6 points, which truly illustrates the effect that a Pac-12 home court advantage can play. The combined home record of the top six teams in the Pac-12 stands at 93-4 with just two teams holding undefeated records.
USC’s next two opponents, the  Cardinal and Golden Bears, have a combined 26-5 home record with the 16-0 Bears defeating the likes of Arizona, Utah, Colorado and Oregon by an average margin of victory of 12, including a 20-point stomping of Oregon more than a week ago.
While Stanford holds an unimpressive 13-12 overall and 6-8 conference record, the Cardinal have downed Oregon, Utah and Cal at home.
If USC can finally break out of its road slump, a run at the Pac-12 Championship could be within reach for a program which hasn’t reached the NCAA tournament since 2008.
Not to mention, with home wins against Oregon and Oregon State on March 2 and 5, the Trojans could see themselves once again in the AP Top 25 poll and in good position for a deep tournament run.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that USC lost to Utah 80-68. It was 80-69. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

As Utah applied the finishing touches to an 80-69 victory over USC at the Galen Center on Sunday afternoon, a unique feeling likely kicked in for many Trojan fans.
It was not the worst feeling in the world, but it was a distinct one. It was the unmistakable feeling of falling to a team that refused to lose its cool.
Utah has incredible composure. The faithful at Galen may have gasped every time sophomore forward Jakob Poeltl effortlessly collected the ball and laid it in for two, but Utah’s win over the Trojans was much bigger than just a 7-foot Austrian playing center.
The Utes’ ability to repeatedly quiet the Trojans obviously involved a number of factors, including strong defensive organization from the visitors as well as an uncharacteristically lackluster performance from the Trojans. However, Utah’s discipline with the ball was truly something.
Underrated players are everywhere. With star players garnering loads of attention, many talented youngsters slip through the cracks in terms of receiving national media attention. If you watch even five minutes of a national television broadcast on college hoops, you will almost certainly hear the name Buddy Hield. Likewise, even if watching these 20-year-old student-athletes is your form of religion, you have probably had never heard of Brandon Taylor or Lorenzo Bonam before Sunday.
This guard duo dashed any hopes of a USC victory, particularly down the final stretch of the game. Taylor and Bonam did their part defensively, but with the ball in their hands, they showed excellent vision and poise.
Taylor served up 10 assists in the win, consistently finding the open man with his head on a swivel. Taylor, a senior with the Utes who hails from Los Angeles, has continued to develop his game even though Delon Wright, Taylor’s former backcourt mate, is now playing for the Toronto Raptors in the NBA. When Taylor and Wright played together — which they did for two seasons — the rangy Wright ran the point. However, Taylor inherited that role this season, and he has really evolved as the campaign has progressed. His game is well-rounded, and he takes care of the basketball.
Utah was a Sweet 16 team last year, and if Larry Krystkowiak’s team had not run into Duke at that point, their tourney run could very well have been longer.
Against USC, that invaluable experience showed. Utah looked like a team that had been there before. They looked smooth. They looked unfazed. They also looked like an unselfish bunch.
One of the most adept passers on the floor was Bonam. A transfer from Gillette College in Wyoming, Bonam has excelled in his first season in Salt Lake City. Bonam finished the contest with just 9 points, but he impacted the game in some way during each of his 33 minutes on the floor.
Utah is a fundamentally sound team. The Utes are a well-oiled machine and could be a tough matchup come March should they continue to play like this. While they may not be the trendiest pick in either the Pac-12 Tournament or the NCAA Tournament, the Utes are quietly chugging right along on a four-game winning streak at the moment.
Elite guard play helped the Utes take care of USC on Sunday, and it could also catapult this team back into the Sweet 16. After all, that is the very reason Kentucky is still a legitimate candidate to return to the Final Four this season.

USC head football coach Clay Helton announced last Friday that Austin Thomas, the 2015 FootballScoop Player Personnel Director of the Year, will return to USC as the director of player personnel and NFL research.
Previously, Thomas served as a defensive intern and a recruiting assistant before moving to Louisiana State University to serve as their director of player personnel.
In his role, Thomas is responsible for evaluating prospective players, managing recruiting events and maintaining a recruiting network.
At LSU, Thomas was successful in helping the program to claim three straight top-five signing classes and in signing No. 1 recruit Leonard Fournette in 2014.
His 2016 recruiting class is currently ranked sixth by Rivals.com.
Thomas began his career as a recruiting intern and defensive assistant at Tennessee.
He then followed former head coach Lane Kiffin to USC, where he worked as a defensive intern, recruiting assistant and assistant director of operations before moving to LSU in 2013.
His role on the LSU operations team for the past three years was praised by those in his department as one of the most important contributions in strengthening and solidifying a powerhouse LSU team.
“Austin is a future NFL general manager, there’s not a doubt in my mind,” former LSU recruiting coordinator and assistant head coach Frank Wilson said in an interview with FootballScoop after Thomas received the 2015 award. “I’ve never worked with someone as talented as he is in this role.”

With USC Athletic Director Pat Haden stepping down at the end of June, University President C. L. Max Nikias and the administration have a few months to find a replacement to head the school’s storied athletic program.
Whether the Trojans choose to hire from within or go “outside the Trojan family” remains to be seen. In his letter announcing Haden’s retirement, Nikias stated the search “will be national in scope.”
“It’s going to be a serious search,” Nikias said to the Los Angeles Times last week, adding that he would consider “everybody.”
It is worth noting that both Haden and his predecessor, Mike Garrett, were legendary figures at USC, as they were both players before taking the athletic director post.
If USC chooses to stay the course with an in-house hire, one of the favorites should be Steve Lopes, who has been at the University since 1984 and currently serves as senior associate athletic director, chief operating officer and chief financial officer for USC Athletics. Lopes would be the “next man up” within USC and a natural choice should Nikias opt to play it safe.
Another in-house candidate is J.K. McKay, also a senior associate athletic director who played with Haden at USC in the 1970s and serves as his right hand man in the athletic department. His father is former head football coach John McKay, after which the McKay Center is named, all of which gives the younger McKay a strong case to take the reins.
But since Nikias noted the search would be “national,” USC will presumably look at outside candidates, and perhaps make the rare move of hiring a fresh face as athletic director.
Villanova athletic director Mark Jackson will see his name connected to the job, considering he just left USC —  where he was a senior associate athletic director — in August of last year, a post he had held since 2009. It was Jackson’s second go-round with the Trojans; he worked as the director of football administration during the Pete Carroll era. But Jackson may be hesitant to leave his Villanova post so quickly for a third stint at USC.
Aside from Jackson, USC may try to lure successful athletic directors away from smaller schools. Arizona’s Greg Byrne, Stanford’s Bernard Muir, TCU’s Chris Del Conte and Northwestern’s Jim Phillips have been mentioned as possible candidates. While all of them are respected and comfortable in their current roles, the enticement of heading a large-scale and storied athletic program at USC may be convincing.
A couple of weeks ago, reports surfaced connecting current Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich to the USC job, but Jurich denied interest.
Haden, who was hired as athletic director in August of 2010, will stay at USC for another year to oversee renovations at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

On Sunday afternoon in the Alfred Newman Recital Hall, Thornton School of Music keyboard studies professor Daniel Pollack performed a piano recital as part of the Thornton School of Music Faculty Recital Series. The performance featured works by Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt, Gian Carlo Menotti, Sergei Prokofiev and the world premiere of a new piece by Lalo Schifrin. Pollack’s performance marks the first of the three-part series of faculty recitals hosted by Thornton. Thornton’s faculty recital series showcases music professors across multiple instruments and specialties.
Pollack came with his virtuosic tendencies fully intact for the evening’s performance. Beginning the concert with three pieces by Chopin — “Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor”, “Nocturne in D-flat major” and “Polonaise-Fantasie in A-flat major” — Pollack was able to display his high value for precision balanced with artistic sensibility. His performance allowed Chopin’s works to flow naturally through the piano while keeping precise restraint on the musical passages. His dramatic range, not only between movements but also within each movement, proved to be impressive. Some phrases, however, seemed rehearsed and forced without natural inclination but were nonetheless balanced with spirit and exuberance in other areas.
The hall was full, with few, if any, seats to spare, which can likely be traced to the world premiere of Schifrin’s “Malabo con Brilo.” Schifrin, a veteran of the film music industry and jazz world, is a longwtime friend of Pollack. Pollack wanted Schifrin to compose, per the concert notes, “a solo piece commemorating the 100th anniversary of the birth of Alberto Ginastera, an Argentine composer” Schifrin, a native of Argentina, was able to use Argentinian influences as a basis for the new piece.
Very contemporary in style, “Malabo con Brilo” used eclectic passages juxtaposed with lyrical phrasing. Postmodern trends and the composer’s jazz background started to show through in the piece, which at times was often hard to grasp. In the spirit of experimentation, merit can be given for the daring directions it took. The piece was in good hands under Pollack’s musicianship performing the piece to the fullest of his abilities, giving “Malambo con Brilo” the world premiere it deserved. Pollack and Schifrin, who was in the audience, were praised with a deserving standing ovation.
The last piece of the evening, “Sonata No. 7” by Russian composer Prokofiev, seemed to be appropriate given Pollack’s background performing in Russia on multiple occasions. Pollack was able to not only hold the technical musicianship needs of the piece to a high standard, but was also able to explore the deepest corners of the piece to bring profound meaning to the performance.
Pollack’s performance marks the first of the three-part series of faculty recitals hosted by the Thornton. Thornton’s faculty recital series showcases music professors in the Thornton School of Music across multiple instruments and specialties.
Thornton faculty, including Margaret Batjer on violin, Andrew Shulman on cello and Jeffrey Kahane on piano will present a chamber music concert on Feb. 22 at 7:30 p.m. in the Alfred Newman Recital Hall. The evening will feature Schubert’s Piano Trio No. 2 and Johannes Brahms’ Piano Trio No. 2.
Pollack’s recital proved to be especially noteworthy given his debut at the age of 14 in the Alfred Newman Recital hall. Pollack spoke to the audience following the concert.
“This hall brings so many memories to me because I made my debut, actually one of many at USC, here when I was 14 years old” Pollack said, “So it is especially emotional for me to play on my own home turf.”
On Feb. 24 at 7:30 pm in the Alfred Newman Recital Hall, keyboard studies faculty lecturer Christine Hye-Su Kim will perform pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Claude Debussy and Chopin.
Further information for all concerts and events offered through Thornton can be found at music.usc.edu/events.

USC students will have the opportunity on Friday to participate in shaping the appearance of miniature libraries that will soon be placed throughout campus. The first part of the event, “Microlibraries in the Everywhere,” will be held at Doheny Memorial Library, room 240 on the University Park Campus.
This innovative walking tour will give a preview into the future of microlibraries that will be dispersed throughout USC’s campus. In promotion of reading for pleasure and gaining information, the microlibraries will also contribute to “moral and ethical dimensions of free access to knowledge.” The exhibit will feature 10 unique and individualized microlibraries created in collaboration with a  USC professor of architecture, Lee Olvera, as well as students in the USC Master of Management in Library and Information Science program and the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study.
Co-creator Professor Olvera’s professional practice currently focuses on the design of arts-related residential projects and his current teaching centers on the topics “of craft and making as an exploration of the return to the value placed on methods of making, the how and why of designed objects, spaces and buildings.” As the associate professor of practice in architecture, Olvera teaches a thesis level design studio class, critical theory and research seminars as well as a class on color theory. Olvera is the assistant dean of communications and special projects, and faculty coordinator for the Graduate Research Scholars Program at the School of Architecture.
Like any library, the microlibraries will be set up with freely available books and other materials completely open to the public. The microlibraries will also serve as an interactive artistic element to USC’s campus, serving a dual purpose of art as well as a public stop for literary resources.
The 10 microlibraries will be separated by the information they provide. They will address questions such as to how the design of a space shape the experience of interacting with information and whether or not a student or any engaged person can determine the truth when given access to information that is censored and mediated.
Olvera, in addition to the Los Angeles-based curators or creators of the microlibraries, will be giving walking tours of the future microlibrary sites. Reservations are required and admission is free and open to USC students, staff, faculty, alumni and the general public.
Part two of this event, “Exhibition Opening and Discussion,” will be held April 5 at 4 p.m. in Doheny Library, room 240. The event will feature a discussion given by Olvera and former senior editor of Capitol Weekly and current State Librarian of California, Greg Lucas.

The Vietnamese Student Association continually strives to increase its visibility as an Asian-American organization on campus. The group adds  dimension to the image of the Asian-American community by bringing mental health issues to the forefront.   This year, they hope to shed light on the existence of  Vietnamese-American students through its annual culture night.
Hosted by USC VSA for the past 38 years, the Vietnamese Culture Night is an annual event that celebrates Vietnamese traditions and culture through the performing arts. This year, the show’s producers will be presenting a play with interludes of Vietnamese music and dance performances. The theme, “Grateful,” strives to send an important message to its viewers on Saturday.
“We wanted to provide a platform for students in the Vietnamese community to speak about their stories and have a place to share their voices,” explained Maitlyn Pham, co-director of VCN. “So, when our entire production team came together, we decided to conceive a universal concept and story that would not only resonate with Vietnamese students, but also the rest of the Asian-American community here at USC.”
After an entire year of exhaustive planning and rehearsals, VSA is ready to showcase its production as the final event of Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s 2016 Heritage Festival. Teresa Pham, co-president of VSA, explains the purpose and mission.
“For us, we hope VCN will bring together members of the Vietnamese student community. VSA is also aiming to use this event as a way to educate people about bicultural issues that are prevalent in the lives of Vietnamese Americans today.”
The production, “Grateful,” presents a touching story about the struggles that protagonist Joy faces in the wake of a family tragedy. Her emotional distress causes a strain between her and the rest of her family, while also affecting her academic life at USC. Through passion and support, the Vietnamese American community comes together to save Joy and her family from the crisis that nearly tears them apart.
Sophomore Beverly Pham, who is playing the lead role of Joy, is excited to play a character with themes so close to her heart.
“It’s been great getting to incorporate a part of my Vietnamese heritage into an American college setting, and I’m excited to share the final product with my fellow Trojans and the Vietnamese community at large,” Pham said.
The show is mainly comprised of members of the organization as well as volunteers who hope to provide an accurate depiction of Vietnamese-American society today.
“This year we will be expecting about 300 members to attend from not only from USC, but also different schools, such as UCLA and UCSB. We really hope that this show will better promote our community on campus and also expose others to the charm of Vietnamese culture. Expect a lot of dancing, maybe tears, and prepare to be amazed!” said Pham.
The 38th Vietnamese Culture Night will be hosted on Saturday at  6 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. It will be free and open to the general public.
This is a positive step for all, because being an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

Last weekend, I attended a performance of Mozart’s The Magic Flute at LA Opera. For those well versed in classical music, praise for The Magic Flute usually stems from the tenderness and superiority of its part writing, rather than it’s subpar and slightly misogynistic plotline, as is the case with most of Mozart’s operas.  With this in mind, seldom will you ever find a classical musician that doesn’t have some sort of opinion on Mozart.
Following the performance, a friend who sang in the production invited me to an after-party hosted by the opera. Though I was tired and still a bit tipsy from the free cocktails that I sipped during intermission, I accepted my friend’s invitation.
The after-party was a grand spectacle, the hor d’oeuvres were gourmet, the drinks delicious, and everyone was elegantly garbed in formal attire. Though I felt a bit out of place in a black polo and a cardigan, I took advantage of the opportunity to meet as many people as I could.
Later in the evening, I had the pleasure of meeting a singer who performed one of the lead roles in the production. She was calm and collected, exuding serenity rather than a diva-esque air that is stereotypical of  opera singers. We spent a majority of the night talking, and it was only in the latter half of the evening that we made the connection that we were both raised within the same religion, the Bahá’í Faith.
For most people, this revelation isn’t exactly a momentous occasion. However, I was flabbergasted at this association, as the Bahá’í Faith remains mostly unknown to the general public. Founded in 19th-century Persia, the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith focus on the oneness of mankind through unity of religion, race, culture and diversity.
There are many elements to this religion that I find utterly beautiful, necessary and relevant to today’s culture. However, like all systems of faith, there are some holes in the Bahá’í Faith’s teachings that contradict with its overall message.
As a gay man, my issues regarding this religion stem from its unfriendly attitude toward the LGBT community. Like most LGBT youth, I struggled to find a place within the world I was raised in. Unlike most religions, which are divided between various sects of elucidation, the Bahá’í Faith doesn’t leave much wiggle room for personal interpretation of the religious text. As a Bahá’í, I wasn’t encouraged to find my own path or discover myself; rather, I was on a path of blind obligatory faith. As I got older, I felt direct pressure to choose between my faith and my sexuality. It seems like there was only one way to be a Bahá’í, almost in the same way that there seems to be only one way to perform Mozart correctly.
Being both a former musician and Bahá’í, I find many similarities between Mozart and Bahá’í Faith; or rather, I find the similarities in their respective performance practices. For all intents and purposes, Mozart’s music remains as a blueprint for precision in the music world; that’s why so many young musicians begin their studies with Mozart. The ability to perform Mozart correctly requires meticulousness and dedication. The musicians aren’t necessarily assessed for their beauty or purity of tone, but rather their ability to attain a particular accuracy required to phrase each passage cleanly and correctly.
On the same token, as a Bahá’í, I felt as though I was being judged for my actions rather than for the purity of my being. When I decided to formally leave the Bahá’í Faith, I expected to feel some sort of remorse or emptiness. Instead, I felt free. I finally felt that I was able to live my life without the constraints of a 200-year-old holy text.
As my evening at the opera came to an end, I felt as if everything had come full circle for me. Though I no longer identify as a Bahá’í, I still feel some sort of connection to the religion as a whole. Likewise, though I no longer actively perform, my inherent love for classical music will always remain.
Though it may be a bit of a stretch to compare religion and Mozartean performance practices, I wish to emphasize that beauty triumphs stern discipline.

Last week, Harvard graduate Alyssa Leader filed a lawsuit against her alma mater claiming that the university failed to abide by Title IX, showing “deliberate indifference” to her reports of sexual assault, abuse and harassment.
Unfortunately, Leader isn’t alone. The sobering fact that one in four women will experience sexual assault at some point in her college career unfortunately hasn’t improved in recent years. Neither has the fact that 20 percent of college students identified sexual misconduct as an extremely problematic issue on their campuses. This figure is succeeded by  nearly 30 percent of female USC students who have experienced sexual assault at our university, according to the campus climate survey.
Given these studies, as well as the numerous reports of sexual misconduct from students at colleges across the nation, it is clear that we must alter the ways in which we address sexual assault on college campuses. And perhaps one of the best and most expedient ways to do this is through the development of university police department units dedicated exclusively to sexual assault cases.
Presently, the way universities are tasked with addressing sexual misconduct on campus as required by federal law is inadequate. From the failure to address students’ needs to the underreporting of sexual assault cases, universities nationwide have been under heavy scrutiny. But this doesn’t mean that universities can’t and shouldn’t be involved in dealing with cases of sexual assault. In fact, both university administrations and police departments               — such as USC’s Department of Public Safety —            are uniquely qualified to address the needs of their campus and their students. Though USC already has a task force focused on sexual misconduct prevention — which consists of five committees focused on issues including sexual assault policy and gender violence — this is a far cry from a special task force within DPS itself, which is tasked with conducting sexual assault investigations. Given its knowledge of both the student body and the campus as a whole, every university’s DPS-counterpart should establish a special task force dedicated to addressing issues of sexual misconduct on campus.
Universities aren’t just bound by the law to provide a safe academic space for their students — they are paid to do so. Each year, we as students pay thousands of dollars in tuition which goes, in part, to campus security. Students can and should expect that they are paying for both a quality education and a safe academic environment, and universities have an obligation to provide both.
Though some might argue that cases of sexual misconduct are best left to the police, such an attitude fails to address the criminal justice system’s own limitations and failures with regard to addressing cases of sexual assault. The fact is that only a small fraction of victims come forward and report sexual assault. Of these few, even fewer turn to the criminal justice system in fear of skepticism, abuse or retaliation. This reality is made worse by the fact that the criminal justice system isn’t infallible. According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, approximately 32 of every 100 rapes are reported to the police, and of which only seven lead to arrest, three to prosecution and two to conviction. Leaving students with only one course of action such as relying on the Los Angeles Police Department isn’t a solution that best serves students.
The criminal justice system isn’t just imperfect — it is also slow. Whereas police investigations take time and don’t always address the immediate needs of the victim, universities have the unique ability to act significantly faster to ensure the well-being of their students. This includes everything from providing academic accommodations such as dorm or class transfers to more serious action, including the suspension or expulsion of the offenders.
And just as the criminal justice system isn’t perfect, neither are the laws that govern it. Some states have yet to acknowledge survivors of sexual assault committed by women or by individuals of the same gender as victims of an actual crime. Universities, however, are legally obligated to address every reported case of sexual assault, regardless of who the offender or the victim is. By removing universities from the equation, we could also be removing a student’s only resource.
Universities’ approaches to dealing with sexual assault is not perfect — far from it. Neither, unfortunately, is the approach of local law enforcement. But universities owe it to their students to do more to properly and expediently address cases of sexual assault, as opposed to simply leaving the job to the police. Students deserve to have more than one resource at their disposal — including their universities. With one in four students at risk, one resource simply isn’t enough.

For matters of funding and classroom equality, Title IX provides absolutely vital protection for fair representation. The interpretation of Title IX has expanded to urge universities to be the primary actors against sexual assault and domestic violence on campus as well, with increasing numbers of cases of rape and sexual battery being reported solely to universities, resulting in disciplinary action. However, this trend has culminated in a series of grievous injustices, both for the victims of assault and the falsely accused.
In a recent case at Harvard University, undergraduate Alyssa Leader faced consistent violence, including physical and verbal threats and sexual coercion from her boyfriend. Leader’s official report to the university for abuse, sexual assault and harassment was answered with an informal moderation — not a notification of her legal rights to pursue a criminal case or obtain a restraining order —in a distinct violation of Title IX.
The common occurrence of university misconduct like Harvard’s and USC’s own atrocious history of mishandling assault and abuse reports begs the question of why so many victims of these violent crimes choose not to report them to the police, instead opting to inform only university officials or no one at all.
In 2000, the Department of Justice found that fewer than 5 percent of female college rape victims reported their attempted or completed assaults to the police. The same study found that 39.8 percent of women did not report their rapes because they did not want their families to know, and 41.6 percent did not because they did not want any other people to know. The statistics for the reporting of intimate partner violence on college is incredibly sparse. The limited data we do have reveals that intimate partner violence occurs nearly as prevalently as sexual assault on campus, yet dating violence receives a far smaller share of attention from campus activists.
We can deduce from these statistics that fear of the culturally pervasive stigma of being a sexual assault and abuse victim drives students to choose to report these violent crimes to universities instead of the actual authorities. This trend repeatedly obstructs justice for both the accused and the victim.
Given that university administrators are not professionally trained prosecutors or detectives, cases of sexual assault and dating violence often mishandle evidence, mitigating the cases actual victims have and leading to public witch hunts as the Columbia  University“Mattress Girl” case did, even after Paul Nungesser was found innocent by the university’s investigation. Twice.
This precedent implies that a heinous, potentially life-ruining crime such as sexual and physical assault can be tried alongside victimless charges such as plagiarism. When colleges encourage students to report their assaults to their authorities instead of the actual authorities, they are saying that the perpetrators deserve expulsion, not prison.
Because the overwhelming majority of college rapes and, by definition, all cases of dating violence, happen with acquaintances, activists in favor of colleges controlling the justice process often argue that leaving the police out of it is a way to encourage victims to seek some justice if they are hesitant to “ruin their assaulter’s life.” This rationale enables  the exact modus operandi of rapists and abusers. Rapists and abusers want to use shame to silence their victims.
Obviously, the stigma against rape and abuse is in no way the fault of their victims; however, in immediately reporting these crimes to police and seeking real and fair justice, they can be an integral part of the solution. Rapists and abusers must know that if they can commit monstrous acts of inhumanity, they will be punished justly.
We need to stop encouraging men and women who become the victims of violent crimes to treat them like petty university disputes. It is time for us to accept that university administrators are not a court of law and are unable to properly carry out a dignified and honest ruling of justice.

What about those who falsely accuse people of rape?
Please provide credible evidence for the ‘increasing numbers of cases of rape and sexual battery being reported solely to universities’.  They may be being reported but how many of them stand up to the rigour of the ‘law’ and how many are morning after ‘regrets’?
I agree with Tiana, but she was vague and weak in her indirect approach. She needed to state unequivocally and directly that “victims of rape and physical abuse need to report the crimes promptly to the police.”  Look through her article. She never says that. It should appear in the first and last paragraphs.
Her main point is that universities shouldn’t be handling the cases. Universities encourage reporting to them and discourage reporting to the police. That’s the problem, and that’s what she unequivocally and directly stated.
I agree, Selam. You are correct. That was clearly stated. She just failed to write that victims should call the police themselves, and promptly, rather than mess around with inept or fussy college administrators.

I met this amazing guy while studying abroad last year, but there was no expectation for anything serious because I’d have to go back to America. I recently saw him again during a family trip to Europe, and our feelings are still there, stronger than ever! We have an undeniable connection, but I have had bad experiences with long distance in the past … I am planning on moving to Europe this summer regardless, but I don’t want to lose him before then due to my commitment issues. What do I do?
It’s perfectly reasonable that you’re hesitant to do long distance if you’ve been burned in the past. But, as you’ve alluded to, you can’t expect him to just twiddle his thumbs and wait around for you either. So, why not tell him where you’re at and let him decide how to feel about it? Honesty, man, honesty.
Telling someone how strongly you feel for them can be scary, but the worst result is a chip to your ego if the feelings are unreciprocated. Even then, this knowledge would allow you to focus on moving on. If this gent is really worthy of your pining, he will have the emotional capacity to have a frank conversation about your predicament.
I advise to take it day by day and resist trying to plan your life too far in advance. When you see him again, maybe you will be in a place where you both feel like a relationship is feasible. Despite the passage of time, an incredible connection can’t be shaken off too easily.

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays. 
I was talking to Dan on Tinder. A witty back and forth. I’m good at that. We were joking about a Greek myth. “So,” he writes. “Can I ask you a question?”
I lock my phone screen, inhale and exhale. “Don’t even respond,” I tell myself. “You know where this is going.” Yet part of me wants to hear it. How will this guy phrase it? How will Dan stack up to Mike, and Joe and Jack?
I remember all of them vividly. There’s no rulebook on how to set up a dating app profile when you’re two months out of chemotherapy.
Stephen’s pickup line was, “Are you still fighting cancer?” That same night my roommate matched with him. She just got the word “sexy.” I would have preferred that more commonplace objectification.
The best interaction was with John. He sent me three messages in a row after exchanging an initial “hey” and “what’s up.” “Are you ok already???” he asked, followed by “What stage was it?” A pause. “If you don’t mind me asking.” Not cute, John. I did mind, but I said yes, it was cancer, and yes, I’m fine. There’s no official playbook, but I try to tend to stick with honesty as much as possible. “Ughh can I virtually hug you!!!” he writes back. “Just want to say how strong you are and how in love I am.”
Suffice it to say, when a guy now leads up to asking me “a question” on Tinder, I recoil. But I still wanted to see what Dan would have to say. It’s been seven months now since I stopped treatment. My profile says nothing, but all it would take would be a quick peek at my Instagram to figure out why I have a cropped haircut. So I let him ask.
“Finger painting or watercolors?” That’s it.
Am I relieved?
Every day in the mirror I see the ghost of a thinner, wavy haired version of myself. I was the girl who had nothing to write on the Common App because my life had gone so relatively smoothly. By 19, I realized cancer had been slowly destroying my body for two years and moved home to undergo six months of brutal treatment. I see these experiences everywhere, but I don’t look like a St. Jude’s commercial anymore. Grasping that people don’t automatically notice I’m a cancer survivor has been difficult to process.
I wear my survivorship proudly, but dating becomes difficult. The first guy I kissed after treatment was someone I had known from before but ran into at a bar. I was wearing my wig. I told him I wouldn’t go home with him. My recent breakup wasn’t a decent enough reason to him. Only telling him I was just out of chemotherapy stopped his persistence in his tracks.
I kissed a boy at a Halloween party, too. I was wearing a costume wig. It fell off while he was kissing me. We laughed it off. I couldn’t go without a wig again for almost a month.
I’ll answer anyone if they ask. But I’ve been in desperate need of a break.
Josh and I texted for two weeks before we met, and it never came up.  We met at a bakery, and I let him tell me stories. I stroked on black winged eyeliner and wore a tube skirt and a top that covered my scars. We talked and took a walk holding hands. Instead of asking me where I was a year ago (answer: probably in the hospital), he asked me what kind of bird I would be. He liked that my answer was chickadee. I liked that he didn’t suspect the real reason for my relentless positivity.
I like Josh because he’s funny and sweet and tall and he looks like a young Matthew Morrison with better bone structure. I also like him because he’s seen my Instagram and kissed my scars and hasn’t asked for more. I like that he buries his head in my hair and doesn’t need me to tell him why I cut it.
I read somewhere that you’re less likely to be hired by a company if you admit in the interview that you have a history of cancer. Until recently, I’ve been having that sort of luck with dates.
I was in love a year ago. When the relationship ended, I only cried for a day. But one sentiment frightened me more than any other: the man I will one day marry will not have known me when I had cancer. Would I ever be able to reach a level of intimacy with someone so deep that I could explain to them the depths of the suffering I had experienced at a mere 19 years old?
With Josh I’ve learned something beautiful and new. I’ve learned that at this point, I don’t particularly care. Josh has taught me that there might still be men out there who care more about knowing what makes me smile than knowing the details of my medical history. There are men who will want to linger on the curves of my hips, not the edges of my scars. Life is unpredictable and crazy and I will never know how long I have left, but I now know that I can be kissed and held and told I’m beautiful without any hint of cancer voyeurism.
Whomever I fall in love with next will have to understand that, around me, he can never complain about birthdays or getting older. He can never light a cigarette. He will have to wear sunscreen and get vaccinated. But he will also have the pleasure of my enduring optimism and my relentless strength. And when he says to me “can I ask a question?” hopefully I won’t flinch. I’ll answer honestly, and that will be enough.

If you couldn’t tell by the SoCal weather refusing to make up its mind about being hot or cold, rainy or sunny, rest assured, spring is right around the corner.
Though spring is just a few weeks away, midterm season chooses to rear its ugly head to stay as an unwelcomed guest. This is winter’s last flip of the bird before it goes away, adding to its list of things that make it the worst season out of the year. The last few days of winter aren’t something to look forward to, especially with all of the studying, cramming and panicking, but music usually helps alleviate some of the stress. These songs will hopefully get you thinking about spring while you’re studying and remind you to stop and smell the soon-to-be roses in a few weeks.
After all, spring is tied for my favorite season out of the year for a lot of reasons. Just to name a few:
1. It definitely makes a strong case for being the best-looking season out of all of them. All of the flowers blooming makes it impossible not to brighten up during the day.
2. The weather is just right — not too warm, not too cold. There’s also a good mix of rainy and sunny days, so each day has an element of surprise to it. It could be sunny when you’re walking to class and then suddenly be in the middle of a downpour when you’re leaving.
3. It’s the most uplifting of all the seasons. The cold and dark winter is seeing it’s last days, and daylight savings is a godsend that everyone can appreciate. Back in my hometown, spring is a crowd-favorite, since it meant that the temperature would at least be above zero degrees, and the sun would stay up past three p.m.
No matter where you’re from, spring never fails to lift a weight off of your shoulders and brighten everyone’s mood. It’s also the time for new beginnings, which is applicable to just about anything and everything. My only complaint with this magical season is that it’s too short, and just as soon as it comes, it leaves.
With winter out of the way, spring means that everyone’s in the homestretch for the school year, because everything after spring break always flies by, but we’re not out of the woods yet.

The Marshall Business of Entertainment Association hosted its 9th annual flagship event, the Evolution of Entertainment (E2) conference, on Friday. The conference featured keynote speakers and panelists from the media industry, and saw nearly five hundred attendees, making it the largest student-run event on campus. 
The theme this year was the business of virtual reality, and as a result, the event featured 16 exhibitors, including 14 from the VR entertainment business, who displayed their models of VR gadgets for the public. The event was sponsored by Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., OnPrem Solution Partners LLC, AT&T and Cognizant Business Consulting.
Vicki Beck, an executive at Lucasfilm focusing on ILMxLAB, delivered a keynote speech, walking the audience through the real-time computer graphics system intended to transform content creation in the VR media industry. Afterwards, panelists from different areas of the VR field talked about their experiences in the industry as well as their vision for what VR can accomplish. 
“It’s a multi-channel business creating varied levels of business opportunities among clients, digital marketers, brands, advertisers and early stage companies,” said Carl Weinstein, an independent consultant in Los Angeles. 
Lucas Wilson, a virtual reality producer at Jaunt Studios, said that VR can be used to enhance the special effects for films and TV shows to provide viewers with an entirely new way to immerse themselves in the world of the screen.
“It’s a new Hollywood experience,” said Wilson. 
The event also featured panelist Shannon Gans, a USC alumna and CEO of New Deal Studios. Gans’ career has included her work in creating visual effects for over 150 films and commercials, including Interstellar. She was also named Alumni Entrepreneur of the Year by the USC Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in 2000. Gans said that her experiences in the entertainment industry have brought her to accept VR as a new and growing medium. 
“It’s remarkable to focus on the creative edge of VR, and it’s booming as ever,” Gans said.
Ted Schilowitz, a futurist at 20th Century Fox, closed the conference by describing what he sees as the future of VR. He brought up 360 degree video as an example, citing the popularity of this new medium in everything from music videos to instructional films as proof of how far VR has come, but also how far it has to go. 
“It’s opening up a universe of education with more intense, more realistic wide applications to be considered,” Schilowitz said. “360 [degree video] is just the beginning of the journey.”
