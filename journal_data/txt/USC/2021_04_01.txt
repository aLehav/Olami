For some background,“Kamen Rider Kuuga” is a Japanese Tokusatsu show featuring superheroes and special effects, and is one of the first installments of the series in the Hesei Era of Japan (The Heisei era is the period of Japanese history corresponding to the reign of Emperor Akihito from Jan. 8, 1989 until his abdication April 30, 2019). The Toei Company produced the show in 2000 but released it in the United States just last year in May 2020. 
I recently decided to look back to this old show to appreciate the themes found within its story. With 49 episodes and a short running time of 20 minutes for each, only some of the main plot points will be reviewed below to emphasize the theme of fighting for others’ happiness rather than simply the happiness of oneself. Episodes of this show can be found on YouTube and on the ShoutFactoryTV site. 
“Kamen Rider Kuuga” revolves around the hero, Kuuga, fighting monsters known as the Grongi. They are, in reality, an ancient tribe of people that terrorized the ancestors of modern-day humans in the show’s universe. They end up returning after being sealed away by the ancient warrior Kuuga. 
Some of the main characters who try to help stop the Grongi consist of Godai Yusuke, aka the new Kamen Rider Kuuga, and Kaoru Ichijo, an officer of the Science Police force who works with Kuuga. Some of the main antagonists include N-Daguva, the strongest of the Grongi, and Ra-Baruba-De, the judge of the Grongi’s “game.” This lethal game developed by the Grongi is the central conflict of the series as it showcases the pain that can be inflicted on others when fighting for happiness. 
Starting with Ichijo, he experiences the distorted views of the villains first-hand when working with his fellow officers to fight an invisible Grongi in episode 22, “Game.” The Grongi describes his happiness with killing people, stating that it’s “fun.”  In the same episode, Ichijo encounters one of the leaders of the Grongi, Ra-Baruba-De, who states that the humans they faced long ago have now changed. This is explained later in the series with how humanity is still fighting with one another even without the Grongi, despite the fact the Grongi were defeated to avoid such violence. Thus, the show does well in setting up ideas such as, “If violence is needed to stop violence, how does it stop?”
This connects to the main protagonist, Godai Yusuke, who is a carefree individual who can be considered a paragon character (a type of hero that is regarded as the “ultimate” champion of concepts, such as truth, justice and honor) in regards to fighting for the smiles of others — making certain that later events are even more impactful. 
Such events include episode 35, “Emotion,” where Yusuke fights a Grongi hunting and hurting school kids for fun. Yusuke, aka Kuuga, becomes overcome by rage at the number of people he hasn’t been able to save from the previous episodes. Pushed by the fears of the student he is trying to guard, Godai fights against this Grongi.
Not letting up, Kuuga continues punching the Grongi and uses a large amount of his arsenal against him. The music becomes eerie, indicating that Kuuga is now the hunter but at the same time emphasizes the emotional pain Godai feels. This scene highlights how the powers of Kuuga can go either way — as a light or a threat to his own happiness. 
In episode 41, “Control,” there is further emphasis on how Yusuke doesn’t enjoy hurting others, despite his similar powers to the Grongi. Even though each fight makes him stronger, by helping him achieve new evolutions and gain new weapons, the changes on his body are a growing concern for his friends. His body is healing faster, and his friends’ concerns about the future are actually a set up for the dangerous powers he would soon obtain, putting his own humanity to the challenge, as witnessed from a vision in episode 35, where he is shown as an “ultimate warrior.” 
However, in this episode, when one of Yusuke’s friends has vengeful thoughts on someone, he states:
“Well, that just shows you’re human.”
Thus, Godai is aware he can’t always forget about those violent thoughts but instead strives to avoid escalating the problem, even when he believes he is in the right: fighting evil. This mindset contributes to the theme of striving to fight for others rather than not caring about the consequences of one’s actions like the Grongi. This all comes to a conclusion in Yusuke’s battle with N Daguva, the series’s main antagonist. 
To defeat Daguva, Yusuke has to become an “ultimate warrior,” taking on a role that contrasts his personality. Ichijo, who is by Yusuke’s side before the fight, states he didn’t want to see Yusuke go down this path, but Yusuke, following the show’s theme, stays true to himself. 
Yusuke states he made the right choice and was glad to meet Ichijo. This scene involves parallels from episode 1 as Yusuke asks Ichijo to watch his transformation yet again. This bears great contrast to Daguva, who constantly laughs from enjoyment regarding the Grongi’s game and the destruction he causes for others. 
Daguva is also glad that Yusuke obtained powers similar to him, but Yusuke eventually survives with his mind still intact. Yusuke’s journey through his evolutions helps emphasize how using violence for one’s happiness should not overtake the happiness obtained from other people. 
Overall, “Kuuga” does a nice job expressing how there are both similarities and contrasts between the main characters and the villains when fighting for happiness. Nevertheless, there is still the important theme of striving toward peace despite the presence of harsh reality.

Cecilia Nguyen and her three housemates were stranded in Death Valley, Calif., earlier this year. They had decided it would be an ideal camping location for the winter storm passing through the southern part of the state. Despite this, their lighter fell ill to 20 mile per hour winds, leaving them unable to start a fire for warmth. Luckily, they had camping kits that contained a small stove that they used to light a fire. 
Nguyen, a senior majoring in psychology, received the kits through Peaks and Professors, a student organization founded in 2013 with the goal of making the outdoors more accessible. The organization’s president, Colleen Corrigan, created the kits earlier this year to make camping and other outdoor activities more available to first generation and underrepresented students at USC. 
“Transportation and access to gear is a huge issue,” said Corrigan, a senior majoring in human biology and non-governmental organizations and social change and a graduate studying public health. “There’s sort of an elite attitude about the outdoors sometimes, and that just doesn’t bode well with our mission and how we feel about trying to get students outside. We’re really excited to hopefully help break down that barrier.”
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, trip leads that volunteered for the organization would be in charge of guiding students along weekly hikes and camping trips in the Los Angeles area. 
“Our mission is really to help students to get outside and enjoy Southern California wilderness,” Corrigan said. “But our unique twist is that we do bring a professor on all of our trips.”
By bringing along a USC professor, students get the chance to see their instructors outside of the classroom and can have extensive discussions about topics outside of their major or academic interests. Nguyen, who went on a trip with Peaks and Professors to Catalina Island during her sophomore year, saw a different side of her chemistry professor who went on the trip. 
“The boat ride to the island itself was so fun because we were just sitting in a circle talking with our professor, and I got to see [her in] a different light that I had never seen her with,” Nguyen said. “She brought her fiance, and it was really funny because her fiance was talking about how he failed chemistry in high school.”
In a regular school year, Peaks and Professors offer at least one trip per week. Some of the trips are hikes, like at Three T’s Trail in Mt. Baldy, and some are camping trips, such as Nguyen’s experience at Catalina Island. This trip was Nguyen’s first time camping with minimal equipment.
“I wish I did more of those … trips,” Nguyen said. “They had one like every weekend, and I didn’t know about it until too late, and then before we knew it, COVID hit, so I’m trying to recreate that in going camping now.”
When trying to plan an excursion with her housemates, Nguyen said she planned to reach out to Peaks and Professors for a tent and other necessary camping gear. However, as she was combing through her inbox she was met instead with an email from the organization offering members camping supplies. She filled out the form mentioned in the email and left her contact information. 
“They emailed me back like that same morning within five hours, which was incredible,” Nguyen said.
To receive a kit, students needed to fill out a Google Form that asks about students’ past experience with camping and the logistics of their trip. Peaks and Professors then contacted the student to see if they have any questions and to work out the logistics of the trip. For Nguyen, she said her experience with getting the supplies was a positive one. 
Corrigan was inspired to create the kits last fall after she saw activist Mo Jackson’s fundraiser providing camping gear to Black and Indigenous people and people of color who could otherwise not afford the equipment. The form to receive the kits also asked if the student was a first generation college student, Black and Indigenous people and people of color or of an underrepresented group. Because Peaks and Professors had to cancel all of their trips, they decided to focus their energy on making the wilderness community more inclusive at USC.
“We’ve been having conversations to try and consider the whiteness and privilege of the outdoors in general, and we wanted to spend this year … [focusing] on increasing access to the outdoors, just because everyone deserves to enjoy that and I think now more so than ever we all need it,” Corrigan said. 
To receive funding for the kits, Corrigan applied for a microgrant from the USC Well-being Collective, a group consisting of different student organizations around campus, along with certain health-oriented campus departments. 
“Essentially, our office works with these different key stakeholders across campus to improve well-being within their own sphere of influence,” said Andrea Moore, a health promotion specialist at USC Student Health, whose office supports the collective . “So, I work primarily with student organizations in enhancing student well-being for their membership.”
The collective has a variety of focus areas, including mental health, thriving and equity and inclusion, that are often key components of projects it supports. The premise of the kits stood out to Moore because of the project’s alignment with these goals. 
“[Peaks and Professors] is hitting many of those different strategic areas,” Moore said. “They’re getting students outside, which is wonderful for people’s mental health, and their specific project is about supporting low income students to be able to have access to those types of opportunities.”
Peaks and Professors is now looking forward to planning additional virtual events and fundraising for resources to create additional kits. Upon receiving the grant, Corrigan said she is grateful for the support. 
“It’s really just an affirmation of the work that we always do and the importance, I think now more so than ever, that we can’t have trips,” Corrigan said. “It was disheartening for sure because that’s our main programming, but to have the support of the University in some way shows that they are trying to support students, and they recognize that, even during COVID, there’s a real need and desire to get outside and enjoy nature.”

Cities across the country want to be the established sports capital of the United States.
For God knows what reason, Indianapolis was considered the “sports capital” for a period of time. Then, of course, Boston had a say too, winning 12 championships across four major professional sports since 2000.  
Now, the question over who the title belongs to shouldn’t be a debate: Los Angeles is the sports capital of the country, and it’s not even close.
Both the Lakers and the Dodgers winning the title last year makes a strong case for the city already, but the performances of USC and UCLA men’s basketball in March Madness this year have brought about a special buzz.
It’s a brand of basketball that made Bill Walton even prouder than usual to hail the Pac-12 the “Conference of Champions.” 
Whether I like it or not, UCLA basketball’s run in March Madness is too impressive and improbable for me not to discuss it. I’ll start with the Bruins just to get it out of the way since they truly do deserve credit.
UCLA had a tough basketball season. High expectations and even a national ranking in the middle of the season came crashing down after a poor end to the regular season.
The Bruins were in prime position to win the Pac-12 before dropping key games to Oregon and Colorado on the road and then ultimately losing to USC because of a buzzer-beater from redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy. Then, they lost the first game in the Pac-12 tournament to add insult to injury.
Things were looking bleak for the boys in Westwood. They were forced to win a play-in game during the first four matchups against Michigan State just to get into March Madness and stay alive. 
Not only did the Bruins win the game in overtime, they proceeded to take down BYU, Abilene Christian, second-seeded Alabama and first-seeded Michigan to reach their first Final Four since 2008. 
By making the Final Four, they also became the first team out of the first four play-in games to do so since Virginia Commonwealth University in 2011.
In a normal year of college basketball, UCLA making an unlikely run to the Final Four is enough to steal all the glitter in Tinseltown. 
Nevertheless, USC basketball was starving for some hype themselves.
I’ve covered this team since the very beginning, extremely eager to see what could possibly be the outcome of the season. I told friends and colleagues that this team was special and a deep March Madness run could be possible.
But I never could have expected the season to play out like this.
From the two-week coronavirus pause to the nearly two months of dominant Pac-12 conference play, the entire year has been remarkable. It’s no debate at this point that this is one of — if not the — best basketball teams USC has ever put together.
As a fan, I’ll miss their camaraderie on and off the court, their grinding defensive effort and unbelievable talent ranging from players like 7-foot freshman forward Evan Mobley to 5-foot-7 junior guard Amar Ross.
Not to mention how fun it was to watch the Mobley brothers take over games and watch the immense contributions from transfers like redshirt senior guard Isaiah White, senior forward Chevez Goodwin and junior guard Drew Peterson. 
Even though there were some bumps in the road this was not like any other year of basketball. No matter the challenge or the obstacle, the Trojans shocked us and showed up when the stakes were high.
It’s eerily similar to UCLA’s own season.
The Bruins fell early with their top scorer senior guard Chris Smith going out with a torn ACL in January. Then, redshirt junior forward Jalen Hill began sitting out the season due to “personal reasons” in early February, diminishing the height of the Bruins frontcourt.
It would’ve been easy to just pack up and build for next season. But, UCLA and USC moved forward with what they had and made deep postseason runs out of it.
For USC, they battled the analysts who said they’re not for real and just a fluke. Being in the Pac-12 and part of a school known for its football isn’t an ideal situation. But they used it as fuel, shocking the doubters and showing what this basketball program is capable of.
The resilience of both teams resulted in L.A. booming with outstanding basketball all over. In a city with the Clippers, Lakers and Sparks, it’s the student-athletes that have stolen the headlines this month.
With close matchups in recent years between the two schools’ football, basketball and water polo teams, the rivalry is as heated as ever. And with USC beating the Bruins in a dramatic fashion the last two seasons, it might be a better rivalry compared to its football counterpart.
So often the schools are divided by alumni bragging about each school and diminishing the accomplishments of the other; it’s time they realize just how similar the schools really are and how huge of an impact they’ve made together. 
Growing up, it was all about USC football and the stars that came and went. The basketball program was not mentioned often in L.A. — it was almost always UCLA first. As I began my academic career at USC, all I heard about was the potential of the football team. 
I on the other hand was more interested in the Mobley brothers and how the basketball season would play out. And in my first year at USC, there really could not have been a better team to cover and follow as a beat writer and fan. The team quickly became one of my all-time favorites to watch and made my experience as a sports journalist at USC as memorable as possible.
L.A. is simply the city of basketball. It’s just a shame no one could see it come together in person.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve heard about the most recent attacks on members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community across this country. What people are failing to realize is that this is not new. 
According to Stop AAPI Hate, an organization thatfocuses on addressing anti-Asian discrimination during the pandemic, there have been 3,795 reported incidents of racism and discrimination committed against Asian Americans across the United States between March 19, 2020 and Feb. 28, 2021. Taking into account general mistrust in the police and the tendency toward underreporting incidents, this is most likely an underrepresentation. 
Let that sink in. 
While the perpetrators of these heinous attacks are of various ethnic backgrounds, a troubling trend has arisen in recent reporting which hyper focuses on instances of Black on Asian crime specifically. This reads as an attempt to lessen blame on white supremacy while feeding into the trope of Black-Asian conflict for the sake of sensationalism.
Throughout this country, there is the false belief that gains for one means loss for another. This zero-sum ideology is the biggest threat to people of color advancement; it sets us as competitors against each other for the goal of ‘success’ when, in reality, how do we define success? Economic and social equity — or more simply, that stuff that white people have had access to this whole time. 
There’s so much language about taking, stealing, tricking — opportunities, jobs, money, business, prosperity, happiness. This type of language can be found in former President Donald Trump’s speeches from the past year, where he repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic. Before that, he blamed Latinx people for high unemployment rates. 
In this way, immigrants are classified as foreign, and anything done against them is retribution for a crime already committed. Even if this particular individual is not the one who supposedly ‘stole all the jobs,’ they are taken to be representative of the entire community. This rhetoric leads to hate and ultimately the influx of inexcusable violence that we’ve seen committed against the Asian American community. 
It’s important to note that the AAPI community is extremely diverse; the East Asian experience is not the same as the South Asian experience is not the same as the Central Asian experience is not the same as the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander experience. Add to this the differing socio-political climates of the U.S. and the generation gap in ideology, and you’re left with a very complicated situation.
Simply put, Asian people were encouraged to immigrate to this country under the pretense of more opportunities. The reality is that the white man wanted a cheap labor force to replace the newly emancipated — and growing — Black population. First the Chinese, then the Japanese, then Koreans and so on and so forth, each wave was brought in to replace the workforce that came before. 
Influenced by xenophobia, imperialism, fears of the Red Wave and plain ole racism, white U.S. sought only to profit off of the labor of people of color at the lowest possible cost. Whether intentionally or not, the selective and systemic discrimination of people of color communities has set us against each other, to the point where we see each other as competitors for the shared goal of basic human rights.
The 60’s saw the height of the civil rights movement and the creation of the ‘model minority’ myth. In UC Berkeley sociology professor William Petersen’s 1966 New York Times article, he used the phrase to argue that Asians — by hard work, dedication to traditional family structures and the rule of law — had succeeded over African Americans in reaching economic and social equality. 
This implication that Black people don’t value or practice the aforementioned qualities has cemented into stereotypes of both communities perpetuated today. Keep in mind, this all came from a man (who’s white), which was then circulated by the media (also white), which then trickled down into consumers’ waiting mouths to be regurgitated as supposed fact.
Generations of misinformation have compounded into this monster of division that we are now faced with. A large part of this is due to the ongoing campaign of cultural misrepresentation in public media. Film, news, television — all aspects of U.S. pop culture are stained with racist representations of Asian and Black people. This tainted media landscape is then digested by people at home and abroad, creating false images and feeding into power-based biases. 
The recent string of hate crimes against members of the AAPI community has exposed the longstanding gaps in media coverage of people of color issues. Just as George Floyd wasn’t the first to be murdered by police using the knee-on-neck hold and Breonna Taylor’s was not the first house entered without a warrant, this is not the first time Asian Americans have been targeted or used as a scapegoat. Yet this is what current reporting would have you believe: all of a sudden, Asians are being attacked. 
Despite this being blatantly untrue, it makes sense. No matter their ideological leanings, news outlets are biased. Not only do people push their own agendas, they are ultimately controlled by money — professional journalists don’t write for free. That means their work — which we take as truth — is controlled by people who don’t have the people’s best interests at heart. Ultimately, the news we watch has an agenda, which is to increase viewership.
In the face of this current division, it is important to remember the demonstrations of unity and support between the two communities: Frederick Douglas’ speaking out against the Chinese Exclusion Act, Yuri Kochiyama and Malcolm X’s alliance, Black resistance to the Phillipine-American War and the Vietnam War, AAPI participation in the Black Lives Matter protests.While the model minority is definitely a myth, there is an undeniable privilege that comes with being not-Black. However, this privilege — given by white U.S — only extends to a certain point. We are now at that point. These horrific hate crimes are a wake-up call that, in the end, we are all pawns in the white man’s game. The longer we stand against each other, the longer our goal remains out of reach.

International Women’s Day may have already passed, but I see no reason not to celebrate women every other day of the year as well. This week I’m examining environmental issues from a less-common perspective — gender. Looking at climate change through a gendered lens reveals inequities that may seem unrelated to the untrained eye. However, we would be remiss to consider the outcomes of climate change without acknowledging that some groups are more immediately vulnerable than others. 
If I’m totally honest, I hadn’t heard of the term “ecofeminism” until recently, when I read an article for class. In layman’s terms, it refers to the intersectionality of the feminist and green movements, but, in reality, is much more multifaceted. Ecofeminists see the parallels between the exploitation of the environment and of women and work to bring attention to the ways that women are oppressed by the increasing effects of climate change. 
According to the United Nations Environment Programme, environmental conditions impact the lives of women and men in different ways due to historically-established inequalities. Traditional gender roles create differences in the ways men and women act in relation to the environment and environmental change.
Gender gaps are a significant barrier to women’s freedom to make decisions and pursue opportunities, as well as to effective sustainable development and resource control and allocation. In many cases, they are at the mercy of a rapidly changing climate. Matcha Porn-In, a Thai human-rights organization, describes the gender-gap issue poignantly: “If you are invisible in everyday life, your needs will not be thought of, let alone addressed, in a crisis situation.”
While gender norms are slowly being redefined, this work isn’t necessarily progressing at the same rate around the world. In many developing countries, women have less opportunities for furthering their education and careers, instead assuming the traditional role of a family caretaker and mother. The UN Sustainable Development’s fifth goal seeks to eliminate forms of violence and discrimination against women, achieving gender equality and equal rights to economic resources and property ownership. While this goal is well-meaning and brings attention to a key aspect of development, it is also unspecific and lacking effective actions. 
Environmental crises themselves can compound pre-existing issues in society. Climate change impacts, such as crop failure, can cause far-reaching food insecurity, putting added stress on women to source enough food to feed their households. Fossil fuel shortages in areas that lack developed infrastructure may burden women, for whom collecting fuel and water to cook for their households is a daily task. As resources become more scarce, women who act as caretakers spend more of their time expending energy searching for what they need to support their families, effectively ensuring that there is no time for them to further their education, pursue their own goals or better their own lives. 
Natural disasters and resource conflict can uproot households and leave women more vulnerable to gender-based violence. Consequently, sustainability management programs created to address climate change issues must do a better job of taking local gender dynamics into account, creating safe spaces and rebuilding infrastructure with the dual goal of creating more sustainable habits as well as increased gender equality. 
One way of addressing the societal inequities that women face is the establishment of microfinance institutions. Traditional banks require collateral, assets and high credit scores to take out loans, which keeps much of the world’s poorest populations locked within a perpetual cycle of poverty. In recent years, an increasing number of microfinance institutions have been created for marginalized unbanked communities to promote self-sufficiency and income generation. Many microfinance organizations were created specifically for low-income women, providing low-interest microloans and financial literacy information to start their own businesses and provide personal empowerment and autonomy.
Additionally, women are historically underrepresented in seats of political power, making up less than 25% of national parliamentarians worldwide. As a result, in the governance and sustainable management spheres, women’s needs and priorities are often overlooked. Establishing patterns of progressive and inclusive decision making is essential for environmental conservation and also for the promotion of women’s rights as a whole. 
Jacinda Ardern, the recently reelected prime minister of New Zealand, has an ambitious agenda that includes both environmental and women’s rights issues, including net zero emissions by 2050, providing free menstrual products in all schools, approving paid leave for miscarriages and establishing a climate commission. One of the world’s youngest prime ministers, Finland’s Sanna Marin, is working towards economic, social and environmental sustainability:closing the pay gap between men and women, legislating stricter nationwide rape laws and attempting nationwide carbon neutrality by 2035.
Additionally, more countries around the world, including Finland, are beginning to provide free college education to university students. While this is the start of closing a financial and gender inequality gap in higher education, we need to consider how to adequately address gender biases and inclusivity in educational environments across the globe. Global female illiteracy rates are much higher than men, but every additional year of attending school provides lasting benefits. Going to school can help women earn higher wages and have better professional opportunities, as well as having fewer children and being less vulnerable to domestic violence. 
As we begin the arduous process of redesigning our societies for a more sustainable future, more gender-based issues can also be addressed via urban planning. Developers continue to expand and build in the hopes of creating a greener, more sustainable urban utopia. 
Designing sustainable and feminist cities are not mutually exclusive. Improving public transportation reduces the use of privately-owned cars, also benefiting women who may be pregnant or mothers who have to drop children off at daycare before heading off to work. 
Walkable streets encourage foot traffic and are more accessible for strollers and wheelchairs. Using renewable energy to create extended lighting systems will save energy as well as potentially reduce violent crimes against women at night. 
While these are merely a few examples of the intersection of environmentalism and feminism, I say all this with a caveat. Climate change affects groups around the world differently, but it most severely impacts marginalized communities, including women, Black and Indigenous people and people of color, low-income, those in rural, remote, or informal housing, those with disabilities and trans and gender-nonconforming individuals.
To dip briefly back into the theoretical realm, ecofeminism seeks to establish alliances across multiple sectors of struggle. To achieve real gender equality, we must reassess traditional gender roles and question our belief systems. We cannot effectively fight all aspects of climate change without addressing ensuing socio-economic issues and intersectional identities. Solutions need to recognize the individual ways that people around the globe are experiencing the changing climate, resource scarcity, increasing population density and pollution. 
Incorporating intersectional feminism into environmental governance, decisions, activism and change is just one of many ways that we can approach societal injustices head-on and design solutions for unique climate problems faced by women. 
At its root, climate change is both caused by and affects class struggles, poverty, racial discrimination and other forms of inequity. We must recognize this interconnectedness; fighting for climate justice cannot come without fighting against oppression and injustices on a larger scale. With greater conscientiousness, global leaders, institutions, NGOs and activists can simultaneously promote environmental protection and gender equality.

The 140th Undergraduate Student Government Senate introduced their final series of resolutions at the meeting Tuesday. 
The resolutions will be voted on next week, in addition to the inauguration of the incoming members of the Areias-Warren administration. President Gabriel Savage thanked everyone for their commitment and ability to face challenges in the Annual Presidential Report given at the end of each administration. 
“We got a whole lot of work done this year but the work of a good student government is never finished,” Savage said. “We learned about ourselves a lot as an organization: the good, the bad and the ugly, but we still have a lot more to learn. It was a hard year for all of us, and I don’t see any point in denying that. We are emerging from that year with not only hope, but as tonight’s agenda would tell you a concrete plan on how to proceed.”
He praised the accomplishments made by USG over the academic year, including a successful negotiation of a pass / no pass option for students and being able to persuade the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry. Savage also praised the members of USG for being able to work during times of adversity. 
“What’s really worth celebrating is that all of you here today, chose to prioritize service in a time of fear and uncertainty, chose to work and to fight for your fellow Trojans when you definitely had enough on your plate as it was,” he said. “You chose to serve not when it was convenient or when it was easy, but when the student body really needed it.”
After Savageʻs speech, the Transfer Student Assembly was approved to become an official assembly within the programming department. No senator raised any concern to debate on the subject. 
Sen. Jack Rasmussen introduced a piece of legislation he co-authored in support of new accommodations in campus dining halls, in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Created as a way to implement safety measures among students, faculty and staff as they plan to reconvene at the University dining halls, Rasmussen said that necessary accommodations, such as establishing a “Grab N’ Go” system and predesignated takeout options, were needed in order to ensure a smooth transition for those present on campus.
Sen. Cathy Ding also introduced a resolution to address mental health issues among USC students. The resolution would implement a product known as Kognito, which functions as an interactive online role-play simulation that informs users on the information regarding mental health and suicide prevention for students, staff, faculty and academic advisors.
Sen. Shreya Chanda also introduced a resolution at the end of the meeting, in support of acknowledging climate change and holding the University more accountable to addressing the issue. 
A series of Constitution and Bylaw Amendments were also passed. A number of these amendments were passed due to a restructuring proposal that would provide more jurisdiction to the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, streamline legislative processes to legislative committees, introduce new representative councils and make the funding department more efficient. 
One such amendment is Bylaw Amendment 2, which establishes an Advocacy Department within the legislative branch. The purpose behind the department would be to discuss campus climate issues that affect communities. 
At the end of the meeting, the senators reviewed the individuals nominated to certain appointed positions on the executive branch. Alexis Arieas and Lucy Warren announced Kros Day, a junior majoring in communication, for Chief Communications Officer, Adenike Makinde, a junior majoring in real estate development, for Chief Financial Officer, Jessica Kim, a junior majoring in environmental engineering, for Chief Programming Officer, Kavita Rai, a sophomore majoring in public policy, for Chief Diversity Officer and Max Gomez, a junior majoring in communication, for Chief of Staff. 
The nomination of Gomez, a current senator, was met with concern from Alyssa Delarosa, a junior majoring in psychology, who claimed that Gomez used his power and influence to cause students to vote for Areias and Warren during the 2020-21 election in violation of Elections Code IV.E.1, which directly states that support for candidates “must be individual and must not be affiliated with [a member’s] position in USG.”
“After he committed a blatant violation of honesty and integrity and abuse of his power and influence, as you all are aware, USG has lost the trust of the student body,” she said during the three minute discussion session. “Now, USG, through this confirmation, seems even more determined to sever the trust between students by committing this highly unethical confirmation.”
Arieas and Gomez, who were both present at the meeting, responded to Delarosa’s concern by recognizing and thanking her for sharing her comments. According to Areias, the decision to select Gomez for Chief of Staff came after a rigorous interview process. 
“The Elections Commission has reached their decision, and we have reflected their decision and acknowledged it,” Gomez said. “Outside of that, I just want to say, I don’t have any goals here in this organization besides serving students supporting this organization and using my skills as a student and leader to empower those on campus.” 
Despite their responses, Delarosa expressed her displeasure at their answers. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, she still expressed her claim that Gomez had committed a violation. 
“I merely expressed my concerns, and the concerns of the student body who’s aware of the situation and what’s going on,” Delarosa said. “I found [it] really odd that he was just really defensive and saying how he didn’t have this agenda [of affecting the election].”
The executive board nominations, as well as the academic yearʻs last Senate resolutions, will be decided on at next weekʻs meeting.
