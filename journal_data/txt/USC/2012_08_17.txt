For the high school overachiever who juggled five or six extracurriculars along with multiple AP and IB classes, coming to college can be a bit of an adjustment.
Hectic class schedules don’t always allow room for active membership in many organizations, and a difficult college course can leave students feeling depleted and unable to garner enthusiasm for anything outside of weekend partying.
But even for those who won’t be struggling with a demanding schedule, finding a niche in USC’s large but diverse community can take some time. Selecting a degree from 20 schools and more than 120 majors and minors in the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences alone already provides enough of a challenge, but with 750 student organizations thrown into the mix, the possibilities for involvement can be a bit daunting.
So here’s a guide to make the transition a little easier and help you plan your first semester at ’SC.
 
 
All-Star Athletes:
Whether you’re a wannabe Matt Barkley or just looking to get fit, USC athletics has a team to cater to your interests. In addition to possessing a variety of unique sports organizations like the Trojan Judo Club and USC Fencing, USC also has the ever-popular intramural sports leagues.
In addition to hosting a variety of sports such as Ultimate Frisbee, golf, volleyball and tennis, USC athletics further divides its intramural teams into separate leagues, including all-university, coed, womens and fraternity and sorority. The signup for intramural teams usually takes place at the beginning of every semester at the Lyon Center or on its website.
Another option for getting involved athletically is joining one of ’SC’s niche organizations. Harry Potter fans should take advantage of the Quidditch team, and beach-lovers eager to get off campus can sign up for the USC Surf Club or the SCuba Club.
With over 150 different athletic organizations, USC has plenty to offer students eager to stay in shape.
Publication Junkies:
Though the Daily Trojan, Neon Tommy and El Rodeo might immediately come to mind for students interested in creating stories and designing layout, USC has other organizations that involve chronicling and documenting college life.
POSE, USC’s student-run fashion magazine, offers writers, photographers and designers a chance to generate online and print content involving global style and trends in fashion, music and the arts with an on-campus twist. Described as “USC’s antidote to Fashion Fever,” POSE is published twice a semester and provides a hip and modern way to explore the college literary scene.
For those looking for a more intellectual outlet, SCribe, run by the Dornsife College, blends academia with the literary world and allows writers to submit politically and socially driven articles. Though most of the online magazine’s content comes from papers carefully crafted in Writing 340, students are welcome to submit their own high-quality creative and nonfiction pieces for evaluation and publication by a team of student editors.
If you’re interested in covering community news stories in South Central, check out  the online publication Intersections South LA. With a variety of journalistic mediums like video, photography and opinion-based articles, Intersections provides a variety of ways to explore the art of reporting.
After-Hours Virtuosos:
Even if you don’t have time to add vocal performance as a second major or pick up a minor in jazz studies, the Thornton School of Music is home to a variety of performance groups that meet a couple of times a week for jam sessions and concert rehearsals.
Singers should take a look at one of many a cappella groups, such as the award-winning SoCal Vocals, or opt to join a chorus like the University or Concert choirs. Instrumentalists can choose from several jazz ensembles or chamber orchestras, or can take private lessons with a university instructor. Most of the groups hold auditions during the first few weeks of every semester and hold multiple concerts throughout the academic year.
But the opportunities for involvement don’t just end with the many on-campus ensembles.
Many of the School of Dramatic Arts musical performances require orchestral talent, so paying attention to the call board and auditioning for a specific show is a great way to showcase your instrumental chops while underscoring some of USC’s stellar onstage talent.
Either way, there’s no reason for that instrument you lugged all the way to college to sit untouched in the corner of your dorm room.
Community Service Fanatics:
Though many sororities and fraternities organize their own volunteer events, USC has a few programs and organizations whose sole purpose is community service.
Taking an alternative winter or spring break trip is a great way to get involved in a global project without having to worry about a class schedule. In previous years, alternative break programs have focused on children’s issues, poverty and women’s empowerment in countries like Thailand, Guatemala and Honduras. If you’re not too eager to head home for the holidays, keep an eye posted on the Volunteer Center’s webpage to find out information on trips for this school year.
For those lacking wanderlust, the USC Helenes and Trojan Knights, “the official hostesses and hosts of USC,” provide volunteer opportunities for service on and off campus. As the two of the oldest service organizations on campus, the Helenes and Trojan Knights have worked with disabled youth in Los Angeles, assisted with Relay For Life and Swim With Mike and hosted President Barack Obama when he came to give a rally speech in 2011. Though the both have rigid eligibility requirements that may involve careful attention, they represent a diverse population of students all united by a common interest in community service.

If you spent too much time relaxing on the beach, or if you were stuck in an office with little -to-no exercise this summer, it’s time to work off the sluggishness of summer with a visit to the Lyon Center.
Fitness haven · The intramural sports, exercise classes and recreational facilities offered at the Lyon Center give students options for staying fit. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Lyon Center, University Park Campus’ recreation facility, will begin regular semester hours on Aug. 25. The center will kick off the school year with its annual open house, featuring recreational sports information sessions, intramural challenges and facility tours. Representatives from club sports will also be around to answer questions.
During the first two weeks of the semester, all fitness classes are free to students, staff and faculty that present an ID upon arrival to the facility. Take advantage of the opportunity: The Lyon Center has spent the summer preparing for the busy fall semester.
Among the new offerings in an already wide variety of fitness classes is the Les Mills Body Pump group fitness class, one hour of muscle strengthening through barbells and choreography. Another class, the Barre Blast, fuses the popular and ballet-inspired barre method with weights for toning and core work.
Also new for the fall semester is Stay Fit Panhellenic, a council offering group exercise classes on The Row as well as programming in student residence halls.
Favorite classes from previous years will also be returning. For the especially fit and determined, the Nike Training Club offers high-intensity interval workouts that work on muscle-strengthening, endurance and agility.
Not only does the Lyon Center offer fitness classes, it also offers some unique classes that help you better manage your day to day life. Among them is “Life Without a Car” which, as the name suggests, presents information and tips on how to navigate Southern California without a car.
Looking further ahead, there are plenty of exciting fitness-related events planned for non-students as well.
During Trojan Family Weekend, the Lyon Center will offer parents free access to the gym and group exercise classes. From Oct. 18-21, parents of USC students will get a glimpse into the numerous recreational facilities and activities available at the Lyon Center, among other events taking place during the weekend.
The following week will host the  Pac-12 Facebook Challenge, which  will feature an array of activities, including fitness challenges, introductory classes, a fun run and intramural sports. Participants will have the opportunity to log their challenge minutes on Facebook and to earn badges that they can post to their Facebook pages.  The objective of the tournament is to see which Pac-12 school can log the most minutes.
During the entire Pac-12 challenge, students, faculty and staff will have free access to the Lyon Center as well as the Health Sciences Campus Fitness Center — along with all group exercise classes  at both facilities.
The upcoming semester will prove to be an exciting and busy time for the Lyon Center with a range of activities for getting involved — from fitness classes to intramural sports. The aspiring fitness buff or athlete need not look any further than the Lyon Center, which offers classes that will satisfy a variety of interests, numerous sports options and a fitness challenge in mid-semester that will provide an opportunity for everyone to get engaged and excited. Even the workout-averse could find an enjoyable way to burn calories here.

There’s an abundance of reasons as to why thousands of high school seniors apply to USC every year: Ivy League-caliber academics, a sports program that could hold its own with any of the professional leagues and a sunny location that’s hard to beat.
But then there’s that other thing, something that might lie subconsciously in every Trojan’s decision: We’re pretty darn good looking.
And not just, “Eh, she’s cute for a Yalie” — which is an actual saying back East — but USC students can look like reincarnations of Greek gods: I’ve even met a student named Adonis.
Many Trojans work out every day. Girls wear make-up to class and dress themselves in the newest and hottest styles. They get their hair and nails done. Guys and girls even take time to look attractive when they’re going to the gym.
That being said, this is no average campus, and the dating scene at USC is complicated and confusing — but no doubt rewarding.
Toto, we’re not in high school anymore.
Once you accept that fact, life here can be a breeze. In high school, there were probably one or two cute kids whom everyone had crushes on.
Not so here.
USC is like the world’s best candy store: No matter if you like chocolate, vanilla or a little bit of both, you will find someone here who could be considered your ideal counterpart.
If a student chooses, they can be anonymous at this school. They can start their freshman year with a blank slate, able to reinvent and recreate themselves into the people that they were always meant to be.
But how do you start? How do you know which party to go to or how to act? How do you navigate these tumultuous waters known as the USC dating scene? After all, these first few weeks are very important: You start to make the friends you’ll be closest with for the rest of your life, and your reputation will begin to form.
By following these four tips, you’re sure to make an impression during your first few days as a USC college student.
Show Your True Colors
It’s hackneyed, yes, but it’s true: You shouldn’t have to pretend to be anything you’re not. At this point in our lives, we can smell B.S. from a mile away, and there’s nothing that’s a larger turnoff than someone being fake.
Think about it: Let’s say there’s a cute girl in your Spanish II class and you want to impress her, so you might let it slip that you were part of a band and have been playing guitar for eight years. Problem is, you don’t. For the next four years, you’re going to have to keep up the facade that you’re Kurt Cobain reincarnated. Lying is exhausting.
Even though our school is large, word travels quickly and it seems like everyone knows everyone. Don’t take a chance and fib something that you can’t get out of. The end result is just plain messy.
Just Say No
Yes, people are attractive. Yes, you may want to do things with your classmates that would be considered illegal in 1950. But, for the love of your reputation, don’t. There are plenty of people who are still remembered as the freshman-year hussies because they decided that the Welcome Back Foam Party was the place to hook up with five guys.
And it’s a well-known fact that older boys go to freshman events during Welcome Week just to pick up 18-year-old girls. It might sound exciting to receive advances from a 24-year-old grad student, but when you think about it you realize that this person is obviously not cool if he has nothing better to do than hang out with kids six years younger than him.
You have four years — keep everything in your pants for a couple weeks. If you must, next week The Row opens, and random hook-ups become more socially acceptable. Just wait.
Bye Bye Birdie
For those who come into college already in a long distance relationship, good luck with that. It’s always nice to have those first few naïve days, believing that it’ll somehow work when we all know that you’ll break up in a few months. It’ll start with missed Skype calls and mysterious drunk texts. Soon you’ll be crying on the phone to each other talking about an accident “that didn’t mean anything.”
As much as it might pain you, it’s much better to split up with your significant other on good terms now than to see it drag out in the mud later. If you’re truly meant to be together, you’ll get together when you’re older, wiser and living in the same city. College is a time of growth and learning, not a time of being chained down by someone you only see on FaceTime.
Get Out There!
The best recommendation I can give you is to go to the events that interest you most so that you can meet people that share said interests. Plenty of people here have friends in a multitude of majors, but there is always some sort of similarity that they share.
Reverting to idea number one, don’t try and push yourself in a direction that you don’t want to go in. Sure, college is the perfect place to try new things, but if you really hate the outdoors, don’t sign up for the outdoors club. No one wins if you’re miserable.
But if you’re the kind of kid that’s into Open Mic Night, then hit up the Ground Zero Performance Cafe. If you want to get involved in the LGBTQ scene, go to the LGBTQ and Ally Welcome Back Barbeque. Are you into film? Then check out all of the screenings the School of Cinematic Arts hosts almost every single night.
Everything will be awkward at first. Everything. But if you go to places where you actually want to be, then you’ll meet people who you can actually connect with.
College is a scary place, and times can get tough. All you need to know is that there are always Trojans here to help you out.
Seriously though, they’re in the bucket outside your RA’s room.
 
What about hot gays?  We have the hottest!
U are kidding me right?….

Eating in college, particularly if you’re holed up in a dorm, can be a tricky proposition.
Quick recipe · Getting creative when it comes to food can be handy in a college setting. This salmon-brussel sprout-and tomatillo dish is just one example of the many tasty creations a student can create in their dorm. – Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
 
Yes, the area around USC offers a surprisingly diverse menu from which to pick and choose, especially if you have a curiosity for ethnic, hole-in-the-wall joints. But eating out has a nasty habit of getting pricey. There’s nothing quite like staring down a bank statement in which you’ve, through some awful feat of gluttony, blown through your entire paycheck with a weekend’s worth of feasting.
Alternatives exist, no matter if you’re a freshman or a senior, lor living on or off campus. Even those with no access to a stove can make intriguing, tasty dishes with only a few spare dollars. Take the stereotypical college staple, ramen noodles — instead of microwaving another boring bowl, use the noodles as a blank slate for creative twists.
One take: Cook the noodles in water separately, then toss with a tangy vinaigrette or other dressing that’s been boosted with a little of the powdered ramen flavoring that comes in the package. Buy some grilled or fried chicken from the nearest supermarket and shred it, then toss into the noodles. Finally, add some frozen vegetables, quickly blitzed in the microwave till cooked through. It might sound strange, but this rough framework — swapping in different noodles, proteins and garnishes to your liking — makes for some delicious dishes on an enticingly low budget.
Options open up a bit more with access to a stove. Aim for dishes that taste great without requiring too many pans or too many steps. Pasta is a favorite exactly for its simplicity, but don’t settle for another jar of cheap, store-bought pasta sauce: Canned tomatoes (if possible, try Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes or San Marzano tomatoes from various specialty stores, including Trader Joe’s) quickly cooked with some basil and extra-virgin olive oil make for a superior option that freezes or refrigerates well.
That sauce, combined with some high-quality grated parmesan, chunks of fresh mozzarella or leftover vegetables and pasta, can make for a hearty, healthy pasta dish that rivals the stuff served in any Italian restaurant.
The most important cooking tip for college students, though, is to not be stubborn when it comes to recipes. Taking advantage of sales can lead to new flavor combinations but, more crucially, a smaller dent in your wallet: If eggplant is on sale, why not try that in a dish instead of squash? The same applies to simplifying recipes and leaving certain ingredients out: If a recipe calls  for two sprigs of thyme, there’s no point in buying a $5 pack of the herb and letting most of it die in the fridge. The potatoes will taste fine without it.
These philosophies apply even when you’re looking to impress some friends or a date. Even something elaborate-sounding —let’s say “pan-seared salmon with a tomatillo-jalapeno compote and butter-roasted brussels sprouts” — can be quite cost-effective. A portion only takes a few ingredients: a slab of salmon, a jalapeno, a tomatillo or two, a handful of brussels sprouts, maybe a stray chunk of onion, some salt and pepper and a knob of butter.
Chop the tomatillo, onion and jalapeno (to taste) into a very fine mince and add to a hot pan with a splash of extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and cook till the ingredients lightly brown and start to combine into a loose, jam-like texture. Scoop it out and wipe the pan out.
Then, heat the pan on high again with another splash of olive oil. Add the brussel sprouts, sliced lengthwise in half, cut-side down. Season with salt and pepper and check periodically until the sprouts begin to caramelize and char.
In the meantime, heat a second pan — preferably nonstick — with a bit of oil. Put the salmon, already seasoned with salt, skin-side down into the hot pan. When the skin crisps and browns, flip the salmon and turn off the flame. It will continue to cook as it rests.
Back to the sprouts: Add a splash of water and cover with a lid, a dish, some foil — or whatever else you may have — and steam for a minute or so. Then uncover, add the butter and roast on high heat until the edges are golden-brown and cooked through. A pinch of delivery-pizza red chili flakes can add some additional punch, if desired.
Now channel your inner Gordon Ramsay for plating: Mound the sprouts on the plate, then gently place the salmon on top. Place a delicate scoop of the tomatillo mixture on top and drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil around the plate.
Here’s a meal that would impress in a restaurant setting and run for four times the price. All you need are two pans, $5 and these five main ingredients. If that’s not the height of cooking in a college setting on a college budget, what is?

Los Angeles is one of the leading film capitals worldwide, so it is fitting that USC School of Cinematic Arts is one of the most highly ranked and prestigious film schools in the world.
Iconic professor · Drew Casper, a celebrity in the cinema school, gives an in-depth lecture on film in CTCS 190, an intro to cinema course. – Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
But SCA is not restricted to the George Lucases and Judd Apatows in the making. Between classes, screenings and special events, students have multifarious on-campus opportunities to explore the world of film.
Most importantly, these perks are available to cinema and non-cinema students alike, providing everyone with the chance to delve into one of the greatest cinematic resources in the nation.
For hardcore involvement, SCA classes are inherently meant for students who have a strong, academic interest in film. Many of the courses offered have the worthwhile professors or screenings to compensate for the 15-week time commitment.
The best part: Film electives are typically not exclusive to SCA students, so even the biology major with a passion for Hitchcock films can pursue his or her interest in the great film auteur.
Turns out Hitchcock enthusiasts are in luck — Film and/or Television Style Analysis (CTCS 469), taught by Professor Drew Casper, examines the great director’s individual style and will screen many of his classic films, including Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho.
To his credit, Casper — who holds a wealth of cinematic knowledge — steals the show with his passion for film and exuberant theatricality, which freshmen taking CTCS 190 will discover soon enough.
There’s also Theatrical Film Symposium (CTCS 466) taught by notable film critic Leonard Maltin. The course is one of the longest-running at USC and offers exclusive advanced screenings of highly anticipated films. Screenings include special guest speakers, including but not limited to directors, writers, actors, cinematographers and so forth. Alexander Payne and Jason Segel are just two of many to offer their input, so be sure to take the class in the fall when Oscar contenders will be screened.
But as mentioned before, classes are a big commitment, so students on an academic time crunch should check out SCA’s screenings and special events.
SCA advertises Outside the Box Office and the Alumni Screening Series, which are advanced screening series that show off a variety of works, ranging from independent to documentary to big-budget films. The former is a weekly showcase of upcoming films, while the latter shows off films from SCA alumni.
Though Outside the Box Office and the Alumni Screening Series appeal to a mélange of tastes and are open to all students, the two screening series seem to mostly be reaching the SCA community.
“There’s still the sense that this is a best kept secret on campus, even though the screenings are usually packed,” said SCA’s Director of Programming and Special Projects, Alessandro Ago.
With countless opportunities to view diverse upcoming films, there’s no reason why every student can’t partake in USC’s very own celebration of film. And the same goes for special events.
SCA often works with Visions and Voices to host speakers and put on festivals, events which are — you guessed it — open to everyone. Last November, SCA and Visions and Voices brought in eccentric Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar to discuss his work and career. And the year before, SCA, The Arab Film Festival and Visions and Voices put on a contemporary Middle Eastern film festival.
Though much of the upcoming fall calendar has yet to be confirmed, students can expect advanced film screenings, as always, and notable guest speakers such as Leslie Moonves, President and CEO of CBS Corporation and Ron Meyer, President and COO of NBC Universal Studios.
Additionally, SCA and Visions and Voices will celebrate “Nikkatsu at 100.” The three-day event will feature screenings and discussions with filmmakers, scholars and critics to honor the centennial of Nikkatsu, the highly esteemed Japanese film company.
The classes, screenings and events are all here for the taking, and SCA wants everyone to be involved.
“I really want the university at large to participate in [screenings and events] because it’s not just something that we do for the cinema school; it’s something that we do for the whole university,” Ago said.
And with so many available resources, there’s no reason why every USC student can’t celebrate their love of film.

USC is home to a number of talented musicians, all striving to share their talents with the world. On Thursday Aug. 23rd, USC’s own singer/songwriter Segun Oluwadele will do just that at the USC Visions and Voices kickoff in Bovard Auditorium.

Segun, a Texas native and junior in the Thornton School of Music’s pop music program, finds inspiration for his work from his own experiences and hopes to emphasize an element of compassion and soul that encourages the audience to learn something about themselves.
“I listen to [and] observe people and musicians for entertainment and content,” Segun said. “Then I channel that content into creativity.”
Segun came to Los Angeles with more than just dreams of higher education. For Segun, a self-taught guitarist and pianist, music is a passion, an outlet of personal expression that he hopes to share with the world.
With a humble beginning as a soloist in his elementary school’s variety show, Segun was hooked on music as early as the fourth grade.
“It was then [that] I realized how much I loved singing and being on stage,” Segun said. “From then on, music became a personal therapeutic hobby.”
By the time he was 12 years old, Segun had fully prepared to develop his passion for music and began writing his own songs. When he arrived at USC, he was ready to delve even deeper into his craft and discover his own distinctive sound and style.
“Being the artist you are inside is more important that trying to create an ‘artistic image,’” Segun said. “Being an individual is the only way to find out who you actually are.”
Chris Sampson, Segun’s songwriting professor and the associate dean of the Thornton School of Music, helped Segun harness a more distinct sound and meaning through the songs he creates.
“As a songwriter, Segun’s growth has come in his ability to make the lyrics and music work together to create a total emotional experience for the listener,” Sampson said.
Sampson also attests to the range of emotion in Segun’s performances.
“No matter the character of the song, he invests himself deeply into the lyrics,” Sampson said. “He has a stage presence that can fill any room.”
But after arriving at USC, Segun didn’t just channel all of his energies into his own music. The aspiring singer also joined USC’s SoCal VoCals a cappella group as a venture to grow in all aspects of performance, rising to the leadership role of music director for 2012.
“It has really broadened my perspective as a performer,” Segun said. “A cappella is such a different animal than what I normally do with my own music, and it [has] given me a few more tricks that I can use in my live shows now.”
In addition to the support he has gained at USC, Segun’s work has caught the attention of Grammy Award-winning artist Erykah Badu.
“It is always a pleasure to be a part of cultivating a true blossoming artist,” said Badu about sharing her artistic and industry experience with the growing singer.
Likewise, Segun had only positive things to say about his reputable mentor.
“Erykah has been a near and dear friend to our family,” Segun said. “When she saw that I was talented, she helped me book gigs and gave me advice about the industry.”
Badu has helped him reach a level of self-realization and commitment many artists only dream of. But the true impression Badu left upon Segun was unspoken.
“Her believing in me was the best advice in itself,” Segun said. “It showed how much I had inside and how I should never let anyone stray me from my destiny.”
Segun was overwhelmed with happiness when asked to perform in the SPARK! showcase and wants to share his gratitude with the audience for the support he has received at USC.
“I want people to listen closely to the messages written in between the lyrics,” Segun said.
With his onstage charisma and careful attention to detail in the crafting of his songs, Segun manages to consistently deliver emotional performances. In fact, it has been rumored that his performances have even made grown men cry — or at least his official bio claims.
As for Segun’s USC mentor, Sampson is proud of his student’s accomplishments and believes this showcase will provide an important platform for Segun to connect with a new audience.
“Segun has limitless potential, and I have a great deal of confidence that he will be a successful artist in the very near future,” Sampson said.
What’s clear is this: Segun’s upcoming performance in the SPARK! Kickoff is only a precursor to what’s in store for this young, up-and-coming artist.

In the last five years, Javon Johnson has been many things.
He serves as a professor at USC, holds a title as the USC Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative first post-doctoral fellow and is one of only two back to-back National Slam Poetry champions. But Johnson defines himself differently.
“Welcome, students” · When he’s not dazzling audiences with his spoken word, Javon Johnson teaches in the American Studies and Ethnicity Department at USC. “I’m a mentor to a lot of young people here,” Johnson said. “My door is always open to students at USC.” – Photo courtesy of Visions and Voices
“I’m a poet, an artist, a mentor, a performer — all of the above,” Johnson said. “I can connect with young people, I can relate to them and inspire them. I don’t look like the typical professor here, because it wasn’t too long ago that I was a student.”
Johnson is no stranger to the rigors of the academic world. After receiving his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in communication studies at Cal State Los Angeles, Johnson attended Northwestern University, where he completed a Ph.D in performance studies in 2010. He currently teaches at USC in the Department of American Studies and Ethnicity, where he has pioneered a course in African American studies.
As students will soon discover, however, Johnson is just as impressive outside the classroom.
As part of Visions and Voices, Johnson will take the stage on Thursday Aug. 23 at Bovard Auditorium and perform during the seventh-annual SPARK! kickoff, where students will get a sense of Johnson’s high performance energy and enlightening poetry.
Anyone who saw Johnson perform last year at SPARK! can recognize the range in Johnson’s writing — from political satire to dark comedy to achingly honest love — as a signature characteristic of his work. He frequently references pop culture icons like Michael Jackson or noted historical figures like Malcolm X. Still, Johnson makes sure he maintains a personal connection to his subject matter.
“[My poems are] either about somebody I admire or a topic that I’m passionate about,” said Johnson. “In that respect, I’m always writing love poems to life.”
But Johnson’s natural creativity comes out most in the vivid imagery employed in his poetry. Using phrases like “men with shrapnel for hands” to describe white supremacists of the 1960s or “wrinkles on her face like tattooed laughter” to illustrate his grandmother’s resilience set shim apart from his peers.
Still, just as Johnson bears a stylistic distinction from his spoken word contemporaries, he also has a unique story behind his interest in poetry. Though most poets cite specific authors or pieces of literature as the inspiration behind their own creations, Johnson’s literary ambitions were inspired by a different source — his high school crush.
“When I was in high school, a girl I was particularly attracted to came up to me and said, ‘I heard you were a poet,” Johnson said. “At the time, I hadn’t written a single line of poetry. But she said, ‘That’s totally hot and sexy that you write poetry.’ … That day, I went home and wrote my first poem and gave it to her. From then on, I was a poet.”
Eleven years later, after giving performances at nearly 100 college campuses across the nation,  Johnson is one of the most well-known slam poets in history. Described by his fans as having a “captivating energy,” Johnson has been commended for his ability to effortlessly combine social commentary, dark humor and emotion into a single piece of writing.
“I couldn’t not be a writer. I don’t know how not to be one,” Johnson said. “But I will tell you that my writing style has changed dramatically over the years. … I don’t feel a need to be boisterous — I appreciate subtlety.”
John attributes his transformation to years of life experience.
“I’ve definitely made mistakes,” said Johnson. “I probably shouldn’t say this on record, but I encourage my students to make mistakes. That’s how you learn.”
Johnson’s connection to USC runs far deeper than his year of teaching.
Born and raised in South Los Angeles, Johnson grew up just minutes away from campus and considers USC his home. Still, Johnson’s admiration for USC is not based on its locale but on something innate about its students.
“There’s something different about the Trojan Family. … There’s never been an energy even close to what I feel here,” Johnson said. “There’s a creativity and a commitment to doing something. Everybody’s doing something, and that’s incredibly inspiring.”
As Johnson prepares for his Visions and Voices performance, his message to his students is simple.
“Relax. Practice, practice, practice and perform. Listen more than you talk, write more than you perform and fight on.”

One won’t have difficulty finding one-stop shopping in Los Angeles. USC students, though, have an especially easy time. They need look no further than the USC Bookstore.
Muscle tee · Bookstore employee Noble Lau, a junior majoring in business administration, tries on the new Marvel T-shirt. By putting popular characters on USC garb, the bookstore has found new ways to market ’SC spirit. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
And no time is busier for the USC Bookstore than now, as the back-to-school rush and football season excitement collide.
Accordingly, the USC Bookstore administration has spent the past six months preparing fall product for the towering University Park Campus location.
“Really, our season goes August-September, December-January,” said Daniel Archer, president of USC Bookstores.
New for this peak season are ’SC logo-tees with Marvel Comics superheroes and seemingly conservative sport coats lined in cardinal-colored mesh material, with two gold USC logos embroidered inside.
New clothing has also come in from perennial favorites Nike, Russell and Under Armour, whose design teams approach Bookstore administration with new designs each season.
“We are trying to keep the floor fresh.” Archer said. “When game day comes, you’ve got 90,000 people hanging around this campus. A lot of them come every single year. And if the store’s stale, they won’t buy.”
On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Gregg Hiller, a senior majoring in English, admired the new Nike gear — specifically a white Nike Dri-Fit tee with red lettering.
“I’d rather have more of a contemporary design,” Hiller said, approving of the tee’s graphic quality.
Across the sales floor, equally unique products are being added to the home goods and accessories sections — you didn’t know you wanted a USC-engraved wooden cheeseboard until now. Nor did you think you could bring some Trojan shaped red-and-yellow pasta back to the dorm.
One wonders what the bookstore administration doesn’t emblazon with the school logo. Though Archer — out of respect to the many pitches he receives each week — won’t specifically say, he assures the bookstore has high standards for their merchandise.
“There are a lot more products that get rejected than get accepted,” Archer said.
In stark contrast, though, there’s nary a logo in sight on the basement floor.
This is where one can purchase Ray-Ban wayfarers or skin products from Khiel’s.
The ever-changing selection of homeware currently includes faux-vintage picture frames and sturdy, decorative glassware — “touches,” essentially, for the new apartment or dorm room.
The clothing down here is of particular focus among the bookstore administration. Student interest groups and web surveys have indicated higher demand for non-logo apparel, like denim, with affordability in mind.
“I know they wanted more jeans,” Archer said. “[Also] they wanted the price-point of the jeans to be lowered.”
And though the Hudson brand denim available in the store runs upwards of $100, the contemporary brands carried — from Splendid to Brixton — run the price gamut.
But it always comes back to those SC tees. “Attitude” ones like the popular “50-0” tee referencing last fall’s shut-out football game against UCLA still appeals most to buyers.
“Attitude” tees are the unofficial uniform of USC football fans, and the 32 registers during game day, according to Archer, average an astonishing $1,000 a minute.
Prospective student Elaine Wang, visiting from Taiwan with her alumni parents, also enjoyed the tees. She settled, though, on a “creative” red crewneck with ever-popular ’SC wordplay: “Stay in SChool.”
There are also books at the bookstore, of course, including an especially comprehensive cookbook section as well as a faculty authors section.
And after years of ardent demand from students to get the best possible pricing on text books, a book rental program is debuting this fall.
But, in general, college stores nationwide are trending away from the sale of books — it’s not where the money’s at.
“To call it a bookstore doesn’t really make sense anymore,” Archer said.
Perhaps next up at the bookstore is a name change?
Suggestions are welcome. But, no, SChool Store won’t work.

If you’re a freshman, three months ago you were probably cooling your heels and fanning yourself with your USC acceptance letter as you settled into a relaxing, stress-free summer.
But for some, that confidence will fade just moments after arriving on campus for Welcome Week. With self-assured upperclassmen unanimously pumping the “Fight on!” sign in the air every few seconds and grinning students wearing the same ‘SC gear, it’s easy to lose your identity for a few weeks — and adapting your high school persona to a college environment might feel impossible.
Still, in all this confusion, it’s important to remember that you don’t have to have everything figured out in the next few days.
Take USC for example. Even after 132 years, this school is still defining itself, constantly seeking new ways to grow and develop. In 2011, USC accepted generous donations from the Dornsife and Price families, changing the foundation of two of its major colleges: the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
This year, USC has updated several classrooms with new technology in order to remain at the forefront of undergraduate education. And looking ahead to the future, USC has unveiled a 20-year plan to expand student housing and generate a more “college-town” feel.
With all these changes and innovations, there is no single way to describe what USC is and what it will become. In short, USC has no one definition.
So keep that in mind as you select a major and figure out what student organizations to participate in. Even if you were a theater geek in high school, don’t be afraid to branch out and take that chemistry class that caught your eye. If you’ve never been on a sports team but always wanted to try your hand at archery or horseback riding, don’t hesitate to sign up for one of USC’s unique athletic clubs. If you’ve got a notebook full of unshared poetry, do something daring and take the stage on open mic night at the Ground Zero Performance Cafe.
As you begin to settle into freshman year, you will realize that there is no single brand of Trojan. In fact, USC thrives on the fact that there is no set definition for a USC student.
Just look at this year’s round of Olympic champions. At the 2012 London games, USC alumni won 25 medals — 12 of which were gold — but these winners weren’t just athletes during their time at USC.
Water polo player Kami Craig finished her second appearance at the Olympics but enjoyed surfing and studying sociology during her undergraduate years.
April Ross took home a silver medal in volleyball, but she also developed a love of photography and dance when she studied international relations at USC.
Before graduating in 2010, water polo champion Tumua Anae ruled the pool but majored in broadcast journalism and had a passion for literature.
Though these alumni certainly had a love for sports, they managed to take the time to explore and develop other skills. As you seek to define yourself and your experience at USC, follow what interests you — whether that means changing your major, joining a fraternity or sorority or curling up with a book from Doheny Library on a Thursday night instead of hitting Greek Row.
In the upcoming semester, USC will certainly give you plenty of opportunities for self-exploration. You might find yourself screaming at the top of your lungs with thousands of Trojan fans at the first game of the season and learning a little more about football. Attending a multitude of the 2012-13 Visions & Voices or School of Cinematic Arts Community events might help you develop a taste for the arts. Even talking with friends at the redesigned EVK Restaurant and Grill or Café 84 could help you gain respect for different perspectives and begin to transform some of your own viewpoints.
As you enjoy the way USC has redefined itself for this new school year, don’t be afraid to change who you are as well.
Let this year be about you.

In Paris, one dresses in solids and ascots to look chic. In Tokyo, one dresses in a multitude of colors and tutus to look quirky. In New York, one dresses up to create the illusion of having money. In Los Angeles? Well, this is a city filled with millionaires who attempt to look as poor — and therefore as hip — as possible.
After all, it’s become passé to show off your money — that’s what Orange County is for. Instead, Angelenos have put their energy into weeding through myriad clothing piles found in the city’s most popular vintage stores.
Los Angeles has made vintage shopping cool again. Though it might be sophisticated of you to answer “Valentino” when someone asks where you purchased a dress, nothing is more hip and happening then answering with, “a vintage store on Melrose.”
La Brea and Melrose avenues are flooded with such shops. If you have the desire to bring vintage into the 21st century, hit up these two streets for a day of store hopping.
But be careful — vintage doesn’t always mean cheap. For wallet-friendly finds, hit up the Good Will on Figueroa Street. If you’re willing to sacrifice a few bucks for fashion, then check out the list below.
 
DECADES TWO 
8214 Melrose Ave.
After getting buzzed in through the locked door and ignored by the staff, it starts to become clear that you shouldn’t enter Decades Two on Melrose unless you want a vintage dress to wear on the red carpet.
Not too long ago, “vintage” meant quality attached to a reasonable price. Apparently, Decades Two didn’t get the memo.
On one visit, the store was empty save for a film crew, the rapper Wiz Khalifa and his fiancée Amber Rose. Safe to say, it’s easy to feel incredibly out of place.
Decades Two was everything that good vintage shopping shouldn’t be. Vintage shopping is all about accessibility, warmth and the ability to see the magic in something decades old. Decades Two has transformed that magic into an absolutely robotic experience — rude staff and all.
 
JET RAG 
825 N. La Brea Ave
Jet Rag on La Brea is a rare gem of a store: Though you have to do a whole lot of sifting and sorting, you’re bound to find something you’ll fall in love with.
Once you acclimate to the lack of air conditioning, you can’t help but be excited about the options that the store provides. The store is filled to the brim with clothes, shoes and accessories. It seems as if “space” is a word unknown to the owners.
A plus, however, is that Jet Rag is very well organized. A whole rack of jean shorts sits cleanly and neatly across from the old grandpa sweaters that will sell out during Ugly Christmas Sweater Party season. And for the curvier girls — Jet Rag has a great plus-size section.
If you’re afraid of frills and ruffles, then Jet Rag might not be the place for you. Dresses straight out of The Wedding Planner take up lots of space, but if you can weed your way through them, then you’re bound to find something special.
 
AMERICAN RAG CIE 
160 S. La Brea Ave
A mixture of vintage and up-to-date fashion finds, American Rag CIE features clothes, furniture, shoes and DVDs. Part Urban Outfitters, part upscale boutique and part thrift store, it’s almost impossible not to find at least one thing to buy.
The front half of the store is devoted to the latest designer duds. T by Alexander Wang, Balmain and more take up a lot of the girl’s side. For those who are not looking to spend $4,000 on jeans, head to the back, where the vintage is amply stocked.
Beautiful ’50s- and ’60s -era bathing suits might be a bit overpriced, but when you notice the craftsmanship and originality of a sexy one-piece, it ends up looking like a steal.
A negative? American Rag only allows two garments per dressing room. So if you’re looking to revamp your wardrobe, it’s going to take a while.
 
THE WAY WE WORE 
334 S. La Brea Ave
Even though The Way We Wore features a fun collection of shoes and scarves, the theme of the store is certainly evening wear — and expensive evening wear at that.
Most of the dresses are in the $500 and up range, with many price tags reading more than $1,000.
Black slinky dresses from the ’70s are bound to dress up any occasion, if you can find a college event at which to wear one.
Yes, the prices can get a little ridiculous, but it’s hard not to look like a movie star in any of these glamorous finds.
Your website is very informative. I like your selections. I love to shop online it is my favorite thing to do in spare time. I bookmarked your site will share with friends and family.

Church and State is a Downtown restaurant — a dimly lit bistro within an old National Biscuit Factory building so far on the outskirts of the city it’s practically in Alameda, or maybe Boyle Heights.
If there’s any sign of a surrounding neighborhood, it’s certainly not visible by the dark of dinnertime. The restaurant is a pain to get to, even by so-is-everywhere-else-in-L.A. standards. And a meal at Church and State is certainly not conducive to maintaining a college budget.
You’d be crazy not to go.
The mussels are outrageously good with long stems of herbs remaining in the broth. The flatbread-like tartes are, by turns, chewy, gooey, crispy and crumbly. The cocktails are among the best I’ve had in the city, and I’ve had a lot of cocktails in this city.
You’ll hear these recommendations often during your time at USC, and certainly not just about Church and State.
There’s an assortment of good food in Los Angeles, of cheap eats and fine-dining empires. This is the city of Suzanne Goin and Nancy Silverton (look them up if you must).
This is also the city of In-N-Out and Winchell’s Donuts. All are worthy of praise. All are favorites among food-obsessed friends.
You may also seek out recommendations on your own. There are Yelpers and Chowhounds, Eaters and Serious Eaters.
The professional food coverage here is impressive but head-spinning. A few examples: the Pulitzer Prize-winning star Jonathan Gold at the Los Angeles Times, the exhaustive blogging at L.A. Weekly’s Squid Ink, which recommends multiple bests for every obscure foreign dish you’ve never heard of and soon won’t be able to avoid, the Grub Street blog that recently posted a slideshow of the 40 — 40! — best tacos in Los Angeles.
Overwhelmed yet? Los Angeles is a sprawling and international city, and the dining scene can appear a jungle.
The key is to set goals. Make them accomplishable. In the quest to best enjoy L.A. dining you are accountable only to yourself.
Running lists that include the not-to-be-missed seafood place your parents’ friends insist you visit and the breakfast truck with the city’s best chilaquiles are not lists you’ll follow. And most of all, these are lists bound to disappoint. Only you know how to expand and satiate your tastes.
Do some quick research. As the best chefs will tell you, a little bit goes a long way. Find the food writers that you respect most, the regional cooking you most long to try, the prices you can swing. Whittle your options down with those criteria and you’ll have a manageable, exciting list of restaurants to try. If you’re told not to miss Church and State but balk at the prices and gag at the thought of French-style pots of terrine, ignore that recommendation, no matter how diligent the recommender might be.
Keeping up with the culinary joneses can quickly take the joy out of eating. Don’t sweat the pop-up restaurant you missed in Venice — another one will quickly take its place or reappear in Silver Lake. You might hear praise for the shrimp toasts at Son of a Gun by numerous people and publications. But if you convince yourself you enjoy shrimp toasts more than you would the restaurant’s less-touted fried chicken sandwich, you’ll have cheated yourself out of a potentially great dining experience at an undeniably great restaurant.
And remember, just because you haven’t read about something, doesn’t mean it’s not worthy. Food coverage is expansive in this city, but places still get overlooked. Only now that star chef Josef Centeno has left Lazy Ox Canteen is the nearby Spice Table getting the recognition it should have received when opening last year.
Trust your instinct and find your own hot spots. It’s the rare day that Santa Monica’s Cha Cha Chicken gets a shout-out from a major food overage outlet, but it’s something of an abomination to drive by that vibrantly colored shack without picking up plantains and jerk chicken.
In Los Angeles, there’s the constant, increasing sense that you could always be eating something better. Think of it as optimism. An eternally optimistic passion of the greatest kind.

Located in the concrete jungle of Downtown, USC does not boast an optimal vantage point when it comes to scoping out Southern California’s many beaches.
But a drive down the Pacific Coast Highway, past the rows and rows of buildings and cement-paved streets, will reveal the legendary sun, sand and surf for which the Golden State is most known.
For those looking for a traditional beach environment, Santa Monica provides enough activity for a weekend getaway. There’s the expansive beach, where locals and tourists alike can swim, surf and play volleyball to their hearts’ content. There’s also the Santa Monica Pier, complete with its own amusement park and promenade, as well as shops and restaurants galore.
The Pier plays host to a number of events throughout the year, including the annual Twilight Concert series, which takes place every Thursday from now until Aug. 30. Parking, unsurprisingly, can be difficult, especially on the weekends. If the parking lot adjacent to the beach is already full, try the Promenade parking structure instead.
If the thought of a family-friendly beach scene seems unpleasant, there is Venice Beach, Santa Monica’s more eccentric neighbor. From Harry Perry, the famous electric guitar-playing man on roller blades, to the brawny men and women pumping iron at the Muscle Beach Gym, there is much to see in Venice Beach. Much of the activity revolves around the Ocean Board Walk, home to a bread pudding stand featured on Food Network, makeshift tables selling jewelry and other wares as well as a charming hodgepodge of street acts. Do keep in mind, however, that Venice Beach is not as safe at night as it is in the daytime, so plan accordingly.
Taking its name from the metropolitan city in New York, Manhattan Beach provides for a more glamorous beach trip. With its seaside restaurants- — along whats known as “The Strand” –— and picturesque pier, the classic day at the beach suddenly takes on a different definition. Though Manhattan Beach encompasses all that beaches have come to represent — salty sea breezes, the crashing of waves, people young and old strolling about — there is a tinge of irony associated with this beach: Be wary of the boundaries, as swimming is prohibited in a good number of areas around the beach.
Not too far from Manhattan Beach is Redondo Beach, easily another must-see beach in Los Angeles. Redondo Beach boasts a smaller and quieter beach town, which residents and visitors as well as television and movie producers have come to love. This star-studded beach was once home to the lifeguard drama Baywatch. But even when no filming is going on, there is no shortage of surfing, volleyball or waves. And as soon as night approaches, the shops and restaurants that dot the boardwalk light up to create a kind of neon wonderland on the beach.
Nevertheless, sometimes the best beaches are not very showy at all. Cabrillo Beach, located near San Pedro, is homey and peaceful and makes for relaxing strolls or pleasant “daycations” with friends and family. Wind surfing lessons are offered for those with a sense of adventure. There is also an aquarium nearby for those interested in interacting with and learning about the marine environment.
But perhaps this sounds all too traditional. For a more hipster-friendly beach, Hermosa Beach could not fit the part better. As a hot spot for beach volleyball and beach parties, Hermosa Beach attracts a young and lively crowd. Whether sorting through vintage clothes at Pier Plaza or laying out on the warm sand, this beach is not too far from paradise.
For a beach that is nothing but Californian, look no further than Malibu. With surfers at every turn, it is not hard to believe the stereotype that all Southern Californians can surf is accurate. And while at Malibu, do not forget to stay for the sunset. As the sun approaches the horizon, the sky turns a deep, fiery orange as the sound of waves ebbing and flowing on the sand create a soundtrack of sorts to accompany this breathtaking sight.
Of course, no beach list is complete without the quintessential beach on which to take long, romantic walks. In this case, seek out El Matador Beach. Known for its cool breezes, clear waters, numerous tide pools and mystifying caves, El Matador is truly the perfect and romantic getaway destination.
From people-watching in Venice to catching the sunset in Malibu, each beach has its own personality to offer those eager to stick their toes in the sand. So when in Southern California, do as the Southern Californians do: Go to the beach.

With all the worn-out frozen yogurt shops and fast-food restaurants crowding the Figueroa corridor, it’s easy to give up all hope of finding a satisfying, home-cooked meal near campus.
Cozy atmosphere · Members of the USC community relax and take a study break over pancakes at Jacks N Joe. Owners Mark and Vianney Bednorz often come by to chat with students about their studies and future plans. – Chris Sanchez | Daily Trojan
But just ask any student where to find the best breakfast near USC and he or she will probably point you about nine blocks north of campus, where USC alumnus Mark Bednorz and his wife Vianney Bednorz greet hungry customers with charming smiles and plates of steaming pancakes at the comfortable but modern Jacks N Joe, located just above West Adams Boulevard.
Vianney Bednorz laughed as she recalled her friends’ reactions when she and Mark Bednorz opened the restaurant in December of 2010.
“People thought we were crazy when we wanted to put a restaurant in L.A.,” Vianney Bednorz said. “And maybe part of it is being a little bit crazy.”
But for the Bednorz family, the diverse Figueroa neighborhood was appealing.
“You get the students, we’re sandwiched in between three police departments so we get a lot of law enforcement, and then you have the community,” Vianney Bednorz said. “It’s such a random mix of people.”
On any weekend morning, a crowd of USC students, community members and tourists clamber outside the storefront, hungrily considering the laminated white menus as they await their chance to taste cinnamon apple pancakes or omelettes with Portuguese sausage, spam and feta.
But Jacks N Joe doesn’t just draw attention because of its food. The entire place has a family-oriented vibe that makes homesick students consider the restaurant a home away from home.
“[Jacks N Joe] is about more than just food,” Mark Bednorz said. “It has less to do with food and more about life. And enjoying life. And really bringing [students] to [their] potential. We sit here and talk to everybody and encourage you and tell you ‘Yeah! That’s great. Do this and that.’ And maybe we’re living proof that you can enjoy your life and do something great.”
Still, despite Mark Bednorz’s pleasure with the Jacks N Joe’s success, this restaurant for the USC community almost happened by chance.
After finishing his undergraduate degree in architecture and enjoying his time in the USC Surf Club, Mark Bednorz went on to work as an architect. Several years later, his son, Julian, who also graduated from USC with a degree in architecture, inspired him to give up his day job and open up a restaurant.
When Julian Bednorz came home with a group project to design a building near campus, Vianney and Mark Bednorz pitched the idea for “a breakfast all day kind of place” that would offset the unappealing fast food joints located near the campus. A few months later, while on a family vacation to the Grand Canyon, the Bednorz family decided to turn the school project into a reality.
“It was never a dream to open a restaurant,” Vianney Bednorz said. “We [were] all just sitting there on the cliff of the Grand Canyon and we [said], ‘Well, why don’t we just do something totally different with our lives? Why don’t we open a restaurant?’”
After getting back from the trip at the end of May 2010, Mark and Vianney Bednorz immediately began to work on the blueprints for the building and secured a lease by mid-July. Using Mark Bednorz’s expertise in design and architecture, the couple oversaw construction in August and finally had the completed building by December — a quick turnaround for opening a restaurant.
“We did all of the design, all of the construction, all of the drawings. Everything was submitted by myself to the city,” Mark Bednorz said. “[Knowing architecture] really paved the way for me to open up a restaurant, because that’s usually the hardest.”
After helping her husband put the finishing touches on the building’s design, Vianney Bednorz went to work on personally crafting the eccentric menu. Fans of Jacks N Joe will recognize meals like the “WTF?,” which features oddly-shaped pancakes topped with sweetened cream cheese, strawberries, powdered sugar and blueberries.
Other favorites include the “Pudgy Elvis,” a banana-and-peanut butter pancake dish named after the Bednorz’s dog, and the “7 Minutes in Heaven French Toast” with nutella, bananas and strawberries.
“Everything’s very personal,” Vianney Bednorz said. “Our menu is based on our family. Our ‘Roo’s Favorite,’ that was my daughter who passed away. She would eat nothing but chocolate chip pancakes. That’s all she would ever order, so those are a tribute to her.”
But even outside the menu and the general atmosphere of the restaurant, family remains a cornerstone of Jacks N Joe.
When they’re not dabbling in philanthropy by donating money to Troy Camp or talking to USC’s sororities and fraternities about fundraisers for children in Guatemala, Mark and Vianney  Bednorz can be seen in the kitchen, preparing a fresh creation for the “Pancake of the Month.” Even the duo’s daughter, Isabella, often mans the cash register or buses tables while several of the family’s friends move swiftly through the restaurant, delivering food to tables and working in the kitchen.
“We tend not to just hire off the street,” said Vianney Bednorz. “We love to hire people that know people who know people. It has that kind of feel, and we like to keep it like that. We’re not just coworkers. We’re like a family here.”
Mark Bednorz’s parting advice to students interested in running their own business: Take a risk. “Just go for it,” Mark Bednorz said. “I wish more people would just dive off the end and care less about what people think. Just say ‘Hey, this is me. This is what I want to do.’ I just think, ‘Acquire less and do more.’ That’s what we have to do in life. It works for us and we enjoy it.”

Thank you Carrie and the Daily Trojan.

After the last decade of blockbuster filmmaking, it’s easy to forget that superheroes weren’t always part of the mainstream. Most people know the names and basic origin stories of popular superhero characters, and for obvious reasons.
“Superheroes are, in a sense, all of society’s modern mythology,” said William Ford-Conway, co-president of USC’s comic book club. “Even if you don’t read the source material, everyone identifies Batman, Superman and Spider-Man.”
Even so, how many people can say they’ve ever picked up a comic book?
From the first appearance of Superman in 1939 until the end of the last millennium, comic book icons held a particular niche status. The number has fluctuated as the popularity of comics has waxed and waned throughout the decades, but traditionally the most dedicated fans of superheroes —the ones willing to spend the time and money to follow their printed adventures every month — have never had the sheer numbers for comic books to influence our culture as much as other media.
It’s no surprise, then, that most people’s familiarity with these characters comes from onscreen adaptations of their printed origins. Television shows like the Adam West Batman of the ’60s or the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk of the ’70s and ’80s certainly made their mark, but as is usually the case, it’s film that has the greatest opportunity to impact our culture. For a long time, nothing illustrated the box office potential of superheroes as spectacularly as the Richard Donner Superman films and Tim Burton’s take on Batman.
But this excitement has never been permanent. As the quality of the Superman and Batman film franchises deteriorated, the hype surrounding the characters simmered down to a general awareness buoyed by the enthusiasm of the ever-present comic fans.
“Comic books, graphic novels and superheroes are not only a part of our entertainment, but of our lives,” Ford-Conway said.
For more than 60 years, such passionate attachment to Marvel, DC and the like was hardly a popular sentiment.
Then, in 2000, everything changed with the release of X-Men, the first big-budget film based on a property unmistakably from the world of Marvel Comics. Thanks to believable CGI and a talented cast, Bryan Singer’s film and its 2003 sequel, X2, coupled with the concurrent success of Sam Raimi’s Spiderman films, set a precedent that Hollywood couldn’t help but notice: Superheroes sell, more than ever before.
Follwing Singer’s and Raimi’s example, a tidal wave of origin stories hit theaters. And though the likes of Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider did nothing to endear audiences to the comic book movie trend, the successes drew far more attention than the failures.
But the true responsibility for solidifying the recently renewed strength of this new superhero culture can be traced to the visions of two men.
The first is Christopher Nolan, whose Dark Knight trilogy took the world’s most popular superhero and rooted him in a thrillingly realistic environment, allowing for a dark and modern vision of the story that — thanks to Heath Ledger’s Joker — will go down as perhaps the definitive take on the Batman mythos. Nolan won true mainstream appeal for mastering a strategy that USC screenwriting student Robert Browning thinks welcomes a wider audience: “Minimizing what most people would consider to be the fantastic or nerdy side of superheroes,” making the idea of a man dressing up to fight crime believable to everyone.
But when it comes to the most recent superhero blockbusters, Nolan is only one side of the coin. The other is Kevin Feige. Feige spearheaded Marvel Studios’ effort to create an interconnected cinematic universe, the first phase of which culminated this summer with Joss Whedon’s The Avengers, a purely fun blockbuster effort so monumental in ambition that it earned its own temporary exhibit on campus at the School of Cinematic Arts. Tour guide Preston Walker identified this as the source of the purest sense of excitement not only from prospective students and adults, who are “truly awestruck” at the props as they “recognize childhood heroes-turned movie stars,” but also younger children who act like “the place just became Disneyland.” As more grow up in a culture where superhero love is the norm, it’s really not surprising that costumes and concept art can rival USC’s athletics in generating visitor interest. After all, no one told these kids that superheroes didn’t used to be popular.
But with The Avengers setting box office records and Dark Knight Rises completing Nolan’s celebrated trilogy, it’s fair to say superhero obsession has reached its zenith. Now, not only is everyone aware of these comic characters, but most people are fans of them as well —- -and with an unprecedented level of familiarity. Even five years ago, how much of the American public knew anything about Iron Man, Thor or Hawkeye? Now these are household names, cultural icons whose imagery people wear without a second thought as to their social standings. Comic books are cool now. In fact, the last decade or so has seen the whole of nerd culture hit the mainstream, the rise of superhero films being the chief cause.
Reading comic books no longer carries any negative stigma; if anything, it indicates that one is more in-the-know about our cultural landscape simply because — thanks to the clear profits already won by trusting the genre — Hollywood has adopted the mentality that today’s comics are tomorrow’s tentpole summer movies and serialized TV shows.
Readers who might have been thought of as basement-dwelling pariahs 20 or 30 years ago are now the furthest thing from that. They’re ahead of the curve, and more want to join them every day.
And the die-hard fans couldn’t be more pleased.
“It’s great to see our heroes, our legends and our mythology branch out to the masses,” Ford-Conway said.
It’s an assimilation of comic books into the mainstream so universal, so tangible and so game–changing on every level of our media that it’s created a new cultural era.
This is the age of the superhero.
[…] Superheroes resurge with popular movie franchises Television shows like the Adam West Batman of the '60s or the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk of the '70s and '80s certainly made their mark, but as is usually the case, it's film that has the greatest opportunity to impact our culture.

Locale, locale, locale. In addition to flaunting successful alumni and numerous research opportunities, USC advertises a campus “located in the heart of Los Angeles” as a clear incentive to attend one of the most expensive private universities in the country.
With Hollywood, Downtown and boroughs like Chinatown and the Fashion District beckoning, many freshmen are more excited about getting off campus than attending their first classes. But as several students soon discover, attending college in one of the most iconic cities in the world doesn’t necessarily mean that one has the means to explore it.
Students fortunate enough to own cars often find themselves trapped in the relentless L.A. traffic, and even renting a Zipcar can push back plans to visit Venice Beach if there are no cars available on the designated getaway weekend. Nevertheless, for 2012, students can find a host of options — new and old — for learning Los Angeles as well as their studies.
For those who don’t mind a 30-minute bike ride or $15 cab fare, a trip to LA Live is a great way to escape campus for a few hours. With the Staples Center, Regal Cinemas and restaurants such as Yardhouse or The Farm of Beverly Hills dotting the area, an evening date or night out with friends becomes simple and well within reach. For those tired of LA Live, heading a few extra blocks north toward Seventh Street puts students at South Flower Street, where stores such as Victoria’s Secret, Express and Bath and Body Works provide comfortable shopping at Macy’s Plaza.
Getting to LA Live without a bike or money for a cab, however, provides a bit more of a challenge. Fortunately, a new development in public transportation has provided a cost-efficient and timely method of getting off campus outside of shuttle hours.
With the partial completion of the Expo rail line on June 20, the Metro has taken a major step toward remedying the major lack of public transportation in a city that rivals the subway-accessible New York City in terms of popularity. Students now have the option of boarding the train at Expo Park-USC, Jefferson-USC and Expo-Vermont by paying $5 for a day pass or $1.50 at each boarding to ride as far west as Culver City, which boasts a moderate array of small shops, as well as museums and art galleries.
Heading east on the rail puts students at the urban Wilshire District, where Koreatown, the Wiltern Theatre Concert Hall and the delectable Farmers Market attract Angelenos familiar with the area, as well as tourists eager to get outside Downtown. Though this area has been accessible by rail for quite some time, the Expo Line connects East L.A. with USC, saving students a bus trip to the Red Line entrance at Seventh Street and providing access to popular points, such as the Fashion District, Grand Park and Union Station, where students can catch a train to Anaheim for a day trip to Disneyland and California Adventure.
Phase 2 of the Expo Rail has not fully reached completion, so students looking to journey directly to Santa Monica, Beverly Hills or Westwood will have to find another mode of transportation. Metro, however, has set plans to complete a full route to the coast by 2015.
While Metro polishes up its plans for more expansive travel, renting a Zipcar is an ideal option for escaping to Santa Monica Pier or Venice Beach for a few hours. With a discounted USC membership of $25, students can easily plan a day trip and escape from Trousdale for a few hours — provided they reserve a car far enough in advance. Gas and insurance are automatically included in membership fees, and since the cars are parked and ready to go, there is very little hassle regarding pickup on the day of the trip.
The one downside? The company only offers a moderate selection of cars, so traveling with a large group might require more than one vehicle. Also, Zipcar’s driving record check is pretty extensive, so even a minor traffic violation can put chances of obtaining a membership in jeopardy. But considering the high alternative cost of catching a taxi, Zipcar’s pros far outweigh the cons. Other alternate transportation options include Wheelz, a new company that uses students’ personal vehicles as fleet cars, and Zimride, a ride-share program that allows members of the USC community to offer or accept rides from other students.
With CA Taxi, the Expo Line and alternate carpool and car-sharing options providing several options for transportation, students can find an appropriate way of escaping the quad and enjoying a daylong study break in Los Angeles.

From an aerial view, Los Angeles looks like a never-ending series of packed neighborhoods and congested roads.
For new students about to touch down in the City of Angels, that might be a little overwhelming. Just how bad is bad traffic? How many people does one have to push through to get around on the streets?
Tangles and traffic · The many roads of Los Angeles — and life — are reflected in Chris Burden’s “Metropolis II,” at LACMA. Viewers make use of the room’s different angles and areas to find their own unique perspective. – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Inside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the idea of the hustle and bustle of the city comes to life through Chris Burden’s “Metropolis II,” a huge recreation of the busy atmosphere that comes with any large city.
Made of steel beams, the installation perfectly captures the city’s chaos — there are roughly 100,000 toy cars buzzing throughout a complex track that includes a six-lane freeway. As visitors walk around the entire work, they can spot carefully constructed buildings with a complex track woven through for the many speeding toy cars. It possesses the most obvious facets of a sprawling city — loud, seemingly endless traffic and buildings upon buildings.
During most hours, the creation lies dormant and viewers can follow the complex weavings of the track and admire the intricate architecture of the buildings sans the recreated city noise. But during weekend hours at the museum, the sculpture comes to life as the cars start racing throughout their given pathways in a rainbow flurry of movement.
Viewers can walk around the piece or venture upstairs to view it from afar; either view creates the same sense of a constant energy and flow. Visitors of all ages gather round the work and snap photos, laugh at one movement or another, study a building that just came into their line of vision or simply stand back to take in the exhibit as a whole.
The person in charge of starting the cars and maintaining the flow of movement stands inside, sans shoes, equipped with earplugs. In many ways, then, the sculpture becomes an experience, not just a work of art.
“Metropolis II” can be seen multiple times without getting boring — you can stand in a different area, tilt your head for a different angle and exchange the excitement of seeing it for the first time for a newfound appreciation from a second view.
Likewise, USC might look the same to newcomers and those returning, but to each person it will be the stepping stone to something completely different. From the outside, campus might look buzzing to the brim and filled beyond capacity, but that’s no reason to search for a pair of earplugs and wait for it to settle down — instead, the bustle should serve as inspiration for taking your experience in full swing, making of it whatever you will.
What’s consistent in Burden’s work is the emotional exhilaration. The work might seem stressful, intriguing, exciting or fearful to different visitors. Because of the wide range of reactions, the smaller parts of the “Metropolis II” become parts of a greater whole — the experience itself.
In a similar way, the students, buildings and noises of campus become part of the greater adventures that new students experience when they come to campus this fall semester.
Does the experience then become overwhelming and frightening? It’s all in the eye of the beholder. Surely some visitors will leave LACMA with a near headache while others will be simply amused. Yet both types of visitors will get into their cars and head back to the real metropolis awaiting them outside. No experience will be the same for two students, even when all the same factors make up their first day.
Just as visitors gaze on the mechanical makeup of the work — the architectural character of the buildings, the swerves in the freeway track, the colors of the toy cars — new students will take in USC’s exterior. Eventually, they will discover even its most hidden gems and learn just how loud campus gets during peak hours. But the buildings and people ultimately make up one experience that will differ from person to person. “Metropolis II,” as does campus, only gets so busy during a certain time period — but the overall experience lasts much longer. It’s ultimately up to the viewer whether the work makes a positive mark on them, just as the students must decide exactly what they will do with all the elements of the campus experience.
Burden’s work crafts a relatively small space into an idea far too large to fit inside one room. The best thing a viewer can take away from the piece is the idea that perhaps sometimes we get too trapped in all the movement of a metropolis. It’s a fragment of a huge world, an environment filled with possibilities.
In the same way, USC’s campus is ultimately part of a greater whole —the future that students craft when they leave its grounds.

The USC campus is developing rapidly into its own small city.
USC Hospitality constantly updates restaurant services. The bath products unavailable at the USC Pharmacy can likely be found at the bookstore. The Fisher Museum hosts art exhibits of the highest caliber.
We even have our own version of the horse-and-buggy: the bicycle-powered Trojan Chariots.
If you were to never leave campus proper, you could survive, even thrive, as a healthy, involved and content USC student.
But there will come a time, sooner than most new students realize, when the cocoon-like world that is the USC campus no longer seems so convenient or thrilling.
When that happens, there is a bottomless well of culture waiting for you beyond the confines of Jefferson, Figueroa, Exposition and Vermont.
That well is called Los Angeles.
The city will seem massive and menacing and almost entirely inconvenient. That’s because it is.
But drive the distance to the Getty, ride the monorail and take in the panoramic views of Los Angeles — a scene that rivals some of the impressionist ones inside its Richard Meier-designed buildings — and you’ll realize why traversing the obstacle courses of this city are so entirely worth it.
There are numerous, mostly time-consuming, ways to get to the beach. But when you hit the endless stretch of blond sand and blonder beach bums, the efforts taken to get there will hardly seem like a big deal.
A Sunday morning at the Rose Bowl flea market or Hollywood farmers’ market requires an early wake-up call and parking or public transport difficulties. An arrival at either, though, is the best kind of sensory overload: Tent cities with passionate, quirky  vendors selling the hardest-to-find, most quality vegetables or vintage denim.
What Los Angeles has to offer, it offers spectacularly and wholeheartedly. It’d be a shame for you to ignore it.
To know Los Angeles is to eat and shop and drive. Or maybe it’s to surf and bar crawl and museum hop. Los Angeles, more so than most other cities, is defined in the way you’d most like to define it.
Exploring Los Angeles’ past and discovering its present is by no means easy.
The city’s history is rich but relatively recent. The public transportation system, so often a hallmark of great cities, will take 20 more years to develop into a worthy means of getting around.
Merely being here -— unlike, say, spending time in New York or Austin, Boston or Chicago — won’t give you insight into the place you now call home.
There’s plenty of literature on  the topic of Los Angeles. You can read about it all you want, and you should — it’s a positively strange, fascinating place. But don’t forget to explore for yourself because that’s when “Los Angeles” truly means something.
Start by driving around, catching a bus, hopping on the Expo Line. Los Angeles has many neighborhoods, each more different from the next, for you to discover.
Take in a concert at the Greek or the Hollywood Bowl, where the best musicians perform in equally impressive surroundings. Do something “touristy” like a studio tour; it will give you insight into an industry that largely built this city. Spend a late afternoon in Little Tokyo checking out the funky contemporary art at MOCA and follow it with a meal of cook-it-yourself shabu-shabu.
And when you emerge from that bottomless well back on to our newly tiled, fountain-filled campus, you will appreciate the city and your school that much more.
You’ve got two worlds here. Make the best of them both.

Los Angeles is a city with two faces.
On one level, there’s the superficial side of the city. It’s the tourist idea of what Los Angeles is: glitz and glamour in Hollywood and rough neighborhoods in South Los Angeles. It’s a pretty polarized dynamic of wealth and poverty. At a quick glance, it’s easy to see the city as it’s stereotyped.
But there’s the other level that tourists don’t really see. It’s the Los Angeles for people who live in the city and understand that Los Angeles has had a rich history since its founding, through the true-to-life noir days of gangster Mickey Cohen to today’s eclectic mix of cultures, all united by highways and streets. For Angelenos, native and new, there are places to see local acts, grab an excellent meal in an a historic building or spend a day exploring.
And no neighborhood represents that mix better than Downtown. It is, after all, one of the oldest parts of the city, and it shows its age. It’s not decrepit, but instead of tearing things down to start over, the area rebuilds itself, putting new stores and homes in grand decades-old buildings from the early booming years of the city.
Though Downtown has gone through a revitalization in recent years, there’s much to see besides the popular tourist areas. Yes, L.A. Live and the Staples Center have become centerpieces of sorts for the “new” Downtown, but there’s far more to this lifestyle. The neighborhood can often look into the city’s culture as created by those who live there, for those who live there.
Downtown is usually bustling during the daytime, but at night, restaurants spring to life, bars open up and normal store fronts give way to events you can’t find during the day.
For those old enough to drink legally, Downtown doesn’t have as big a focus on nightclubs as more western parts of Los Angeles do. Instead, it boasts some of the best bars in the city — like the mezcal and tequila-centric Rivera — and some hidden treasures in unexpected places, such as Bar & Kitchen inside the O Hotel on Eighth and Flower streets where a single drink can include whiskey, rum, anisette, rhubarb, lime, pineapple and bitters.
For a hidden treasure, head to The Varnish in the back of Cole’s — itself home to an excellent 1930s-style bar — on Sixth and Main streets. The small and often-packed space just won the Spirited Awards’ Best American Cocktail Bar at this year’s Tales of the Cocktail convention.
If you really need to be at a club, try the 21-and-up joint The Edison. It combines a club atmosphere with high-end drinks, as well as an Art Deco design. It’s even housed in what was the city’s first private power plant, so there’s more history there than just retro design.
And for the especially low-key drinker — if spirits and clubs are a bit too much — try Buzz at Fifth and Spring streets. It’s a beer and wine specialty shop with selections ranging from California-brewed IPAs to Trappist ales. Best of all, it has weekly tasting events for both drink options.
Music lovers will also find plenty to enjoy in Downtown. Though the neighborhood doesn’t have the music scene of the Sunset Strip, spots like The Smell have become landmarks for live music. There, one can nod their head to everything from California punk rock to experimental electronica. For a solid jazz setup, head to the Blue Whale Bar.
As a haven for the arts, Downtown competes with, and even surpasses, the more ostensibly arts-focused cultures of Silverlake and Venice. Gallery Row, centered around Spring Street, is littered with photo galleries, painting displays and new installations. And that’s all before running into the large, well-known museums like MOCA.
At night there are usually events, special exhibits and even the occasional party.
And if film is your passion, visit the Downtown Independent, a movie theater showing everything from Japanese samurai movies to local short films.
The neighborhood’s art focus goes beyond galleries. The Los Angeles Theatre Center not only has plays, but also speaking events with leaders like Egyptian activist Wael Ghonim and art exhibits in the main lobby.
In a city as big as Los Angeles, it’s easy to get overwhelmed and seek out the landmarks and hot spots. But it’s worth checking  out the side of the city that isn’t in the travel guides. Once in Downtown, it’s easy to walk around and explore. It’s a dense, truly eclectic neighborhood with a seemingly unlimited amount of places to see art, grab a bite to eat or just stop to take in the city.
Los Angeles’ future is unwritten, but exploring Downtown is a great way to see the city’s past and to experience its present.
