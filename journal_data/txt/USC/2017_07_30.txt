Daniels, who is ranked the No. 1 quarterback in his class by 247Sports, chose USC out of a pool of talented programs including Alabama, another powerhouse school in Michigan and five Pac-12 schools — Washington, Cal, Colorado, Stanford and Washington. Daniels narrowed his list down to Stanford, Washington, Michigan and USC last week.
Besides Daniels, Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., produced stand-out Trojan quarterbacks Matt Barkley and Matt Leinart. 
As a sophomore last season, Daniels went 315-for-423 with 4,849 passing yards and 67 touchdowns. He is seen as a dual-threat quarterback with a very efficient arm. 
The junior told Scout.com that Tyson Helton, USC’s quarterbacks coach and the brother of head coach Clay Helton, was his primary recruiter.
“I love the coaching staff,” Daniels said. “Tyson Helton was my primary recruiter and we really hit it off. He’s a lot like Clay Helton, very easy to talk with, very personable and one of those guys you know cares about you as more than just a football player.
Daniels joins four-star linebacker De’Gabriel Floyd as the only other class of 2019 commit. He will add to a USC quarterback depth chart that includes redshirt freshman Matt Fink and freshman Jack Sears behind Heisman-favorite and starter Sam Darnold. Daniels gives the Trojans a nice cushion at his position, as he will be seen as the starter-in-waiting if and when Darnold declares for the NFL Draft. 
For USC, the news takes the sting out of losing Matt Corral, a top quarterback recruit in the class of 2018 who de-committed from the Trojans in June and instead went to Florida. Daniels could be the starter at USC as a true freshman as soon as he steps on campus in 2019 should Darnold forgo his redshirt senior season.
Though he will only be a junior next season, Daniels said he is confident in his decision. 
“I know it’s early but I feel like I’m ready. When you know, you know and I know USC is the place for me,” he said to Scout.com. “I just didn’t see any reason to put off the decision when I’m 100 percent sure of what I want.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Alabama won the national championship last season. Alabama lost in the national championship game to Clemson. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Matt Boermeester, who kicked the game-winning field goal to secure the Rose Bowl victory for USC last season, is officially off the football team. 
Boermeester was not listed on the roster as the Trojans began fall camp at Howard Jones Field on Saturday.
A USC spokesperson also confirmed that Boermeester is no longer enrolled as a student at the University, but did not elaborate.
Boermeester, a redshirt junior last season, was suspended in February for a “student code of conduct” matter.
“Student disciplinary records and proceedings regarding any matter of student conduct are confidential and protected by law,” the University said in a statement back in February regarding Boermeester’s suspension. “While this student code of conduct issue is being investigated, the student will not be representing the University as a member of its athletic team.”
USC has specified neither the nature of the student conduct issue nor the results of any investigations into the matter. When asked about general procedures in handling student-athlete misbehavior, a USC spokesperson said in March that the athletics department defers to student affairs in handling student conduct cases to assure that “student-athletes are treated like all students and do not receive special treatment because of their athletic standing.”
Boermeester was 18-of-25 last season on field goals, with his USC career culminating in the 46-yard field goal to topple Penn State in the final seconds of the Rose Bowl. 
Redshirt freshman Michael Brown is currently the only remaining kicker on the roster, though incoming freshman Chase McGrath is expected to earn a spot alongside Brown.
Boermeester’s release from the team marks the fourth instance in the last year in which disciplinary actions were taken against USC football players for student conduct code violations. The previous three instances involved linebackers Osa Masina, Don Hill and Jabari Ruffin. 
Masina was removed from USC after being charged with one count of rape and two counts of forcible sodomy in September. Hill was also taken off the team in September for his role in the Masina case. Ruffin was removed from the program in October for an unspecified student conduct issue after being given a half-game suspension in September for stomping on the groin of an opposing player in last season’s opener against Alabama. 
Clearly, USC didn’t learn from the UVA rape hoax.
With an uber-vengeful NCAA hounding  and over-prosecuting Reggie Bush we don’t need an in-house Salem Witch Court, our over-reaching Title IX Committee. 
Transparency? Why do I read of that Committee’s transgressions in the UCLA Times Sports Section today?
