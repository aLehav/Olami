Since President Donald Trump was elected into office, much of the mainstream news coverage has been devoted to the investigation into Russia’s influence on the United States election. But instead, we should turn our attention to within our own borders and examine the number of ineligible voters participating in our elections. 
California chooses to ignore the warnings of internal election fraud by continuing its loosened election security procedures. The state has been at the forefront of finding new, innovative ways to increase its voter turnout, especially among young people. But it is a mistake for California to prioritize voter participation over election security. 
In 2013, the state pioneered a new program by passing a bill allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote, allowing them to automatically be registered when they turn 18. Just last week, California’s secretary of state boasted about the landmark 100,000 teenagers who have pre-registered through this program. But voter fraud data begs the question: How many of these teenagers will actually be eligible to vote when they turn 18? 
The Washington Times reports that close to 5.7 million noncitizens voted in the 2008 presidential election, and the National Review reports that there are over 3.5 million more people registered to vote than there are eligible voters. San Diego County was found to have 38 percent more registered voters than eligible voters, revealing more than 800,000 ghost voters. Los Angeles County was found to have 112 percent voter registration, meaning there were more than 700,000 additional ghost voters. All of this translates to an undermining of the right American citizens hold most dear: the right to vote. 
Despite centuries of Americans fighting for their right to vote the United States has one of the lowest voter participation rates in the developed world at 55.7 percent, as of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

This is not to suggest that California’s plan to increase this figure is a bad idea. In fact, it’s a great program that inspires young people to become more involved and interested in politics from a younger age. Establishing voting habits early on will surely carry into later life and ensure that they continue to be civil participants. 
But this program is counterproductive if it undermines election security. After all, the entire purpose of registering to vote is to make sure potential voters are in fact eligible to vote — that voters are registered in only one state and county, that they are alive (a Pew report found 1.8 million deceased Americans were registered to vote in the 2012 election) and, of course, that they are citizens.
An ideal voting society should include a secure election with only eligible voters participating and a voter registration program that encourages as much participation as possible. 
One question that comes to mind is: Why even have voter registration in the first place? The best voting program would be one that does not require voters to register before they cast their ballots. Take North Dakota for example. It is the only state that does not require its voters to register before they vote; North Dakota citizens can simply show up to the polls and cast their votes, maximizing efficiency and access. That said, North Dakota still ensures its elections are secure by requiring its voters to present valid government IDs proving their voter eligibility. 
Several states have these voter-ID laws that require voters to prove their citizenship and voter eligibility before they cast a ballot. California’s laws are not as strict. The state does not have a photo ID requirement, and it even allows its voters to present a copy of a recent utility bill or a student identification card as sufficient ID. 
California should indeed be commended for reaching 100,000 pre-registered voters. The state’s innovative pre-registration plan has been adopted by several other states who look to increase youth voter participation. 
However, California’s plan fails to address the overarching issue of election security. The program only meets one of the elements of an ideal voting society. Yes, it increases participation in politics, but our ideal scenario is not to merely increase voter turnout. Rather, it’s to increase voter turnout among legal voters.

As of Friday, a record 100,000 16 to 17 year olds in California had signed up for pre-registration to vote. Pre-registration could increase the dismal voter turnout rates among young people in California — and other states should adopt a similar process.
Starting with advocacy following the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., students have taken to the streets and social media to express their views. But it’s unclear whether new waves of student civic engagement will yield tangible political pressure at the polls.
For organizers, turning existing digital activism into a substantial political voice has been a challenge from the start. Some blame social media activism — or, as it’s referred to among skeptics, “slacktivism” — for providing young people an outlet to feel like they are engaging in advocacy without actually making concrete contributions.
Today’s distinctive combination of 21st century technology and political anxiety has introduced vast swaths of political engagement apps. The apps Votespotter and Stance make it easier to contact members of Congress, while Voter — known as “Tinder for politics” — allows users to swipe left or right to confer political preferences and shows users the political representatives with whom their views align best. We the People features more community discussion about political issues, and the app Congress organizes the bills going through the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Despite the onslaught of voter engagement apps, it’s hard to know whether increased voter engagement with our iPhones truly increases voter turnout rates at the ballot box. But maybe, in tandem with young voter initiatives like California’s pre-registration, these kinds of politically active forums can become real political engines for outreach and engagement.

Among all other age groups, 18 to 29-year-olds have consistently boasted the lowest voter turnout rates, which have significant consequences. According to the United States Election Project, in 2016, 43 percent of eligible 18 to 29-year-olds voted in the presidential election; compare that with 30 to 44-year-olds at 57 percent, 45 to 59-year-olds at 66 percent and voters over 60 at 71 percent. The policy implications of this voting pattern, which has persisted across the last 16 presidential and congressional elections, are obvious: Older voters’ interests are consistently overrepresented, while younger voters’ are consistently underrepresented.
Encouraging young people to register and to vote is not, as some cynical conservatives think, an effort to skew the vote Democratic. In fact, young voters cast more diverse votes than one might think — the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement reports that in 2016, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton received 55 percent of the vote among 18 to 29-year-olds, 37 percent supported now-President Donald Trump and 8 percent voted for third-party candidates or did not cast a vote for the presidency. Compare that to the general election, in which Clinton received 48 percent of the popular vote, while Trump received 46 percent of the vote and third-party candidates received 6 percent of the vote. It’s true that young voters tend to skew slightly more Democratic than the overall population, in the 2016 election. But it wasn’t by a large margin.
For this reason, it’s not just Democrats who should work to improve voter turnout among young people. Youth voter engagement is essential to a representative democracy to ensure all interest groups exercise their opportunities to exert political will. It’s also important because engaging people to vote as young people increases the likelihood that they will continue to vote in the future; it creates a pipeline for voter expression that forges the lifeblood of our democracy.
During a time when voting rights are under threat, policy initiatives that lower the barriers to voting are more important than ever. The 2016 presidential election was the first presidential election in 50 years to take place without the full force of the monumental Voting Rights Act, which faced Supreme Court challenge in 2013. As a result, 14 states instituted new voter suppression policies, including reductions in early voting, racially-charged voter ID laws and a whopping 868 fewer polling sites. While the full extent of these policies are largely unknown, one 2014 study found 12.8 percent of voters in a Texas Congressional district cited a lack of voter-acceptable IDs as a reason for not voting, even though only 2.7 percent of those voters actually lacked the acceptable ID.
The unprecedented political energy among teenagers after the school shooting in Parkland is an opportunity to reverse some of these trends. Under significant structural barriers, young and marginalized people must be given the tools to make voting as easy as possible.
Voting rights have always lacked the appeal of other, more conspicuous policy debates. And at a time when stunning political distractions constantly plaster headlines, maintaining focus on this structural mechanism of divvying political power is crucial. Its foundational role and transformative impact warrants our full attention.

USC men’s basketball junior forward Bennie Boatwright announced Monday to CBS Sports that he will stay at USC for his senior season, electing to finish out his career as a Trojan despite rumors that he might take his chances in the NBA Draft.

After much speculation regarding Boatwright and his desire to play professional basketball, the former Village Christian player confirmed that he will be back again next season to join a USC roster that has lost four starters to the NBA. 
While Boatwright features the size, athleticism, defensive ability and shooting touch needed to be a star forward in the NBA, a medial collateral ligament sprain in his left knee his sophomore season and an infected foot blister and partially torn patellar tendon in his left knee this year permanently kept Boatwright on the bench for a majority of the 2017-18 campaign. 
Boatwright played in 23 games for Southern Cal this season and was second on the squad with 13.6 points per game to go along with four 20-point games and 19 blocks. 
The bright spot for the junior came during a three-game stretch at the Diamond Head Classic when Boatwright put down three-straight games of 23 or more points, including a 33-point performance in the finale that featured a buzzer-beater 3 to seal a USC victory. 
Although Boatwright and fellow junior forward Chimezie Metu both attracted NBA attention last season, the Trojan Towers elected to stay at USC for their junior years. 
This season, however, Metu graduated from USC a year early and declared for the NBA Draft with scouts projecting the Lawndale product to land somewhere in the second round.
The announcement of Boatwright’s return to Troy also comes just months after a Yahoo! Sports report was released, citing documents in the infamous FBI scandal that alleged Bennie Boatwright,Sr. had accepted at least $2,000 from a potential agent. 
The USC Athletic Department has since cleared Boatwright to play and stated that they did not find Boatwright participated in any wrongdoing. 
As for now, Boatwright is eligible to play for USC next year and will be a pillar for a USC team that not only lost solid defenders in McLaughlin, Stewart and Melton, but also the interior presence of Metu and sophomore Harrison Henderson, who announced he will transfer at the end of this year.
Along with Boatwright, forwards sophomore Nick Rakocevic and freshman Victor Uyaelunmo will earn featured minutes for a USC roster that lacks bigs.
Expected to play big minutes off the bench will be incoming 6-foot-8 recruit J’Raan Brooks who re-committed to play for the Trojans after the Tony Bland improper benefits scandal broke.
Brooks, and potentially a transfer from another D-I school, could be USC’s second line of defense once Boatwright and Rakocevic take a seat on the bench. 
Either way, bringing back Boatwright solidifies USC’s frontcourt for the 2017-2018 season and will provide the Trojans with a lethal scorer and dangerous defender.

The end of Spring Camp looms closer as the Trojan football team begins its last week of practice before the summer. The team has one practice left before Saturday’s final session at Cromwell Field. 
QB Battle
Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman,Jr. showed flashes of brilliance in 2017, recording 404 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns. Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan
Quarterbacks redshirt sophomore Matt Fink and redshirt freshman Jack Sears bounced back Saturday from their tough outing last weekend and impressed with strong performances. Both were more decisive and accurate with the ball, connecting on some deep throws that had been absent the previous weekend as well as doing a better job taking care of the football. 
“With all three quarterbacks, the ball moved,” head coach Clay Helton said. “They didn’t make critical errors, they took command, and had great timing, decision making and accuracy.” 
With top quarterback recruit J.T. Daniels set to join the fray under center in the summer, the two scholarship quarterbacks on the roster will look to make their last pushes to prove themselves this week before the five-star recruit’s arrival.
Practice Notes
Redshirt freshman cornerback Greg Johnson had a solid day, breaking up a couple of passes from each quarterback and looking poised in downfield coverage for much of the day. 
Sophomore safety Bubba Bolden also impressed, getting a would-be sack as well as performing well in coverage. Senior cornerback Imam Marshall continued his strong spring, remaining sound in his coverages and almost picking off a short route that would’ve gone back for 6 had he caught it in a game. 
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns kept performing as he has all spring, exhibiting his trademark hands and route running. Sophomore receiver Velus Jones also looked strong catching the ball, continuing what appears to be a breakout spring for him. Early in the spring, Helton said he wanted a receiver to step up behind Vaughns and Michael Pittman, Jr. and Jones is looking to fill that role.
 “I know the playbook way more than I did before,” Jones said. “I’ve been learning never to make the same mistake twice. Knowing the system more, now I’m able to do what I wanted to do.”
If his performance carries over through the summer and into the fall, Jones could very well secure an important spot in the receiving rotation.
Injury updates
Sophomore offensive tackle Austin Jackson missed practice Tuesday to deal with a mild case of tendonitis in his foot. Helton believes the issue to be minor and expects him to recover in time for Thursday’s practice. Jackson has impressed for much of the spring as he competes for the starting left tackle spot with redshirt junior Clayton Johnston.
Sophomore defensive tackle Brandon Pili practiced today after missing time this spring due to a back issue. Pili will look to solidify his spot on the defensive line rotation heading into the summer.
Helton offered an update on sophomore running back Stephen Carr’s condition, as he looks to return from the back surgery that has kept him out for all of spring. 
“Stephen’s doing really good, kind of ahead of schedule to be honest with you from what the trainers and doctors are saying,” Helton said. “Right now, he’s on pace to be full speed for training camp.” 
This summer will be huge for Carr, as he will have the opportunity to fill the starting running back role vacated by Ronald Jones’ departure to the NFL.

In what was potentially the biggest match of the season for the women’s beach volleyball team, a new-look USC squad took on the No. 2-ranked Pepperdine Waves at Merle Norman Stadium Tuesday, falling short 2-3.

The dual opened up with an almost brand new pair, senior Jenna Belton and freshman Haley Hallgren, taking on the dominant Pepperdine duo of Skylar Caputo and Alexis Filippone.
On paper, the two pairs were total opposites. Hallgren and Belton had only played once together prior to Tuesday, while Caputo and Filippone came in with a nearly impeccable 20-1 record. Early on, Belton and Hallgren held their own, keeping the first set close at 11-10 before falling 21-19.
In the second set, Caputo and Filippone showed their dominance by jumping early over USC with a score of 12-4. Though Belton and Hallgren fought back to make it 13-8, the chemistry between Caputo and Filippone proved too much to overcome and Pepperdine took its first points of the dual by winning the set 21-12.
On the fifth court, graduate transfer Alexandra Poletto and junior Katrina Kernochan took on Maddie Dilfer and Nikki Lyons of Pepperdine. Like their counterparts on the fourth court, Kernochan and Poletto fought hard in the first set and gained a 18-17 lead, but were unable to seize the moment and the Waves used a 4-1 run to take the opener 21-17.
Much like the first set, Kernochan and Poletto found themselves in a good position tied at 16-16. Despite the effort, Lyons and Dilfer were simply too much to handle and took the second set 21-19. A common theme of Poletto and Kernochan’s matches is the tendency for opponents to target Kernochan on serves. At one point, Kernochan had received 23 serves while Poletto only received two.
After the dual, head coach Anna Collier hinted that there could be some more big changes at the fourth and fifth slots for USC moving forward. She had already decided to make some “shake-ups” after last week’s UCLA loss. After losing both courts Tuesday, Collier said that another change could be expected.
With their backs against the wall again, the Women of Troy looked to their first three pairs to ignite a comeback.
Once again, the first slot pair of junior Abril Bustamante and freshman Tina Graudina proved to be a bright spot for USC. Taking on Corinne Quiggle and Deahna Kraft of Pepperdine, Graudina and Bustamante made their presences felt early by going up 12-8 and taking the first set 21-17. In the second set, Quiggle and Kraft were unable to handle the onslaught of powerful shots coming from USC’s most consistent pair and the Women of Troy were able to get their first point of the dual off a 21-15 second set win.
Graudina attributed their success to an “opposites attract” type of relationship.
“I couldn’t have hoped for a better partner,” she said of Bustamante. “She is always excited and I have to calm her down sometimes but that’s why it works well.”
USC would pick up their second point of the dual on the third court with senior Terese Cannon and freshman Sammy Slater taking on Heidi Dyer and Gigi Hernandez of Pepperdine.
Cannon and Slater came out firing early, taking an 11-5 lead early, winning the first set 21-15. In the second set, Roh and Bauer responded by going on a run of their own and jumping on USC 9-12 early in the second set. With their backs against the wall, Cannon and Slater fought back, going on a 12-7 run the rest of the way to tie the dual for USC.
With the dual tied at 2, all eyes turned to the second slot where junior Brianna Sizemore and sophomore Joy Dennis squared off against Madalyn Roh and Brook Bauer. Early on, it was Pepperdine who seemed able to handle the pressure, taking the first set 21-13 despite the match being close at 13-10 early on. In an intense second set, both sides traded blows, at one point tying at 19. Eventually it was Roh and Bauer who would finish strong and secure the dual for Pepperdine by winning 21-19.
With the Women of Troy unable to consistently defeat elite teams, Collier said she would continue to find the “missing piece” for USC as the regular season winds down.
“We don’t get in the flow to win when we need to,” Collier said. “When we need to make a push on the other team, we rock on our heels. If you let these good teams know that you are rocking, they will push you all the way back.” 
The Women of Troy will travel to Seattle this weekend for the Pac-12 North Invitational where they will take on the Cal Bears, Oregon Ducks, Stanford Cardinal and Washington Huskies.

USC men’s basketball ended its 2017-18 season on a disastrous note. 
Between the team’s NCAA Tournament snub, the departure of sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton and its embarrassing second-round exit in the NIT, it appeared as though USC hoops fans had little to celebrate and even less to look forward to.
But on Monday, the program finally received good news — the team’s Twitter account announced junior forward Bennie Boatwright will return for his senior year and forgo the NBA Draft. His decision appears to be motivated, in part, by a devastating knee injury he suffered in February. 
“A key factor in Bennie Boatwright’s decision to return to USC was that he is still rehabbing from his season-ending knee injury,” tweeted Joey Kaufman, a reporter for the Orange County Register. “It would be difficult for him to work out for NBA teams.”
Now, next year’s prospective roster looks much less barren than before. With senior guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart running out of eligibility, junior forward Chimezie Metu presumably entering the draft and Melton leaving the program, USC would’ve had to rely on transfers in order to be competitive in 2018-19. But Boatwright’s return (if he’s healthy) guarantees the Trojans at least one reliable scorer come next winter. 
While it’s undeniably positive news for USC fans, Boatwright’s return came as quite a surprise. Boatwright was embroiled in the never-ending Tony Bland scandal in February, when Yahoo! Sports reported that he and Metu received improper benefits. Boatwright denied the claims and was never ruled ineligible by the University. Still, conventional wisdom indicated that he’d depart sooner rather than later in order to avoid the NCAA’s reckoning, should that day ever come. 
But instead, Boatwright is back. Beyond affording him a chance to rehab his knee, a return to campus should benefit Boatwright in other ways too. He’s always been proficient as a volume scorer (13.0 points per game during his career), but struggled mightily with efficiency. In 2017-18, Boatwright has shot .415 percent from the field — the lowest among USC starters, while his .346 3-point clip marked a career low. 
Next season will be an interesting one for Boatwright. As the team’s primary scorer, he needs to improve his shot selection, while also taking more shots. Junior guard Jonah Mathews (9.3 points per game this season) and sophomore forward Jordan Usher (4.8 points per game) should help ease the load, but make no mistake: This is Boatwright’s team now. In the limelight, his strengths and weaknesses will be exposed to NBA scouts like never before. 
During his career, he’s had difficulty gaining separation in one-on-one situations and thus has developed a habit of hoisting up contested jumpers and floaters. His reckless style of play has created many highlight plays and memorable moments, but it’s also hampered his consistency. Boatwright’s quickness probably isn’t going to improve, especially with multiple knee and hip injuries under his belt. But he can still work on improving as a passer during his senior season, which would add a much-needed dimension to his shot-heavy game. 
Boatwright’s frame (6’10”, 225 pounds) and shooting potential make him a solid NBA prospect at the stretch-four position. But his knee injury, coupled with concerns about his passing and defensive ability, would have surely kept him out of the lottery this season. A return to campus will allow him to hone in on those deficiencies and potentially improve his stock for the 2019 NBA Draft. 
Boatwright’s return appears to be be a win-win situation. USC basketball gets one of its top scorers back on an otherwise decimated roster, while Boatwright gets another chance to prove himself to NBA scouts. 
Head coach Andy Enfield still has plenty of holes to fill, and the threat of NCAA sanctions still looms in the distance like an army of White Walkers. But for a program enveloped by scandal and misfortune since September, Boatwright’s return offers an ounce of much-needed good news. 
Here are a couple of things I enjoyed in sports this week:
Quinn Cook signs two-year deal with Warriors 
Coming out of college, Golden State Warriors guard Quinn Cook was never expected to have a successful NBA career. He went un-drafted out of Duke in 2015, played in the G-League and bounced around the league on a series of 10-day contracts. Now, after suiting up for five different teams in three years, Cook finally has a home. On Tuesday, reigning NBA champion Golden State inked Cook to a two-year deal, ensuring he will be a key part of the team’s playoff run. 
Cook has been instrumental in keeping the Warriors afloat in the absence of Stephen Curry, who’s been out with an MCL tear. Over the past 13 games, he’s averaging 17.8 points and 5.2 assists per contest. 
Cook’s overachieving play was not only rewarded with a new contract, but also the chance to play for an NBA title. You can bet the Atlanta Hawks and Dallas Mavericks regret cutting him now. 
Roma upsets Barcelona 
In the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final, Barcelona thrashed Italian-side Roma 4-1. It was an expected result — the Spanish league leaders are likely the most talented and complete team in the world. 
The second leg, however, featured anything but the expected. Roma scored an early goal in the sixth minute and never let up, ultimately shocking the world with a 3-0 win that tied the aggregate score at 4-4. Roma won the tiebreaker on away goals, completing one of the most unlikely upsets in Champions League history. 
Barcelona stars Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez will surely have the last laugh in the end, as they’ll have many more opportunities to win championships (they’re on course to win La Liga this year). But right now, it’s Roma’s moment and their win is a reminder that anything can happen in sports.

With April comes a flurry of excitement and anticipation, not only because it signals the end of the semester, but also because of the beloved Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. For the next two weekends, campus will be relatively barren from the lack of students, and for those who are not a part of the desert festivities, it may seem like the world revolves around the event. But that said, there’s other ways to spend your weekend. Here is a comprehensive list of shows, expos and events that are much gentler on the wallet while this year’s festival season finally draws to a close. 
 Weekend 1:
Assscat
This weekend, the Upright Citizens Brigade’s longest lasting improv comedy group, Assscat, will perform at Upright Citizen Brigade Theatre Franklin on Saturday and Upright Citizen Brigade Theatre Sunset on Sunday. Founding members Matt Walsh, Matt Besser and Ian Roberts will take the stage, likely bringing special guests as well — previous guests have included actresses Rebel Wilson, Amy Poehler and Lena Dunham. An audience member will give the group a random word, and they and their guest will build their show around it for the rest of the night. This show is sure to be a fun night of laughs, and the program will start at 8 p.m. Saturday and 7 p.m. Sunday. Sundays are free, but tickets are available on a first come first serve basis. A guaranteed spot at the Saturday show will cost $10. 
Following the march which will take place from 10 to 11 a.m., a series of expos will be taking place throughout Downtown L.A. Photo from Facebook.
March for Science
The annual March for Science takes place on Saturday, in support of better legislation regarding science-based issues and more diversity in STEM fields. Last year, the event drew over 50,000 people to Pershing Square, and even more are expected to show up to this year. The march will take place from 10 to 11 a.m., and for the rest of the day, there will be myriad talks on the future of STEM in Los Angeles, environmental justice and getting involved in policy making. There will also be expos set up across Downtown hosted by companies such as Rolling Robots, Science for Kids and the Columbia Science Center.
Art Up!
The Beyond the Lines Gallery, located about 10 minutes away from USC in the Fashion District of downtown Los Angeles, will close its four-weekend series of pop-up galleries this weekend. Entry is $5 and grants visitors access to the gallery for the whole night, as well as live music, vendors, food and a comedy show. Every weekend has been completely different, switching up the lineup of artists for a new experience. The pop-up opens at 6:30 p.m. and runs until 11 p.m. this Thursday through Saturday.
Weekend 2:
L.A. Times Festival of Books
Like last year, the Festival of Books will be held on USC’s campus for the entirety of next weekend. Though the sheer number of attendees is reminiscent of a Coachella crowd, this event aims to rediscover old literary favorites and help visitors find new ones. The festival brings in authors and speakers across all literary genres and cultures. There will also be plenty of musical performances from genres like jazz, R&B, opera and more.  Some of this year’s popular speakers include actresses Jenna Fischer and author Junot  Díaz, as well as various USC professors. The event is the perfect way to kill a few hours, and will run from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on April 21 and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. the next day. Admission is free.
Smorgasburg L.A.
Smorgasburg is a classic foodie event that occurs almost every Sunday of the year. Located in an enclave of the Arts District called ROW DTLA, Smorgasburg is a 15-minute ride from campus, and parking is free. Sweet & Hollow and Bumble Crumpets offer Instagrammable desserts, while Cena Vegan and BaoHaus are delicious lunch options. Other lifestyle vendors include Plant Puns, which sells small handcrafted pots, and Notox Life, which specializes in  sustainable, vegan skincare products. Smorgasburg runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but if you have a particular vendor in mind, visitors are advised to come early in case vendors sell out of certain items throughout the day.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the date of the L.A. Times Festival of Books. The date has been updated. The Daily Trojan regrets this error

Colombian American singer Kali Uchis is perhaps best known for her acclaimed collaboration with Tyler, the Creator on his single “See You Again,” and her Grammy-nominated duet with Daniel Caesar on “Get You.” Her first solo endeavor, however, may skyrocket her to stardom, as Uchis released her impressive debut album Isolation on Friday.

Isolation is a 15-track saga that immerses listeners into Uchis’ world. The overall production is incredibly cohesive. Listeners are first brought into the record’s universe with a jazzy introduction, similar to the sound of Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly. 
The record is R&B-heavy, groovy and laid back. It is the perfect collection to pop in the car for a long drive on a hot summer day. While maintaining cohesion, the production is experimental at points, most notably on the track “Dead To Me,” in which Uchis details moving on from a past relationship. Its subtle club beat is one of the few upbeat moments on an otherwise mid-tempo collection of slow jams. 
The main draw of Isolation is neither the production nor the well-penned lyrics within the album. Rather, Uchis’ voice is the highlight. Her alluring vocal performance is immersive, providing a timeless vibe that is widely accessible. The most old-fashioned tracks “Flight 22” and “Feel Like a Fool” are reminiscent of Amy Winehouse, with the latter featuring a sultry saxophone riff in the background. 
Uchis reaches greater heights within the record in her well-executed collaborations with producers and other artists. An early track, “Tyrant,” features Jorja Smith, a British singer notably included on Drake’s More Life playlist. Another highlight is found on the distant cousin to “See You Again,” “After the Storm.” Where “See You Again” found Uchis supporting the track, “After the Storm” shows her leading it. 
Other notable collaborators are Tame Impala and Gorillaz. The Tame Impala-produced “Tomorrow” could just as easily have been featured on the band’s recent album, Currents. Its groovy production blends well with Uchis’ sultry voice. The Gorillaz collaboration, “In My Dreams,” is a standout in its production and lyrics, giving context to Uchis’ background and detailing a euphoric dreamscape echoed by the foggy production. The follow-up, “Gotta Get Up – Interlude,” provides a fitting counter balance to the track, again balancing a groggy production with dreamy lyrics.
The album closer “Killer” is the oldest track on the album. Uchis wrote the track at 17, when she was living out of her car. Its understated production and lyrics calmly conclude the album, leaving listeners with a haunting feeling. 
While not every track leaves a strong impression, the overall aesthetic and tone of the album is cohesive enough to maintain listeners’ attention. Uchis’ voice draws influence from SZA, Janelle Monae and Amy Winehouse, but it has a tone unique to the bilingual artist. The world of Isolation is one that demands attention.

Rejection hurts. So much, in fact, that Samantha Niemann sued the Getty Foundation in 2016 on the grounds of racial discrimination after the institution refused to consider her for an internship program that is open — explicitly and exclusively — to undergraduate students from minority groups. 
The Getty’s Multicultural Undergraduate Internship, launched in 1993, was implemented specifically to “encourage greater diversity in the professions related to museums and the visual arts.” It is through this program that I will be working with the Getty Research Institute’s web and new media team this summer as a research, programming and communications intern, alongside some of the vanguards of visual culture and gatekeepers of the art world. Needless to say, I’m thrilled — and not just because I was affirmed access to a collection of Robert Mapplethorpe’s original X Portfolio photographs. 
I began my painstaking summer internship hunt more than six months ago and had my sights set on this one from almost the very beginning. Not only will I be able to stay in Los Angeles and work within the venerated walls of the Getty’s panoramic hilltop museum, but I will also be a part of a legacy and a conversation that was finally ready to include someone like me. I’m grateful for this program because it ensures that I, as a person of color, am granted access to people and experiences I otherwise wouldn’t have had and am being actively welcomed into a realm that has traditionally been a white boys’ club. 
That’s why Niemann’s lawsuit deeply troubled me. As CBSLA first reported, she is a non-Hispanic white woman of German, Irish and Italian descent. She contended that her 3.7 GPA made her “well-qualified” for the position and alleged that she was denied the internship opportunity because she is white. Ultimately, Niemann’s lawsuit is no more than her parading privilege as a basis for legal action and racketing up a “reverse racism” storm. 
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
A study by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation found that 84 percent of non-Hispanic whites fill top-tier positions in American art museums as directors, curators and conservators. Meanwhile, notably excluded from intellectual and educational decisionmaking in the arts, nearly half of people of color employed by museums work in low-level jobs that oversee finance, facilities and security. As a result, museums’ exhibitions, publications and public programs predominantly echo the perspectives of the 84 percent white supermajority. 
The art world has a longstanding history of marginalizing underrepresented groups whether by excluding them from museums altogether or including them in a manner that exploits or exoticizes them for their cultural differences. There is a clear pattern of canonizing European and American work as forms of high art while relegating art of other cultures to artifact and archaeology. The only way to combat this is by including more members of minority groups in senior leadership roles, especially because the arts have a responsibility to perpetuate inclusive discourse and accurately represent all human experiences — not just those of white people. 
There are tragically few pipelines for managing positions held by minorities and the Getty is fiercely distinct in that it not only recognizes the racial disparities in the art world, but is actively taking steps to alter them by setting foundational segues through its Multicultural Undergraduate Internship. During the weeks of the interviewing process, I spoke with supervisors from at least three different Getty departments, all of whom were white. And yet, here I am — a hired testament to the Getty’s self-awareness and commitment to shifting its demographic makeup. 
It would be a different matter entirely if Niemann had sued over gender or class discrimination but she didn’t seem concerned with either of those things. Rather, her actions displayed a blatant tone-deafness to the Eurocentricity of American art history and proved her blindness to what true marginalization feels like. Her complaints could very well end up denying someone else a transformative opportunity that Niemann herself can find more easily elsewhere. 
I wrote in my personal statement in my initial application that writers, artists and creators of color gave me the confidence to finally harness the power of my background and exercise agency over my own experiences. I never thought that I would be so wholeheartedly embracing my Asianness, much less shouting it from the rooftops (metaphorically) by publishing columns and personal stories discussing it. Representation is critical to the development of minority identities, including my own, and I am eager to contribute to forging new narratives for others like me. I can only imagine how unapologetic and fearless I will become by the end of this summer.

Two outgoing Undergraduate Student Government officials presented a resolution Tuesday at the Senate meeting that aims to improve the compensation and benefits for custodians working at USC. 
USG President Debbie Lee proposed the budget for the 2018-19 academic year. Yuwei Xi | Daily Trojan
The USG Senate also voted unanimously in favor of approving the final USG hires for the 2018-19 academic year.
Outgoing director of external affairs Mai Mizuno explained that the  custodian resolution aims to improve conditions for custodians at USC.
“First, we want to reduce the out-of-pocket cost that they have to pay monthly for their health care from 7 percent to 6 percent,” she said. “Secondly, [we want] to have a comparable wage increase to the wages of other workers downtown.”
Mizuno later explained that the resolution does not ask for a specific wage standard for custodians. It merely asks for wages comparable to those of other custodians working downtown who make $16.60 an hour, Mizuno said.
Before presenting the details of the resolution, Mizuno read testimonials of two custodians who work at USC. She did not say their names. 
The first custodian testimonial came from a woman who has worked at USC for 11 years.
“We would like to urge students to use their voices to stand up for us and ask the administration to pressure its subcontractor, Aramark, to address our grievances,” she wrote. “For some time now we have felt undervalued, belittled and treated like we weren’t important.”
The second custodian testimonial came from a man who has worked at USC for 24 years.
“We have seen many of our coworkers become disabled as a result of our workload,” he said. “What we would like to ask all of you is to ask the University to hold the company, Aramark, to be more conscious of the workload that has caused illness, stress and increased work pressure on my coworkers.”
Mizuno also said that both the outgoing and incoming leadership of USG have supported for the resolution.
Senator Michaela Murphy delivered a message of solidarity with the entire community, explaining why she is sponsoring the resolution.
“I wish it went without saying that when we, as members of this community here at USC, say that we support fellow Trojans, we mean all Trojans here at USC,” she said. “But time and time again, we have seen that is not been the case, specifically with the treatment of the custodial staff here at USC.”
Incoming USG President Debbie Lee also presented a comprehensive USG budget proposal for the 2018-19 academic year. The total budget is roughly $2.07 million.
Part of the proposed budget is a subscription to The New York Times which would cost $8,000 and would provide 100 print copies to be distributed across campus on a daily basis. Some senators, however, raised concerns about how funding such an initiative would reduce the amount of funding that could be distributed to existing organizations that may need more funding.
The USG Senate will vote on the custodian resolution and the 2018-19 USG budget in next week’s Senate meeting.

As social issues such as homelessness continue to affect the Los Angeles community, USC Media Institute for Social Change has taken strides to address these injustices through the artistic expressions of motion pictures, messaging platforms and music.
In partnership with the imagery messaging app Kwippit, USC Media Institute for Social Change is addressing homelessness through stickers and gifs called Kwipps, which are intended to encourage social discourse. Image from Sarah London.
Since the institute was founded in 2013 by professor Michael Taylor, the USC School of Cinematic Arts has been promoting the use of film media to institute progressive social change.
According to the USC MISC website, the organization aims to strengthen SCA’s legacy. It redefines its curriculum to respond to the changing spectrum of media, arts and technology to aid leading social justice movements. According to Taylor, visual media and digital communication platforms are the new language of the 21st century. As a result, USC MISC was eager to form a partnership with digital content network Kwippit to raise awareness within a larger audience.
“When you think of the different touch points with people who are excited about ending the cycle of homelessness, you’ve got technology through the Kwippit app, you’ve got media and sharing the video through the USC MISC, and then you’ve got an entire community of hip-hop artist and musicians who are passionate about doing work around ending the cycle of homelessness,” Kwippit Chief Branding Officer Krista Treide said. 
USC MISC and Kwippit combined their digital and media imagery platforms to create a series of untraditional stickers and gifs — also known as Kwipps — to encourage discourse among the younger generation. 
“[Kwipps] are all emojis that represent different social issues,” Taylor said. 
According to Kwippit Chief Integration Officer Bill Ekeler, Kwippit came across USC MISC while looking for a partnership with an organization that communicated through visual representations and vivid imagery similar to the mobile messaging app.
“[We] want to be able to tell [our] stories through media, and to be able to customize those stories into imagery that represents what we do,” Ekeler said. “We set up a series of meetings and overtime created imagery that represented different social issues that USC MISC has undertaken to set up a channel for them specifically to raise funds and raise awareness.” 
According to Ekeler, the USC MISC Channel on Kwippit will generate $1.99 from each user’s subscription fee annually in service of alleviating homelessness rates in Los Angeles. One hundred percent of the net proceeds from channel downloads will be dedicated to foundations seeking to end homelessness.
These organizations include United Way Greater Los Angeles, Skid Row Housing Trust, Downtown Women’s Center and scholarship funding for USC MISC students creating content that addresses homelessness. 
“[Kwippit] is also a micro-donation platform … looking to connect with non-profits all over the world,” Treide said. “We have established really unique partnerships that are more innovative than traditional partnerships and traditional marketing platforms.”
On April 19, USC MISC will host a benefit concert to raise funding and awareness for homelessness. The content will take place at the Regent Theater in downtown Los Angeles and feature performers such as Del the Funky Homosapien, Ras Kass and Bishop Lamont. According to Treide, these artists have agreed to aid the micro-donation platform on Kwippit by donating profits from their music. 
Additionally, USC MISC seeks to capitalize on the impact of social media and popular culture to expand the audience scope that their humanitarian content can reach. The institution views the media technology platform as an avenue to educate and interest a wider public audience to participate in social reforms and provoke conversations. 
“We would like to say that media is the language of the 21st century … Not too long ago, people are writing in papers about all of these issues … You stand the chances of reaching a much wider audience and having a greater impact,” Taylor said. “It may be something that people will watch for its entertainment value. But in addition to being entertained by it … the film may raise their awareness of the issue. And occasionally, it might even change their behavior.” 
According to Treide, the combination of creative content generation, message micro-donation platform and music as an expressive art form is anticipated to raise funds from subscriptions and accelerate conversation around the social issue of homelessness. 
“I think getting accessing into the messaging space is very coveted,” Triede said. “Users of smartphones are more likely to open a message immediately. [Taylor] agreed that we can really change the world through media, one Kwipp at a time.”
