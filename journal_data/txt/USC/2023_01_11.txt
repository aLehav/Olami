Living side by side with the four million people of Los Angeles are one to three million unhoused cats. Without access to shelter and care, these fluffy residents are often exposed to injuries, disease and natural and human predators — a crisis which USC faculty have observed.
John Nikolai, an administrative assistant in the USC School of Philosophy, a division of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, is forming a division of his rescue, Punks for Pussies, called U Save Cats, which aims to counter the homeless cat crisis on and around campus with the help of people willing to foster and socialize cats and kittens, transport cats to medical appointments and advocate for them.
When Nikolai began working at USC about six years ago, he began seeing cats in the neighborhood he parked in. 
“There were two kittens who would sleep in a barbecue together that I would walk by everyday,”  Nikolai said. “I only came to realize the danger they were in when somebody poisoned one of the kittens intentionally. That’s when neighbors told me that there was a family in this apartment complex where those kittens had lived that were cat serial killers.”
With the help of Natalie Schaad, his supervisor, Nikolai rescued Gjeorgie, a kitten who was then neutered and adopted. Nikolai removed the other cats and kittens from that apartment complex and also got them adopted with the help of a woman in the neighborhood who was living in her car with her two dogs and a cat. 
Nikolai was quick to react when he heard about an auto graveyard where many cats lived in unsafe conditions and where kittens were born under cars.
“That woman and I started rescuing as many kittens as we could and any of the adults who were social and friendly that I could find homes for,” Nikolai said. “Any that were too feral, we started getting them fixed. That was the beginning of this rescue.”
Nikolai’s rescue effort received support from the L.A. punk community: Musicians came forward to foster cats, adopt them and play benefit concerts. After three years, the rescue came to be known as Punks for Pussies and was later registered as Lifelines for Felines.
Stephanie Babcock, a registered veterinary technician and USC alumna, first joined Nikolai’s rescue effort by caring for cats from the auto graveyard. A lack of spay-and-neuter facilities, she said, is responsible for the population crisis afflicting unhoused cats in L.A.
“The number one most euthanized animals at the shelters are neonate kittens,” Babcock said. “Preventing these from being born will actually save countless lives. Cats can have average litter sizes of three to six and they begin breeding around six months of age. There is no menopause for cats, they just keep on going if they don’t get fixed.”
Babcock also said it’s important to foster and socialize kittens before they are twelve weeks old. After that age, the process of socializing pets becomes difficult. Students can help, she said, by becoming temporary fosters — though campus housing rules restrict pet ownership in most cases.
“Studies have shown that caring for a pet is beneficial for humans. It’s good for your brain and a major milestone in growing up,” Babcock said. “Fostering would help everybody. It’s an important step to make sure these cats are going to be able to get the attention they deserve and we would love a way forward with student housing.”
With the auto graveyard being vacated after the owner of the property passed away, Nikolai moved his cats to the outskirts of Joshua Tree National Park, which the organization has been using since September 2022. There, cat families have remained together and reside in a low stress area with resources they need.
Heidi Kolkovich, vice president of Punks for Pussies, said one of her favorite memories of working with the cats was driving six of them to an art gallery in Joshua Tree, where the cats would get some of the spotlight. 
“We thought it would be the perfect space to put the cats because the art aspect is tied into what we do,” Kolkovich said. “Nikolai makes a lot of paintings to showcase the cats … but then [we had] some cats actually in person for people to see and to get a little more exposure for the rescue and what we’re doing.”
After discovering a colony of cats on the outskirts of USC’s campus and just minutes from his office last fall, Nikolai’s goal is to bring his rescue to the school. 
“Other departments have been reaching out to me for years,”  Nikolai said about homeless cats being discovered on campus. “My plan and goal is to form a subdivision of the rescue here at USC so that people who are interested, faculty, students and staff can be a part of this rescue effort.”
Nikolai said those interested can donate to the rescue via Paypal or Venmo to USaveCats@nym.hush.com. Those interested in forming and supporting this group can contact the same email address to find out how they can help. Donations, canned cat food or litter can be dropped off in-person at Nikolai’s office at MHP 113.
“These homeless cats and kittens are a voiceless part of the USC community,” Nikolai said. “If USC will support this organization and recognize it as a part of the University formally, that is a way to ensure that these animals will always have help. It’s also a way to acknowledge the fact that they are part of the USC community and a group that is worth saving.”
Correction: This article was updated at 11:30 a.m. on Jan. 12 to reflect that John Nikolai is a staff member at USC, not a faculty member. He also continues to run the Punks for Pussies rescue. The first cat mentioned by name is called Gjeorgie, not Djeorgie. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

At the first Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting of the semester Tuesday, USG discussed changes to the Fryft program, explaining that the University reverted to the ride-share model proposed pre-coronavirus was made because the single ride feature was unsustainable. In its first year, the University spent $6 million on the program, but after switching to a single-ride program last year its cost rose to $40 million. The University decided to either change back to the shared ride model or charge students a flat transportation fee, as USC is the only school in the Pac-12 who does not charge such a fee. 
Vice President Nivea Krishnan said limiting the shared ride feature to only USC students is “definitely something to look into” because many students expressed concerns about safety.
“When I used the shared ride feature we picked up a grown man and I just thought he may be a PhD student,” said senator Divya Jakatdar. 
USG encourages students who wish to express their concerns to submit feedback on its website, and plans to voice these student opinions to the University.
For the spring semester, USG hopes to establish Labor Appreciation Day, student commitment initiatives, permanent transition guides and a crisis communication working group. 
Chief programming officer Jillian Fallon presented goals for this semester, including redefining what it means to be in the programming branch and how it fits into USG, continuing to build relationships across USG and prioritizing wellbeing by providing resources to overcome challenges. 
As far as long-term objectives, Fallon hopes to work with student groups and help support their events, improve student outreach and participation in event planning, use advocacy liaisons to amplify student needs, finish the end of the term strong and support next year’s administration. 
Fallon also nominated Annmarie Easy, a sophomore majoring in political science and international relations and affairs, as the BSA assistant director and Bita Aghaee, a junior majoring in theater, as the Performing Arts Committee assistant director. 
The senate unanimously approved the nominations. 
Additionally, Chair of External Affairs Monica Rodriguez requested $3,500 for the Black Student Assembly restaurant crawl Feb. 10 and $3,500 for the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly restaurant crawl Feb. 24. 
Each restaurant crawl will feature two routes that will take students by shuttle to three restaurants. with fifty seats reserved for each route. Route 1 for the BSA restaurant crawl will feature Earle’s on Crenshaw, Little Belize and Southern Girl Desserts and route 2 will include Fixins Soul Kitchen, Who’s Hungry Caribbean and Southern Girl Desserts. Route 1 for APASA’s restaurant crawl will comprise of Thai by Trio, Woon Kitchen and Phoenix Bakery and route 2 will encompass Broken Mouth, Dollar Hits and Laroolou. 
“A lot of students are stuck in this red brick bubble where they don’t really seem to venture beyond campus,” Rodriguez said. “This will encourage [students] to be a part of a community and support business and explore the city.”
The senate unanimously approved the funding proposal.
President Hannah Woodworth highlighted USG’s fall accomplishments including the USC-Los Angeles Airport SCÜP shuttle, which gave 859 rides during fall break, 1211 rides during Thanksgiving break and 1877 rides during winter break; 3947 rides in total. USG hopes to grow that number to 9,000 students by the end of the year. 
“[Having the shuttle return to campus] is the goal,” Woodworth said. “It was a combination of budget constraints and logistical challenges such as making a spot at LAX that everyone can meet at and that the shuttle can stay at for pickup. It’s much simpler here because you can just be picked up on campus.”
Other accomplishments include the incorporation of two new assemblies — the Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly and the Joint Assembly of Military-Associated Students — and completing 20 qualitative interviews to collect feedback in regard to funding, project feasibility and resource support in preparation for the transition to the new administration.

An office in USC’s school of social work said in a memo Tuesday that it will no longer use the phrases “field work” and “going into the field” in its curriculum, instead replacing them with “practicum.” The office said the change is meant to support its anti-racist social work.
“Language can be powerful, and phrases such as ‘going into the field’ or ‘field work’ may have connotations for descendants of enslaved people and immigrant workers that are not benign,” the memo read.
In an emailed statement to the Daily Trojan, a spokesperson for the newly renamed Office of Practicum Education in the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work — the division that published the initial memo — said it is joining other universities across the nation in making the “best practice” change. The representative pointed to a similar decision by California State University, Northridge. 
Twitter pundits quickly seized on the announcement, decrying it as “woke” virtue signaling.
“The university does not maintain a list of banned or discouraged words,” wrote Interim Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Graddy in a statement to the Daily Trojan Wednesday. “We will continue to use words — including ‘field’ — that accurately encompass and describe our work and research.”
In a statement late Tuesday night, Interim Dworak-Peck Dean Vassilios Papadopoulos said the Office of Practicum Education made the decision without a formal review process by the school because it is not an academic department, adding that he understands the office made the decision to “more accurately describe its work.” 
Students — interviewed by the Daily Trojan on Tuesday both at random on the University Park Campus and specifically in the school of social work — seemed largely split on the school’s decision.
“I’ve never been in a conversation with another Black person that has had a problem with the word ‘field,’” said Leka Mpigi, a graduate student studying architecture. “But I don’t know if that’s because I’m of African descent; I’m not African American.”
Mpigi said she could see why the terms would be taken the way the memo characterized them, but suggested that USC might have “bigger problems” to focus on, specifically admitting more students of color. 
“At this point, it looks like we’re fishing for something of relevance,” Mpigi said. “It feels like a stretch.”
For its part, the office noted in its memo that its goal isn’t just to change language.
“We are committing to further align our actions, behaviors, and practices with anti-racism and anti-oppression, which requires taking a close and critical look at our profession,” memo read. “It also means continuing to work together to train social work students today who understand and embody social and racial justice.”
Paloma Williams, a junior majoring in design, said that if the phrases being replaced originated from slavery or have an offensive origin, she supports the decision. 
“Free speech doesn’t make saying offensive things OK,” Williams said.
According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term “field work” can be traced back to 1767 in uses meaning “gathering statistics or doing research out-of-doors or on-site.” Merriam-Webster’s website says the term’s first-known use was in 1686, to mean “a temporary fortification thrown up by an army in the field.”
“I have no issue with [the change],” said Maya Borenstein, a graduate student studying social work. “The title of my courses doesn’t really affect me. I’m all for changing language if it’s what they think is correct.”
Borenstein said she doesn’t feel like the change is limiting her own speech. David Lerman, another graduate student studying social work, said he thinks it isn’t his place to judge whether a term is harmful or offensive because he’s white.
“Coming from a background where I had family members that grew up working fields, I don’t think that they themselves would find it particularly offensive,” said Rylan Jimenez, a freshman majoring in engineering. “It just seems a little ridiculous to me.”
Jimenez said he can’t speak for people whose families have been through slavery.
“I feel like I can see both sides of the argument,” said Rozheen Barekatein, a graduate student studying social work. “But at the same time, why are we calling it a ‘master’s program?’”
Correction: This article was updated at 4:10 p.m. on Jan. 11 to reflect that the Office of Practicum Education did not put out a press release about the language change, but rather a memo. The words “change” and “among students, community” were also added to the headline to clarify the nature of the development. The story was also updated to include a statement from Interim Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Graddy and to clarify that the change only took place in the Office of Practicum Education. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

When I learn the birth charts of people I already know well, I’m never surprised. I easily, and possibly problematically, lump them into categories. My party animal friends have Sagittarius risings, and my ambitious and driven friends have Aries Moons. When I click with someone instantly they almost always have a Taurus placement, as it’s my Scorpio Sun’s complementary sign and a match to my Taurus Moon. 
Thus, finding out the astrology placements of my favorite music artists is no different. Music is the ultimate gateway into a parasocial relationship. I’ve never had a conversation with Taylor Swift, but through her discography alone, I know (probably too much) about her deepest insecurities, familial relationships and romantic woes. With 10 albums (12 including her re-records), Swifties have a pretty good grasp on many aspects of her life. 
So when I did a deep dive into Swift’s chart and the charts of my other top Spotify artists of 2022, I wasn’t at all surprised by what I found.
Taylor Swift
While I could write a whole column on its own about Swift’s astrology, “Run” off of 2021’s “Red (Taylor’s Version)” perfectly encapsulates her Sagittarius Sun. Sagittarians are known for their spontaneity and desire to travel as a means of escaping their current situation: “And run,  / like you’d run from the law / Darling, let’s run / Run from it all / We can go like they’re trying to chase us / Go where no one else is / run,” Swift and featured artist Ed Sheeran sing. 
Swift’s Scorpio rising allowed her to pull off the edgy, rebellious energy of her Reputation era flawlessly. It’s kind of metaphorical, being that your rising sign is often people’s first impression of you. Characterized by the intimidating, mysterious scorpion, of course people would assume she was in the wrong during the whole Kimye fiasco. 
The placement that made the most sense to me after reading her chart was her Capricorn Mercury. As Earth signs, Capricorns are methodical, grounded and hardworking. This placement comes through in what she dubs her “fountain pen” lyrics. Bridges that feel more like prose in her 2020 release “evermore” come to mind, such as in the album’s title track: “And I was catching my breath / Barefoot in the wildest winter / Catching my death / And I couldn’t be sure / I had a feeling so peculiar / That this pain would be for / Evermore.”
Noah Kahan
It’s extremely typical of an Earth sign to write an entire album about their hometown. Kahan’s junior album “Stick Season,” released Oct. 2022, pays homage to his birthplace of Strafford, Vermont. Having heavy Earth placements in his Capricorn Sun, Capricorn Mercury and Virgo Mars, he captures the element’s groundedness and stability by exploring his resentment for having these emotions. In his song “Homesick,” he turns the popular term on its head by explaining that he is sick of home instead of sick for home. In “Growing Sideways,” he explains that he’s giving into his depression and is simply going through the motions of his day-to-day life, something he resents his parents for passing onto him. “But I ignore things,  and I move sideways / till I forget what I felt in the first place / at the end of the day I know there are worse ways to stay alive,” he sings. 
One of the weird things about learning the astrology of artists after you know their music is that you can make sense of the more emotion-based placements before others. When meeting people in person, their rising sign can be immediately apparent, while their Moon sign may take more time to figure out. With Kahan, his Earth placements were incredibly clear to me, but I would have never known he has an Aries rising from the contents of his music. Having seen him live, however, Kahan’s rising comes through with his unexpected fiery persona.
Maisie Peters
With all of her Gemini placements, it makes sense that Peters is the queen of unhinged. In her “Psycho” music video, she assembles an army of her cheating boyfriend’s exes and current girlfriends to dress exactly like her and get back at him. Total Gemini behavior. 
After dying her hair from brown to platinum blonde, she released a song about it, fittingly titled “Blonde.” “Kinda like your worst nightmare but double / Is that an angel? No, it’s your ex / Remember how you screwed up when I was a brunette? / I don’t think you knew just what you’d done / Woah, I’ll fuck your life up as a blonde,” Peters sings. Both the lyrics and music are confidently chaotic, the trademark of any Gemini. 
Her Pisces Moon, however, shows her creative and sentimental side. In one of her first singles, “Best I’ll Ever Sing,” she compares her past relationship to her songwriting portfolio: “Maybe we brought out the worst in each other / A million full stops on our skin / But baby the songs that I wrote as your other / Are the best I’ll ever sing.” Although most of her recent songs have been more like “Blonde,” she isn’t afraid to show her Pisces Moon every now and then.
Lizzy McAlpine 
McAlpine’s ability to describe her daydreams in such detail that it convinces the listener of its reality is such a Libra Mercury quality. Particularly in the song “ceilings” off of her sophomore album “five seconds flat,” she describes a beautiful and simple romance with lines like, “Lovely to be sitting here with you” and “it feels like the start of a movie I’ve seen before.” Then, at the climax of the track, she hits the listener with, “but it’s not real / and you don’t exist / and I can’t recall the last time I was kissed.” Libra Mercuries, in particular, are very good at recognizing and communicating all sides of a situation, something McAlpine does effortlessly in many of her songs. 
“Means Something” off of her debut album “Give Me a Minute” combines McAlpine’s daydreaming tendencies with her observant Aquarius Moon. Throughout the song, she mentions various “signs” she sees that she takes to mean her and the person she’s singing about should be together. Something as simple as seeing their name on a street sign or (fittingly) their zodiac sign being a Leo means they are destined to be together.

Fútbol Club Barcelona long held an identity fortified in accolades and driven by soccer icon Lionel Messi. For years, Barça dominated La Liga and brought immense pride to its fanbase. However, just as there was a Barça before Messi, there is now a Barça after Messi. Following his departure, FC Barcelona as a club, or rather dynasty, came crashing down. 
Filming began in 2020 and documented club life for two years. On Dec. 28, Amazon Prime released a docuseries. The docuseries, “FC Barcelona: A New Era,” followed the aftermath of his departure, the club’s rebuilding phase and the current status of the team. 
Anyone familiar with European soccer knows that the “Messi” name quickly became synonymous with the club itself. While Messi was arguably the beating heart of Barça, this series set out to tell the story of the new generation of players. 
Despite the intention to exhibit the future of Barça, the story quickly became overshadowed by the legacy of the past. Messi held the spot as the most notable player on the field for 17 seasons. His name and ability was the foundation the club was built upon. However, the show dwelled far too long on the hole Messi left, which served as nothing more than a hindrance to the portrayal of the current team. 
The first two episodes of an only five-episode series follow coaches strategizing on how to re-sign the soccer phenom and the growing anticipation of his final decision. The second episode ultimately culminated in the emotional press conference where Messi announced his departure. By reflecting too much on the history, the series distracted the audience from the athletic prowess of the current team. Every mention of Messi oversaturated the portrayal of the current team with the reputation of the former team. A show which set out to tell the story of the “New Era” of the club should not have gone down the dead-end path of retelling the same story a hundred times. To a certain extent, “FC Barcelona: A New Era” hid the team in the shadows of its past players. 
The revolving door of club presidents and coaches, including the arrival of current coach Xavi Hernández, was an alluring dynamic in the show. The intricacies and heavy turnover of Barça leadership portrayed in the first few episodes is the backbone of reconstruction that entices viewers to keep watching. Hernández, a former Barça icon whose role on the field was reimagined to one on the sidelines, helped tides turn in the success of the team and the storytelling of the docuseries. 
Despite being a former player, Hernández helped the team pave their own path away from the overbearing legacy of the past. The show’s juxtaposition between the coaches who tried to adopt Barça principles and Hernández who already had these ideals ingrained in him, gave this aspect of the rebuilding process historical depth. 
Another strength of the show was including the camaraderie of players and listening to their behind-the-scenes perspectives. As much as the sudden drop in league standings had an effect on the players physically, there was also a significant mental toll. Player interviews throughout the docuseries highlighted the emotional side of soccer, offering a layer of identity to the Barça name. As new players were introduced, viewers saw the identity of the club begin to evolve into a new being — separate from just the impact of Messi. 
The only problem was that these new players were introduced far too late in the series. Not until the final two episodes did the door fully close on past players and the spotlight was shown on up-and-coming players such as Pedro González López, or “Pedri,” and Pablo Martín Páez Gavira, or “Gavi.” Gavi and Pedri are a declaration of future Barça success, yet their role on the show was primarily constrained to the final two episodes. 
So much of Barça’s journey was lost because the audience was only focused on the end goal: a return to the greatness that once was unstoppable. It was not until the final episodes that acknowledged this elusive former glory can only be recaptured through new puzzle pieces. “FC Barcelona: A New Era’’ makes it clear that Gavi and Pedri are not the first players since Messi to make a positive impact on the field, but they are credited with retrieving the faith in the team that was once so abundant. The biggest mistake of “FC Barcelona: A New Era’’ was framing the new era as “who will fill Messi’s shoes?” when the question all along should have been “who is a part of this new era and what will they accomplish?”

Campus is once again bustling after the return of tens of thousands of students for the spring semester. Four months of classes, clubs, jobs and hopefully a lot of fun await Trojans. Still, the return, especially the first week, can be hard.
For some people, school is the greatest place to be — always busy, always social. However, if you find yourself with the all-too-familiar pit in your stomach reminding you that you have to wake up at 8 a.m. and interact with a whole group of new classmates rather than just stay in your pajamas and bother your mom for the day, sometimes a few exciting upcoming releases can provide some comfort that the semester is indeed survivable. 
Between long-awaited albums and exciting debut novels, this semester is expected to be one of nonstop excitement. 
Albums:
“Five Easy Hot Dogs” by Mac DeMarco — Jan. 20
After rumors of retirement, Mac DeMarco is back. The indie-rock artist, known for the hit songs “My Kind of Woman” and “Chamber of Reflection,” announced a new album, “Five Easy Hot Dogs,” last week.  
DeMarco recorded the album during a winding road trip he took from Los Angeles to Utah. Spanning from Gualala, California to Vancouver, British Columbia, each track is named after the city in which it was created. The largely instrumental album explores his experiences in each city. Clunk Magazine described the album as “gonzo music,” referring to journalist’s Hunter S. Thompson’s humorous and personal approach to storytelling.  
“Raven” by Kelela — Feb. 10
R&B and electronic artist Kelela Mizanekristos, who creates music under her first name, is finally dropping an album after a five-year hiatus. “Raven” comes after Kelela’s critically-acclaimed debut album “Take Me Apart.”
Kelela describes her new album as “an affirmation of black femme perspective in the midst of systemic erasure and the sound of our vulnerability turned to power.” She is hoping to show dance and club music as an important Black art form. 
Singles such as “On The Run” promise the club production she is known for while continuing to push the boundaries of R&B music. 
Books:
“The Shards” by Bret Easton Ellis — Jan. 17 
With “The Shards,” the author of “American Psycho” returns to writing after a 13-year break. 
“The Shards” is another serial killer story, this time following a group of extremely privileged preparatory high school kids in Los Angeles. Narrator Bret and his friends begin to draw the attention of the killer on the loose. Bret as a character is kind of the worst, being unlikable and pretentious, but that’s what makes Ellis’ writing so captivating. Reality begins to distort in Bret’s mind, keeping the reader drawn in with a classic unreliable narrator. 
“Your Driver Is Waiting” by Priya Guns — Feb. 28
Debut author Priya Guns reinvents the world of “Taxi Driver” (1976) in “Your Driver Is Waiting.” A hilarious and dark satire, the novel follows a rideshare driver, Damani, who is a queer woman of color, as she enters a relationship with one of her passengers, a rich white woman. 
Through turmoil in both their relationship and the world around them, Guns questions the allyship of white activists. Guns’ novel is the perfect book to add to your want to read list. 
Television:
“Poker Face” — Jan. 26 – March 9
Starring Natasha Lyonne of “But I’m a Cheerleader” and “Orange is the New Black,” “Poker Face” is a mystery series from “Knives Out” creator Rian Johnson set to release on Peacock. 
Charlie Cale (Lyonne) has the ability to tell when people are lying. Each of 10 episodes is an individual mystery that Cale attempts to solve. The cast includes a-listers such as Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days of Summer) and Adrien Brody (The Pianist).
With Johnson’s clear knack for entertaining and satisfying mysteries, great things are expected to come from this series.     
“Truth Be Told” Season Three — Jan. 20 – March 24
Octavia Spencer (Hidden Figures) returns as Poppy Scoville-Parnell for season three of Apple TV+’s drama series “Truth Be Told.” Scoville is a true crime podcaster who investigates and solves the crimes she podcasts about. It’s like “Only Murders in the Building” but much more serious. 
As “Truth Be Told” is an anthology series, the show investigates a new crime each season. According to Variety, this season sees Scoville tracking a sex trafficking ring with the help of a school principal played by Gabrielle Union (Bring It On). 
Spring semester is in no way lacking exciting releases, with many more sure to be announced in the coming months. Plus with shows, movies, art and music being created on campus, there is no shortage of excitement and entertainment.

In what will likely go down in history as one of the greatest ever team performances in a playoff game, the Georgia Bulldogs destroyed the TCU Horned Frogs 65-7 in the College Football Playoff National Championship at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium. 
The win completed Georgia’s undefeated season, crowned them back-to-back national champions and established Georgia Head Coach Kirby Smart’s program as being in a class of its own. 
“It seems like for the past three or four months, we’ve been looking to see if somebody could beat us and we just ran out of games. Nobody could,” said Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett. 
For TCU, making the national title game after being unranked to start the season was an incredible run for their program, but they felt the loss showed they still have a long way to go before they can be considered an elite program. 
“Obviously, you’ve got to give Georgia a ton of credit,” said TCU Head Coach Sonny Dykes in a postgame press conference. “They showed what kind of football program they have, and they’ve got some players over there that are pretty special. We didn’t do a great job of getting our guys prepared.” 
The 58-point margin of victory set many college football records. It was the biggest win against an AP top-three team ever and was the largest margin of victory in FBS bowl history. In addition, Georgia’s 65 points were the most ever in a national championship game. 
The Bulldogs were able to dominate in all facets of the game, leaving TCU completely overmatched. 
On their first drive of the game, Georgia marched down the field in under three minutes and scored a touchdown. 
On the other side of the ball, they shut down TCU’s ensuing drive by forcing a fumble and cashed in on the turnover with a field goal. 
This is how much of the game went. When Georgia had the ball, they completely dispatched the TCU defense and scored with little resistance. When TCU had the ball, the Bulldogs shut down every single chance that TCU had to get back in the game. 
TCU did go on one impressive drive that ended in a trademark touchdown run by quarterback Max Duggan, cutting the lead to 10-7 and making the game momentarily close. 
The Bulldogs then outscored the Horned Frogs 55-0 for the rest of the game. They took every opportunity to pile on while giving the Horned Frogs almost no opportunity to respond.
On offense, they scored five rushing touchdowns and four passing TDs. Bulldog quarterback Stetson Bennett accounted for six of those nine TDs, earning national championship game offensive MVP honors.  
“What [Bennett] did tonight was truly amazing,” said Georgia Head Coach Kirby Smart. “He probably had his best game of his career in my opinion, with some of the checks he made, some of the decisions he made. Just really elite.”
On defense, the Bulldogs picked Duggan off twice and sacked him five times. They held TCU to a measly nine first downs and only 188 total yards. Defensive back Javon Bullard accounted for both interceptions and a fumble recovery, earning him the national championship game defensive MVP award. 
“As a kid, you always dream of moments like this,” Bullard said. “To see those moments and accomplishments come true, it’s just a surreal feeling. I’m extremely blessed to be in the position that I am and I just thank God for it every day.”
They put it all together for a second consecutive national championship, the first time a team had won back-to-back titles in the College Football Playoff era. Not even their Southeastern Conference rival Alabama has done that since the CFP was created. 
Smart credited his team’s ability to run it back to their determination. 
“They had a will to work, they didn’t listen to what everybody said about them … and every time they got doubted, they came out fighting,” Smart said. 
With a 15-0 record and the biggest championship game victory ever, Georgia established themselves as the class of college football in 2022 and the team to beat in college football for years to come.

I can’t help but anticipate inevitable comments from older family members about cellphones every time I visit home for the holidays. It seems like everybody’s grandparents have something negative to say about Instagram, Snapchat or phones in general, and though I do agree that excessive social media use has contributed a large amount to the stress that young people experience, I believe that academic and work-related apps play an often unrecognized role in complicating our lives.
I never used to check the weekly phone reports that my settings app generated. I always expected to see poor results indicating my extensive time on Instagram and TikTok, and I knew that reading these reports would only lead to disappointment. So, with the mindset that ignorance is bliss, I never opened them — until recently.
To my surprise, I spent less time using social media than some of the other apps on my phone, such as Google, Mail and Slack. This prompted me to reflect on the stressors in my life, and although I knew that social media played a role, I realized that the constant presence of school and work outside of normal operating hours was the true culprit behind my additional digital stress. I was responding to emails late into the night, obsessively checking my Blackboard app and reading Slack messages long after meetings had ended. Rather than driving a wedge between my personal and professional time, my phone caused the two to become integrated.
The growing abundance of productivity-centric apps is problematic because it breaks down the wall that is supposed to separate our school and work lives from our personal time. By breaking down this wall, we are becoming more and more interconnected, which is not always a bad thing. However, in this case, it leads to more consistently present stress and less opportunities for breaks. 
According to Business News Daily, “research has shown that expecting employees to answer emails after hours can be detrimental. Instead of improving efficiency, after-hours emails hurt job performance.” As the article continues to detail, after-hours communication is infringing on work-life balance in the digital age.
Professors and employers may not require people to engage in after-hours communication, but I have still found myself doing it without realizing the damage it does to my mental health. Constantly revisiting my work has left me on edge and caused burnout, which has hurt my focus in the classroom setting. Additionally, researchers Janna Andersonn and Lee Rainie from the Pew Research Center note the fact that merging work and personal life onto one device never gives us the chance to fully disengage from our work. They mention that this causes heightened feelings of stress in students and employees while increasing the risk of burnout. 
In order to avoid these feelings and ensure that we are taking steps to prevent burnout, students must remain conscious about how and where they are spending their time online. Setting boundaries for ourselves can help ease this phenomenon; for example, students should try dedicating a certain amount of time to homework and professional communication before proceeding to disengage at a set time. 
Disengagement from work and school will hopefully allow students to achieve healthier relationships with their devices and allow them to find better balance between school and life. Balance is key, and in order to break the cycle of hyperactivity on our devices, we must realize our technological concerns and learn from them.
Acknowledging this cycle is important, and as students, it’s essential that we take steps to rebuild the wall between our personal and school lives. By separating the two, we can not only make our time in the classroom more productive, but we can also increase the quality of our lives outside of school.

When I was little, I decided to try and get into coding. Bad idea. Not only was I unsuccessful, I also flooded my Google Drive with hundreds of copies of a document containing just two words: “hello, world!”
Like managing a tsunami of cheery greetings in Drive, college (especially your first semester) can be overwhelming, daunting and chaotic. Luckily, I already went through it as a fall admit, so you don’t have to.
1. UCLA has better food than USC.
As Chris Martin once sang, “When you try your best but you don’t succeed…” I know it. Your professors know it. You don’t know it yet, but you will soon. Do yourself a favor, go to H Mart and create a stockpile of Asian snacks and essentials in your dorm that would make Doomsday conspiracists proud. I recommend starting with microwavable rice, Shin Ramyun, Pocky, banana milk and Ramune. 
2. APASA (Asian Pacific American Student Assembly) and APASS (Asian Pacific American Student Services) are your friends.
The organizations are great. Their newsletters are something else. From the Night Market to learning about and joining ethnic orgs like KASA, there’s no source I’d thank more for a great freshman experience than their newsletters. 
3. The Farmers Market is a godsend.
Every Wednesday, a staple as iconic as Carol Folt herself graces the McCarthy Quad. Featuring everything from Thai tea to bulgogi kimbap to the best dolmas and kalamata olives you’ll ever have outside of Greece, you don’t want to miss it (you won’t if you’re on campus).
4. Frequent the West Jefferson and Hoover crosswalk.
There tends to be a lot of foot traffic here, so adjacent from Rock and Reilly’s is typically where clubs, orgs and companies will set up tents to advertise various events, programs and offers. Save the keep-walking-with-no-eye-contact technique for the girl scouts that haggle your neighborhood in the summer. Here, if you’re strategic, you can collect quite the stash of free Insomnia cookies, Chick-fil-A sandwiches, shirts, drinks, trinkets and other food items. Free food!
5. Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
You have 2 swipes per week. Guard them with your life.
6. Leavey is open 24 hours.
Remember this. It’ll come in handy.
7. There’s this thing that happens in LA called “rain.”
Just like Texas with their annual snowstorm, California apparently forgets that rain is something weather can do. This may be sunny “Californ-i-a,” (“Surfin’,” The Beach Boys) but you’ll still need your raincoat and handy-dandy umbrella. Unless you’re into looking like a drenched rat. Then, by all means, go ahead.
8. Seek and ye shall find.
Don’t blame RMP (Rate My Professors) for your poor performance in class… If you’re struggling, SC has resources you can exhaust. From peer tutoring to office hours and more, support is available in more formats than you’d think. A simple Google or Reddit search will give you answers to all (or well most) that your heart desires.
9. No, you’re probably not making that 8 a.m.
Don’t take classes with hopes you’ll correct your sleep schedule and tardiness. Ideally, you would attend the class, take excellent notes, earn an A and leave pumped and ready to take on the day. Worst case, you could oversleep, miss class, skip class, be late to class, be in class but fall asleep, take unintelligible notes, do poorly or not remember anything at all. Take it from a vet, that’s a rookie *** mistake. Unless you are a natural born early bird, don’t take the risk.
10. No, it’s not Black Friday, that’s just the line to get into Lyon Center.
New year, new me, new Gymshark gear you can’t wear because the Lyon Center is full. But don’t worry, wait 1-2 weeks, and most people will clear out. In the meantime, may I suggest running around the Village? Running from your problems also works quite well.
Last but not least, my most important piece of advice, ever. It’s so valuable, it’s only available once a semester. Ahem. Join Daily Trojan. From photographers to Opinion writers and copy editors, we’re always looking for bright minds and passionate people to elevate the DT experience to the next level. 
You’re gonna be great.
I promise.
Fighting!

Men’s Basketball
The Trojans have a clear identity as a hard-nosed suffocating defense. Their offense is slowly catching up to the level of their strong defensive unit, but USC ranks in the middle of the Pac-12 in points per game. USC is coming off a rough two-point loss to the rival Bruins in which they erased an 18-point half-time deficit only to let the lead slip away in the final seconds. They’ll continue with their Pac-12 schedule as they host both the University of Colorado Thursday and the University of Utah Saturday to round out the week.
Women’s Basketball
After starting the season 109-0, the Trojans have lost four of their past six games and have only one conference win. Their most recent loss came by a singular point against UCLA after blowing a 12-point lead going into the fourth quarter. The Pac-12 conference is strong this season, boasting four teams ranked in the top 15. The Trojans will have their work cut out for them if they hope to make the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2014.
Men’s Swimming and Diving
The men’s swimming and diving team has had three meets this season and one already this calendar year. In their last competition, they took down UNLV with a collective win of 143-111. They get right back to the action this weekend as they go head-to-head with UC San Diego and Denver at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Women’s Swimming and Diving
The Trojans have an important diving competition coming up this weekend against the cross-town rival Bruins. USC will take part in the Bruin Diving Invitational from Friday until Sunday. The team has started with a 4-0 record on the season, including three wins against conference opponents. Postseason play is not far away, as the Pac-12 championships take place in late February, where the Trojans hope to win their first Pac-12 title since 2016.
Track & Field
USC has its first indoor meet of the season this weekend as the team heads to Spokane to take part in the Cougar Classic. The Trojans took a step back last year, placing 12th for men and 30th for women after finishing first in the entire NCAA for women and fifth for men in 2021 the season before. The indoor season will last until mid-March, and by the end of March USC will kick off its outdoor season with the Aztec Invitational in San Diego.
Men’s Volleyball
The six-time national champions are coming off a year in which they failed to make the NCAA tournament after losing to Pepperdine in the MPSF conference tournament finals. They’ll aim to bounce back this season, which is already underway for the Trojans. The Trojans are currently 2-1 after dropping their opening match to No. 7 UC Santa Barbara. The next action they’ll see will be in Long Beach, where USC will take on Lindenwood University on Friday and King College on Saturday. 
Beach Volleyball
Last year, the Trojans won their second straight NCAA championship and lost just one game the entire season. Competition doesn’t start until the end of February, but the defending champs will be ready for the start of the season with six returning seniors or graduate students. They face Grand Canyon and Long Beach State to kick off their season before going up against Cal, Stanford, Washington and UCLA over the course of just two days.
Women’s Water Polo
The Trojans are coming off yet another NCAA tournament final appearance, where they lost 7-10 to Stanford. The team was able to retain many of their leading players from last season, including redshirt junior two-meter All-MPSF First Team member Tilly Kearns. Kearns, along with the other upperclassmen on the team, will have the chance to lead USC to their third title in the last six seasons.
Men’s Tennis 
After an up-and-down individual season, the team season is about to get underway for men’s tennis. The Trojans have reached 23 wins in back-to-back years and will try to build on that this season. USC boasts the preseason No. 1 senior in the country, Stefan Dostanic, and has their first tournament of the spring season this weekend at the Sherwood Cup.
Women’s Tennis
The women’s tennis team has already gotten started with their play for the new year, as they just wrapped up play at the Hawaii Invitational. The Trojans won 16 total matches across the span of the tournament and will use this as a springboard for their season. They next hit the court against Loyola Marymount, CSUN, University of San Diego and San Diego State in a span of two days later this month.
Men’s Golf
Men’s golf was last in action at the Cal Poly Invitational, where they captured eighth-place at the tournament. The Trojans will look to improve on their play from the fall season and start off strong when they head to Westlake Village, where they’ll take part in the Southwestern Invitational. The golf team will have a chance to jump up from their current place of 67 in the rankings.
Women’s Golf
The Trojans’ first action in women’s golf this semester won’t happen until next month, but it will be for the Battle of the Bell against UCLA when they finally tee off. They’ll head to Thousand Oaks to take on the Bruins in back-to-back days and then head to Bakersfield four days later to face CSU Bakersfield. The Trojans will look to repeat as NCAA regional champions this season.
Lacrosse
Lacrosse’s season doesn’t start for a month, but they’ll need to come out of the gates sprinting. They kick off the season against Boston College, the No. 2 team in the entire country. Then, just a little more than a week later, they will host No. 23 Ohio State. The Trojans, who exited the NCAA tournament in the first round last year, begin their season Feb. 11 against the Eagles.
Rowing
The last time the Trojans hit the water for rowing, they faced off against LMU in a scrimmage in preparation for the spring. They look to be ready for their first competition of the spring season when they head to the Port of Los Angeles to take on UCLA in the notorious UCLA Dual. The Trojans will look to secure their 13th all-time appearance at the NCAA championships this season after getting there last year for the first time in four years.
Baseball
The Trojans haven’t had much success in the past few years but look to get their first winning season in a full year since 2015. A year ago, USC won only eight games out of 30 against conference opponents. Winning those conference games will set them up for success in possible postseason play.
