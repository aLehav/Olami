Senators Arie Abija and Diego Andrades introduced a senate resolution in support of Ukrainian students at Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government meeting, asking that USC and USG stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian student community to provide them with tangible and coordinated support and resources.
In the resolution, Abija and Andrades ask for support and accommodations, including extending virtual accommodations, extending the Pass/No Pass deadline through May 20, and increasing the Pass/No Pass threshold to 32 units. 
They also call for USC Financial Services to waive late fees and extend payment deadlines, the Engemann Student Health Center to provide expedited mental health services and for the University to release another public statement in support of the Ukrainian student community. 
“We knew that something tangible needed to happen,” Abija said. “So, we started looking at the comments of Instagram posts and reached out to those students to just ask what they needed.” 
USG also approved a funding proposal for the ROTC Aviation Career Opportunity and a senate resolution to make election day a non-instructional day. 
At the start of the meeting, chief financial officer Adenike Makinde gave funding updates, stating that the Green Engagement Fund is being used for three groups — Trojan Charge, The Great South Central Sale and USC Gardening Club — for their end-of-the-year projects. The social innovation fund will also be used in collaboration with Tilt, a project incubator program that will provide space to encourage youth to start their projects, and Leda Health to provide resources and healing circles for sexual assault survivors. 
Speaker of the senate Tommy Nguyen also shared his projects including the incorporations of the Middle Eastern North African Student Association and Military Associated Student Association, and creating resolutions for VoteSC, Support for Ukraine, OT100, Commuter Hub and Faculty Salary Raises to Cost of Living. 
Nguyen said there was an excess of $30,526 in executive and legislative funding, which the branches are slowly spending through funding proposals such as SuitUp SC, a project to provide free business attire for 50 students that demonstrate financial need, and Art Therapy, an event to create a community for sexual assault survivors.
“We’re looking forward to zeroing out that budget for this year,” Nguyen said. “I’m very excited about funding projects.”
VoteSC introduced a senate resolution at last week’s meeting to have Election Day be a non-instructional day for federal elections. The organization believes that the implementation of the holiday will allow USC to become a voter-friendly campus that encourages voter turnout and civic engagement among the student body.
“Voting should be a celebration, not a chore,” VoteSC vice president Hannah Franco said.
VoteSC is working in partnership with Unruh Associates, Trojan Democrats and Political Student Assembly. They look to also begin working in collaboration with cultural student assemblies and USC GOP.
The resolution was unanimously approved. 
Senator Brian Stowe introduced a new funding proposal at last week’s meeting, asking for $7,500 for the ROTC Aviation Career Opportunity to fund five $1,500 scholarships to provide five to seven flight hours for students to be competitive candidates to become pilots, allowing them to move into the second bracket when applying. 
To qualify, students must be cadets demonstrating a strong desire to fly, have zero flying hours, demonstrate financial need and have an aptitude to fly. Selected students will receive this funding as credit at Pacific Skies Aviation to complete instruction with a certified instructor. 
“It’s extremely important that people have the opportunity to at least build some flight time before and when they’re in the Air Force ROTC program,” Stowe said. “There’s a lack of accessibility to it, so if we can do anything that we can to enhance the accessibility to that, I think it’s an extremely good opportunity that we need to take.”
The funding proposal was approved unanimously. 
“I’m very happy that it was approved, very happy for the support that we got from the other senators,” Stowe said. “It will be a one-time opportunity, [but] ideally, there’ll be a future partnership between the University and the Air Force ROTC program to fund opportunities like this every year.”
Andrades also introduced a $3,500 funding proposal out of the legislative fund to pilot a program to provide 3,500 fentanyl test strips and distribute them in collaboration with Trojan Awareness Combating Overdose, a registered student organization and 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to preventing drug overdose-related deaths. 
“There is a need for drug safety measures in our community,” Andrades said. “Since TACO was founded, there haven’t been [overdose-related] deaths. While TACO might not be the direct cause of this decrease … there have been a lot of students using their resources.”  
This funding proposal and the resolution to support Ukrainian students will be voted on at the next senate meeting.

USC Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale, Calif. ratified a contract Thursday, effective immediately, with the California Nurses Association. The CNA represents the hospital’s more than 300 registered nurses.
The agreement comes after RNs employed at the hospital held an informational picket and car caravan Feb. 23, for understaffing and inadequate coronavirus protection. More than 90 RNs across various hospital departments used their work breaks to participate in the picket. 
USC-VHH has seen a 40% turnover rate since 2019. One of the chief concerns for participating RNs was the shortage of nurses willing to risk their license by working in conditions that may have put them in contact with coronavirus-positive patients in hospital hallways. As a result of short-staffed departments, several units were taking in and rooming patients from other units, which placed additional pressure on workers.
After contract negotiations paused abruptly at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, nurses signed a two-year contract. As the contract neared its end, nurses demonstrated their demands in hopes of establishing a new contract that would retain and recruit experienced nurses. Negotiations for the new contract, a union representative said, began again last December.
“The past two years have been especially challenging, and our registered nurses have responded with compassion, skill and resilience,” said Chief Nursing Officer Theresa Murphy in a Friday press release from Keck Medicine of USC.
The new contract includes safer floating practices, annual wage increases, a new infectious disease task force and safer practices for coronavirus patients, including negative pressure rooms and additional personal protective equipment. 
“As we enter year three of the pandemic, this new contract will help keep everyone in our hospital safe and healthy,” said Esther Hathaway, an ICU nurse at Verdugo Hills Hospital, in a CNA/NNU press release Friday. “Some of the key wins we fought for will make our hospital a better place to work for nurses, which will make it a better place for patients, too.”
The contract will be in place through Dec. 31, 2024. 
“We fought for these wins,” said emergency department RN Lisa Harris in the CNA/NNU press release. “We showed management that we’re united with one voice, that we’re done with risking our licenses, and that we’re done risking patient safety.”

As Spring Break approaches, USC Student Health recommends students take extra safety precautions, such as researching coronavirus case levels in the places they travel to, getting tested — preferably using PCR tests — before visiting vulnerable friends and family and staying up to date on vaccines.
“At this point, given the change of where we are with COVID with the dropping rates, it’s really about knowing your individual risk, [knowing] the risk of where you’re going … and then getting prepared to be tested before and after travel,” said Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman at a student media health briefing Tuesday.
The University encourages all students to test within 24 hours of returning to campus, Van Orman said. Students who test positive must inform the University, then take a PCR test and isolate.
Additionally, Van Orman recommends that all students wear N95 masks — available on campus to students at no cost — when traveling or in large crowds. 
Approximately 82% of students are currently fully vaccinated and boosted, Van Orman said. Student Health wishes to see this rate increase and continues to encourage eligible students to get boosted.
“Our data from the beginning part of this semester showed that not being boosted is a risk factor for becoming infected, so we really encourage people to get their boosters,” Van Orman said. 
Students who are not boosted must test prior to accessing campus. USC’s COVID-19 Dashboard, which displays current positivity rates among students and employees, will continue to be updated, although percent positivity will not reflect case numbers across the community holistically as weekly surveillance testing is no longer required for boosted students.
“The people that are testing are going to … because they have symptoms or have been exposed,” Van Orman said. “So our percent positivity may increase even though our total number of cases doesn’t increase.”
Despite changes in testing requirements, the current positivity rate remains low, with last week’s student positivity rate being less than 0.5%. 
“​​We’re seeing very few cases right now, which is consistent with what we’re seeing within the rest of [Los Angeles] County,” Van Orman said. “Cases are very low right now on campus — the lowest they’ve been in several months.”
The University is now aligned with L.A. County’s masking policies, as students are no longer required to wear masks in most indoor settings — including classrooms, offices and residential dining facilities. Although masks are no longer required, they are still highly recommended, Van Orman said. 
“I’m really stressing to everybody is that masks are still highly recommended,” Van Orman said. “We will still provide masks; it’s really important that people feel comfortable wearing masks.”
Teachers are not allowed to individually require that students wear masks to their class, Van Orman said.
“It’s really kind of an equity thing because, for example, our workers in the [Recreational Center] or the cafeteria or other places couldn’t ask people around them to wear masks, so really, we want to be fair across campus,” Van Orman said.
Despite the mask mandate lifting and the removal of weekly surveillance testing, Van Orman said Student Health continues to closely monitor the well being and safety of students on campus. Individuals who aren’t fully vaccinated will continue to test and have their positivity rates monitored, which she said is a good indicator of rising coronavirus levels in the community. Additionally, the school does wastewater testing on water leaving campus residences to screen for the virus.
As testing levels decrease, some coronavirus testing sites will close, Van Orman said. The bookstore location has shut down and the Pardee Marks location will close over Spring Break. Employees working at these locations are all regular Student Health employees and will handle other responsibilities, she said. 
“We’re really watching with our peers what happens over the next few weeks, particularly because we’re on Spring Break and so making sure that we don’t have a significant increase of cases related to Spring Break,” Van Orman said. “Any decisions about any further changes will be made one, after the city and the county ordinances change, and then two … after that Spring Break period.”

Last year, Mia McCarthy and Chase Robbins, both sophomores in the Iovine and Young Academy, were sitting around at 11 p.m. when they started craving candy. 
The pair immediately ordered DoorDash to settle the sweet tooth. After carefully tracking the driver for an agonizing 45 minutes, the driver canceled. This moment made them realize there had to be a quicker way for customers to order snacks without having to drive to the grocery store. 
McCarthy and Robbins then started their newest entrepreneurial endeavor: Handle, a service that delivers snacks, drinks, ice cream and household necessities to your door in under 15 minutes. 
“It’s been really wild to see something that [we] just thought of one day actually come to fruition and see the people working for us and see our happy customers,” McCarthy said. “Everything here has come from our brains, and it has been such a fulfilling experience to see this intangible thing actually become physical.”
McCarthy and Robbins spent the summer of 2021 navigating the process of starting a business. Robbins had previous experience in start-ups, and the two dove in. Every day became about speaking with realtors, searching for suppliers and understanding the logistics and engineering that comes with starting a fully functional business. 
“We were trying to push things forward so fast that we started to hate weekends because no one else was working so we couldn’t move forward with real estate or we couldn’t contact suppliers, which is something that [McCarthy], and I joke about to this day,” Robbins said.
After spending the full summer learning the ropes of running a buisness, McCarthy and Robbins acquired an assortment of suppliers to provide everything from food to condoms in preparation for Handle’s launch. The store sells a variety of chips and snacks, candies, drinks and household items from over 10 suppliers. 
The next major hurdle was figuring out what strategy made the most sense for ordering and customer convenience. In hopes of mimicking platforms like Doordash and Uber, they decided the best choice was to hire engineers to build a fully functional app. The Handle app allows the customer to scroll through all snack, drink and item options: add them to cart and order when ready.
On the night of the app’s official launch in late August, the app crashed, leaving McCarthy feeling hopeless and devastated. Despite months of effort, preparation and events hyping up the company’s launch, they had to make the difficult decision to close the store and figure out how best to address the issue.
“It was really hard, emotionally challenging and such a letdown,” McCarthy said. “I’m really glad that we were able to bounce back, but it was a really hard decision to not only close but just take the hit personally.”
Robbins had a background in engineering and spent the following 10 days coding the app from scratch so that the team could ensure success for their second launch. Mia’s artistic background, combined with Robbins’ engineering background, allowed them to work well together with their own unique skill sets.
“Mia has a really unique artistic and expressive ability about her, and I bring more of a scientific engineering side, and so when we get together and start talking, we are able to come up with a lot of ideas really quickly,” Robbins said. 
The early days of the business were nothing but difficult. McCarthy and Robbins delivered orders, worked on marketing and spoke with suppliers to improve the products the store was selling. 
“It has taken so much time, and so much energy to make this happen, and we really have poured everything we have into it,” McCarthy said.
H McCarthy and Robbins now have an entire fleet of deliverers working from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. daily, delivering thousands of products to people in the surrounding  campus community. 
Eli Safaie-Kia, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was brought on as the chief growth officer at Handle. Safaie-Kia has seen the business grow in both success and the strong sense of community among the team.
“We have been so successful in creating a Handle community of customers, employees and other stakeholders on campus that snack together, study together, party together and Handle together,” Safaie-Kia said. “This incredible community has grown, not only in size and numbers, but also in breadth and depth as our student organization and local business partnerships have flourished.”
McCarthy and Robbins’ journey  with Handle has been defined by the pressures and struggles that come with opening a new business, especially as students. Despite challenges, they are now functional, serving snacks and other necessities to the USC community.
“Emotionally, it has, at times, been super hard, but also, at the same time so unbelievably gratifying,” McCarthy said. “Just seeing the traction we’ve had has been so beautiful and so happy and fulfilling, so there have just been so many emotions, but mostly good ones.”

With a mixutre of diverse dance moves, stunning dress and melodious music, the Traditional Chinese Dance Club at USC presented its 17th annual showcase at Bovard Auditorium on March 6 — nearly 3 years since the group halted the in-person showcase due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
TCD is a USC student dance group that intends to promote Chinese culture and dance styles while inspiring others. The theme of this year’s showcase “A Flutter in Time,” featured performances of various traditional Chinese dance styles, and a one-act dance adapted from Chinese folktale and romantic tragedy “Butterfly Lovers.”
In their opening speech, co-captains Aline Wu, a senior majoring in environmental science and health and the human sciences, and Sharon Zhang, a senior majoring in communication and comparative literature, expressed their happiness to present the show to the audience. 
“We are so grateful that all of you were able to make it out tonight,” Wu said. “We are even more excited that we are able to perform in front of the live audience [at] Bovard again.”
TCD took the audience on an exquisite journey, exploring the different aspects of Chinese culture, and presenting dances and stories from ancient history and modern days. 
“Song of Purity and Peace” depicted the palace ladies of the Tang dynasty. In this performance, the dancers dressed in beautiful Tang-era clothes and swayed with traditional Chinese music. In “Unfettered,” the dancers performed dances of the Han dynasty and wore Guangxiu, elegant dresses with wide sleeves to portray youngsters who are full of vigor and high spirits.
Aside from the elegant dances of ancient China, TCD also performed lively modern dances. “Grandma’s Happy Life” is a dynamic presentation of an older dance troupe, which may remind people of square dancing, a popular activity among Chinese older adults. The dancers dressed in warm, bright red costumes and performed a very humorous scene of grandmas having a conflict who eventually decide to reconcile and dance together. 
TCD made a thoughtful selection of musical accompaniment for the performances using Chinese traditional music when performing the Han-era and Tang-era dances. The performance “Fish Among Blooming and Begonias” borrows the theme song of a Chinese animated film “Big Fish & Begonia,” connecting to the sea, nature and freedom. “The First Encounter” used the interlude of a popular Chinese TV show and love tragedy “Good Bye, My Princess” to tell lovers’ heart-wrenching feelings when remembering their first encounter.
Props considered important elements of Chinese dance, were also incorporated into TCD’s performances including different types of Chinese fans, square stools and a silk umbrella.
Sarah Kim, a junior majoring in law, history, culture, and East Asian Languages and Cultures, was “Dance of Southern Yunnan,” was her favorite.
“I just think that it would have taken a lot of work to do,” Kim said. “And I really liked the introduction where she hides her face with the umbrella because it makes it a little bit mysterious at the start.” 
Retelling “Butterfly Lovers,” choreographed by Wu, Zhang, sophomore Kailyn Xu and senior Carolyn Song, served as the showcase’s climax. In somber lights, two lovers in the story, Zhu Yingtai and Liang Shanbo, danced heartbroken by the fact that they could not be with each other. Accompanied by the “Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto,” the dancer’s lithe movements and sorrowful expressions attempted to emotionly imact the audience.   
Graduate student Leya Li played Zhu Yingtai, while freshman Jenny Guo played Liang Shanbo. Both instilled great emotion into their performance, using every one of their dance moves to convey a feeling and deliver a message to the audience. They excellently portrayed the two lovers and their strong affections for each other. Additionally, “Palace Ladies” won warm acclaim from Kim for the performances costuming.
TCD’s excellent performance left Kim with a deep impression as well. Minjee Park, a junior majoring in American Studies and Ethnicities, said she liked the clean dance movements and the performer’s dress. 
“It’s my first time seeing Chinese traditional dance, so I kind of didn’t really know that much about it,” Park said. “It was a really cool experience … The movements are so graceful and the costumes are so pretty, it was great.”
Jaden Stovall, junior majoring in creative writing and narrative studies, also appreciated the dance club’s performances.
“I think what I really appreciated though, was kind of the story blurbs that went with every single performance,” Stovall said. “I thought that was really neat.”

As midterms approach and the freedom of spring break nears, here’s everything that’s new and noteworthy to catch up on your favorite streaming services. 
Between fascinating psychological thrillers dealing with murderous vacations and deadly affairs, new Pixar animation confronting teenagehood, a soapy twist on true crime and more, there’s about everything for lovers of media to excitably consume this month. Among the highlights this month are two Academy Award Best Picture contenders which will take place near the end of March.
Netflix
“The Weekend Away” — Mar. 3
Adapted from Sarah Alderson’s 2020 novel of the same name, “The Weekend Away” is a deep psychological thriller directed by Kim Farrant. The film stars Leighton Meester as a woman accused of horrifically murdering her best friend while on vacation in Croatia. Disturbing revelations are continuously unearthed as she attempts to absolve herself of her alleged culpability. 
The film marks an exciting return to action for the beloved Leighton Meester, who has remained quiet on several fronts since her culturally revolutionary performance as Blair Waldorf in the beloved “Gossip Girl,” in addition to a little-known, yet critical, stint in pop music. “The Weekend Away” provides spring breakers something seriously hair-raising to enjoy while soaking up in the sunshine poolside.
“Bridgerton” Season 2 — Mar. 25
Take a much needed break from the salacious, yet exhausting, world of college drama and be transported back into a fictional wonderland this month. First debuting to instantaneous success in late 2020, USC alumna  Shonda Rhimes’s smash-hit period drama television series “Bridgerton” finally returns for a second season at the end of March. Currently standing as Netflix’s second-most streamed series on the platform, the show takes us back to the cutthroat world of Regency-era high society and debutantes. Only this time, the season’s focus will be on newcomer Simone Ashley’s (of “Sex Education” fame) courtship with Anthony Bridgerton. So, expect Lady Bridgerton to pop up in all of your feeds this month.
HBO Max
“Drive My Car” — Mar. 2
One of last year’s biggest awards season upsets, “Drive My Car” struggled to find significant mainstream audiences despite wide critical acclaim. 
Quietly nabbing four nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, it became the first Japanese film nominated for Best Picture. Adapted from a 2014 collection of short stories titled “Men Without Women,” Hamaguchi’s film centers on the relationship between a play director grieving the recent passing of his wife and his new driver and their increasing familiarity with one another. 
Contending with love, loss and acceptance, the film is sure to make emotional shockwaves among viewers. As if real-life wasn’t already jarring enough, this sprawling, subdued emotional epic is sure to find its home with those willing to engage with its emotional core. So, run away from the rollercoaster that is the final months of the school year to instead be transported into Hamaguchi’s world for a night. 
“West Side Story” — Mar. 2
The iconic 1957 musical of the same name has once again been adapted for the silver screen (by legendary auteur Steven Spielberg, no less) after its first film adaptation in 1961. Spielberg’s 2021 adaptation has received a whopping seven nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a celebratory Best Supporting Actress nod for the wonderful Ariana DeBose. 
In development for approximately 8 years before the release, the film remains incredibly faithful to the spirit of its predecessors in its story, characterizations and, most importantly, the late Steven Sondheim’s iconic music. The film stays true to what made “West Side Story” an artistic phenomenon both on the stage and on the screen for more than 50 years while maximizing the scope of the story for a modern-day context. 
Hulu
“The Dropout” — Mar. 3
From the creator of the super popular, long-running sitcom “New Girl,” Elizabeth Meriwether, comes a new miniseries based on the 2019 podcast of the same name. “The Dropout” chronicles the trajectory of notorious biotech entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes and her doomed health technology company Theranos. 
Starring Amanda Seyfried as Holmes, the series rolled out the first three episodes upon release and is expected to release new episodes weekly through early April. The show not only serves as another gripping showcase of Seyfried’s incredible talent, it is a valid case study for why we shouldn’t drop out of college, but provides a fascinating dramatization of one of our century’s biggest media frenzies yet.
“Deep Water” — Mar. 18
Adapted from the 1957 novel of the same name, “Deep Water” is a psychological thriller directed by Adrian Lyne and written by Zach Helm and “Euphoria” showrunner Sam Levinson. Starring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas as a couple whose marriage is failing, the mind games they play with each other begin to have fatal consequences on those around them. In development for nearly a decade, the film was originally scheduled for release in late 2020 before experiencing several delays. The film additionally sees Levinson once again teaming up with “Euphoria” star Jacob Elordi. This all-star cast in combination with “Euphoria’s” highly-coveted heartthrob and showrunner is sure to provide the thrilling spiritual successor to “Gone Girl” we’ve been craving for years.
Disney+
“Turning Red” — Mar. 11
Everyone’s favorite animation studio, Pixar, returns with a delightfully absurd coming-of-age tale about a 13-year-old girl who wakes up one morning to discover that she has turned into a gigantic red panda. The film is an impressive addition to Pixar’s large catalog, being the first film solely directed by a woman, the first film to focus on characters in Canada and the second to feature an Asian lead character. 
Domee Shi’s directorial debut, who was responsible for creating Pixar’s Academy Award-winning short “Bao” in 2018, the film has already sent ripples through film circles for its candid portrayal of girlhood and puberty. Already setting itself apart from many other films, “Turning Red” is sure to win viewers over with the incredibly heartfelt territory it’s charting alongside one of the most seemingly vibrant visual palettes of any of the company’s films.

When I told my friends and family that I was leaving Tennessee to go to school in California, I was constantly warned to be wary of traffic, earthquakes and wildfires. I would roll my eyes upon hearing these cautionary tales, doubting that my life in California would ever be significantly affected by earthquakes or fires — although, I was rather worried about the traffic. 
However, as the fall set on my freshman year, there were days I would wake up and smell something burning. I would look out of my window (shoutout seventh floor of Birnkrant) and see hazy clouds of smoke hanging in the sky. That 2019 wildfire season, which was relatively quiet compared to other years, saw over 250,000 acres of land burned and at least three fatalities. While I was fortunate that the fires weren’t affecting me in any particularly harmful ways, I certainly became aware of the dangers they impose. 
Wildfires are occurring more and more frequently. The five year average has nearly doubled since 2008, largely because of a redhot 2020 fire season which saw well over 3.5 million acres burned. 
Humans are responsible for 84% of wildfires in the United States, according to Tess Joosse, a writer at Science Magazine. While lightning strikes and dry thunderstorms cause fires, they are seasonal threats. A forgotten fire pit or sparked powerline could ignite a wildfire at any moment. 
Wildfires have a mixed effect on the environment. By heating the soil, fire triggers seed germination, leading to more vegetation for animals to consume. However, wildfires also can burn down forests that can take hundreds of years to recover. As seen in the 2020 fires in Australia, animals can fall victim to the flames, with over 3 billion animals killed or displaced as a result of these widespread fires. 
It isn’t only the environment that is suffering because of wildfires. In 2020, over 600,000 Californians were displaced from their homes, over twice as many in 2019. Wildfires are expensive, costing California taxpayers an estimated $1.3 billion since July 2021, not to mention the personal devastation they can cause. 
The pollution posed by wildfires can also affect our ability to be active outside. When I was smelling smoke in my freshman dorm, it was likely harming my lungs. The increase in air pollution that wildfires cause can lead to eye irritation or a cough, but also more serious conditions such as bronchitis and heart failure. This provides a challenge to Californians, who want to enjoy the surplus of outdoor activities that the state has to offer year-round. If you have preexisting health conditions or are (wisely) concerned about your long-term lung health, the wildfire season can take away your ability to enjoy the outdoors. 
Athletes are proven to be more at risk of inhaling smoke and pollution because more air is inhaled through the mouth while exercising. The Air Quality Index measures the amount of pollutants on a scale of one to 500. A safe AQI is considered between 50 and 100. However, the NFL and NCAA allow players to compete when the AQI is as high as 200. 
In 2018, a wildfire in Northern California known as Camp Fire caused problems for the NFL teams in the state. The San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Rams and the then Oakland Raiders all had practices shortened or canceled during the peak of the Camp Fire crisis. During the Monday Night Football game between the 49ers and New York Giants, smoke from the nearby fires clouded the 49ers’ stadium in Santa Clara. Players on the sideline could be seen wearing oxygen masks, a clear indication that the air was not safe to inhale. 
As the climate continues to heat and dry up, wildfires will increasingly occur, resulting in many more situations in which the AQI isn’t safe to hold practices or games. Professional sports will suffer and be forced to spend money on more indoor facilities equipped with powerful evaporative humidifiers that don’t release any harmful chemicals in the air and can improve the indoor air quality.  
High school, club and recreational sports will suffer significantly more than teams at the professional level. With budgets a fraction of the size as those of the MLB or NFL, more practices and games will be canceled in order to protect the players. Wildfire season occurs largely in the fall, when football is taking place. High school football programs will likely need to shorten their seasons or start later in the year in order to account for time missed due to fires. 
Despite what Smokey the Bear says, it’s not just you who can prevent wildfires. They’re inevitable and will occur more frequently in our changing environment. It’s important to follow fire safety protocols, especially when in a dry or forested setting, but it will be difficult for our society to significantly decrease the number of wildfires each year. Sports, as well as the rest of the world, will have to adapt to account for the dangers that wildfires present.

After a weekend sweep of BYU, No. 6 men’s volleyball returns to action Wednesday night as the team welcomes George Mason University to Galen Center.
Following a 3-1 win over the Cougars Friday night, the Trojans beat them in straight sets Saturday to improve to 13-3 on the season. Only Hawaii has more wins than the Trojans, and only UCLA, Ball State and Long Beach State have fewer losses.
Despite the sweep, USC remained at No. 6 in the latest Coaches Poll. BYU, on the other hand, dropped out of the rankings following the loss to the Trojans.
“[Beating BYU twice] is something that doesn’t happen very often in men’s volleyball,” said redshirt senior captain and starting setter Chris Hall. “BYU is usually a very solid program at the top of the MPSF, so being able to beat them twice is really good.” 
Coupled with their 3-1 win over No. 7 Pepperdine Feb. 25, USC enters the match against George Mason having won three straight against teams ranked at the time of the contest.
The Trojans have had players recognized at the conference level for their play, as both Hall and junior middle blocker/opposite hitter Lucas Frassrand were named MPSF Defensive and Offensive Players of the Week, respectively. This marked the second time in the season that USC has swept the MPSF weekly honors.
Hall, currently in his fifth season as USC’s starting setter, leads the Trojans with 673 assists on the season. The Patriots have two important setters of their own in redshirt junior Zach Talamoa and freshman Troy McDonald.
Talamoa currently leads George Mason with 284 assists and is on pace for his third consecutive 400-assist season. Meanwhile, McDonald has racked up 242 assists despite splitting time with the veteran Talamoa. This match will also serve as a homecoming for McDonald, as he hails from nearby Manhattan Beach, Calif.
The Patriots sit at 7-7 overall and 2-5 in conference play. Hall knows that the Trojans cannot look past the match.
“These games against George Mason, Vanguard and Menlo are very important,” Hall said. “We can’t look down on a team. We know every team’s talented, and any given day, any team can win in volleyball.” 
USC aims to make its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2019 and just its second in the past ten years.
“We know that we have to win these [upcoming] games in order to keep our tournament contention alive,” Hall said. “Every match really does make a big difference at the end when they’re deciding who makes what.” 
The Trojans and Patriots are set to square off at 7 p.m. at Galen Center Wednesday night.

It’s Women’s History Month, the time of year to celebrate the achievements and history of notable girl bosses and trailblazing women. Celebratory traditions may include busting out our “nasty women rock!” crop tops and watching “Jennifer’s Body” over and over. There’s just one problem: In its attempt to celebrate women, Women’s History Month reduces women’s issues to a pitiful show of performative feminism.
Now, I will admit, it was a well-intended attempt — a noble one, even. Along with other months celebrating marginalized groups, Women’s History Month was a step in the right direction towards recognizing, reforming and redressing long-standing injustices. It feels good to take a break from the upward climb towards gender equality to admire how far we’ve come. But it has been more than 30 years since Congress officially recognized Women’s History Month, and in those 30 years, the significance of Women’s History Month hasn’t moved past the first “r:” Recognition.
We need to go a step further — several steps, in fact. Solely focusing on how far we’ve come and how much better it is to be a woman today compared to 50 years ago encourages people to think the problems have been solved. This sentiment pushes the idea that gender-based discrimination was a thing of our ugly past and we can finally wipe our hands clean, close the book and continue with our lives. There is a distorted attitude that the debt our society owes women, and every group “celebrated” by these special months, can be paid through a footnote on our calendars.
Women’s History Month often feels like a month dedicated to teaching men about how women deserve to be treated, which focuses less on women and their rights and more on making women’s history more palatable and convenient for men in an attempt to educate men about the gender inequalities we face. Women don’t need to hear how much less we get paid compared to men — we know. But, every March, I see the same Instagram social justice slideshows broadcasting the same general statistic of women earning 82 cents for every dollar a man doing the same work makes. Not to mention the fact that it’s even less if you’re not white. I find myself irked by the fact that it’s the men that need to hear all this, not me. It’s time that women stop bearing the burden of ending gender-based discrimination.
Curriculum surrounding Women’s History Month tends to commoditize women’s productivity. It pushes the narrative that women are only valuable when they achieve extraordinarily difficult things such as flying across the planet solo or burning at the stake in the name of French liberation. And while the fact that more women are entering male-dominated fields is a sign of great progress, it comes at the continued devaluation of traditionally female-dominated fields such as nursing, childcare and elementary teaching. What about ordinary women? What about the women who bolstered our coronavirus relief effort and childcare sectors during the pandemic?
Somewhere along the way, Women’s History Month became less about exposing young girls to barrier-breaking role models and more about memorizing the names of famous feminists. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Simone de Beauvoir, Gloria Steinem — we all know their names, but lack a deep understanding of how exactly they raised and shaped early feminist movements. 
That’s not to mention another problem with women’s history curriculum: It focuses on the experiences and contributions of white, cisgender women and not enough on marginalized groups. In fact, it wasn’t until I became a student at USC that I was first exposed to the works of Bell Hooks, Roxane Gay and Angela Davis.
We must recognize that Black women fought to pass the Civil Rights Act and continue to lead the Black Lives Matter movement. Native American women have been fighting for conservation and climate justice for generations. Women of the labor movement are fighting for fair wages, benefits and conditions. LGBTQ+ women are fighting to secure the rights, identities and livelihoods of trans women and kids. 
When you look at it this way, not only do we see that women’s history goes so much deeper than fighting for suffrage or equal pay for white women, but that it also becomes harder to draw a line between what’s considered “women’s history” and what’s regular history. That’s the way it should be. Women’s history is world history and must be integrated into the curriculum as such.
When a man goes into space, that’s history. When Sally Ride, a respected physicist and astronaut, becomes the first woman to go into space, that’s women’s history. By isolating the recognition of women’s history to a single month of the year and by restricting women’s history to a single section or paragraph of our history textbooks, we’re reducing women to a subset of history, rather than an integral part of it. As a matter of fact, the mere existence of Women’s History Month is an implicit admission that we don’t do enough to support women throughout the other 11 months of the year. 
Women’s History Month ought to be an opportunity to not just recognize women’s struggles and achievements but also actively challenge the culture and systems that make such achievements a struggle in the first place.

Content warning: This article contains references of sexual assault, drugging and violence.
The beginning of the spring semester saw a whirlwind of students grappling for a place in the multitude of USC Greek life houses. Although this may seem innocent enough — Greek life is an important aspect of many individuals’ college experiences — the recent controversies that have erupted from these institutions brings into question the enthusiasm so many students hold.
Last October, staggering news came out about druggings and sexual assaults at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house. As the investigation continued, it was discovered that there were additional reports of assault or suspicious activity from four other fraternities, including Chi Phi Eta Delta, Delta Tau Delta — which were both placed on interim suspension, meaning they could not host social events or recruit new members — and Kappa Sigma — which was placed on modified suspension, meaning they could host no social events, but could still recruit new members.  
January saw a reinvigoration of social activity on USC’s infamous Frat Row — the line of Greek life houses that adorn 28th Street — and it seems that many students are choosing to forget about the accusations that were made just a few months ago. In fact, around 4,000 students still opt to actively participate in Greek life.
Although there are rather basic — and questionable — precautions being taken to “ensure” that socials and parties are “as safe as possible,” what kind of message are we sending to the victims who fought against these establishments and these events so courageously? Honestly, it’s a bit unsettling.
In a broader context, the entire structure of fraternities and sororities has to be looked at with more scrutiny. At its very core, Greek life is undoubtedly an extremely privileged and materialistic approach to socialization. Not only do you have to pay money to accept a bid, but active members have to take a hefty amount every semester. The cost of being a member of a fraternity or sorority can cost anywhere from $600 to $6,000 per semester, not including rush and alumni fees.
Although there are houses that offer scholarships to those unable to pay, it can be an arduous process, and the price point alone can be a great deterrent for those who may be financially insecure. This tends to leave students who are better-off financially as viable candidates, creating a very particular social atmosphere within the Greek life community. 
On top of exclusion in terms of finances, Greek life has also proven to be a hotbed for racial exclusion. 
Although universities as a whole began to integrate in the mid-20th century, “many white Greek-letter organizations added race clauses to their policies in order to keep their membership exclusive to white students,” according to Los Angeles Magazine. These race clauses were enacted in order to keep Greek life as “whites only.” Even now, finding people of color at any given fraternity or sorority can be painstakingly difficult, and their lack of diversity is not a fair reflection of USC’s student body. The @black_at_usc Instagram page features dozens of incidents of racism identified by anonymous staff and students at Greek life events. This isn’t an anomaly.
A final piece in the Greek life puzzle is its long history of accepting members and pushing them towards certain physical images, especially within sororities. According to The Atlantic writer Catherine Mitchell, there has been quite a bit of research done that indicates that larger girls who rush consistently have worse experiences. Additionally, Mitchell wrote on studies that show that being in a sorority has a “negative effect on eating behavior and correlates with disordered eating.” Research has suggested that this is “partially because of the increased social pressure for thinness.” 
Not only are mostly white and wealthy students being admitted into these organizations, but mostly thin ones are, too. So what kind of society is Greek life trying to formulate?
After detailing the broader, more universal history of these social organizations as well as delving into USC’s own intimate past, it’s difficult to see why the system is still appealing to so many students when there are so many career and connection-oriented programs on campus that do not reflect such problematic standards. Isn’t making friends organically better than making them after paying thousands of dollars? And what does it say about an individual if they continue to uphold the same white, thin, and rich image that these groups have pushed for the past century?
