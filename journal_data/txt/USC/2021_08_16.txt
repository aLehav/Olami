At 20 years old, Colman Domingo was finding his footing in the San Francisco theatre scene. 
He had moved from his childhood home of Philadelphia to start his career in the Golden Gate city. But it was not all easy, and, when frustration arose, Domingo called a trusted confidante for advice: his mother. 
The guidance she gave him, however, was off the beaten path.
 “She said, ‘You need a hobby,’” Domingo said in a phone interview with the Daily Trojan. “‘You need something that you do that is not about you,’ and I took that to heart … She said, ‘You’re so good with kids, what if you taught somewhere?’”
The answer took form as part of an afterschool program taught by his friend Phara. While auditioning and working side jobs to get by, Domingo volunteered 20 hours a week to teach kids. He describes the time as fulfilling, an homage to his mother who was ultimately right about her advice, Domingo said. 
For years after, and in a balancing act with the promising trajectory of his career, Domingo went on to instruct as a guest lecturer at various universities, including the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center. 
“It’s always been very important to me, that no matter what I’m doing, that I leave room for teaching,” Domingo said.
One Fated Day in San Francisco
On May 4, the School of Dramatic Arts announced in a news release that Domingo would join its faculty starting as a guest lecturer this fall before transitioning into a full-time position in Fall 2022. 
The move to get Domingo to be a part of the school had been five years in the making, said Oliver Mayer, SDA associate dean of faculty. However, Mayer and Domingo’s history began long before that.
The duo met in 1997 in San Francisco. Mayer had written a play called “Blade to the Heat,” an exploration of masculinity in the world of boxing. Its third production was in a small venue in the Bay Area, where he met Domingo for the first time.
“I had heard about Colman Domingo, before I met him, as just being an all-around consummate professional. It’s the same thing I say about him now — that he can dance, and he can sing, and he’s a wonderful actor and he’s a great person and a fabulous colleague,” Mayer said in a phone interview with the Daily Trojan. “Then, when I came to rehearsal, there he was, and he was all that and more.”
“I had heard about Colman Domingo, before I met him, as just being an all-around consummate professional. It’s the same thing I say about him now — that he can dance, and he can sing, and he’s a wonderful actor and he’s a great person and a fabulous colleague.”
Domingo played one of the non-boxer parts in the play, using his jack-of-all-trades skills to deliver a memorable performance of a singer. 
“We were able to connect as artists. He understood my play. And I think he understood me, and we had a friendship,” Mayer said. “Then, because of the world the way it is — this was before we all walked around with cell phones — it wasn’t as easy to contact each other. And I lost track of him for a while.”
Mayer saw Domingo twice after the play in San Francisco: at the Broadway district in New York City and on the set of “Fear the Walking Dead” in Ensenada, Mexico. 
Marlene Forte, Mayer’s wife, played the role of Celia Flores in “Fear the Walking Dead,” a spin-off of the post-apocalyptic zombie show “The Walking Dead.” Forte told Mayer she was nervous of being in the show, where Domingo was also cast as Victor Strand. Mayer told her to not be nervous and suggested she talk to Domingo and mention that “Oliver said hi.” 
“She contacted me the next day, and she was so happy. Because when she said it, everybody was all together; it was kind of awkward, and it can be like that sometimes,” Mayer said. “And, [when] she said it, he grabbed her and twirled her around because he was so happy to hear that we had this connection.”
Afterward, Mayer traveled down to Ensenada to spend time with Forte and the show’s cast. On their drive back home from Ensenada, an idea popped into Mayer’s head: Would Domingo want to teach at USC one day?
The Discipline of Theatre
“On top of his many credits, Colman is a master teacher, so we will ask him to offer both undergraduate and graduate courses ranging from acting for the camera and performance for digital media to dramatic writing,” SDA Dean Emily Roxworthy said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Colman has said that theatre is his first love, comparing it to a spiritual practice that brings our fractured world together.”
“The technical things I can teach you in the classroom, but you need life if you’re going to reflect life.”
While honing his craft throughout the years, Domingo has worked with and been inspired by people who all share a similar philosophy: “You’ve got to become a better human,” Domingo said he encourages his students to know about art history, science, architecture travel and “falling in love and falling out of love.”
“You need all of that, essentially,” Domingo said. “The technical things I can teach you in the classroom, but you need life if you’re going to reflect life.”
A guiding principle Domingo values in the classroom — where he has now spent about 13 years of his life — is having a baseline of respect. He uses the setting to be a reflection of the entertainment industry functions; for example, a person’s lack of punctuality is an extension of how someone might show up late for rehearsal. He said that he isn’t a person to solely prioritize the syllabus as if it were a “bible,” but rather to go “where the moment takes you.”
“I’m so interested in empowering my students to tell the story the way they want to tell it, more than anything,” Domingo said. “When it comes down to it, if I’m hard in any way, it’s just about being respectful of the work, and I will lay out what that is.”
Mayer concurs and said Domingo has a confidence in bringing out the better selves in individuals.
“He’s got a confidence in the art that tells students and faculty that it’s worth it to continue,” Mayer said. “And we really need to hear that.”
Stories That Matter
It was never enough for Domingo to just be an actor. He knew that he had to be a writer, a director, a producer.
“I had to make it happen … people didn’t look like me, so they didn’t know my story mattered or existed,” Domingo said. “Once I had to get to the other side of the table, it was not enough for me to just be a creative, but I had to think like a business person as well.”
Domingo’s mindset went into questioning how he could create opportunities for other underrepresented people to tell their stories and to be reassured that they matter. Although he describes this era as a “golden age of creativity of all platforms,” he attributes the cultural shift to people of color saying “enough was enough.”
“I had to make it happen … people didn’t look like me, so they didn’t know my story mattered or existed. Once I had to get to the other side of the table, it was not enough for me to just be a creative, but I had to think like a business person as well.”
His dedication to creating an equitable and inclusive world in storytelling aligns with SDA’s objective to empower its students to “use theatre in service to the larger world” through “artistic excellence” that entertain and inspire, Roxworthy wrote.
It isn’t time to get comfortable with breakthroughs or singular awards nominations, Domingo said.
“We need more. More storytelling, more producers. MJ [Rodriguez] is a friend of mine,” Domingo said. “I want her to be a producer. I want her to have her own company. I want her to use this opportunity to make more doors open.”
(Rodriguez, who plays Blanca Evangelista in “Pose,” made history as the first transgender woman to receive an Emmy nomination for Best Actress.)
Domingo, who has spent the pandemic researching and reconnecting with his family history, describes the amplification of underrepresented stories and representation as akin to bringing his relatives along for the ride. 
“That goes back to not only my African American but my Central American heritage,” Domingo said. “Which is, if you open the door, we bring everybody with us.”

As we finally make the transition back to campus, it’s likely that many Trojans, both new and returning, will be searching for the best places to grab a bite and hang out with friends. Luckily, we’ve got you covered with some favorite student spots to dine in Los Angeles.
Grand Central Market
Wallet Breaker Rating: Varies
This historical landmark is a staple site in downtown Los Angeles. As the largest and oldest public market in L.A., Grand Central Market offers 40 stalls filled with a vibrant blend of vendors, ranging from vegan ramen to Michoacán-style carnitas. A few notable mentions include Prawn Coastal, Belcampo Meat Co., Eggslut and La Tostadería. There really is no shortage of choices here, so there’s a little bit of something for everyone.
Northern Cafe
Wallet Breaker Rating: $$$$
If you’re on the lookout for some warm comfort food or a quick bite, Northern Cafe is a great place to visit — and just a 10-minute walk away from campus. This spot is open until 9:30 p.m. every night and features a variety of Chinese food options to satisfy your cravings. Whether you’re looking for noodles, tofu or pancakes, they have it all. Many students regularly swing by this location in particular to order some of their delicious handcrafted dumplings.
Sugarfish
Wallet Breaker Rating: $$$$
Searching for a great sit-down experience or incredible takeout? Consider choosing Sugarfish. With multiple locations in the Los Angeles area and a prominent social media presence, it’s only a matter of time before you hear someone gush about this sushi restaurant. 
What makes Sugarfish stand out from other sushi spots is the freshness and high quality of its traditional sushi offerings as well as its personable service (if you decide to dine-in). A lot of students enjoy ordering takeout or delivery from here when they need a sushi fix. The food is not only delectable but also comes in aesthetically pleasing packaging, which takes the eating experience one step further.
Blu Jam Cafe
Wallet Breaker Rating: $$$$
Blu Jam Cafe has quickly gained a reputation as one of the most prominent go-to brunch places in Los Angeles, and rightfully so. With six different L.A. locations, Founder and Executive Chef Kamil leads the team in serving only the freshest food with the finest ingredients, so you won’t find anything with corn syrup or artificial flavors here. They serve quite a range of vegan and non-GMO options to accommodate various dietary needs. 
Their most popular and widely photographed offering is the “Crunchy French Toast.” It comes with French brioche bread rolled in crunchy corn flakes and topped with fresh berries, powdered sugar and vanilla bean sauce (which comes on the side as an alternative to syrup).
Dollar Hits
Wallet Breaker Rating: $$$$
Arguably one of the most affordable eating options off-campus, Dollar Hits hosts a sprawling selection of Pilipino street food. This hot spot, located in Historic Filipinotown, draws in many patrons simply because of its cheap pricing — $1 for each BBQ skewer. 
Upon arrival at the restaurant, diners grab a tray and choose which skewers they’d like to cook. After paying, they make their way outside, find a spot to grill and then enjoy their eats! It truly is a fun, unique experience that allows some room for adventure — after all, each skewer is only a dollar, so why not try something new?
Tacos 1986
Wallet Breaker Rating: $$$$
Bringing some of the vibrant flavors of Tijuana to Los Angeles, Tacos 1986 serves a concentrated menu of mouth-watering Mexican food options that won’t break the bank. The tacos from this location pack the perfect balance of flavor, chewiness and seasoning. You might experience a bit of a wait during peak meal times, but plenty of people will tell you that it’s definitely worth the long line! 
Other than their famous tacos, a fan-favorite dish is the “vampiro de carnes asada.” This asada features double corn tortillas (grilled to just the right level of crunchiness) filled with protein, melted cheese, guacamole, cilantro and mild red salsa. Pair this with a cup of refreshing horchata, and you’re all set!

Once a childhood summer camp staple, beaded jewelry is back — but, now, it’s high fashion.
Drawing on the popular wave of Y2K nostalgia, designers from the poshest brands to independent creators are reminiscing on the bright beaded pieces of our youth. And USC jewelers are tapping into the growing subculture.
Caroline Cai, who graduated from USC last spring, started her Instagram jewelry store @clairolime after finding inspiration from other designers on the platform. Using old childhood trinkets, Cai began making intricate charm necklaces in the fall of 2020. Her page now boasts over 11,000 followers, which she attributes to the close-knit community she’s found online.
“I find that the community is really rich and encouraging, so we introduce each other to our followings … the sharing power of Instagram can make your work visible to so many people and I could have never imagined that something I’ve made would have crossed so many people’s pages,” Cai said.
Cai describes her jewelry-making style as “whimsical” and enjoys celebrating the playful aspects of childhood with her pieces. She combines pearls, beads and charms to create her looks, which have graced the necks of Instagram heavyweights like former Disney star Rowan Blanchard. 
She also credited her newfound hobby with keeping her creative while living at home during the pandemic. Cai said she believes that, since jewelry is wearable, it makes the creative process unique from other art forms. 
“Making a piece of art that stands alone is one thing, but marrying your personality and your spirit with it — I just think it’s something really special,” Cai said. 
Cai is close with two other jewelers at USC — Jing Feng and Maya Robles — all of whom frequently give each other advice and feedback on their jewelry-making businesses.  
Feng, a senior majoring in fine arts, dabbles in multiple artistic mediums but spends the most time on her jewelry company @harlothands on Instagram. While Feng initially didn’t intend to sell her pieces, she now runs a successful shop with over 52,000 followers. 
Her statement necklaces typically feature a centerpiece charm, such as a butterfly or a cross, with pearls and crystals surrounding it. Feng sources her materials from several places, including Ebay, antique shops and wholesale bead stores. 
“I really like vintage pendants and vintage items and objects that carry a history to them,” Feng said. “It really helps me create really unique and different kinds of pieces.”
The more complex chain-based necklaces can take up to three hours to make, but Feng enjoys the intricacy of the process. She also integrates her past creative pursuits like fashion into jewelry-making. Feng finds the practice of repurposing thrifted items similar to the upcycled nature of her pieces. 
“I’ve just been through a lot of different style and persona phases, and, making this jewelry, it’s kind of keeping each one of those alive even though I can’t incorporate all of them into my every day,” Feng said.  
Feng said her close bonds with Cai and Robles eases the burden of being a small business owner.
“We’ve created a really supportive and nurturing space, which I really appreciate and has helped me so much just in general in my entire life, my mental health and just on an everyday basis — having something to look forward to is really great,” Feng said. 
Robles, in a departure from beaded and chain necklaces, focuses on creating colorful rings with her page @fuchsiapeachrings. But Robles, a junior majoring in public relations and Spanish, still draws on Y2K aesthetics in her pieces. 
“I’m interested in the transformation from adolescence or even pre-pubescence into adulthood because a lot of times that is refracted through different objects that people own,” Robles said.  
A fuchsia peach design defines itself with its charm, which hangs from a vintage lucite ring. Previous designs include “Mariposa,” a vibrant blue, gem-encrusted ring with a dangling butterfly, and “My Cherry,” a square black ring with a cherry charm. 
Robles also donated part of the proceeds from her ring business to different mutual aid groups, including Hot and Cool Cafe, a coffee shop that hosts a community fridge in Leimert Park. She’s also donated to Reclaim and Rebuild Our Community, which advocates for unhoused people in El Sereno.
“My mom grew up in El Sereno and my grandma has been living there since she was a little girl, so I felt very connected to that community and I wanted to give back,” Robles said. 
While Robles isn’t sure where her ring business will take her, she knows she can rely on fellow USC jewelers for support.
“All of us are in this very niche, at times very weird, online community in which nobody else understands the inner workings or context of, and we can just talk to each other very candidly about what it is that’s going on,” Robles said.

Last fall, Kavin Kapoor, a sophomore from Singapore, woke up most days at 11 p.m., a 16 hour time difference from Los Angeles. He logged onto his cinematography classes in the middle of the night and worked until he went to bed at 9 a.m. 
Fed up with his flipped sleeping schedule, Kapoor, who majors in cinematic arts, film and television production, decided to live in L.A. for the spring semester. But, with the pandemic limiting Singapore’s embassies’ operation and restricting international travel, he faced added challenges.
“The visa process, I remember, was exceptionally difficult,” Kapoor said. “I went to the embassy in Singapore like three different times because I got rejected the first two, and then, because of [the coronavirus], they were shut down, so I couldn’t even enter.”
When Kapoor finally received his visa, there wasn’t the usual ‘Congrats’ or ‘Have fun in college’ from the embassy worker who stamped it. Instead, Kapoor said the demeanor of the stamp worker was, ‘Good luck, you might get deported.’
In Fall 2020, 9,950 international students enrolled at USC, the lowest enrollment since 2015, according to the Fall 2020 International Enrollment Fact Sheet by the USC Office of International Services. Less international students enrolled due to complications such as travel restrictions and closed embassies. As USC plans for a return to in-person learning, many international students still face uncertainties in returning to campus. 
“The biggest challenge many international students face will be simply getting to USC,” according to Anne Goldman, assistant director of USC OIS, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Securing flights and visas continue to be a challenge for students from certain regions of the world.” 
USC schools such as the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the School of Cinematic Arts surveyed their international students, asking if they anticipated delays in returning to campus, the date they expected to arrive and if they experienced any obstacles arranging their travels. 
“We’re expecting about 15% of our [Annenberg] international students to be [arriving later] in the fall and that may be part of the semester or the entire semester,” Director of the Annenberg School of Journalism Gordon Stables said in an interview with the Daily Trojan on Aug. 4. “That’s where we are right now, but we know that things are still pretty fluid for a lot of students.”
Considering Annenberg’s graduate programs predominantly comprise of international students compared to undergraduate programs, this fall, 93% of Annenberg undergraduate classes will be offered in-person, as opposed to over 70% of graduate courses.
OIS has offered advising sessions, OIS Live, five days a week since Summer 2020 to help international students navigate returning to the U.S. and USC. In OIS Live, students can drop in for a one-on-one Zoom consultation with an OIS advisor.
Veda Bansal, a sophomore from India majoring in biomedical engineering, attended OIS Live sessions and said they helped her navigate her spring return.
“I went to a lot of [OIS Live sessions] before coming [to the U.S.] because I was like, ‘Can I come, what papers do I need, how do I get a visa, how does this SEVIS [Student and Exchange Visitor Information System] get activated, do I need a hybrid class?”’
International students have also come together to help each other navigate customs once they arrived in the U.S.. In the ‘Internationals at USC’ Facebook group, Hana Liu, a senior from Taiwan majoring in intelligence and cyber operations, compiled a list of every document international students needed to obtain a visa. Among the list was a USC acceptance letter and financial support documents such as a bank statement and a copy of Spring 2021 registered classes for proof of a hybrid class. With all USC classes online, international students needed classes that appeared hybrid on paper to be accepted into the U.S.
“Just going through that ordeal, trying to figure things out, I just wanted to summarize [the information] and tell everyone as well because then they don’t have to go through that, and I know how scary it is to not know,” Liu said. 
As Kapoor prepared for the U.S., he consulted OIS and compared notes with other international students planning to make the same journey to ensure he gathered all the necessary documents. Because entering the U.S. during the pandemic was such an uncertain trip with unclear rulings such as hybrid classes, international students risked making the entire journey, only to be turned away at customs when an immigration officer decides not to allow them in. While scrolling on Facebook, Kapoor came across Liu’s post. 
“[Liu] took that risk and went to L.A. and then told us what to print out, what to pack and what to do to get past immigration,” Kapoor said. “I was really prepared.”
To accommodate for international students unable to return in the fall, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will offer online general education courses and seminars, Writing 150 courses, and large science, technology, engineering and math lectures and labs  “at times convenient for overseas time zones,” according to an email to the Daily Trojan by the Dornsife College Dean of Undergraduate Education Emily Anderson.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Richard Fliegel, associate dean for undergraduate programs at Dornsife, said he looked to ensure that students who could not access visas may take classes at times that worked best for international time zones. International freshmen were also permitted to register for their GE seminars and WRIT 150 classes before freshmen orientations.
Fliegel has also worked with professors to offer classes earlier in the morning and later in the evening, such as at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
“We were looking forward to the prospect of being able to have everybody back relatively safe and vaccinated, and now it’s more complicated, because of the [Delta] variant,” Fliegel said. “But again, we are committed to the idea of providing an excellent academic experience for all of our students, new students and continuing students.”
In addition to organizing travel plans, students who remained in their home country for the past year were required to arrange vaccine plans following their arrival in the U.S., according to a University message June 18. Jacqueline Ussher, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies and business administration, lives in Brazil where vaccines were not offered to young adults until Aug. 9. To receive it earlier, she decided to travel to the U.S. in July to get her vaccination.
However, due to a travel ban, Ussher had to quarantine in another country before arriving in the U.S. She stayed in Mexico for two weeks, and once she arrived in the U.S. at a time when some mask mandates had been lifted, she found the environment and approach to the coronavirus different than in  Brazil. 
“When I got there, I think it was when it was like no mask. So everyone was going out, completely different. After staying home for like a year, it was kind of crazy to see. It was really nice, but it’s also kind of rough to see that because I feel like a lot of Americans start thinking that [the coronavirus is] over or that everything is normal or stuff like that, but in reality, you still have to take all precautions and be careful,” Ussher said.
With different vaccines and vaccination availability in other countries, some international students have yet to meet USC’s vaccination requirements. As of Aug. 9, the current World Health Organization vaccines accepted by USC are AstraZeneca, Covishield, Sinovac, Sinopharm/BIBP, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen.
In a student media briefing Aug. 5, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said many students who are not compliant with USC’s vaccine requirement are international students given the different vaccination rollouts in other countries. As of Aug. 10, 66% of undergraduate international students and 75% of graduate international students are fully vaccinated, compared to nearly 90% of undergraduate and graduate domestic students. 
By offering coronavirus testing and vaccination appointments, USC created accommodations for international students to receive vaccinations, with many appointments in August when students begin arriving. 
“I think the biggest issues have been just simply, you know, there are students who can’t get a vaccine yet,” Van Orman said. “They’re just going to need to wait till they come to the United States to do that, so we really want to work with those people.”
Liu, who spent the summer in London for an internship, faced similar travel concerns when preparing for USC this fall. Arranging the logistics of returning from her internship and facing unclear guidance, she turned to OIS, advisors and students.
“I think the hard part is that [the advisors are] also confused because it’s more like the government not being so clear on how the regulations are actually applied, and so they’re trying to figure it out,” Liu said. “So they weren’t able to give us the clearest answers because they also weren’t sure. And it’s easy to be frustrated at them, but I always had to tell myself it’s also their job; they’re also trying to figure it out.”

Eva Furlani thought she had put the coronavirus disease behind her after she recovered in March 2020. Within a month, her normally thick hair started falling out rapidly. 
“I feel like everyone’s had that nightmare before, where you’re just in the shower and hair falls out,” said Furlani, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. “Then when it happens to you, you’re like ‘Oh my god,’ what did someone do to my shampoo?” 
Furlani’s hair loss only began to wane around seven months after she tested positive for the coronavirus. She and her doctor later deduced that the likely cause was a mild presentation of “long-haul COVID.”  
The Centers for Disease Control defines “long” or “long-haul COVID” as health problems that continue or appear four or more weeks following a coronavirus infection. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include heart palpitations, fatigue, loss of smell and taste and new or worsening cognitive and mental health issues. 
A Keck School of Medicine of USC news release stated that, similar to national levels, nearly 10% of Keck Medicine’s coronavirus patients have experienced long-haul COVID. Although college-aged young adults have low fatality and severe coronavirus illness rates, the Keck release noted that the majority of long-COVID cases at Keck were within the ages of 20 to 40.
For USC alumna Morgan Stephens, contracting the coronavirus disease was supposed to be a brief interruption to her fast paced life as a journalist. However, it developed into a life-changing ordeal that stretched on for eight months.  
Stephens tested positive for the coronavirus on Nov. 6, 2020; she had graduated with bachelor’s degrees in political science and journalism that May.
A month after her initial illness, she began to experience a variety of new severe medical symptoms including internal and external tremors, blood pressure issues, shortness of breath, insomnia, extreme anxiety, accute brain fog and autonomic nervous system issues.
Stephens said some of the most debilitating were brain fog: She struggled to comprehend movie plots or conversations, had a constant sense of vertigo and severe mental distress. Her symptoms were most intense for the first four months.
“It was a situation where it wasn’t day by day, it was minute by minute, and if it wasn’t minute by minute, it was moment by moment, to survive,” Stephens said. 
After graduating, Stephens worked as a production assistant for CNN, a “high speed, high stress” position. The transition from her active career to pausing her work and young adult life due to illness was devastating, she said.
“That has been something very difficult to grapple with, as someone who was very much goal oriented [and] career focused, getting sick to where I couldn’t cognitively comprehend conversations,” Stephens said. “I felt like my whole identity had been taken away, in addition to my health.”
Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing June 15 that treatment for people suffering from long-haul COVID is “multidisciplinary,” and could include referrals to different specialists such as cardiologists, psychologists or physical therapists depending on the individual’s symptoms. 
For treatment, Student Health may refer patients to the Keck Medicine COVID Recovery Center, which is designed to develop a specialized medical care and management plan for those experiencing long-haul COVID symptoms. 
“There isn’t something that will immediately reverse the effects, but, rather, we’re looking at what the symptoms are and then, usually from a rehabilitative approach, how [we can] help get that person back to better functioning,” Van Orman said. 
Stephens has been a patient at the Keck Recovery center since February 2021. She receives treatment from USC neurology, cccupational therapy and physical therapy.
“[The Keck Recovery center is] really searching for a solution or at least some kind of palliative care; where they can at least just treat the symptoms and give me a little bit of relief,” Stephens said.
Although Furlani said her symptoms were fortunately not medically dangerous or physically painful, and were not severe enough to impair her daily function, she still felt self-conscious about her physical appearance. Combined with uncertainty about the cause or implications of her symptom, the experience caused significant harm to her mental health during the last academic year. 
“I thought [I] got through [getting the coronavirus]. I thought I did the hard part,” Furlani said. “And I think for me as a young person, a young, healthy person, actually having [the coronavirus] wasn’t the hard part. The hard part was the effects.”
Long-haul COVID cases such as Stephens’ can become severe enough to impair basic everyday function, according to The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, who jointly released new guidelines in late July that recognized long-haul COVID as a federally protected disability under the Americans with Disability Act. Stephens filed for and received two months of disability status from the state. 
Senior Director of the Office of Student Accessibility Services Debbie Jih said OSAS is well equipped to support students requesting long-haul COVID disability support. 
Students with debilitating forms of long-haul COVID who contact OSAS can expect an assignment to an OSAS disability specialist and accommodations that may include testing accommodations, residential or dining accommodations, classroom accommodations and advocacy on behalf of the student to professors, Jih said.
Although long-haul COVID has received increased recognition in recent months, Jih said the lack of research and awareness surrounding the symptoms could be frustrating to those experiencing it.
“It’s important to listen to the student, hear them out on their unique experience because I think given how new long-COVID is, it could be easily dismissed by peers or others in the community,” Jih said. 
Furlani said that before she became aware of long-haul COVID, not knowing the cause of her hair loss contributed to a chronic sense of panic and worry about her health. Furlani said that having a diagnosis was extremely validating. 
Stephens said that even though she had a diagnosis, the lack of research and available treatments for long-haul COVID continues to an added medical and mental challenge. 
“When no one knows how to help you, even people in the ER, even specialists, even your primary care physician, you begin to lose hope. And you also begin to question yourself,” Stephens said. “And that’s a really tough place to be when you’re already suffering so much with physical symptoms, so it’s extremely difficult and it’s extremely anxiety provoking.”
According to Jih, the novelty of long-haul COVID will not be a barrier to effective disability support, as OSAS is experienced with students who have debilitating forms of a variety of chronic illnesses and injuries. 
“We’re very knowledgeable about looking at the functional limitations or symptoms, and then seeing how they could be addressed through all these different types of accommodations that we have,” Jih said. 
Furlani is optimistic that she is recovering. Stephens is still receiving extensive treatment but is seeing improvements.  
“I feel like I’m finally kind of gaining ground again and getting a semblance of normalcy being back at work, and having a little bit less symptoms these days,” Stephens said.

As the fall semester approaches and USC looks to fill lecture halls with students and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with screaming fans, vaccines have offered an opportunity for University students, faculty and staff to finally return to normal with a lessened risk of contracting the coronavirus.
However, misinformation,   institutional distrust, religious views and lack of access have slowed the vaccination rate in the United States, threatening reopening plans and increasing the risk of coronavirus outbreaks. The Delta variant, which is two times more contagious than the initial coronavirus strain according to NPR, has further heightened the urgency for vaccinations. 
According to the “LA County Daily COVID-19 Data” page, 3,865 new cases were reported Aug. 12. Between Aug. 1 and 7, USC reported 47 positive cases out of 2,961 tests — 37 students and 10 employees. 
USC is requiring vaccinations from all community members, barring religious or medical exemptions. Before the recent increase in cases, students were allowed to file a vaccine declination form if the vaccines were still under emergency use authorization. 
In March, USC launched its Covid-19 Vaccination Program and strongly encouraged all faculty, staff and students on campus to receive vaccinations as soon as they became eligible. 
As of Aug. 10, 90% of domestic undergraduate and 89% of graduate domestic students — students who are U.S. residents — 66% of undergraduate international students, 75% of graduate international students, 90% of faculty and 88% of staff are vaccinated, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Thursday. The number of vaccinated international students is expected to rise as students arrive to the U.S., where the vaccine is more available, Van Orman said. 
Charlie Siegel, a sophomore majoring in public relations, was vaccinated early February. He spent last school year living in an off-campus apartment, and he saw many of his peers get vaccinated as well.
“All the people that I surround myself with were definitely very eager to get vaccinated, as I think everyone should be,” Siegal said. “It’s such a revolutionary vaccine in the first place … and I definitely think that everyone should be eager to go and get it.”
Despite the push Siegel noticed from USC through emails and social media posts, the current vaccine policies left him with some anxieties about the upcoming school year.
“I do think that there are a lot of people our age that are kind of relaxed about it just because they think we’re still young and that it’s not going to affect us as badly … I don’t think a lot of people our age look into the news as much as they should,” Siegel said. “There’s so much information out there that they really should be reading to make themselves more aware of this issue, because it’s so directly affecting us and our ability to enjoy our college experience.”
To allow students, faculty and staff to inquire about vaccinations and their health, USC launched the community outreach program, “Ask a Doc.”
“We are coming to the phase where there are people who are vaccine hesitant,” Minnie Ho, executive director of communications at USC Student Health, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “What we’d like to do, as health professionals and to support our public health initiative is really to encourage everyone in the public to get vaccinated, and also to dispel some reasons why people might be hesitating to get the vaccine, which are not based on factual information.”
The program emphasizes health communication research, particularly the idea that pro-vaccine messages are likely to be trusted by the public when they come from two particular categories of people: doctors and University leaders. 
The program organized messengers with a wide scope of experiences who will be available to address questions and concerns for people in different schools. It will also have workshops, including one for people with a fear of needles.
“The purpose of [the sessions] is not to have debate about COVID and policies that the government took over the past year, but really the purpose is to educate on what we do know about the vaccine,” said Dr. Kimberly Tilley, co-medical director of USC Student Health, in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
For those who decline the vaccine, other requirements are in place to limit cases on campus.
“[Unvaccinated members of the USC community] have to participate in regular surveillance testing, which is twice a week for undergraduates and once a week for graduate professional students, faculty and staff,” Van Orman said. 
However, provided that unvaccinated people follow testing requirements, they will not be restricted from events or campus activities. 
“We are creating all of our events to be a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people,” Van Orman said. “We won’t create anything that excludes people who are unvaccinated, provided they are complying with the surveillance testing requirements.”
USC continues to plan a return to in-person classes for Fall 2021 and is devising an in-person convocation to welcome new students to campus. Though coronavirus regulations are uncertain, health and University officials are confident that USC will have high vaccination rates in the upcoming semester.
“By the time everybody comes back to campus, the numbers are going to be way over 90%,” Van Orman said. “There’s groups of students who just simply weren’t able to get the vaccine, and once they arrived, we’re going to be far above 95% in terms of the percent of our campus that’s fully vaccinated.”

Nearly 600 USC faculty and staff signed a “United Statement of Grave Concerns” addressed to USC administration Aug. 4, criticizing the University for requiring all student-facing staff to return in-person five days a week beginning Aug. 16.
According to the letter, departments and schools were initially told to make their own return plans; however, the University later decided everyone will be required to return to in-person work five days a week, regardless of the department or school’s initial plans.
Faculty and staff who signed the letter cited concerns about the coronavirus, shorter commute times and the ability to work efficiently at home as reasons for staying home. The letter requested a response from USC administration within three business days. The following Monday, administrators emailed all faculty and staff reaffirming the new policies.
Patrick Patterson, an assistant registrar at USC, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that the change frustrated him and other staff members. 
“It was just this huge, huge kick in the gut,” Patterson said. “Now we’re being told, ‘Oh, nope, you have to go into work every day of the week,’ even though there’s increases in the Delta variant, the delta plus variant, the lambda variant. And the fact that we really have proven for this past year and a half that we can responsibly do our work in a flexible working environment.”
A senior academic advisor, who wished to remain anonymous because of concerns about her job security, said that faculty and staff members’ “expectations of leadership … were not being met” and that the administrators presented a “lack of transparency, lack of empathetic leadership and lack of trust.” 
“It is clear that, even after asking for departments to make their return to work plans, that leadership does not trust its employees,” the advisor said. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles F. Zukoski and Senior Vice President of Human Resources Felicia A. Washington ​​said that the University has taken steps to ensure that returning to campus will be safe. 
“If we follow safety protocols, and take care in our interactions with others, we will be safer on campus than we would be at the grocery store, in the gym, or at any indoor social gathering,” the statement said.
Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Thursday that, while the University is putting various measures in place to ensure a safe return, staff and faculty concerned about working in person should speak to their supervisors and schools.   
“Really what we’re focusing on is that this is a safe work environment,” Van Orman said. “There’s tons of mitigations in place … We have lots of things in place to make sure that we can protect [staff and faculty].”
In addition to the letter, staff criticized the USC administration on Twitter, condemning the administration for ignoring its values. 
Patterson said his department demonstrated to USC administrators that remote work can increase efficiency. 
“We’ve proven that, in many cases, we can do quantifiably more work, as has been the case in academic records and registrar, in a more efficient manner, with fewer resources over the past year and a half, while working from home,” Patterson said. 
On Thursday, USC officials held a Zoom webinar to address faculty and staff concerns. The advisor said that the webinar was “what you could expect from leadership,” and “very aligned with the messages that have been shared with students, faculty and staff.”   
“[The USC administration] mandate [is] to be transparent in their processes [and] how they are making decisions, to bring in students, faculty and staff, as stakeholders in the decisions that they make as people who are impacted by those decisions,” they said. “How did they decide that it’s safe to return? What are the metrics?”

Editor’s note: This story will be updated online as announcements from the University and individual schools become available. The following story includes updates as of Aug. 13. 
As Clint Wu plans to move to USC’s campus for the first time after more than a year of disruption to his traditional educational experience, he looks forward to meeting people in-person. Instead of attending classes between 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. from his room in Hong Kong and meeting peers through small Zoom windows that prevented him from developing meaningful relationships, Wu — like many other USC students — expects to find opportunities on campus that he found limited in the online setting.
“It’s already been a year of online classes, and I really want to experience [an] on-campus, traditional college lifestyle,” said Wu, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “As an international student, I paid full tuition, so it doesn’t make sense for me to be paying this much for online [classes].”
Nearly 18 months since USC shifted to online learning, USC plans to “return to the full breadth of in-person academic, research, clinical, and service activities,” President Carol Folt wrote in a communitywide email Aug. 5.
In Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman’s most recent community update Aug. 2, she announced that students arriving in Los Angeles will need to take a coronavirus test within three days of arrival or by Aug. 22. Beginning Sunday, Trojan Checks, a daily coronavirus symptom questionnaire that verifies up to date testing and vaccination requirements and that is necessary to enter campus, will require the completion of “Hygiene, Health and Safety,” an online module located on TrojanLearn. 
All students, faculty and staff are required to wear masks indoors at all campus facilities, regardless of vaccination status. The decision followed the rise of Delta variants in L.A. County early-July and the alike mask mandate issued by the county. 
Of the 15 schools from which the Daily Trojan requested Fall 2021 coronavirus guidelines, six schools shared their plans, including the Gould School of Law and the School of Dramatic Arts. Media representatives from the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance responded that each school will follow University guidelines. The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences referred the Daily Trojan to USC’s Central Communications. Six schools — including the Thornton School of Music and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism — did not respond to phone and email requests. 
 While all schools are required to comply with University regulations, some will make necessary course adjustments to serve the needs of all students.
In a July 20 email, Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis Yortsos confirmed that, while the University expects an on-campus return, the individual school will offer nearly all Fall 2021 Viterbi courses “for both in-person and remote attendance.” In an interview with the Daily Trojan July 26, Yortsos said he believes doctorate and specialized courses will be offered in-person.
For over 20 years, Viterbi has offered master’s courses online through its distance education network program, DEN@Viterbi, Yortsos said. The school’s decision to extend their online class offerings is intended to accommodate students who may be ill or who cannot attend campus for any other reason.  
“We did receive some comments, some reactions from some students overseas that they were worried that they may not be able to come to campus because of visa issues related to travel restrictions,” Yortsos said. “That’s why we wanted to make sure we accommodate them just like we accommodated last year.”
In a July 28 letter to Marshall School of Business undergraduate students, Marshall Vice Dean for Undergraduate Programs Ramandeep Randhawa confirmed courses will take place in-person, with the exception of students who are overseas or who have medical needs. Students who have medical needs must reach out to USC’s Office of Student Accessibility Services, and students overseas must sign an online petition. 
The Rossier School of Education will hold classes in the Waite Phillips Hall building because the building’s air flow complies with L.A. County Department of Public Health guidelines to reduce virus transmission. 
The USC Gould School of Law intends for students to show their Trojan Check verification before entering the law building beginning Aug. 16. Any student who requires an accommodation would need to contact the personnel office.
The School of Dramatic Arts intends to comply with L.A. County Department of    Public Health and University guidelines while continuing to perform by offering students clear masks to wear in voice lessons and rehearsals, Vice Dean of Academic & Administrative Affairs Lori Ray Fisher said in an interview with the Daily Trojan Aug. 11.
In an Aug. 11 letter, Roski School of Art and Design Dean Haven Lin-Kirk informed its students about the school’s plan to hold in-person events such as a picnic, an art festival with live performances and a “hands-on” workshop. The letter further emphasized that students would enter an upgraded Watts Hall with safety improvements such as better ventilation systems and touchless faucets.
Scott Macdonald, adjunct assistant professor of physics and astronomy, will teach four physics classes in the fall semester — three in-person and one on Zoom. Macdonald said that those who attend his in-person classes will abide by the guidelines issued by the University. 
“I’m perfectly comfortable to lecture with a mask on,” Macdonald said. “They have microphones I can plug to my lapel or even to my mask to help project my voice so it’s not too muffled. Students will be asked to keep masks on at all times. If they want to take a sip of water or something like that they can briefly pull it down to take a sip of water, but I’m going to ask that they keep it on for the duration of the lecture.”
Oscar Escobar, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering, said he feels comfortable about returning to in-person classes despite his concerns traveling from his home country, Mexico, to California. Escobar, who said he was depressed from taking classes online for a long period, finds attending classes in-person as his best option. 
“I’ll be taking up classes in person if I can,” Escobar said. “It’s very hard to get focused in your bed or in your bedroom or in your house, so going in person is way easier for me.”
Upon registering for classes, Escobar did not know about the status of his classes in regards to whether they will be hybrid or not. 
Angela Hernandez, a senior majoring in Middle East studies, plans to come to campus for the first time as a transfer. However, as a result of the increased infection rate of the Delta virus and the presence of potential unvaccinated students, she said she would not mind taking online classes.
“I’m really nervous because the transition to online was so hectic and weird,” Hernandez said. “Being in person, it’s just getting used to the new normal and [entering] a new school is pretty nerve racking for me.”
For Lucy Warren, a senior majoring in economics and the vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government, the University’s mask mandate made her feel “a lot more comfortable being on campus.” 
“Just navigating the medical system throughout COVID has been incredibly challenging, and I’m sure a lot of others can relate,” said Warren, who is immunocompromised. “But we were very cautious at home as well. I live with two other immunocompromised family members, and so we just locked down truly [and] did not go anywhere in public.”
While Warren has the same plans to return to campus “as every other student,” she still has concerns. 
“[Returning to campus is] just going to be so thrilling with thousands of people coming back together, and there’s just going to be an energy that’s electric when we return, and we see everybody,” she said. “But also, to be quite frank, [I’m] very, very scared … You’re not able to really know [if the] person that I’m in class with [is] vaccinated.”
Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, clinical professor of population and public health sciences, said he believes USC is ensuring the appropriate conditions for a safe return. As a former Centers for Disease Control medical officer and a member of the USC COVID-19 Pandemic Research Center, he helped provide the University with information on the best public health practices by conducting research on vaccine development.
“We have to be concerned if there’s additional variants that may be brought in, so we’ve been working with the University, using our research and other expertise to really make sure we have a good monitoring program, and that, as best we can, we can easily detect current variants and new variants,” Klausner said. “The good news is that, if one is vaccinated, the vaccines still are highly protective against all the variants that we’ve seen. The vaccines are 95% or more protective against serious disease, hospitalization and death.”
Klausner said everyone would need to comply with the University policy and follow classroom size limitations. With the Delta virus at hand, he said the USC community should expect little ongoing transmission once the University’s community immunity rate is at or higher than 90%.
Mark Schroeder, a professor of philosophy, intends to adjust his classroom setting after he receives the confirmed list of students signed up for his course. Schroeder said he understands the various sentiments students feel in regard to the way they will take their classes for the upcoming academic year. 
“I think that every student has had different experiences and also has different needs,” he said. “I think that it’s appropriate for students to have very different reactions and hopes and expectations, and the problem is that the way that things work is always a compromise between what benefits different people to different degrees.”
Warren believes that the University has taken a proper approach in regard to expecting over 40,000 students. She, though, sees the pandemic as ever-changing and impacting the plans of the University.
“I think the University has been really smart, in the way that they’ve handled it this summer in the phases that we’ve taken,” she said. “Unfortunately we just cannot predict this pandemic, and they are really doing their best to just stay on their toes and stay informed and continue planning for [the] best case scenario.”

It was late February 2020, and the No. 1 Trojans men’s tennis team just ousted Oregon with help from the determined duo of Daniel Cukierman and Riley Smith who took down the No.11 doubles team in the nation. This was the last time these two Trojans would be partnered together for the year, as their season got cut short following coronavirus lockdowns just as they were gaining momentum. 
Despite time away from traditional training, Cukierman and Smith did not sit back; they practiced to prepare for whenever they could resume playing. In spite oftraining separately during the off-season while in different continents and coming back in the following season with coronavirus restrictions, they maintained their place as one of the top doubles teams in their final season together, capping off their successful collegiate tennis career. 
Before the 2019-20 season was abruptly halted, the duo was ranked No. 5. Even though Smith did not have to travel far to get back to his home in Long Beach, Cukierman had to travel across the globe to get to his hometown of Tel Aviv, Israel. 
“I think it was definitely a different preparation, but overall it was kind of tough to finish it early, the season last year … but we really did believe as a team we can continue the good form as long as we all practiced hard back home,” Cukierman said. “We were all trying to play in as many tournaments as we could, so I was able to play some national tournaments in Israel and actually was able to play in Europe.” 
Despite being away from campus and unable to train together for an extended period of time, the doubles team came prepared this year and were ranked No. 1 in the early January preseason rankings. When the next doubles rankings came out on March 24, Smith and Cukierman had only dropped one place to No. 2. 
Between this time, the duo most notably beat rivals UCLA in the ITA Kickoff Weekend and Texas & TCU at the ITA Indoor Championships.  
This strong performance on the courts at the start of the season can be attributed to the hard work they put in on their own while being away from campus during the unprecedented break. 
“We [Smith and Cukierman] were both on our own — kind of — own training schedules. Playing in individualized tournaments and that sort of thing on our own,” Smith said. “So, we were always in touch, but it was definitely a little out of the ordinary.”
Having that type of consistent training was key to their success as a pair. They continued their impressive season together with wins against difficult opponents such as Arizona State’s nationally-ranked No. 42 duo at the time of Nathan Ponwith and George Stoupe. 
Nevertheless, despite having these successes as a tandem, Smith and Cukierman still dropped a couple more matches toward the end of the regular season which caused them to go down to No. 14 in the rankings.
Although they could not end their regular season on the same note they started, this did not deter their confidence going into the postseason in both the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments. 
They both sought to bounce back from the adversity they faced so far during their last dance, as they won all their doubles matches in the team tournaments taking down top-tier opponents such as Virginia’s No. 14 doubles team of Carl Soderland and William Woodall, and the No. 11 Longhorn duo of Eliot Spizzirri and Siem Woldeab in a thrilling tiebreaker win. 
Although they only became a Trojans top doubles team back at the start of the 2019-2020 season when current head coach Brett Masi joined, they quickly worked alongside each other to rise as one of the best pairings in the nation. Taking on the roll of the teams’ veterans helped strengthen their performance on the courts, setting an example for the rest of the team.
Overall, their ability to persevere and rebound from the losses they faced in the regular season showcased their maturity as some of collegiate tennis’ best players. Instead of focusing on the outcomes of previous matches, the duo simply concentrated on winning the matchup at hand. 
Cukierman said he and Riley and the rest of the team were able to bring out the best in each other in the face of adversity. 
“We had a couple disappointments, but I think it’s easier when you have a supportive team,” Cukierman said. “Riley and I, we were the leaders I would say this year … and we just push each other to do better and be better players to help the team.”
Masi echoed similar sentiments of how the doubles team persisted during the season and did not get distracted by any losses that they faced, rather using their losses as a learning opportunity to grow as players. 
“I mean look, in tennis at times you lose, and if you didn’t have the ability to put in the blinders and go out and compete, you wouldn’t be as successful as [Smith and Cukierman] ,” Masi said. “In any sport whether you are a tennis player, golfer, basketball player, you name it, you got to be able to take losses and use them for good and try to improve and get better.”
Once the Trojans NCAA team tournament run ended, the pair immediately prepared for the NCAA individual tournament where both players competed in singles and doubles. They made the quarterfinals, making them the first USC duo to do so since 2012. 
To get there, they had to knock off two top 10 nationally-ranked teams, the first being No. 8 ranked Juan Carlos Aguilar and Bjorn Thomson from Texas A&M in the Round of 32. Then, in the Round of 16, they won against TCU’s Luc Fomba and Alastair Gray, the No. 2 partnership in the nation. This triumph over the country’s second-best doubles team sent them to the quarterfinals.
It was here where their postseason winning streak ended in a tiebreaker upset against the No. 26 Auburn team of Tad Maclean and Finn Murgett. 
Getting ready for their part of the tournament right after witnessing the team face a heartbreaking loss at such a late stage did not deter the duo. Cukierman and Smith knew once again that they could not hang on to the past. As their last ride together, they knew they had to focus on the final doubles tournament together and simply have fun. 
“I mean I think that it was a hard one to deal with losing to Texas, but in doubles specifically we had a lot of fun playing together,” Smith said. “For me, it was one of the last tournaments I will play, so it was easy for me to get up and be ready for that event.”
On top of their impressive season together, the duo’s performance and leadership helped improve the play of other players on the team such as junior Bradley Frye. The Kansas native who was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week in March, went on an unbeaten doubles streak this season with sophomore Stefan Dostanic until the Pac-12 tournament finals against Arizona State. 
He cites the guidance of Smith and Cukierman and playing against them in practice as part of the reason he had success on the courts this season, especially in doubles with Dostanic. 
“I think for us, Stefan and I, to be able to compete with them [Smith and Cukierman] every single day not only helped us but I think helped them,” Frye said. “I think seeing how they worked together as a team and kinda figured out each other’s strengths and weaknesses that definitely helped Stefan and I. And once we started to get on a roll, we were able to challenge them a lot more.”
Masi, who witnessed their growth, respects the players they have become today. 
He called Cukierman a “very good leader in terms of his work ethic, in terms of his contributions to the team,” and an impactful member of the team. Masi, who has known Smith since he was five-years-old, emphasized how hard Smith worked on a daily basis. 
As a doubles team this season, Cukierman and Smith put up a 23-5 record in their final outing. Despite hiccups in the regular season, they stayed afloat as one of the nation’s top duos, which they eventually proved in the postseason. Due to their impressive performance all the way to the NCAA quarterfinals, both Cukierman and Smith were given ITA All-American honors showcasing the great work they put into this tumultuous season.
“I mean, me and Daniel, we definitely wanted to finish better than the quarterfinals, but we left it all out there. And that’s all you can do sometimes,” Smith said.

The 2020-21 volleyball season included a delayed start to the season, game cancellations and players unable to play due to coronavirus protocols, injuries and a rigorous 15 game schedule that featured only Pac-12 opponents.
Despite a 7-8 overall record, the Trojans finished last season by winning the last four games on their schedule — a streak that was sparked by a 3-2 win over nationally ranked UCLA in March. 
Senior Captain and All-American outside hitter Brooke Botkin will again lead the team after an individual 2020 campaign, in which she tallied 217 kills, 145 digs and 16 aces — all of which were team highs. Last season, she was named to the Pac-12 All-Conference Team. 
“Being a captain, I really want to lead my team by example,” Botkin said. “I want to put up good numbers every game. I want to allow myself to be a point scorer for this team. I want to lead people in the right direction. We set goals and values before every season. I want to lead by those.”
Senior Raquel Lázaro will also serve as a team captain this year. Lázaro is the team’s setter, and last season tallied 522 assists — 445 more than those on the team. She will continue to build on that number this season, and has high goals for the team as well.
“We have a very good team this year,” Lázaro said. “Playing unified will be one of our goals that we have to go for. We can definitely be top 4 in the National Championship. I really want to get there.” 
To get there, the Trojans will navigate a different schedule than last season — one that features out-of-conference opponents. Their first three games will be against Denver, Campbell and Cal State University,  Northridge. 
The marquee matchup will come Sept. 4 when the Trojans travel to face defending National Champion Kentucky in the Bluegrass Battle. The Wildcats dominated women’s volleyball last year, finishing with a 24-1 record, and streamrolling through the NCAA tournament to claim thenational title.
Head coach Brad Keller, who is entering his second season with the team, will look to get things back on track after posting a 7-8 record his first year.
“The goals for the season and the team will always be to play at the highest level possible and compete for national championships,” Keller said. “Last year was an anomaly for a lot of schools. [It] was more about getting the opportunity to play and be a normal human in some capacity, so there wasn’t a great representation from a lot of volleyball programs around the country.” 
But this season, Keller’s eyes are on the title. 
“This year, a lot of programs, including ourselves, are going to be back at what we’re wanting to do, which is compete at the highest level and go after National Championship opportunities,” he said.
USC’s first game of the season will tip off the three-day Trojan Invitational on Aug. 27 against Denver.

Heading into the Pac-12 Championship game last season, a win would’ve solidified the year as a massive step forward for USC Trojan football — an undefeated, Pac-12 winning season would’ve made a case for a College Football Playoff spot.
Those aspirations took a hit with the loss to Oregon, leaving the Trojans with nothing to show for the short season. Still, optimism floated around the program that wants to return to its glory years of the 2000s, and the fire was stoked even more after the Trojans landed a 2021 recruiting class ranked No. 7 in the nation. After the grind of the offseason, the team is ready to return to a packed Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
With turnover in personnel, here’s how USC could line up to start the 2021 season. 
Quarterback 
The QB spot is one of the few positions that won’t see turnover as junior Kedon Slovis will return as the signal caller for the Trojans. Shouts of a Heisman bid before the start of last season were met with underwhelming play at times, but there is no debate that when it mattered most, Slovis delivered. Slovis led game-winning drives in three of the five regular season games, most notably against UCLA.
Unfortunately, the defining moment of the season for Slovis was the late-game interception he threw in the Pac-12 Championship game against Oregon, a ball that should’ve been thrown away more convincingly but instead fell victim to a toe-tap sideline pick. There is still more to be desired from USC’s number nine, but the foundation is there. With another year of experience under his belt, he could be poised for a huge offensive season with his skillset. There were moments last season where he looked untouchable, and consistency will be Slovis’ biggest goal going into his junior season.
Running back
The revolving-door running back system last season was one of the big question marks that never quite got answered.
Then redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai led all rushers with 238 total yards, but his injury struggles prevented him from becoming the clear starting back. Alongside Malepeai, junior Kenan Christon will return to the team. This year’s new additions to the running-game include freshman four-star recruit Brandon Campbell from Katy, Texas, as well as transfers, such as senior Keaontay Ingram from the University of Texas and redshirt sophomore Darwin Barlow from Texas Christian University. While there isn’t an announced starter for week one, Malepeai will likely be a strong candidate given his experience and the promise he showed last season. 
Receivers
Last year’s wide receiving core was one of the strongest aspects of USC’s roster, but the NFL has now claimed Amon-Ra St. Brown and Tyler Vaughns, the number two and three receivers in terms of yardage for the Trojans last season. 
Junior Drake London will look to build on a breakout season and solidify his spot as the star wide receiver. Even with limited touches, redshirt sophomore Bru McCoy was one of the more promising players of last year’s campaign; however, it’s yet to be known whether he will be playing this season due to off-the-field issues surrounding his arrest July 24 related to suspicion of intimate partner violence. Other names to look out for include transfer junior Jake Smith from the University of Texas and four-star freshman Kyron Ware-Hudson from Mater Dei High School.
The tight end spot wasn’t a huge source of receiving yards for the Trojan’s last year. Redshirt senior Erik Krommenhoek will be the presumptive starter. Four-star recruit Michael Trigg, the fourth best tight end of the 2021 class, is also set to get some playing time.  
Offensive line 
The quality of the USC offensive line’s play over the 2020 season felt make-or-break for the offense as a whole.
Without a dominant run game, the pass protection needed to be locked down to give Slovis enough time to find his targets. The loss of No. 14 overall pick Alijah Vera-Tucker to the NFL draft will leave a huge hole to be filled on the Trojan offensive line, specifically at left tackle.
As the blindside protection, his replacement will need to be sturdy enough to give Slovis time for his routes to develop. This year’s corps is full of youth, as nine of the 22 offensive lineman on the roster are either true or redshirt freshmen. The veterans will most likely make up the majority of the starting five, with redshirt seniors Liam Jimmons, Brett Neilon and Andrew Vorhees receiving the most reps in spring camp. 
Front seven — defensive lineman and linebackers
In the recruiting sphere, the front seven was a huge area of success, most notably with the commitment of the No.1 overall recruit in the 2021 class, defensive lineman Korey Foreman. Other four-stars such as linebackers Raesjon Davis, Julien Simon and lineman Jay Toia will be useful players. The biggest losses for the front seven will be last season’s leading tackler and interceptor Talanoa Hufanga, who now resides with the San Francisco 49ers, and Marlon Tuipulotu, currently a Philadelphia Eagle.
Senior linebacker Kana’i Mauga and junior linebackers Drake Jackson and Ralen Goforth will be important returning pieces in both the pass rush and the run defense, looking to step up as Hufanga and Tuipulotu did last year. 
Secondary 
Shaky at times last season, pass coverage will need to be a point of improvement for USC.
With the loss of Olaijah Griffin to the NFL, players such as redshirt senior safety Isaiah Pola-Mao and junior cornerback Chris Steele are expected to become focal points of the secondary. The unit will receive a boost from the 2021 recruiting class, with four-star cornerbacks Ceyair Wright and Prophet Brown joining the team. Other notables include four-stars Calen Bullock and Anthony Beavers Jr. Both were not specified to be safeties in the recruiting process but have settled into the position. With a mix of youth and experience, the secondary has a chance to make a big leap in the 2021 season.

With the fall season approaching for many of USC’s athletic programs, the Daily Trojan met with Athletic Director Mike Bohn to discuss the department’s progression.
This interview was edited for length and clarity. 
Daily Trojan: You were athletic director at Colorado when they transitioned into the Pac-12. How are you using that experience to navigate the world that’s going on right now regarding potential realignment in the Pac-12?
Mike Bohn: I was certainly as surprised as everybody across the country when Texas and Oklahomaannounced the move — surprised in the sense of the timing and how that all was put together. But, I reflect back to when we joined the Pac-12 and recognize that it was really a process that was veryquiet and behind the scenes as well. So unfortunately, that’s how many of these pieces come together. And, again, we’re fortunate to have a great President that understands andappreciates intercollegiate athletics and has great relationships across the entire country that will bepivotal in helping not only USC but the Pac-12 look into all the different opportunities that exist.
D.T.: What are some changes you’ve made so far in your time at USC that aren’t necessarily directly related to something that’s on the field [or] on the court but something you’re still really proud of?
M.B.: The ability to bolster our medical partnership with [Keck Medical Center] is a big deal for us that we’re very, very proud of to ensure that all of our athletes, involving all 21 sports, are receiving the finest care from the award-winning doctors and staff at Keck. Being able to tie that in with Student Health on campus was a big, big hurdle for us and a big opportunity there. 
I’m thrilled that, again, President [Carol] Folt and Provost [Charles] Zukowski and I are co-chairing a committee working on the student-athlete experience. What does that mean? How are we doing everything we can to help our student athletes be all that they can be at USC? That’s about internships, starting with the admissions process, tutoring, jobs, all the great things that USC does. Think of the wonderful work [at] Marshall School of Business and Annenberg [School for Communication and Journalism]. We were able to start a new initiative in the summer, where our top faculty from Annenberg and Marshall provided engagement with our student athletes to talk about financial literacy to communication styles to building their brands to really trying to embrace the name, image and likeness piece. 
D.T.: I’m sure you’ve been asked about name, image and likeness so many times now, but how is that changing this competitive landscape as programs try to scramble to convince student-athletes they figured out a way to succeed in this new frontier?
M.B.: Well, certainly, it’s consistent with our vision. Our vision is to be the most student-athlete-centered program in the country. So obviously, if there’s an opportunity for a student athlete, I think people will be surprised how many opportunities are going to be available for our female athletes, which is terrific, we’re going to do everything we can to support them. I would be disingenuous if I didn’t share that I’m frustrated that we weren’t able to get a national bill through Congress or a more clear national structure from the NCAA. But that’s in process, and I recognize the pace that it’s put together there. We’re looking forward to continuing to do everything we can to support our athletes there and allow them to take advantage of what’s awesome about being a Trojan.
D.T.: What specifically is USC doing or preparing to do?
M.B.: We’re spending a lot of time educating our athletes and our coaches. I think that’s why I was a little frustrated with the timing out of Indianapolis associated with the ramp-up time to be able to help our athletes understand exactly what’s going on. Six hours before July 1, all of a sudden here were the guidelines that the NCAA put together, but it’s education, and we’re learning a lot about it. The communications group is across campus helping us with different pieces to ensure that we are all connected and all partnering to ensure that we can provide wonderful [opportunities] for our athletes to take advantage of. The wonderful prowess, visibility and stature of the USC Trojans.
D.T.: How is USC working to build its presence on social media, both in and outside of Southern California?
M.B.: I’ll have to get to the statistics specifically, but I believe that USC football’s number of viewers is the number one growth site in the country. I believe that we were the number one institution as far as percentage of increase, as well. So that gives you an idea of what our commiment is to that space, and that’s why we have staff that help with the graphics and building all those connections.
D.T.: Were you aware that Mark Trakh was going to retire? Or was that something that came out of nowhere?
M.B.: No, I think that Mark is a great professional and helped give a sense of all the different pieces. I think that the coronavirus timeframe and the coronavirus challenges really provided an opportunity for him to have clarity associated with what he wanted to do, and to be able to attract and partner with campus. Alan Green, our faculty athletic director is another partner that I haven’t talked about that just helped us with a search that produced an opportunity to bring in one of the brightest minds in all of basketball, for that matter. Particularly with her experience at Cal and Santa Barbara, as a head coach and what she learned from the NBA, Lindsay Gottlieb is an incredible talent and [has] a unique talent that just fits like a glove. It has been a joy to begin to build her staff and the tools and the resources around her that demonstrates our commitment to pursuing a national championship.
D.T.: Football head coach Clay Helton has been adamant that he loves USC because it’s a place where you’re expected to compete for championships. First, do you share that expectation? Second, what would you consider satisfactory progression this year in terms of the program?
M.B.: I certainly embrace that exact vision. I mean, that’s why I came here. I know that that’s why we were able to hire coaches like Coach Gottlieb. All of our head coaches understand the stature here. We won three national championships last year. I didn’t get a chance in our opening statement to talk about how awesome that was. All three of them were in women’s sports, but we clearly embrace the high expectations for Trojan football here. I’m looking forward to an exciting season. I know how hard these young men are working.
D.T.: I think it would be a good time to check on the athletic department’s progress in terms of social justice initiatives, action groups; what progress has been made? 
M.B.: I mean, there’s another one I missed. And doggone it, I talked about our guiding principles. We’ve hired a full-time diversity and equity [associate athletic director], Dr. Julie Rousseau, and she was an adjunct faculty member here. If you haven’t met her, she is a star. We have made significant progress there. I’m very pleased with the partnership with campus again with the United Black Student Athlete Association here at USC. Coupled with our efforts with the Trojan Athletic Senate and trying to provide some stronger structure and formality to the input of those senators representing all 21 teams is another significant piece of what we were able to put together. I don’t want to have to gloat about all the wonderful things that are happening. I am extremely proud of our partnerships and collaboration across campus that has allowed us to really, truly come out of [the coronavirus pandemic] stronger, more fundamentally sound and with more meaningful relationships across the entire campus and in the community than we really maybe thought we could.
In closing, what I’d like to say to our students is, you are the heartbeat of this university and of this athletic program. Your engagement, your participation and your membership as a part of our team is critical to our success. We invite you and welcome you to all of our events. We look forward to working with you in creating a Trojan experience that is very, very special to you, that will allow you to always lean on athletics as that opportunity to rally with your classmates and with alumni for the rest of your lives.

It’s the middle of February and men’s basketball is ranked first in the Pac-12. 
As Arizona State fights to stay in the game, the Galen Center, often filled with raucous noise, is suffocated to a quiet hush. 
Instead of Trojan fans in the stands, it’s cardboard cutouts. Instead of an electric atmosphere, it’s like a pickup game between friends.
The loudest voices in the arena aren’t the fans during the game, but a player, whose game is as loud as his personality. The curly-haired giant just extended the Trojans lead to five with a dunk over a Sun Devil defender and roared loud enough for the entire 213 to hear him.
He’s the player whose March Madness run catapulted the Trojans to the Elite Eight and the one USC will lean on this year.
A gifted athlete, he was simply born to play basketball. 
From AAU to No. 1 in California
Junior forward Isaiah Mobley has been playing basketball for as long as he could remember.
The son of former basketball players Eric and Nicol Mobley, Isaiah was introduced to the game early on. 
His first exposure to organized basketball came through the Amateur Athletic Union, playing on his dad’s team Triple Threat. In seventh grade, as he traveled across the country playing in various AAU tournaments, he figured something out: Basketball went from a hobby to a potential career. 
Mobley enrolled at Rancho Christian High School in Temecula. The addition of Mobley, along with his younger brother Evan, propelled the school into Division 1 play by Isaiah’s senior year. 
As a freshman, he didn’t waste any time making his mark on the program. 
Behind a 19 point, 16 rebound performance from Isaiah, Rancho Christian won their first CIF-SS championship and first in any sport. Isaiah shared Division 5A Player of the Year honors in 2016, making him the only freshman named player of the year across all men’s and women’s basketball divisions. 
Head coach Andy Enfield noticed his unique talent on both sides of the ball when recruiting him.
“[Isaiah] was very dynamic and versatile on offense,” Enfield said. “He was [a] very smart defender and had long arms and really affected the other team when he went to block shots or challenge shots.”
lready one of the top prospects in the country, Mobley joined the illustrious AAU team Compton Magic the summer after. Their 2018 squad became the AAU basketball circuit’s version of the 1992 Dream Team: Isaiah and Evan Mobley, Jarod Lucas and Johnny Juzang rounded out four of the five starters. 
All four reached the Sweet 16 of March Madness last season. 
“Being around such good players definitely elevated me. We all kept each other accountable. We all keep each other accountable still to this day,” Mobley said. “We’re all very close, and you always want to be the best. I’m a big competitor.”
His experience with Compton Magic took his game to the next level. 
Mobley ​​averaged 19.9 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks a game his junior year, leading Rancho to a 28-3 record. His senior year showed a list of triumphs, topped by being the only Californian to play in the McDonald’s All-American Game, that made him the No. 1 recruit in California. 
Energetic on the court, Mobley considers himself an extrovert “on and off the court.” 
“You can take him anywhere with any crowd, wherever it is and he’ll fit right in with them,” close friend and teammate Ethan Anderson said. “I feel like that translates to on the court to play alongside anybody.”
On the court, he’s the team’s and his own biggest cheerleader — the perfect teammate to have around. Louder than the squeaking sneakers of players, it’s become common for him to be the most rambunctious in the game not just by his voice, but his play too. 
“[I] just figured out what kind of works for me. Some people like to hype themselves up super, some people like coming to games real calm or antsy,” he said. “But as long as I prioritize having fun I let my instincts take over [and] I usually end up playing my best basketball.”
USC and March Madness
For Mobley, his freshman year got off to the bumpiest of starts. 
A Jones fracture led to surgery with Mobley missing close to five months and the Trojans’ entire preseason foreign tour. 
Mobley joined the team for fall camp but, the time off without basketball took a toll on him, and playing catch-up wasn’t easy.
His patience paid off as he was able to return in time for the season. A key contributor on the team, Mobley played in all 31 games. 
“He lost about three months of weightlifting and working out in the gym [because of the injury],” head coach Andy Enfield said. “I thought he did a great job of getting back as quickly as he could, helping our team his freshman year.”
Mobley finished the year gaining traction and “playing some of [his] best basketball,” before the pandemic put a wrench in everyone’s plans. 
With the time off between his freshman and sophomore season, another big change happened — his brother Evan joined the team. The Trojans got out to a fast start to the season, winning 18 of their first 21 games. 
Much can be attributed to Evan’s play, but Isaiah’s role was just as important. 
His bubbly personality can be deceiving but, Isaiah is a fearless player. It’s what Enfield loves about him, especially his 7-foot-3 wingspan that made USC one of the top defenses in the country last season. 
“He became our best post defender. He could guard bigger players as well as smaller players,” he said. “He was very versatile on the defensive end.” 
All his work came to light on the brightest stage in college basketball — March Madness.
The forward strummed a figurative guitar each time he splashed three after three. He looked away at the crowd each time he dropped dimes to his teammates for buckets. And he yelled as loud as he’s ever yelled each time he cocked back dunks to electrify his team and the crowd. 
Some might become more anxious playing games with larger implications. For Mobley, it was simple — he was enjoying the moment. 
If Evan is considered the unicorn talent in the family, Isaiah is certainly the swiss army knife. He demonstrated that in the biggest games of his career. And, for many, it wasn’t a surprise. 
“He was getting back to his old ways in terms of shooting the three off the dribble, and stuff like that,” Anderson said. 
Anderson played against Mobley in high school and has witnessed his growth up close. 
“He adds a spark to the game,” Anderson said. “Not only in scoring and doing the flashy stuff, but he also in college developed a knack for doing the stuff that really makes a difference, that doesn’t always show up on a stat sheet.”
When the games get tough, those little things can make a huge difference. The tournament was a display of his arsenal. He showcased the inside-out talent he’s been building for years. 
Most 6-10 forwards are stiff, terrified of the idea of stepping near the three-point line and handling the ball. Not Mobley — he’s a natural; something he credited his dad with helping. 
“My dad always made sure we played both inside and out growing up,” he said. “Keep practicing our skills no matter what position we’re playing. So if we had to go outside [we could do anything meaningful, inside we could do it as well].”
Following his breakout play, Mobley made a smart and cautious decision — declaring for the NBA Draft while keeping his eligibility open. He was invited to the draft combine and was “turning heads” with his play, according to 247 Sports. 
The experience turned out to beextremely valuable, he said. 
“It was really cool playing with such great players on my team and playing against and with [them],” Mobley said. “Just learning what it’s like at the NBA level I feel like I can take some of that and apply it to college.”
Even with impressive outings in scrimmages, the Los Angeles Times reported it was still unlikely for Mobley’s name to be called during the NBA Draft. Eventually, he made the choice to run it back another year in hopes of creating “a better body of work before [leaving].” 
With his return, the Trojans will be leaning heavily on the forward. Last year’s Elite Eight run was enough to satisfy longtime fans. 
However, the expectations are different now with Mobley taking on a role he hasn’t had so far. It’s clear he’s poised to have a breakout year.
“In the past few years, I’ve had roles I had to play in order for us to win. And I had no problem playing with [that],” he said. “But now I feel like this year, I can definitely show my whole bag with scoring, passing, playmaking, defense, everything.”

In the whirlwind that was 2020, we experienced a great deal of change in a relatively short amount of time. While there have been significant repercussions from the pandemic on a global scale, what do these developments mean for smaller, local areas? The Los Angeles area specifically has seen many known and loved restaurants close as new ones take their place and businesses shift their priorities to adapt to the new normal. Many LGBTQ+ businesses emphasize the importance of belonging and togetherness, along with providing excellent services and products. The idea of community has been especially important during the pandemic, but it is always something we can be empowered by — pandemic or not. So, as you relearn your new L.A. this semester, try stopping by one of these LGBTQ+ owned businesses. 
Nickel Diner
Located in the heart of L.A., the 40’s-era Nickel Diner has not only served countless meals but also the members of its Downtown community. During the coronavirus pandemic, the owners, Kristen Trattner and Monica May, worked with several organizations, such as Skid Row Housing and the Downtown Women’s Center, to provide meals for those in need. You can either visit their retro, red-brick storefront on South Main Street or donate online to help them feed people without housing. 
Liberation Coffee House
Liberation Coffee House is the newest addition to the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s intergenerational Culinary Arts program. The program spans several months and teaches LGBTQ+ people of all ages the skills necessary to work in the restaurant industry. Built on the center’s Anita May Rosenstein Campus, the brightly-colored café is staffed by graduates from the culinary program and funds many services that the center provides. Lined along the pink and yellow walls (accompanied by pink grouted tile counters) are benches and tables of all sizes that welcome visitors to enjoy the space.
n/soto
The sister-store to the famed n/naka, n/soto was created during the coronavirus pandemic by Niki Nakayama and Carole Iida-Nakayama. The couple’s restaurant is inspired by the Japanese word “soto,” or outside. While the pandemic forced us to become distanced, the two chefs at n/soto interpreted the word differently: “We hope to step outside of the familiar and welcome the opportunity to learn from the bigger world around us. We believe food can bring people together. It opens up new worlds and shapes our understanding of one another.”  As n/soto is not offering any dine-in options, but you can place an online bento box order.
Bloom and Plume Coffee
Bloom and Plume Coffee is another business that fosters togetherness. In their company story detailed online, they insist on being “not just a coffee shop, but a community oriented brand that wholeheartedly seeks to unite people.” Decorated by co-owner Maurice Harris — who also founded the floral company Bloom and Plume — the café is painted in a rich purple and covered in metallic mannequins sporting tees, totes and hats with the shop’s logo. Just beyond the large plant installation hanging over the front entrance are a few tables for outdoor seating that provide a spot to have a cup of coffee with friends. 
Little Barn Coffee House
Sitting squarely in the middle of a suburb in Glassell Park is Little Barn Coffee House. The Latina-owned business offers an entirely vegan menu and a spacious outside-eating area on the back patio. The patio houses several long tables and succulent centerpieces that circle a tree with ceramic windcatchers. These homey touches, along with the wooden picket fence that borders the area, makes it feel as if you’re eating in a friend’s backyard. 
The Ripped Bodice
“The Ripped Bodice is the only exclusively romance bookstore on the West Coast. The store is proudly Woman and Queer Owned.” If that statement alone has not already sold you on The Ripped Bodice’s appeal (and let’s be honest, how can it not?), it only gets better. The bookstore, owned by the Koch sisters, is full of antique bookshelves and cushioned chairs — a far cry from your corporate Barnes & Noble. They also conduct annual projects such as “The State of Racial Diversity in Romance Report,” where they track the yearly number of romance books written by Black and Indigenous authors and authors of color to help bring attention to marginalized voices. You can shop for books on their website or at their pink storefront in Culver City. 
Cuties(.com)
Although they closed their brick and mortar store during the pandemic, Cuties is still up and running. Like many things this past year, the coffee shop transitioned to a virtual space: hicuties.com. Their website, “a Black & queer-run virtual community space for LGBTQIA+ folks,” shares news on upcoming community events, fundraisers you can donate to, information about other LGBTQ+ businesses in the area and various activism resources. While Cuties may no longer hold a physical space, it continues to have a lasting presence.

Los Angeles county’s reopening on June 15 permitted restaurants to open at 100% capacity for indoor dining, relieving many who were financially impacted by the L.A. Department of Public Health’s restrictions. (However, masks are recommended regardless of vaccination status.)
Restaurant owners are now advancing with their plans to return to normalcy. The owners of Hotville Chicken, Holbox and With Love Market and Cafe spoke about their adaptation to change, the challenges the coronavirus inflicted and the value of face-to-face interaction with their customers. 
Hotville Chicken
Kim Prince, owner of Hotville Chicken, launched the Nashville Hot Chicken shack in Los Angeles about three months before the pandemic hit the country. The Prince family’s historic spicy fried chicken has been around since the 1930s and has migrated to the West thanks to social media.
When indoor dining was no longer a possibility, Prince made “a quick pivot” and partnered with UberEats — providing an exclusive online menu and third-party delivery service. 
“[When] I started off as a pop-up, social media was my main means of getting information out there that we were doing chicken in L.A.,” Prince said. “[It] seems to be one of the main ways that we’re finding a particular …niche of our customer base.”
Another boon to Hotville’s success was the public’s support of minority and women-owned small businesses in light of the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred last summer. Prince called the sudden publicity “a yo-yo effect” as sales rocketed. 
“Our adaptation has been to act like we’re a brand new restaurant. People are still finding us,” Prince said. “We’ve been adapting to what it’s like to truly market ourselves and make sure we get the exposure [to let] people know that we still exist and that we have indoor dining now.” 
Faith and family were Prince’s strongest motivators as she navigated a turbulent year as co-owner of the restaurant. Though Prince said her faith was surely “stretched,” the trait her and all her relatives shared saw her through: resilience. Prince preaches this perspective to her staff. 
“At Hotville, because we operate like a family, iron sharpens iron,” she said. “I feel like my staff is motivated because I’m motivated. They’re encouraged because they have some place to work that’s a positive environment.”
Prince’s motivation — stemming from her pride in her family’s legacy — is to make sure Hotville Chicken continues to prosper. She can now look back on 2020 and appreciate that Hotville managed to push through. 
More than anything, Hotville Chicken thrives on the familial atmosphere between the customers and employees. After all, dining at Hotville is meant to feel like being welcomed into a home.  
“Because, you know, [everybody] needs to walk out with a smile,” Prince said. “I want everybody to not only enjoy their meal, but enjoy their stay so they want to come back and we get lots of people that come back. So we’re winning in that regard. Definitely.”
Holbox
Holbox, located in community center Mercado La Paloma, serves a modern style of seafood influenced by the southern and coastal regions of Mexico. Holbox temporarily closed when the pandemic shut down indoor dining. Eventually, the business was forced to alter their typical dining experience to follow coronavirus guidelines.
To adapt to this new environment, their first step was mastering one important tool: technology. 
The Holbox website added an exclusive menu with family package meals and cook-at-home kits that were a great success. 
This virtual solution enabled a new path of opportunity for Holbox. In August, they will launch a partnership with nationwide platform, Goldbelly — an online marketplace that ships featured products from restaurants to people around the country. Customers will be able to order meal kits with instructions on how to assemble Holbox’s distinctive dishes. 
Chef and owner Gilberto Cetina expressed his gratitude for the steady business and the opportunity to learn how to better serve their customer base. By thinking about takeout service creatively, he discovered he could facilitate an unforgettable takeout experience just as special as being seated inside Holbox. 
“There is a newfound appreciation for being in the kitchen and interacting with guests, serving guests directly and collaborating with [the] team,” Cetina said. “So all of those things: the idea of coming in, and being able to cook and share my culture and my roots and where I come from with customers. That’s, I think, the main thing. It’s always been the main thing.” 
For now, Holbox will continue to develop their new home delivery and catering arms to offer a variety of options and services to their clientele. Eventually, they hope to open a second location in the future. 
“I think there’s a newfound joy in working, working hard, and having to work overtime some days that maybe wasn’t there before,” Cetina said. “As things are coming back and we start to feel the rush of busy services again, and that could be a thing. But just enjoying the day-to-day is what I’m enjoying the most right now.”
With Love Market & Cafe
With Love Market & Cafe is a community-owned business that addresses the needs of the Los Angeles populace. It provides access to healthy food, quality local jobs and a safe space for those in need. With Love has established itself as a “self-sustaining community, impactful social enterprise”.
The pandemic restricted several of their key core community outreach programs like free bilingual classes and food service. In response, grocery curbside pickup and home delivery became the center of With Love’s operations. 
“We started a bunch of food box programs, pay-it-forward programs where people could buy boxes of food with basic essentials for families in need.” With Love owner Andrew McDowell said. “We very much became a kind of hand-to-mouth service group, utilizing our grocery and our ability to source bulk products from different vendors.”
In spite of the difficulties coronavirus restrictions imposed, With Love refused to let the pandemic stop them from providing their staff consistent support and income.
“We told our staff, ‘Anybody that wants to keep working, we’re going to keep. We’re going to give you hours, [and] we’re going to make sure you get paid, so you can pay your bills’,” McDowell said. “We committed to all of our staff that [if] they wanted to stay, that [they] would have a job. So we never laid off one employee related to the pandemic.”
Listening to employees, community investors and customers allowed With Love to continue to be a safe space that could serve its community.
“‘How do we figure out how to invest, listen to the community and respond to meet the needs?’ … that really helped us pivot well because we asked a lot of questions and we listened to a lot of people, and that gave us a sense of where the needs were,” he said. 
McDowell is now working to transition back to prepared food and a safe environment for employees and customers to grocery shop and eat with minimal contact. He says “trying to create those safe spaces in our neighborhood [is] important.”
With Love has always been focused on how to best serve their neighbors in the community. Above all, they prioritize community impact to make lives better in any way they can.
“I think that people are beginning to realize that supporting your community is essential,” McDowell said. “The need and importance for supporting small businesses, specifically businesses that focus on your immediate community, is vital. It’s always been important, but I don’t think people were as aware of how important it [was] until the pandemic.”

Arden Rose Ricks, known professionally as Arden Rose, is an actress, author and overall charming 26-year-old Angeleno with impeccable taste in interior design, a skill she’ll be putting to use later this month.
“I just got some of the craziest news that I’ve ever gotten in my life: Your girl is in escrow. On a house — a house — with a roof and with bedrooms and a kitchen.”
Stomachs all over campus just tightened with envy. While most of us have signed leases on overpriced 750-square-foot apartments, this woman has an address all to herself.
“I know this is going to sound really obvious, but I am in such an incredibly privileged position, that this is even possible for me.”
Just how privileged is it exactly? According to Zillow, the average house in Los Angeles costs $882,000. That’s not including surprise expenses, taxes, fees, closing or maintenance costs. To put that into perspective: If a college graduate takes home $60,000 per year, it will take an estimated 14.5 years to save up enough money to make the down payment. And that’s assuming they’re putting away 20% of their earnings each year, something that becomes quite difficult if they have, say, student loans.
The Federal Reserve estimates that student debt shrinks GDP by roughly 0.05% per year. That number may look small, but as Millennials and eventually Zoomers struggle to buy homes, the impact is likely to become too tremendous to ignore.
“When a recession happens, the impacts are often uneven,” said Lindsay Owens, a sociologist at the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality. “These cohorts who are coming of age during economic downturns unfortunately experience [strong] negative economic impacts … It’s hard to get a good first job, [and] they are likely to get a job that’s maybe lower pay and lower quality than the job they would have gotten had they graduated a bit earlier.” 
The numbers support this claim: More than half of Americans under the age of 30 (so an estimated 40,000 students of USC’s 46,000) have either lost their job, been put on leave or had their hours cut as a result of the pandemic. When campuses shut down and classes migrated online, many sought refuge in their childhood bedrooms. That’s an enormous drag on the economy and on our self-esteem.
At this point, it seems as though our dreams of having a place to call our own have been trampled by a pandemic, recession and bespectacled economists. Millennials have been a notoriously unlucky generation; home ownership is merely one of the many casualties.
However, there’s a twist: Owning might not necessarily be better than renting.
Mountainous, chocolatiering Switzerland is often portrayed as the West’s ideal: They’re isolated from the world’s infighting and have national healthcare, accessible education and one of the world’s highest standards of living. Their homeownership rate is a measly 38%, the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, an organization consisting of 38 wealthy countries such as the U.S. and Canada.
There are several reasons for this, one being that renting allows for more mobility. Research has shown that, historically, an increase in American homeownership has been followed by a sharp increase in American unemployment. When the bulk of someone’s assets have been cemented to the ground, they are less likely — and less able — to move to find work. That probably explains why 88% of Millennials live in big cities like L.A.
Owner-hopefuls often argue: Both rent and a mortgage are paid by monthly dues, so why not take the mortgage? At the end, there’s glittering, glamorous ownership to show for all of that hard work.
Alas, that is simply not true. Aside from the astronomical cost of that initial down payment, a mortgage is only a fraction of what homeowners are responsible for. There are property taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance and, most importantly, interest, which fluctuates. Renters simply pay a flat monthly rate to a landlord: Snap, crackle, pop, transaction complete.
It gets better: One study revealed that only 9% of undergraduate students and 18% of graduate students live alone in the United States. The average rent in L.A. is $2,450, which may sound high, but considering that households with multiple roommates usually end up splitting furnishing costs, bills and maintenance fees, college students who choose to shack up with just one other person can save an estimated $800 per month.
“There are times when renting is a better deal, and there are times when home ownership is a better deal,” said Callum Williams, senior economics correspondent for The Economist who has written extensively on this topic. “Both theory and evidence suggest that renting and buying a property end up costing about the same amount over the long run. The idea that one is inherently better than the other is not true.”
Comparing rent to mortgage is like comparing a bicycle to a camel: They’re both forms of transportation — it’s just a matter of personal preference. Unfortunately, our ability to express that preference has been greatly restricted.
David Grusky, director of the Stanford Center on Inequality and Poverty, said in an interview with NBC: “Those who haven’t fared well under the existing set of arrangements tend to blame themselves. That’s part of the American self-reliance ethic. I think there has been [a] greater recognition that some of the problems that this generation has been experiencing are not due to individual failings, but rather to systemic ones.”
So these shoebox apartments in Echo Park and Filipinotown that we’re splitting with fellow classmates are not a consequence borne out of being too stupid or ordering a latte with almond milk instead of cheaper dairy. It’s our way of surviving the slings and arrows of an antiquated system and of best supporting the American economy. Good on us — and good on Arden Rose — for defying all odds.

I cheered as 17-year-old Alaskan swimmer Lydia Jacoby won gold, I laughed at the TikToks of Olympic rugby player Illona Maher and I admired gymnast Simone Biles, who bravely put her mental health first. 
This past summer, the Olympics provided me much-needed joy and triumph. Like most people, my love of the Olympics revolves around the athletes. However, athletes’ triumphant smiles as they cross the finish line and receive their glittering gold medals shouldn’t distract from their private struggles against the nonprofit behind the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee fails to protect and support its athletes. 
The IOC’s mission is “to promote Olympism around the world and lead the Olympic movement.” The nonprofit has an exclusive 15-member executive board that votes on legislation and regulations, but in total, there are 102 members in the organization, each representing different countries. Smaller nonprofits called National Olympic Committees exist underneath the IOC for different countries. NOCs, such as the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, prepare and select athletes for the Olympics. 
Unlike most nonprofits, the IOC does not receive donations or grants, instead relying primarily on broadcasting and licensing deals for money. NBC paid $7.7 billion for the broadcasting rights to show the Olympic Games through 2032, and the IOC is estimated to make $3 billion to $4 billion on the delayed 2020 Tokyo games.   
Although billions of dollars flow through the IOC, the organization invests little back into the athletes directly. Compared to professional leagues, in which athletes receive 50% of revenues, Olympic athletes receive less than 10%. Similarly, in 2016, the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee gave American athletes 8% of its revenues directly. The rest goes to what the IOC ambiguously refers to as “The Movement.” 
Despite allowing professional athletes to compete in the Games since 1986, the IOC treats athletes like amateurs who don’t train nor compete full-time. A lack of financial support made sense when participation in the Olympics was more akin to a hobby. However, the stakes have since risen and the pay should, too. 
Sanya Richards-Ross, a runner who won gold in the 2012 London Olympics, argues, “Everyone else — the IOC, the networks, and even the officials and support staff — is making money. The IOC doesn’t even award prize money for the gold medal.” Without support from the IOC, athletes must rely on the goodwill of friends, family and even strangers in order to compete. For example, the U.S. ski and snowboarding team needed a GoFundMe page to afford traveling to the Winter Games in South Korea. 
While I don’t expect the IOC to be able to pay all athletes a full-time salary for the four years leading up to their respective Games, my frustration lies with accounts of frivolous spending on the account of IOC members. Expendable money could be used for a better purpose.
For instance, Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who researches the IOC, found that although the IOC does not give excessive salaries, it does give excessive perks. 
In Switzerland, where the IOC is based, nonprofits don’t have to publicly disclose their finances. However, a few figures have emerged. Although most IOC members are considered volunteers, executive board members receive $900 daily on Olympic business, including the days before and after meetings to cover travel days. Regular IOC members receive $450 a day for meetings and at the Olympics. Although technically a volunteer, the IOC President receives a yearly “allowance” of $251,000 and lives rent-free in a five-star hotel and spa in Switzerland. 
The excessive perks trickle down to NOCs as well. The USOPC pays for first-class flights for both executive board members and their spouses. A former employee showed receipts of a $300 dinner for two and a $150 bottle of wine on the nonprofit’s dime.  
Instead of a ridiculously high-priced dinner, this money should go directly as scholarships and stipends to the Olympic athletes working multiple jobs in order to support their dreams. Or, this reallocation of money could be as simple as actually offering prize money for winning medals. The licensing deals surrounding athletes’ performances provide funding for the IOC and NOCs in the first place. Yet, athletes don’t see most of the money the IOC makes off of them. 
Aside from a lack of monetary support, the IOC and NOCs also fail to support athletes or protect them from harm. In 2019, Congress found that, despite many opportunities to take action, the USOPC did not protect young gymnasts against the sexual abuse of team doctor Larry Nassar. USOPC showed year after year that protecting their young gymnasts was not a top priority. 
Additionally, Becca Meyers, a paralympic swimmer who is deaf and blind, recently pulled out of the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics because the USOPC denied her request to have a personal care assistant in Japan. This assistant would have been helping her with the bus system, finding facilities and eating at the dining hall, yet the USOPC claims a personal assistant is not “essential” and therefore defies coronavirus protocol.
This past summer, the Olympic Games was undoubtedly a highlight. However, I can’t ignore that both the IOC and USOPC continuously prioritize money and their own success over athletes’ well-being. While I will continue to celebrate athletes’ accomplishments, the nonprofits behind the Olympics don’t deserve praise until they start putting their athletes first.

Most weekends, you can find me floating haphazardly in the lineup at El Porto beach in El Segundo — that is, when I’m not nosediving off my board or being pummeled by waves. However, I haven’t gotten much of a chance to show off my rather lacking surfing skills, thanks to recent events at the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant.
The treatment plant, for those of you who aren’t up to date on urban wastewater processing, is the oldest and largest treatment facility in Los Angeles. It is designed to accommodate a maximum daily flow of 450 million gallons of water per day during dry seasons and 800 million gallons during wet weather. 
If you’ve seen the critically acclaimed cinematic masterpiece “Finding Nemo,” you’ll understand the basic premise here: All drains lead to the ocean. While this explanation is rather simplistic — most drains leaving a grid-connected house or commercial building go to a sewage treatment plant like Hyperion or, if leaving a rural area, a septic holding tank where it will be drained at a later date — the fact of the matter is that most water ends up in the ocean at some point.
To break it down into simpler terms, sewage lines from all over the city feed into the facility, where solids and debris are first removed from wastewater. The water is then treated with chemicals to remove remaining solids and organic matter. Lastly, removed biosolids are broken down by bacteria in digesters, creating a methane gas that is captured and used to power much of the plant’s processes. 
Finally, the fully treated wastewater — or, in science terms, effluent — is discharged into the Santa Monica Bay. Try not to think too hard about your (treated!) toilet water flowing into the ocean — the chemicals do a good job of neutralizing potentially harmful bacteria, and the system used to be a whole lot worse. Up until the 90s, the plant was blending treated and untreated effluent and pumping it straight into the bay, causing serious environmental and public health issues. 
In mid-July, the Hyperion plant discharged 17 million gallons of untreated sewage into the ocean near Playa Del Rey, causing extremely elevated bacteria levels. The plant became overwhelmed by large quantities of inflowing debris, and engineers were forced to release untreated water as an emergency measure to prevent the plant from going entirely offline and potentially discharging even more sewage. 
While I’ve been avoiding the Wavestorm-filled haven of El Porto after the initial spill, water quality reports showed that things haven’t been necessarily progressing for the better. Bacteria levels have remained suspiciously high with several beaches in the area remaining under warning or even closed, although public health officials and Hyperion representatives have insisted that this was unrelated to the spill. 
Although daily ocean bacteria levels can fluctuate due to a variety of factors, it turns out that the plant has been continuously leaking sewage into the ocean post-spill and is still due for at least a month of additional repairs to stem the flow and repair damage. Residents of the El Segundo area have experienced headaches, rashes and burning eyes from inhaling the noxious fumes from combusting leftover digester gas. I plan to keep avoiding my usual L.A. surf spots for the time being, but I did go to my regularly scheduled sunset-watching at Dockweiler Beach this past week and can confirm — the beach smelled particularly pungent. 
Without getting too technical, there’s a whole host of bacteria-related issues that could come from swimming in the waters post-spill. Water filled with decaying organic debris can siphon oxygen from plant and marine species that need it to survive, and excessive nutrients can cause eutrophication, leading to algal blooms that further decrease O2 availability. 
While it’s likely that the elevated bacteria levels aren’t something that you’d notice while swimming — bacteria is, after all, microscopic — there are potential long-term human health consequences of floundering around in untreated wastewater. Bacteria and disease-ridden pathogens can contaminate water and shellfish populations, as can detrimental trace metals and other pharmaceuticals that would otherwise be processed out at a treatment facility. 
The situation with Hyperion is not unique. Let’s be honest — there’s a whole lot going on in ocean water. Naturally occurring marine and biological waste aside, there are constant transgressions when it comes to wastewater management and what ends up going to the sea. While water should be thoroughly cleaned and pass rigorous standards before it’s dumped, this isn’t always the case. Ultimately, sewage treatment plants need to take more responsibility when it comes to water resources and in this case, how to adequately process wastewater. 
In a perfect world, the best way to prevent long-term ocean pollution issues is to stop them before they happen by investing in more comprehensive wastewater management operations. However, accidents are inevitable and cities need to have contingency plans in place. The city of El Segundo is now offering vouchers for AC units and hotels to those residing near the plant should the smell of combusting methane get too unbearable, but the situation at Hyperion is a perfect example of the consequences of environmental unpreparedness and a lack of transparency. 
Not only did it initially take public health officials nearly a day to notify the public that the beaches were unsafe for recreation, but there was also a delay in offering financial compensation to local residents dealing with day-to-day inconveniences. As days passed and bacteria levels remained concerningly high, the plant also downplayed the severity of the incident. Accidents happen, but accountability is crucial. Providing clear, accurate and timely information and options to the community is the responsibility and obligation of municipal agencies, especially when there are dire public health consequences at risk. 
Let me leave you with a few parting words of wisdom to bring things full circle — if you’re planning to go swimming at a beach in the South Bay area these days, don’t be worried about what’s in the vaccine.

Aug. 23 will be a momentous occasion. In-person classes will resume for the first time since March 2020. To students, this may indicate a return to normalcy. However, it is now clear that our previous perception of “normal” has changed. 
The past 17 months have been trying times. The world continues to suffer under a pandemic, the likes of which have not been experienced since the early 1900s. The Black Lives Matter movement took center stage last summer and continues to play a vital role in shaping the future of this country. Just earlier this year, the Israel-Palestine conflict re-emerged to both the political and social forefront. Not to mention the fact that billionaires are currently racing to space while the Earth burns dry as a result of climate change. The fate of not only this country but the entire world is dependent on this upcoming generation. 
This means the brunt of finding the solutions to these matters falls on their laps as well. Not a single one of these issues is an overnight fix. Each requires persistence, time and stamina. As a result of literally the world’s problems bearing down on them, this generation will experience a grave emotional and mental toll. 
As a result, it may be hard for students to strictly focus on academics. Not a single person can gauge the emotional attachment and perspective of another with any one of these issues. With the emergence of BLM, some students feel empowered from the overwhelming support for Black people in their pursuit of political and social equality. However, others may feel uncomfortable due to inadequate action on behalf of the University. Each person’s life story is unique. Therefore, it is critical that students be respectful and supportive as each person deals with different issues in different ways. 
So, what exactly can we do? We must be willing to lend a helping hand. The university offers the chance to do exactly just that. Through Trojans Care 4 Trojans, students can anonymously help a fellow Trojan who may be battling personal difficulties. The University can then reach out to the struggling student with resources. 
There are also support groups available on campus. These collectives can be beneficial in building friendships and hearing from students who may share similar identities such as sexuality, ethnicity and gender. For instance, if one identifies as a Black woman, there is a support group for those with that same identity. 
Student organizations are also valuable for finding others with similar backgrounds or interests. For example, the Israel-Palestine conflict has highlighted issues of anti-semitism and anti-Palestinian rhetoric across society. If one is interested in supporting impacted students, they can join Students for Justice in Palestine At USC or The Jewish Social Work Caucus. 
Additionally, there are advocacy opportunities available in non-formal manners. USC’s Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs hosts seminars and round-table discussions. These forums act as a bridge between students and Black industry leaders, where the students can learn from both their professional and social experiences. 
USC also provides an array of counseling services, allowing students to pick ones they feel the most comfortable with. Students can talk to a counselor on Zoom for a private 30-minute conversation. If Zoom is not ideal, then it is also possible to schedule an in-person appointment to have one-on-one discussion with a counselor. Although these services tend to value short-term care over long-term solutions, they can still be valuable in aiding our mental health. 
Additionally, USC hosts a series of workshops where students can actively work through battling anxiety, relationship issues and other topics. In particular, these workshops can be really helpful given the fact that we are returning to campus after almost 17 months of virtual learning and isolation. While returning to in-person learning can feel intimidating, these workshops can equip us with the tools to stay strong. Simply put, a plethora of resources are offered by the University. 
Aside from just pointing toward professional guidance, students can approach others with an open mind and open heart. Recently, rapper DaBaby spewed homophobic slurs and verbally attacked those suffering from HIV/AIDs. Instead of reflecting upon his insensitive comments, he refused to take back his sentiment — until every music festival began to cut ties with him. Rather than just “cancelling” the rapper, Miley Cyrus offered to have a conversation with him via social media and respectfully educate him about the issues at hand. She wanted to hold him accountable and offer the opportunity to become better. 
We should aim to mirror this approach. It is necessary to hold others accountable when they incur harm upon marginalized groups. Whether that is within our friend circle or student organization, accountability is one of the best ways we can proactively invoke change. 
Therefore, we must not be steadfast in one perspective because, at the end of the day, it is only one. We must listen and learn from one another. There is nothing to gain from practicing ignorance; instead, it only adds to the already existing social divisiveness. Especially in trying times like these, it is vital to put our ego aside and be willing to understand each other. 
With that being said, it is often a difficult struggle to truly step out of one’s shoes and understand others, especially when their situation seems helpless. The innate desire to remain in our comfort zone can easily overtake the need to empathize with others. During these moments, we must remember that we are all a part of the Trojan family. Members of a family do not abandon each other in times of crisis. 
Therefore, each Trojan bears the responsibility to help another when they are in need. Family also means telling each other what we need to hear, not what we want to hear. In the Trojan family, we should strive to hold each other accountable and become the best versions of ourselves.

A middle-class Latinx couple, both teachers, live in the suburbs with two young adult children.
Their total annual income is over $110,000; consequently, they face the obstacle of not qualifying to receive adequate financial aid for their kids who attend college. The couple’s daughter spent four years at UC Davis and amassed over $35,000 of debt and will take out even more student loans to get her master’s degree. Meanwhile, their son was granted a scholarship at USC but has still taken out over $2,000 in student loans. 
This scenario is far from uncommon.
Middle-class Latinx students are graduating with significant debt because of high education costs, inadequate alternative financial routes, and lackluster government interference.  
Latinx students make up only 20% of all Pell Grant recipients, and the average debt they gather is $30,000 for federal and private loans. The median borrower still owes 80% of their debt 12 years after graduating, and 40% of those who at least have an associate’s degree still report having significant student loan debt. Alarmingly, middle-class Hispanics are disproportionately lagging on student loan payments in comparison to their white counterparts. 
The main issue is that half of the Latinx students who attend universities are the first in their families. According to the Postsecondary National Policy Institute, first-generation students come from a lower-median income household and have more unmet financial needs than students whose parents attended college. Thus, these individuals are more likely to receive financial assistance from the school and government. 
While this may initially sound positive due to more people of a particular marginalized community being able to further their education, the reality is that many Hispanic families make too much money to qualify for a Pell Grant but not enough to afford tuition, room, and board without loans. 
One can argue that it is more efficient and affordable to go to community colleges, where Latinos can obtain an equivalent education at a higher-learning institution. But there still exists a stigma that community colleges are nothing more than the impoverished man’s path to higher education.
A researcher at the Vanderbilt University Law School found that people who graduated from non-selective institutions earn less than those who attended prestigious schools for their graduate and undergraduate degrees. Therefore, diplomas from costly schools such as UCLA, UC Irvine, or Claremont College may increase students’ credibility in the career sector.
Moreover, specific community colleges have been cutting classes since 2007 due to budgeting issues. In California, where the state government has recently cut funding in education, an estimated 2.5 million students will be out of the system for several years. As a state with the largest Latinx population in the country, more than 800,000 Latinx students could be cut off. Essentially, it is paradoxical to encourage students to attend community colleges while simultaneously cutting their budgets. 
To not take out an abundant amount of loans, students are encouraged to join organizations such as the USC Army Reserve Officer Training Corps, a program that can pay tuition — including room and board — for two to four years. 
However, ROTC is a physically demanding and mentally brutal institution that only rewards a handful of individuals with substantial scholarships and requires eight years of military service after graduation. Furthermore, a university could redact its financial aid to students if they receive scholarships from other entities, further complicating the preconceived notion that ROTC is a simple solution to the student debt crisis. 
Ideally, an executive order from President Joe Biden to forgive student loans is a proper solution to the debt crisis. Since his inauguration, Biden has canceled $1.5 billion for some borrowers, primarily those defrauded by their schools. 
However, there is a possibility that a future administration could overturn such decisions. This potential solution fails to acknowledge rising higher education costs — which facilitate thousands of new loans to students — and decreased funding for public post-secondary education that contribute to the student debt crisis in the first place. 
Student loan debt is taxing, but alternative solutions have their drawbacks too. Instead of cutting funding to education, state governments should allocate more money to community colleges and vocational schools.
From 2009 to 2012, the state of Montana achieved the country’s highest rate of graduates with college degrees in proportion to its population. This was due to increased investments into four specific sectors: the state’s two-year community college system, which allowed schools to freeze tuition; additional online courses for students who do not want to do on-campus learning; dual enrollment programs for high schoolers and access to academic transfer credits, which made it easier to move from a two-year to a four-year college.
As a result, students took out fewer loans and had more control over their education. 
Another option is to re-federalize the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, which, under the watchful eye of the U.S. government, used to buy loans from the bank to lend more to students. A privatized Sallie Mae profited from government fees and paid colleges to sign up for their programs, forcing students to take out higher amounts of loans. They have since transferred their loan servicing operation to Navient, which overhauls 25% of all student loans in the country.
Ultimately, reforms must take place by a competent government to help middle-class Latinos alleviate their debt, and in the process, assist other Americans as well.

A big reason why I pursued studying the lives and physiology of older people was to fill a gap from my childhood. Growing up over 7,000 miles from my grandparents, I never experienced the surprise of finding their knitting supplies in cookie tins or hearing them reminisce about stories of the past. Yet, while I substituted those experiences with only tidbits and pieces that my parents were able to share with me, there is still a part of me that always juts out and asks the dreaded “what-ifs” — and that’s never fun.
Storytelling is a gift that has existed since the very foundations of human life, with the first instances of visual storytelling present in the caves of Lascaux and Chavaux, France. The stories that we share today, on the other hand, are most commonly seen through short clips online. Although not as visually appealing as cave paintings, the modern storytelling process spotlights an intergenerational nature and breaks down traditional family dynamics.
It goes without saying that the stories of older people have interestingly played a bigger role in our lives than we assume. They are often brought up in conversations or personal statements, such as the Common App, as a type of inspiration; after all, this column is based on that very idea.
The introduction of new social media platforms over the past decade has allowed for a rapid growth in the variety and frequency of storytelling, otherwise known as “content creation” for the purposes of this column. Granted, not all content on the internet is as emotionally moving as your grandparents or parents reminding you how they crossed oceans and climbed mountains to get to school, but the ability for younger people to share their stories and experiences paves a way for mutual, intergenerational understanding.
Sure, we did not have to trudge in a crocodile-infested river to get our diploma, but the challenges that developing adults face today may almost feel emotionally and mentally similar. Albeit, a dynamic job market emerging from a global pandemic in the midst of a climate crisis is pretty hefty to handle.
“But Lois,” you — the informed, inquisitive reader — ask. “Several older people have done those things too — look at major wars or sudden market crashes. What differentiates their experiences from those today?”
You’re absolutely right; every generational cohort has lived through some significant historical event that essentially serves as a marker for that group. Events such as the World Wars — hence Baby Boomers — or the moon landing can help demographers map out those general cohorts. In lieu of that, there are several historical and life-changing events that remind us that the more things change, the more they stay the same. However, the rampant expansion of digital media and content creation have dramatically changed the ways we receive and digest information.
The rapid transfer of information through the tap of a button is a simplification of the world we live in today. Therefore, stories that we learn about and share stem from all parts of the human lifespan. That does not mean we should totally disregard the lessons we learn from older adults, per se, but we have ample opportunities to take an original approach to key issues facing society today.
For instance, let’s look at the job market. We can recognize different stories across different age groups and evaluate how to improve hiring processes and workplace environments. Some older workers may be pushed aside by employers, considered to be liabilities or “old-fashioned” in the changing workplace. On the flip side, newcomers to the job market may be considered inexperienced or lazy in comparison to other age groups. Changing the way we approach those issues can dramatically improve workflow and chemistry in the workspace.
Unfortunately, conflict is a definite byproduct of looking for answers in several different places; sources of information across our lifespans will have different perspectives. Even when applying to college or graduate schools, we are bound to hear several different takes on the best way to get in — whether it be somehow making a Fortune 500 company at the age of 17, just taking an absurd amount of APs or just being yourself. At the end of the day, goals have a tendency to align but each person has their own journey with its respective twists and turns. That’s life.
I’m considering just doing a tl;dr — too long; didn’t read — because I have a tendency to babble on, but that’s beside the point. Simply said, storytelling is an artform that was often reserved and regarded for older adults given their wisdom and plethora of experiences. And that’s a totally justifiable and rational decision — science has backed the notion that older people demonstrate a greater deal of wisdom-related knowledge given decades-worth of life experiences. However, it’s critical to recognize that younger storytellers continually join those ranks to help highlight how society evolves with new ideas and trends.
At some point, we will probably be hearing stories from future cohorts on issues almost parallel to those we manage today as they think, “Back in my day …”

Most people don’t even know that social media is a section in a newsroom. And, for many, a shift in mindset may seem small — after all, maybe it is. But even this smallest shift of mindset can create space for us to better serve our readers and — in turn — our community.
The audience engagement space allows us to meet the moment — one where we spend more time on our phones and computers than we do in many other places in our lives.
With nearly 500 million tweets posted per day, including what our team adds to the already large figure, it felt intuitive at first to call these tweets the work of the Daily Trojan’s social media section. The former name, however, grossly oversimplified the work and overlooked what’s most important — the community.
This new space allows us to expand, humanize and bridge the gap between the newsroom and our audience. When we say we are by and for the students, we must take a step back and consider what that truly means. Our generation is a generation of the undefined and redefined. That’s what expanding our understanding of social media and news communication can do, too. It can bring transparency and access to news digital spaces as they grow and change.
The audience engagement section carries the pressure of navigating ever-changing algorithms to ensure that the work of our own writers finds its way to readers in these digital spaces and that our readers find the material they seek. As a result, crafting a 280-character tweet requires much more thought than you’d expect in order for it to not lose itself in the timelines of a vast audience.
Understanding this space can also help us counter the information overload we face every day and emphasize the difference between simply having information and being informed.
Especially this semester, during unprecedented times (which has become one of our least favorite words) we are committed to continue bringing the news to you.
We are also committed to tailoring the news in a way that acknowledges how every individual has their own identity within a broader community. As each reader craves something different, the challenge for us becomes communicating those demands to our writers and meeting them. We become messengers between the audience and the newsroom, attempting to deliver accessible pieces that, simultaneously, resonate with our audience and maintain their journalistic integrity.
According to a study by the Pew Research Center, over eight-in-10 Americans get their news via digital devices. So, when we talk about the importance of social media, the importance of responsible reporting and the importance of using new tools to reach new audiences, it all circles back to making news accessible and sharing stories that build empathy in our community.
As much as we find it amusing to say that our job is to tweet, it is more about giving journalism a purpose — we frame it for an audience in a way that initiates conversation. This connection between the content, the community and the publication is a driving force in why what was once called “social media” is now called “audience engagement.”
Anyone can post on social media and hope for the best. However, when there’s intention and craft behind it, those posts have the potential to live a life of their own and give the journalistic work its proper space in the world.
Social media is both a tool and a space, but in either of these definitions, it can be limiting. Audience engagement allows us to define our own arena.
Audience engagement acknowledges that we interact with readers and are able to make the social media void into something valuable for both ends — the newsroom and the audience. Our purpose then becomes bringing the publication and its creations to life, and for them to interact in ways that make readers care.
After a year where, for many, the spaces we occupied became smaller, we realized that it was important for us to make our reach bigger. We realized that journalism is an avenue for university accountability, but also community. And, by working to know our audience better, we could more accurately tell the stories that matter.
