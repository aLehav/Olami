Up in the Air ignores any statutes of limitation on making fun of the American economy and goes straight for the jugular — finding veins of comedy and drama within the plight of the American worker.
With a director like Jason Reitman at the helm, Up in the Air is hardly typical as satire, and, as the director has shown with his previous two films, he finds much more pleasure in studying the conflicted personality of an antihero rather than anything resembling a typical protagonist.

That antihero is Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a worn-down corporate axman who wanders from city to city performing layoffs. Ryan faces several crises. His comfortable lifestyle of living in airports and collecting frequent flyer miles is placed in jeopardy when a young co-worker suggests all firing be done over the phone. At the same time, he meets a woman just as detached from humanity as he is and finds himself falling for her.
While Reitman gave himself over to Diablo Cody’s vision for Juno, Up in the Air plays much closer to Thank You For Smoking, his first produced screenplay. Ryan is classically Reitman, a figure who is likeable despite his job and worldview ­— he gives darkly hilarious motivational speeches about the importance of jettisoning all personal connections — and entering his heavily-narrated, well-ordered world carries with it the same joy as Thank You For Smoking.
For all his looks and charm — and liberal sensibilities — Clooney plays the best conservative, white collar everyman in the business. His Ryan comes off like Michael Clayton with a dark sense of humor. Clooney is witty enough in the role, but his sheer likeability as a star gets in the way of Reitman’s essay about a man we are supposed to hate.
Opposite Clooney are two women: Anna Kendrick as his go-getter trainee Natalie and Vera Farmiga as Alex, the love interest. Clooney graciously hands every single scene to Kendrick, who just about walks away with the movie. She perfectly embodies a slightly older version of the obnoxiously overachieving student everybody knew in high school, and some of the film’s best comedy comes from stripping her control away and watching her spin out.
Up in the Air reaches for something far deeper than in anything Reitman has helmed before, but the director is not quite up to task as a storyteller to give his story the kind of emotional gravitas it so clearly yearns for.
Reitman, who has a background in improv and sketch comedy, is better at writing individual characters and scenes than fitting them all together into a cohesive narrative, and the film builds toward some shattering emotional moments that either come out of left field or seem unearned by the film’s lighter tone.
Up in the Air is really two films, both a play on the title. The first is the comedy about Ryan’s gradual and Frank Capra-esque realization that finding a real home might be preferable to his solitary life on the road. The second film is a tragic portrayal of the American economy, focusing on the uncertainty and malaise the average worker faces in the face of men like Ryan.
More than any of the twists and turns Ryan’s life takes, the heart and soul of Up in the Air comes from this story within the narrative. Ryan and Natalie fire a lot of people over the course of the film, and Reitman made the brilliant decision of casting recently fired non-actors out of Detroit and Saint Louis to play variations on themselves.
The film’s release is therefore perfectly timed, and a scene where Natalie is forced to fire a sobbing man through a computer screen  might be the single most emotionally resonant moment in any American film this year.
By focusing this second narrative around the humanization of a modern American villain like Ryan, Reitman lends comedy to the tragedy and tragedy to the comedy. The resulting tone is a bizarre yin and yang of comedy and drama that seems far less forced than the personal and professional quandaries — set to slightly more downbeat indie music — that Aaron Eckhart’s Nick Naylor faced in the more tonally-deficient Thank You For Smoking.
Up in the Air is funny — probably the director’s funniest movie — and has a heart, but it is not quite the show of maturity that Reitman clearly hoped it would be. Taking the American economy on was a bold and brilliant strategy, and it pays off some huge dividends, but Reitman needs to find a focus at a more basic level before his films can attain the kind of strong core that he is searching for.

Los Angeles is the future. Or, that’s what it used to be. Though the city is still part of the American myth of manifest destiny and upward mobility, Los Angeles is also part of a state that seems to be in a constant state of both disarray and innovation. Even the first introduction to the city  seems at once progressive and backward physically, culturally and spiritually.
Flying into Los Angeles International Airport is a strange, holy experience. The first glimmer of native architecture is the motif of powder-blue swimming pools and, once the jet has landed, the futuristic, alien-like structure of Encounter Bar & Restaurant, a Jetsons-like, geometric building that predicted that by the end of the 20th century we would be eating TV dinners on the moon.
The whole complex is a sad first greeting to a downtrodden population that wheels its luggage through the LAX terminals.
Even as visitors-cum-residents leave the airport, that same unsure progress-turned-digression unfolds. The traffic crawling on old roads debilitates a population that has depended on the fantasy of spontaneous, immediate movement as its very identity. An aging strip club sits next to a stainless steel Carl’s Jr.; modern, sleek hotels rest across from theme restaurants celebrating the golden age of flight.
Los Angeles constantly changes; it has been a wasteland of crime, a fantasy factory, technology hub and a cultural mosaic. But the city needs to realize that as the cultural and economical focus shift toward places like Downtown and the neighborhoods along the new Eastside Metro extension like Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles, the city needs to reckon with an identity forever in limbo. Despite the expanding public transportation and the effort to create a Downtown heart, we will never be the metropolis we have created in countless movies.
We feed into it wholeheartedly; the movie industry, which overwhelmingly fuels the area’s minds and wallets, has destroyed Los Angeles so many times at the contentment of outsiders everywhere: Volcano, Escape from LA and Independence Day punish Angelenos with natural and alien disasters. And Kurt Russell’s eye-patch.
Despite the ominous feelings of doom, Angelenos still seek an entirely old-fashioned way of predicting what is to come: fortune-telling, which, if any observant Angeleno knows, seems to have prime real estate throughout the area. As outdated as fortune-telling may seem, the residents and tourists alike still seek their local oracles for guidance.
One such business is hidden in the Old Chinatown Plaza, a neon outdoor plaza bustling with tourists, families and couples with matching nose piercings on a freakishly hot November Sunday afternoon.
The psychic at It Pun Fortune Readings sits in front of a small storefront chewing a piece of fluffy, white bread. He is the one clairvoyant, after speaking to one on Hill Street and another in the courtyard, that will allow me to pay a fee, listen to my future and let me take vigorous notes upon the subject for a story.
In a black suit and a camouflage army hat, he squints at me with his dark, old eyes and the wrinkles deepen on his face as he looks at my hands through a magnifying glass with a lens the size of an expensive steak and a handle with enough sterling silver to make a hefty sword.
For $10, he told me the following after I asked him what was in store for me as well as the city in which he has told fortunes for 19 years: I will have three children and I will marry my third boyfriend. I will live to see 103, thanks to a very long line down the outside edge of my hand. My best luck comes in the summertime, and my honesty is my truest asset. This was all recorded with his red Xs and Os on a set photocopied template: my future in shorthand.
Recording his prediction would change my destiny, according the first psychic I tried speaking to. By putting such supernatural talents on paper, I have the power to alter the universe’s energy against me, putting myself in a precarious position, ripe for a good heaping portion of bad luck.
My Sunday oracle was the representation of a Los Angeles caught between opposites; a city showing its age and steeped in uncertain tradition, but methodically looking toward a limitless future. He was an LA transplant who found wealth through reinvention through storytelling and gumption, practicing an art of the past by seeing what is to come.
He still didn’t tell me what fate has in store for the city he lives and works in, but rather nodded, smiled and handed me my photocopy as he returned to his roll.
In a city where luck and hard work lives next to the commercial yet creative, and the archaic but contemporary combine, you never know what to expect next.

James Cameron’s upcoming film Avatar tells the story of a human who comes to live within an alien race known as the Na’vi, eventually becoming a human-Na’vi hybrid know as an avatar.
For professor Paul Frommer — who created the Na’vi language for the film — the idea of living as part of two very different worlds is something he is also familiar with.
The interpreter · Professor Paul Frommer created the Na’vi language for James Cameron’s latest film, Avatar. - James Watson | Daily Trojan
Frommer, a longtime faculty member at the Marshall School of Business who is also a linguistics specialist, conceived an entirely new language to be spoken by the Na’vi that inhabit the planet Pandora in the film.
To craft a new language, Cameron turned to the USC College of Arts and Letters’ Department of Linguistics in 2005, which recommended Frommer for the job. Two weeks later, Cameron and Frommer sat down to talk about the possibilities. Frommer joined the production team that same day.
“He wanted a complete language, with a consistent sound system [phonology], word-building rules [morphology], rules for putting words together into phrases and sentences [syntax] and a vocabulary [lexicon]  sufficient for the needs of the script,” Frommer said. “He also wanted the language to be pleasant sounding and appealing to the audience.”
Frommer, who co-authored the book Looking at Languages: A Workbook in Elementary Linguistics — which includes data from 30 different languages — said he found the opportunity challenging yet incredibly fascinating.
For the next four years, Frommer worked on creating a language that sounded complicated but was also engaging.
“I didn’t quite start from zero, since Cameron had devised 30 or 40 words of his own for the original script — some character names, place names, names of animals, etc.” Frommer said. “That gave me a bit of a sense of what kinds of sounds he had in mind.”
Frommer created three different sonic impressions of the language that included many sounds uncommon in Western languages, known as “ejectives,” which are popping-like sounds that come from the glottis in the larynx. He also made sure to include distinctive elements that differentiate his language from others. Cameron chose one, and the rest of the conception was up to Frommer.
He then created the morphology and syntax.
“The verbal morphology, for example, is achieved exclusively through infixes, which are less common than prefixes and suffixes,” he said. “And the nouns have a system of case marking, known as a tripartite system, that’s possible but quite rare in human languages.”
Once the basics of the language were initially conceived, Frommer, who holds a Ph.D. in linguistics from USC, combined his expertise with the likes of Hollywood and in many ways became an avatar himself: an academic-Hollywood hybrid, who then found himself working on an actual film set.
Frommer worked with many of the film’s stars, including Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver, and coached their progress with the pronunciation as well as observed instances on set that required rewrites.
“There were long stretches of boredom punctuated by instances of terror,” he said, in regard to changes in the script that would often require his immediate help.
His language also caught on with many of the production crew, who all seemed to easily adapt and pronounce the Na’vi word “Skxawng;” its “kx” popping sound translates into English as “moron.”
Amidst all of the momentum required for a film with a monstrous budget like Avatar, Frommer found the most thrilling opportunity of working on a film set to be the time spent perfecting the language.
Although Frommer is the only one who completely understands the language, it’s possible it could catch on in popular culture is quite high, similar to the longevity of the Klingon language of Star Trek —  which is the gold standard for sci-fi languages according to Frommer.
“There’s even a translation of Hamlet into Klingon,” Frommer said. “If Na’vi ever came close to that kind of following, I’d be delighted.”
Knowing Cameron and significantly contributing to one of the most anticipated films in recent years might sound perfect to would-be filmmakers, but for a man fascinated by verbal communication, the real glory comes with his creation of a living language.

In the summer of 2007, Brad Bores, Rich Hooban and two other idealistic filmmaker friends piled into a 1988 Caprice Classic with an Eclair 16mm camera and drove from Ohio to New Mexico filming Soda Can Love. For two weeks, the crew took turns acting (as versions of themselves), filming (on re-canned stock) and watching for police (no permits here!) as they filmed the real-life encounters and unpredictable emotions found on the road. The result was raw, compelling and pure, exactly how Bores had envisioned.
But most film festivals weren’t interested in Soda Can Love or its impressive DIY back story.

“You buy into these ideas that if you make a good film, Sundance is going to show it and you’re going to sign a distribution deal and start your career,” Bores said. “Maybe it was like that at some point a long time ago, but it just doesn’t exist as much now.”
After Hooban encountered similar problems finding outlets for his self-funded project — “We were rejected by too many film festivals to count,” Bores said — the two disgruntled friends realized even festivals that stand for independence had gone off course.
So they maxed out the last of their credit cards, put out a call for submissions and created Zero Film Festival, a “for us by us” forum for truly independent cinema.
“We just had a hunch that there were more filmmakers like us going through the same struggles,” Bores said. “We said, ‘Let’s start something — let’s embrace those films.’”
With no previous festival planning experience and nothing to lose but their credit scores, then-LA-based Bores and Hooban took a bold stance against the independent film festival status quo with last year’s inaugural ZFF. The four-day, five-venue underground movie extravaganza disregarded big-money investors and B-list actors in lieu of self-financed masterpieces from only the most passionate filmmakers.
Utilizing a side of the city as opposite to Hollywood as the films in its program, ZFF took over Downtown LA warehouses and revival theaters, screening everything from experimental Italian shorts and one-take British mumblecore to narrative features developed with hand-extracted battery acid.
The showcases were paired with music-fueled after-parties, where equally-as-independent local bands (such as Warpaint and RESTAVRANT) played until the free drinks ran out.
“Last year was fun for everybody because nobody knew what to expect,” Bores said. “We had no idea how it would be received.”
But 2008’s ZFF did more than attract just a few free-film thinkers. Although Bores and Hooban knew their festival would appeal to a niche of independent moviemakers, they underestimated how much an event like theirs was needed.
After taking the films on a miniature West Coast tour this past spring — and noticing a “no-budget” category popping up on Sundance’s entry form — the two realized that ZFF was forming a reputation big enough to influence the festival world they left behind.
“I think we’ve made them re-assess their roles and their whole mission,” Bores said. “What has been defined as ‘independent’ really isn’t, and we’re coming in to clean that up.”
Knowing that other festivals are catching up to their purist ideals only motivates Bores and Hooban more. Refusing to let ZFF’s main objectives be overshadowed by larger institutions’ copycat attempts, this year’s festival — affectionately known as ZERO9 — is the most ambitious yet.
After personally watching over 600 entries (and reading every line of every heart-pouring cover letter), the two organizers settled on 115 new underappreciated films that will be shown not only in Los Angeles, but also at the first New York ZFF, held next week in Brooklyn, NY.
While ZFF’s unexpected impact proves the meaning of “independent film” is still in flux, so is the definition of what makes a “zero” film. The movies screening this year are in line with Bores and Hooban’s original vision of exposing dedicated filmmakers, but they also represent a looser interpretation than last year — one that doesn’t necessarily exclude larger-budget or award-winning pictures.
“It’s Zero Film Fest, but it’s not that you have to go out and shoot the film for pennies. It’s about not letting the financial side paint the vision,” Bores said. “We’re looking for a level of purity in the work — it’s as simple as that. We want to know that this is something that they, as an artist, have really put their heart and soul into.”
With that in mind, this years expanded lineup includes visual art from working fine artists, experimental music videos,  hand-animated shorts and a block of activist films addressing important global issues (like the commodity of bottled water).
Other highlights include a renegade Afghan documentary by the Razzie-award winning director of Xanadu, an evening of shorts filmed by a group of Echo Park high schoolers and a George-A.-Romero-meets-Boris-Karloff throwback zombie flick that was made for only $75 (and hailed at Cannes).
In addition to five-day events in both Los Angeles and New York, this year’s enhanced ZFF is spending the upcoming spring on an international tour with over 20 North American dates and even more in Europe, giving cinephiles worldwide a chance to experience the next generation of moviemaking zealots.
While films such as Precious and Paranormal Activity are using their low-budgets as a marketing tool for mainstream success, ZFF is continuing to cultivate a modest co-op where investors and B-list actors mean nothing compared to the blood, sweat and tears of those who dreamed it.
“It’s really crazy to think that a year and a half ago, Rich and I were disgruntled filmmakers and we had no community like we do now,” Bores said. “We have the biggest, craziest goals; we want to change the world of independent film.”

“We’ve found there is a marvelous release of intellectual energy that occurs when two widely separated fields of thought come together in one mind,” President Steven B. Sample writes in a guide to prospective students.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
In a nutshell, Sample is describing what he believes distinguishes a USC education from others. The emphasis on well-rounded students is the mission that USC focuses on — developing its students through exposure to a vast array of disciplines and subjects.
The university aims to achieve interdisciplinary “breadth with depth” through the core curriculum, consisting of general education courses, a diversity course and a writing requirement. The curriculum encourages students to be inquisitive about a variety of subjects and to not leave important disciplines unexplored.
But although the core curriculum encourages students to approach topics outside their field of study, the lack of cohesion between courses diminishes their impact. If the core curriculum was offered as a package, as opposed to a scattering of random courses, students would be more receptive to taking courses outside their major.
Many students go through college with the mindset that the education they’re receiving is a means to an end. Because of this, students might not see the point of taking classes outside their specific field of study. Learning about Russian literature might seem futile for someone pursuing career on Wall Street, especially when students are already stretched thin by their major coursework.
The purpose of the  general education requirement is to provide students with more knowledge than their major offers.
“A general education is a crucial part of the undergraduate experience,” said Thomas Habinek, a professor of classics. “It’s a good balance to the students’ tendency to specialize early. It gives them a sense of the bigger picture.”
But when students are bogged down by rigorous majors and extracurricular commitments, courses like the GEs are often relegated to the back burner, which ends up fostering an attitude of apathy about these classes.
“I think a lot of students are not open-minded about taking other courses,” said Abel Delgado Fuentes, a sophomore majoring in accounting and history. “Or they don’t really care about courses that are not related to their major.”
The core curriculum has obvious benefits. Because USC offers a wide variety of general education courses, it provides the “breadth” that Sample wants. And many students feel that the program does work toward forming well-rounded students.
The general education system also facilitates an easy transition from high school to college.
“The students I teach in general education [courses] are very, very bright, but they are not being taught critical, creative thinking in high school,” Banner said. “I think that the course I teach opens them up to very new ideas when they immediately get to USC.”
But providing disparate subjects without stimulating students to form a common thread defeats the purpose of the core curriculum.
“Having knowledge about many different subjects is all well and good, but they aren’t connected at all,” said Matthew Fagre, a sophomore majoring in international relations.
Fagre and others said there should be a common base between the GEs, similar to the Thematic Option curriculum. TO students fulfill their core curriculum though a package of cross-disciplinary classes that often share subject matter. Linking general education courses like this eradicates the notion that GEs are simply requirements to fulfill.
“There is lots of overlap between material in TO classes because of this base,” Fagre said. “For example, I’ve studied or read Freud in my TO classes on cultures, political thought and neuroscience. So they are all connected at a base level in some way.”
Breadth with depth is an admirable goal, and one that USC has made its hallmark. Unfortunately, a component of the core program is lacking. By revising the curriculum, USC can convince its students that a broad-based education has benefits.
It’s one thing to simply take classes in oceanography, family history and gender conflict. It’s a completely different thing to spark in students a true “passion for learning,” as the curriculum seeks to accomplish.
Nadine Tan is a sophomore majoring in business administration.
So…let me get this right…your thesis is NOT that the “GE core is overly broad” as the title suggests, but rather that “the core curriculum [should be] offered as a package, as opposed to a scattering of random courses.” Where did you argue, exactly, that the curriculum was too broad? I thought you spent the whole article arguing that it was a good thing. Odd choice of a title…where are your editors?

On Tuesday, President Barack Obama addressed the nation from US Military Academy at West Point regarding his plan to end the war in Afghanistan.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
In the midst of rising unemployment, historic deficits and a new health care system, Americans listened attentively to the president’s words in search of an answer for why they should still be focused on a war that has lasted eight years.
The commander in chief tried to convince Americans to hold on, but his speech left many questions unanswered.
Al-Qaida still poses  a real threat, though the Washington Post reported recently that there are only an estimated 100 members left in Afghanistan. Obama didn’t try to belie the gravity of the situation.
But with so much speculation about the next step, the president still hasn’t convinced the public that the end justifies the means.
Asking for $30 billion more per year to fund a war that’s already cost $172 billion as of April is a tall order and  leaves the nation wondering: With all our overwhelming domestic problems, at what point do we cut our losses?
Health care reform, expected to be approved in the coming month, will run the nation $850 billion over 10 years, a staggering number considering the nation’s $1.4-trillion deficit. Compound that with multibillion-dollar bailouts for the Bank of Americas, GMs and Freddie Macs of the world, and the public has reason to be wary of the expenses.
But the truth is, despite the staggering prices of bailouts and reforms, the spending is necessary to sustain and change the American infrastructure.
The same can’t be said for expenses in Afghanistan. At some point, enough is enough.
Obama undoubtedly understands the implications of an escalated front. He wisely chose an audience full of the men and women whom he is asking to fight overseas. But the public must have full confidence in Obama if the war is to move forward — support he didn’t garner with his speech Tuesday evening.
First of all, where do we get the money? Do we fund the war with a progressive tax, or do we freeze other spending and allocate funds away from projects such as the $787 billion stimulus package passed in February? Financing, though, isn’t the only question. His plan still has many holes.
For example, why does the commander in chief plan on deploying only 30,000 more troops, when Gen. Stanley McChrystal said that a minimum of 40,000 troops were needed to succeed in Afghanistan.
It makes even less sense that Obama would set a deadline to withdraw troops by July 2011. If success in Afghanistan is that critical, why force our way out if we fail? The Afghanistan government is not yet fully stable after eight long years. How is it going to improve so dramatically in just two?
Although a final date helps citizens keep the end in sight and reminds Afghan President Hamid Karzai that America will only be around for so long, there is a real possibility that two years won’t be long enough.
Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) remark that, “The way that you win wars is you break the enemy’s will, not announce when you are leaving,” is more rational. Sure enough, Obama is losing support from anti-war Democrats convinced that he’s digging himself deeper into a hole and still pretending China is on the other side.
Whether or not the allocations of troops will ultimately prove to be the correct choice, Obama left many questions unanswered by the time he stepped away from the podium.
Robert Fragoza is a junior majoring in chemical engineering. His column, “Reality Check,” ran Fridays.
It is time to pull out of Afghanistan and Iraq!  Bring our boys home and give us all the health care we deserve now!  The money wasted by our goverment trying to kill innocent people will pay for quailty health care for all of us.  We all voted for Obama to get us out of these Hell Holes!  Obama, please stick to your campaign promises and dismantel the BCS system now!  There has to be a better system that doesn’t favor the SEC.
Fragoza, you’re right on the money with most of this article. Obama is clearly faking it here, with his speech full of contradictions. Victory is absolutely critical, but we’re going to quit in two years whether we win or lose. This is a war of necessity, but we aren’t sure if the cost is justified. Karzai is hopelessly corrupt, and he is just the right man for this alliance. We’re sending 30,000 troops and building a counterinsurgency strategy based on making the people know they can trust us… but we’re also telling the Taliban exactly when they can begin moving back into power.
You blew it by interjecting a lunatic opinion without any sort of evidene to back it up: “But the truth is, despite the staggering prices of bailouts and reforms, the spending is necessary to sustain and change the American infrastructure. The same can’t be said for expenses in Afghanistan.” The article would have been better if you’d just left it out. Or you could do what the professionals at the big liberal rags do: find somebody other than yourself to make that statement, and then quote them.
I must say I was insulted by the President’s speech.
The issue is not a bunch of people running around some hills in the middle of Asia.
The issue is the people that read the Wall Street Journal, NY Times, and others whio want to do this nation ill.
It is the money people who pay the bills of others that are the real ememies.
I would hope the President gets real on this issue.  As I see it the president is playing “Lets you and him fight”.

Current Interfraternity Council board members are hoping the new board, which will be elected Wednesday, will continue to emphasize scholarship and build on some of this year’s new programs.
The current board has officially recommended candidates for each board position, but these slated candidates are expected to face competition.
The slated executive board candidates, chosen after more than 10 hours of interviews, are Alex Bozzo, recommended for president, Derek Carmack, recommended for executive vice president of administrative affairs and Brad Head, recommended for executive vice president of judicial affairs.
All candidates will have a chance to give speeches at tonight’s elections, and then each chapter president will cast his vote. Chapter presidents are told beforehand who the slated candidates are.
“There will be challenges; there always are. Those that weren’t slated are eligible to challenge and run from the floor,” said Nick Hamada, current IFC president. “Ultimately the chapter presidents will vote, and they may or may not follow the slate.”
Though uncommon, challengers occasionally beat out the recommended candidates.
Hamada said the board was careful in choosing its slated candidates.
“We put so much effort on this side of it to make sure that we slate the most qualified candidates and then hopefully elect the most qualified, dedicated and talented candidates, so then we’re in good hands,” Hamada said.
Hamada said he hopes the new board members, once elected, will remain committed to the overall Greek experience. He wants the board to both chart its own course and continue existing programs and traditions, including the IFC Philanthropy Grant Program and the all-Greek service days, both of which started this year.
Aaron Rizkalla, current IFC vice president of scholarship and slated candidate for the position of vice president of finance, said he hopes to continue encouraging Greek academic success and ensure that IFC has the funds needed to continue scholarships and service events.
“I wanted to be on the board to continue my legacy, and work on transitioning whoever my successor is,” Rizkalla said. “It’s about being able to take the experiences I had, and then also help with financing and allocating the budget.”
Brad Head, current IFC vice president of rush and the recommended candidate for executive vice president of judicial, said he intends to continue striving to improve Greek safety and cooperation.
“One of the biggest things I learned was that the key to a successful IFC board was its relationships — whether it be with DPS and with the chapter presidents,” Head said. “It’s also maintaining a level of transparency, where everyone sees what IFC is doing and understands the benefit of what we are trying to do.”
Hamada agreed that the safety issue will be an important task for the new board to deal with.
“We need to continue sound risk-management policies,” Hamada said. “We are being vigilant about them and even creative about finding new and better ways to make our community safer.”

Sometimes, USC’s campus can look like a billboard for large companies. Most recently, Nissan LEAF shirts were prevalent across campus after Nissan launched a promotional campaign on Trousdale Parkway.
But the company says it and others like it are targeting students for their expansive social networks — which ultimately help companies pad their bottom lines.
Big business · Nissan representatives tell a student about the new LEAF. Nissan teamed with a Marshall group to come to campus. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“They are reaching a sweet spot of their target audience, which is 18- to 22-year-olds,” said Ira Kalb,  professor of marketing. “That group also talks a lot on social networking. You get this accelerator effect where [students] all start this word- of mouth pyramid through Facebook and other social networking avenues.”
But appearing on USC’s campus is not an easy task. To do so, the company must have the sponsorship of a student organization, a university department or USG’s Program Board, according to Heather Larabee, director of campus affairs.
The marketing endeavor must also be tied to a special event, such as Conquest. Final approval rests with Campus Activities and the Scheduling Office.
Nissan, which was recently on campus to promote the Nissan LEAF — its unreleased zero-emissions car — collaborated with the USC student group Marshall Net Impact, which focuses on ethically responsible business practices. The stop at USC was part of Nissan’s tour focusing on environmental impact. A quarter of the tour’s stops were at university campuses, part of its efforts to pursue a more socially active audience, according to Tim Gallagher, manager of west coast communications.
“We know universities are really a bed of social media,” Gallagher said. “When we talk to students it’s kind of like we’re talking to 10 times as many people because they have the ability to socially outreach through electronic means via Twitter or Facebook.
Gallagher said the promotional events are not about actually selling the product, but about getting the message out.
“We just wanted people to know about the topic, people to know about the products that were coming and to start the dialogue, she said. “Of course we’re going to benefit from showing the car and having the Nissan logo there, but it really sincerely was more about the dialogue.”
But companies are not the only ones benefiting from marketing on campus, Kalb said. Advertisers can also help give students interested in marketing an up-close look at how companies promote and market.
“The way USC is set up is that students who do well and are successful, after they graduate they give money back to the school,” Kalb said. “Anything that helps students or vendors helps the school. It all works together.”
Larabee said letting companies advertise on campus is relatively common at universities. Still, students had mixed reactions. Some said they liked having access to these large companies, but others said the aggressive marketing can be annoying.
Austen Courter, a sophomore majoring in vocal performance, said she thinks big brand efforts such as Roxy Clothing, a retail brand that has advertised on campus, are great for students who don’t have cars, because the companies make the products accessible. But she said there are times when it can be too much.
“It’s kind of annoying, because I hate having people harass me,” Courter said. “But I guess it’s good for marketing students to learn marketing techniques.”
Daren Flam, a sophomore majoring in communication, prefers the public relations-oriented company promotions, such as the recent AT&T tent, as opposed to the sellers along Trousdale.
“That’s the way it should be, as long as they aren’t hawking anything,” Flam said. “I’m here to learn, not be heckled by vendors. They should wait for me to approach them.”

At their final meeting of the fall semester Tuesday night, Undergraduate Student Government senators passed several resolutions targeting student life, USG’s website and communication between the student body and the university administration.
A resolution endorsing the full closure of the Row to through traffic passed unanimously. USG had been discussing the resolution since Greek senators resurrected the idea of blocking off the Row at the beginning of the year.
“It shows that Undergraduate Student Government supports the development of 28th Street,” Greek Senator Hayden Coplen said. “We’re not city planners, so I can’t speak to having a solidified plan, but the goal is that we don’t want through traffic on 28th Street because it’s dangerous for pedestrians and bike riders.”
Closing the Row would involve installing gates or guarded kiosk entrances at both ends of 28th Street, and only Department of Public Safety, Campus Cruiser, taxi and emergency vehicles would be granted access.
Despite the Senate support for the resolution, students have expressed concerns about the effects of closing 28th Street to traffic.
Many students who completed a USG-sponsored survey about the development of the Row expressed concerns about limited parking and emergency vehicle access to 28th Street, but USG will address these issues if and when a more specific plan is outlined, Greek Senator Dylan Dann said.
Limiting traffic on the Row has been one of the Greek community’s primary objectives for many years, Greek Senator Max Ukropina said. But the issue affects both Greek and non-Greek students, especially in terms of the Row’s safety and cleanliness, he added.
Although the 28th Street resolution only focuses on limiting traffic, the measure will help pave the way for future efforts to develop and improve the aesthetics of the Row, which is another concern that has been raised, Dann said.
“The whole project is an initiative to improve 28th Street as an extension of the campus, because alumni [and] a lot of big donors associate 28th Street with the university, and [the images are] not consistent,” he said.
Aside from the 28th Street initiative, the Senate also approved a resolution calling for the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate student representatives on the Presidential Search Advisory Committee.
The senate also allocated $2,200 for the creation of an online funding application on USG’s website and passed a resolution for the establishment of a USC Trojan Toilet Task Force, which will be responsible for establishing a guide to the locations and amenities of bathrooms on campus.
The row closing to external traffic is not elitist- far more than just the Greek community uses the row; Thursday nights are packed with non-Greeks hanging out there with their Greek friends.
Secondly, the way a resolution works, which is stated in the third paragraph of the article, is that USG is supporting further attention to the development, not promising it’ll happen. Obviously, USC can’t do anything without the city’s approval and cooperation.
What about the van that was driving around trying to pick up girls and posing as Campus Cruiser? What about cars flying down the row at night when it’s packed, and both bikes and students are walking from house to house? After the horrible accident/tragedy that happened last year, I think any attempt to protect the safety of students from the same accidents should be applauded.
Improve the safety???  before closing down the street perhaps people would think about not roaming the streets drunk and falling over themselves…obviously the streets are going to be dangerous when you have girls walking back by themselves drunk at late hours or bikers who have no regard for the laws of the road….being on a bike does not give you the right to fly out in front of traffic expecting them to stop when its their turn at a stop sign!!….and perhaps the greek system system should think about the troubles they will cause for the surrounding communities….
…seems like a good excuse to get out of addressing the real issue of alcohol abuse, binge drinking, and reckless partying….
Sadly, this closure (if it occurs) will trade one safety concern for another. The real problems on the row, e.g. hazing, underage drinking, and public intoxication, will not be resolved. In fact, they will be masked as the row isolates itself from the rest of the neighborhood, and even from the rest of the USC community. Nevermind the inconvenience it will pose to residents of 27th, 28th, and 30th streets. Other than Thursday – Saturday nights, the row is a useful way to get from Figueroa to Hoover, and acts as the outlet for the west end of 27th. And what about the perennial parking problem?Perhaps we should admit the real reason IFC and USG want to close the row: a bit of good ‘ole fashioned USC elitism. After all, students wandering home drunk out of their minds will still have to cross streets other than 28th.
On an unrelated note, the last paragraph of the story made me laugh. I had to make sure today wasn’t April 1. A toilet task force? Clearly the USG senators are preparing for an illustrious career in the federal government.
my thoughts exactly, 28th is a good street to go from hoover to fig. (and vice-versa) without having to go around adams and whatever. i mean if you’re in a sorority/fraternity, cool… but shutting the street down is stupid… there’s drunks on any given night at the row and catering to their whims is irresponsible on USG’s end… maybe they should focus their attention on student residences WEST of vermont, and make those areas safer… i’ve never even seen one of those CSC people patrol that area, and im sure it probably needs it more than north campus
Yeah but people that live around Vermont don’t pay as much as sororities/fraternities do. That’s the logic.
My Dad is a lawyer and says you guys can’t just close a public street.  So don’t even try!  We need a place to park our cars.   It is bad enough that I have to live next to that stinky ATO house.
When they close down 28th street can you put a 7-11 that sells beer at one end and a Starbucks at the other?  I need to get my drink-on…
When do I need to move my car or will this happen after Christmas Break?
Maybe someone hasn’t told you kids that you don’t own property on 28th street and closing the street is a “pipe dream”.  Yes some properties are owned by USC but the majority are owned by private individuals or non-profit organizations who are the real stake holders of 28th street.   Long after you have gone back to live in mom’s basement we stake holders are still here cleaning up the empty beer cans and vomit left behind.    Further, their is another small organization, the City of Los Angeles, that has much to say about closing the street.  Closing 28th will cause problems for countless surrounding streets that cannot handle the increased traffic and parking demands.  Forcing property access traffic to 20′ wide rear alleys is not going to work.   Have you ever seen move-in day at a sorority?  It makes the Normandy invasion look like an afternoon picnic.   Where are you kids going to park?  Most fraternities and sororities only have parking for a small number of their members and surrounding streets are already clogged with cars from apartment buildings with more cars than onsite parking spaces.    Maybe the Student Senate should deal with more important issues like a website where I can find a clean bathroom at 2:30am in the basement of VKC…Oh thanks you got that covered…F’kids!
Wow! So much venom! Did you get turned down by a sorority/frat? Nothing wrong with looking at options. I am sure all “organizations” including proprty owners and the city would be involved in the discussion and decision.that is how things are done. With communication, input and dialog. Traffic is hazardess on 28th. If you read the article – it states emergency vehicles would have access. Perhaps the gates could be lifted on move in days. There a many issues in life…you take them one at a time. I suggest you channel your energies onto having a positive impact on an issue you feel is important rather than being like a snake in the grass and pouncing on those who are trying to make a difference. PS – at 2.30am in the morning you should be home.
No, you are still an idiot.  What I do in the basement of VKC at 2:30am is my business….
Back in the days, I used to take a shit up on the 10th floor of WPH …not that far from VKC. The toilets are really clean, and it is quite discrete.
DB:
I shit myself in Bovard once…..
@ Don’t be a hater….
he is absolutely right…think about the surrounding community members……and ive noticed you’ve completely disregarded the fact that throngs of drunk people recklessly flood the streets falling over themselves therefore making 28th street dangerous….perhaps you guys should take responsibility for your own actions….

Fourth down and goal with just seconds on the clock. Bases loaded with two down in the bottom of the ninth. Down by one in the fourth quarter and only one shot at the hoop.
Every sport has them: those last-second, do-or-die moments. And every kid dreams of being the one who overcomes those obstacles, snatching victory from the cusp of defeat and emerging, triumphantly, a hero.
Comeback · The USC men’s crew team overtook Orange Coast College at the Head of the Harbor regatta on Nov. 15 with 300 meters remaining. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
For most of us, those visions amount to just that: dreams. But for the USC men’s crew team, those dreams became a reality.
Last weekend, the USC men’s crew team — the Trojan Navy — hosted Head of the Harbor, a nine-boat, four-kilometer regatta held in the waters off the coast of Long Beach, Calif.
From the race’s onset, the Trojans were able to establish firm leads over opponents Loyola Marymount, UC Irvine, Arizona State, Long Beach State and UC Santa Barbara. But with only a few hundred meters left and time running out, one boat still stood ahead of the Trojan Navy’s eight-man A-squad: national powerhouse Orange Coast College.
“We were overlapped with them from start to finish,” said coxswain and vice captain Myles Gutenkunst. “And with 300 meters left we said, ‘We’re running out of real estate. It’s time to put the hammer down.’”
And down the hammer came. USC managed to pass Orange Coast and win by half a boat’s length, finishing in a time of 15:26 minutes to Orange Coast’s 15:27.
“The team looks great in comparison to years past. I’m very excited for this year,” said senior captain Ryan Hasvold. “In our first race, we came in second out of all the club teams, and then this race, a win at home was awesome.
“Spring is the really serious racing season for crew,” he added. “But this fall has been amazing so far.”
The USC crew is a club sport, revitalized after the varsity team, which had competed since the late 1940s, was disbanded in the early 1990s. But despite competing without school scholarships or preferential training schedules, the team finds ways to succeed.
“The win this past weekend, it was huge,” said All-American junior Kellen Proctor. “I think it was our first overall win of a regatta in six years or so, and it was our first against Orange Coast.”
Hasvold agreed.
“Maybe it paints a big target on our backs, but it’s a great springboard into the upcoming season,” he said.
The team’s recent addition of coach Danny Johnson has also played a large role in its resurgence. But Johnson is quick to point out that no matter how much he puts into the practices, in the end it comes down to the team’s performance on race day.
“The entire squad was impressive. They rowed very well and showed a lot of courage down the course,” Johnson said. “That’s a quality you just can’t fake and it’s absolutely essential for a championship squad.”
The Trojan Navy has two more races this fall before heading inside for training until the start of the spring crew season. Though the team is already starting to gel, it always welcomes new members.
“Anyone can do it,” Proctor said. “I didn’t start until the spring of my freshman year. If anyone wants to try it, come on out and we’ll teach them how. It’s a great sport — so much fun. Like drag racing in the water.”
I think what the men’s rowing team is doing is awesome. I am part of the USC women’s rowing team and  I see the dedication these Oarsmen give everday to succeed and it truly is something each should be harolded for, those who belittle their efforts do not fully comprehend what they give up nor do they understand the life skills rowing offers in helping to shape well-rounded individuals. Their committment to the team and practices are just as demanding as that of any varsity program at USC.
I rowed with the USC women’s crew team in the 90’s.  We were all shocked to lose the men’s varsity team in 1994.  Glad to see you guys are making a comeback!
As an alum who attended USC in the late 70’s, early 80’s, I remember when we had a varsity crew, and was kinda surprised to learn that it is now a club sport.  I’m married to a rower (Penn) and I know what a driven sport it can be, having started doing it myself.  And for a club team to be able to beat OCC, wow, really great accomplishment.  When I wrote on the DT oh so many years ago, we made a concerted effort to cover teams that usually don’t get a lot of the glory.  There’s not a lot of glamor in a sport that has you up before light breaks on a cold, damp morning when you’d rather be staying in bed.  All the rowers I know do it for the love of the sport.  So I think a few inches in the DT every now and then is damn well appropriate.
Kyle S. and Michael,
It’s a sports section; no real news will be reported.  News is located in the front of the DT or in the LA Times.
Also, club sports are frequently mentioned in the DT.  Recently I’ve seen articles from Dragonboat, Ping pong, equestrian, frisbee, lacrosse, hockey, rugby, etc.
Another thing to consider – the USC Men’s Crew (a club sport) competes against varsity crews as well as other club teams.  Think of it this way: if our club water polo team beat our varsity water polo team, would you think that was “newsworthy?”  Would it be “newsworthy” that we have rowers being scouted for the US National Team?  I love and support our varsity sports as much as anyone, particularly football and basketball (men and women), but I agree there should be a wider spread to coverage in the sports section.  I’m also just happy seeing an article about us in the DT after years of seeing articles about the Women’s Crew (even though they are great).
Michael- you obviously cared enough to click on the link and post a comment.  I doubt you have ever done anything in your life even remotely as challenging as rowing.  Get a life and don’t try to belittle others because you are unhappy with your own life.
OCC Rower- I’m glad someone is able to understand the struggles a rebuilding team has to go through.  OCC is a great team and I look forward to racing you again this weekend.  May the best crew win.
Kyle S.-  I understand your point, but I would like to make a few comments that might change your mind.
1-  The USC Men’s Crew won all three events at the Long Beach regatta the week after Head of the Harbor.  The team is actually good and making some noise in the world of rowing.
2-  The ping pong team also had an article in this edition of the DT, so other club teams get their fair share of attention, too.
I agree with OCC Rower about the respect team members deserve for their daily routines to keep their team going. However, I agree with Michael in that this really isn’t newsworthy. Either focus exclusively on varsity teams or give equal attention to other club teams.
I care. You wake up at 5:00 am every morning six days a week to workout and then do it a second time in the dark that afternoon. Come home, eat, do homework, and repeat all over again. Not all of us have the luxury of commenting on college newspaper articles all day. I have tremendous respect for these guys. Way to go men.
Please give us real news. I don’t believe anyone cares about the men’s rowing team. This seems like a vain attempt to get cheap publicity.

Sometimes, the best way to gauge the public opinion of an event is to ask someone not particularly inundated with its details.
You know what I mean?
Taking control · Referees stopped what could have been a brawl. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Like, if you were trying to decide whether Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA” has become a certifiable hit, you wouldn’t ask a friend who is a popular music major.
I bet he or she would have a strong argument either way. But your other friend — the one who doesn’t listen to that much music but always knows Akon’s song choruses when they are played at 2 a.m. — they would be the right person to ask.
Where am I going with this?
Well, in many cases, the supposed expert isn’t always the right person to ask.
Take the last minute of USC’s 28-7 win over UCLA on Saturday — it’s sparked quite a bit of analysis in the sports world.
You can group the majority of opinions into three general groups: UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel’s camp, USC coach Pete Carroll’s camp, and the “everyone’s bad” opinion.
The Los Angeles Times’ Bill Plaschke trashed Neuheisel in the Sunday paper, calling him a “brat.” ESPN.com’s Ted Miller said his timeout was “useless and annoying.”
Sports Illustrated’s Arash Markazi called it an absolutely embarrassing performance by USC; the Orange County Register’s Jeff Miller preferred the phrase “thoroughly unnecessary.”
Contradictory pieces, for sure. Somebody has to be right, right? And somebody has to be wrong, right?
Wrong.
Maybe neither coach was wrong.
Maybe calling a timeout with 52 seconds left to play and all your timeouts  in a two-score game isn’t all that absurd.
Maybe playing to win in a rivalry game isn’t unheard of and actually completely rational — for both teams.
Now that seems to make a little bit of sense to me, but, hey, I don’t expect you to listen to me. I understand.
I’m no expert. I didn’t play high school football and I’m certainly not a former pro athlete — or professional writer, for that matter.
But just listen to the athletes.
Save for the knee-jerk reactions from both teams immediately after fourth-year junior receiver Damian Williams ran into the end zone, players on both sides largely took a that’s-what-I-would-do approach.
More than one USC player said the Williams catch was standard protocol for the situation.
Redshirt senior linebacker Reggie Carter and sophomore free safety Rahim Moore, UCLA’s two defensive leaders, were each quoted as praising the Trojans for a well-thought out play.
Said Carter: “I would have done the exact same thing.”
Now, can I make a suggestion?
How about we take all this hoopla, everything that everyone has said in wake of “the final minute,” and just forget it?
How about we remember the 2009 version of the USC-UCLA rivalry as exactly what it was — an entirely uninteresting game juiced up a bit by an intriguing final minute — and forget what it wasn’t?
And how about we hope that the final minute sparks a rivalry actually becoming of the word “rivalry,” and not the domination USC has had over UCLA in recent years?
The Trojans have won 10 of the last 11 games between the two teams.
Yes, that’s a great stat for any USC fan, but with it comes the simple fact that most of these games haven’t been exciting, haven’t been close, haven’t been rivalry-esque.
And that’s what redshirt sophomore middle linebacker Chris Galippo was talking about when he compared the USC-UCLA rivalry to others across the nation after Saturday’s game.
He said every other rivalry was rife with controversy — and it’s true. USC-UCLA has paled in comparison in recent years.
The Battle for Los Angeles isn’t even close to the best inter-region rivalry in the Pac-10.
Oregon and Oregon State’s Civil War will be a lot bigger deal when the two teams match up Thursday night. And this year’s Big Game between Stanford and Cal came down to the wire.
Because when it comes down to it, players on both squads enjoy these types of rivalries.
That’s why you saw sophomore defensive tackle Jurrell Casey waggle his tongue out and freshman quarterback Matt Barkley mouth “scoreboard” to the UCLA sideline on the Fox Sports Network broadcast of the game.
That’s why UCLA was so peeved about the issue at first.
And that’s why USC and UCLA need a larger-scale rivalry to capture these issues in forthcoming games.
More of the excitement, please. Less of the monotony.

There’s just one regular season game left on the schedule for the Trojans, but coach Pete Carroll is still switching around his lineup.
This week’s order of business: the offensive line.
Clearing the way · Senior offensive lineman Kristofer O’Dowd (61) will replace Jeff Byers (53) at center against Arizona. Byers will move over to the left guard spot when the preseason All-American returns to action. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Carroll announced after practice Tuesday that junior Kristofer O’Dowd will be moving back into the starting lineup, replacing Jeff Byers at center.
Byers, a sixth-year senior, will move over to left guard in his final game at the Coliseum.
“We haven’t had a chance to get Kris playing much,” Carroll said. “He’s been playing really well in practice the last couple of weeks and we need to get him in a game. We’ll see how that works with that combination.”
Senior Charles Brown and sophomore Tyron Smith will continue to anchor the line at the tackle spots. Filling out the five-man line, redshirt junior Butch Lewis will slide over from left to right guard, pushing senior Alex Parsons out of the starting lineup.
“Butch has played really well wherever we put him,” Carroll said. “And we know Jeff is fine to play left guard for us.”
O’Dowd was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection last season and a preseason All-American this season. Earlier this year, he pulled himself out of the running for the center spot, saying his play was subpar.
Now, he’s ready to get back into the mix.
“It’s really a chance to get Kris back into the game and this is, we think, the best way to move it around,” Carroll said.
u
Hand-in-hand with the end of the season comes the end of home careers for a number of Trojan seniors.
Six USC players will likely be making their final career starts at home — including Byers and sixth-year senior safety Josh Pinkard.
“People like Jeff and Josh, those guys have been here for so long and they’ve done so much for us,” said redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams. “We’ll definitely miss them. This game’s more about going out and playing for those guys — the guys who have put in the most work and busted their butt for years.”
Williams could be suiting up at the Coliseum for the final time as well. Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said that the significance of this game is clear to the non-seniors on the team.
“Especially with the seniors and this being their last game and us younger players realizing that,” Barkley said. “We’re trying to make it the best experience for them.”
u
On the injury front, Williams is still hurting.
The receiver played against UCLA and pulled down a team-leading five catches for 82 yards, but he said Tuesday that his injured right ankle hasn’t completely healed.
He practiced on Competition Tuesday, but afterwards, he estimated he was running at about 85 percent.
Junior running back Joe McKnight sat out practice to rest the bruised thigh he suffered against UCLA.
McKnight said he expects to suit up this Saturday against Arizona; Carroll agreed.
“I think he’s going to be okay for the weekend,” Carroll said. “But he might not get much work in this week.”
McKnight didn’t play in the fourth quarter against the Bruins after suffering the injury. Redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford took his place.
Bradford said Tuesday that he will be ready for whatever situation occurs against the Wildcats.
“You never know — he might go down in the game, he might not,” Bradford said. “So I’m just going to keep working and get what I get on Saturday.”
Bradford scored two touchdowns and ran for 62 yards last Saturday. Carroll also mentioned redshirt junior C.J. Gable as a possible replacement for McKnight in certain packages.
“He certainly does everything out of the backfield that Joe does,” Carroll said. “And all of the routes and all of the schemes and screens and all of the things that he’s done over the years — C.J. can do all of that.”
Gable, who started his first game as a true freshman, has carried the ball only 21 times this season for 93 yards. He ran just one time for two yards against UCLA.
u
The focus for USC has turned to Arizona’s offense, which has relied on two different quarterbacks  this season.
Wildcats head coach Mike Stoops started the season with sophomore Matt Scott as his starting signal-caller, but pulled him after three quarters against Iowa.
Nick Foles took over and has put up an impressive 67.4 percent completion percentage in eight starts.
“He’s done a good job,” Carroll said. “He looks really confident and in control of the offense. He’s had an excellent year as a first-year starter.”
Arizona still utilizes Scott in running situations. He’s rushed for 305 yards on 40 carries this season, including a 10-carry, 91-yard performance against Washington State.
At 6-foot-3 and 190 pounds, Scott brings more of a scrambling mentality to the quarterback spot.
“He’s much more anxious to run the football and do the quarterback running things that we’ve seen so common in the last couple of years,” Carroll said. “So they present a lot of problems for us.”

It’s been called the hardest position in all of collegiate sports.
Point guard? Quarterback? Catcher?
In sheer toughness and difficulty, none of those require the complexity and combination of skills needed to succeed at the two-meter position in water polo.
Senior leader · Senior two-meter J.W. Krumpholz has been a major part of the USC men’s water polo team’s dominance over recent years. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
At USC, an adept senior tandem of two-meters J.W. Krumpholz and Jordan Thompson are approaching the end of a remarkable four-year run that will leave an indelible mark in the Trojan record books for both the team and its members.
The position of two-meter in water polo is integral to the success of the team. The offense runs through the two-meter, and, in most cases, the player sets the pace for the rest of the team.
“Two-meter isn’t a glorious position. You take the brunt of the blame for your team, you’re right there front and center and you’re basically a hub for the team’s success,” Thompson said.
Along with the added pressure, the physicality of the position can take its toll. Both Thompson and Krumpholz have played four seasons at the position while being subjected to the constant battle that comes with being just two meters from the goal.
“Imagine the NBA if you couldn’t call a foul from the chest down,” Thompson said. “I’m constantly getting hit, but at the same time I need to keep my poise so I can receive the ball and do something productive with it.”
“It’s nonstop playing the two-meter position, nonstop action,” Krumpholz added.
Listed at 6 feet 3 inches tall and 200 pounds, Krumpholz found out at an early age that his size would be an important advantage as a two-meter player. Krumpholz, whose father also played water polo, followed his father’s footsteps into the sport and was almost immediately placed at the two-meter position.
“I was always bigger, so they put me at the two-meter position. I could have changed a few times here or there, but I’ve pretty much always had my back to the cage as the two-meter,” Krumpholz said.
Thompson, who at 6 feet 6 inches and 270 pounds, also took advantage of his size to become skilled at the sport’s most important position. Thompson started the sport at 12 years old, but initially struggled.
“For my first two years I was absolutely miserable, but on my 14th birthday I went to a tournament and a switch just flipped,” Thompson said. “And since then I’ve yet to get bored of the sport.”
The two-meter position became a natural fit for Thompson once he hit his stride.
“I’m a big guy and I’ve always been real physical,” Thompson said.
Before their time at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, the high school honors came in droves for both seniors. Both were given All-American High School Honors and led their schools to very successful runs.
Both also competed for club teams — for Krumpholz, all of the accolades led to an invitation to the US National Team at the young age of 17.
Krumpholz played in the 2005 World Championships in Montreal, the 2006 Junior Pan American Games and the 2007 FINA Junior World Championships during his early national team experience, all leading up to a spot on the US Olympic Water Polo team at the 2008 Olympic Games, where he won a silver medal with the team.
“The Olympics was one of the greatest experiences I’ve had to date,” Krumpholz said.
For all the recognition and experience the two have had in their water polo careers, their college careers are now coming to an end.
As the Trojans head into the NCAA Championships this weekend in Princeton, NJ as the No. 1 overall seed, both players talked highly of their coach Jovan Vavic and his positive influence on their careers.
“He’s hands down the most knowledgeable water polo coach in the country,” Thompson said.
“He’s helped me a lot; I don’t think I would have gone to the Olympics if he wasn’t my coach,” Krumpholz, who won the Peter J. Cutino award in 2008, said. “He’s taught me a lot.”
Krumpholz and Thompson have been a part of one of the most successful runs in USC men’s water polo team history and, as two-meter men, have been in the midst of games from scrimmages to the three NCAA Championship finals the team played in the past three years.
“Two-meter is the toughest position to play in any collegiate sport, but it’s also the most gratifying,” Thompson said.
