Several campus groups and organizations hosted events over the weekend to kick off USC’s participation in National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week with various performances and charity opportunities.
Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week is observed nationally the week before Thanksgiving to draw attention to the problems of hunger and homelessness in the United States. About 51,000 people were counted as homeless in the county in 2011, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.
More than 20 neighborhood and campus groups, including SC Homelessness Initiative, USC Graduate Student Government and USC Student Interfaith Council, have united to support the week, according to event organizer Katherine Schofield, a minister for campus engagement at United University Church. The groups will host several events each day through Sunday.
The week’s events began Thursday in Taper Hall with a double-feature film screening of the documentary Homeless in Paradise and the 2009 film The Soloist. On Friday, programming included a performance of the play Surviving the Nickel, at Ground Zero Performance Cafe. The play, which  was written by Melvin Ishmael Johnson, challenges the social perception of the homeless community, specifically the community of Skid Row in Downtown Los Angeles. The play was performed by a troupe of homeless and former-homeless performers in the non-profit theatre company Dramastage-Qumran.
Schofield, also the director of the Office of Religious Life’s Spirituality and Sexuality Program, hopes the events throughout the week motivate and encourage students to connect more viscerally to the issue of homelessness.
“We want to meet students where they are,” Schofield said. “If you’re more comfortable donating money or clothing to a homeless service agency, or learning more about affordable housing in L.A., that’s a great place to start. If you want to meet homeless individuals, hear their stories and get connected with local organizations that advocate on behalf of the homeless and hungry, we’ve got these opportunities as well.”
Vivian Yan, a junior and one of the co-presidents of SC Homelessness Initiative, said when she first came to USC very few campus organizations addressed homelessness. She found the absence strange because she said homelessness is a big issue in the city.
“What really pushes me to want to do this week, and to that point all the events, is that there are tons of people living out on the streets every night in Los Angeles,” Yan said. “It’s really easy as USC students to forget about everything outside of those gates.”
Highlighted events throughout this week include a panel discussion Tuesday addressing the issue of affordable housing in the USC area and in Los Angeles and an awareness event in Founder’s Park from Tuesday to Friday where people can donate to United Way or Home For Good. Throughout the week, students can also donate food in Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Room 224.
According to Schofield, the week aims to encourage a lifelong drive to combat homelessness.
“Students make great advocates because today’s students will be tomorrow’s community leaders,” Schofield said.

Readjusting to civilian life presents quite a challenge for veterans returning from war.
During a Veterans Day Appreciation Reception on Friday in the USC Radisson Hotel, René Bardorf, deputy assistant secretary of defense for community and public outreach, emphasized the importance of reintegrating soldiers and including veterans in the community.
According to Bardorf, a survey conducted this year revealed that 95 percent of soldiers feel disconnected from civilians -— a statistic she said must change.
Bardorf explained that soldiers are three times more likely to volunteer in their community than citizens who have not served.
“They can help shape the future of the country, but they need help from the community,” she said.
Many veterans present for the speech agreed with Bardorf’s statements about the disconnect.
“It struck a cord,” said David Kim, a senior majoring in business who served in the Navy. “What she said is what is in our subconscious. She had it on the dot.”
For many soldiers, the biggest adjustment is being away from their unit, Bardorf said. The lack of cohesion makes reintegration a challenge, as veterans feel alienated from society and without anyone to talk with.
Though Bardorf’s grandfather, father and husband all served in the military, she admitted she never fully understood the life of a post-war soldier until her own work with veterans.
Bardorf has had some incredible interactions with injured veterans through her work with the Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund, which  provides immediate financial assistance for injured and critically ill members of the U.S. Armed Forces. She told a moving story about a soldier who had lost his vision, both his legs and one of his hands. He was in the hospital with his parents, and Bardorf was charged with delivering a relief check to him.
“I was terrified to go on the hospital unit floor,” Bardorf said. “I had never seen someone who had been through that. I was shaking like a leaf.”
What touched her most, however, was the soldier’s kindness and resilience.
“He said ‘the only thing I miss is the unit back in Iraq. Not my legs or my vision, just my unit,’” Bardorf said. “That experience changed who I am.”
Bardorf also emphasized the importance of motivating veterans to tell their stories.
“Share your story with civilians,” Bardorf said. “They only hear what they see on the news. They don’t hear what’s in your hearts.”
She explained that if she had not heard the stories of the wounded Marines, she never would have gained the perspective on veteran life that she has today.
The integration of veterans into civilian life is always difficult, but even more issues can arise for student veterans. Bardorf said. Student veterans often have trouble relating to peers who might not understand or appreciate what they’ve been through.
“It feels trivial versus the work they’ve done in service,” Bardorf said. “They feel they have to deal with inefficient or ineffective professors and teachers.”
Joshua Jacobs, a senior majoring in business who was a sergeant in the Marines and served from 2007 to 2011, strongly agreed with this point.
“We have to deal with so much just to get here,” said Jacobs, who is the president of the USC Veterans Association. “It’s really hard to readjust. No one appreciates the lives we have lived. It can become easier to overcome when they find that community.”
Shane Quinn, a senior majoring in business who served in the Marines from 2004 to 2009, expressed similar sentiments about the challenge of relating to peers.
“Your whole life is turned upside down,” Quinn said. “You go from everyone understanding you to being in college where no one understands.”
Not only do veterans feel isolated, but they also often sense confusion from other students who might not treat their service time respectfully.
“Students are not aware,” Kim said. “They are very oblivious to asking inappropriate questions. They will ask, ‘How many people have you killed?’’
In an effort to improve support  for student veterans, Jacobs and the association are currently working on hosting networking events for veterans.
“When soldiers are in school, we treat it like the military,” Jacobs said. “We put our heads down and do what we are supposed to do — do well in school. Often they forget to think about what happens after school.”
With Veterans Day on Monday, Bardorf closed her speech by urging students to express their gratitude for veterans.
“Find a way to thank a vet,” she said. ”Their sacrifice needs to be appreciated at home.”

USC President C. L. Max Nikias announced Friday that philanthropist Glorya Kaufman gave the university a monetary gift that will fund the creation of the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and construction of the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center.
The Kaufman School of Dance is the first school to be created by an endowment at USC in almost four decades. Though the university did not disclose the exact amount of the donation, Nikias called it a “generous gift” in a statement.
With the addition of the Kaufman School of Dance, USC will have a total of six schools of the arts in its repertoire, “completing USC’s vibrant portfolio of visual and performing arts programs,” as Nikias said in the statement. Other fine arts schools at USC include the School of Architecture, School of Cinematic Arts, School of Dramatic Arts, Roski School of Fine Arts and Thornton School of Music.
Robert Cutietta, who is currently also the dean of the Thornton School of Music, will head the school. Kaufman’s gift will not only build the school, but will also help fund its programs, faculty, scholarships and student recruitment.
The dance school will offer classes in various forms of dance performance, such as classical ballet, jazz, world dance and modern.
Students in the Kaufman School of Dance will earn a bachelor of fine arts in dance with the ability to double major or minor in other areas of their choosing.
Kaufman hopes the school will prepare dancers not only for their performance career, but also for the work they will have to do promoting themselves in order to be cast, according to Nikias.
“She has expressed her twofold wish to prepare dancers to be both exceptional performers and skilled businesspeople, to equip them to ably navigate the professional aspects of an artist’s life,” Nikias said in the statement.
Kaufman’s relationship with the new dance school will add prestige because of her affiliation with the world of dance. Kaufman founded the Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at The Music Center program in Los Angeles, and has contributed considerable donations to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and The Juilliard School.
Kaufman also previously donated $18 million to UCLA in 1999 to fund improvements to the renovations of its School of Arts and Architecture building, although she was ultimately unsatisfied with how the university used her gift.
“I was disappointed in UCLA,” Kaufman told the Los Angeles Times. “They don’t have a dance school. It was all talk.”
At USC, however, Nikias said focusing on the success of the Kaufman School will be a priority.
“Our ambition is to make the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance the most elite on the west coast and in the Pacific Rim,” he said in the statement.
The first generation of Kaufman dance students is expected to enroll in the fall of 2015.
LOL…I don’t think there is a University anywhere that doesn’t “chase after $50 million donations”.  
The University has been clear in its goal to become one of the few undisputed elite universities in the world.
Not being critical, just curious:
Does the University have any firm long term goals, or do they just chase after $50 million donations?

Stepping into the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on Saturday night was like stepping into the underground — there is no other way to describe the Sónar festival’s North American Tour.
Daring duo · The South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord was a highlight of the Sónar music festival at the Shrine Auditorium on Saturday night. The group offers their own unique brand of music and edge. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
The festival notably attracted a much older, edgier crowd, complete with full body tattoos, unnatural hair colors, studs and painted faces, than one typically spots on or near the University Park Campus. The bass shaking the gothic windows and the cavernous auditorium for the event only added to the dark-in-every-way feeling.
The lineup featured five groups of similar genres — Nic Fanciulli, Paul Kalkbrenner, Die Antwoord, Azari & III and Seth Troxler. All are popular in their respective countries; the Sónar festival travels around the world spreading the unique sounds to places like Tokyo, Sao Paulo and Reykjavik, in addition to its American tour. The music was mostly in the veins of novelty hip-hop and electronic dance music crossover, organized such that the high-energy South African rap group, Die Antwoord, performed in the middle, preceded and followed by more traditional house music. Sónar Festival was one of the few that placed its headliner in the middle of its set list; though it helped rev up the energy for the early on, many attendees left after that performance.
Sónar seemed to be somewhat hastily set up; granted, they aren’t being funded by a massive music corporation, but the lack of a hard-copy set list and awkward pauses between sets made it seem a bit unprofessional. For example, the website indicated that the show began at 9 p.m., but Nic Fanciulli began performing at 8:20 p.m. His beats, steady with a bassline typical of house music, provided a decent pump-up for the crowd that was already present and a nice background while people mingled, drank and settled into the concert.
Soon, Paul Kalkbrenner, a German DJ and actor, took his place and proceeded to amp up the crowd even more with his EDM sounds. His music featured electronic melodies over an ever-present thudding bassline, the subwoofers so intense that the bass could be felt in listeners’ hearts. The trippy visuals, almost like the iTunes visualizer, enhanced by the strobe lights and body-moving beats created a psychedelic vibe.
Kalkbrenner knew how to work the crowd, dancing while working on stage, lighting a few cigarettes and having fun with his listeners; it seemed he was out to create an experience for his listeners rather than make his set all about his performance. Still, his somewhat awkward transitions coupled with his set’s lack of musical cohesion weakened his portion of the festival.
After a 30-minute intermission, Die Antwoord finally entered the auditorium. The South African “rap-rave” group, comprising MCs Ninja and Yo-Landi in combination with DJ Hi-Tek, provided an almost outlandish hip-hop and rave crossover, which is part of the Zef counter-culture movement in their country. Their music is designed to be futuristic and shocking to audiences, and it certainly was.
The group made full use of the stage, moving to its music in an almost African dance, including signature hip thrusts. Highlights included its version of Mims’ “This Is Why I’m Hot,” “I Fink U Freeky,” and a closing performance of “Enter The Ninja,” a much more house-inspired track. Still, more enunciation could have improved an already strong performance.
The trio started strong in neon orange and surrounded by African images. The two vocalists unexpectedly complemented each other well despite Yo-Landi’s high-pitched chipmunk sound and Ninja’s growling raps. They maintained a high energy throughout their performance and were highly interactive with the crowd; Ninja crowd-surfed twice, gave Los Angeles a few shout-outs and conversed with the crowd, adding to the vibes reverberating across the high ceilings.
Die Antwoord is truly unique and novel in its edginess, in a way that is not over-the-top like Nicki Minaj or Rihanna; it has freshness, rawness and swag. Many popular rappers nowadays tend to have negative or harsh vibes to them, but Die Antwoord’s tracks, and the Zef movement in general, can evoke a positive, feel-good time, despite explicit lyrics.
Azari & III followed and moved the festival into a more electronic feel. The Canadian foursome essentially transcends all genres; the group’s wonderful variety and range of capabilities defies a definitive label. The set started with background bass covered by psychedelic strums and urgent rapping by the two vocalists, Fritz Helder and Starving Yet Full. The music, at first listen frenzied and disjointed, successfully and unexpectedly bridges the rock, rave and almost ritualistic African scenes.
Though the music was incredible, the performance wasn’t as entertaining. The group did not work the crowd as well as their preceding acts, possibly because their set felt more decidedly low-key with standing mics and little movement. The group’s hit “Manic” as well as its final songs, which contained more of a ’90s pop and Michael Jackson feel, were the most entertaining parts of its act.
Seth Troxler, the last act, provided the perfect end to the experience of the Sónar Festival; in most other cases, the highest energy performer should have gone last, but Troxler’s intensely futuristic house music was a good transition for coming down from the high of the previous acts. His deep, minimal house music gave off a more relaxed, trance vibe rather than that of raging dance music.  Troxler himself, however, did not seem entirely excited to be performing; he lacked the energy necessary to fully engage the crowd.
Sónar serves as a refreshing music festival; it is one of the more personal and casual festivals out there due to the smaller venue and lesser-known artists. Instead of prioritizing  attending a music festival, Sónar put the emphasis on the music, an idea that’s refreshing and welcome in today’s mainstream concert scene.
To the author of this article. It is apparent you have no idea what the Sonar Music Festival is. It is a massive 3 day music festival in Barcelona every year in June that has happened annually for 17 years now. Please read more about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B3nar
This event at the shrine was not a festival, it was simply one stop on a North American tour of a few of the artists that perform at the main festival in Barcelona. Sort of a way to promote the main festival if you will.
This is by no means an underground festival either, it can be comparable to our winter music conference in Miami where UMC takes place each March. Hundreds of thousands of people attend from all over the world.
“Still, more enunciation could have improved an already strong performance.” – seriously? have you listened to them before? please send someone who is actually into the indie/ underground music scene to review a concert of this type next time. i mean its not LMFAO or ke$ha performing.  it seems like this person went without knowing the groups and had to look them up afterword.  not even a mention of Azari & III’s amazing modernization of the whole 90’s house music phenom that is totally coming back right now. and if i see another ‘african-like’ comparison haha. As someone who doesn’t go to USC and attends a good amount of music fests – maybe im just part of that ‘older (26), edgier’ crowd perspective. sorry. lol

Especially now that the semester is ending, it is vital to get on your professors’ good sides. No, I don’t mean becoming the ass-kisser who sits in the front row and relentlessly participates for brownie points, making everyone else inwardly (sometimes outwardly) groan. Professors see through fake behavior just as well as other students do; getting on your professor’s good side actually involves trying to know them better outside the classroom.
For some, small talk with professors can be uncomfortable and intimidating. We often forget that the professors who stand in front of us every day for an hour are people, too. From a student’s perspective, it’s easy to only view a professor as the foreboding authority figure with a red pen. In their hands lies the fate of our grades and, sometimes, our futures. This isn’t all there is to your professors, though: Outside the lecture hall, they actually have lives, interests, problems and human characteristics just like us.
Shocking, I know.
In reaching out to professors, office hours are essential. Even if you’re acing the class and don’t need additional help, most professors really appreciate the gesture of visiting during this open-office time. By setting aside time in your schedule to speak with them, you’re acknowledging that the professor has also set aside time in their schedule to help you. This mutual recognition is the basis for a healthy student-professor relationship.
Dragging yourself into office hours is only the beginning, though. It’s a proven fact that this is a step in the right direction, but don’t just use the office hours for tips on how to improve your mediocre essay that you wrote the night before it was due. We all know that junk is beyond saving.
Instead, try to get to know your professor as a fellow person; most of the time, they will appreciate your company and you might even make a new friend. Being friends with a professor might seem a little strange, but it’s completely possible and it happens all the time. If you truly take an interest in a class or you study abroad through a university program, you are almost guaranteed to become closer with at least one professor during your time at USC. In fact, if graduation rolls around and you can honestly say that you haven’t gotten to know at least a handful of professors, I think this would be considered a failure.
Think about it logically: Why wouldn’t you want to get to know your professors better? A professor is someone experienced in the field of study you’ve chosen to pursue, so it only seems fitting that you would seek them out and try to forge a connection.
Aside from possessing a vast knowledge of the coursework, your professor can answer questions you have concerning the careers and opportunities that relate to the subjects you’re studying.
Professors are among the best resources available to students on campus. They provide opportunities for research, connections for obtaining an impressive job and, most importantly, expert advice. It makes sense to talk with your journalism professor about getting published in the real world or discussing the trials and tribulations of med school with the person who instructs your biochemistry class.
Recommendation letters and references are always a plus on resumes, and professors will write glowing reviews about you if you make the effort to interact with them outside classroom hours. Take an interest in the research or projects they’re doing. It feels nice when others ask you about your side projects and personal endeavors, so apply this idea to interacting with your professors. There’s more to learn from them besides the material assigned from a syllabus and, most often, this unassigned material is the most rewarding.
If you’re reading this and forming a counter-argument that none of your classes inspire you to talk with your professor about the subject, then you are definitely creating the wrong schedule. You should at least be able to identify certain aspects of your major or minor that attracted you to them in the first place; once you find these, figure out how to discuss them with your professor.
No matter how obscure your interests or how vague your questions, never hesitate to bring them up with your professor during office hours. They’ve gone through a similar experience — the difficult collegiate path of finding yourself and a successful place in the career world — so take advantage of the advice they can give.
Professors are valuable assets to university students for a multitude of reasons, but the most important one to remember is their ability to provide much-needed guidance. Just like any sort of teacher, professors have the ability to make or break an academic experience. With that in mind, seek out the professors who inspire you and strike up a conversation. You won’t be disappointed.

Daniel Craig finally got the James Bond film that will be remembered
as his classic.
Polarizing performances · Daniel Craig (left) and Javier Bardem star as James Bond and rogue agent Raoul Silva in Skyfall.

Craig already had two turns as Bond, but Casino Royale was a reboot focused on Bond’s origin as a 00 agent, while Quantum of Solace was a follow-up aimed more at revenge than adventure. But in Skyfall, his third outing and the Bond film series’ 50th anniversary installment, Craig gets the adventure that might define his time as Ian Fleming’s super spy.
Skyfall has a relatively simple plot setup, but engages with the narrative in complex ways that make the film work. When Bond is left for dead after a failed mission to recover a stolen list of undercover spies, former MI6 agent Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) is free to enact his revenge plan: attacking MI6 and going after M, his former MI6 employer. After witnessing the destruction back home on the news, Bond decides it’s time to come back, even if he isn’t the same as before.
Even though the film has a major impact on the Bond franchise and gets introspective, it never feels like it’s out to comment on or reinvent the Bond legacy. Instead, Skyfall reboots the series while still offering a new Bond adventure.
Skyfall will likely draw comparisons to 1995’s Goldeneye, where Pierce Brosnan’s Bond took on a rogue agent with a vendetta while also grappling with questions of his own relevance. But despite the casual similarities in plot and theme, Skyfall maintains its own identity. Silva’s motives are much more specific and personal, and his scheme far less grand. Skyfall doesn’t examine the Bond franchise as Goldeneye did, but rather Bond the man.
In the 50 years of the character’s screen presence, Skyfall is the first Bond film since On Her Majesty’s Secret Service to really delve into what makes Fleming’s spy tick. The film isn’t really based on any of Fleming’s texts but delivers more of Bond’s backstory than any previous installment.
Daniel Craig is at his stoic best as Bond in this outing. He’s still a clever, straightforward government agent, but he’s given real personal challenges. Instead of the more superficial romances of the Brosnan era, these are psychological dilemmas, and they add to the tension that permeates the movie.
By contrast, Bardem’s Silva is delightfully unhinged. He’s dangerous, both physically and in his awareness of common villain pitfalls and is also truly insane. It’s his unpredictability — mixed with his skill set — that makes him so threatening. Every time Bardem is onscreen, Skyfall crackles with raw energy. He isn’t as iconic or open to parody as Blofeld and not as outright sinister as Red Grant, but he embodies all the strengths of a classic Bond villain without any of the camp the series has built up.
Craig is helped by an incredible supporting cast. Aside from the returning Dame Judi Dench as M, who delivers her best Bond performance in the role, there’s Ralph Fiennes, Helen McCrory and Albert Finney. But the best addition is Ben Whishaw, who resurrects the character of Q, MI6’s gadgeteer quartermaster. Thankfully, Whishaw’s not some cliche, hipster, Mark Zuckerberg knockoff. Skyfall touches on his youth, but focuses on his raw skill and interactions with the gruffer, more field-oriented Bond.
But the greatest strength of Skyfall is that it actually has suspense. Even with more than 20 films under its belt, the Bond franchise has felt more action-oriented than suspenseful, even with its espionage themes.
Director Sam Mendes works a sense of paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. The final set piece, despite its action focus, works because Mendes has built up the tension and can deliver in the payoff without being predictable.
Cinematographer Roger Deakins, Mendes’ longtime collaborator, helps bring back the allure of the Bond experience. The film looks beautiful, and the shots of modern Shanghai and the London Underground are captivating. After the stark, blunt quality of Casino Royale’s locales, or the washed-out style in Quantum of Solace, seeing a Bond film that’s just as stylistic while embracing the beauty of travel is refreshing and adds to the thrill of Bond’s mission.
Deakins’ use of long takes — whether it’s Bond waltzing through a Macau casino or fighting with an assassin amid bright lights — bring something new to the series and makes Skyfall one of the most visually appealing films of 2012.
Thomas Newman, another Mendes collaborator, provides the music instead of longtime Bond composer David Arnold and proves more than adept in the role. The score heightens the tension but never telegraphs the film’s next moves. And Adele provides a theme song that never feels overblown and meshes perfectly with Newman’s score and the tone of the film.
Fifty years ago, in 1962, Sean Connery brought Fleming’s Bond to the silver screen with Dr. No. Half a century later, the team of Mendes, Craig and company has proven that the franchise not only isn’t dead, but is only just getting started. Skyfall is one of the series’ best installments, and joins On Her Majesty’s Secret Service and From Russia With Love as defining takes on the character. James Bond is guaranteed to return, but it’ll be hard to top an installment as good as Skyfall.

For  most lovers of cinema, a Steven Spielberg feature film marks a welcome blessing on the release calendar. As perhaps the most influential film icon working today, Spielberg has created countless classic films and pioneered multiple aspects of the film industry.

The film focuses on the last few months of Abraham Lincoln’s presidency as he struggles to find a way to end the Civil War. – | [,;’Photo by David James, SMPSP, courtesy of DreamWorks II Distribution Co., LLC.Thus, the expectations surrounding Lincolnhave been predictably high. But these anticipations are further heightened by Spielberg’s long-term interest in an Abraham Lincoln film.
Historical snapshot · Daniel Day-Lewis stars as the titular character in Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln. The film focuses on the last few months of Abraham Lincoln’s presidency as he struggles to find a way to end the Civil War. – | [,;’Photo by David James, SMPSP, courtesy of DreamWorks II Distribution Co., LLC.
Though based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, Spielberg’s film is a departure from the traditional biopic its title suggests. Rather than reproduce the entire life story of Abraham Lincoln, screenwriter Tony Kushner and Spielberg made the conscious effort to focus on the several months leading up to his assassination. The president’s struggle to pass the 13th Amendment, an enactment abolishing slavery in the United States, drives the plot of Lincoln. Now, what has been often described in history books as a simple act of justice holds deeper, more complex undertones. Kushner’s script portrays Lincoln properly trying to end the Civil War, working with a divided House of Representatives and living with an unstable family.
In Lincoln, Spielberg refreshingly allows dialogue to take center stage. Kushner’s recognition of the significance of language to Lincoln’s persona comes through in the eloquent speeches and rich debate among the characters. With famous speeches, such as the Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln is arguably one of the most profound speakers America has ever known. Kushner highlights the president’s eloquence by filling his script with an abundance of well-crafted lines. Originally an award-winning playwright, Kushner masterfully translates dense, dull political concepts into enthralling soliloquies. Cleverly, however, Kushner also adds a comical dimension to Lincoln to keep a constant hold on audiences’ attentions and to break up the presentation of heavy topics.
Kushner and Spielberg also make a brilliant decision in leaving the tense ending to Lincoln’s presidency and life offscreen. It’s a wise move, as a narrative beginning at his birth and concluding in his assassination would be much too long to fit into typical feature-film runtime. By limiting his literary scope to the last few months of Lincoln’s presidency, Kushner frees himself to tell a more compelling story and inject it with political and personal themes.
Though Lincoln’s terms as commander in chief transpired roughly 150 years ago, the messages conveyed through his leadership as the “honest” president still loudly ring true today.
Lincoln’s time period was saturated with a Congress firmly divided on a contentious issue with neither side willing to compromise, and Kushner illustrates their contempt for each other through chilling arguments on the floor of the House. Obviously modern American politics is still inundated with a disturbing lack of bipartisanship, and Kushner seems to critique the gap between present parties while optimistically presenting the hope that politicians can put aside their differences for the advancement of the nation. Though the film is categorized as a period historical drama, Lincoln is very much a film that speaks to the existing society.
The central flaw in Kushner’s script, which prevents Spielberg’s film from reaching that high echelon of classic cinema, is the story’s abrupt completion. Kushner spends the entire film painting an exquisite portrait of Lincoln through the complicated circumstances that surrounded him, yet brings the film to a strange, quick halt. Given a great opportunity to end the story with an impactful emotional punch, a writer of Kushner’s capabilities could have easily incorporated thematic metaphors into Lincoln’s sudden murder and avoided a conclusion that falls flat and lacks true meaning. Lincoln builds to a climactic point of national and cinematic innovation but fails to move beyond this summit.
Nevertheless, the ending only minimally tarnishes the overall success of the film, mainly because Daniel Day-Lewis’ performance as Lincoln is utterly astounding. Viewers have come to expect Day-Lewis’ characteristic transformative portrayals with each role the actor takes on. Day-Lewis has quickly become one of the most respected actors of our time, and this interpretation marks what could easily be the best of his career. To the undiscerning eye, he becomes almost unrecognizable, a testament to Day-Lewis’ dedication to the character and the excellent makeup team. The voice Day-Lewis breathes into Lincoln is high-pitched, which might seem jarring, but instead humanizes the larger-than-life myth of the president. Day-Lewis remains subdued in certain scenes yet forceful in others, displaying the complexities of Lincoln’s character, and his facial expressions beautifully depict the tired and stressed nature of leading a nation. Amazingly, Day-Lewis matches the mannerisms our culture has learned about Lincoln, while personalizing the representation to fit his strengths. And the immense burden thrust upon him during the Civil War is visualized through the supporting figures Kushner chose to highlight. Each supporting cast member also gives a strong performance, especially Tommy Lee Jones as Lincoln’s rival Thaddeus Stevens.
Spielberg’s Lincoln might not be the conventional biopic, but it still expresses huge volumes about the 16th president. With a wonderfully written script and a monumental performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, the film honors one of the greatest American figures while underscoring the consequences of prolonged partisan tension.

It’s been a couple of weeks since I could write that USC won, but Saturday’s 38-17 beatdown of Arizona State finally allows me to be optimistic. The Trojans now sit at 7-3 and can win the Pac-12 South with a victory against UCLA next weekend at the Rose Bowl.
Under pressure · Sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard, who ranks second in tackles on USC with 67, registered his second sack of the season Saturday against Arizona State’s Taylor Kelly and his first since the Colorado game. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Yeah, USC put up 38 points. Sophomore wideout Marqise Lee had his typical 80-yard touchdown grab to go with a couple of long gains on sweeps. But it was the defense — the very defense I belittled last week — that impressed me.
I couldn’t really figure out what it was about what Monte Kiffin’s group did that was out of the ordinary. Most of the same players were in there: senior safety T.J. McDonald, junior cornerback Nickell Robey and senior defensive end Wes Horton all played their normal amounts.
I was stumped until I realized after the second or third sack that USC was blitzing much more than usual.
For the first time in what seemed like years, an opposing quarterback was forced to scramble for his life to avoid getting absolutely smacked.
It has been fairly well chronicled that in their three losses in 2012, the Trojans were largely unable to get pressure on opposing signal callers. And that was made most obvious against Arizona and Oregon, whose up-tempo spread offenses took advantage of quick passes and strong offensive lines to thwart a struggling USC secondary.
But Saturday proved to be a different story. Sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard applied pressure. Sophomore Dion Bailey did, too. Linebackers and defensive backs were flying around the offensive backfield, making plays on Arizona State quarterback Taylor Kelly that led to three interceptions, two of which came in the fourth quarter. For the first time all season, the Trojans held a spread offense to under 30 points.
Is it possible the Trojans have figured it out?
Have they realized that the key to beating the spread offense isn’t to sit back and give them small receptions, but to be aggressive and force the offense into mistakes? It certainly seems that way. And it’s a good thing, too. Because, as the cliche goes, there is no rest for the weary.
The Bruins run a spread offense and do a pretty decent job of doing so. They feature running back Johnathan Franklin, whose 1,270 rushing yards lead the conference, and a freshman quarterback named Brett Hundley who is rewriting UCLA record books. UCLA averages 37 points per game and, if not handled properly, could give a beleaguered USC defense problems.
The following week, the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame come to town. No, their offense isn’t exactly striking fear into the hearts of opponents currently, as they have been held to 21 points or less in six of their 10 contests and average a mediocre 26.7 points per game. But nonetheless, Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly also runs a version of the spread offense and they feature a mobile quarterback who can make things happen in Everett Golson.
With these spread offense teams coming up, maybe some blitzes from Monte and Co. wouldn’t be such an awful idea. It sure seemed to work against the Sun Devils on Saturday. Kelly looked flustered during the latter portions of the game and Arizona  State couldn’t find any sort of rhythm in the second half of the game because of the pressure.
Because the spread offense relies heavily on the quarterback, it is crucial to apply pressure by whatever means necessary. Clearly, the front four weren’t doing it against Arizona and Oregon; Matt Scott and Marcus Mariota moved around and gave themselves time to throw. But when rushed, quarterbacks make mistakes. Interceptions are thrown. Fumbles happen. Generally speaking, putting pressure on an opposing quarterback is always a good thing.
Clearly, the team had success blitzing the spread offense against the Sun Devils. Why not do it against UCLA and Notre Dame, too? Base defenses weren’t working against other spread offenses. They might as well give it a shot. And if things go well and the Trojans win next week, they’ll likely get to blitz another spread offense in the Pac-12 title game: Oregon.
Who knows? Maybe with pressure on him, Mariota doesn’t throw four touchdowns. Maybe the Ducks make some mistakes. Anything is possible when an offense is disturbed from its normal rhythm. And that is exactly what USC has to do from here on out against these spread offenses: force them to be faster than they want to be, no matter how fast they normally are.
If the Trojans can pressure their next few opponents like they did Arizona State, they will win out. I can almost guarantee it. Whether they decide to do that, however, won’t be known until game day against the Bruins.
One thing is certain, though: With both teams winning this weekend, Saturday’s matchup with UCLA just became more intriguing than anyone would’ve anticipated before the season began.

Monte Kiffin’s battered baseball cap tilted over his brow as he glanced toward the ground.
“It’s hard to talk about Oregon right now,” mumbled the Trojans’ assistant head coach for defense when last week’s performance was brought up.
Hard to explain · Junior wide receiver Robert Woods, pictured here after his pass interference penalty, finished with two catches for -3 yards. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Understandably, it was hard to talk about Oregon. Just seven days earlier, Kiffin’s defense had surrendered school single-game records for points allowed, 62, and yards allowed, 730, in a primetime, nationally televised showdown against the No. 4 Ducks.
So Saturday’s homecoming game versus Arizona State at the Coliseum represented an opportunity for USC to turn the page and begin anew. And at last, after consecutive losses, something clicked on the defensive side.
The Trojans’ defense only surrendered 10 points and 250 total yards, including three points — a 28-yard field goal from Jon Mora — and 76 yards in the second half.
“We’re not the Steel Curtain by any means,” Kiffin said, alluding to the famed Pittsburgh Steelers defenses of the 1970s, “but that sure felt good today.”
The 250 yards allowed was USC’s lowest total for any game all season, equaling the same mark set during a Sept. 22 contest against California and a far cry from the 1,318 yards surrendered in its previous two losses. And similar to its victory over Cal, No. 19 USC (7-3, 5-3) was able to win in convincing fashion, 38-17.
“I feel like we got better today,” said freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams, who finished with one of the team’s seven sacks. “That’s the biggest thing.”
Woods a little off
It might’ve been yet another Heisman Trophy-like performance for sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, who caught 10 passes for 161 yards and one touchdown, but it was far from a banner day for the Trojans’ other dynamic receiver Robert Woods. The junior wide receiver logged his worst statistical performance of the season, with just two receptions for -3 yards.
“I wish I was making more plays, of course,” Woods said. “But other than that, I’m proud of Marqise for making those plays.”
On the season, Woods has caught 61 passes for 653 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Lee attributed the drop in production Saturday to circumstances and the fact defenses still “always play” to Woods.
“He gives himself up for me, basically,” said Lee, a former high school teammate of Woods at Junipero Serra in Gardena, Calif.
“He’s human. You want the ball. You play receiver, you want the ball,” added Kiffin on Woods’ performance. “It was nothing negative. Just, from our relationship, I could feel him. He was a little bit down.”
Deflated footballs
USC announced late Wednesday it had been reprimanded and fined $25,000 by the Pac-12 after a student manager had intentionally deflated game footballs below NCAA-mandated pressure levels during a Nov. 4 game against Oregon.
The school subsequently fired the manager.
When asked during the post-game news conference if the ordeal had served as a distraction among players in the days leading up to Saturday’s game, senior quarterback and captain Matt Barkley insisted it hadn’t.
“I don’t think players were really talking about it in the locker room or anything like that,” Barkley said. “There’s attention on it in social media or what the media pushes out but we weren’t talking about it.”
When further questioned if he had been aware of the deflation, he responded “no.”
“I didn’t know anything was going on and I can’t tell the difference,” Barkley said.
Drop in penalties
For much of the season, USC has been the most penalized team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, but for the second straight week, it put a damper on this lingering problem. The Trojans were only penalized four times against Arizona State for 30 yards. The week prior versus Oregon, the team was penalized three times for 25 yards.
Quick hits
– Junior running back Silas Redd did not play against Arizona State. Lane Kiffin announced he was “not available.” USC does not publicly disclose injury information.
– Saturday’s game at the Coliseum was the earliest kick off time for a USC game since 1998.                                                                                        – Announced attendance was listed at 80,154.

USC coach Lane Kiffin described it as continued “bad karma” in a week filled with controversy after a student manager was fired for deflating game balls during the first half of last Saturday’s defensive debacle against Oregon, resulting in a fine by the Pac-12.
Pulling away · Freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams, known for his pass rushing and disruptive capabilities, clinched the win with a fourth-quarter interception that he returned 24 yards. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Only 45 minutes before kickoff, sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee entered Kiffin’s office with a swollen face after suffering an allergic reaction to something he ate. Kiffin figured there was no chance the star wideout would recover in time for the game.
But Lee received sufficient treatment and emerged out of the Coliseum tunnel with his teammates in time for another transcendent performance — catching 10 passes for 161 yards and adding 66 yards on the ground — buoying No. 19 USC (7-3, 5-3) to a 38-17 win over Arizona State.
“He’s every bit deserving,” senior quarterback Matt Barkley said of Lee’s recent Heisman buzz. “He’s the best player in his position. He’s done some tremendous things this year as a receiver and kick returner and across the board.”
Down 7-0 in the first quarter, Barkley completed an 80-yard touchdown strike to Lee, in which the sophomore sensation knifed through double-coverage and outran his pursuers, gliding into the end zone after junior wide receiver Robert Woods supplied one final block.
“I’m going, ‘This really can’t be happening,’” Kiffin said when recounting Lee’s pregame visit. “As well as he played, that long touchdown pass isn’t even contested if he’s feeling himself. He’s arguably the best player in college football.”
The comfortable final victory margin and Lee’s continued fireworks belied what began as a competitive game in which the Trojans returned to the locker room at halftime amid a smattering of boos tied with the Sun Devils at 14 points apiece.
“I don’t really hear it,” Barkley said when asked about the boos entering halftime. “I kind of block out the noise, so I don’t hear those.”
USC committed three turnovers in the first half, including two interceptions to punctuate drives where the Trojans were poised to score touchdowns.
On the ensuing kickoff after Lee’s 80-yard score, senior linebacker Tony Burnett forced a fumble, which redshirt freshman linebacker Anthony Sarao recovered at the Sun Devils’ 29-yard line. Barkley threw an interception on the next play, however, as linebacker Chris Young made a sprawling catch on the sideline that was upheld after Kiffin’s challenge.
Arizona State’s next possession ended prematurely on senior safety T.J. McDonald’s second interception of the season, but Barkley and the USC offense proceeded to squander the short field opportunity. After a Woods offensive pass interference penalty negated a touchdown and a delay of game penalty set up a third-and-24 situation, Barkley threw a 76-yard pick-six to safety Alden Darby on a swing pass.
Undeterred, USC struck back to conclude the first half on a 13-play, 79-yard drive that culminated in a four-yard touchdown pass to sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble.
“We know what the standards are here,” Kiffin said. “Coming up the tunnel with an Arizona State player I know well, we’re getting booed off the field with it as a tied game at half, and the player gave me a look; well, it is what it is, that’s L.A.”
The second half also began inauspiciously for USC, as Barkley threw his third interception on a pass tipped by onrushing defensive end Carl Bradford, who corralled the deflection as he fell to the ground. The play marked only the second time in his career that Barkley has thrown three interceptions in a game, with the last coming against Stanford in his freshman season in 2009.
Arizona State later capitalized on USC’s fourth turnover with a 28-yard field goal. The Sun Devils’ third score would mark the last time they notched points on the scoreboard, however, as the Trojans proceeded to score 24 unanswered points to bury the Sun Devils.
Senior running back Curtis McNeal emerged as the catalyst behind USC’s second-half surge. With Silas Redd unavailable, the Trojans’ other returning 1,000-yard rusher ran for 112 of his game-high 163 yards in the second half.
“It felt good,” McNeal said. “I’m worried about getting a ‘W’ even if I don’t get the ball.”
In addition to a 5-yard rushing touchdown, McNeal nimbly broke a couple of ankle tackles in the third quarter on a short screen pass that he ultimately converted into a 22-yard touchdown reception. Surprisingly, the two scores marked the only times he has visited the end zone in 2012.
“A lot of credit to the offensive line and Curtis, he had a great game except for the fumble at the end,” Kiffin said. “If you look at the hidden stats, the negative plays … Curtis only lost one yard today.”
The embattled defensive unit arguably put forth its best performance of the season, especially considering seven of the points surrendered came from Barkley’s pick-six in the second quarter. USC’s defensive front-seven, which was gashed by the Ducks’ rushing attack, rebounded nicely, registering seven sacks for 56 yards split between six defenders.
“Our guys were really more aggressive,” Kiffin said. “Not in defensive calls, but really the front-seven.”
The vaunted Sun Devils’ offense picked up a mere 71 yards on 35 carries. Moreover, USC stole three interceptions from Arizona State quarterback Taylor Kelly, who ranked third in the Pac-12 in passing efficiency entering the contest.
“It’s been rough, just because of the type of defense we are and the type of players we have,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “Others teams have gotten the best of us. … We needed to get that nasty taste out of our mouths.”
USC’s defense helped the team survive the “sandwich game” test between its nationally hyped heavyweight bout against Oregon and its rivalry showdown at UCLA this Saturday at noon.

The Supreme Court agreed last week to review a case that will decide whether or not law enforcement can collect DNA samples from all people arrested for, but not yet convicted of, violent crimes. Though this might seem like a rational way to investigate and prevent crime, civil liberties advocates are concerned that this kind of policy paves the way for a Big Brother-like state that collects the genetic information of all citizens, law abiding or not.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
All 50 states currently collect DNA, whether a saliva or blood sample, from those who have been convicted of felonies. More than half of the states, including California, take this one step further and require violent crime suspects — typically those who have been arrested on rape, murder or assault charges — to submit to a mouth swab or blood sample despite the fact that they have not yet been proven guilty in a court of law.
Judges in many states that currently support this policy have questioned whether it violates the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as outlined by the Fourth Amendment, which says “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” If we are to avoid the growth of an overly invasive justice system and surveillance state by the time our generation inherits the duties of exacting justice, such a collection of very personal information must be struck down as unconstitutional.
The issue came to the immediate attention of the Supreme Court following the overturning of the rape conviction of a Maryland man, Alonzo King, on the basis of DNA evidence. Authorities collected DNA from King upon his arrest for an unrelated assault charge but found it matched with an unsolved rape from years earlier. The judges in the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned the rape conviction by citing a violation of the exclusionary rule, a clause that holds that evidence obtained by the prosecution outside the parameters of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible and must be thrown out.
What the Supreme Court will deliberate in Maryland v. King is whether allowing states greater capacities to fight crime outweighs the need to protect the privacy of individuals.
Though law enforcement is no doubt a vital function of the state and must be kept as a priority in government, it is even more vital that it doesn’t overstep the boundaries set by the Constitution that were put in place to counteract the potential for state tyranny over the individual. Given the very personal nature of DNA samples, it is not too much of a stretch to claim that allowing laws, such as the one that originally led to King’s conviction, would constitute such a violation.
California passed a similar law in 2009, but it is even more intrusive than the one up for debate in the Supreme Court. Unlike in Maryland, samples collected from California citizens who are released or acquitted of their charges are not automatically thrown out, meaning that their genealogy is available for usage by law enforcement regardless of their determined innocence. A decision by the Supreme Court against Maryland would likely render such a law unconstitutional.
Advocates of these laws undoubtedly have a compelling point. Having DNA information available to state and federal law enforcement agencies would greatly assist in apprehending criminals and make prosecution of the true perpetrators easier. As ideal as that would be, however, the state cannot be the keeper of its citizens’ complete biological profiles.
As society moves further into the 21st century, it is difficult not to take advantage of enhanced scientific capabilities at the expense of long-established principles of just governance. Maryland v. King puts this dilemma to the test. For the sake of the individual’s right to privacy now and in future generations, the Court must rule against such tempting shortcuts to criminal justice.

The headline here is sloppy and misleading. Being arrested does not make someone a ‘criminal’. Also, genealogy does not mean quite what the author appears to think: it’s the study of families and their history, not information about the genotype. Perhaps The Daily Trojan needs more lawyers and English majors (or even biologists or historians) and fewer political science majors.

Watching news coverage of the 2012 presidential election, it seemed there was one particular group political pundits could not stop talking about: Latino voters.
Latino support for President Barack Obama was overwhelmingly evident as he captured 71 percent of the Latino vote as opposed to Republican challenger Mitt Romney’s 27 percent. Perhaps more important than the overall numbers, though, is the fact that Latino voters have been credited with helping Obama secure a second term by providing him key victories in swing states such as Nevada and Colorado.
Recognizing the growing presence and importance of Latino voters, two things are clear: Obama must deliver on an immigration reform plan in his second term, and it is in the best interest of the GOP to reach across the aisle to the president and Congressional Democrats to do so.
Politicians make and break promises all the time, and Obama is no exception. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama promised that he would enact an immigration reform policy during his first term in office. Though he signed an executive order in June that provides two-year work permits to people who entered the U.S. illegally as children and meet certain criteria, this was far from the sweeping immigration reform Latino voters hoped for.
Latino voters might have forgiven Obama for failing to make significant improvements to the U.S. immigration policy during his first term in office, but they will not be so easy to forgive the Democratic Party if he fails to do so the second time around. The Latino vote will only become more coveted as time passes, and Republicans will be quick to remind voters of any Democratic shortcomings.
Though Obama and Congressional Democrats are partially responsible for the lack of immigration reform, the GOP’s unwavering anti-immigration stance is accountable for the problem as well. Throughout the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney, perhaps in an effort to woo white male voters, consistently reaffirmed his anti-immigration stance — at the expense of the Latino vote. Feeling alienated and ostracized, many Latinos shifted their support to the Democratic Party. This was especially the case with the historically Republican Cuban-American demographic: According to the Los Angeles Times, Obama and Romney tied for Cuban-American votes in Florida -— and the final vote in Florida ended in favor of Obama, 49-47.
Many GOP members themselves regret not having done enough to court Latino voters. “We have a Latino problem that just cost us a national election,” GOP strategist Mike Murphy told Politico.
Simply put, if Republicans in Congress continue to block immigration reform plans, the party’s problem of resonating with Latino voters will only persist.
Clearly, it is in the best interest of Democrats and Republicans to make immigration reform a top legislative priority. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has acknowledged the urgency and importance of immigration reform, saying he would introduce immigration legislation next year.There are signs of hope that such legislation could be passed: “I’m confident that the president, myself, others can find the common ground to take care of this issue once and for all,” Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) recently told ABC News.
Compromise between the president, Democrats and Republicans is vital to immigration reform. Though Latinos do not expect complete amnesty for illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States, a viable pathway to citizenship is necessary. The DREAM Act would be a reasonable start for immigration reform, as it would provide law-abiding, undocumented youth with a six-year-long pathway to citizenship if they attain a college degree or serve in the armed forces for two years.
Beyond the DREAM Act, special efforts must also be made to keep families intact. Empathy, and to some extent sympathy, must be displayed in immigration reform plan. After all, it is unreasonable to expect a 14-year-old U.S.-born citizen to stay in the country where he or she was raised while his or her father and mother are deported.
With the 2012 election over, Obama and Democrats owe it to Latino voters to act on immigration reform promptly. But doing so will require cooperation from Republicans, who must see how softening their stance on immigration and working adamantly to pass a satisfactory reform bill will give them returns from voters in the future.
It’s all a process to adjust to a changing electorate, one in which the Latino vote is not only helpful but necessary. Politicians be warned: Latino voters recognize their increasing political power and will be watching both parties closely.

I’m sorry, but I don’t buy the “sympathy” crap. It is not the fault of the United States for the actions of parents that willingly broke our laws by immigrating illegally.
If we go towards an amnesty-based approach, what’s to stop those outside the United States from coming in illegally, knowing that eventually they will be provided for one way or another? The MOTIVATION to break our laws need to be modified.
It’s not that I’m against immigrants entirely. What I am intolerant of is those who choose to do come illegally, no matter how romantic it may seem. What really needs to be reformed are our processes for LEGAL immigration.
These immigrants are already giving the middle finger to our laws by deliberately breaking them. It’s worse and even insulting when they ride around in buses and blatantly protest as if they were the Freedom Riders.
NO amnest NO dream act!?
