Sports are an art.
They really are.
Sometimes we lose sight of that, with our focus as fans going toward making the playoffs or qualifying for the national championship game. We forget why we were attracted to sports in the first place.
Artist in cleats · USC safety Taylor Mays left fans awestruck with his play last Saturday against Cal, columnist Pedro Moura writes. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Plain and simple, it’s because the things athletes can do with their feet, their hands, their brains, are amazing.
And every once in a while you get a reminder that, wow, sports really are an art and athletes really are artists in their own right.
Take Saturday, for example.
There were two supreme examples of artistry.
Exhibit A: Taylor Mays sketched out the perfect interception.
Exhibit B: Damian Williams drew an awe-inspiring punt return.
In A, Cal was driving, splicing through the Trojan defense with no problems. Every USC fan surely had thoughts of, “This again?”
A Bear touchdown would have been killer. Then Mays — a guy who’s faced criticism for accumulating only four career interceptions to that point — stepped in front of Cal’s wide receiver Marvin Jones and made the leaping grab. Cal quarterback Kevin Riley was never the same, completing only 13-of-36 passes for 156 yards from that point on.
Talk about the right time to come up big. I cannot stress enough the importance of that interception.
After the game, linebacker Chris Galippo shook his head for a good five seconds when asked to explain how crucial the interception was.
He proceeded to utter a nicely balanced mix of superlatives — basically the professional way to say “wow.”
And Williams’ punt return — again, talk about having a sense for the right time to break one.
Cal’s Bryan Anger punted the ball seven times in the contest. Williams called for a fair catch on every single one — save for the touchdown of course. He knew just the right time to keep his hands down and catch the ball. Watching the play again, you see Williams look to the right and look to the left in the split-second before taking off to the left. You see him utilize blockers exactly the way your high school coaches told you to: juke twice and accelerate.
Quick interjection — Williams owes Cal’s D.J. Holt for how badly he abused Holt on that play.
No, seriously. Watch it again if you can. Holt is No. 3, the linebacker who looks like he doesn’t belong on the same playing field with USC’s No. 18.
But don’t tell me that Williams’ tiptoe down the ’SC sideline wasn’t an art form. It most certainly was.
As you can see, each step is clearly planned. Williams looks down at his feet every other step to make sure he’s staying inbounds, then leaps with an outstretched right arm — while the rest of his body is flailing out of play — to graze the pylon and score the touchdown.
Williams laughed when asked if his precise movements were intended. Of course they were, he said.
And you don’t have to look far to find other amazing plays.
Look at Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews’ strip against the Vikings on Monday. With his team trailing by a touchdown in their biggest game of the season to date, Matthews swoops in on the most dominating American football player in the world today — “Purple Jesus,” Adrian Peterson — and steals the ball from his grasp. He went on to run it back for a score, tying the game and quieting a raucous Metrodome crowd. The Packers still went on to lose, but don’t tell me that play wasn’t important.
And — just so you don’t think I’m a flaming USC supporter — I’ll give you an example of art on the other side of the spectrum.
New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez  had been hyped like nobody’s business in the first three weeks of football this season.
His Jets were driving in the red zone, down only 3-0 at the start of the second quarter. Sanchez saw his tight end, Dustin Keller, break on a slant into the end zone. He delivered the pass, only to have veteran Saints safety Darren Sharper pick it off and return it 99 yards the other way for a score.
You could say that Sanchez was rattled from that point on — he posted a 27.0 QB rating. The Saints went on to win by a margin of 14 points — exactly what that interception was worth as it took away a potential Jets touchdown and created a Saints one.
Sharper told the Associated Press afterwards that he almost wanted to stop and watch the play unfold around him after he picked the ball off. Then he realized he had a touchdown — a piece of art, if you will — to complete.
And that’s why we watch sports.

Last weekend, while many local music fans trekked to Eagle Rock for the free, all-ages music festival, a smaller amount of LA audiophiles made the drive out to Joshua Tree for an entirely different aural experience. Held at Pappy and Harriet’s Pioneertown Palace — a true saloon on the fringes of a fake “Western” town built by Hollywood directors and actors in the 1940s — the second annual Manimal Fest brought some of the city’s most unusual underground acts to a cell phone reception dead zone. The two-day, two-stage, 20-plus band lineup created a multifaceted desert playlist that sonically decries its collective urban beginnings.
By 4 p.m. Saturday, Pappy and Harriet’s was serving up booze-filled mason jars and homestyle BBQ grub while attendees poured into the unpaved backyard corral to hear the laptop-assisted Talking Heads harmonies of Pizza!, the delay-heavy post-apocalyptic Power Rangers safari that is WEAVE! and the psychedelic sounds of Rainbow Arabia’s unrestrained global fusion.
High desert· Among the LA bands playing the second annual Manimal Festival Saturday were Corridor (left), WEAVE! (right) and Fool’s Gold (bottom). For more photos from the festival, visit dailytrojan.com. - Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan
As the wind picked up and the sun dropped into a cloudless, bright orange dusk, Corridor’s multi-instrumentalist Michael Quinn sat center stage. Surrounded by boards stuffed with distortion, reverb and looping pedals, the one-man band masterfully crafted his haunting epics by adding textured layers of repeated live cello and guitar-playing over ethereal pre-stored beats, building momentum one riff at a time until the gusts of swirling sand around him made it hard to tell where the paranormal music ended and the enigma of the surrounding desert began.
Inside the main restaurant — a spacious, wooden honky tonk — the early evening was filled with the less-alienating side of Manimal Fest. While the women wearing ponchos over thrift store dresses and men dressed like extras from Almost Famous confused Pappy and Harriet’s Saturday evening regulars, the Misty Mountain Bluegrass Band and folk-based Amanda Jo Williams swept the locals through dinner hour.
After sunset, the temperature dropped. Although there were portable space heaters scattered around the outdoor area, the heavy afro-pop 12-piece ensemble Fool’s Gold became the crowd’s saving grace, forcing those watching to keep close and gyrate hard as the band’s three guitars, one saxophone and slew of tribal percussion came together as if Broken Social Scene and Tinariwen were simultaneously playing a show at a synogague on a Native American reservation. After Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes — another crowded stage effort featuring several members of Fool’s Gold — played upbeat cult jams through the 11 p.m. outdoor curfew, everyone moved inside for a fog-machine-filled Hecuba dance party and the final show of the night, an unintelligible half-hour of poppy-electronic weirdness from Laco$te.
While the music industry frets over radio airplay, national tours and iTunes sales, Manimal is busy bringing some of LA’s most eclectic bands to Pioneertown, a place that exists outside of strict venue security and overpriced bar specials. From one-man symphonies to a soccer team’s worth of drumbeats, the annual festival is a place where judgments rest on sound, not marketing, and the music is free to be as unpredictable as the desert itself.

RoJo’s back.
Just five weeks after suffering a broken collarbone, junior receiver Ronald Johnson returned to practice Tuesday and is on track to play in the Notre Dame game Oct. 17.
Back in action · Coming off a clavicle break, Ronald Johnson wore a non-contact yellow jersey at his first practice since suffering the injury.- Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
After practice, USC coach Pete Carroll gushed about having the 6-foot, 190-pound speedster back.
“It’s great to have him back,” Carroll said. “He’s got great speed, great playmaking ability, knows our system so well, and he makes other guys play well and he’ll make things happen for us.”
Johnson wore a yellow jersey in practice Tuesday to avoid contact, but teammates said he still made a big impact.
“It was huge, just for the little time that he was out here,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said. “You could tell — his spirit, his way of playing — he’s back and it’s awesome.”
Johnson beat the six- to eight-week prognosis for his injury, but he likely won’t be practicing fully until next Monday.
“I’ve been out for like five weeks, so it feels good to be back out there running and catching and playing with the guys a little bit,” Johnson said. “I feel like I’m back.”
Johnson was expected to be the Trojans’ starting flanker this season after hauling in 33 receptions for 570 yards a season ago. He’s also a team leader of sorts for USC.
“It’s fun,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “Everybody loves RoJo. He’s such a great worker and he contributes so much to the tempo of practice and the playmaking and all that.”
u
A few other Trojans are on the mend this week.
Sophomore defensive end Armond Armstead also returned to practice Tuesday. He had missed six weeks after breaking his left foot at fall camp.
Armstead had been penciled in as a starting defensive end before the injury, but he was forced to watch from the sidelines with a large boot on his foot during the team’s 4-1 start.
“On X-rays you can’t even see the fracture anymore,” Armstead said. “It’s healed, so there’s not really much worry about reinjuring it.”
The injury originally occurred when linebacker Shane Horton stepped on Armstead’s foot during a drill.
“Armstead is scheduled to play next week, but he is further behind because he was unable to condition his lower body [while he was injured],” Carroll said. “He feels great and wants to do it, but we just gotta get him back in shape.”
Junior linebacker Malcolm Smith is also healthy again. He missed the last two games with a high ankle sprain, but returned to practice Tuesday.
Carroll said Smith could have played against Cal had it been an emergency situation.
Added Carroll: “He’s looking like he’ll be ready to compete next week.”
u
Another goal of the bye week for the Trojans is to develop the younger talent on the roster.
Seven freshmen have seen playing time so far this season, but Carroll said they could have an even bigger influence.
“What we’re trying to do with this bye opportunity is to give a lot of guys chances to see where they fit in,” Carroll said. “We’re trying to help the young guys elevate.”
Carroll specifically highlighted a quintet of freshman — receiver De’Von Flournoy, offensive linemen Kevin Graf and John Martinez and safeties T.J. McDonald, and Jawanza Starling — as those who the coaching staff is hoping to get a good look this week.
“We’re just trying to find out what they know and what they don’t know,” Carroll said. “It’s all the new guys, the young guys. We want to see how far we can take them.”
u
Carroll also said the kicking competition would be renewed at placekicker, with redshirt junior Joe Houston challenging the incumbent, senior Jordan Congdon.
“With the kicking game, we’re opening up competition for the placekicking, just because it looks like the guys are just about neck-and-neck again,” Carroll said. “We’re gonna see that go through.”
Congdon has made six of eight field goal attempts this season.

This is not the stuff of musicals.
Gruesome murder, racism in the South, unseemly politicking, media sensationalism, official corruption, Messianism, public morality — rarely are such weighty issues even considered as themes for musicals, a genre serious theatergoers regularly denigrate for its bubbly superficiality and lack of profundity. Musicals are to theater what romance novels are to fiction: the bane of the art form, and self-indulgent excursions into a temporary state of mindlessness.
Deep South · Lara Pulver and and Grey’s Anatomy’s T.R. Knight star as husband and wife in Parade, now playing at the Mark Taper Forum. The musical’s dark themes and minimalist design makes it a standout. - Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz
At least, that is their reputation. But Parade is surely a case in point.
There are no happy endings, elaborate sets or flashy production numbers here. Parade is one of those all-too-rare works of striking theatrical minimalism.
Parade, which first opened on Broadway in 1998, recounts a real-life American tragedy: the case of Leo Frank, played here by T.R. Knight (formerly George on Grey’s Anatomy). In 1913, Frank, a Jewish businessman who grew up in Brooklyn, was convicted of raping and killing 13-year-old Mary Phagan, one of the several young girls who worked for pennies at Frank’s pencil factory in Atlanta. The state’s governor later commuted Frank’s death sentence to life in prison, even though Frank was in all likelihood innocent.
The case — made into a cause célèbre by a sensationalist yellow press — is widely regarded as one of the gravest missteps of justice in American history, and an example of blatant anti-Semitism in the South. Frank was later kidnapped and lynched by an angry mob.
The playwrights — Jason Robert Brown composed the Tony Award–winning score and collaborated with Tony Award-winner Alfred Uhry on the script — take a few historical liberties with the plot, but the original story remains largely intact. The question, of course, is: Why a musical?
Because it works — sensationally. More than a simple retelling of history, Parade elevates Frank’s tragic story to a kind of spiritual profundity, indeed rousing our conscience and startling our propriety. Music, properly employed, can do what mere words can’t, and Brown’s understated score is exquisitely employed. “It Don’t Make Sense,” sung by a young, grieving Frankie Epps (played with heartrending sincerity by Curt Hansen) over the grave of Mary (a graceful Rose Sezniak), succeeds in capturing the mood of a funeral where words would have failed. Few would be able to harden their hearts against such a raw display of emotion and hold back the tears.
But the story is as much about Mary’s death and the subsequent trial as it is about Frank’s strained relationship with his wife, Lucille (Lara Pulver). Knight’s Frank is a neurotic, romantically awkward workaholic who would rather go into work on Confederate Memorial Day than have a picnic with Lucille. But as Frank stands trial and is relentlessly attacked by a racist public, corrupt officials and a sleazy press, Lucille nobly stands by her husband, and, over the course the play, their relationship grows deeper and finally blooms. Frank has to lose nearly everything before he realizes what he had all along — the best partner he could ask for.
Knight lacks stage presence at times, and can’t quite match Pulver vocally, but the show rarely suffers for it. The cast’s accent work is generally inconsistent, but Knight is a believable Brooklyn Jew (the Yiddish intonation helps).
Other performers can’t quite suppress the urge to overplay their parts. P.J. Griffith, angrily belting out big notes and constantly throwing his arms heavenward, confuses his Tom Watson, the religious zealot who galvanizes the town against Frank, with someone from The Phantom of the Opera. Christian Hoff’s Hugh Dorsey, the prosecutor in the trial, plays it far too cool.
By contrast, Deidrie Henry and David St. Louis, both who play more than one part (as do others in the cast, which, along with the occasionally uneven script, can be very confusing), are both revelations — especially during their duet, “A Rumblin’ and a Rollin,’” which opens the second act. They wonder whether the death of a black child would have caused a similar outcry — a question that many still pose today.
The actual trial is a terrifying scene. Each of the witnesses were probably coached by Dorsey, which is especially clear in “The Factory Girls/Come up to My Office,” where the factory girls each recount, in spine-chilling similarity, Frank’s sexual interest in them. When Frank is sentenced to death, the town leaps to its feet in a grotesque cakewalk, eerily lit by Neil Austin’s effective and sometimes cleverly ironic lighting and underscored by Jon Weston’s dramatic sound design.
This slightly modified version of the 1998 original  is expertly directed by Rob Ashford, who uses Christopher Oram’s minimalist scenic design — a two-story structure that serves every setting need, prison to ballroom — and period-appropriate costuming to great effect. And not enough can be said of Brown’s music and lyrics. There are no showstopping numbers, and very few chances for the sort of vocal acrobatics that people have come to expect of Broadway shows. Instead, we are treated to a moving score, built on ostinatos, that combines pop and gospel influences into a wondrous beauty. It makes the show what it is: A musical to rival anything that has come out of the theater — musical or not — in recent years.

“Will you read my screenplay?”
This question, sometimes edited slightly to involve reading a novel or viewing a piece of art, haunts friends of those in the creative industry. It is the ultimate test and requires an important decision: honesty or friendship?
Reality check · Bryce Johnson stars as a screenwriter in The Blue Tooth Virgin, which centers around the deception prevalent in Hollywood. - Photo courtesy of Regent Releasing
The new film The Blue Tooth Virgin — winner of the 2008 New American Cinema Special Jury Prize — focuses on the fine line between telling the truth and maintaining a relationship with another individual. Purchased by Regent Films immediately after its premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival, this independent comedy-drama delves into the complicated nature of Hollywood friendships.
After reading a screenplay given to him by an old friend, David (Bryce Johnson) realizes the text is absolutely horrible. He must now choose whether to tell Sam (Austin Peck) the truth or let him be publicly humiliated. The movie continues like a play, taking a nod from Éric Rohmer, with eight dialogues beautifully shot with a Panasonic VariCam in various locations around Los Angeles. While the constant discussion can become a bit heavy and lengthy, the film is well written and offers many valuable lessons if you are motivated to listen.
The writer, producer and director of the film, Russell Brown, earned a bachelor’s degree in critical studies and a master’s in screenwriting from USC. Because of his background, he understands the politics of Hollywood. It is clear that The Blue Tooth Virgin caters to an audience that appreciates the drama that goes into making a film, though everyone can identify with the issues presented. References to “production hell” and jokes about the horrors of screenwriting may slip by any student who has not sat through Drew Casper’s introduction to cinema course, but if you have ever spoken to a film student, you will recognize Sam’s anger when David divulges that he thinks. the screenplay is less than perfect.
Through showing how difficult it is to write and revise a screenplay, the audience sees another side of Hollywood. Unlike many movies that depict glorified streets lined with palm trees and stars, The Blue Tooth Virgin portrays the gritty side of the city and the struggle to be successful.
Although the film focuses on friendship in the midst of constructive criticism, it also takes on the age-old quest of attempting to determine exactly who you want to be, regardless of other people’s beliefs and the need to be successful. While this concept could be difficult to tackle, Brown does it with ease by weaving comical and blunt conversations between strong characters. The two main characters, David and Sam, serve as idealists for both sides of the movie industry. One is focused on the need to produce art while the other believes purely in the art of entertainment. This discrepancy provides a realistic conflict that all artists face. Additionally, Karen Black, a veteran independent film actress, provides the most outrageous performance as a highly paid script consultant. Along with these intriguing characters, relevant quotations are interspersed throughout the film. They appear in between conversations and serve as a link between them. Though catered to those familiar with the difficulties of writing, these quotations are humorous and add another level to the movie.
Despite its clear connection to those already in the film industry or aspiring moviemakers, The Blue Tooth Virgin will elicit some sort of emotion from every audience member. Whether it is frustration with Sam, who is in fact rather frustrating, or knowing how difficult it is to tell your friend/boyfriend/brother that his screenplay does indeed suck, there is something in this film for everyone. Though at times it seems as if Brown is testing out shots he learned in the halls of USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, The Blue Tooth Virgin’s cinematography is beautiful.
As the film demonstrated by its festival acclaim, The Blue Tooth Virgin is a strong independent production that, in its simple, straightforward fashion, sheds some light on just how to reply to that daunting question of whether to criticize or remain safely in the bounds of friendship.

Courtney Fortune’s hard work is paying off.
When the Daily Trojan spoke with Fortune as a freshman, she was just beginning to explore the fiercely competitive LA jazz scene where she has since blossomed.

“Luckily I was able to find my team of people and meet a wonderful producer; it makes LA a lot smaller,” she said with confidence in a recent interview.
The petite blonde powerhouse traces her formidable drive for musical self-cultivation to her artistically inclined upbringing.
“My parents told me, ‘You can do anything you want, but you got to take the right steps,’” Fortune said.
It’s undeniable that she has relentlessly followed through. From gigs at Seattle jazz clubs to performances in Japan, Fortune has crafted a tremendous vocal talent and forged lasting connections within the industry.
Chris Walden is one of those connections. After meeting Fortune at an Oscar party, Walden allowed her to rehearse with his big band, and eventually agreed to produce her debut album. The product of this collaboration, Speak Love, reaches what Fortune calls “a place of honesty” in expressing emotions and experiences best conveyed through sharp original songwriting.
Her audience is a lively mixed bag: College-aged fans and older jazz enthusiasts alike come to hear her sultry blend of melodic pop and mournful torch songs. She has also developed a following in the gay community, which she attributes to the incorporation of jazz’s more glamorous elements into her performance style.
“I’ve always been an old soul,” Fortune said. “I draw upon a lot of 1920s and 1940s influences and modernize them.”
The proof is in her music; Speak Love delves into the bitterness of heartbreak with a distinctly nostalgic flair, a smooth homage to timeless jazz greats embellished with Fortune’s distinctive pop fusion.
“I want to steer my own career and be a part of every facet of production,” Fortune said,
Her music industry major has empowered her to “bypass all of the LA crazies and false promises” that can lure new artists into raw deals.
Fortune experienced deception first hand.
“I got mixed up with some potential major label business and people pushing me in a different ‘edgier’ direction, but at the end of the day it’s extremely exhausting to be something you’re not — if it doesn’t feel right, it’s not worth it,” she explained in an email.
Her first music video puts a decidedly homespun feel on “Close the Door,” a folksy pop track.
“I wanted to get back to my Northwestern roots,” she said of searching for a location that fit the part of the rural landscape of her hometown. The resulting no-frills video was shot in the Angeles National Forest months before wildfires destroyed the set.
Fortune’s prodigious efforts have not gone unnoticed. This month, she is featured in Glamour Magazine’s Top 10 College Women of 2009.
“It was a reflection of my character, my volunteer work and who I am as a person,” rather than just grades or awards, she said. Fortune traveled to New York and met the other winners, which gave her a great feeling of female empowerment.
“It shows that music isn’t just entertainment,” Fortune explained. “It can inspire and help others.”
She puts this philosophy into practice by devoting her scant free time to the Peapod Foundation, a volunteer organization founded by the Black Eyed Peas to promote music in underprivileged neighborhoods. Exposing children to musical performance is what attracted her to Peapod, which was established earlier this year.
“USC has created so many great opportunities,” she said. “Everything I’m doing now has some link to something I’ve done here.”
The highlight of her Trojan career: performing her original song “It’s Raining in LA” at the 2008 Dickens Dinner in front of legendary Beach Boys songwriter Brian Wilson and famed Motown producer Lamont Dozier.
“I think this next year will be telling,” she said of her future plans.
Fortune is a Trojan original. Charming and unpretentious in conversation, she possesses a tried-and-true confidence refined through exhaustive practice and smart connections.
“I’m kind of strange,” Fortune said with a laugh, scrolling through the songs on her iPod. Right now she is listening to film composer Jon Brion, Feist and Rufus Wainwright.
“I love a good pop song,” she confessed, “I’m attracted to music that tells a story.”
Her own musical story promises to continue. As for those aspiring to follow their passion: “The best advice I’ve ever gotten is that there’s always room at the top for good talent and good music.”
Competent and fun to read.  Nice job.
Really enjoyed this article and being introduced to someone so talented. Thanks!
GREAT MUSIC, GREAT PERSON—-GO USC, WELL DONE.

Amid gold confetti, topless figureheads and raging techno, I experienced my first encounter with San Francisco’s LovEvolution last weekend. In an extravagant parade down Market Street, I saw pink elephants and cage dancers, penis balloons and some Amazonian wilderness. I even witnessed at least eight nude men, each posing for pictures with girls young enough to be their prepubescent grandchildren. Love was all around, as visible as areolas and as palpable as the constant, potent aroma of marijuana in the streets. Oh, the glory of San Francisco.
While waiting for the BART into the city, my friends and I became very aware of exactly how underdressed we were. Where were our fuzzy, colored boots and our fairy wings? Where were our neon-colored wigs, fishnets and booty shorts? At the very least, where were our Teletubbies costumes with accompanying bling-bling?
I certainly did not make this mistake at the release party of Harry Potter’s final installment. Without shame and overwhelmed with excitement, my friends and I planned every last detail of that night with meticulous care. Although there was less nudity and much less marijuana, the parade of teens and preteens celebrating the seventh book was just as decadent as the one that marched and shimmied down Market Street only a few days ago. Confetti, music, costumes, dancing, love — all these things found themselves crammed into every Borders and Barnes & Noble that had the intelligence to host a party in return for an advanced purchase.
And was it a party. When I think back to my senior year, the night that Harry Potter came to an end is the night that I find the most epic, the most collectively memorable — even more so than graduation, which was a tired rundown of secondhand blue robes and graduation speeches inspired by Beatles songs. July 21, 2007 was, to a very large extent, the end of my childhood. I started the Sorcerer’s Stone when I was 10; when I turned 11, despite every screaming ounce of logic, I was disappointed when my birthday came and went with no owl-delivered letter.
When I was 15, I criticized J.K. Rowling’s insensitive and exaggerated treatment of Harry’s puberty-driven angst while I myself lived my life in constant caps-lock fury. And when I was 18, a few months after I graduated high school and a few weeks before I would become a college freshman, I felt an ache that reverberated more deeply than any sense of loss I had previously experienced.
Since then, things have changed. Loved ones passing, first loves dissolving and homes migrating have shifted my sense of what is memorable. But that night, straddling two chapters of my life, I felt a cover fall harshly upon an adventure I associated with my own childhood. It was as if the parade that was Harry Potter had suddenly and rapidly found its end on Market Street.
I hurried home once the book was delivered into my long-awaited arms and read the book from cover to cover before the sun began to rise. I sat and pondered, discussed, analyzed, hated, worshipped and, at the very end, regretted. If only I hadn’t finished it so fast; if only I had taken my time; if only I hadn’t read it at all, then, at the very least, it wouldn’t be over — just like one feels at the close of a parade.
But that is the wonderful thing about parades. They lead to something — a demonstration, an angry mob or, like this weekend, a music festival of moshing electronica. And then after that, there are all-night raves (or, for those who still need to persuade parental consent, all-age dance parties). I was wrong about the resounding finale that was July 21, 2007. Even after that momentous day — and following morning — there were still movies and rumors and soon-to-be-published encyclopedias and, maybe one day, there will even be spin-offs (the Frasier kind, not the That ’80s Show kind). Just like the smell of marijuana that remains etched onto one’s clothing, every memory I associated with those books lingers today. And just like the detached eyes of someone faded from ecstasy, you can always identify — even from a distance — a fellow HP fanatic.
Yes, it’s not the same. I will never be closing that back cover for the first time again; the next naked man painted with shimmering glitter will never again be quite as scandalous. Love will never be as windswept, homes will never be as rooted and loved ones will never return. But isn’t that the beauty of it all? That those closed covers mark another opening pair, arms waiting and welcoming?

There are certain types of news so mind-blowing that you remember every detail about the moment you got word. I was dragging myself through a paper last week when a text hit my phone, informing me that singer Thom Yorke’s new band would feature none other than Flea.
Tickets for the band’s two shows at the downtown Orpheum Theatre sold out within minutes. Monday night, concertgoers knew just how lucky they were.
Idioteque · Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke reveals solo material to audiences at the Orpheum Theatre. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
As anyone who viciously stalks set lists online could have guessed, the band began by playing The Eraser, Yorke’s 2006 solo album, in its entirety. Yorke sat at his piano and played the distinctive chords that jumpstart the record’s title track. The crowd erupted with cheers of excitement and then gradually grew silent, turning into attentive, respectful listeners.
“The Eraser,” which is a dissonant, jarring and electronic song in its recorded form, proved to sound full, layered and ambient with live instrumentation. Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich worked keyboards and effects while former R.E.M. drummer Joey Waronker and Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco offered more than a drum kit ever could. When Yorke stood up and grabbed a guitar, he and Flea teamed up to jam out a fast, funky storm of rock.
Yorke had always said The Eraser was intended to be a dance album, and Flea’s groovy adaption of its baselines certainly solidified his point. The former Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist even put down his primary instrument to play the melodica on “Skip Divided,” turning the track into a Middle Eastern groove that perfectly echoed and improved upon the album version.
Flea picked his bass up again to slap it for a high-intensity version of “Harrowdown Hill” that sent both Yorke and himself into a fit of dancing, shaking their hips and reinventing the moonwalk. The audience remained in a trance, eyes glued to the stage and thoughts who-knows-where. Yorke crooned lyrics that described the audience’s experience perfectly: “I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness.”
When the album was complete, Yorke returned to the stage alone to play three new songs. No one talked — it was like an unspoken rule, an understood fact that Yorke’s genius must be respected. He began with “Lotus Flower” on guitar, a beautiful song that Yorke supposedly has been working on with his band — what is it called again? Radio-something?
Next, Yorke returned to his piano to play “Skirting on the Surface” and “Open the Floodgates,” two more ballads that will be sure to get any listener through a rainy day.
For the first half of the show, all the attendees appeared to be in some state of shock. This was understandable, as they had only been allotted one week to prepare for the show of a lifetime. Furthermore, each at least somewhat expected to leave the show wishing the Orpheum had housed the “actual” Radiohead instead of merely its frontman and his musician friends.
While a notion like this was inevitable, Yorke and his musician friends ended the night with crazy jam sessions and compelling new songs, turning doubters into dancers. It was a different sound than Yorke’s album or even his recent releases, “Feeling Pulled Apart By Horses“ and “A Hollow World,” would have suggested, exemplified by the band’s obscure choice of Radiohead track — haunting B-side “Paperbag Writer.”
Flea’s performance skills helped him embrace the eerie electronic tracks — he danced across the stage, hypnotizing himself and the crowd. Yorke followed Flea’s example, and the two of them went wild, fueled by groove and ambiance, neon lights flashing behind them.
“We’ve had a lot of fun doing this,” Yorke said to the crowd as the show came to a close. “So we’re going to do it again.”

Every Thursday afternoon, I return home from a mentally taxing hour-plus of political philosophy (Marx, anyone?), cozy up in my bed with my laptop, click on my bookmarked link to Hulu and watch the most recent episode of Glee. With this routine, I can get through even the darkest of weeks. Glee, no doubt the greatest thing on TV in recent memory, is the light at the end of my proverbial tunnel.
You might, then, be able to imagine my reaction when I read in Monday’s Los Angeles Times this headline: “Will Hulu make you pay to watch?”
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
If you guessed heartache (or some such variation thereof, like heartbreaking sadness or heartfelt pain), you’d be right. I needed a Kleenex — or eight — to dry my face.
Since I have class Wednesday nights, I can never watch Glee on TV. Hulu, despite its buffering and occasional choppiness at inopportune moments, is the next best thing. The thought of having it taken away from me or at least of being charged for its use, especially when I’ve already incurred Netflix and several magazine subscription costs, is, well, unbearable.
Essentially, if Comcast Corporation, the cable giant openly opposed to Hulu’s distribution of free TV content, ends up merging with NBC Universal, Hulu — of which NBC owns a substantial part, along with Fox Broadcasting and Walt Disney Co. — may no longer be free.
The argument from Comcast and others, including Wall Street investors, is that people will slowly stop subscribing to pay-TV services and watch their favorite cable shows exclusively online, effectively killing off the cable industry.
Of course, this isn’t a realistic fear, but merely another example of blaming the Internet for all earthly woes. If I were home, I would watch Glee on TV. Nobody elects to watch shows online if they don’t have to. The screen is generally smaller, the loading time inconvenient, the commercials unexciting or even disturbing (no more advertisements for female arousal gels, please), the choppiness maddening and the poor sound and image quality — compared to, say, high-definition TV — very unfortunate.
Even if time and technological advances eliminate some of these shortcomings, TV will always be one step ahead.
Plus, if cable companies were eventually bankrupted by Hulu and the like, then the shows themselves would cease to be, and we would have no need of Hulu. Clearly, Comcast is mistaken — or simply money-grubbing.
Right?
It’s easy, at first, to give bad press to the notion of pay models for websites. The Internet was originally born free, and we now take free online content as a given. If we can’t find some video online, or even the text of a popular book, we get angry. How is it, we ask, that no one has posted this online? Screw copyright; this is the Internet!
But ultimately, we can’t screw copyright. People have rights to their intellectual property, and it isn’t avarice, per se, that is animating corporate leaders to propose new pay models. If certain businesses are to survive, revenue must come in, and right now online advertisements aren’t nearly enough. Consider the newspaper, seemingly fated to fade out of existence as the Internet takes over. In all likelihood, newspapers will not completely die out, but for them to survive — and survive they must — online pay models will probably have to be implemented.
I read the New York Times every day and don’t pay a cent. A part of me thinks I should be able to, but another part of me — an increasingly larger part —  thinks I shouldn’t. We should pay for the services we use. The mistake of the Internet was that it started out free — a privilege that must eventually, if such things as newspapers and cable TV and even music are to survive and flourish, be taken away.
What of Glee, my favorite show? It isn’t the only show I watch on Hulu, actually (bring back Firefly!). Despite my initial shock at even considering paying for free access, I now believe I would be comfortable paying a small premium to use the website. Cable charges exorbitant fees anyway; if Hulu’s premium were comparable to, say, Netflix’s (maybe a little less), I would certainly consider paying it — especially if it meant an end to commercials and guaranteed high image and sound quality. I think the compromise is a good one: no commercials for your favorite shows, but a monthly charge. Think TiVo, except anywhere.
The process of monetizing the Internet will inevitably be a slow one. We must be weaned off our sense of entitlement, and that will take time.
Especially for people who thinks they’re entitled to everything.

President Barack Obama started off his presidency by distinguishing between the two wars America is currently fighting: The war in Iraq is the one that is unnecessary and the war in Afghanistan was the one of “necessity.” But what makes a war necessary? Obama argues that the Afghan war is being fought for the immediate safety and security of the United States. But is that reason enough for war?
Renowned historian and author, Howard Zinn has recently been traveling around the country and speaking out against war — he himself came to the revelation that his own service in World War II was wrong.
Zinn makes the important distinction between a “just cause” and a “just war.”
“Our culture is so war prone, that we immediately rush and make this logical jump from ‘this is a just cause’ to ‘it deserves a war,’” he said.
Indeed, a war and a cause are very different things, but what distinguishes the moral justness appropriate to each?
Zinn argues that, without exception, the means of wars have not been justified by their ends. For instance, during the Korean War from 1950–1953, an estimated 2 million Korean civilians were killed. The situation after the war was almost identical to that before the war — with a dictatorship in power in North Korea and a dictatorship in power in South Korea.
The word “civilian” is too abstract and technical, and doesn’t adequately communicate what a “civilian death” truly is. Maybe wars would be seen in a different light if, in print and on TV, the word “civilian” were replaced with “completely innocent person minding his own business, who likely had a spouse and children, and a mother and a father, all of whom he loved and who loved him dearly.”
There are many parallels between these other unjustified wars and the current war in Afghanistan. Estimates of total civilian deaths from the war — including direct deaths from bombs and guns and indirect deaths from lack of access to hospitals and food — range in the tens of thousands.
Many experts have claimed that the terrorist groups that the war in Afghanistan was supposed to defeat have in fact become even stronger as a result of the war. In a 2005 paper, the Oxford Research Group stated that “Al-Qaida and its affiliates remain active and effective, with a stronger support base and a higher intensity of attacks than before 9/11.” Claims like these cast serious doubt on the justness and necessity of the war in Afghanistan.
How do countries get tangled up in all of these wars and death? Zinn frequently cites psychologist Gustave Gilbert, who interviewed extensively high-ranking Nazi officials before, during and after their trials. In talking to Hermann Göring, the second ranking official under Adolf Hitler, Gilbert recorded Göring as saying, “Naturally, the common people don’t want war … But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along … That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.”
This is obviously not the evidence for the case to cease all wars, but it does aptly describe how war is initiated.
Zinn is often presented with the notion that war is part of human nature. If this were true, however, why do governments bend over backwards in their efforts to persuade the populations to go to war? Wouldn’t hoards of people just spontaneously jump up, guns in hand and ready to fight, at the mere mention of bloody battle?
Rather, the American government has to spend months and years and billions of dollars persuading its people to consent and pick up arms. The current public opinion doesn’t seem to be very strong for continued operations in Afghanistan: a recent New York Times/CBS poll found that half of Americans are disaffected by the war and the majority want all troops back within two years.
Hopefully, Obama will soon come to see the Afghan war — not just the Iraq war — as one of wasted resources and life instead of continuing to believe in its necessity.
Obama has a lot riding on the war in Afghanistan, from the thousands of jobs it generates to the keeping of his own word. But if he thinks it over and decides to pull American forces out as soon as possible, it would be the bravest decision any president has made in a long time.
Max Hoiland is a senior majoring in cinema-television critical studies.
Jennifer,
What the fuck are you talking about?
War is bad, peace is good, yadda yadda yadda….
This is a message to Mr. Max Hoiland, the senior majoring in cinema-television critical studies who, thanks to a war, lives in a country that secures his freedom of political speech:
As a young student at USC, you should be forgiven for your naivete about world events, international relations and the difficult decisions that plague our leaders as they attempt to secure our nation.  But, from s a USC alum who has served in Iraq and is preparing to deploy to Afghanistan at the end of this month, your opinion is uninformed and your arguments against the war in Afghanistan are careless.
I am curious:  according to your logic, how should we have responded to the thousands of deaths we suffered on 9/11?  What is the world’s responsibility when a tyrant is committing genocide, as Saddam Hussein did when he massacred the Kurds?  Should we neglect the abhorrent abuses of millions of women by the Taliban and allow them to continue to harbor the terrorists who are plotting to kill US civilians, people you suggest we refer to as “completely innocent person minding his own business, who likely had a spouse and children, and a mother and a father, all of whom he loved and who loved him dearly.”  And, according to this same logic, are you suggesting we should have looked the other way when Hitler was murdering millions of Jews?
I hate to break it to you but Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are imaginary.  And so is the world you live in if you think pulling American forces from Afghanistan would be a prudent choice.  The terrorists who hide behind Islam to justify their jihad against America will continue to recruit and train more followers, followers who will continue to plot attacks against America and our sympathizers.  And they will be able to do so freely in the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan because currently the people of that country are too vulnerable and the security forces are unprepared to stop this activity within their borders.
The casualties of war are terrible…but this is considered a “just” war because the potential casualties if we were to withdraw are far greater.  It is an unfortunate truth but a likely truth nonetheless.  And, might I suggest, that you should abandon the theory of the delusional (and the Nazi you quoted) for the truth and reality of the world we live in today.

An hour before the lecture was scheduled to start Tuesday, students and faculty were already lined up in front of Bovard Auditorium, pushing to get a good seat. When the doors finally opened, they filed in and waited to hear Jane Goodall speak about her work.
An internationally recognized primatologist, ethologist and anthropologist, Goodall has won several awards including the Medal of Tanzania, the Hubbard Medal and the Gandhi-King Award. She came to USC to give a lecture on her studies of chimps overseas, her investigation of how the environment affects animals and humans and the impact individuals can have.

A key point, Goodall said, is that humans need to think every day about their effects on the environment.
“Humans are not as different as we used to think from the rest of the animal kingdom,” Goodall said. “The only difference is that we have a sophisticated language … so it’s led to the explosive development of the human intellect. Therefore, how come the most intellectual species that has ever walked the planet is destroying it? Is there a disconnect between the clever head and the human heart?”
Goodall has been an adjunct professor at USC for 19 years, giving a lecture every three years to update USC on her work and to push students to take an active role in positively impacting the environment.
“I’m really inspired by Jane Goodall as a pioneer in anthropology, but also as a great activist for change, academia, change in our world consciousness, evolution, how we fit into this world and the respect we need to bring to animals and other forms of life,” said Antonia Blumberg, a sophomore majoring in anthropology who attended the speech.
Goodall was also instrumental in founding the Jane Goodall Research Center at USC. The center sends USC graduate students to conduct research on the behavior of wild apes and other primates, and also stores data from the Gombe Research Center, according to Craig Stanford, co-director of the center.
With the founding of the research center in 1991, Goodall agreed to give regular speeches on campus, which is what brought her to Bovard Tuesday.
Goodall began her lecture by imitating a greeting that chimpanzees would normally give in Gombe, eliciting a round of applause from the audience. She continued by updating the audience on the work done in Gombe and reflected on her dream to study animals in Africa.
“I was the wrong sex. I was a mere girl, and girls didn’t do that sort of thing … I never heard from my family, a single word suggesting that I might not be able to achieve my dream,” Goodall said to the audience. “My mother would always say to me and my sister that if you really want something and you work hard and you take advantage of opportunity and you never give up, you will find a way.”
Both the students and faculty in attendance said they enjoyed Goodall’s lecture and praised both her delivery and her content. At the end of her speech, the audience gave her a standing ovation.
“It was really inspiring because at times it feels like there’s no way, that it’s impossible to fix what we’ve messed with, but after listening to her, each of us can make a difference and if each of us makes an effort, [then] we’ll have a huge impact on everyone,” said Brittany Davis, a freshman majoring in broadcast journalism. “She was so well-spoken, and everything was ordered in the way she wanted to say it to us … This woman has lived such an amazing and inspirational life.”
Blumberg agreed.
“I feel like I was being changed, just by listening to her and meeting her,” she said. “Her talk was one of the most important things that people our age can be hearing.”
Stanford said he was pleased with the outcome and thought Goodall’s lecture made an impact on the audience.
“The audience was 100 percent receptive to her message. They wanted inspiration and they got it,” Stanford said.

If you come from a place where seeing someone that looks a little like Jon Lovitz is considered a celebrity spotting, then Los Angeles is supposed to be an exciting change of pace. Stars are everywhere! Not actual stars– those are obscured by the thick smog. But celebrities! Tara Reid, Ryan Seacrest, that guy from that show! If you get out at all, aren’t you supposed to see them?
It’s harder than it looks.
But it turns out that sometimes, you don’t even have to leave campus to see some stars.
Last Monday (as in September 28, not yesterday), Ludacris was spotted in New/North, which made him the second coolest rap artist on campus at that time— Lil’ Romeo still goes here, yo! Apparently, Ludacris was visiting a friend of the family.
And last night, Arnold Schwartzenegger was at the Starbucks on Hoover having coffee with his daughter, who is a student here. He’s probably feeling pretty good that his daughter isn’t attending school across town.
Not a bad week. At the least, this is way better than when people saw Heidi and Spencer walking around VKC last year. The  two of them collectively brought down the average intelligence of the campus so significantly, the University dropped behind Chico State in the U.S. News & World Report rankings.
Oh, and the Sprinkles Truck was on Trousdale today, which mean everyone in THH was  just a few degrees away from Oprah.
My freshman year I walked by Salma Hayek in front of Marks Hall. No lie.
Can’t believe I missed the Sprinkles Truck… I didn’t even know it existed!

Two USC players received weekly honors for their performances in Saturday’s 30-3 blowout win of No. 24 Cal.
Senior safety Taylor Mays and redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams each were named Pac-10 Players of the Week — Mays for his defensive work and Williams for his contributions on special teams.
Mays recorded 10 tackles — six of them solo — and caught a key interception against the Golden Bears. Mays’ interception of quarterback Kevin Riley came in the end zone on the Bears’ first drive, killing Cal’s momentum and opening the floodgates for a dominating USC win.
Mays was also named the Lott Trophy IMPACT Player of the Week.
Williams received recognition for his 66-yard punt return that sparked the Trojans in the first half. Williams also caught eight passes for 108 yards and remains USC’s leading pass-catcher this year.

The USC men’s water polo team has played twelve games this season, eleven of them away from the friendly confines of McDonald’s Swim Stadium. But after a victory over Pacific on Sunday upped their road record to 10-1, the road is starting to look like home for the Trojans.
The No. 3 Trojans (12-1, 3-0) had claimed a 35-7 all-time record against the Tigers prior to their match up in Stockton, Calif., and continued their success with a 10-7 victory, but the three-goal margin of victory was far less than in years past. During their 2008 campaign, the Trojans averaged a seven-goal margin of victory during their two regular season wins over Pacific, but this year’s first meeting between the two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation foes proved much closer.
Daily Trojan | Katelynn Whitaker
The Trojans got to the Pacific defense early in the first quarter, when just 22 seconds in senior two-meter Shea Buckner converted on a penalty shot to put the Trojans up 1-0.
After a defensive opening quarter saw the Trojans up 2-1, the Trojans turned to their offense to provide the statement in the second quarter, scoring three unanswered goals to open the period. Sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka, and senior two-meters J.W. Krumpholz and Jordan Thompson all scored to give the Trojans a 5-2 lead heading to halftime.
The third quarter opened much like the second, as the Trojans scored two easy unanswered goals and coasted from there.
The Trojans may have taken their foot off the gas a little too much, as the Tigers creeped to within three, but a goal from senior driver Justin Rappel rendered a last minute goal from Tiger senior Joey Rossi unimportant as the Trojans escaped with the 10-7 victory.
The Trojan’s close victory over Pacific completed a weekend of close victories, which had begun with an airtight 8-6 victory over No. 4 California, as part of the Weekender series, held prior to the football game in front of a packed Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley.
Playing in their first MPSF contest of the season, the Golden Bears were looking to avenge an early season loss to the Trojans at the NorCal Tournament, where the teams had played in the consolation championship game, and the Trojans had walked away with an 8-6 victory and third place in the tournament.
The opening quarter went by slowly, as both teams attempted and failed to convert on 6-5 advantages. Near the end of the first quarter, the Trojans were able to break the scoreless tie on a lob shot by senior driver Matt Sagehorn.
Less than two minutes into the second period, Thompson added a goal of his own to put the Trojans up 2-0.
The Trojan defense, led by sophomore goalie Joel Dennerly (11 saves), held against a strong California attack, but was broken late in the second quarter by Cal junior Brian Dudley. The Golden Bear’s first goal of the game would prove to be the only score its offense could muster until two minutes remained in the third quarter.
In between Dudley’s score and Cal sophomore Luka Saponjic’s goal with 2:06 left in the third period, Rappel and redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling each netted two goals apiece to put the Trojans up 6-1, a score from which the Trojans coasted to victory.
Kurzeka and Krumpholz added two fourth quarter goals, while the Trojan defense stuttered a bit, giving up three goals to a motivated California attack, but still ended the game with a 8-6 victory, the same score by which the Trojans had beat the Golden Bears at the NorCal Tournament.
The Trojans can now look forward to Friday, when No. 19 Princeton (7-5) comes to McDonald’s, as the Trojans will finally get a chance to rest their road warrior mentality and play for the home crowd.

LAPD is currently investigating the potential armed robbery of a student on campus Thursday night.
The victim, a female, was walking alone down McClintock Ave. by Cromwell Field at 11:30 p.m. Thursday when she was approached by a robber who placed what the victim described as a “hard metal object” against her neck.  DPS Captain David Carlisle said the student complied and handed over her purse. According to the DPS report, the robber fled in a blue sedan.
Authorities only know the robber was wearing a dark, long-sleeve shirt. There is no description of the driver of the sedan.
“A robbery on campus is a very rare occurrence,” Carlisle said.  “Having this crime occur disturbs us and we’re taking the precautions we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
After the incident, DPS immediately redeployed some of their off campuses resources on campus.
LAPD’s investigation of the incident is still ongoing. Carlisle said LAPD is following a lead but DPS has no further information at this time.

USC student Chris Roessner drove to the US Department of Veteran Affairs’ Westwood office Friday morning to apply for an emergency payment for student veterans. The line was so long, he said, he applied for the payment from his iPhone instead, as he needed the money so he could pay his rent.
Roessner, a first year graduate student in the USC Student of Cinematic Arts’ Peter Stark Producing Program, was one of nearly 25,000 student veterans nationwide to line up for emergency payments worth $3,000 last week. Roessner and the other veterans — there are about 100 others at USC — rely on the Post-9/11 GI Bill to help fund their education, but Veterans Affairs has fallen behind in processing applications for the funds veterans need to keep up with their payments.
Vetting funds · Chris Roessner, a graduate student, served in Iraq and is now waiting for GI Bill benefits to help fund his education. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan
The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides fee or tuition coverage for every veteran who served after Sept. 11, 2001, up to the cost of the most expensive public school in the state where the veteran will be studying.
USC adopted the program at the last minute after controversy over California’s tuition rates. Originally, California veterans were only entitled to benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program — a special provision of the bill — as California tuition was listed at 0. Now, however, the Veteran Affairs’ website lists California’s GI Bill tuition benefits as $287 per credit hour and $2,165.25 in fees per semester.
Veteran Affairs, however, has been slow in processing applications for GI Bill benefits, and veterans have been forced to wait for their funds, as expenses pile up.
To remedy the problem, Veterans Affairs began issuing the emergency checks — handwritten checks that advance some of the GI Bill money to veterans — on Friday.
The emergency funds give veterans $3,000 they can use immediately. Those funds will eventually be taken out of the veterans’ GI Bill benefits.
“The $3,000 advanced pay is going to be recouped in small increments from [my] future GI Bill payments,” Roessner said.
Roessner has been using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for rent expenses, but since his checks for this year have not arrived, he will use the emergency funds for rent.
Roessner is not the only USC veteran having trouble with GI Bill benefits.
Anthony Tagum, a Marine and a senior majoring in accounting, said he is applying for the $3,000 emergency payment because his funds haven’t been processed yet.
“[The GI Bill] is going to help me cover all my books and school supplies and helps me cover housing and any tuition payments,” Tagum said.
Roessner, who served in the Army for six years before college, also earned his undergraduate degree at USC, though without any Veterans Affairs’ benefits. Roessner decided he wanted an education during the time he served in Iraq.
“I learned how important education was in Iraq when I saw how dangerous Saddam Hussein thought education was,” Roessner said. “I decided that the only thing that was important to me if I was to make it back from Iraq was that I would cultivate my own unique perspective on the world. And that was more precious than anything.”
In addition to GI Bill benefits, veterans at USC could benefit from the Yellow Ribbon program. The YRP allows universities to volunteer to give veterans additional funds that Veteran Affairs will match, Robert Morley, USC associate registrar and tuition exchange liaison wrote in an email.
USC’s participation in the YRP includes 20 awards for undergraduates at $2,500 each, and awards of $10,000 for 10 students in the School of Social Work and 10 graduates in the Rossier School of Education. Those awards are matched by Veterans Affairs.
Morley said the Veterans Affairs requires that veterans are awarded with YRP stipends on a first-come first-served basis.
“Whoever provided us with their VA certification for benefits [first], that’s how we determined who would get [the stipend],” he wrote.

Bill Clinton endorsed San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom for California governor, as both the former president and the mayor spoke about the importance of energy efficiency and higher education to students at Los Angeles City College on Monday.
“Gavin Newsom has walked the walk. He doesn’t just talk about it,” Clinton said. “I’m glad that he plans to do it on a larger scale.”

Even before Clinton’s endorsement, Newsom had gained a strong following at USC. USC Students for Gavin Newsom held a phone bank on campus Saturday, and has been the most active group to campaign for a gubernatorial candidate at USC so far.
Clinton spoke to LACC students about the importance of using green technology to increase jobs, and how providing more affordable education could help achieve that.
“This country needs to make a big comeback,” he said. “This is not rocket science. California needs jobs and America needs jobs.”
He said he believed the state can get one million lost jobs back with new businesses that promote energy efficiency.
Newsom echoed Clinton’s advice with his campaign goals to produce green jobs and invest in alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
He also said he wanted to expand the universal health care system he helped establish in San Francisco to encompass the entire state and, eventually, the nation.
“If a city can do it, a county can certainly do it. If a county can do it, a state can do it. And make no mistake,” Newsom told students. “If a state can do it, this country can do it. The United States of America has a moral and ethical — as well as economic obligation — to make sure we deliver on this promise.”
Newsom added that the state is responsible for reconciling price increases at state colleges and universities, telling LACC students they had the opportunity to do something about the controversial issue.





“I encourage all of you to get involved and to be a part of the change — part of the new direction here in California,” he said.
Restoring California’s economy with job creation and college assistance are plans Newsom has for the state if elected next fall.
His goals are achievable on a state level, said LACC student Sarah Florez, who attended the event and also plans to transfer to USC next fall.
“Every place should be like San Francisco in going green,” she said.
Neither Clinton or Newsom made any mention of Jerry Brown, California’s attorney general who has filed initial papers for a gubernatorial run and who was involved in clashes with Clinton during the 1992 democratic primaries.
The LACC speech and public endorsement was followed by a private fundraiser, where tickets were priced up to $50,000, according to the Associated Press.

Students and local residents gathered to learn and comment on upcoming development projects in the neighborhood at a Los Angeles Department of City Planning community workshop held Saturday.
From 9 a.m. to noon, nearly 200 community members trickled through the open doors of the Galen Center’s Founders Club to weigh in on a number of proposed changes to the South and Southeast Los Angeles regions by writing comments on the enlarged maps and diagrams on display. An invitation to the event advertised both the issues of commercial revitalization and neighborhood conservation, as well as the opportunity to assist in planning the areas surrounding the Exposition Line stations currently under construction.

The event marked the first time the Founders Club had been used to house a community input workshop, which actually fulfilled an
ongoing university obligation to accommodate events serving the residents of the surrounding
neighborhood through the university’s Civic and Community Relations department.
“The Galen Center needed city approval to be constructed,” said David Galaviz, executive director of USC Local Government Relations. “And a part of the condition of the Galen Center’s construction was that it be made available for community uses.”
Most of the changes proposed at the meeting, especially those
falling under the designation of “Design Standards and Use Limitations,” were conceived in response to either resident demands or perceived local needs.
“We’re focused on the community holistically,” said Jenny Scanlin, downtown region project manager of the Community Redevelopment Agency. She described the agency’s ongoing redevelopment efforts to inquiring workshop participants. “We’re focused on bringing in new housing … Combined, we have about 265 units of affordable housing coming in.”
Other proposed changes include granting certain areas, such as Jefferson Park and Vermont Square, designations as Historic Preservation Overlay Zones. According to City of Los Angeles City Planning Associate Griselda Gonzalez, HPOZ status is typically granted to maintain a given neighborhood’s existing character and to promote consistency in architecture and design.
Considering the city’s
already-stretched finances, 2009 might not seem the ideal year to propose changes of this scope and scale. But Pete Wilson, a local architect who participated in the event, said the present climate of uncertainty is precisely suited to cultivate innovation.
“Los Angeles has to change, so being ambitious is a good idea right now,” Wilson said.
As per the Department of City Planning’s previously outlined steps toward a community plan update, input gleaned from Saturday’s workshop is to be incorporated into the first draft of the updated plan, which will again be presented to the public at an open house forum. A subsequent public hearing will allow for the submission of formal testimony — written or verbal — in response to the draft plan. Only after receiving approval from the Area Planning Commission, the City Planning Commission and the Planning and Land Use subcommittee will the modified community plan be submitted to the City Council for revision and eventual approval.
The location of the workshop — they are usually held at municipal areas such as libraries — allowed for more participation and input from the USC community.
Eric Bruins, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, took advantage of this location. Bruins, who currently works with A Place Called Home, a community center in South Los Angeles, said he was focusing his attention on bicycle issues in the city.
“We’re trying to make that potential bike lane into an actual bike lane,” Bruins said, indicating a dotted line on the map of Downtown before him. “It seems silly to devote two-thirds of the roadway to private transportation when that’s not the primary way people get around.”
Bruins said he was pleasantly surprised by his experience with the city planners staffing the workshop.
“It was really positive,” Bruins said. “They were really accessible and willing to talk with us and answer questions.”
Despite the relatively convenient location, the number of USC students at the workshop seemed minimal.
Jennifer Yee, a junior majoring in comparative literature who belongs to the student organization Campus and Community United, said the small turnout was because of the way students relate to the area.
“There’s a lot of segregation between the students and the neighborhood,” Yee said. “People are leaving after four years.”
Gonzalez’s explanation of the less-than-overwhelming USC presence echoed Yee’s.
“I think maybe USC students may not be too familiar with the issues of South Los Angeles,” Gonzalez said. “Students are just here for a
limited amount of time. I think some of them may not feel that they’re
affected by the long term issues that face South LA.”

Academy Award-winning film director Roman Polanski has had a turbulent life, and that’s not considering the last 31 years he has been living as a fugitive of California state law.
Polanski’s troubles started long before he pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 and subsequently fled the United States a year later to live in exile in France. He’s had to endure many traumatic events, including his mother’s death at the hands of the Nazis, his escape from a concentration camp and the murder of his pregnant wife Sharon Tate by the Manson Family in 1969.
Tortured artist · Filmmaker Roman Polanski has spent the last 31 years as a fugitive of California state law for the rape of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey (now Geimer) in 1977 at Jack Nicholson’s mansion. - Photo courtesy of THINKFilm
The director, whose films include Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby was finally arrested  in Zurich, Switzerland on Sept. 26   for unlawful sex with a minor — a criminal charge he admitted to years ago — while on his way to attend an award ceremony.
It appears now, after his prolonged arrest, that Polanski may indeed come face-to-face with the trouble he has been avoiding for decades; he may be extradited to Los Angeles, where he will face charges of statutory rape.
In the years since the rape took place, the victim, Samantha Geimer, reached a private settlement with the director and vocalized her wishes that all charges against Polanski be dropped.
This stipulation, as well as the time period in which the director has been living and working as a fugitive, has prompted quite a debate over exactly how Polanski’s case should be handled. As a result, the director has many supporters, but also a great deal who oppose him.
Several prominent Hollywood figures such as Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein have all aligned in protest, which includes the signing of a petition that states, “Filmmakers in France, in Europe, in the United States and around the world are dismayed by this decision.”
Hollywood is not the only outlet expressing concern and support for Polanski. Members of the French and Polish governments have also made their defense of the director quite prominent. Polanski’s colleagues and admirers have stressed the notion of his arrest as a deliberate attack on the artist that should, after more than 30 years, be put to rest.
The director’s opposition certainly does not have the overwhelming star power that his defense does, but it is making just as much noise as Polanski’s supporters.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, which issued the warrant for Polanski’s arrest, as well as many feminist groups and several Hollywood players — most of who have stayed somewhat silent in their opinions — are among many who seek justice for the crime Polanski committed years ago.
Many believe the overall debate merely concerns the treatment of Polanski now and during the last 30 years, with no regard for the crime he committed. The crime itself has been taken aside to make room for the director’s reputation and presence around the world. It is this very fact that many who oppose Polanski find utterly disturbing.
While Hollywood and other European filmmakers believe the charges to be nothing more than “a so-called crime,” according to Weinstein, many others believe the director’s possible acquittal to be a blatant disregard of moral values and established laws.
The basic concern: How far can celebrities go to avoid legal incrimination? Many see a dismissal of Polanski’s charges as a solidification of the power of celebrity.
The troubling part is that this heated debated may be difficult to put to rest. The US Department of Justice has up to 60 days to request an extradition and, if Polanski refuses, the legal proceedings could easily continue for months.
He has continued to direct films, most notably 2002’s The Pianist, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director. He did not attend the ceremony, but still received a modest-sized standing ovation.
He also has a new film in production, but its future, like Polanski’s, is also now very uncertain.
As one side asks why now, after 30 years, others express satisfaction for an arrest finally taking place. No matter what happens with his case, it is certain Polanski will, once again, not be able to avoid traumatic events.
Polanski has the right to make any and all of those arguments in his defense — in court! Skipping the country on the eve of sentencing, because you think you might not like the sentence, is not a legitimate defense. By the way, did anyone mention the part about Polanski drugging, raping, and sodomizing a 13-year-old? Why would you even want to make excuses for him?
Mr. Clark,
Polanski served the time ordered per his plea bargain. When he caught wind that the media-motivated judge was going to sentence him to longer time, e fled.
Also, Mr. Clark, the victim has stated she feels it’s time to move on and she does not desire to press charges.
Wow, Poor Roman has sure had a tragic life. Let’s all feel sorry for him!
I see that you’re trying to give the impression of covering both sides of the story, but your bias (or the bias of your information sources) is clear. Nowhere in the article do you mention the incident that absolutely crucial to understanding this controversy: in 1977, Roman Polanski drugged, forcibly raped, and sodomized a 13-year-old girl against her vocal protestations. Let me state that again. In 1977, Roman Polanski drugged, forcibly raped, and sodomized a 13-year-old girl against her vocal protestations.
This is not a case of a handful of prudes staging a 30-year witch hunt against a misunderstood Frenchman with a misunderstood love affair. It’s a case of a monster getting away with rape, being glorified by his peers for it, and being inexplicably defended by the European and American left for over 30 years.

Hot Topic shoppers, rejoice: After a three year hiatus, AFI has returned to provide skinny jean and tight T-shirt-wearing, morbid jewelry adorned, pre-pubescent teens with some new tunes to accompany their shopping experience for the next few weeks. Crash Love, the goth emo rock band’s eighth studio album, has recently hit stores in both a regular and deluxe edition.
Perhaps many readers may be rolling their eyes at the thought of yet another addition to the insufferably lengthy list of recent emo rock albums. Before you start to complain, at least give AFI their due respect. These chaps from Northern California have been around for quite some time. Forming in 1991, AFI released its first studio album, Answer That and Stay Fashionable, four years later and has continued to churn out new music ever since. If we were to pull out our handy music industry calculators, we’d discover that 18 years of success roughly equates to a ridiculously large and impressive number in emo rock years. The band’s uncanny staying power demands that we consider them with a bit more respect than its more recently formed contemporaries, such as My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Alien Ant Farm and Panic at the Disco, who have finally rid themselves of that bizarrely placed exclamation point.

Crash Love demonstrates precisely how AFI has managed to experience continued success in the music industry while maintaining a fiercely loyal fan base. The new album is oozing with harmlessly gothic rock anthems, complete with infectious guitar riffs and pulsating beats. Images of young lovers and teenage rebellion constitute the lyrics of lead singer Davey Havok and easily attract the middle school-aged goth punk demographic. Song titles like “Darling, I Want to Destroy You” and “Medicate” might make Mommy and Daddy wary of what their impressionable kids are listening to. However, the straight edge lifestyle of both Havok and guitarist Jade Puget allow them to give AFI the thumbs-up over its other contemporaries.
“Torch Song” opens the album with a bang — or more specifically, a boisterous “Oh!” from the nasally voiced singer. In fact, Havok decides to open not one, not two, but five songs with that same earsplitting exclamation. The mostly playful atmosphere of Crash Love’s music speaks for itself. We do not need Havok’s yelps constantly reminding us that he is having fun and that we should also join in.
Puget’s guitar effortlessly matches Havok’s passion as his voice yearns, I’d tear out my eyes for you, my dear, to see everything you do. The lyric is certainly not the most brilliant string of words to ever grace the human ear; yet, it has all the ingredients to melt the young hearts of its target audience. So will songs like “Beautiful Thieves,” which tells the tale of a Bonnie and Clyde-esque couple running from its inevitable faith, and “Veronica Sawyer Smokes,” about love at first cigarette light.
In the same manner of the band’s previous outing, Decemberunderground, most of the songs seem to have been created for the sole purpose of being performed with fake plastic guitars in the next edition of Rock Band or Guitar Hero. “Medicate,” the CD’s first single, will undoubtedly amass the same popularity as the band’s incredibly similar-sounding 2006 hit “Miss Murder.”
The deluxe edition of Crash Love is a must have for devoted AFI fans, but for the rest of us, downloading “Medicate,” “Torch Song,” “End Transmission” and “Fainting Spells” will provide a sufficient musical platter of the CD’s highlights. For those who would rather jab a chopstick through their ears than listen to emo rock, it is strongly advised that you keep your distance from Hot Topic while you peruse the mall during the next few weeks.
