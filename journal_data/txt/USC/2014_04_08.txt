The event was organized by USC Professor Philip Ethington, the faculty master of New Residential College. After dinner, Price spoke about his experiences in public service and his agenda for the 9th district before taking questions from students.
“You don’t get into politics to get rich,” Price said. “You have to be in it for the right reasons, and genuinely care about the community.”
Born and raised in Los Angeles, Price graduated from Morningside High School in Inglewood, Calif. where he served as the student body president and said he was encouraged by his parents to be engaged and involved as a student. He spent a year at San Francisco State University — a hotbed for political activism in the late 1960s — before attending junior college and eventually transferring to Stanford University where he earned his bachelor’s degree. From there, Price went on to Santa Clara University where he earned a law degree.
The city council member said he was always attracted to politics and community engagement and had planned to join the Carter administration through its office of international trade. After Carter lost the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan, however, those ambitions were cut short. Nevertheless, Price still moved to the capitol and spent several years working in the telecommunications industry during a period of rapid growth of satellite technology.
Eventually, he moved back to Los Angeles and began his political career after defeating an incumbent council member in his home city of Inglewood, Calif. and worked his way up to the State Senate when he was encouraged to run for the seat in the 9th district. Since assuming office in July 2013, Price said his focus has been on the economic revitalization of the district and the restoration of civil services.
“We had people who couldn’t go out in their backyard because trash was piled so high in the alleyway,” Price said. “How can you live like that?”
He noted that as part of the “Clean and Green” initiative, over 1000 tons of debris have been removed from around the district, the equivalent of 20 garbage trucks.
“We want to encourage people to rely on civic services, and ensure that those services are being delivered,” he said.
He also spoke about his efforts to attract new businesses to the district, including a new shopping center at Central Avenue and Slauson Avenue, the first new center in 50 years. In addition, he said he has been working to revitalize parts of the district, such as Central Avenue, that have historical and cultural significance for jazz in particular.
“The district is open for business, but not business as usual,” Price said.
The 9th district encompasses a large portion of South Los Angeles, including LA Live and USC. Price said it was important for the university, the largest private employer in the area, to take an active role in improving the community.
He said that USC is a “tremendous economic engine” and can be a resource for the community at large, urging the university to do the same work it does in the surrounding area “across the freeway.”
“I’m not too worried about USC and LA Live, they can take care of themselves,” Price said. “I’m worried about the people on 48th and Broadway.”
Students in attendance enjoyed the candid nature of the discussion.
“I really liked how intimate it was,” said Sam Deutsch, a freshman majoring in political economy. “You could feel that he really cares about the community, which is nice to hear from a politician.”
Andrew Morris, a freshman majoring in cognitive science and mathematics, enjoyed how he touched on the surrounding community.
“I was glad that he spoke about the hopelessness that people in the district have felt,” Morris said. “As USC students, we aren’t really faced with that unless we cross the street.”

Piper Kerman, author of Orange is the New Black: My Year in a Woman’s Prison spoke with audience members at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom Tuesday night about her experiences behind bars and the state of the modern corrections system.
Inmate to writer · Author Piper Kerman revealed to students her goal to enlighten readers about incarceration and prison life with her book. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
 
Kerman’s book describes her time at Danbury Correctional Facility in Connecticut for felonies involving drug trafficking that she had committed about 10 years earlier. After college, Kerman followed an older woman through various areas around the world, including places such as Bali and Zurich. She was asked to carry drug money from Chicago to Brussels, which led to her imprisonment.
Her memoir was adapted into a Netflix original series created by Jenji Kohan that was recently renewed for a second season. For those reading the book, Kerman hopes the reader gets a true idea of incarceration.
“I hoped that the reader might come away with a different idea of who is in prison in this country, why they are there and what really happens to them behind the jail walls,” Kerman said.
She noted that over the past 40 years, there has been an 800 percent increase in women’s incarceration because the justice system in the United States is putting people in prison that would not have been put in prison in the past.
When she was incarcerated, prisoners were put to work in various areas of the prison, and Kerman was placed in electrical work as well as construction. Kerman also mentioned that working and doing things that allow women to express their creativity in prison help them get through their sentences.
“You want control over your body in a place that tries to take that control away,” Kerman said.
The author also talked about how race, class and gender play a role within the prison system.
“Prisons are designed to marginalize people,” Kerman said. “Many of the guards are males, and there can sometimes be problems between the correctional officers and the prisoners.”
Kerman said she hopes people will soon be able to view prisoners through more than just a negative light.
“My only hope is that everyone in the criminal justice system can be judged not only on their worst days, but also on their best days,” Kerman said.
Students in attendance considered Kerman’s discussion especially telling about today’s incarceration system.
“I think it was really eye-opening and pretty inspiring, and it made me want to get involved in something similar in the future,” said Aileen Li, a freshman majoring in neuroscience and psychology.
Mimi Gualtieri, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, said she was surprised about how nicely prisoners treated Kerman.
“I think she did a really good job of pointing out problems regarding the prison system, and had I been in her situation, I don’t think I would have expected people to be as nice as she described them to be,” she said.
Kerman mentioned how kind the prisoners were to her, especially on her first day, and the prisoners offered her toothpaste and other amenities, which she had not expected.
Ben Hannani, a freshman majoring in political science, said Kerman’s talk broke down some of his preconceived notions of the prison system.
“I was interested to learn about prison reform and the role of women in prison, and she brought to light things that I would have otherwise not have been interested in,” Hannani said. “I have a really violent and aggressive vision of prisons, and after hearing Piper speak today, I realized that not all prisons are like that.”

The Marshall School of Business will establish the William   J. McMorrow Global Real Estate Program thanks to a gift from McMorrow, CEO of the real estate investment and services firm Kennedy Wilson.
The program will support cutting-edge scholarships and prepare students for leadership in an interconnected global marketplace, according to the USC press release.
“We are profoundly grateful that someone with William McMorrow’s stature and expertise in real estate has chosen to put his name on this endeavor,” said USC Senior Vice President for University Advancement Al Checcio in the press release. “We are thrilled to call Bill a partner and a friend, and we know his involvement augurs a world-class program.”
McMorrow purchased Kennedy Wilson in 1998, and since 2010, the firm has been one of the most active global investors in real estate with approximately 12 billion dollars of purchases, according to the press release.
McMorrow, a USC alumnus, received his Bachelor of Science in business administration and his MBA from Marshall as well. He has stayed involved in the USC community through serving on the executive board of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, which advances real estate knowledge and addresses issues that affect the industry.
“The William J. McMorrow Global Real Estate Program will be a vital forum for thought leadership that attracts prominent faculty and trains the next generation of visionaries in the field,” said Dean of Marshall School of Business James G. Ellis in a press release. “The gift is a natural fit for a university so rooted in Southern California, which has always been a hub of real estate innovation.”
McMorrow’s gift is part of the Campaign for the University of Southern California — an effort to secure 6 billion dollars or more in private support from individual donors, foundations and corporations.

On Tuesday evening, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted “Patriot or Traitor? Whistleblowing and Journalism in the Age of Government Surveillance,” an event featuring well-known government whistleblower, Daniel Ellsberg, who released the Pentagon Papers during the Nixon administration.
Patriot or traitor? · The panel consisted of three previous whistleblowers who spoke on the diminishment of the First Amendment and the need for proper governmental accountability. – Noel Berry | Daily Trojan
Robert Scheer, a professor and founder of Truthdig,  moderated the panel, which, along with Ellsberg, also included two other prominent whistleblowers: Thomas Drake, former senior executive of the National Security Agency, and attorney Jesselyn Radack, who currently represents Edward Snowden.
The event, a collaboration between the Annenberg School and the Government Accountability Project, is part of a two-day forum featuring the importance of government whistleblowing and the crucial duty of the press to release important truths to U.S. society.
“You don’t wake up one morning and decide to be a whistleblower,” Drake said. “I don’t remember going to my high school counselor and saying, ‘Hey, I want to be a whistleblower.’”
Radack noted that a “leak” differs from whistleblowing in that it often serves no purpose for the greater good.
“Whistleblowing, on the other hand, is done to serve the public interest and the public’s right to know,” she said.
Moreover, when the pillars of the government begin to fail, the press becomes of the utmost importance to keep the government reliable. People who factually expose the government as incompetent, however, can suffer serious consequences.
“God forbid you should disclose government illegality — because then the hammer will really fall on you, and you will face prison the rest of your life,” Radack said.
Drake, who was the second American to be charged under the Espionage Act since Ellsberg, was publicly indicted and faced 35 years in prison for whistleblowing.
“[The government] wanted to make me the example,” Drake said.
Since 9/11, Drake said, the government has disengaged itself from the Constitution, granting itself authority to use emergency powers.
“And we have been operating in that mode ever since,” he said.
Nevertheless, all three panelists expressed the opinion that whistleblowing is important to defending the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment.
Ellsberg, who claimed that the government failed to carry out its oath as stated in the Constitution, said he and his colleagues were beyond the Constitution and instead worked for the president. Ellsberg believes that he, as well as dozens of other people, had access to the papers that could have sealed a lid on the Vietnam War.
“Despite life or death situations, most of those people have stayed quiet,” Ellsberg said. “Practically everyone who had that documentation should have realized that the Constitution was being violated.”
Ellsberg stressed the cost for the United States could be steep, and when those secrets are kept and whistleblowers do not question the government.
“The price of a government keeping secrets is wars like Vietnam and wars like Iraq,” Ellsberg said.
Scheer echoed Ellsberg’s sentiments.
“Where [were] all of the people who knew that people were dying in wars that made no sense? Where are the several thousand that knew their neighbors and children who were being spied on?” Scheer asked.
Those potential whistleblowers do not release information, because if they do, they are often labeled as traitors and lack the proper protection for whistleblowers that should be enacted, Radack said.
Even so, despite now being considered a hero following the release of the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg was quickly labeled a traitor, Scheer said.
Ellsberg, who said he identifies with Snowden’s current struggle, still remembers the first time he was called a traitor in 1971.
“Chelsea Manning and now, Snowden, are no more of a traitor than I am,” he said. “And I’m not [a traitor].”
Radack, the former ethics advisor for the U.S. Department of Justice, was accused of “leaking” information when she drew attention to the illegal treatment of John Walker Lindh, who was captured as an enemy combatant by Afghan Northern Alliance forces during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.
After a photo of Lindh exposed the prisoner naked, blindfolded and gagged, the Attorney General publicly claimed that they did not know the prisoner had a legal counselor, Radack said. Emails between Radack and the FBI, exposing U.S. intelligence illegality, disappeared from Radack’s office and she was put on the no-fly list.
“I didn’t realize by going to the press I was releasing the full force of the executive branch,” Radack said.
Since this incident, Radack has defended Drake and many other     anti-government whistleblowers.
“I decided to dedicate the rest of my life to recognizing whistleblowers,” she said.
She added that the country is at a point where the First Amendment is currently “under attack.”
Drake agreed, noting issues of the government keeping secrets have increased to illegal data recovery without the consent of American citizens. He mentioned that since 9/11, the NSA has been using its extraordinary power to spy on Americans.
“The First Amendment, which I ultimately had to confront after 9/11, is the cornerstone of who we are as Americans,” he said. “If we don’t have the First Amendment, everything disappears.”
Also discussed was the importance of the press in keeping the government reliable.
“If you don’t have press, everything else becomes propaganda,” Drake said.
Geoffrey Cowan, former dean of Annenberg, said that the United States is not going to be protected by our leaders alone.
“[The leaders] have to feel the pressure from our citizens,” he said. “There couldn’t be journalism without sources. Whistleblowers, in a certain way, are sources with steroids.”
And in the time of the Vietnam War, the journalists failed at searching and clawing for the truth, the panelists said.
“Journalists were behaving as government lapdogs rather than government watchdogs,” Ellsberg said of journalism in the time of the Vietnam War. “To this day, we don’t have nearly as many whistleblowers as we could and should have.”
Students in attendance noted the panel was extremely telling on issues that are often not covered heavily.
Jamie Moskowitz, a senior majoring in communication, said she was inspired by the passion of the three speakers and how they took action to work toward justice.
“It was an honor just to hear their story,” Moskowitz said.
Sanam Ghaneeian, a sophomore majoring in communication, said the panel was helpful because she had no idea how much whistleblowers risked when presenting information to the U.S. public.
“I can’t believe how dangerous [whistleblowing] is and how much courage these people had to disclose information,” Ghaneeian said.

Chef Roy Choi, of Kogi BBQ food truck fame, has made a career out of going against the grain. A self- proclaimed culture-clasher, Choi has taken his unique Korean-American cuisine to the streets and painted a vibrant picture of Los Angeles through his eyes. Choi’s latest project, POT, is actually three individual concepts based out of The Line Hotel in Koreatown, just a few miles north of USC’s University Park campus.
You, me and kimchi · POT Bar, Café and Restaurant, created by Chef Roy Choi, is one of the newest additions to Koreatown. All three parts of the project have a diverse menu with signature items and an attentive staff. The restaurant is also perfect for kimchi lovers. – Chase Kroesche | Daily Trojan
 
POT Bar features signature cocktails and an open atmosphere. One can relax with unique drinks such as the “Uni,” which is composed of reposado tequila, uni purée, toasted nori, sesame seeds, cumin and smoked applewood salt.
Just next door, POT Café is an Asian-American take on the traditional espresso bar, featuring pastries and other dishes designed by both Choi and chef Marian Mar, a veteran of the renowned Momofuku Milk Bar in New York City. The tiny, wall-mounted café serves everything from mac and cheese pizza to black sesame mochi. Especially notable is the Ritz candy bar, a chocolatey, toffee-esque treat made from a base of buttery Ritz crackers.
Leading the charge at The Line is Choi’s flagship restaurant, POT, which serves family-style Korean hot pot dishes, and the massive cauldrons of magma-hot stew sit bubbling upon large induction burners in the center of most of the tables. College students will appreciate the “Boot Knocker,” which includes tofu, instant ramen and canned meats. More adventurous types, however, will probably go for the “Inside Story,” a delightfully rich combination of wild sesame, tripe, blood, intestines, pork broth and herbs. Needless to say, it’s a dish that serves as a reminder of exactly where the food comes from. Much like how Choi’s Kogi trucks bring quality food in a low-cost package, many of the dishes at POT elevate unappreciated or underused ingredients and give them a starring role.
Spicy, salty, sweet and just a little bit wrong, the complex flavors of Korean food invigorate the senses and rouse the tastebuds from the mundane slumber of everyday American eats. After tasting gochujang, a fermented chili paste, it’s difficult to go back to regular ketchup and mustard.
If one comes in a group, it is essentially expected that the table orders at least one hot pot to share, but POT has a variety of other dishes to offer. On the opposite side of the menu, guests can sample various types of kimchi, dumplings, soy-marinated blue crab and BBQ galbi. Diners can supplement their servings of “Inside Story” with spicy napa kimchi, refreshingly cold somen noodles, and one of the lusciously oily salt-brined mackerel. Fighting over who gets to eat the fish head is highly encouraged.
Service at POT is wonderfully attentive, if not a bit over-eager. The restaurant almost seemed over-staffed, and cups of cold buckwheat tea, served instead of water, are constantly full. Chefs behind the bar consistently ask diners how they are enjoying their meals, and waiters are constantly supplying guests with fresh bowls of rice and a never-ending supply of banchan. Sometimes it’s good to feel pampered.
POT is uncompromisingly different in all of the right ways, so if you don’t like kimchi, stay away. If you’re looking for a fun and, occasionally, challenging meal however, make sure to grab some friends and check it out immediately. For those interested in learning about Chef Roy Choi, his food and his viewpoint, he’s being interviewed by Jonathan Gold, renowned food critic, this Saturday at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.
 
POT is located at The Line Hotel. It is open from 11 AM – 11 PM daily at 3515 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90010.

Fans of Game of Thrones have been promised that this season will be the bloodiest, most action-packed yet, which has viewers guessing which main characters will be killed off over the next 10 episodes. We didn’t receive any big shocks in Season 4’s long-anticipated premiere — though we did see a fair amount of blood, thanks to Arya and the Hound, the best reluctant “buddy-cop” team this side of True Detective — but we all know they’re coming.
A couple of Thrones fans I know weren’t huge fans of this episode, due to its somewhat slow, chatter-filled pace, but I thought it was quite brilliant — and necessary. We got to see the full assimilation of Jaime back into the Lannister clan, which revealed just how much the former best swordsman in Westeros changed while he was taken hostage, and how disjointed the entire family is now: Tywin has alienated all of his children, Cersei and Tyrion still hate each other, everyone hates Joffrey (duh) and it seems as though Cersei and Jaime’s incestuous relationship is firmly in the past. The strongest bond seems to exist between brothers Jaime and Tyrion — but don’t mistake these two for the MacManus brothers from The Boondock Saints. Jaime, now sporting just one hand, can no longer bloodily avenge any wrongs done to them, and Tyrion is a dwarf who almost got killed immediately the last time he tried to engage in battle. So it seems there’s no one in the Lannister family that both can and want to physically protect one another, if it ever comes to that. Their bond has never been weaker, and even though they currently possess all positions of power in King’s Landing, they have oddly never been as collectively vulnerable.
And we were introduced to two fascinating characters in Oberyn Martell and his paramour, Ellaria Sand, who seem poised to take advantage of that by delivering chaos straight to the Lannister family doorstep — something that the royal family has had coming, and that audiences have been craving. Martell (portrayed excellently by Pedro Pascal) oozed such cunning that I’m not questioning if he’ll kill a royal Lannister, but which one will be the target of his revenge.
Tywin, however, seems somewhat unconcerned, telling Jaime, “The king is safe.” But of course, as Jamie retorts, “The king is never safe.” That exchange prompts me to think one of two things.
First, perhaps Tywin really does believe what he’s saying. After all, he thinks Stannis’ army is soundly defeated and that all the Stark children are either dead or married to a Lannister. Maybe he already has a counterattack planned to push back the efforts of Martell, as it seems strange that he would underestimate such a seemingly potent guest to his grandson’s wedding — an event he already knows is no sanctuary from violence.
The second possibility, which seems more realistic to me, is that he knows Joffrey is in danger but doesn’t care. After all, if Joffrey perished, Tywin (as Hand of the King) would be a strong candidate to oversee King’s Landing until Tommen is old enough to claim the throne. And do you really think the power-hungry patriarch doesn’t want to sit on the Iron Throne? Sure, he enjoys pulling the strings from behind the curtains, as he already has been while serving as Hand. But this is the guy who menacingly smirked as he witnessed the smelting of Ned Stark’s broadsword into a pair of Lannister swords. That look alone convinced me that Tywin has bigger plans than merely serving as Joffrey’s advisor.
Then again, perhaps I don’t have the polygraph sense of Maester Aemon — who delivered my favorite line of the episode after unilaterally dismissing the Night Watch’s treason charge against Jon Snow. By reminding the rest of the council, “I grew up in King’s Landing,” Maester Aemon substantiated his even-handed assessment of Snow, who, it turns out, does know something. The intel Snow gained from his time with the Wildlings likely saved his life, and set up an interesting season for the Night’s Watch — who I don’t foresee mixing very well with the newly introduced cannibalistic Thenns, even if the White Walkers manage to scale The Wall and threaten the livelihoods of everyone in Westeros.
Meanwhile, in the Far East, Daenerys is still strengthening her slave army and dragons — though it seems the latter will eventually spiral out of her control. Until then, however, it’s hard for me to muster much interest in her storyline, which has unfortunately devolved into an endless circle of encountering ruthless, enigmatic rulers, dispatching their soldiers with dragons, then marching onto the next city.
Still, “Two Swords” served as an excellent exposition for the upcoming season — and there’s still so much we don’t know. How will Bran and his fellow psychics affect the brewing war in the North? Will Stannis and Melisandre’s refocused neo-Wicca efforts have any impact on the White Walkers? Can Gendry make it back to King’s Landing in his dinghy? Will Theon — actually, after last season, maybe it’s better that Theon doesn’t have any scenes for a while. The guy deserves a break.
Anyway — at this point, it takes longer than an hour to touch on all of George R.R. Martin’s characters that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have integrated into Westeros. The good news is that they have plenty more time to do so, and we have plenty more time to enjoy it.

Oliver Mayer’s second-favorite dog was first called Monito, the Spanish word for little monkey. The small mixed-breed with chestnut fur and white spots was only about eight weeks old when Mayer, an associate professor of dramatic writing at USC and a resident faculty master at the Parkside International Residential College, got him.
More soup, sir · Oliver Mayer is a USC associate professor, resident faculty advisor, playwright and dog enthusiast who lives on campus. – Photo courtesy of Oliver Mayer
“We had this precedent of being close,” Mayer said.
Too young to stay home alone, the dog left the house with Mayer. He took him to class and to office hours. At the time, Mayer had a play running, so he took the dog to the play, and the play’s after party, where the name Don Aldo was thrown around in conversation. For some reason, the name resonated with Mayer. So that night, the dog came back to Mayer’s apartment in Parkside officially christened Don Aldo. He’s stayed by Mayer’s side ever since.
“There’s really not a shrub here that he hasn’t peed in and probably not too many undergraduates that he hasn’t at least sniffed around before,” Mayer said. “He knows everybody. He knows people I don’t even know, and they know him too.”
The connection that Don Aldo had made with the university and the people in it struck Mayer. Last fall, he began to toy with the idea of writing a book about the university through a dog’s eyes. And then he remembered that there had once been a famous dog that lived at USC: George Tirebiter.
“I thought, wow, 50 years later, maybe there’s an opportunity for another dog to be a representative,” Mayer said.
So he decided to write Don Aldo’s story, titled Big Dog on Campus, which hit stores today. He wanted the book to reflect the warmth he felt from being a part of the Trojan Family after he came to teach at the USC School of Theatre in 2003.
“I had a responsibility here, not simply to myself and my dog, but to a university where I’m employed and a place that I believe in,” Mayer said. “It may be that the single best thing to happen to me was coming to USC, because it gave me the opportunity to do my research — which is my plays — in a loving environment, and share what I know, and be able to have a life, get married and make a family, while following my art.”
When Mayer first started writing the book, he and Don Aldo walked to the statue of Tommy Trojan where the five Trojan values are listed. He wondered what those values would look like from a dog’s perspective.
“I thought, well, let me push this a little bit. If he comes in contact with those values, what might it mean to a dog who wants to be a better dog?” Mayer said. “That’s what the story’s about, a dog who just before his first birthday become aware of the Trojan values and strives to become a better Trojan and, in so doing, dreams about George Tirebiter, who helps him.”
In Big Dog on Campus, the theme of identity also helped add power to the story. Mayer’s mother is Mexican and his father was Anglo-American. Don Aldo, incidentally, is half St. Bernard, and half mixed breed, including traces of Corgi and Boxer. Mayer couldn’t resist having Don Aldo explore his own identity in the story.
“You can find your identity in so many ways,” Mayer said. “In the end, it’s your choice: How are you going to define yourself? You can’t stop these things — the chromosomes are what they are, people will see you the way they will. But that is not the end of your definition, only the beginning. It seems to me it’s maybe one of the most creative things we do, is figure out who we are and who we want to be.”
Mayer, who grew up in the Valley, said he first started writing because he liked to picture people, or in this case, dogs.
“When I was a little boy, I drew. My dad was an artist, and my dad thought I was really good, and my dad was a pretty discerning guy,” Mayer said. “Well, at a certain point, I never got any better. After about 8 years old, 10 years old, I still drew at that level, but I think I started to draw with words at that point.”
He attended North Hollywood High School and tested into the honors track. But Mayer said he wasn’t a good student until 11th grade, when his dad got sick and eventually died of cancer.
“That period kind of sobered me up, it woke me up,” Mayer said. “I wanted to do well for him, and I suddenly realized that if I were good academically, I might get to a better school and have a better life, so I did it.”
He went on to attend Cornell  University and then Columbia University. After working in theater for more than a decade, Mayer turned to teaching, first at UC Riverside and Art Center College of Design. Now at USC, Mayer is a professor and a residential faculty master as well as a playwright. Wearing multiple hats here has given him the chance to live on campus, work with students and write.
“This place is a magic place, and as soon as you step off, it’s another world,” Mayer said. “Nothing against the rest of the world, I love L.A., but it’s not this.”
His love of USC is what inspired Big Dog on Campus, which he hopes to turn into a series. For now, writing about Don Aldo has helped him get to know USC and his dog on a new level.
But Don Aldo is still Mayer’s second-favorite dog. The honor of being the great dog goes to Balder, Mayer’s pet growing up, who appears in Mayer’s most well-known work, Blade to the Heat.
“He was such a big part of our family,” Mayer said. “He went through life and death, the death of my father. He just loved us so much, and so I grew up around so much love with that dog.”
Still Don Aldo, who Mayer still refers to as Monito when he is acting like his former namesake, has made his own space in Mayer’s heart.Of course, it doesn’t hurt that he’s Mayer’s first Trojan canine.
“He’s getting real close to the great dog,” Mayer said with a smile.

HipTraveler, a startup founded by 1998 USC alumnus John Baumgartner, combines visual and social inspiration in order to simplify the travel-planning process for people. The online forum allows users to custom-build itineraries using beautiful images of destinations from around the world.
The idea for HipTraveler came from Baumgartner’s personal dissatisfaction with online travel planning.
“The average traveler visits 38 websites before he actually books travel, and spends three times as long travel-planning as he actually does traveling,” Baumgartner said. “So obviously there are some huge, huge problems there.”
When Baumgartner discussed this issue with his friends and family, he found that many people shared similar sentiments.
“Most people I talked to were very frustrated with the time that it takes to plan a trip,” Baumgartner said. “The resources that are on the web aren’t adequate for what people are looking for.”
HipTraveler, which officially launched on March 6, transforms travel-planning into an artistic and social experience. The site allows users to custom-build trips by simply dragging and dropping images of various activities into an itinerary. People choose a destination, then refine their search based on various categories such as dining, sight-seeing and nightlife.
“You’re actually taking visual inspiration and you’re turning it into something that’s actionable,” Baumgartner said. “Once you’ve built your itinerary via the imagery, that itinerary is now printable; it’s bookable and it’s sharable.”
Once someone completes an itinerary, other users can access it to gain ideas. If a user enjoys a particular guide or activity, he or she “hips” the post. “Hips” function similarly to “likes,” in that the most-hipped images appear on HipTraveler’s home page.
“We’re adding up the ‘hips’ on the back end so we can now rank everything by popularity,” Baumgartner said. “So, if you search for a Bali itinerary, for example, you’re gonna end up with the best of the best.”
Additionally, users can follow and message one another directly through the site. Through creating popular itineraries and demonstrating depth of knowledge about a particular region, users can become travel ambassadors.
Ambassadors serve as key resources for other travelers, answering questions and offering planning suggestions. Eventually, HipTraveler hopes to provide ambassadors with monetary rewards for their services.
Baumgartner described how USC’s diverse student body has contributed to developing the ambassador program.
“Obviously USC having more international students than any other university in the country was the perfect fit for us,” Baumgartner said.
James Bottom, the vice president of business development, recruited students from countries such as Mexico and Turkey to design insider’s guides to their home cities.
“We would love to be able to go hire the entire IR graduating class to become ambassadors,” Bottom said. “They have the perfect background for exactly what we need.”
HipTraveler targets people searching for dynamic and unique travel experiences, known as “adventure travelers.”
“[Adventure travelers] don’t want to cruise. We’re not focused on the cruise segment,” Baumgartner said. “We’re focused on the segment of the market that wants to do a more adventurous trip … If you’re just going to Hawaii and you’re staying at the Marriott, that’s a little different trip. That’s much, much easier to plan.”
Baumgartner added that the up-and-coming generation of travelers are also more visually and socially driven.
“This is the Instagram, Tumblr generation of people. So they are used to seeing things presented visually. They get it,” he said.
Baumgartner and Bottom identified their audience as “young millennials” with high levels of disposable income. In the future, they hope to accommodate more cost-conscious travelers, including USC students looking to explore local destinations.
“We kicked around a way to see HipTraveler as focusing on some of these weekender-type trips for the students on campus,” Baumgartner said. “So it is part of the ambassador program, for us to pay special attention to these folks and create mini-excursions for them.”
Baumgartner and Bottom’s long-term goal is to develop a database with thousands of itineraries for local and global destinations. Eventually, they hope that HipTraveler will become an invaluable resource for people to discover travel plans that satisfy their eclectic interests.

USA Water Polo honored USC men’s and women’s head coach Jovan Vavic with the Monte Nitzkowski Distinguished Men’s Coaching Award on Monday. The award, annually given at the USA Water Polo Hall of Fame Induction and National Awards Dinner, honored Vavic for his contributions to the USA Water Polo program. A native of the former Yugoslavia, Vavic took over head coaching duties for the USA Men’s Senior National Team last year on an interim basis, helping the team qualify for the 2013 FINA World Championships.
The skipper · In 19 years at USC, Jovan Vavic has won 13 national titles and 12 National Coach of the Year Awards. Last fall, Vavic claimed a record sixth consecutive national championship with the men’s squad. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Vavic has been remarkably successful in his 19-year tenure at USC. In that timespan, he won a combined 13 national titles and 12 National Coach of the Year awards with the men’s and women’s programs. He has led the men’s team to a record six consecutive national championships in the past six seasons, a record the Trojans will put to the test once again next fall. Last week, Vavic’s women’s team lost for the first time in 28 games, a streak dating back to the team’s 2013 National Championship season.
Recently USC water polo has been a family affair for Vavic  — he has coached both his son Nikola and his daughter Monica to great individual success. Nikola, who won four consecutive national championships with the Trojans from 2010-2013, was a four-time All-American and two-time National Player of the Year. He also became the school’s all-time leading scorer as a senior.
Monica, a junior on the women’s team, has already become one of the best players in program history. She is a two-time first team All-American, and was named the MPSF Player of the Year last season. Her 57 goals so far in 2014 are currently tops for the Women of Troy.
Though he graduated from crosstown rival UCLA, the elder Vavic will certainly be remembered as one of the greatest Trojans of all time. Next year will be his 20th year coaching the men’s squad — in the last 19 years, the team has finished outside the top three in the country just five times. Since 1996, when the USC women’s team entered Division I play, the Women of Troy have finished outside the top three only seven times. Jovan and Monica are back in action tomorrow afternoon when they host No. 11 Loyola Marymount at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

This time last year, the USC Trojans’ spring camp was marked by a three-way quarterback battle between then-incumbent starter Max Wittek, Cody Kessler and spring recruit Max Browne. This year, Wittek is gone and everyone moves up one: Incumbent starting quarterback Cody Kessler and Max Browne are officially competing for the starting job this spring, but if you hear it from anyone with eyes present at Howard Jones Field (including head coach Steve Sarkisian himself), it’s not much of a battle.
Blue chip · Redshirt freshman Max Browne was recruited by former coach Lane Kiffin as one of the best high school players in the country. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Kessler has been making serious strides at quarterback this spring and outpacing the younger Browne, who looks to have secured the backup role. Barring Browne miraculously mastering the playbook and reaching missile-throwing self-actualization in a matter of a week, it looks likely that Sarkisian will be going with Cody Kessler to be at the helm in this season’s opener against Fresno State.
Though Sarkisian preaches a run-first approach in his  fast-paced offense, it wouldn’t be terribly surprising to see the Trojans throw in (no pun intended) a play action on second or third-and-short situations. At this point, the quarterback’s accuracy and arm strength come into play.
Let’s be honest with ourselves: Last year’s passing attack was underwhelming. It’s also perfectly appropriate to feel that the upcoming season’s prospects are a bit grim: It hurts to see Marcus Martin go, but Marqise Lee’s departure is a big blow to the Trojans’ air attack. Nelson Agholor is an exciting receiver with serious skills — but he’s not quite Marqise Lee or Robert Woods just yet.
At the helm of this passing attack last season was Kessler, who managed to throw enough check-downs, screens and intermediate routes last season to finish with a 65 percent completion percentage. But prior to the Las Vegas Bowl, Kessler had amassed a rather pedestrian 16 touchdowns and six interceptions through thirteen games. Following the departure of former interim head coach Ed Orgeron, however, the Trojans regrouped and did as Trojans do: They made it rain in Las Vegas. Kessler completed 22 of 30 passes en route to four touchdowns and a season-high 345 yards.
Sarkisian heavily recruited Browne when the former was head coach at Washington and the latter was setting school records at Skyline High School in Sammamish, Wa. The Sark undoubtedly got an earful from the Huskies’ fans when he failed to recruit a quarterback who had essentially grown up in UW’s backyard. Browne, the No. 2 pocket passer in the nation at the time, came to USC to play under former head coach Lane Kiffin, and Sarkisian just happened to meet up with him later.
What’s intriguing about Browne as a quarterback prospect is his professional-level height. Standing a full four inches taller than the 6-foot-1 (if even that) Kessler, Browne is reminiscent of another lanky USC quarterback who went on to have some success in the NFL: Matt Cassel. Browne’s greatest assets in high school were his instincts and anticipation.
On a brief perusal of Browne’s highlight tape from Skyline High School, it becomes immediately obvious that he has a distinct mental advantage over the hapless, outsized defenders. Three out of the first five plays on tape are situations in which the pocket breaks down and Browne finds a way to “make it work,” including a beautiful Tony Romo-esque strong-side rollout where he threads a needle between two defenders to a slanting receiver in the endzone. The trouble with translating this type of mental skillset to the college level is that Browne’s mind and body will have to adapt to the increased speed of the college game. Browne candidly stated that the speed of the game at the college level was his primary challenge as an incoming freshman.
It’s practically unimaginable that Browne will get the start against a Fresno State team that Kessler so gleefully eviscerated in last season’s Las Vegas Bowl game, but should the unthinkable happen to Kessler, Sarkisian might have quite the quarterback laying in the weeds, waiting his turn.
With five spring practices remaining, the battle for starting quarterback is considered essentially over. But with class of 2015 recruit Ricky Town committing to USC for the upcoming season, so is Browne’s window to compete for a starting spot. The Trojans are in good hands, for now. But don’t expect Browne to be the bridesmaid forever: the mental aspect of the college game might click at any second for a player like Browne, and that’s going to be a scary day for the rest of the Pac-12.

After suffering a heartbreaking 9-5 loss last week to Stanford in a 2013 National Championship rematch, snapping a 27-game winning streak dating back to last season, the USC women’s water polo team wasted no time starting a new winning streak on Sunday.
O Captain! · Senior Kaleigh Gilchrist scored two goals against UC Irvine on Sunday, enough to move her up to No. 13 on USC’s all-time scoring list. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The No. 2 Women of Troy (21-1, 4-1 MPSF) jumped back into the pool in the comforts of the Uytengsu Aquatics Center against No. 6 UC Irvine, coming away with a 16-5 victory. The Anteaters (17-7) entered the contest on a seven-game winning streak of their own that was brought to a sudden halt.
After trading goals early on, the Cardinal and Gold were able to extend a 4-2 first quarter lead into a 10-2 halftime advantage. Senior two-meter Colleen O’Donnell tallied a first-half hat trick to lead the Women of Troy into intermission.
Unlike the second period, the Anteaters thwarted the USC attack to begin the third quarter. Both teams registered three goals in the eight-minute period, bringing the score to 13-5. The fourth period, though, was no contest for the Women of Troy.
In the quarter, junior two-meter Eike Daube tallied a career-high fifth goal of the match and junior driver Monica Vavic picked up a hat trick of her own, propelling her to sole possession of fifth place in scoring in program history. The Women of Troy polished off the visiting UCI bunch, 16-5.
“It’s great to see Eike step up as a junior,” said senior captain Kaleigh Gilchrist. “We saw sparks of it freshman and sophomore year, and then for her to take on a completely different role this year is awesome because we need as many people as possible.”
Though the offense proved dominant across the board, it was the stellar play on the defensive end of the pool that kept the Women of Troy ahead. The dynamic defense blanked the Anteaters on the scoreboard in both the second and final quarter. Anchoring the defensive unit was senior goalie Flora Bolonyai, who recorded 13 saves.
“Flora has been our team’s best player, in my opinion,” said Gilchrist, who punched in two goals in the victory. “To have someone that great with that much experience in the cage is awesome.”
The USC victory on Sunday brings the overall series record against UCI to an astonishing 22-3.
“It’s just really important to bounce back after a tough loss and get refocused and realize that we still have a lot of work to do in a short amount of time,” Gilchrist said. “I think that we were able to do that and prove it against UCI. We just want to keep the momentum alive after the UCI win.”
The Women of Troy now have their sights on extending this new win streak as they prepare to face off against No. 11 Loyola Marymount (17-10) on Thursday afternoon at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
The Lions enter the match winning four of their last five games, with the sole loss coming at the hands of a San Diego State goal with 0.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With Loyola hungry to avenge the tough loss, the Women of Troy are prepared for a grueling game.
“We still have a lot of areas to work on so we will just be focusing on that in practice,” Gilchrist said. “We only have two practices before the LMU game so we need to stay really focused and hopefully execute on Thursday.”
Tomorrow’s game is the second-to-last regular season contest before USC plays host to the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament. The game is slated to start at 4:30 p.m. and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

The greatest takeaway from the team’s 10th spring practice is that head coach Steve Sarkisian is moving closer to being ready to name a starting quarterback. This announcement is most likely to occur before spring practice ends.
Sark times · Head coach Steve Sarkisian will have to choose between redshirt freshman Max Browne and returning starter Cody Kessler at the quarterback position. Both players have been inconsistent this spring. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
“When I have a pretty good feeling of it, I’m going to let it sit for a little bit,” Sarkisian said. “I suspect we would do it before the end of the spring.”
Both redshirt freshman Max Browne and the incumbent in redshirt junior Cody Kessler entered the fourth week of the spring dueling for that highly touted No. 1 spot on the depth chart.
Though Kessler has the experience of battling for the starting job, as he did last spring, Sarkisian thought that neither quarterback separated himself.
“I thought it was a hard day for the quarterbacks,” Sarkisian said. “Some things going on around them and how they responded to them made it difficult.”
Silent Snaps 
The offense worked on a silent snap count for the first time this spring, which caused some errant snaps. Sarkisian explained that this can really take the air out of practice.
After having one of the deepest backfields in the nation, the Trojans had only one healthy scholarship running back on Tuesday in redshirt junior Tre Madden, who continues to carry a heavy load this spring.
With junior Javorious “Buck” Allen and sophomore Ty Issac out, walk-on quarterback Connor Sullivan practiced at tailback.
Madden asserted that expectations are always high at USC and that with the team’s new high-potent offense and imposing defense, the team will be a force to be reckoned with next season.
“We were a young team last year and we are going to have more experience this year,” Madden said.
At the wide receiver position, junior Nelson Agholor continued his spectacular spring, catching another long touchdown pass. He pulled one in from 75 yards out in Saturday’s scrimmage.
Sophomore Darreus Rogers continues to emerge as the No. 2 wide receiver, but still has some things to work on, Sarkisian said.
“He needs to develop [a] consistency factor, and then show it all the time,” Sarkisian said.
No Pads, No Problem 
The defense received praise from Sarkisian once again for their energy on their side of the ball, resulting in a lot of forced throws that resulted in turnovers while also getting third-down stops.
“I thought the defense showed great intensity today,” Sarkisian said. “I thought they executed a lot better than they did on Saturday.”
Senior defensive back Gerald Bowman and redshirt junior defensive lineman Antwaun Woods were given credit for their level of activity in practice.
Even with Josh Shaw, Su’a Cravens and Leonard Williams out, the defense continued to get the better of the offense.
“We have a chance to be really good when you factor in those three guys mixed with the development of our other players,” Sarkisian said.
He also mentioned how advantageous it is that the team has 22 quality players on defense.
Quick Takes 
2015 quarterback David Sills, who is verbally committed to the Trojans, visited practice on Tuesday. Sills was recruited in seventh grade at the age of 13 by former USC head coach Lane Kiffin. He will go on to visit Kiffin and Alabama later in the week.
Tuesday’s practice was the third of three practices to be played with no pads this spring.

On April 7, the Daily Trojan published a column by Rini Sampath on the lack of unity among women, particularly when it comes to addressing and fighting injustice. Sampath used the critiques people have leveled against Sheryl Sandberg’s bestselling book Lean In as an example of “a glaring problem with the women’s empowerment movement:” women not standing together in solidarity. Though I agree with many of the points Sampath made, I view the unity issue among women, especially within feminism, from a different perspective.
In our culture, there’s an idea that having disagreements and critiquing someone’s ideas or work is inherently divisive. But I disagree. Within a movement such as the one for women’s empowerment, everyone has different experiences and those experiences may not all align with one another. What I think is truly divisive is when no room is allowed for discussion and acceptance of differing viewpoints and needs within a movement. For example, within the feminist movement, the issues that affect all women are significant. Mainstream American feminism, however, has an unfortunate history of middle and upper-middle class white women being perceived as advocates for all women, when in reality they have unintentionally and sometimes purposely excluded other women from the feminist narrative. Sheryl Sandberg, whether she meant to or not, didn’t do justice to working-class women and women of color in Lean In, which is positioned as a book for all women. Issues specific to women of color, trans women, working-class women and queer women are often overlooked within the feminist movement. This is obviously problematic on its own, but what I think is worse is when people who try to address differences, inequality and privilege are squeezed out or told to keep quiet.
The issue of exclusion and prioritization within feminism hasn’t gone away. In 2013, feminist Mikki Kendall was driven to create the hashtag #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen after becoming fed up with the online trend she had noticed of many feminists of color being harassed and dismissed as “divisive to the movement” whenever they brought up how issues faced by women of color are often left out of the main discussion.
Sampath is definitely right in a sense. There is a huge problem of unity within the large and diverse feminist movement and between women in general. The solution, however, is not to tell women coming from more marginalized circumstances to keep quiet when successful, self-proclaimed feminists garner wide media attention for their messages that are, for better or worse, coming from greater places of privilege. Real solidarity cannot happen without intersectionality. It doesn’t come at the expense of inclusion nor should people with different, less popular opinions be expected to stay quiet lest their genuine concerns and critiques be misconstrued as fragmenting to unity among women. For the feminist movement to be successful, healthy skepticism and self-criticism are necessities we must take upon ourselves. It can be uncomfortable to disagree with one another and address privilege in a group in which everyone has faced some sort of marginalization, but it needs to be done if we as women truly want to unite and empower one another.
As someone who is in the process of reading Lean In, I can assert that there are plenty of constructive messages that I can take from it as a woman. As a woman of color, however, there are plenty parts of the book to which I can’t relate, making Lean In positioned as a guide for all women troubling. Still, I’m not interested in throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Feminism isn’t perfect. Lean In isn’t perfect, but acknowledging the imperfections isn’t divisive, it’s simply part of the glorious process called progress.
I advocate for all women to try to understand one another better, acknowledge that all women come from different places and have different primary concerns, and for women from more privileged backgrounds to make a concrete effort to include the issues faced by women of more marginalized identities. We shouldn’t close our ears to genuine critiques and discussions about problematic aspects of it but embrace those critiques and improve the movement for everyone involved.

Senior, creative writing
 
YES. This is exactly how I felt after reading “To fight injustice, women must be unified.” Most of the criticisms of Sheryl Sandberg are not tearing down her as a person or as a feminist, but rather the fact that her advice is not nearly as universal or helpful as she thinks. Service workers like maids and jobs held by other women outside of the corporate workplace cannot just go to their boss and demand more rights. They lack the job security and support to do so. 
Women who raise this point are not being divisive; it’s a legitimate criticism of Lean In. Standing together means that white feminists like Sandberg need to learn to listen to other narratives outside of mainstream feminism, not that all feminists should conform to one viewpoint.
I absolutely agree with Corinne.
When you have that type of power and you waste it on banning words when their are organizations ran by women who are changing lives who can’t get this type of media attention or support. They are ignored because their founders do not have the social status. Her meaning of Lean in can’t be the same as mine.
Those very children she may be using in her ads, what are their home life like?   There are more Mothers whom  are head of the households now creating opportunities for women and truly supporting women and not just using lip service for marketing  to sell your book is the answer. Everyday women are hurting and struggling to feed their families something she can’t relate too.

When I was matriculating through elementary and high school, one of my least favorite aspects of any educational experience was lunchtime but not because I disliked the 45 free minutes to gossip, do homework and eat. I was wary of lunchtime because of the school’s limited options for lunch food.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, the same wariness is being felt at lunchtime — but in this case among school administrators and employees within the district’s food services department. According to the Los Angeles Times, LAUSD students throw out approximately $100,000 worth of food each day. Due to the massive waste, the nation’s second-largest school district is discussing ways to reduce waste while maintaining federal nutrition standards.
It is important to teach students early on about the environment and how it affects their health. The school system should revise some of its policies that lead to students wasting unwanted food and focus on other ways of educating them on the critical issues of nutrition and environmentalism.
The discussion surrounding the growing amount of student waste was elevated when the federal school meal rules were finalized in 2012. The rules, according to the United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, stipulate that schools must increase the availability of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fat-free milk while also reducing the levels of sodium and trans fat in meals. Though these changes work to enhance the diet and health of school children, will they ever learn its true importance if it’s forced upon them?
More of the district’s resources should be focused on how to be more environmentally friendly, especially in a city such as Los Angeles that is overpopulated and consistently attempting to make itself more eco-friendly.
By stressing the importance of being environmentally friendly and not wasting food that you don’t like, students can take so much more away from the experience of lunchtime. If school administrators focus on educating students about why it is not okay to waste the food they don’t like, it can turn into a better lesson on the benefits of why eating fruits and vegetables is necessary.
This is also a wise and important financial decision on the district’s part. The cost to feed children in U.S. public schools has grown over the years. It costs $11.6 billion to fund the federal school lunch program, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Some of those sizable funds can go to educating students on the environment. Currently, the national average for plate waste at K-12 schools is around 12 percent, according to the Food Assistance & Nutrition Research Program.
Furthermore, 80 percent of LAUSD students are eligible to receive not only a free or reduced price lunch but also a free or reduced price breakfast. With the multiple free meals a day, the waste accrued is more costly than students not receiving both their servings of fruit and vegetables.
Unfortunately for some LAUSD students, school is the only place where they receive fresh food and vegetables. There is also no denying that exposure to fruits and vegetables will make students more likely to lead healthier lifestyles and reduce their chances of becoming overweight, but there are other routes to getting children into healthier patterns.
But the pattern right now shows that even when forced to have a vegetable or fruit on their plate, students are resisting. Therefore, another solution should be pursued.
“What can we do about this?” David Binkle, director of LAUSD food services, said to the Los Angeles Times. “We can stop forcing children take food they don’t like and throw in the garbage.”
Healthy school lunches are necessary. As an institution designated for learning, schools are the place where teachers and administrators can instill into students the importance of eating healthy and maintaining active lifestyles. One way to achieve this aim is through keeping the fruits and vegetables available to students.
School systems must be realistic about how much change they can make when educating students on both healthy eating patterns and waste reduction. But if policies are revised and game plans are worked in conjunction with one another, the food challenges students face during lunchtime can begin to be nibbled away at.

Cutting waste is a noble goal – and common sense.
