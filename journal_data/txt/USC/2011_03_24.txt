Almost two-thirds of the way through the season, the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team has faced a bevy of challenges, but answered all of them with victorious pushes.
Returning · The Trojans’ offensive efficiency took a notable drop against Pepperdine with senior middle block Austin Zahn sidelined with an injury. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (15-1, 14-1) have amassed nine wins since an early February loss to Pepperdine and have already clinched a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament berth. USC is also three games ahead of second-place Stanford.
USC now faces a crucial home match with the Waves (8-11, 4-11), which served up the Trojans with their only loss this season.
“Every match down this final stretch is important,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin.
In the loss last month, the Trojans were also without starting middle blocker Austin Zahn due to injury. Zahn’s absence took away from the Trojans’ efficiency — the team finished with a .292 hitting average, considerably lower than the season .357 average.
“We didn’t pass the ball well last time and didn’t serve well,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “And to their credit, they served the ball exceptionally well last match.”
Because of Zahn’s absence, the three pin-hitters — senior opposite Murphy Troy, senior outside hitter Tri Bourne and junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli — finished with 55 of the team’s 65 kills.
“It sucks sitting on the bench during a loss,” Zahn said. “I’m definitely fired up and am going to make sure my presence is felt.”
With Zahn in the lineup, the Trojans are the most efficient offensive team in the MPSF, sporting a league-leading .357 hitting percentage. McKibbin leads the conference with 12.98 assists per set.
The Trojans are also the most stingy defensive team in the conference, allowing a league-best .244 hitting percentage for their opponents. They also lead the league in digs, with 9.90 per set. This includes freshman libero Henry Cassiday, who is second in the league in digs, and McKibbin, who ranks seventh.
“I really like how we keep improving,” Ferguson said. “Our season, especially the last two weeks, have played out just how we wanted it to.”
USC worked through a nine-game break between the Harvard match played during spring break and Friday’s match against Pepperdine.
In the three weeks before the break, USC played two sets of back-to-back matches and had three of six matches go to five sets.
“We had some tough, tough matches right before the break,” Ferguson said. “They took a lot out of us physically. With the extra time, we’ve been able to increase the intensity of our weight training and get to another level strength-and-conditioning-wise.”
Although the Trojans have not allowed the thought of revenge to overshadow their dutiful preparation, they recognize their record is tarnished by the February match.
“We’ve beaten UCLA, [assistant coach] Jeff Nygaard’s alma mater, and Cal State Northridge, [assistant coach] Cameron Green’s alma mater,” McKibbin said with a smile. “The only coach we haven’t beaten so far is [assistant coach] J.J. Riley. It’s almost personal.”
First serve is at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.
Come out and celebrate our #1 USC TROJAN Volleyball Team.  These Dudes are super cool and fun to watch.
Revenge tastes better when its cold….but seeing it LIVE is a real treat.  Good Luck, and save me a sideline dance….or two……Trojanelli wants the place hoppin and loud and Super Proud of all the Hard Work these fine men have put in.
FIGHT ON 4 EVER

After splitting last week’s pair of matches, the No. 13 USC women’s tennis team heads into the thick of its Pac-10 schedule.
First up for the Women of Troy (11-3, 1-0) is a match with No. 10 California (11-4, 2-0) today as they look to avenge last year’s two defeats, one of which knocked USC out of the NCAA tournament.
Hot streak · Though top-ranked teams in California, Stanford await, senior Maria Sanchez has notched 22 consecutive wins in singles play. - Daily Trojan file photo 
The Golden Bears boast three ranked singles players, No. 4 Jana Juricova, No. 48 Tayler Davis and No. 57 Annie Goransson, all of whom will pose a challenge to USC coach Richard Gallien’s group.
Senior Maria Sanchez in particular will have her hands full with Juricova, who was the 2009 ITA National Indoor Championship singles champion. Held out of last year’s NCAA tournament because of a wrist injury, the Slovakian hasn’t missed a beat this season and represents the kind of top competition Sanchez will have to face in her quest to win a national title.
Despite last week’s troubles, Sanchez ran through the competition, breezing through ASU’s No. 17 Kelcy McKenna, to record her 22nd consecutive singles win.
Sophomore Danielle Lao has seen her play slip as of late because of some elbow discomfort, even sitting out the Syracuse match. Lao looks to rebound from her previous matches when she faces Cal’s Davis, as well as Stanford’s Nicole Gibbs or Mallory Burdette, who currently sit at No. 11 and No. 29, respectively.
No. 2 Stanford (14-0, 2-0) boasts a total of five singles players ranked among the nation’s best, more than either USC or Cal.
Jousting with No. 1 Sanchez all year, among the nation’s top singles player, No. 2 Hilary Barte, also a senior, has a chance to make her case for the top spot Saturday.
Freshman Kaitlyn Christian, who had her first win in second singles last week, will have to continue her strong play over the weekend if the Women of Troy have any hope to squeeze out victories against their two top-10 opponents.
Facing arguably her toughest competition this season (along with UCLA’s Andrea Remynse), Christian will have to display the type of poise that has garnered her continual praise from Gallien in order to be successful against Cal and Stanford.
At the back end of singles, junior Alison Ramos and senior Cristala Andrews might not know exactly who they will face, as Stanford has shuffled around their lineup all season long, but they can rest assured it will be top competition.
“It’s a tough one this weekend,” Gallien said. “We match up really well with Stanford and it’s good to play them at home.”

The timetable for Marc Tyler’s return remains uncertain, according to the senior running back, who sat out of practice Thursday with a hamstring injury.
Tyler pulled his hamstring while running a pass route Tuesday, the Trojans’ first day of spring workouts. He said he does not expect to return next week and could miss the entire spring.
Injuries · Senior tailback Marc Tyle was sidelined indefinitely after pulling a hamstring during Tuesday’s practice, the first of  spring training. - Daily Trojan file photo 
“I’m going to try to [return before spring football ends],” Tyler said. “But I don’t want to rush back and hurt it worse.”
Immediately after suffering the injury, Tyler expressed frustration that he did not stretch properly.
“My legs didn’t feel good all practice,” he said.
The Trojans start practice at 7:25 a.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays rather than in the afternoon, as in previous years. There has also been a change in the stretching schedule, according to Tyler. He said the team did not go through its full stretching regiment at the start of practice and only did a quick dynamic stretching session.
“I guess they want us to come in earlier and stretch before,” Tyler said. “I didn’t know they changed it.”
With the start of the season more than five months away, Tyler remains positive.
“It’s not really frustrating, I’ve just got to rehab,” he said.
USC coach Lane Kiffin does not expect the injury to set Tyler back, even if he does miss the entire spring.
“It’s a long ways away until we play a real game,” Kiffin said. “Obviously you’d like to have him to continue to develop his game. But hopefully he’ll get healthy here and he’ll still get some work this spring.”

It appears the morning workouts are here to stay. Kiffin indicated the Trojans would likely continue holding early practices during the fall when the season gets under way.
“We just had a final schedule that we looked at, so it looks like that we are [going to practice early in the fall],” Kiffin said.
Kiffin said the early schedule provides a number of benefits for his players.
“It’s very beneficial to our guys to have great energy,” Kiffin said. “It’s a lot easier for their bodies to have good practices that start at seven in the morning as opposed to going through the whole day of class and lunch and getting out here at four in the afternoon. It benefits [them] academically because they’re up right now going to class.”
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley is still adjusting to the change.
“I’m getting used to it,” Barkley said. “It’s just different, you just kind of have to shift your clock. I like being out here, you kind of get it out of the way and move on with the rest of your day.”

The defense put up a solid showing Thursday, intercepting three passes during team drills. Barkley threw two interceptions while freshman Cody Kessler threw one. 
“The defense did well today,” Barkley said. “We gotta do a better job on offense of protecting the ball and just get our chemistry down.”
The offensive rhythm appeared off for most of the morning, which is to be expected with the Trojans’ combination of injuries on the offensive line and inexperience at receiver.
“We have a lot of young guys, a lot of guys with not a lot of experience,” Barkley said. 
Kiffin was pleased to see the defense show early signs of progress.
“We led the world in explosive plays [allowed] last year at any level,” Kiffin said. “It’s good to see, through two days, us get better. We’re going to be better this year.”

With time winding down in the USC men’s basketball team’s last home game last month, junior forward Nikola Vucevic stepped to the line to take two free throws.
As he prepared to shoot, a faint “one more year” chant could be heard coming from the student section.
This continued as the game reached its final seconds, and while the chant was intended for Vucevic, it could have easily applied to another man on the USC bench: coach Kevin O’Neill.
After USC exited the NCAA tournament as quickly as it entered, questions about O’Neill’s job status hit the Internet. USC has been mediocre during O’Neill’s two years at the helm and there are few signs the program is rapidly improving.
O’Neill did exceed expectations by getting into the tournament this year, but his team’s inconsistent play remains a concern.
Yet, with that in mind, O’Neill deserves one more year to show significant improvement in the basketball program.
O’Neill is the coaching equivalent of a journeyman. He has been to a lot of places, never failing, but never enjoying great success either. He has been to the tournament a couple of times, but never made a huge dent.
Based on past experiences, it’s reasonable to assume O’Neill is not going to turn USC basketball into an annual Pac-10 contender.
Since he’s only been here two years, however, it would be unfair of USC to fire him this summer. He hasn’t fully had a chance to make his mark on the sanction-plagued program, thanks to former coach Tim Floyd.
He also hasn’t had a chance to bring in a lot of recruits, which is important when establishing if a coach is succeeding in a particular environment.
O’Neill has two recruits above an 89 rating, according to ESPN.com, coming in next year, as well as 2009-10 Big Ten Honorable Mention forward Aaron Fuller and center James Blasczyk, a former Texas A&M player and one-time top-50 high school recruit in Texas
It’s not the class John Calipari gets every year at Kentucky, but it’s a solid ragtag group of players, who could come together to help USC to the next level.
But we won’t know until next year, when O’Neill gets the chance to implement his system with the guys he recruited.
If significant improvement — and by that I mean more consistent play, not losing to teams nobody has ever heard of, and becoming a lock for the NCAA tournament — isn’t made, it would be right for Haden to look elsewhere for someone who can lead USC basketball into the elite of the Pac-12.
Now before you snap and say USC basketball will never be Pac-12 elite material or USC basketball isn’t important, consider this: Not only is the Galen Center, built just five years ago, begging for a headlining act, but the entire Pac-12 is begging for someone to step up and be the face of the conference.
Five different teams have won the conference title in the last five years.
If O’Neill can’t get the program on the rise next year, the only way for Pat Haden to fix that is to hire a big name coach and it just so happens there will likely be one on the market next year.
Yup, I’m talking about former Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl.
Despite all the sanctions, I think most would agree Pearl would be a great fit for the Trojan program. He’s young, colorful and a great marketer. He’s also a big name recruits can gravitate to.
He does have a lot of baggage, however, which is why it would be unwise for USC to even think about him now.
If Haden even hinted he were thinking about Pearl, that would not only send the wrong message to the NCAA Committee of Infractions but would also contradict the delicate reputation Haden has built for the USC athletics program in the past nine months.
Yes, Pearl lied to the NCAA, which is obviously a big no-no. And no, that wasn’t his only offense. Yet, I believe he is truly remorseful and deserves a second chance. And there is no place he would be under a sharper watch than at USC.
I’m aware the Committee on Infractions can give him a two-year show-cause penalty, meaning any place that hires him needs to get approval from the committee first, but Tennessee dismissed Pearl more for its overall athletic reputation than the health of its basketball program.
Barring any extensive penalties handed down to Pearl by the NCAA this summer, if O’Neill can’t show he’s bringing the program to another level after this season, Haden would be wrong to discount Pearl as a replacement once the talk and feelings about his illicit activity die down. But O’Neill definitely deserves this next year to prove his worth.

The real troublemaker was Mike Garrett who pushed hard for O.J. Mayo to help fill the arena. He is the one who knew about Rodney Guillory and all his baggage from the days of Jeff Trep. Floyd would have done well for the Trojans with adding Williams and Jones to the team last year. Brad Stevens would be ideal just signed a very long term extension with Butler a few weeks ago. It is time for a Jewish coach Pearl since every other religion has been represented on the court over the years by the coaching staff.
I think USC should let KO go. He never proved that he is a winer. Arizona was smart to kick him out 3 years ago. Look at Arizona now, can you imaging if KO stayed there. Don’t forget Sean Miller has been with Arizona for only 2 years. Trojans need look for some young guys like Brad Stevens instead of trouble makers, like Tim Floyd, KO or Bruce Pearl. Go trojans!

USC baseball takes on No. 24 UCLA in a three-game weekend series starting tonight at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.
The conference opener for both teams is actually their second meeting of the season, as USC (8-13) shut out the Bruins (9-7) two weeks ago at Dodger Stadium during the Dodgertown Classic. Tonight will feature promotional giveaways, including concert tickets and an iPad, among others.
Pitching like an ace · During his last meeting against UCLA at Dodger Stadium during the Dodgertown Classic, senior starter Logan Odom pitched seven and one-third scoreless innings en route to earning Pac-10 Player of the Week honors. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Senior pitcher Logan Odom went seven and one-third scoreless that day, and the Trojans got a pair off Bruin pitcher Adam Plutko to take a 2-0 victory. The two will return to the mound reprise the matchup Sunday.
The Friday opener will feature Trojan junior right-hander Andrew Triggs (2-1, 4.20 ERA) against UCLA star Gerrit Cole (1-2, 1.67 ERA). Cole boasts a mid-90’s fastball, a changeup and a power slider. He was drafted by the New York Yankees 28th overall in 2008 but turned down a reported $4 million contract to go to school.
“He’s legitimate,” said USC coach Frank Cruz. “He’s gotta be one of the top draft prospects in the country. He’s got command, he’s got everything. He’s the real deal.”
For Triggs, it’s all about not getting too caught up in the rivalry and the matchup.
“It’s more special than other starts,” Triggs said. “But if you start making it into more than it is you get in trouble. You try to treat it like any other start, but you know the implications.”
With junior right fielder Alex Sherrod out with an ankle injury, the Trojans will look to sophomore Alex Glenn to step up and fill the gap. Glenn is hitting just .182 with three RBIs this season, but he does have a pair of homers to his name.
“It’s a big deal,” Glenn said. “I’m not even from California, but I know how important the rivalry is. When we won earlier [at Dodger Stadium] it was one of the best feelings I’ve had as a Trojan.”
After Cole in the Bruin’s rotation comes junior Trevor Bauer and his 1.40 ERA.
“There’s no let up in their pitching,” Cruz said. “That’s the way they’ve been for years. Doesn’t matter what their record is, they can pitch. They’re just a good ball club.”
Bauer will take the hill against Trojan junior Austin Wood (1-3, 5.06 ERA) on Saturday before Plutko-Odom repeats itself Sunday.
Although a matchup with the Bruins is motivation in and of itself, the fact that the series will open up Pac-10 play makes it even more important to the Trojans.
“What better way to start?” Triggs said.
As always, the conference is loaded. Six of the 10 teams are currently ranked by Baseball America, and eight have found their way into the top 25 at some point this season.
“The Pac-10 is as good as it’s been in a long time,” Cruz said.
Glenn took it a step further. “It’s almost like a minor league. Every team is stacked,” he said.
Ultimately, it boils down to the rivalry. The eyes of players and coaches alike light up when asked about the chance to play the Bruins. The excitement is palpable all around the program.
“This is why people come to USC or UCLA,” Cruz said. “To play in this rivalry. You gotta love it.”

Los Angeles is home to countless aspiring actors with dreams of making it big. For USC alumnus Eric Ladin, who graduated in 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in theatre, his dream is starting to look like reality. Ladin co-stars in a new AMC original series, The Killing, set to debut April 3. He has also had roles in HBO’s Generation Kill and Big Love, AMC’s Mad Men and several other shows. The Daily Trojan spoke with Ladin in a phone interview.
Experienced · Eric Ladin will star in a new AMC original series. - Courtesy of Joan Allen Photography 
 
Daily Trojan: When did you feel like you had first broken out as an actor?
Eric Ladin: The first role that I felt like I started establishing my foothold was Generation Kill, because I had been kind of bouncing around and doing a lot of guest star work before that. After Generation Kill, more high-caliber work started to come consistently, and I haven’t really slowed down since.
 
DT: What was it like working on such an immersive miniseries as Generation Kill?
Ladin: It was an incredible experience, and one that will probably never be matched in my career. I spent seven months in Africa with 30 guys, all of whom I’ve become very good friends with. We really did start to get the sense of being away — not that we could ever think that we were really in the military, but it was a little bit of life imitating art in the sense that we had left our loved ones at home for seven months and spent all day in a Humvee. Once we started rolling, we had no choice but to start talking and acting like soldiers.
 
DT: What is one of the toughest parts of being an actor that gets hidden by the glamour?
Ladin: It’s a very uncertain lifestyle. You hope to be busy and working on great projects, but it can be a very unstable lifestyle and that’s not always the case. Usually once the momentum gets going though, you can ride that and continue to do great work, and great projects continue to come along.
 
DT: Did you always feel like you wanted to be an actor?
Ladin: It’s something I’ve always wanted to do, and then I finally started embracing theatre when I was in junior high and really started focusing on it in high school. Then I decided to go to USC, and I made that decision not only because of the theatre program but also because it was in L.A. and I wanted to have that opportunity to possibly start working while I was still in school.
 
DT: How did your education at USC help you in your career?
Ladin:  The teachers at USC provided a great service and an amazing classroom experience. I was able to hone my craft and trim the fat off my work, so to speak, so that once I started to get into the real world I was a lot more prepared than I would have been had I started trying to work professionally right out of high school.
 
DT: What are some of your best memories of college?
Ladin: In terms of acting it was getting to do Grease, the musical, mainly because of the people that were in it. Kelly Ward directed it, and he had been in the movie, so he knew it well, and we had a ball doing it. On the non-acting side of it, one of my best experiences at USC — and I probably can’t get arrested for this now — was when we took a go-kart from a science fair one day, drove it around campus and hid it in a parking garage. Traddies probably contributed to that.
 
DT: What is one piece of advice you want to pass on to current students?
Ladin:  The piece of advice that I got that meant the most to me was to really enjoy all four years and love every moment of it. As an actor, you play so many different roles throughout your career, and the only way to tap into those roles is through the experiences you’ve lived, and so many of those come from my four years at USC. Do as many shows as you can, go to as many parties as you can, meet as many people as you can and steal as many go-karts as you can.

Joe Saltzman, professor of journalism at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, was recently named the national Journalism and Mass Communication Teacher of the Year by the Scripps Howard Foundation.

Saltzman will be honored at the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication convention in St. Louis in August, where he will receive a $10,000 cash prize. Saltzman will also be recognized at the Scripps Howard Foundation’s National Journalism Awards dinner in Cincinnati on May 3.
“It is a great honor, and one that was totally unexpected,” Saltzman said.
Geneva Overholser, director of the School of Journalism, said she nominated Saltzman, who has worked at USC for the last 44 years, because she thought he fit the requirements of the award perfectly.
“It occurred to me as I was reading the description of the award that it had Joe written all over it,” she said. “It not only recognizes career achievement but also looks at teaching, service and research. I thought Joe had just excelled in every one of those areas, and so I thought, ‘Please, please, if there is justice, this will happen.’”
Saltzman is the director of the Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture, a project of the Norman Lear Center at USC Annenberg.
“When I started researching the Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture 25 years ago, no one was much interested in the subject. It wasn’t considered an academic discipline, and few universities offered courses in the subject,” Saltzman said.
Today more than 50 universities are using IJPC materials in their classrooms to study subjects ranging from history to journalism to gender studies. In addition, there are now about 250 IJPC Associates, members who have access to videotapes, CDs, books and other materials in the database and who represent more than 150 academic institutions around the globe.
Many of Saltzman’s previous students attribute their successes in journalism to the knowledge that they’ve gained from him.
Catherine Garcia, who is currently the 4 p.m. weekday news anchor at NBC San Diego, said she still uses what she learned in the classroom with Saltzman today.
“I took Professor Saltzman’s documentary class when I was a senior, and I still use some of the interview techniques and writing tricks that he taught us in my daily work as a journalist,” said Garcia, who graduated from USC in 1995 with a degree in broadcast journalism. “He had a way of turning what seemed like an impossible task, such as writing an entire documentary, into digestible and even enjoyable steps.”
Stephen Randall, the current deputy editor of Playboy and a 1972 graduate of USC, said he even altered his class schedule to ensure having Saltzman as a professor.
“When I was a student at USC, the first thing I learned from the J-school grapevine was that Joe, who then taught a reporting class in the evenings, was the best teacher there,” Randall said. “I actually delayed taking the class to make sure I got him as a teacher, and not some lesser professor. He totally lived up to the hype. I still remember things he taught me and use them.”
Saltzman’s influence has not only reached his students, but has also impacted the development of the Annenberg curriculum both print and broadcast journalism.
“He continues to shape the school powerfully,” Overholser said. “He is heavily involved in curriculum revision and writes syllabi for both his classes and others.”
Saltzman says he plans to donate his $10,000 award to The Jester & Pharley Phund, a non-profit organization that helps children who have cancer and other diseases, as well as creating love for reading among students across the country. The charity is based on the best-selling children’s book The Jester Has Lost His Jingle, which was written and illustrated by Saltzman’s late son, David, who passed away from Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1990.
“It will make this Christmas a very happy time for some children, who need laughter at this time in their lives more than ever,” Saltzman said.
To students who are currently in the Annenberg school, Saltzman says that there is no more exciting time to become a journalist.
“I tell all my students to ignore the doom and gloom that they hear about the future of journalism,” Saltzman said. “For the young, journalism is not only alive and well but also waiting for the next great idea that will transform the journalism of the past into the journalism of the future.”

Stoops Hall, currently the home of the Graduate Education Library, will be the new home of the University Club beginning in spring 2012, the university decided earlier this month.
The University Club is a campus club exclusively for USC faculty and staff, who can choose to become members by applying and paying membership dues. The Club, currently located in a building in the southeast corner of campus, near Pardee Way, is a restaurant for member professors and campus staff.
Stoops Hall is located near the intersection of Trousdale Parkway and 34th Street, west of the School of Social Work.
The decision to move the Club came from the Office of the Provost. Having it in an architecturally historic building was a primary reason cited by staff at the Club.
“[Stoops Hall] is so much more representative of the direction that the university is headed in, in terms of architecture and prestige, and it better represents the history of the university,” said Ed Kasky, program director of the University Club.
Stoops Hall, built in 1923, first served as a branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. It then became part of USC, and has housed the Graduate Education Library and the East Asian Library in 1999.
Stoops Hall is currently being used as additional space for the School of Policy, Planning, and Development. Its current occupants will be moved to the University Gateway building north of campus.
As a former library, Stoops Hall will have to be refitted before the club can move in.
“Stoops will have to be outfitted with a kitchen, and facilities to manage banquets and catering. We’re also making it [American with Disabilities Act] compliant. It’s going to be a serious renovation,” said Kristen Todd, membership and member programs coordinator for the University Club.
Though the interior of the building will have to be significantly changed, little will change on the exterior so as to preserve the building’s historical appearance.
“There are many beautiful components of the original building that [will] still remain and those will be kept in the renovated building,” said Joe Back, associate senior vice president of Campus Development and Facilities Management, in an email.
Club members are also excited about the move to the new building.
“[Stoops Hall] is like Bovard, Doheny and Mudd Hall — it’s in the age and grace of those buildings. It provides a sense of continuity from generation to generation,” said Regina Nordahl, associate dean of the School of Policy, Planning, and Development and University Club member.
Kasky hopes the move will make the club more visible and attract more faculty and staff to become members, which is a goal it constantly strives toward.
The current location will be demolished; details on the replacement structure have not been released, Back said.
A banquet hall and outdoor patio will also be added to Stoops Hall.
“We’re also celebrating our 50th anniversary, so [the move] has come in conjunction with that,” Todd said. “In the fall … we’re looking to do a special dinner or event, kind of a farewell to the old space and the 50 years that were spent here.”
The site of the current single-story building, opened in 1960, could be used more efficiently, according to Kasky.
“[The current structure] being a single-level building, which covers 10,000 square feet, makes it very valuable real estate for the university. So we knew that eventually something multi-story was going to have to come here,” Kasky said.
Other changes to the University Club are planned besides the move. Executive Chef Blake Clevenger recently joined the staff, and the Club will be going through a “brand rehaul,” Todd said.
“The space is going to have a lot more of a collegial club feel, as has been seen in other university clubs throughout the country,” he said.
Funding for the renovation of Stoops Hall will come jointly from the University Club and the university, according to Kasky. Construction will start April 18, and the renovation is planned to be completed by Feb. 2, 2012.

The Internet has gone beyond social interactions and played an important role in several recent political uprisings in the Middle East, according to Gelare Khoshgozaran of Iran, a graduate student studying fine arts, who participated in a panel held Thursday.
The Office of International Services hosted a discussion with four students from Egypt, Iran and Jordan in Doheny Memorial Library to discuss the social and political impact of the recent events in Egypt and the Middle East.
The panel discussion was the latest in a series of events by the Office of International Services known as “State of the World” seminars, which have been ongoing since 1989. The seminars aim to give international students at USC the opportunity to share their unique perspectives on world events.
About 30 people attended Thursday’s event, where student panelists shared their ideas and experiences regarding the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt and discussed how the uprisings have affected events in surrounding countries.
“The Tunisian revolution was definitely a catalyst in the Egyptian uprising, but there were many other things that happened in the past 10 years that were actually introductions to these uprisings,” said Mohamed Saleh, a doctoral student from Egypt studying economics.
One of the central themes of the discussion was this series of revolutions in the Middle East following the initial uprising in Tunisia in January and the Internet’s role in these events.
Saleh described the growth of social media as integral to the events that led up to the end of Mubarak’s regime. He said some of the largest stepping stones to the revolution, such as a countrywide strike in 2008, were coordinated through media like Facebook.
Muhannad Al Salayta of Jordan, a doctoral student studying dentistry, said a new group of protestors known as the Youth of March 24 Movement is starting to embrace digital media and the Internet by setting up a live streaming camera.
“It seems to be a very good tactic,” Al Salayta said. “Cyber media plays a very big role in Jordan. Almost everyone uses Facebook. It really changes the way people aggregate and organize.”
Khoshgozaran said the Internet allows people to live in ways that aren’t possible under their culturally oppressive and conservative society.
“The virtual space becomes this platform for us to use as a substitute for whatever was lacking in the society on the streets,” Khoshgozaran said. “When it came to political activism, it was there and it affected the way that we thought about our society outside of the Internet.”
The panelists also acknowledged the ways social media have connected people to current events by eliminating the middle man in news distribution.
“Normally the news and information gets filtered, and sometimes you look at the news of an event and it’s so alienated,” Khoshgozaran said. “But when I’m an individual and take a picture of the protests on the street of Tehran and immediately upload it to Facebook, it’s nothing professional, but it is more real.”
Mohamed El Sheikh of Egypt, a graduate student studying building science in the School of Architecture, said in the past intimidation was a useful tactic for the government. Now, he said, intimidation only makes the protestors stronger and more passionate.
“This time, everyone had the same grief and sadness inside them,” El Sheikh said. “We were better able to organize and form a very strong group opposing the regime.”
Daily Trojan,
I am always surprised at DT reporting (though after a couple of years of disappointment I shouldn’t)… The main discussion was the state of events and what the people need at this time, and why the revolutions occurred… In other words, what is happening in the Middle East- certainly NOT a facebook argument!!! Did you even listen to what they were saying? These were wonderful students expressing how their people felt at such historical events, and you make it sound like social media?

His solo career might be going extremely well, but Travie McCoy hasn’t forgotten where he came from.
Remember that alternative hip-hop group called Gym Class Heroes that was always on the radio in 2007 with their hit single “Cupid’s Chokehold” from their 2005 album, The Paper Chronicles? Yeah, they haven’t gone anywhere.
Before McCoy, the frontman of GCH, worked on his solo career, the band released two successful albums after The Paper. Now they are getting ready to record their fourth studio album, said to be named The Paper Chronicles 2, hopefully this summer.
“The new record — hence the name — is a throwback to our first record and just trying to capture the innocence that that record had,” McCoy told MTV News.
So far, the band has about 25 demos and the number is growing. When the time comes, they’ll have to choose which ones are worthy of landing a spot on the new album.
Rumors have been going around that this Friday, GCH will be announced as one of the acts for the Vans Warped Tour’s main stage. Check the official Warped Tour website this Friday to see if the rumors are true

Back in 2001, a strange storm of rock revivalism swept the international music sphere. Before the thundering advancement of Alicia Keys, Eminem and even Crazy Town, this short-lived movement took a stab at injecting some adrenaline into the flaccid veins of rock and roll and saw an alarming advance of “The” bands: The Hives, The White Stripes, The Vines and most sacred of all, The Strokes.
Cubism · Angles comes across as boring as The Strokes repeat shabby trademarks such as their abused cynicism and stale musical efforts. - Photo courtesy of Big Hassle  
Prophetically dubbed the savior of garage rock before its first album had even been released, The Strokes seemed doomed for an unseemly end. Indeed, despite the layered bento box of crooning self-hatred and popcorn guitar riffs found on Is This It and its worthy followup Room on Fire, the New York City quintet carried the burden of impossibly high expectations, eventually buckling in 2006 with the harebrained First Impressions of Earth.
Met with scathing reviews and nursing already fractured band relations, the boys threw in the towel.
Now, after four rather squeamishly received solo efforts, The Strokes has ill-advisedly reunited for the sake of a fat paycheck and is back on the market with its long-awaited fourth studio album, Angles.
One thing is certain. Front man Julian Casablancas is no longer pulling the strings.
The best thing to be said about the first Strokes record in five years is it has an unexpectedly rich caché of sounds and textures.
“Machu Picchu” begins with a warbling guitar loop somewhere between Modest Mouse and Men at Work.
The snarling, tinny chords of “You’re So Right” filter through one of Kraftwerk’s older synth modules. Even the reverb-coated drums of “Two Kinds of Happiness” recall the same unlikely adaptation of pop aesthetics that Iggy Pop achieved with “Real Wild Child.”
Unfortunately, once Casablancas opens his mouth, the party’s over. The same cigarette-scarred angst is there, but whereas Casablancas seemed to celebrate his own disaffection on previous efforts, here the sky has darkened.
I know, everyone goes any damn place they like, he laments on “Taken For A Fool” adding, I hope this goes over well, on the toxic radio / Yeah.
Consider that final ‘yeah.’ Cynicism has always been the language of The Strokes, but does it stay fresh after more than a decade of existence?
When “The Modern Age” made its radio debut, Casablancas’  emotionally eremitic persona stood as an acknowledgment of those disheartened by the corporate takeover and manufacturing of pop and rock trends.
Yet that’s exactly what has happened to The Strokes — and Casablancas seems all too aware of it, his sardonic side now misanthropic and ugly.
Unsurprisingly, Angles is the sound of five grown men burying their contempt for themselves —and each other — under layers of fuzz and echoes.
The only song here that feels imbued with something more cathartic than cash is “Under Cover of Darkness,” a guitar-centric throwdown that sounds closest to The Strokes’ earlier, more innocent days.
Even Casablancas seems more alive here, intoning It’s a nightmare / So I’m joining the army, and then vulnerably asking, Will you wait for me?
Had more of the album harnessed such gallows joy, Angles would have likely been an acceptable return from a band whose place in music history still seems a mystery.
There’s no doubt The Strokes’ sound was always fun, but now, with a bountiful garden of independent acts incomparable to anything thought possible 10 years ago, do we still need the band?
The Strokes is currently slated to headline this year’s Coachella festival, but when the hour comes for its members’ entrance, the masses might yet be found at Death From Above 1979’s set, or even in the Sahara Tent for Swedish House Mafia’s Axwell.
Sadly, The Strokes seems to have had the right idea when it put its instruments in the closet in 2006. Like any industry dinosaurs, dusted off and carted out for a latter day appearance, Casablancas and Co. will likely make their expected millions from this new effort, play at the expected summer festivals and maybe even snag a Grammy nomination or two.
But it’s unlikely anyone will care, because Angles, simply put, is a serious drag.

Books, more than any other medium, seem to be embracing the digital revolution.
But even more so than prose novels, the comic book industry is looking to move beyond its traditional format.
Whereas e-readers like the Kindle or Nook really just transcribe the pages to a screen, comic book writers are finding new ways to tell their stories and attract new readers.
Direct market comic book sales suffered a 5 percent drop in 2010, despite the releases of major films like Iron Man 2 and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.
Though people will pay up to $20 to see Tony Stark kick butt on the big screen, they don’t seem to be going out of their way to pick up his monthly adventures at a comic book store for a fraction of that cost.
The drop in direct comic book sales could be the sign of a need to shift toward digital comics that use the Kindle or Nook.
Jonathan Hickman, writer of Marvel Comics’ S.H.I.E.L.D. and The Fantastic Four, doubts the digital market is having much of an impact comic books now, but sees a lot of potential in the future.
“We got to get our digital shit together. We haven’t yet, we’re very poor in that area, just because we’re in the beginning,” he said. “Nobody gets it right. Once we get that started, we won’t have the distribution choke that we have right now in the direct market. Things will get more interesting. I don’t see any way we don’t expand in the next 10 years.”
Becoming more digital would benefit both the comics industry and digital platforms like the burgeoning tablet market. Comics get a wider audience and the platforms get more content.
After all, there’s an amazingly large back catalogue of each ongoing comic, not to mention comic book production is cheaper and faster than that of television shows or movies.
Why wait a year for the next season of less than a dozen episodes of AMC’s television version of The Walking Dead when there are more than 80 issues ready to be read?
“I can write what is essentially a $350 million movie as a comic. I can add all of [the special effects] I want and all someone has to do is draw that,” Hickman said. “As a delivery device for narrative, comics are fantastic.”
But Nick Spencer, creator of Morning Glories and The Infinite Vacation, sees more creative opportunities beyond just putting comics on the screen. To him, the digital medium attracts new readers, but also allow for the creators themselves to try new things.
“The big things that are coming are purely digital and aren’t confined to the traditional structure of printed comics. There’s no reason why they need to look or feel that way,” he said. “The big innovations in the next decade will be meaty in that, re-exploring the medium of sequential storytelling without page boundaries. That’s the stuff I’m excited to see.”
And with that re-exploration, he sees artists taking a greater role in creating comics, and really taking advantage of what new media offer them.
“They’ll have an inherent advantage, because they think visually,” Spencer said. “I think you’ll see a big power shift as this develops. [The comic book] industry for last 10 years [has been] heavily dominated by writers.”
But it’s not just digital comics that offer opportunities. Scott Snyder, writer of Detective Comics and American Vampire, sees transmedia as the future of comics and a source of innovation.
“I think [writers are] always obsessed with the tech of [contemporary culture]. More from a readership standpoint, it’s exciting,” Snyder said. “There are all kinds of possibilities with digital comics.”
Transmedia, or telling the story across multiple platforms — how shows like Lost spread their mythology across webisodes, alternate reality games and books — allows for not only the broader artistic canvas that Spencer suggests, but also for writers to experiment with telling stories in ways they haven’t before.
“Soon you’ll be able to download elements to a story that are only able to be seen because of iPad, iPhone, Droid, etc.,” Snyder said. “It will be an experience that’s much more nuanced story-wise.”
The writers don’t fear the coming shakeup. If anything, they are excited about it.
“I hope [to be at forefront of it]. I think writers that will succeed are writers that are willing to adapt, willing to change,” Spencer said. “If you want to come in and do five panels, and add your captions and dialogue, it’s going to be a rough decade for you. If you’re willing to get with an audience and say ‘How do we break loose?’ then this will be a great time to be writing.”

If you want to hear the thoughts of people who are on the leading edge of this trend, listen to the Webcomics Weekly podcast, which features a number of comics artists who have been leading the way. They interviewed Skottie Young in one of their most recent episodes.
The best part about this revolution is, as Hickman pointed out, doing away with the distribution beast.  Instead of having to wrangle with Diamond in order to get your books stocked in obscure specialty stores – with trade paperbacks from the big companies in chain bookstores at best – anyone with the gumption can publish their own comic online, accessible to all, provided you can get people’s attention.  It changes the landscape from plutocracy to meritocracy.  Or, at least, it moves us a lot closer to that.
Great article. As an independent creator I’m excited to jump on the digital band wagon.

Ten food trucks will congregate on The Row from 3 to 9 p.m. tonight for Food Truck Wars, a philanthropic event organized by The Dish Dash Los Angeles, the USC Interfraternity Council and the USC Panhellenic Council.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
The event pits East against West on two sides of The Row. Each of the food trucks will offer a Trojan-themed “secret menu,” accessible to those who sign up to The Dish Dash online. Twenty percent of the proceeds from the event will go to Downtown non-profit organizations Paws/LA and The Union Rescue Mission.
Here’s a guide to tonight’s Food Truck Wars to help you choose a side.
 
1. Mighty Boba Truck: Fresh-brewed sweet tea beverages that will silence any complaints about the lack of good boba in America.
This Taiwanese snack truck never sells drinks more than four hours old, and the iconic tapioca balls that come with it are perfectly chewy and springy.
Options for tea flavors are limited, which means you should try the original milk tea with little hesitation. Sip it down with some of their Taiwanese snack favorites like sweet pork sausage and thick butter toast.
 
Secret menu item: Strawberry milk tea with golden boba — Red tea with golden yellow tapioca pearls
 
2.  Papa’s Tapas: Spanish appetizers that are petite in size, but big in flavor.
The croquetas are a must-try. They are deep-fried carb-balls with  crunchy shella and  creamy, mashed potato-like interiors. Even the simple salads are elevated to fresh, flavorful elegance.
 
Secret menu item: Tortilla Española — With roasted red pepper aioli and spicy sofrita
 
3. Frysmith: All the fantastical combinations fit to top America’s favorite vegetable.
Since everybody has their own unconventional ways of eating fries, why not just go crazy? Dare to give the Kimchi fries a try. Apart from the spicy Korean pickled cabbage, the fries also come smothered under rich Kurobuta pork belly, onions and melted cheddar cheese.
You can also get sweet potato fries for a more complex, sweet and savory profile.
 
Secret menu item: “Trojan Cardinal Prosciutto Pizza Fries”— Features prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce
 
4. Lardon: A truck with a bacon fetish. What’s not to like?
Lardon offers dishes with basic concepts like a bacon-and-egg sandwich and the BLT sandwich, but adds its own twist such as using toasted baguette and adding blue cheese for the BLT and of course, always using thick, high-quality bacon.
But their desserts are the showstoppers. Brownie with bacon-nutella frosting, anyone?
 
Secret menu item: “The Row”— Three pieces of bacon stacked and layered, with melted, shredded cheddar cheese inside
 
5. José O’Malley’s: A blend of classic American and Mexican cuisines with a healthy dose of Irish flair.
It’s hard to miss this truck with its circus colors and the blown-up image of a redhead chomping on a taco.
Run by two sisters, José O’Malley’s determined to be the most physically-flamboyant truck, but its menu keeps it tame with ultimate comfort food like Chicago hot dogs, loaded mashed potatoes and Americanized tacos.
 
Secret menu item: “Trojan Feast” — Nachos with your choice of Beast Red Chips, beans, meat, golden cheese, more chips, meat, and cheese topped with pico de gallo, hot peppers and sour cream
 
6. White Rabbit Truck: Filipino favorites with a Mexican twist and the American love for gorging.
To order, you choose the meat, then the carbs, which include a choice of tacos, burrito, rice bowl or fries.
For the meat, you cannot go wrong with pork. The customer favorite is the pork sisig, which is a crispy blend of fried pork belly, spiced up with onions and jalapenos for fatty, salty and crunchy bliss.
 
Secret menu item: Red Velvet Macaroons — This is self-explanatory: must eat!
 
7. Kabob N’ Roll: Healthy, home-cooked Mediterranean fare.
Nothing too surprising here: beef, chicken or lamb gyro or pita sandwiches some falafel and hummus and dolmas and baklava.
But it’s probably the healthiest and most vegan-friendly truck out of the bunch, and you can count on the ingredients to be fresh and wholesome. It’s like being welcomed into a Mediterranean home.
 
Secret menu item: “Trojan” Fries — Fresh hand-cut fries topped with homemade hummus, tomatoes, and feta cheese
 
8. Slammin’ Sliders: Upscale cuisine that won’t break your bank. Or your parents’ bank.
Of course, you’ve got to order sliders at a truck called Slammin’ Sliders, which dishes up Hawaiian rolls stuffed with luxury proteins like Kobe beef and pink pepper-crusted lobster.
But make room for the Okinawa potato salad as well, which is a lovely mash of purple sweet potatoes. Another worthy sweet potato dish is the crisp and gooey sweet potato croquette with pepperjack cheese.
 
Secret menu item: “USC” Triple Play ­— Three Kobe beef sliders with a “U”nique “S”auce “C”heddar, which is a blend of Cardinal (sauce) and Gold (cheddar)
 
9. DIMSUM Truck: Traditional and non-traditional Cantonese morsels at a cheaper price. Who says dim sum is only for brunch?
Ask for the pork and shrimp shumai, which comes with a sticky, garlicky sauce, or the chicken and mushroom buns. If you want something more innovative, the Peking duck taco is also a delicious option.
 
Secret menu item: BBQ pork puff pastries — Sweet (red) char-siu BBQ pork inside a baked (golden) puff pastry crust
 
10. Chunk-n-Chip: Artisan ice cream sandwiched between warm chewy cookies.
Choose from classic ice cream flavors like strawberry and rocky road, and cookies like chocolate chip and red velvet. You can even get two different ice creams and two kinds of cookies if you want.
 
Secret menu item: “The Mammoth” — three-cookie/two-ice cream scoop BOO-Yah sandwich: chocolate brownie cookie, peanut butter cup ice cream, red velvet cookie, peanut butter cup ice cream and chocolate brownie cookie, with whipped cream and chocolate swirls between the cookies.

Facebook has established itself as a leading presence in all facets of life. Mark Zuckerberg was named TIME’s Person of the Year, there was hot debate over Facebook going public, The Social Network was a huge success and the website has played a revolutionary role in the recent uprisings in the Middle East.
Still, the website is facing identity issues. Facebook is many things for many people. But what is Facebook to Facebook itself?
The number of newspaper articles and blog posts and the amount of general conversation about Facebook’s role in recent historic moments is enormous. The website has fueled protests, mobilized citizens, helped overthrow dictatorships and helped spread democracy.
Amid these movements, the website has tenaciously stuck to a policy requiring users to sign up with their real identities as a protection against fraud. It also doubles as self-protection against costly lawsuits and other troublesome user issues.
In November, Facebook shut down one of its most popular Egyptian protest pages because one of the page administrators, Google executive Wael Ghonim, had created a profile under a fake name. Was Facebook protecting Ghonim? Maybe. But whether it was acting in his best interests or the company’s is unclear.
It’s important to recognize that from Facebook’s perspective, the site is running a worldwide business that needs consistent protection and regulation to successfully operate.
Facebook can — and does — have a positive impact on the world, both as a casual social networking website and as a catalyst for democratic change.
But whether you’re an American college student or an Iranian activist (or both), it’s crucial to understand the tension between the vision of Facebook as a platform for political and social change and the company as a business.
With the exponentially increasing importance of all things online, the challenge for Facebook is to find a way to reconcile its two conflicting identities.

this is one of the most retarded articles i have ever read. it has no point
Seriously, this is utterly retarded. it makes no sense at all. (though dude, I believe the politically-correct term is “challenged”)
“Retarded” is definitely more apt.
Indeed, Facebook is many things to many people. I happend to believe there’s two kind of people in our society: those with FB and those without. I canceled my FB in Feb. of 2010. Life without Facebook over the past year has been great. I’m no longer in dismay over people’s lack of anonymity about certain things that should remain private. The list goes on, but I’m proud to be one of the few people without FB.

The ongoing crisis in Libya presents a fascinating foreign policy dilemma for the Obama administration.
President Barack Obama’s victory in the 2008 presidential election was largely spurred by a public that was fed up with George W. Bush’s handling of foreign affairs. Bush, it seems, had squandered the United States’ position as a dominant superpower by wasting our physical and intangible resources on two ongoing and seemingly unwinnable wars.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
A problem many Americans had with Bush’s foreign policy was its overly ideological nature.
All policymakers must frequently choose between ideology and pragmatism, and the debate is never more significant than when deciding what is worth sending American troops to fight for.
So many factors enter into that calculation — the number of foreign lives at stake, the chances of success, the geopolitical importance of the region, the consequences of failure — that all presidents must decide how they balance pragmatism with ideology to know when it is “worth it” to wage a military campaign.
In 2008, Obama promised to make American foreign policy more pragmatic. Obama’s victory represented a new era of practicality in Washington as the dogmatic neoconservatives were swept out of office and back to their think tanks.
Obama never pretended to be a Machiavellian realist, however, leaving morality entirely out of the foreign policy agenda. Instead, it seemed he would try to find a better balance between using American power as a force for good — however that is defined — and maintaining and growing that power by avoiding overextension.
This philosophy represents the most judicious use of American power, and it is to be commended.
It has its downsides, however. It leaves the president open to valid criticism from both sides, and it can also lead to “mission creep” as our goals, priorities and limits are not explicitly defined, but rather are context-dependent and continually evolving.
Libyan Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi’s brutal suppression of the protest-cum-rebel movement in his country has furnished the most difficult test yet for the Obama style of foreign policy.
On one hand, getting involved has little obvious strategic benefit to the United States.
Libya is an oil exporter, but supplies were steady under Colonel Qaddafi and there is no reason to believe helping a rebel movement against him will increase American energy security. A military campaign risks American lives, puts our reputation at risk yet again and costs money that we do not have. Jon Stewart summed up this view best when he quipped that we shouldn’t be firing teachers and tomahawk missiles at the same time.
On the other hand, there is a strong moral argument for getting involved. The Libyan people are now at the mercy of an apparently insane dictator who is willing to bomb civilian targets in his own cities far more urgently and obviously than Iraq in 2003 or Afghanistan in 2001.
Under Bush, getting involved would not have even been a debate. His ideological foreign policy agenda would have embraced the Libyan campaign more than any other, as it represents a perfect maelstrom of dictatorial overreach, genocidal threat and terrorist links.
For Obama, however, the choice is more difficult. He needs to decide how he will balance ideology and pragmatism.
In this context, Obama’s March 18 speech outlining our mission in Libya and reasons for being there was impressive. He clearly explained why the United States had to become involved, why military action was a last resort and what our role will be within an international coalition.
Most importantly, he committed to keeping troops off the ground and keeping the use of force limited to the protection of Libyan civilians.
Since then, however, the military’s actions in Libya have exposed Obama’s conflicting policies. We bombarded targets in various cities and lost a fighter jet. Republicans in Washington seized the opportunity to criticize Obama’s apparent flip-flop and ironically are warning about another Iraq.
That might not be realistic, but the Republicans are right to call out Obama as the United States drifts toward the ideological side of the spectrum. The key to maintaining a balanced foreign policy is articulating a clearly defined line that will not be crossed.
In the past few days, we have crept ever-closer to that line. Hopefully, we will stop before we cross it.

He led us into war without consulting us. He didn’t even return to US soil before launching an attack on third font. He said he would end foreign wars during the presidential campaign. When will our troops have a rest and come home? 
We are already using 40% of our federal budget on interest payments. The first day of attacks used more than $100,000,000 in missiles alone. We don’t have the money for another war. We won’t get that money back from trade with Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya.

Maryland pop-punk band Good Charlotte’s new single is taking fans in a time capsule back to the 90s. The song, which is entitled “Last Night,” is a catchy offering that sees singer Joel Madden trying to understand the wild events that occurred during the previous evening.
Consequently, when Good Charlotte announced that this track would be the next single from their November 2010 album Cardiology, fans expected a music video depicting a person flashing back to the debauchery he must have taken part in before he went to sleep.
In a sense, the video does depict debauchery, but the twist is that the blurry memories from the night before actually have to do with the Nickelodeon game show Family Double Dare.
There is no alcohol, no promiscuous dancing and no hangovers. Instead, viewers find two families (one of which consists of the members of the band) with cheesy team names competing on the game show hosted by the actual host Marc Summers. There are pies, slime, balloon pants, hot dogs, slides, the big nose that competitors have to reach up to find their flags and the characteristically ridiculous haircuts signature of the ’90s era.
The popular show ran on Nickelodeon from 1990 until 1993, with repeats running on the network throughout the rest of the decade. The video, then, is full of nostalgia and signifies the second consecutive time that Good Charlotte has wavered off the path of traditional music videos.
Their previous single’s video (for the song “Sex on the Radio”) featured the band members walking around the streets of Los Angeles with headphones asking people what they thought of the song.
Good Charlotte is currently on tour in support of the new release and will be coming to Hollywood, Califor. on March 26 and Anaheim, Calif. on March 27.
