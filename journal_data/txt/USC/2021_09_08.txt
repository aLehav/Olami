During Tuesday’s Senate meeting, the Undergraduate Student Government discussed upcoming assembly and committee social events, including a service festival and a voter registration event, and confirmed their new advocacy liaisons.
At the beginning of the meeting, Chief Programming Officer Jessica Minsol Kim introduced efforts to keep USG’s in-person events compliant with coronavirus policy. 
“A lot of our students are looking for any ways to get involved, so our events are always over capacity,” Kim said. “Not a lot of our events have contributed to spreading [the coronavirus], so we are going to just go ahead and do as [much] outdoor programming as possible.”
During her presentation, Kim announced the Black Student Assembly’s new SCiblings mentorship program for the 2021-2022 school year. Any incoming Black freshmen, transfer students or spring admits who have spent less than two semesters at USC are able to apply to be paired with a “Big SCibling.” 
Kim also discussed the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s plans to co-host a mixer with the International Student Assembly next Tuesday. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Kim said she and the other members of APASA hope to continue to use their platform to provide a “healing experience” to Asian and Pacific Islander students coming onto campus in the wake of rising anti-Asian hate crimes that took place throughout the past year. 
“Our whole assembly was definitely grieving for the good part of the year, but it was the most fortunate of the unfortunate situations because we had each other to talk about these things with,” Kim said. “We raised so much money. We connected with so many organizations in [Los Angeles] that are doing things to combat these hate crimes. We posted so many things to help. It was a very heavy semester, but I couldn’t have been more glad that I got the chance to do something, because if I didn’t do all these things, I would just be sad.” 
Sens. Nivea Krishnan and Hunter Hinson also spoke to the Daily Trojan about their plans to create a more welcoming environment for new students on campus. Krishnan and Hinson both sit on USG’s Committee on Affordability and Basic Needs and are currently working with the USC Bookstore and the Student Basic Needs department to launch a textbook aid program for students in need. 
Hinson said he was inspired to work on the project because he experienced difficulties affording textbooks when he first attended USC. 
“[The pandemic] was really hard for my family,” said Hinson, who is a Federal Pell Grant recipient. “I just remember freshman year, having a professor who wrote the textbook himself … and was forcing us to spend $120 each to buy his own textbook, and that seemed like a conflict of interest in a sense, and also a huge chunk of money out of our own wallets that could be used on things like food or clothing or housing. If you can’t afford it, that shouldn’t be something that sets you back, apart from your peers.” 
In addition to working with Hinson on the Affordability and Basic Needs Committee, Krishnan also serves on USG’s COVID-19 and Return to Campus Taskforce. Currently, Krishnan is working to “make student hybrid accommodations in classrooms accessible” and figuring out how to train teachers and teaching assistants. 
“[Teachers and TAs] don’t like waiting for ITS to come and help them with everything, so that’s the main project,” Krishnan said. “I’m trying to get in contact with people at ITS to try and go through them to see if that type of training is feasible and [if] we’re able to construct that.” 
The Senate also unanimously confirmed the nine advocacy liaisons, a brand new position within USG who represents various assemblies within the organization’s new advocacy department. 
“The purpose of advocacy liaisons is to make sure that the type of advocacy and activism that happens outside of USG and within these multicultural assemblies and identity-based assemblies is being heard and represented … in all the legislative and advocacy work USG does,” Chief Diversity Officer Kavita Rai said. “It really is to give a voice to the assemblies and make sure that we really are meeting community needs by having them actively participate in that conversation as it relates to all of our USG advocacy work.”
USG is currently working with the Pacific Islander Student Association, IDEAS at USC, the Environmental Student Assembly and the Native American Student Assembly to recruit four students for available advocacy liaison positions by the end of September.

Despite USC’s fall on-campus activities resuming to near normalcy, the surge in coronavirus infections in Los Angeles County, induced primarily by the highly-infectious Delta variant, remains high. Amid increased governmental guidelines and restrictions, such as the reimplementation of indoor mask mandates across the county on July 17, the University outlined its contingency plans if there were to be a rapid rise of campus cases.
During a student media briefing on Aug. 26, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman identified hospitalization rates as the key indicator in driving decisions about restrictive measures on campus.
Van Orman said that the most likely response to coronavirus outbreaks on campus would involve localized responses in certain areas and populations on campus, rather than shutting down in-person classes.
Though Van Orman said that the possibility of a full-scale lockdown is very unlikely and would have to be prompted by a particularly severe situation within the University, she noted that isolating certain groups in the event of a rise in cases remains an option.
“It is possible a student could be involved in [a situation where] a dorm is locked down, a class is locked down, a cohort is locked down,” Van Orman said. “So I don’t want people to minimize what could happen.”
In a Sept. 2 student media briefing, Van Orman said that the University has plans to increase quarantine space if positive cases rise in the USC community.
“We have a contingency plan to clear up the rest of the USC hotel,” Van Orman said. “And we also have the space at a downtown hotel, if needed, so we have that on reserve, but we absolutely have a plan to go up to 600 [spaces] if needed.” 
The continued uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic and the potential of worsening conditions has challenged all students, especially those whose families do not reside in the United States. 
Since March 2020, many international students have navigated complicated VISA processes, struggled to learn in different time zones and spent large periods of time away from their homes.
Josh Pan came to USC this fall excited for a traditional, in-person college experience. Now, with L.A. County Public Health reporting daily case counts nearing 3,000, required masking and weekly testing, that confidence seems to be threatened. 
Pan, a freshman from Croatia majoring in international relations, said he plans to stay on campus if the pandemic worsens and has hopes for how the University will support international students if online learning is reinstated.
“For those who cannot attend class in person, [it would be helpful] to have lectures that accommodate different time zones,” Pan said. “For example, having two lectures for one class for students in a timezone, say, in the Americas, and another one for Asia or Europe.”
Leslie Jia, a freshman majoring in international relations, global business, is in a similar position. Because of  the strict quarantine policy in his home country of China, he would have to wait until the end of the spring semester to return home if his cohort or dorm is placed on lockdown. 
“I hope that the University will just keep dorms open and allow us to live and study in dorms,” Jia said. “Us international students, we cannot just find a place to live.”
As for the University’s role in helping students readjust to life on campus, Jia said that while he is enjoying in-person classes this fall, he would like to see a limit to the on-campus events that encourage large gatherings of people, such as concerts and movie nights.
When it comes to these large, outdoor gatherings organized by the University, Van Orman said USC’s goal is to align events held on campus with the decisions of the surrounding community, attempting to balance the risks of gatherings with the desire for a sense of normalcy.
“We have a really closely packed student population, where people can work, people can spread [the coronavirus],” Van Orman said. “I think that’s the tension we’re all facing.”
Nick Charles Currie, a junior majoring in journalism who commutes to campus, said a pivot to partially or fully remote learning would not be a large adjustment for him. However, he said that being a commuter student has social disadvantages that might be worsened if remote learning is reinstated.
“[I hope the University will] find a way to make breakout rooms more common and get more human interaction through Zoom because that was something I was greatly lacking [during the last period of remote learning],” Currie said.
Brianna Tang, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she would like to see USC’s vibrant, on-campus student life maintained in the case of a shift to a partially virtual environment. For now, she said she is content with the efforts the University has made to ensure a safe return to campus and that she has felt supported by staff and her peers in adjusting to in-person learning.
“I think [the University has] done a pretty good job in this transition from the virtual learning setting throughout the last 18 months into on-campus and in-person, like how we’ve been doing the daily Trojan Checks and the weekly [coronavirus] testing,” Tang said.
However, if classes do return to a virtual format, Tang said she hopes the University will organize safe ways to interact with other students and faculty.
“I still want to feel like a part of the Trojan family, as we all do,” Tang said.

If there was ever a movie to leave you completely exhausted after sitting in a reclining lounge chair for two hours, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” would be it. Holding true to the superhero genre, “Shang-Chi” has plenty of action to go around, including several 10-minute fight sequences and a monster-versus-monster finale that puts “Godzilla vs. Kong” to shame. 
While the CGI artists are hard at work behind the scenes, actor Simu Liu (who plays titular character Shang-Chi) puts on the performance of a lifetime on screen. Previously known for playing Jung, the estranged son in Canadian comedy “Kim’s Convenience,” Liu sheds his sitcom past to take up the role of serious superhero hunk in thrilling fashion.
Liu’s goofy counterpart Katy, played by the ever-comical Awkwafina, provides the comedic relief that this film often desperately needs at points where the action seems to overtake the storyline, as well as the classic “oh-my-god-you’re-a-superhero” jaw drops that every Marvel movie requires.
After years in pre-production, director Destin Daniel Cretton (“Just Mercy”) had a big task on his hands with bringing the first Asian American-led Marvel movie to life. It was important not to reduce Shang-Chi’s character to a one dimensional kung-fu master (as many poor attempts at Asian American representation have done before) but instead try to incorporate various aspects of Chinese culture and traditions without reverting to stereotypes, Cretton said. This was done successfully by forgoing the typical East-versus-West narrative that older versions of the “Shang-Chi” comics had focused on and, instead, creating a more intimate son-and-father conflict. 
“Shang-Chi” concentrates on humanizing and providing a background to its hero more than most Marvel movies. We learn about Shang-Chi’s (or Shaun, his painfully similar American name) backstory through the abundant use of flashbacks and are given ample time to sympathize with him and his struggles. Even the antagonist of this film, Mandarin (Tony Leung), Shang-Chi’s father, is a morally complicated character that viewers are given plenty of reason to comprehend. 
One of the most fascinating aspects of this film is its incorporation of martial arts, despite not being an entirely martial arts-focused movie. Michelle Yeoh, whom some viewers might recognize from “Crazy Rich Asians,” quickly becomes one of the most endearing characters as she teaches our young hero how to channel the power of nature into his fighting.
The movie works best when it’s contained to a simple family drama, but the story starts to wander when it shifts into a battle for humanity between thousands of miniature flying soul-suckers and an antsy prehistoric dragon. Yes, the CGI work is incredible, and yes, there is an epic fight scene, but once we understand the good-versus-evil monster situation, the plot takes a turn for the predictable.
As one of the first movies in the MCU’s new Phase 4, viewers get a glimpse into what the Marvel universe will look like after the “Infinity Saga.” We are introduced to one of its newest superheroes, and it’s a welcome sight to see Marvel making an effort to add more diversity to its roster, especially with the release of “Eternals” in two months, which is being hailed by fans and critics alike as the most inclusive Marvel film yet.
While “Shang-Chi” is a win for representation after a year of strain for the Asian American community following an increase of Sinophobia and hate crimes, it should not be reduced to or simply known for being the first Asian American-led superhero movie. It is a genuinely impressive and pioneering movie in the sense that it has more layers than a large number of prior Marvel releases. 
While perhaps a tad overdone in its attempted scale, it’s the individual personalities that elevate this movie. It’s not the attempted soul-sucking of a colossal lake-dwelling dragon that wins the audience over; it’s the playful banter between Katy and Shaun as they argue over who gets to valet a BMW.
Watch out Avengers, there’s a new kid in town.

As billboards popped up unexpectedly across the country, it meant one thing: Drake was finally back. 
“Certified Lover Boy,” his first studio album since the release of “Scorpion” in 2018, comes at a time when he’s still one of the hottest names in the music industry. With this album, Drake addresses his beef with Kanye West, delivers hits that get stuck in your head and fires back at rappers envious of his success. 
“Certified Lover Boy,” CLB to fans, is a great success. It’s an album powerful enough to satisfy his die-hard fan base and one that further cements his status in hip-hop. 
CLB has everything you’d expect from a Drake album — catchy lyrics like “I’ve been losin’ friends and findin’ peace / But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me,” and emotional woes like “So much s*** I wanted to say, straight to your face / But you’re so two-faced, that I don’t know which face.” There are focused tracks like “No Friends In The Industry,” that highlight Drake’s unique rapping on rapid beats and chart-toppers like “Way 2 Sexy,” that highlight Drake’s ability to turn bizarre songs into ones that will live in your head. At the end of the album, listeners know that Drake can still hold his own, even if naysayers claim he’s past his prime.  
From the opening track, “Champagne Poetry,” we get a bubbly beat reminiscent of Drake’s memorable intros to his older studio albums. It’s no “Over My Dead Body” or “Tuscan Leather,” but it gets the job done. It sets the tone for the album — Drake reflecting while praising himself. It’s clear from the first bar of the album: “I been hot since the birth of my son / I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done.”
By the time you reach the sixth song on the album, it’s obvious Drake is determined to quiet his haters. At age 34 though, being locked in doesn’t mean it’s his best work. 
Many tracks, even in Drake terms, were forgettable. “Girls Want Girls” with Lil Baby is an example of an opportunity lost — even with its truly catchy chorus and trademark Drake verse. “In The Bible” with Lil Durk and Giveon is a poorly constructed track with a short 40-second verse from Lil Durk and a majority of the beat wasted with more short verses. “Race My Mind,” “F****** Fans” and “Get Along Better” with Ty Dolla $ign seem out of place and incomplete in overall production. 
One can argue “Love All” with Jay-Z is the best song on the album, especially with the “Life After Death” intro and simple percussion behind the beat. Drake’s reflective “People never care ‘til it’s R.I.P.,” chorus is an observation on the culture of rappers. He implies many in the rap game tear each other down, then celebrate one another when they pass away. It could be Drake anticipating fellow rappers appreciating him more once he’s gone  after disrespecting him now. 
After “Yebba’s Heartbreak,” CLB shifts from slow melodic somber songs to fast-flowing verses. Drake continues the trend of dismissing his haters. One of the highlights of the second half  of the album is the three-song rotation of “No Friends In The Industry,” “Knife Talk” and “7am On Bridle Path.” They prove that Drake’s wordplay and rapping are still legendary. 
The Lil Wayne and Rick Ross collaboration on “You Only Live Twice” is a phenomenal track with glowing verses from each artist. The bouncy beat plus the speed of the vocals and track are reminiscent of a fast drive on the highway. 
Most memorable, though, is how the feud with rap mogul Kanye West advanced on “7AM On Bridle Path,” with specific shots taken at West. 
In the build-up to his album “Donda,” West added fuel to the beef, releasing Drake’s address on his Instagram. Then, he posted a screenshot of a group chat with eight people, including rapper Pusha T and allegedly Drake, where West writes: “I live for this … You will never recover. I promise you.” 
Drake doesn’t shy away from his response to Yeezy, a theme of the album. He attacks the leak of his address directly with ​​the bar “Give that address to your driver, make it your destination, / ‘Stead of just a post out of desperation.”
“7am On Bridle Path” is fiery, similar to “No Friends In The Industry” where Drake wonders why so many in the rap game continue to despise his level of achievement. Rapping over a dark sample, Drake and his cockiness ooze through his tone and fast-paced rapping. 
“No Friends In The Industry” is Drake’s most aggressive attempt at rejecting his haters. Its beat is loud enough to shake your car’s speakers too. Like so many Drake songs, his main message is in the chorus when he raps: “No friends in the industry / I had to draw the line between my brothers and my enemies, a fact.” 
He then uses track star Sha’Carri Richardson’s marijuana scandal to imply he can defeat his enemies: “And I’m like Sha’Carri, smoke ‘em on and off the track (Aye).” 
His final verse of the track takes another shot at Kanye when rapping: “Better find ya someone else to hit with all that smoke, n****, yeah / And all them tweets and all them posts / Ain’t got the type of time to be playin’ with you folk / I had a Richard prior to these n*****, that’s the joke.” 
In the final bar, Drake uses wordplay with “Richard” referring to expensive Richard Mille watches and “prior” to the comedian Richard Pryor. Drake implies his previous “beefs” with rappers weren’t necessary for his growth since he’s already famous enough to own a Richard Mille. It’s emphasized with the phrase: “that’s the joke.” 
CLB shows why Drake has been relevant in the rap game for over a decade. It’s another Drake album full of lyrics that will populate Instagram captions for months. His versatility is on full display with the balance of soft singing and rapid rapping. 
When all is said and done rappers will dream of replicating the rapper’s run. And CLB proves Drake is far from done.

Cup of Troy, a traveling coffee shop run by USC students, made its most recent pit stop Sunday at the Dustbowl — a backyard outfitted as a local music venue. But, NEW.WAV, an event hosted by media company World Wide Waves, was not your average backyard concert. If the harp standing on the stage wasn’t the first clue that the event was going to be something different, then the local businesses lining the sides of the venue highlighted that it would be memorable.
Just beyond the ticket stand and a set of canvas curtains in the side yard, attendees were welcomed into a large open space cleared for a crowd and flanked by tables of crystals, art prints, sandwiches and, of course, coffee. 
The mobile coffee bar, outfitted with a USC logo, sat next to their trademark Cup of Troy flag — a banner with the coffee shop’s name in Trojan cardinal and gold — which hung proudly from a retrofitted grocery-cart-turned-chariot. While interacting with co-workers and customers next to the shop, Cup of Troy founder Shawn Tran, a senior majoring in music industry, gave a history of the student-run coffee shop.  
The coffee shop — created just over a year ago during the coronavirus pandemic — started with a single espresso machine in Tran’s house. With prior barista experience, Tran began making coffee for his friends until his housemates told him they would pay money for it. Deciding to expand the business, Tran made a logo and opened up his house to sell it to the public. Since then, Cup of Troy’s Instagram page — and the company itself — has grown to over 1000 followers.
While Cup of Troy originally only travelled across different parts of campus, Tran decided he wanted to expand both the shop’s boundaries and the types of experiences they shared with students.
“There’s definitely a community aspect to this, we originally started just selling [coffee], but then … we started inviting [musicians] to play because I was a big fan of the whole [idea of enjoying] music while you drink some coffee.”
Even before the music set started, people gathered around the various vendor tables, talking with one another as they met new faces and caught up with old friends. Vendors included BONMì, a Vietnamese style sandwich shop, and Peace of Mind, a company that promotes local artists and hosts events for the Compton community. 
The coffee might have brought people to the event, but the local businesses and music made them stay.  
A recent USC grad, Alyssa Gibson launched her company in January virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic. With NEW.WAV as her second in-person event post-quarantine, Gibson described how conducting business virtually differed from doing so in person. 
“[Selling online] is different than in-person because, obviously, I get to interact with the person physically, it’s not [through] a screen, but I love both experiences,” Gibson said, “I do still very much get that connection with a person who is purchasing something [online].” 
Conversations carrying over the music punctuated her point, showing that real connections were being made — not just transactions. The vendors’ tables stayed busy throughout the night, as students chatted with one another and shared their art. 
Situated across the venue was DJ Mikey Aguilera, who was set up alongside a violin, harp and bass meant for the self-proclaimed “NeoSoul Psychedelic Jazz Rock” band, Marcellina & the Monarchs. 
As live music began, people gathered around the stage, swaying to Marcellina’s songs with Cup of Troy beverages in hand. Content director of World Wide Waves and USC alumnus Faiz Haque spoke about Cup of Troy’s influence on the music scene around the University. 
“They’ve been doing these live music events for the last year or so, they did a lot to revitalize the live music community around USC,” Haque said. “[World Wide Waves and Cup of Troy] were doing shows before [the pandemic], and they built this whole infrastructure and inspired people to get out here and start doing shows.”
Haque also commented on how he hopes to keep working with Cup of Troy to bring people together and share music. 
“I’m excited to just keep going, keep the momentum going and get back into throwing live music shows, because that’s something I was doing before. I was running concerts committee at USC, so we were doing virtual events.” he said.
The line-up showed that World Wide Wave not only attracted an audience but an impressive array of musicians. Along with Marcellina & The Monarchs, performers included Half Moon Bay, Seiji Oda and Sara Kawai — who accompanied multiple artists on her harp. 
It wasn’t just the home-y location that made the event feel tight-knit, but the interactions of attendees with one another. After a year of virtual events held over Zoom, musicians, vendors and students alike were happy to spend time with one another face-to-face. 
“I graduated from USC a few months ago, and it’s great to see all my friends who are still going to school back on campus and [doing stuff],” Haque said. “So yeah, we’re out, we’re open, I’m not looking back. We’re going to keep throwing shows.”
Despite the fact that its following reached four-digits on Instagram, Cup of Troy has continued to retain the closeness it had when the company first started, with Tran simply sharing coffee with his friends. 
While USC’s campus may have drinks at Starbucks or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf that taste similar, they certainly won’t feel the same. Cup of Troy encapsulates what coffee shops were originally meant to do — provide a space for people to collaborate and socialize. Even without a brick-and-mortar store, Cup of Troy brings people together. 
As Tran said, “I think it’s a lot different, events like these, because we have a huge spread of people. I think they’re all just kind of [here] through coffee and the community.”

College football kicked off this past weekend with fantastic matchups and fired-up fans.
Collegiate sports are so exciting because of long-standing rivalries among universities like USC’s very own with our Westwood counterparts, UCLA. Sometimes, these rivalries arise simply due to the fact that the schools are in the same conference or are in close proximity to each other. 
What happens when these programs move to other conferences and significantly change the dynamic they have created all in pursuit of greater profits? 
This is what is happening right now as powerhouse programs Texas and Oklahoma recently announced a shift from the Big 12 to the SEC in 2025. Such decisions have been made in the past, most significantly at the start of the 2010s. 
I remember following Kansas basketball back in elementary and middle school when the Big 12 went through its major conference realignment. From around 2010 to 2013, the Big 12 changed dramatically as schools with historic rivalries with former conference members went to new conferences, fueled by the opportunity to earn more money. Programs like Texas A&M and Missouri left for the SEC and even the Pac-12 added Colorado. 
This isn’t the first time Texas and Oklahoma toyed with the idea of leaving the Big 12. During the early 2010s conference realignment, these two colleges along with Texas Tech and Oklahoma State were strongly considering joining the former Pac-10 (now the Pac-12) but ultimately decided not to because former Big 12 commissioner Dan Beebe promised revised strategies for increased revenue if they decided to stick together. 
To make up for the losses the Big 12 faced, the conference added schools like TCU and West Virginia. For those who don’t know, the Big 12 is primarily a midwestern conference, so the fact that West Virginia was added significantly alters its geographic makeup. But none of that really matters, since the Big 12 just wanted enough money to stay afloat after this scare.
However, the Longhorns and Sooners have the two highest revenues annually among all the teams in the conference and seem to want more. Typically, one way schools receive funds from the conference comes from the revenue that is evenly split among its members. Playing in the Big 12, each of them received around $34 million in the past year. By joining the SEC, the number jumps all the way up to $60 million per year.
The reason the SEC has much more revenue than other conferences like the Big 12 is simply because of the success they’ve had on the field, particularly in football. Famous programs like Alabama, Georgia and LSU as well as former Big 12 members like Texas A&M consistently compete for the national titles and high-paying bowl games. 
Although there are a range of other sports that the SEC offers, football is the one that constantly brings in the most money. Even though the Big 12 has found success in other sports compared to the SEC, Oklahoma and Texas’ decision is primarily motivated by football prospects. The fact that these two schools will be part of the SEC means better recruits will be attracted to the high-profile matchups potential in the conference. 
One slight hurdle is that Texas has a broadcasting agreement with ESPN for their own Longhorn Network which doesn’t expire until 2031. Since ESPN also has the SEC Network, they might be able to alter the deal. Even Texas’ president Jay Hartzell believes that they will end their network to join the SEC. Technically, Texas and Oklahoma can’t leave until the Big 12 media rights deal runs out in 2025, but there have been talks that the two programs can potentially leave earlier through a buyout. 
With the loss of two major institutions, the Big 12 needs to find a way to revitalize itself. There have been advanced talks to bring in BYU, Houston, UCF and Cincinnati, who have all had success in football and basketball recently, to join the conference and help financially counteract Texas and Oklahoma’s departure.
Even though the prospects of having higher-caliber matchups in conferences such as the SEC might be appealing to fans, it hurts schools in other conferences. In order to maintain the power dynamics as a result of the SEC’s growth, the Big 10, ACC and Pac-12 are forming an alliance to improve the coordination and competitiveness in the NCAA.

Women’s soccer won back-to-back matches over Michigan and Western Michigan, managing two consecutive clean sheets after two losses early in the season. 
After their convincing 4-2 win over Utah Valley last Saturday, the Trojans beat the Wolverines in overtime with a hard-fought, narrow 1-0 victory. Despite Michigan’s barrage of shots, USC’s defense, headed by senior goalkeeper Anna Smith’s heroics, kept the Wolverines at bay during regulation time. 
The Trojans endured trials and tribulations during the first half at the U-M Soccer Stadium, facing 14 shots compared to their six attempts. In the seventh minute, referee Marc Lawrence pointed to the penalty spot and awarded Michigan a penalty-kick.
Smith proceeded to deny Michigan’s fifth year senior midfielder Sarah Stratigakis, diving to her left and safely securing the ball — one of Smith’s career-high 11 saves against the Wolverines.
Head coach Keidane McAlpine praised Anna Smith’s integral performance Friday night.  
“In games like these, where the margins are really small, you need your goalkeeper to come up with at least one big save,” McAlpine said. “It’s massive to get that kind of performance, and I think [it] not only gives our team but gives [Smith] more confidence.” 
After quelling Michigan’s offense in the second half, USC entered the first overtime period with a second wind. Seven minutes into extra-time, redshirt senior forward Jada Talley delivered a floating cross from the corner to the back post where freshman midfielder Aaliyah Farmer connected with a towering header and converted the winning goal. Farmer added to her second tally, providing her second goal in four games. 
Before USC’s conference showdown with Michigan, the Trojans were amid a losing record after suffering losses against Pepperdine and BYU in their opening two fixtures. However, McAlpine observed progress in the team’s performance against Michigan.
“One of the things we’re happy to see is some growth; each game we are getting a little bit better at weathering the storm,” he said. “Tonight was a trueexample of that.”
The Trojans continued their winning ways with another victory against Western Michigan, notching a 5-0 performance. 
Senior forward Penelope Hocking started the affair early with a third-minute tap-in goal assisted by redshirt senior midfielder Savannah DeMelo. The Trojans subsequently out-shot Western Michigan 16-3 in the first half.
Hocking continued her scoring ways with a merely identical goal assisted by senior midfielder Madeline Vergura in the 59th minute. In the 72ndminute, junior midfielder Croix Bethune increased USC’s lead with a chipped goal over Western Michigan’s shot-stopper, Lauren Boafo, after a ground pass from junior forward Hannah White. 
White converted her first goal of the season with a shot toward the top left of the box, touching the back of the net in the 73rd minute. Freshman midfielder Simi Awujo ended the scoring barrage with a ground shot into the bottom right corner in the 83rd minute. 
Despite only playing 35 minutes, Hocking ended the match with two goals and six shot attempts. 
“Coming off the big win in the Michigan game, I think we were all pretty stoked, and we wanted to keep it going,” she said. “Our team really felt what it felt like to have a big win, and we let that motivate us going into the next game. That was a belief in ourselves that we are really good and we have the potential to be really good.”
The Trojans currently have a 3-2-0 record after completing a turnaround by amassing three consecutive victories all away from the Coliseum. 
“Team morale is really high, the Pepperdine and BYU [games were] pretty bad losses. It’s super motivating to come off of some big wins,” Hocking said. “Something that is reallyimportant for us going into this next weekend is to not be complacent.”
Women’s soccer team will look to finish off their stretch of away games with a Thursday night victory against University of California,  Santa Barbara at 7 p.m. at the Harder Stadium.
The Trojans next home game is against California State University at Northridge.

As you may have heard from Bo Burnham’s recent musical number, Jeff Bezos is a former CEO and entrepreneur born in 1964. But what are the motivations behind the man, the meme, the infamous legend? Aside from being the founder and current executive chairman of Amazon, having a net worth of nearly $200 billion dollars and soaring into the sky in his suggestively-shaped rocket, the bald-headed billionaire believes that the solution to the climate crisis is outer space. 
In preparation for this week’s installment, I did a simple Google search on the man. This past week’s activities included boarding his $65 million dollar private jet and installing an unlimited soft-serve machine at his residence in Beverly Hills. And not to mention the fact that his ten-minute joyride into space cost $5.5 billion. There’s no doubt about it — Bezos gives capitalism a bad rap. 
Arguably, many of the world’s richest and most influential choose to stay away from sinking their savings into the world’s wicked problems — that is, social, cultural and environmental problems that have plagued our world for centuries. This 21st-century space race of tech billionaires is a perfect counter-solution for Bezos and his company. No bureaucratic red tape or enduring the slow game of large-scale philanthropy. Instead, we’re witnessing the new-age shenanigans of the centibillionaire tech bros in the name of space exploration. 
At the end of the day, everyone can use their money, wealth and power how they see fit. It’d be nice for Bezos to consider investing his incomprehensible wealth into addressing issues such as world hunger and global poverty. But he’s not obligated to spend his money there. With a net worth that is quite literally bigger than the GDP of some countries, Bezos essentially has unmatched funds and power. The world is his oyster, yet he’s chosen to focus his sights far away from Earth. 
The concept of conscientious capitalism, touted by Whole Foods CEO and now Amazon affiliate John Mackey, argues that “all businesses have the potential for a higher purpose besides just maximizing profits.” Like any good oxymoron, capitalism favors throwing money at problems to quickly fix them rather than investing funds, energy and effort into the root of systemic issues. Bezos’s limited attempts at philanthropy show just how that rings true — he’s long been criticized for the inconsistent scale and lack of consequence upon which he donates, dropping $100 million checks with reckless abandon, little organization and ample PR opportunities.
With the creation of the monolithic Amazon’s countless options and same-day shipping, Bezos has arguably ensured that purchase power is in the hands of the consumer. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. 
For those of us on a budget, Amazon is often the cheapest and most convenient way to go. In doing so, we’re literally funding Bezos’s Blue Origin venture, broadening the wealth gap and unnecessarily padding the pockets of the world’s richest man with our latest Prime purchases.
Even if we made every effort to buy locally, ethically and sustainably to reduce our own carbon footprint, a literal trip to space produces a wealth of emissions and particulate pollutants beyond what a single customer could ever offset on their own. On the smallest scale, perhaps Amazon has guaranteed us more purchasing freedom. In the grand scheme of things, however, the benefit of convenience is far outweighed by the cost of Bezos’s ever-expanding business ventures and their profit-prioritizing methods.
Maybe Bezos’s trip to space was merely the billionaire equivalent of a midlife crisis sports car purchase. But while a potential chain of intergalactic Amazon warehouses is intriguing, Bezos’s actions are ultimately irresponsible and prove he only cares about building his own wealth and power.
Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the United States; however, a $15 minimum wage and grueling warehouse working conditions — determined through inhumane data driven quotas — exacerbate wealth disparities. Although Bezos has the resources to mitigate global poverty, food shortages and even improve educational equity, he instead chose to spend it on one tangible, fleeting flight. 
The company’s production processes are still unquestionably detrimental to the environment. Bezos recently made a $10 billion pledge to the climate change cause, but his gestures shouldn’t distract from the actions of his company. Amazon has a steadily increasing carbon footprint despite releasing a list of vague climate pledges, including achieving carbon neutrality by 2040. However, if we don’t focus on rapid environmental improvement in the short-term, we may not be able to aspire at all in the long-term.
Bezos’s climate pledge is the ultimate hypocrisy — Amazon’s business model relies on overconsumption. We buy things online constantly, lured in by one-click purchases and same-day delivery. Amazon is a large part of exactly what is destroying the earth.
Instead of losing money by making Amazon a more eco-friendly conglomerate, Bezos himself continues to promote consumer culture. He is responsible for a disproportionate amount of environmental damage; however, he effectively pushes the responsibility of environmental damage onto the consumers. Likewise, capitalism shifts the blame for environmental problems onto those who don’t have the power to fix them, which further exacerbates existing issues. It creates a positive feedback loop of future environmental damage as we continue to buy poorly made, cheap and convenient products.
It’s nearly impossible to avoid Amazon entirely these days —trust me, I’m trying — and the problem goes a whole lot deeper. Bezos conducts business as usual and looks to the stars to solve problems, but he should start with his own company, on his own planet. 
While the tech bros may be celebrating Bezos’s successful ride to space, don’t be surprised when he books a one-way, one-man flight aboard his evocative spacecraft, leaving the rest of us to live with the consequences of Amazon’s actions.

The 2018 election in California was nothing short of predictable. John Cox, a Republican businessman, lost by approximately three million votes to former Democratic mayor of San Francisco and then-Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. Californians voted, the results were what they had expected and life went on. 
Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. Gov. Newsom was the first United States governor to instate a stay-at-home order on March 19, 2020.  He also declared a state of emergency and worked to pass pandemic financial relief in the form of stimulus checks. The campaign to recall him had already begun, and disgruntled Republicans were further motivated to strengthen this effort by targeting Newsom’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. 
By using inflammatory language similar to that used by former President Donald Trump, this ridiculous campaign gained notoriety. Proponents of the recall complain that Newsom’s actions ruined businesses and exemplified government overreach, among other reasons. They also used coded language such as, “Funding Illegal Alien owned businesses in the amount of $50 Million because CA received federal funding for the Covid-19/Corona Virus.” This quote comes directly from the “Recall Gavin 2020” website. It makes the unbacked claim that Newsom gave money to immigrant-owned businesses but calls said immigrants “illegal,” paying homage to Trump’s xenophobic language.
Compared to the 2020 Presidential Election, this recall election may not be receiving the same attention and care from young people, but in many senses — particularly those related to coronavirus — it is just as important and warrants more concern.
The frontrunner who could potentially replace Newsom is pro-Trump, libertarian talk show host Larry Elder, who plans on repealing vaccine and mask mandates on his first day in office. This is not to discount his other dangerous ideas, such as that women should tolerate sexual harassment from men in the workplace and that employers should be able to ask women if they plan on starting a family. 
While these comments should certainly be enough to encourage college students to vote, it is unrealistic to expect college students in California to be directly involved in election efforts in addition to their busy academic schedules because these beliefs may not directly impact their daily lives. 
This recall election has the potential to not only upend our daily lives in this uncertain time but also have a potentially negative impact on our college careers, which have already been plagued by a year and a half of Zoom lectures and boring weekends. 
Without mask mandates — especially for indoor establishments — and vaccine requirements, cases will inevitably rise. This means a new, potentially more dangerous variant could appear, and colleges, including USC, will have to adapt to these changing conditions. 
We do not want to go back to Zoom lectures or virtual football games. Our state has come so far, and we must maintain this momentum with a governor who listens to science. Newsom may not be perfect, but he is our best shot at defeating this pandemic and avoiding hospital overcrowding. Moreover, he will be up for re-election in 2022, and if you still dislike him, you can vote him out then, rather than during a poorly orchestrated recall election that has cost taxpayers millions of dollars. 
Additionally, our concerns should go beyond coronavirus, as Elder said he supports a $0 minimum wage and does not see racism as a relevant issue in the U.S. It may go without saying, but both of these platforms would affect us as college students as we try to make ends meet and create a more equitable world.
The recall election officially takes place on Sept. 14, but mail-in ballots have already been sent to all registered voters at their registered addresses. Early voting information and drop-off box locations can both be accessed on the California Secretary of State’s government website. 
Voting is always important, and this election is no exception. There are reasons to be upset with our democratic process, where moderate candidates often overshadow progressive ones and change is more incremental than it should be. President Joe Biden is a perfect example, as he was arguably the most moderate democratic candidate in the 2020 primaries and does not support certain progressive initiatives such as the Green New Deal. 
While the issues with our democracy should not be ignored, we will only get further from a more equitable democracy if we allow a pro-Trump governor to gain jurisdiction over our state.
