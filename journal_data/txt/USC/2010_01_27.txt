The candidates for this year’s Undergraduate Student Government election were announced Wednesday night. With the actual campaigning period beginning Feb. 8, the candidates are currently in a research period to assess the needs of their constituents.
There are more candidates this year than ever before, with four presidential tickets, nine residential senator candidates, three commuter senator candidates and three Greek senator candidates.
The amount far exceeded the expectations of the Committee of Elections and Recruitment.
“I’m really excited about the number of candidates,” said Arnela Sulovic, assistant director of Elections and Recruitment. “When there are more people running, it improves the quality of the person chosen for that position.”
Emiko Suzuki, co-director of Elections and Recruitment, attributed the large number of candidates to USG’s improved visibility. More people know about USG, she said, so more people want to get involved.
More senators could still join the mix, as write-in applications are not due until Feb. 15. Come election time, the student body will elect a president and vice president, six residential senators, three commuter senators and three Greek senators.
After a mandatory candidates’ meeting Wednesday night, Suzuki said she was glad the candidates asked questions, as it shows they’re serious about running a clean campaign.
An event called “Rock the Vote” will be held on the first day of elections to promote political advocacy on campus. The event will include musical performances and guest speakers.
Agree with Nick. Also, there were more candidates in 2006.
So, who are the presidential candidates???

Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who is vying for Sen. Barbara Boxer’s (D-Calif.) U.S. Senate seat, held a roundtable discussion with students from USC and several other California universities Wednesday, stressing her dedication to creating jobs and lowering the federal deficit. The event was also met with a small protest from members of USC College Democrats.
Campaign · Senatorial candidate Carly Fiorina spoke to students Wednesday in Doheny Library. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
Fiorina, who is running against former California Congressman Tom Campbell and California State Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary, recently launched 17 campaign coalitions, including Students for Carly, the group that sponsored Wednesday’s event.
At the roundtable, Fiorina criticized Sen. Boxer’s record, calling her a “uniquely failed senator” and emphasized the high unemployment rate in California.
“What’s going on in California demonstrates that we can kill the American Dream,” she said.
California, Fiorina said, used to be a place for innovation, but it is now plagued by unemployment and a large deficit.
Though Fiorina lacks political experience, she argued that her background prepares her for Washington the same as a background in politics.
“Our founding fathers intended this to be a citizen government,” Fiorina said. “I am a citizen who understands how jobs are created.”
Fiorina said she would focus on allowing small businesses to grow.
“I come from a very different point of view than Barbara Boxer or President Obama,” she said. “I think they believe that government is the answer. I don’t think it is. The way you create jobs is not through government. The way you create jobs is to make it easier for those people who actually create the jobs — innovators, entrepreneurs and small businesses.”
She also voiced her support for strict limits on federal spending, saying she would move to force government agencies to reduce spending by 5 percent.
Addressing health care reform, Fiorina only said that there are many other issues to be discussed before such a sweeping reform bill should be considered.
Fiorina said she has focused on the employment issue because of the impact it could have on young voters.
“Young people are very influential, but also a lot of the problems we’re trying to solve are going to impact young people the most if we don’t solve them,” she said.
Students at the event responded well to Fiorina’s points.
“It was thought-provoking,” said Rob McCarty, a sophomore majoring in business administration who said he has not decided whom he is voting for yet. “I especially liked her firm stance with the Wall Street banks, even though it may not be as copacetic with other conservatives. I felt that she has the ambition, she has the charisma to be able to bring about some sort of change.”
Dylan Steinman, a sophomore majoring in economics and political science who describes himself as a swing voter, said he is now planning to vote for Fiorina.
“I really am confident in her,” he said. “I think that she’s pretty bipartisan. I think that she’s really trying to get something done and that she won’t necessarily just vote along party lines.”
Alexa Ekman and Lauren Korbatov, co-chairs of the newly founded USC Students for Carly, said they were excited by the turnout and the response from students.
“So far the excitement has been really overwhelming because students see how the economic issues are going to affect them,” Korbatov said.
Ekman said the group will continue to recruit members and “to shine a light on exactly what she said today and Barbara Boxer’s failed record and inefficiency, just to prove to Californians and students that we need a new candidate in D.C.”
Students on the other side of the aisle are less sold on Fiorina’s promises, however.
“She’s a failed CEO who was fired at HP for being mean and incompetent,” said Bob Mulholland, senior adviser to the California Democratic Party, who helped USC College Democrats organize the protest. “Now she’s acting as if she’s God’s gift to California.”
Though the protest only attracted six people, Micah Scheindlin, a junior majoring in American studies and the political director for USC College Democrats, said he was pleased with the result, given that they had little notice of the event. He said the group wanted to provide an opposing view point in light of Fiorina’s appearance.
“Carly Fiorina is not a good candidate for California — that’s how we feel, that’s how the state party feels, and we wanted to make our voices heard,” he said.
We only had a three day notice and there were actually about 40 Republicans there and a lot more wanted to join. It was cut off at that number because it was a round table discussion and was meant to be much more intimate.
6 protesters with a 24 hour notice to 15 Republicans with who knows how much time.
And I thought USC was conservative!

In his first State of the Union address, President Barack Obama stressed the need for bipartisanship in Washington to help the country continue toward economic recovery, pushed for health care reform and focused on easing the financial burden for those paying for higher education.
Presidential · Students watch the State of the Union address at the Davidson Conference Center. The viewing was sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
Obama’s speech Wednesday was broadcast at the USC Davidson Conference Center after a pre-State of the Union discussion led by Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. The event was hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, the Unruh Institute and the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
The panelists — Schnur; Geneva Overholser, director of the School of Journalism; and Hillel Aaron, opinion editor of Neon Tommy, an online publication of Annenberg — focused on how Obama should address the American people in light of waning confidence reflected in his struggles to implement health care reform.
“The disappointment when you get into the presidential seat and you can’t do what you promised to do feels even more intense,” Overholser said. “When people feel that they’ve had this really powerful connection with somebody, then they’re more disappointed when he doesn’t turn out to be what they expected.”
Obama’s address focused on the steps that need to be taken to restore America’s faith in the economy.
“As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it’s time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our financial growth,” Obama said.
Among his efforts to add jobs, cut taxes, increase security and freeze discretionary funding, Obama promised to make college affordable.
“No one should go broke because they chose to go to college,” Obama said.
Obama said he plans to increase Pell grants, give tax credits for higher education and institute a loan-forgiveness plan, as well as encourage universities to lower costs.
Jafet Santiago, a junior majoring in political science who plans to attend law school, said Obama’s pledge to help students pay for college was absolutely the right promise to make.
“It’s a huge deal in California, where community colleges … are cutting back on their classes and their semesters,” said Santiago, a self-described Republican.
Santiago transferred to USC from Santa Monica Community College, where he said he saw the school suffer in the face of a struggling economy.
Despite the recent blow to health care reform with the election of Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) to replace the late Ted Kennedy as one of Massachusetts’ senators, Obama continued to press the need for change in the current system.
“Here’s what I ask Congress though: Don’t walk away from reform, not now, not when we are so close,” Obama said. “Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let’s get it done.”
Health care reform was a major topic for the discussion panel, along with debate about the social networking nature of the media and Obama’s past promises.
Though opinions on Obama’s presidency differ, Stephen Lamb, a junior majoring in history, said the turnout at the event is an encouraging sign.
“I think the most important part of his speech is his audience, and it’s a real sign of the attention that our demographic received,” he said.

A renowned Asian pop culture magazine that specializes in multimedia content is moving from Westwood to South LA. and will now be published at USC.
Asia Pacific Arts, an online magazine featuring interviews and music clips from Asian and Asian American artists is now being published by the USC US-China Institute in partnership with the USC East Asian Studies Center and the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism. Until September, the magazine was published at the UCLA Asia Institute.
“The USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism views Asia Pacific Arts as a great opportunity to capitalize on and link several key programs at Annenberg: our growing global network of scholars and practitioners, especially in Asia, and our thriving programs in arts journalism and entertainment studies,” Carola Weil, associate dean for planning and strategic initiatives at Annenberg, told USC News.
With the switch in publisher, the magazine also went through a significant redesign and will soon be expanding its coverage.
Many USC students have already started contributing to the publication.

According to Merriam-Webster, a dream consists of a series of thoughts, images or emotions occurring during sleep.
Dreamy · Baltimore-based indie dream-pop duo Beach House delivers its third studio album. Teen Dream is a follow up to 2008’s Devotion. - Photos courtesy of Forcefield PR 
It is fitting, then, that Baltimore-based Beach House has been overwhelmingly tagged by the music media as a dream-pop outfit since the guy-girl duo broke onto the scene in 2006 with its self-titled debut.
Perhaps more fitting still is the title of the duo’s latest album — Teen Dream. A colorful confection of shimmering guitars, soaring organ lines and reposeful vocals, the album delivers what its title promises. The album takes listeners through a series of dreams, some more emotionally affecting than others, but it will hardly put you to sleep.
When Maryland-native Alex Scally (guitar, keyboard) and French-born Victoria Legrand (vocals, organ) released Beach House nearly four years ago, it was difficult to imagine where the duo could go from there. Not only did the stellar lo-fi record receive high praise and acclaim, but Legrand’s gauzy vocals paired with the duo’s minimalist, yet infinitely atmospheric instrumentation, was so complete and assured that even as a debut, it left a strong imprint on the indie-rock scene.
In 2008, Beach House outdid itself with Devotion, a richer follow-up that added layers like one would add pastel-colored chiffon to a ball gown. The keyboards and organ were thicker without suffocating the band’s vast dreamscapes, while Legrand’s gutteral vocals felt more resounding than her delicate whispers featured on the group’s debut.
But Teen Dream, the duo’s first album released on Sub Pop Records, certainly marks a career-best for the band — that is, until the release of their next album.
Unlike Beach House’s earlier records, where the songs seeped into one another as if they had no end, each track on Teen Dream exists within its own musical sphere. Like one would experience in the midst of a deep rapid-eye-movement slumber, each song plays as an individual dream, conjuring its own wave of images and sentiments that range from contentment to nostalgia to heartbreak. Although Beach House and Devotion were cohesive in their nine- and 10–song entireties, respectively, Teen Dream is complete with 10 mini-operas, all possessing a solid beginning, middle and end — no thought or melody goes unfinished.
Album opener “Zebra” begins with dizzying synthesizer lines and Legrand’s trademark smoky “oohs.” Beach House doesn’t seem to waste a second on its third record, as “Zebra” provides a powerful rather than subdued lead-in with its orchestral flair that confidently rivals the multi-instrumentation of indie-rock royalty Arcade Fire.
Following “Zebra,” Beach House immediately switches to the languid “Silver Soul,” a ballad that engulfs listeners in a wave of melancholy with a slow-churning melody and lyrics like It’s incomplete without you / The silver soul is running through.
“Norway” is easily Teen Dream’s most pop-infused track with its sunny chorus and back-up “ah-ah-ahs,” while the hook-driven “Better Times” and sweet-sounding “Lover of Mine” showcase the duo’s deft use of percussion and intricate keyboard riffs.
But the true dream-pop gem of Teen Dream is “Real Love,” which surprises long after the album’s midpoint. A lesson in expressive songwriting, “Real Love” utilizes Beach House’s previous lo-fi atmospheric charm but refines it, restraining the whirling guitar and tinkling percussion and returning to that sparse yet infinite space the duo explored on its debut.
More than any other song on Teen Dream, “Real Love” stirs with each line. Beginning with nothing but a pounding piano, “Real Love” highlights the mournful Legrand, whose voice fluctuates from soulful breaths to shadowy wails on lines like I met you somewhere in a hell beneath the stairs / There’s someone in that room that frightens you when they go boom, boom, boom.
Following the elegiac “Real Love” is album closer “Take Care,” which ensures Teen Dream ends on a brighter, more buoyant note. Legrand’s throaty intonation rises over the grand instrumentation like a one-woman gospel choir, and the organ continues to heighten until the record’s very last note.
Packaged as a two-disc deal, Teen Dream also features a DVD composed of music videos for each track. Although the videos are a pleasant touch, the vast soundscapes Beach House creates is enough of a visceral experience to intoxicate even the most stoic realist.

Most people will tell you that a computer is nothing more than a time waster, and that doing something productive usually requires that you log off. In this case, however, the popular knowledge doesn’t hold. Computers and the Internet are some of the most important tools college students have to make their lives easier, more efficient and a lot more interesting. 
Going beyond Wikipedia, the Internet boasts a wide range of websites and blogs that offer tips on everything from beefing up your productivity to simplifying your life. Luckily for you, some are even geared specifically toward college students.
Many of these sites provide an array of so-called lifehacks — basically tips that solve casual problems in non-obvious ways, ultimately increasing productivity.
“Lifehacking is just thinking outside the box,” said Chris Lesinski, co-founder of the website Hackcollege.com. “It’s using shortcuts and saving time. I honestly think that one of the most valuable resources in life is time — more important than money and even beer. So, saving time doing things you hate leaves time to enjoy yourself. Why do it any other way?”
After Googling “productivity tips for students” one day, a whole new corner of the Internet opened up, a new face of the all-too-familiar World Wide Web that (unexpectedly) provided something useful and interesting, not just funny and distracting.
The preeminent site for lifehacks is — surprise, surprise — Lifehacker.com. Part of the Gawker Media network, the regularly updated blog features unusual guides to everything from office setup to do-it-yourself tech solutions. The bulk of the tips prove eminently useful, and, because of the large number of posts per week, readers are bound to find something that applies to their lives from time to time.
SavvyStudent.com, another site aimed at helping college students, is basically a catchall for college advice. Beyond the requisite financial aid tips, everything from lists on unusual and lucrative college jobs to cooking ideas for the gastronomically disinclined student.
Another must-read is Tim Ferriss’ blog. Ferriss, the author of the New York Times best seller The 4-Hour Work Week, is a veritable well of unexpectedly useful information. Whether it’s physical health — because apparently people need to be told that a ramen–heavy diet is not a guarantor of six-pack abs — or learning new languages, some of the best guides and product reviews can be found on his site.
One of the best websites for making college life easier and more enjoyable is the aforementioned Hackcollege.com. Created by Lesinski and Kelly Sutton, two Loyola Marymount University students (the duo now teaches a class on web video distribution there), the site features tips and reviews on things ranging from finding the best espresso machine for the lowest cost or “10 ways to find a lost Word document.”
What makes these websites and blogs so useful, more so than, say, books or just trying things out for your own? The fact that everything is changing. Look at social media, for instance: It has gone from early e-mail to Myspace, Facebook and Twitter in less than 10 years. Who is to say what will be the best tool in the next two or three years?
“Real world sources like books stale quickly,” said Sutton. “New software is constantly being released. We’re big fans of Google Docs, but it might not be around forever or a better service might come out. By reading HackCollege and other sites, you will always stay up-to-date on the best tools for students.”
Part of the reason these sites are so true to life is because they are written by college students, for college students. These websites aren’t corporate-run proxies intended to imply the need for some new product. Instead, these are simply a collection of advice from students writing from experience on
what works, what doesn’t and what makes life a lot easier.
“Reading about and implementing lifehacks teaches some great life skills usually not learned until students enter the real world,” Sutton said. “Having a cohesive organization system is key to getting your work done on time. Analyzing your productivity on a meta level allows you to make much more pragmatic choices in life.”
It’s important to keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not some magical cure-all, instantly able to fix any problem you encounter.
“It’s tempting to throw the Internet at every problem a student has, but it definitely won’t solve everything,” Sutton said. “The first step to applying the capacity of the Internet is to understand what it enables and what it does best.”
So technology and the Internet may not be the ultimate solution to all the problems college throws at us, but it is still an invaluable tool. The next time someone tells you to get off the computer and do something productive, tell him you already are.

Tuesday night, students and alumni of the School of Cinematic Arts celebrated their projects that have been accepted at the Sundance Film Festival. The annual USC Festival Cocktail Party, held at the Riverhorse in Downtown Park City, Utah, has become tradition for Trojans visiting Utah during the famed film festival.
“This is one of the largest gatherings of alumni of the School of Cinematic Arts throughout the entire year,” CEO of the USC Alumni Association Scott Mory said. “And for us it’s important to be where our alumni are so we can support them.”
This year, Sundance is showcasing films from more than 25 USC filmmakers with entries spread across all of Sundance’s categories. The films represent a non-ageist cross section of USC-bred talent and, with many having more than one alumnus in its credits, it’s no wonder that the party was packed.
Some notable films from this year include The Dry Land, written and directed by Ryan Piers Williams (’05), co-produced by Jason Berman (’06), with cinematography by Gavin Kelly (’04); Night Catches Us, co-produced by Katie Mustard (’01); and Lucky, directed by Jeffrey Blitz (’97), edited by Yana Gorskaya (’02), with supervising post sound by Peter Brown (’95).
Even the instant hit The Kids Are All Right starring Julianne Moore and Annette Bening was co-produced by alumnus Joel Newton (’00).
As one of the most influential film schools in the country, it’s only fitting that projects made by alumni are being shown at an industry-defining festival such as Sundance. And with such a long-standing history in the medium, it’s no wonder the work of former USC students have been chosen to represent the future of independent cinema.
These include films not only accepted by the Sundance Institute, but also by the concurrently running Slamdance Festival and the Windrider Forum. Since independent filmmaking, by definition, relies heavily on film financing outside the major studio system and acceptance at these annual events aids filmmakers in getting their movie out to the public.
Professor Howard A. Rodman, a SCA screenwriting professor, says the purpose of a USC party at Sundance is to unite all of the Trojans spending the week in Park City.
“It’s about gathering together the community,” Rodman said. “There is an enormous number of USC people who come here for the festival in all kinds of capacities, both as filmmakers and as moviegoers.”
Organizing a party during the largest independent film festival, however, is no easy task. Once the Sundance Institute’s selection process results are released in December, Justin Wilson — director of alumni relations for the School of Cinematic Arts — gets to work. His team starts by sending out an e-mail blast to more than 10,000 USC students and alumni, inviting them to RSVP and share whether they participated in the upcoming films. Those who indicate direct involvement with an accepted work are invited to an exclusive filmmakers’ breakfast the day before the party so they can meet their fellow USC filmmakers and build further relationships in the industry.
“We come to Sundance to act as cheerleaders for all of the USC alumni and student filmmakers,” Wilson said. “We want to support them in any way we can, and the party is a good way for all them to mingle in one setting.”
What’s also great about the evening’s cocktail party is that the greater USC community is involved as well. Because the event is also sponsored by the USC Alumni Association, it represents commitment from the larger community and ensures that the focus is not only on those directly affiliated with the SCA.
As Rodman puts it: “Sundance is a place where filmmakers make films that change people’s lives … These are films that change the world.”

After two thrilling come-from-behind victories on the road against the Washington schools last weekend, the Women of Troy return to the friendly confines of the Galen Center riding a four-game win streak.
Crunch time · Senior guard Ashley Corral is part of the Women of Troy team, which has to bear down as conference play heats up. USC opens a two-game home stand tonight against Oregon State at 7 p.m. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Women of Troy (12-6, 6-1) will welcome the Oregon State Beavers (9-8, 1-6) to begin their home stand tonight.
After winning their last five conference games, the Women of Troy will be looking to hold onto their second place standing in the Pac-10 and stay in contention for a conference title.
Approaching the midway point of their conference schedule, the Women of Troy know they have to stay focused and keep their attention on the game at hand if they intend on competing for the Pac-10 title.
“The most important thing on our mind is Oregon State. We’re not really worrying about anything else. We just have to protect home court,” senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes said.
Junior guard Talisa Rhea, who is averaging about 22 points per game in conference play, leads the Beavers at Galen tonight. Last year, Rhea was named an honorable mention All Pac-10 performer.
Rhea and the Beavers are among the nation’s best in rebounding, ranking 20th in rebounding margin and averaging 7.7 rebounds more than their opponents this season.
The Women of Troy have struggled to rebound the ball defensively this season, ranking last in the conference.
Containing Rhea and keeping the Beavers off the offensive glass will be no easy task.
“It’s going to be a team effort. We’re going to have to throw some different things at her and we’re going to have to take care of the boards,” Hughes said.
The Beavers are also a solid club defensively, holding opponents to under 40 percent field goal shooting and allowing about 56 points per contest. During one stretch this season, they held opponents to 49 points or less in four consecutive games.
Another noteworthy statistic is the Beavers’ 8-1 record when leading at halftime, although the Women of Troy have made it a habit to rally from halftime deficits with four come-from-behind victories in as many games.
“We just want to get off to a good start,” associate coach Ervin Monier said. “It’s been good that we’ve been finishing games well and showing some resiliency, but at some point, it’d be nice getting in front and getting ahead and then holding on.”
During their win streak, the Women of Troy have received solid contributions from their starting five and their bench.
To protect their home court, more of the same will be needed.
“Every set of games are the most important games,” Monier said. “Right now, we’re taking it one game at a time.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Congratulations on a stellar four-year career with USC, Taylor Mays.
Now go ahead and play the opposite of your trademark style.
That’s essentially the message that the Trojans’ star safety has been receiving this week as he practices for Saturday’s Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. Even though it’s difficult to glean too much from an all-star game, Mays’ approach is coming under scrutiny. 
At USC, Mays was revered by fans and coaches alike. He became the face of a program as a senior, albeit with disappointing team and individual results.
Mays showed he could at least approach the enormous hype that had followed him throughout his career (think back to his superhuman efforts against California), and his play always left observers wanting more.
But the criticism Mays received while in Los Angeles can’t compare with the lingering questions he faces from NFL teams interested in drafting him. And the severity of the concerns may force Mays to do some serious evaluating of his game.
Following Tuesday’s practice, Tony Pauline wrote on SportsIllustrated.com that Mays “looked stiff and mechanical with his defensive back fundamentals and really showed limited skills in pass coverage drills.” He also noted that “teams may start projecting Mays to outside linebacker based on his inability to make plays in centerfield.”
The analysis cuts deep for Mays because it gets to the very core of who he is as a player. Everyone at USC was tantalized with the idea of having a super-sized safety roaming the middle of the field. But the physical skill set that once seemed to be a point of pride now seems to be at least in some way a hindrance.
Criticism · Senior safety Taylor Mays made a name for himself with big hits and athleticism during his time with the Trojans. But the NFL draft prospect is seeing critical remarks for his focus on highlight reel hits. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
Mays also carved out his niche at USC with a unique role in the defense. Pete Carroll’s phobia of teams throwing deep made it so that Mays frequently dropped so deep into coverage that it was almost ill-befitting of even a safety. Carroll frequently explained Mays’ lack of interceptions by saying that teams were afraid to throw anywhere near him, relegating his biggest plays to come on violent collisions.
But fairly or unfairly, Mays is now being scrutinized for being a potential liability in coverage. It’s a question Mays will have to answer quickly; safeties who are vulnerabilities in the passing game have a nasty habit of making early exits from the NFL.
Of course, Mays is not among the biggest reclamation projects at the Senior Bowl. Carroll still set Mays up to succeed at the professional level, something that can’t be taken for granted in the current landscape of coaching where winning takes priority over everything else.
Florida coach Urban Meyer, for instance, left star quarterback Tim Tebow riddled with questions that he’s still trying to answer this week as he attempts to salvage his draft stock. Tebow may be the most scrutinized player in the draft, and his stock is not as highly regarded as Mays.
But both players are being asked to radically change their approach to the game, and it won’t come easy. Mays never made excuses for his lack of interceptions, but he may have to give up his inclination to deliver knockout hits if he’s going to be seen as a legitimate safety professionally. And if he shows the same weaknesses for whatever team drafts him in the first round, the critiques will only get louder.
Mays doesn’t face too difficult a road toward salvaging his draft stock, however. A solid showing Saturday would go a long way toward erasing any doubts raised this week in practices. And there’s little doubt that he will shine in both USC’s Pro Day and at the Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.
And barring an unforeseen tumble in the draft, Mays will still sign an exorbitant contract that will set him up for life.
Ah, to have the problems of Taylor Mays.

With signing day quickly approaching, football recruits will visit USC this weekend to meet with the Trojans’ coaches and staff and tour the football and campus facilities.
The Feb. 3 signing date is especially important for recruits who have not offered a commitment to any school and are visiting USC in the upcoming days.
Four-star recruit safety Demar Dorsey, who is nationally ranked among the top 15 at his position, will visit campus Friday. If he joins USC, Dorsey could be among the Trojan hopefuls looking to replace departing senior safety Taylor Mays.
The safety looked to be headed to Gainsville, Fla. to join the Florida Gators at the beginning of the recruiting season, but after he refused to cancel his trip to USC, his offer from the Gators was withdrawn.
Dietrich Riley, another four-star recruit at safety, will also be on campus this weekend. Riley was recruited by one of the newest Trojan coaches, Willie Mack Garza.
Joining Dorsey and Riley this weekend will be Eureka, Calif.-native fullback, and sometimes linebacker Soma Vainuku.
Vainuku had planned to visit Oregon State this weekend, but his interest in visiting the USC campus changed his plans.
“I’m down to two schools: ASU and USC,” Vainuku told ESPN. “This is honestly one of the toughest decisions I have ever made.”
Former USC offensive line coach Pat Ruel recruited the 251-pound Vainuku but Ruel was let go from the Trojan staff last week, so Vainuku’s recruitment remains up in the air.
Seeing how Anthony McCoy is at the Senior Bowl this week, the Trojans will be in the market for a new tight end this recruiting season, and four-star recruit tight end Christian Thomas is also among the visitors coming to campus this weekend.
Thomas was recruited by tight ends coach Brennan Carroll, former coach Pete Carroll’s son. Brennan Carroll was among those new coach Lane Kiffin retained after the coaching switch, a continuity that will likely help the Trojans in Thomas’ recruitment.
The second-ranked commit from the state of Maryland, four-star offensive tackle Arie Kouandjio, will also join the slew of recruits this weekend as the Trojans look to replace a large contingent of departing seniors from the offensive line.
Kiffin reportedly visited Kouandijo in Maryland on Tuesday, although the 325-pound lineman has made no school a favorite in his recruiting.
Offensive lineman Chaz Green will also make his official visit this weekend.
The Trojans will also welcome other recruits who have verbally committed to other schools in one final attempt to convince them to join the Trojans.
Five-star recruit athlete Latwan Anderson, four-star cornerback Nickell Robey and three-star linebacker Jordan Zumwalt will all be on campus before they make their final decisions Wednesday.
Wow, whoever wrote this is clueless.. He’s using internet message boards as his source..
Asher,
So are you saying that Vainuku has canceled his trip to Oregon State because he likes the new coaching staff and is now excited about joining USC or he canceled the Oregon State trip because Ruel was not effective in recruiting him (terrible recruiter from day one) and now that we have good recruiters recruiting Vainuku he wants to be part of the team? I think what you are trying to say is Ruel has been an ineffective recruiter (never enjoyed recruiting) and the new staff has picked it up considerably since Ruel’s departure.  It just sounded confusing to me.
Fight On!
Quote: “Vainuku had planned to visit Oregon State this weekend, but his interest in visiting the USC campus changed his plans. “I’m down to two schools: ASU and USC,” Vainuku told ESPN. “This is honestly one of the toughest decisions I have ever made.” Former USC offensive line coach Pat Ruel recruited the 251-pound Vainuku but Ruel was let go from the Trojan staff last week.”

More than halfway into a season filled with ups and downs, USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill has stayed true to a certain mantra about playing in the Pac-10.
Bench factor · With the middle of the season behind them, the Trojans will be relying on bench players like senior guard Donte Smith to help keep the team rested and keep energy up through the end of the season. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
“It’s a league where anything can happen,” O’Neill said. “No game’s going to be easy for us.”
Oregon State coach Craig Robinson holds a similar view on conference competition.
“We understand that any of the other nine teams can beat us at any point in time,” Robinson said.
That’s why you can expect neither team to enter tonight’s game at Oregon State unprepared. The Trojans (12-7, 4-3) are fresh off a blowout victory against Washington at the Galen Center — where they posted a season-high 87 points ­— and currently sit tied for second in the Pac-10. Meanwhile, Oregon State (8-11, 2-5) has fallen to the bottom of the conference standings after dropping its last three contests.
But since the beginning of the season, O’Neill has reminded his players not to underestimate any squad ­— even one as seemingly vulnerable as the Beavers — and he doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.
“Especially when you’re on the road, anything can happen to anybody,” O’Neill said. “Oregon State’s had some good wins. They’re a challenging team for us.”
Those wins include recent victories against Oregon and Arizona. And just last Saturday, the Beavers nearly upset Pac-10 front-runner California, the same team that handed USC a 67-59 defeat earlier in the month.
O’Neill hopes the Trojans will bring the same kind of concentration to Oregon State that they showed against Washington.
“If you take the last three games — 120 minutes — we had 10 bad minutes of defense,” he said. “That was against Washington State and cost us the lead.”
Unlike the Washington schools, the Beavers don’t boast a high-powered attack, guard Calvin Haynes leads the team in scoring at 12.3 points per game, and USC will look to its perimeter defenders, especially senior guard Dwight Lewis and redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson, to make sure it stays that way.
Johnson, who is averaging 16 points per game in his last three, is playing particularly well of late.
“He’s had a real high energy level on both ends of the court,” O’Neill said of Johnson. “He’s taking the ball to the basket. I couldn’t be happier with the way he’s playing.”
Taking a cue from Johnson’s recent heroics — a jaw-dropping alley-oop dunk against Washington being the most memorable — the Trojans plan on running early and often. O’Neill noted that redshirt senior guard and floor general Mike Gerrity has been more effective leading USC in transition than in set plays.
“Mike Gerrity is a little bit better of a full-court point guard,” O’Neill said. “When teams trap us, he’s good enough with the basketball that it creates opportunities. We always look forward to teams pressuring us and getting out and getting after us.”
But as always, O’Neill continued to stress the importance of playing hard on both sides of the ball.
“The key for us is not having any letdowns of any extended period of time because we just can’t recover from those,” he said. “We know that if we don’t play well, we won’t have a chance.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 5:30 p.m.

After days of speculation about the Apple tablet flooding your Facebook news feeds and Twitter streams, it is finally official.
On Wednesday, Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the company’s highly anticipated latest creation, the iPad. Aimed at bridging the gap between smart phones and traditional laptops, this device is multi-faceted, offering possibilities for web surfing, video watching and electronic book reading. Although this might sound at first like a revolutionary creation, many still wonder: Why would consumers pay hundreds of dollars for yet another Internet-connected screen?
Daily Trojan | Thomas Curry
With a country that has only just begun to rebound economically, who has the money to keep on buying Jobs’ line of high-end tech toys?
One would assume that an influx of cost-cutting consumers is eating into Apple’s bottom line.
This is not the case, however. What’s even more astonishing is the fact that college students, although a number of them are tightening their budgets, are buying Macs, iPods and iPhones in escalating numbers.
A survey of 1,200 college undergraduates conducted last year by Student Monitor, a market research agency that focuses exclusively on college students’ habits and behaviors, found that 43 percent of those who intended to buy a notebook computer anticipated buying a Mac. According to Eric Weil, the agency’s managing partner, this figure represented double of those who said they planned on purchasing a notebook by Dell and seven times as many as those who intended on buying one by Hewlett-Packard.
USC’s campus is no exception to this phenomenon of Apple hysteria. Both Leavey and Doheny Libraries feature rows of Apple computers. What’s more, the majority of our Trojan population seems to own MacBooks and iPods.
Sowjanya Chintalapati, a freshman majoring in architecture and a Mac user, puts it best: “Mac is like a cult. Once you own one, you feel like you’re a part of this close Mac community.”
But what is the impetus for this accelerating trend?
Apple has a reputation of being the “cool” brand. Owning Apple products makes people feel modern, popular and part of the in-crowd.
Yet, although Apple’s products may have evolved to be status symbols, the secret behind their loyal customer base lies in something that is more than just skin deep. The reality is far less complicated ­— Apple simply has a large group of very satisfied customers.
The primary aspect of Apple’s customer satisfaction lies in the efficient and user-friendly nature of its products. With the customer in mind at each stage of the product design, Apple’s products are tailored to be as easy to use as possible, no matter how technologically savvy the customer might be.
With Apple carving this route for its consumers through its products, society is clearly moving toward a direction that is synergizing an advanced technological era with an improved standard of living.
Yes, it is “cool” to own a product by Apple, especially among college kids where self-image and popularity are valued by so many. This in no way, however, indicates that trend has become more important than function when making buying decisions. In fact, Apple’s products gained the label of being trendy only because so many consumers were delighted by the simple and user-friendly nature of its products.
Apple has no inventive formula for success; the company’s strength lies simply in the user experience it provides, and the new iPad is no doubt going to live up to Steve Jobs’ description of it — “magical and revolutionary” — at least that’s what iThink.
Amrita Parekh is a sophomore majoring in psychology and communication.
I bought a Macbook because I felt ostracized here at ‘SC, because like 80% of the people have them, and I felt that I’d look like an outcast without one. I also bought my Macbook (not Pro, couldn’t afford it *sad face*) because the black Macbook (don’t want the ubiquitous white ones) was on sale for $200 off regular price. 
I’m a community college transfer, and boy, I’ve never seen such a display of ostentation (whether direct or indirect) by the laptop one uses. 
…Also, I don’t drive a current model Bimmer. Instead, I drive a reliable 4-cylinder, fuel-sipping, Japanese car.
I don’t let my material possessions define me. I let my character do that instead. zhaaa zhaaaaaaaaa
That would be a strong argument if Apple charged $5-20 for every update.  iPhone owners have never paid for any updates.  I’ve owned one from day one, and I got all of those new features for free, including the best copy/paste out there.  And, since you asked, it took 1 year and 8 months before copy/paste was introduced.  Not bad, seeing as how the vast majority of phones still do not offer it.
If the only reason you bought a Mac is because you want to be cool then you’re an idiot.
What makes MacBooks superior is simply the Operating System; Leopard/Snow Leopard.  The iPad is a joke; it would be endlessly more functional if it was Snow Leopard based as opposed to running on an OS that resembles the iPhone’s.  All this is going to lead to is Apple charging you $5-20 everytime you want to update the inferior OS. How many years did it take them to add copy and paste to the iPhone? LOL….exaaaaactly.

Last week I survived a five-day natural disaster ­— a Southern California natural disaster.
Rain. But not just any rain — this was a storm so mighty, it poured for more than two consecutive hours. I can’t remember that last time that happened in Los Angeles. 
The madness is now over, but it got me thinking about what could have happened if the storm had lasted more than one week. Would USC be prepared to handle a flood, a fire or an earthquake?
The devastating situation in Haiti is motivating Americans, more specifically L.A. residents, to prepare for the major earthquake that is likely to hit soon.
According to Lawford Anderson, a professor of earth sciences, an 8.0-magnitude earthquake, larger than the one that recently devastated Haiti, hits Los Angeles once every 160 years. The last one that hit was in 1860, and Anderson said it’s only a matter of time before another disastrous quake erupts.
In fact, USC recently sent out an e-mail warning students to be aware and get themselves ready for a surprise.
So are we prepared?
According to USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning Specialist Steve Goldfarb, the Department of Public Safety, University Park Health Center, USC Transportation, Hospitality and Housing are all prepared to take immediate action if an emergency were to impact people on campus. These divisions are equipped with access to food, shelter, first aid and transportation should there be a need for it. And the USC Media Relations Office would communicate to students and their parents through the USC website and TrojansAlert to update them on the situation.
In addition, Goldfarb said more than 200 staff and faculty volunteers have been trained to help out during a crisis; for example, conducting search and rescue missions and providing first aid.
USC does makes a significant effort to teach students about earthquakes. For the last two years, USC has carried out official earthquake drill — the ShakeOut — which it heavily advertises through pamphlets, flyers and e-mails.
Unfortunately, that might not be enough, since students still might not know what to do in case of an emergency. I know I don’t.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Although I know a thing or two about earthquakes, having grown up in Los Angeles, when it comes to raging weather conditions, I’m just not ready to deal.
That’s why residential advisers, residential coordinators and area directors are trained in first aid, evaluating emergency situations and evacuation procedures every fall, Goldfarb said in an e-mail. But I’m skeptical about the amount of information that actually sticks with these student support staff members.
For instance, even though the Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning might try to get the word out, my resident adviser admitted to not knowing what to do in the event of a crisis, which made me feel less than safe.
And he’s not alone.
I spoke to R.A.s from several residence halls who mentioned they felt iffy about the emergency procedures they would be expected to carry out and suggested that a midyear refresher would be helpful. While I must give credit to a couple of R.A.s who said they would be able to direct students to the correct locations during a crisis, as a whole I worry for the safety of my peers and for my own well-being.  If my own R.A., who went through training, is unprepared, how does that affect my safety?
Since I’m not sure who knows what, I guess it’s every man for himself during times of crisis. Anderson warned that students’ top priority is to make sure they have enough water and electricity stored and to secure all items on their bookshelves, such as televisions or DVD players, with Velcro to the wall. It’s time for me to do some shopping.
USC has certainly put in the effort to educate students and faculty about safety procedures, and, in case no one was listening, this university has made sure that every R.A. posts a list of safety procedures for different emergencies on their doors. But I’m still not convinced that the information has sunk in yet. (Until an R.A. mentioned it, I had no idea where students should flee during a fire; turns out it’s the parking lot structure nearest my building.)
It’s time to jump on the bandwagon and educate ourselves about USC’s emergency procedures. The big one is going to hit and we need to be ready.
All things considered, I guess it would be wise to study the procedures in my spare time because I can’t trust anyone better than I can trust myself.

It seems even the coaches that predated the Pete Carroll regime at USC aren’t immune from the staff overhaul that has taken place since Lane Kiffin took over as the coach of USC.
On Tuesday, Rocky Seto – who was the Trojans’ defensive coordinator last season – was told that he would not be retained on staff under Kiffin.
Seto began his tenure with USC in 1999, when he was a volunteer assistant under then-head coach Paul Hackett. In his first year, Seto worked mostly with special teams and defense. In Hackett’s final season with the Trojans, Seto began serving the team on a full-time basis, first as an administrative graduate assistant.
When Carroll took over for Hackett in 2001, Seto began working more specifically with the Trojan defense, first working with the team’s safeties, linebackers and finally the secondary as a whole.
After the 2008 season, former defensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian took the position of head coach at Washington and Seto was offered Sarkisian’s old job. Seto was also offered a different position – to coach the secondary of the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – but decided to stay with the Trojans and become defensive coordinator.
Monte Kiffin, Lane’s father and the defensive coordinator at Tennessee before Kiffin left that post, will replace Seto.
Seto is reportedly talking with Carroll about possible positions in the former USC coach’s staff in Seattle with the Seahawks.
Well, Lane.  It looks like you cleaned house and are starting over.
So I have a question, where is this coaching dream team we have been hearing so much about?? All I see is Monte, Ed O, and you are back.  Furthermore, you just hired your whole Tennessee staff.  Is this what you were talking about when you said “we will focus on developing players by bringing in top coaches.”?  I’m confused.

Despite how much less like a sanitary napkin Apple Tablet sounds, a gaunt Steve Jobs announced that Apple’s long-rumored technology wonder-project is officially called the iPad. In an attempt to meet space-starved users’ needs between a laptop and a netbook, the iPad is a tablet computer with capabilities unlike any of its PC predecessors.
At a press event in San Francisco this morning, Jobs showed off the company’s latest mobile device —  a 9.7-inch tablet computer with a full capacitive multi-touch display, 1-GHz speed and up to 64GB of memory. It weighs a mere 1.5 pounds and measures only 0.5 inches thick.
Like a larger, expanded iPhone, the iPad comes with the phone’s recognizable interface (including app compatability), built-in Bluetooth and a near-HD quality screen. The iPad’s most culturally significant selling point, however, is its e-reader capabilities.
Appropriately titled iBook, the iPad’s e-reader is set to revolutionize the way we read the printed word. Apple teamed up with some of the top publishers and have opened up a new nook of Apple’s online retailing where iPad owners can download their favorite bestsellers in full-color (off-white pages, here we come) and read them on realistic, textures pages that are easy to flip through (via the “next picture” swiping gesture for iPhone).
But the iPad’s greatest acheivement is one that just might save the faltering publications industry. A representative for the New York Times joined Jobs on stage this morning and demonstrated the machine’s ability to recreate the look and feel of a newspaper. In addition to this near-perfect mimicry, the virtual newsprint is embedded with links to other stories and playable-on-the-page videos—turning one of the most analog mediums of information dissemination into a refreshingly modern multimedia experience.
With the successes of non-realistic e-readers such as the Kindle, it will be interesting to see how the impressively capable iPad affects the publishing industry. And with a release date set for April (and a lower-than-projected starting cost of $499), we won’t have to wait long.
Clive green sounds like a douche
“This retard above me probably searched ‘Ipad is awesome’, like I did. There’s so many places to troll he picks here. “It’s full of fail”, lmfao, regurgitate everything everyone else said. Not one of your thoughts were actually original. This device has faults, but it’s an exceptional Ebook reader, the best one on the market.”
DISREGARD THAT I LIKE COCK
It might be useful at this point to just scope out a little bit here and get some perspective on things.
I don’t believe that it’s too contentious to assert that Apple have been (and continue to be) an extraordinarily innovative and influential technology company. For a firm that has such a tiny share of the consumer electronics and mobile computing market (in terms of units sold), it has had a disproportionate effect on other, far larger manufacturing and software companies. From the quality of its products’ industrial design and form factor innovations to its consistently excellent GUI experience, Apple has been punching well above its weight for many years now.
Apple is one of the few companies who regularly help to define the direction of computing and consumer electronics, rather than being content to merely follow the ideas of others. It isn’t afraid to take risks. This is of particular significance here, because it’s precisely this kind of pioneering spirit which has been instrumental in driving technology forward. Without the Apples of this world, consumer tech would undoubtedly be a far less exciting and dynamic affair.
In recent years, Apple has enjoyed considerable success with several of its products, despite mixed initial receptions to some of them. While the utility of those products was already well understood however, the iPad enjoys no such similar advantage. With their latest offering, Apple are (whether cannily or otherwise) attempting to invent a new *category* of device – and one which, it seems, has yet to be fully understood by many. Whether this device succeeds or not in its current incarnation, Apple’s bravery should at the very least be recognized and roundly applauded. For, whatever becomes of the iPad, Apple’s attempts at innovation unquestionably drive the rest of the industry to excel.
My personal disappointment with regard to this new device is not that version 1.0 may fail to triumph from the outset, or that the pre-release models appear to lack many features that more established and familiar devices already possess. Rather, I am saddened by the myopic, knee-jerk reactions of the so-called technology pundits and bloggers who seem capable of viewing this new category of device only in terms of what they think they already know. I mean, just stop and consider for a moment: it’s going to be the application software that developers create for the iPad that will ultimately reveal this kind of device’s true potential. And with the exception of Apple itself and a few early pilot demos, we have yet to see ANYTHING running on it which truly leverages the device’s multi-touch capability.
Despite Apple’s truly astonishing track record over the past few years, very few people seem to understand that this device’s successors (whether from Apple or another farsighted innovator) will almost certainly redefine the industry within the next five years. Almost no one seems to have anything to say about the matter.
Well I’ll give you just a few possibilities off the top of my head, and leave it to others to decide whether these have any merit. I am quite certain that more capable and intelligent people than myself – and that would be a LOT of people – could do better. But here we go …
Imagine, if you will, manipulating a three-dimensional molecular model in realtime, and then experimenting with structural changes and (say) chemical properties using just your fingers – collaborating with several of your similarly-equipped colleagues in remote locations as you do so;
Imagine walking around a building construction site, and calling up blueprints on the fly – keyed to your current location; imagine scrubbing back and forth across a timeline of projected construction work, and comparing the model to your immediate surroundings at any point in time … simply by using the gestures of one hand;
Imagine working with fire and rescue services to navigate a smoke-filled building using GPS and compass orientation to find your precise location and direction on the map you’re holding … and then zooming into small details as needed …
imagine allowing a child to navigate a real library by using an interactive map which provides previews of the material within each library section whenever she draws near to that area – a library treasure hunt with multimedia rewards …
Does the current iPad offer these things? And if someone decides to write the software for it?
Above all else, I encourage you simply imagine. Then look again at this new class of device. And this time, look just a little bit more carefully.
So, Retard, it’s the best ebook reader on the market because you have one? Is that how you know?
This retard above me probably searched ‘Ipad is awesome’, like I did.  There’s so many places to troll he picks here. “It’s full of fail”, lmfao, regurgitate everything everyone else said. Not one of your thoughts were actually original.  This device has faults, but it’s an exceptional Ebook reader, the best one on the market.
r u joking?  This device is a fail.
If you’re advocating it’s merits as an e-reader, think again.  One of the best features of an OLED screen is the incredible brightness.  But, even at it’s lowest setting, reading a book on such a screen will eventually set FIRE to your retinas.  This is exactly where (and why) the Kindle prevails.  You say it’s not “realistic,” but I would argue that the virtual ink replicates the experience of reading print WAY better than this garbage.  Amazon didn’t simply forget that color screens exist.  Recall that Amazon became an internet behemoth selling nothing but books.  They did ACTUAL consumer research instead of thinking to themselves “What would Steve Jobs do?” and came out with a product that fits the needs of the niche market of e-readers. If this iTampon gets big in the marketplace, i’ll guarantee you that it wont be for the e-reader side of it…
But that leaves what…A picture frame?
So the equation goes:    iPad = iPhone – Convenient Size – Functionality in it’s class (any other tablet or netbook is MUCH more functional).  Pretty sad there, Cupertino.
[…] we are going to do this. There is a lot of hoo-ha out there right now about the ipad, both good and bad. We are going to make our first ‘game’ with the ipad in mind. Jo and I have had […]
