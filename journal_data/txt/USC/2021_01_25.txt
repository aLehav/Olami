Sports media moves quickly— it’s the nature of sports itself. Every new game, trade or statistic warrants a short attention span. But after this week’s headlines around sexual harassment in baseball, it’s time to reevaluate. I think ESPN’s Jeff Passan said it best on the Jan. 20 episode of the ESPN Daily podcast:
“The consequences of these actions, even though they were four and a half years ago, have the possibility of lasting a lifetime and that to me is the saddest part of all of this,” he said.
Passan, along with fellow journalist Mina Kimes, broke a story detailing explicit photos that New York Mets’ General Manager and former Chicago Cubs Director of Scouting Jared Porter sent to a foreign reporter over the span of several months. Passan was one of the few men in the industry to take a stance beyond just labeling Porter another “bad apple.”
A flurry of disownment and shock followed the story’s breaking — from the swift action of Mets’ owner Steve Cohen to the Cubs maintaining that they never knew of Porter’s transgressions. Unsurprisingly, the only people who reacted differently were the women sports reporters who bravely penned a different narrative — one that said this isn’t new, and Porter isn’t the only one.
Some have come forward with their own stories of sexual harassment, including Brittany Ghirloli of The Athletic, who detailed a Baltimore Orioles player exploiting his inside-scoop ability to lure Ghirloli into an uncomfortable situation. New York Daily News’ Mets beat writer Deesha Thosar wrote in a column of her own about the “complex heartaches involved in being checked out or harassed when I’m just trying to do my job.”
Overall, the story became about how women learned to adapt to avoid suspicion. Sports journalism runs on private relationships and constant correspondence with sources, and that becomes even more difficult when surrounded by predominantly male colleagues who look to use that practice as a way to make unwanted advances. 
I’m writing about this as a woman just breaking into sports reporting. It is dizzying just figuring it out, and Porter’s exposé only makes the field more intimidating and less appetizing for someone in my position. 
I must keep up with a team’s statistics, schedule, injuries, trades, management, coaching staff and history while keeping a smile on my face and maintaining a sense of approachability with sources. Lean too much into it and I’ll be seen as suggestive; on the other hand, if I’m not nice enough, then I am a cold bitch.
I don’t think I am lucky to have avoided walking the tightrope so far — maybe that’s because I’ve barely dipped my toes in the industry. Sure, I could be taking this Porter incident too close to home, but a man doesn’t muster up the audacity to send over 60 lewd texts without an entire culture of tolerance backing such entitlement. 
The worst part about all of this is that male colleagues of the reporter who came forward with Porter’s behavior saw these texts and Porter’s unwarranted advances towards her as chips to cash in — sexual harassment for an inside scoop. This is further proof that it can’t be seen as just an incident. Porter skyrocketed to the top of the field, vouched for by countless men who just last week cleaned their hands by saying “just another schmuck” without reflecting on the structure that got him there. 
Every column written by women this past week should become required reading in every sports newsroom, but we’ve also got to ask ourselves why there has been a lack of men in the field taking as strong a stance. This is not a woman’s issue: this is an issue of workplace safety that, in Passan’s words, can leave scars that last a lifetime. Do I have to wait for suggestive comments or unwarranted advances to give my two cents in the nonstop narrative of abuse for women?
Sports media is saying that women’s voices matter only after extensive evidence of something bad happening. It is saying that men’s unchecked ambition and desire matter more than women’s simple ability to just do their job and follow their passion.
I want to dive into sports, but I don’t think I have the energy to teeter on the tightrope of maintaining cordial relationships through a still deeply sexist and dismissive culture. 
And guess what? It’s not on me to fix it or call out every advancement or suggestion. It’s not on women reporters to fix the good ole boys’ club.  The men in the front offices and in press conferences beside me need to look in the mirror and give a better excuse than “well, that’s just how it is.”

The No. 5 Stanford Cardinal comfortably defeated USC by a score of 86-59 on Sunday afternoon. The Trojans hung around with sophomore guard Haley Jones and company in the first quarter, but a 16-0 Stanford scoring run late in the first half gave the Cardinal a lead they never looked back from. The Stanford scoring run turned the game on its head as USC went from leading 18-15 to trailing 31-18 in a matter of minutes.
The Cardinal started the game slowly but put the game away in the second half. Stanford was looking to avoid its third-straight defeat after a 9-0 start to Pac-12 play and a 12-0 start to the season.
USC took good care of the basketball despite the loss, turning the ball over just eight times compared to Stanford’s 18. The Trojans’ main issue came on the glass, where USC was outrebounded convincingly on both ends of the floor. Stanford brought down 53 rebounds, including 18 on the offensive end. USC, on the other hand, brought down a total of just 22 rebounds, and a mere five on the offensive end.
The Trojans’ inability to limit Stanford’s opportunities on the offensive end was taken advantage of by Cardinal senior guard Kiana Williams and Jones. Williams finished with 16 points, bringing her to a total of 43 points scored in two games against USC this season. Jones finished with a team-high 18 points and 11 rebounds. Jones entered the game ranked third in rebounding and first in field goal percentage in the Pac-12. Jones and Williams were two of four Cardinal players to finish with 12 or more points in the contest.
A bright spot for the Trojans was graduate transfer forward Jordan Sanders, who finished with 12 points and the team’s only blocked shot. Sanders entered the game ranked third in the Pac-12 in three point shooting percentage. Sanders has now scored 10 or more points in 10 of her 12 games this season. 
Sophomore guard Endyia Rogers continued to handle the majority of the scoring load with Sanders, finishing with a team-high 19 points and four rebounds. Rogers has enjoyed an efficient season thus far and entered Sunday’s contest ranked fifth in the conference in scoring, seventh in assists and sixth in field goal percentage.  
Sophomore forward Alissa Pili played just five minutes before leaving the game with an injury in the first quarter. This was Pili’s third appearance this season as she continues to work her way back to Pac-12 freshman of the year-form following a nagging ankle injury. Head Coach Mark Trakh said the severity of the injury is unknown in a postgame statement. The constant lineup changes caused by uncertainty surrounding Pili has left the Trojans unable to settle into a rotation, making it difficult for them to find their groove.
“We have a lot to work on, and we’re still trying to integrate some new players,” Trakh said.
Trakh also suggested that Stanford’s late first quarter run could have been attributed to the blow dealt by Pili’s exit from the game.
“We felt we were playing well when [Pili] was in there,” Trakh said. “We felt there was a letdown when she got hurt.” 
Sophomore center Angel Jackson continued to fill the stat sheet in Pili’s absence. Jackson reached double-digits in scoring for the seventh time this season and was active on the defensive end, picking up four steals, tying her season-high. 
The Trojans struggled to keep up with Stanford’s three-point shooting throughout the game. The Cardinal converted on 10 of 25 attempted threes, while USC knocked down just four of 12 attempts. Ultimately, Stanford scored 30 points from behind the three-point line while USC scored just 12. The 18-point differential in three-point shooting and 10-point differential in second chance points can be identified as two of the main reasons for the Trojans’ struggles in the 27-point loss. A lack of rhythm on offense made it difficult for the Trojans to keep up with Stanford’s high-powered offense. 
“I thought we played well; we started well,” Trakh said. “We stopped moving and got a little stagnant on offense.”
Trakh and the Trojans dropped to 6-7 on the season and 4-6 in conference play after the loss. The loss was USC’s second defeat to Stanford on the season. As a result, the Trojans are still searching for their first win over the Cardinal since 2014.
“We just need to get back to work, get better and get ready for the Arizonas,” Trakh said.
USC returns to action next weekend against Arizona and Arizona State, both of whom beat the Trojans during the first week of conference play earlier this season.

Freshman forward Evan Mobley had 25 points and eight rebounds en route to leading USC to a 76-68 wire-to-wire road victory over Cal Saturday night. 
USC has now won its last six games against the Golden Bears — three in a row at Haas Pavilion. They are also now 10-0 on the season when leading at halftime. 
The Trojans were led by another strong defensive performance, holding Cal to 41% shooting from the field. They also controlled the boards, hustling for 17 offensive rebounds resulting in 16 second-chance points.
After dropping the previous game against Oregon State, USC needed a victory to stay alive in the competitive Pac-12 field. Last week, their Thursday game against Stanford was postponed due to a false positive coronavirus test, putting more pressure on the Trojans to bounce back. 
Head coach Andy Enfield emphasized the importance of coming out strong. 
“This was a big road win for us, coming off a loss. It was important that we got back on the winning track, which we did tonight,” said Enfield in a virtual press conference Saturday. “Our players played exceptionally hard all night and battled through [for] a big road win.”
Led by the outstanding play of Mobley, alongside redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy, USC was able to hang on in a game that saw 20 lead changes and five ties. 
USC blew the doors out starting on a 15-4 run, however, just like in their loss against Oregon State, they struggled the rest of the first half. Marred by six turnovers and multiple scoring droughts, the Bears were able to climb back into the game. 
Cal continued to battle throughout the game and put pressure on USC. The Trojans, however, responded, securing huge offensive rebounds and suffocating the Bears when it counted. In the game’s final six minutes, USC only allowed three field goals.
Still, USC struggled to find baskets late in the game — going five minutes without a single field goal. Sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley pulled through for his team by scoring a much-needed bucket with 1:56 remaining to secure the Trojans’ victory. 
After a quiet game against Oregon State and a sub-par first half, Evan Mobley exploded with 17 points in the second half, keeping the Trojans in control throughout. Enfield highlighted his play and emphasized Evan Mobley’s attack mentality. 
“He made really really strong quick moves and put pressure on the defense. I think you saw an improved Evan Mobley today than he was early in the week,” Enfield said. “He’s getting better and we demanded that of him this week and he responded in a huge way. Very, very proud of Evan … we need him to play like that on a nightly basis for us to be successful.” 
The win, however, was a team effort. 
Eaddy contributed 18 points along with big minutes from sophomore guard Ethan Anderson and sophomore forward Max Agbonkpolo, who played 27 and 16 minutes, respectively. Anderson had 11 points and three assists. Agbonkpolo skied for a key offensive rebound off a missed free throw with a minute left to close out the game. 
“We have to just continue to get good movement, we have to make strong moves and part of that is our skill set,” Enfield said. “Our players have to keep getting better and understand what the defense is trying to do. “I thought we were a little tentative in that stretch at times.” 
The false-positive test last Wednesday put the Trojans in a position where they might have had to quarantine another two weeks, in accordance with NCAA protocols. During a span of games where USC had been playing their best basketball, the mid-season pause could have proven detrimental. 
Enfield, however, said that he did not think the test was positive all along. 
“We thought it was false positive all along because we had had two PCR tests, one before we left on Monday, we had another PCR test on Wednesday, we had four antigen tests and everything was negative and you don’t get COVID just sitting in a hotel,” Enfield said. “It was very disappointing to have a false positive and cost us a game on the road, so we were very frustrated.”
USC will play Oregon State Thursday at the Galen Center. Tip-off is at 2 p.m.

Over 500 refugees in boats escaped to a small village in Lesbos, Greece, in 2019, after fleeing their home-country’s civil war. It was at that village where Michael Cesar, a business administration graduate, said he met university professors, doctors, families with children and many more who needed help with food, shelter and primal resources.  
The lack of resources inspired Cesar and  Rhys Richmond, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, to create Duet in 2019. Duet is a tech nonprofit organization that helps refugees in Lesbos — recently expanded to Athens — while supporting the local economy. The asylum seekers are able to go to local stores to select items they need, such as food, laptops or even guitars, and allow circulation of money within the community.  
Refugees request items on a designated app for members, and donors give money on Duet’s website. After every transaction, a picture posted under the app proves the items were received. Within one year, Duet has helped over 100 refugees with the support of more than 500 donors, according to the organization’s 2019-2020 impact report. 
“[Duet] was in response to sort of the realization that the system of humanitarian aid is broken,” Cesar said. “Humanitarian aid is broken, because it’s filled with donation waste, it’s filled with a lack of autonomy for those in need, and they’re not treated with dignity.” 
People struggle to survive at refugee camps even when aid is sent to them, as many items do not fulfill primal needs and instead amount to waste, Cesar said. Donations like bath bombs, for example, are thrown away because there aren’t any bathtubs at refugee camps.  
“Nobody wants to leave their homes and the people who do end up leaving are the ones who really have to otherwise they’re gonna get killed,” Cesar said. 
The Arab Spring in 2011 sparked a group of pro-democracy movements and spread in the neighboring countries in the Middle East, according to The New York Times. In one of the countries Syria, tensions and demonstrations arose while people advocated for greater freedoms and human rights. The government killed and arrested many protestors and war erupted. Since then, millions of people have crossed the borders in Europe seeking asylum.
Cesar and Richmond founded Duet after traveling to Lesbos as part of their “Innovation in Engineering Design for Global Challenges” class. They gathered a small amount of private funds provided by their class and got a head start for their company. They then gathered a team of USC engineers, designers and interns and built a website in order to digitally host their nonprofit organization.
Richmond said, one of the challenges was getting items to people without using a service such as Amazon since one of Duet’s goals was to support the local community and economy as much as possible. Cesar and Richmond walked into local stores in Lesbos and realized many owners were willing to work with them. So, they began directing store owners who wanted to help toward an online site where they could connect with refugees who needed help. 
Both founders spoke about the importance of transparency. Duet wanted its donors to be able to know when and where the money arrives at its destination.
“We’re getting a lot of feedback that [donors] love that transparency piece where they see the exact item — they see the picture of the item in the store — and then we loop back in with them,”  Richmond said. “The refugees have an option to send an optional pickup photo, or even a thank you note. They see the donors name, and then the country flag, where they’re from.” 
Raghav Maheshwari, who graduated in 2020  and is Duet’s tech lead, reflected on the impact of the organization, remembering when he visited a year later. Maheshwari said people were benefiting from donations, to the extent that some refugees had gotten jobs.  
“It was incredible to sort of see the change over a course of a year,” Maheshwari said. “One young man that we met two years ago, he didn’t speak much English at all and was very shy and quiet. Through Duet we were able to donate a laptop which he used to learn English.” 
While Duet continues to help refugees, the organization has been struggling due to Greece’s implemented lockdown as a result of the pandemic. Now, people are only permitted to go out for specific reasons — such as shopping, visiting the doctor or bank — and can only do so after texting a designated governmental number. Many refugees are unable to do that, so help has been delayed for the moment.
Cesar said the donations are still important so that the refugees can pick up what they need when the country reopens.
In the meantime, Duet is also expanding in helping young parents who come out of foster care in Los Angeles. Cesar said they decided during the pandemic’s lockdown to start helping a group of people in L.A., because it’s their hometown and were able to provide similar help as they’ve been doing it overseas. 
Duet’s future plans include taking this platform and applying it to many other cases, such as incarcerated youth leaving prison, or natural disaster victims whose houses were destroyed. Their goals include a variety of geographical locations, not only within the United States but also in other countries. 
“I think Duet has the power to really change the way that charity works, that philanthropy works, just because it puts so much power in the individual and allows them to feel ‘I am receiving a hand up. I’m not receiving a handout,’” Richmond said.

If you’ve been tracking music charts over the past few years, you’re probably no stranger to Billie Eilish and Rosalía. For two gifted artists with exponentially expansive careers over the past few years, their oppositional styles make them an unlikely duo for collaboration.
But now, they’ve teamed up to create an emotional, heart-thumping, bilingual track for HBO’s hit series “Euphoria.” Accompanied by a mesmerizing, hazy music video, their starkly-contrasting vocals, alternating call-and-response lyrics and dystopian, synthesized instrumentals contribute seamlessly to conveying the agonizing feeling of missing someone who understood but could not forget your inner demons.
Sonically, “Lo Vas a Olvidar” fits right in Eilish’s wheelhouse. Similar to her solo tracks “bad guy” and “Therefore I Am,” her voice feels right at home in the moody, synth-heavy instrumentals. On the other hand, this track’s instrumental structure signifies a departure from singer-songwriter Rosalía’s typical style, who has historically created music in more upbeat, Latin R&B/soul and Flamenco pop genres. However, she’s able to not only bring out her roots in Spanish-speaking music but also showcase a softer, angelic side to her voice.
Nonetheless, the two singers effortlessly blend their styles and effectively create an inky, lonesome, chills-inducing universe within this track. Rosalía debuts the song with clear, celestial vocals, soaring above the deep, pulsing organ-like synth, “Dime si me echas de meno’ aún” (“Tell me you miss me”). As if to respond to the call, Billie echoes a similar line with her own husky, curvy vocals, “Dime si no me perdonas aún” (“Tell me if you still don’t forgive me”). Together, in a sudden crescendo of sky-scraping harmonies, they sing, “¿Qué harás con to’ este veneno? Na’ bueno” (“What will you do with all this poison? Nothing good”). Rosalía closes out the verse alone, repeating her first haunting lyric.
With a rugged synth crescendo, we’re then launched into the heart-pounding chorus. “¿Lo va’ a olvidar?” (“Will you forget it?”), “Can you let it go? Can you let it go?/¿Lo va’ a olvidar? Can you let it go? ¿Lo va’ a olvidar?”, they repeat together as if slowly driving themselves insane from holding out hope. Their vocals spiraling toward the clouded sky as the synths hum under them, the influence of Eilish’s atmospheric musical style becomes more evident in this section of the song.
The track proceeds with muffled speaking from Rosalía, as if she was speaking on the phone: “Ah, besitos, hahaha/Take care please.” Eilish then launches into the next verse, building on the foundation laid in the first: “Dime que no te arrepientes aún” (“Tell me you still don’t regret it”). Rosalía’s heavenly vocals wander in again, “Dime si aún queda algo en común” (“Tell me if there’s still something in common left”). They make one final plea together: “El tiempo que se pierde no vuelve/Dame un beso y bájame de la cru’” (“The time that’s lost doesn’t come back/Give me a kiss and bring me down from the cross”).
Now tentatively expanded, the instrumentals become far more noticeable in this second chorus. As they swoop forward with every beat, they still remain reserved and let the emotion ring clear through the vocals, as if to hesitate in this vulnerable prayer for forgiveness. It’s also quite satisfying hearing both artists settle into their voices more here, as they are able to bring out the song’s emotional desperation and sensuality in their vocals.
Suddenly, the bridge cuts in with autotuned vocalizing from Rosalía. The electric outro begins: “El amor no puede medirse en paso’ firme’/Un día soy un dio’ y al otro puedo partirme” (“Love cannot be measured steadily/One day I am a God and the next I cannot break”). Eilish joins in, this time in English: “I needed to go ‘cause I needed to know you don’t need me/You reap what you sow, but it seems like you don’t even see me.” After Rosalía repeats her outro, Eilish concludes the saga: “You say it to me like it’s something I have any choice in/If I wasn’t important, then why would you waste all your poison?”
It is consistently impressive to watch these two artists continue to grow in their careers. “Euphoria” aside, this collaboration ended up being strikingly raw and mesmerizing. Music situated in TV series is usually hit-or-miss, often creating acute interest without significant longevity. While some may find the instrumental simplicity and slow-paced nature of the song disappointing, it doesn’t need to be more than a piece of art. It may not be the catchiest radio track, but it signifies deep growth in both artists’ careers and more than serves its purpose for the show it accompanies. To see these two artists blend fundamental elements of their current styles together into this carefully crafted and performed track makes this collaboration every bit as powerful as it should be.

When I began drafting out this particular column — initially meant to reflect on my relationship with boba — I found myself wanting to probe deeper into why I wanted to write about arts and entertainment from a Chinese American perspective in the first place. In past installments of “Soft Power,” I’ve attempted to deconstruct and clarify certain dominant ideas about Chinese identity as they manifest in film, food and music. For me, these ideas have shaped my understanding of what it means to be Chinese. 
While reflecting on what new insights I could bring to this column, I realized that I had never questioned why my Chinese identity was so important to me or dissected the connection it has to my love of arts and entertainment. After a thorough examination, the closest answer I arrived at was Chinese television. More specifically, the ways that Chinese television shows have shaped my life as a Chinese American.  
In my household, Chinese television shows aren’t solely an extension of the home, but instead represent who we are. They are realizations of time spent together. They are purposeful representations of the people we choose to talk about, stories we love to watch and the culture we belong to. My affinity with Chinese television shows is an effect of why arts and entertainment are so important to me. Yet, in many ways, they can be seen as the cause as well. 
Growing up, watching Chinese television shows were so much more than a way to “pass time” — they were a way of understanding myself through others. Yes, they gave me many laughs, but they also brought me closer to a language, country and identity that I often questioned my connection to.
Chinese talent shows affirmed my belief that Chinese people were so incredibly brilliant, an idea that went largely overlooked in the popular talent shows I grew up watching. Chinese dramas taught me that being Chinese and being the romantic lead weren’t mutually exclusive. Chinese variety shows highlighted my favorite Chinese foods and showed me that culture wasn’t an intangible commodity, but a familiar and relatable way of living and learning. I learned Mandarin by watching television, and I learned what my Chinese identity meant to me through its representations. 
Sometimes it’s hard to put into words just what my Chinese American identity means to me. Instead of trying to articulate it, though, I think about it in fragments through the ways my family chooses to occupy our time: My father’s avid discussions at the dinner table of his latest Chinese television drama. My mother and I huddled together on the couch, a laptop between us because we want to know who wins China’s “Idol Producer.” My Chinese family in America, laughing at jokes that only Mandarin-speakers will get. Chinese karaoke sessions with the aunties in our neighborhood, where we discuss the Chinese movie celebrities we like over the latest Jay Chou song.
These moments are how I define home. If entertainment reflects how we choose to spend our time, then my consumption of Chinese television shows reflected my desire to understand myself as a Chinese American. In my own way, my response to television was inevitably shaped by my life outside of it. In return, I defined myself as Chinese through the stories and experiences I saw onscreen. 
Even now, though, despite progress in my language abilities, a TV skit in Mandarin could go right over my head. I would feel lost and confused and not really “Chinese” at all. My mother would lean over and translate, and I still wouldn’t really get it. 
Yet, when I look back and think about these moments, I won’t think about the difficulty I had in understanding, but the smile on my mother’s face as she explains. I’ll think about the glow of the television screen. I might not know the words they’re saying. I might not know who the characters are. In those moments, though, I know what home means.

Brian Menendez, also known as Chef Turok, has worn many hats in his life: DJ, chef, writer, baker, owner of Turok’s Cheesecakes. He’s done it all.
Chef Turok’s great talent can be summed up by the origin of his nickname, “Turok,” which was given to him in high school as a nod to his artistic pursuits. He began a career in music when he was 18, at which point his name became Johnny Turok as his own homage to Johnny Carson.
“Once I started working in the kitchen it just progressed into Chef Turok, and I had a catering company called Ready Turok because I was always ready to rock a kitchen or a restaurant right on the spot,” he said.
And that right there is as true a statement as ever: Chef Turok rocks the cheesecake world.
As told by Chef Turok, his cheesecake journey began in his Salvadorian household, watching his mom in the kitchen and experimenting with different ingredients that he found around the house. He then switched paths completely and started DJing and even went on an underground hip-hop tour. On his way back from the tour, he had another desire to change his career path.
“I decided that I was going to take two weeks away from everything to figure out what I really want[ed] to do with my life. Two days after getting back from the tour, I saw a commercial for the Cordon Bleu and it just brought back everything…Within that same week I just enrolled and went right into school,” Chef Turok said.
After finishing culinary school, Chef Turok spent time as a sous chef at various restaurants. Unfortunately, one of these jobs ended with a work-related injury that took him out of the industry for four years. During that time, he decided that if he couldn’t be in the kitchen, he would do the next best thing: eat delicious foods and write about them. Because of the accident, Chef Turok had gained weight, but he says that this was an advantage in food-blogging.
“You can never trust a skinny chef so I thought I was pretty trustworthy with my size,” he said, laughing.
However, this job didn’t pay the bills, so he searched for something else.
Chef Turok contacted a friend who was selling artisanal products at a coffee shop in Boyle Heights and asked if he would sample a cheesecake.
“I told him that I make cheesecakes and if he liked them, he could sell them,” Turok said. “If not then at least I tried. So I took literally the last 50 bucks that I had to get myself to the location and I had him try them. As soon as he bit into it he literally just pointed and said ‘I want that.’ He bought what I had on hand.”
In a stroke of fate, 30 minutes later, the Los Angeles Magazine food writer and taco connoisseur Bill Esparza showed up, tried the cheesecake and also loved it. Two weeks later, Turok’s Cheesecakes was featured in the magazine. Since then, Esparza has invited Chef Turok to all the festivals he has organized.
“It was just the right place at the right time. I couldn’t have asked for anything else. So then I just kept hustling and trying to get into different places and was always on the grind,” Turok said.
The recipe for these now-famous cheesecakes was created when Chef Turok was in a cheesecake-making class at culinary school. Up until that point, he had never baked.In fact, he walked into class that day never having even made a Betty Crocker boxed cake mix. Speaking of that fortuitous day, he said, “I went into the walk-in fridge and I saw they had the tub of mascarpone cheese there, and I asked the instructor, ‘What if I did a cheesecake with this?’’’
After one year of perfecting the recipe, Chef Turok had created his signature cheesecakes.
Unlike traditional cheesecakes which use cream cheese, Turok’s cheesecakes use mascarpone. Mascarpone is commonly said to be an Italian version of cream cheese, but so soft that it can be scooped with a plastic spoon. Although mascarpone is more costly than cream cheese, for Chef Turok its use is justified by the textural difference.
“It literally melts in your mouth as soon as you bite into it. It doesn’t stick to the roof of your mouth like a certain factory does,” he said.
Chef Turok makes his sauces and crust from scratch. Instead of just using graham crackers, he also adds almond meal into the crust to help retain moisture. In other words, as the Turok’s Cheesecakes website says, “this is the best damn cheesecake you’ll ever try.”
Two fan favorites are the sangria cheesecake and the creme brûlée cheesecake. The sangria cheesecake has a tart sauce that is generously poured over a slice, assuring that each bite is coated with the smooth flavor. Where as the sangria cheesecake stands out with contrast in flavor, the crème brûlée cheesecake contrasts in texture. The hard shell is torched in front of the customer’s eyes, and it releases smoke that turns the plating into a show.
Chef Turok creates flavors like these based on what’s in season. He also creates flavors specifically for food festivals such as Bill Esparza’s Taqueando Festival. For example, the aloha kine was developed for a food festival and pays homage to the time Chef Turok lived in Hawaii. The crust uses macadamia nuts and Hawaiian vanilla, and the cheesecake is topped with freeze-dried pineapples and strawberry chips.
Despite these ingenious flavors, Chef Turok has met customers who claim to not like cheesecake. Each time, he makes them a promise and says, “You know what, try it. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to pay for it.” Each time, the customer takes a bite and stops in their tracks, astounded. This is what he finds to be the most rewarding aspect of his business: seeing his customers’ faces the first time they take a bite of one of his cheesecakes.
In an email to the Daily Trojan regarding the pandemic, Chef Turok said he had to close shop for four months for the safety of his family and himself. He reopened in July and partnered with an additional restaurant in Uptown Whittier to carry his cheesecakes. He is taking orders for pickup and delivery, and has implemented precautions to keep his customers safe.
One day, Chef Turok hopes to have a brick-and-mortar shop from which he’d sell his cheesecakes. He also wants to be able to produce enough cheesecakes to not only supply other restaurants, but also to supply cruise ships.
For now, buyers can support Turok’s Cheesecakes by buying them at a variety of restaurants including Holbox in the Mercado La Paloma near USC and Michelin-starred Nick and Stef’s Steakhouse in downtown Los Angeles. In fact, when the owner of Nick and Stef’s first tried Chef Turok’s cheesecakes, according to Turok, he had only one thing to say: “This shit’s fucking good. And I want to sell it.”
Aside from the restaurants that sell Chef Turok’s cheesecake, his delicious creations can also be viewed on Instagram @turokscheesecakes and ordered via his website www.turokscheesecakes.com.

Welcome to a new year and a new semester; only two months have passed since my last column, yet if someone told me November 2020 was a lifetime ago, I would believe them. Political science classes certainly have enough material to go over these last two months — from an insurrection at the United States Capitol to a botched coronavirus response, among countless other things. 
These events demonstrate how the government is not always a form of reliable support. When the government falters, it is the job of nonprofits to step up to the plate. This is why, similar to last semester, I want to continue to spotlight the role of nonprofits at both a local and national level — starting with one of the rare instances of good news this past year: the beginning of distribution for the Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines. To ensure both efficient distribution and public trust in the vaccine, the government must rely on the assistance of local nonprofits.
As of Jan. 11, less than 9 million people in the United States had been vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, far below the original goal of 20 million Americans vaccinated by the end of 2020 set by Operation Warp Speed. 
One reason for this lackluster performance is the minimal federal funding for local health care providers to distribute the vaccine. Local distribution is key to quickly vaccinating hundreds of millions of people, meaning nonprofits must play a logistical role in distribution, especially when it comes to advocating for marginalized communities who may be overlooked in the process.
In Washington D.C., for example, local nonprofit Bread for The City received 400 doses of the Moderna vaccine for distribution for local frontline workers. The nonprofit’s mission is “to “provide food, clothing, medical care, and legal and social services” to low-income communities.  Eventually, they hope to be the primary resource for their communities to get vaccinated, as over 3,000 people visit their clinic every year.  Nonprofits such as Bread for The City fight to get the people vaccinated who, far too often, whether it be because of race or economic status, do not receive the highest priority.  
In Philadelphia, only 40,000 people were vaccinated by the end of the first week of January. At that rate of vaccination, it would take the entire year to vaccinate every person in the city. In response, the local government partnered with the nonprofit Philly Fighting Covid, which will open a mass vaccine clinic in the city’s unused Convention Center. The nonprofit hopes to vaccinate between 1,000 and 4,500 patients every day. 
Nonprofits should not only play a role in distributing the vaccine, but also help to establish trust in skeptical communities. According to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, only 46% of Americans feel comfortable taking the vaccine as soon as they can, an unfortunate statistic when experts believe upwards of 90% of the population need to be vaccinated in order to develop herd immunity against the coronavirus.
Specifically, according to the Nonprofit Quarterly, Black, Native and Latinx Americans might be more hesitant to get vaccinated, a likely consequence considering the long history of racial bias in the medical community.  To address this issue, local nonprofits, which have already built relationships and networks in these communities, are better positioned to develop communication frameworks to address the concerns of local members. 
An important step to build trust is for the nonprofit staff to reflect their clientele. For example, a rural Indiana nonprofit called The Family Health Clinic of Monon serves a clientele that is 52% Latinx. To build trust with clients, the staff not only speaks Spanish, but the board also mirrors its clients and the organization holds events for its local community. Cultural understanding is key to developing trust, something nonprofits often possess over governmental agencies. 
The Chronicle of Philanthropy conducted a preliminary study across Britain, France, Germany and the United States and found that the coronavirus vaccine is more politically charged than past vaccines. With this in mind, it is critical that nonprofits, which often have to remain politically neutral for tax reasons, put full support behind the vaccines to show that taking these vaccines is a matter of health rather than a political statement.
In San Diego, the nonprofit Neighborhood Healthcare recently created a new website and hotline to answer any questions people may have about the coronavirus vaccine. Dr. Jim Schultz, the chief medical officer for Neighborhood Healthcare, explains that the purpose of these tools available to the public is to “emphasize the science behind the vaccine.”
For the distribution of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to be as effective as possible, the government cannot act alone. Instead, it is paramount that nonprofits assist with the logistical distribution of the vaccine, while also using established connections to build trust within local communities. Only with the help of nonprofits can we begin the crucial step of putting this pandemic behind us.

Data is incorporated into every facet of life, from elections and sports to stock management and medical research. It can be used to compare and rate objects, from the acceptance rates of colleges to the followers and net worth of individuals. 
Clive Humbly, British mathematician and Chief Data Scientist of Starcount famously said, “Data is the new oil,” suggesting data is the new essential resource. Furthermore, data science is an incredibly attractive major for employers, as companies believe future success relies on harnessing and manipulating mass amounts of data.
The appeal of data is its connotation of truthfulness, caused by its association to math. There’s a lack of ambiguity to arithmetic, for example — two plus two must equal four and four must be less than five. Considering data turns any amount of information into specific numbers, it applies uniform math principles to measure everything. Oftentimes, data is considered an indisputable argument, a nugget of concentrated certainty. 
However, there is a hidden danger in inputting everything into an Excel spreadsheet. There’s something wrong with taking a tragedy and quantifying it. As data is the art of comparison and valuation, let’s consider two statistics that have been compared frequently — coronavirus deaths in the United States and 9/11 casualties, which are 402,000 and 2,977 people lost, respectively. The number of people lost to COVID-19 is roughly 135 times that lost in 9/11, or equivalent to a 9/11-sized attack every 2.7 days of the past year. 
Perhaps 9/11 feels more tragic because it had an external cause and a discernible organization to blame, while many coronavirus deaths are often the product of mass infrastructural incompetence resulting in a less easily identifiable culprit of responsibility. Although deaths from 9/11 seem to have greater visibility, tragedy from the coronavirus is easily invisible to those who haven’t experienced it directly. With this in mind, it is faulty to compare and quantify the loss of life between both causes. 
Another fault of data is its heavily manipulable nature. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, Black offenders committed 52% of the homicides between 1980 and 2008 while only being 13% of the population. Thirteen out of 52 is a favorite statistic of white supremacists, used to justify police brutality and racial supremacy and portray Black people as criminals by nature. The number is referenced so frequently that it is now considered a numeric hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. 
Technically, the statistic is correct, although, it fails to address the circumstances that caused it: racially targeted policing, institutional discrimination, and poverty, and instead reduces an enormous issue to a single biased number. In fact, a study of Cleveland neighborhoods from 1990 to 2000 found crime to be racially invariant, and instead cited poverty as most substantially correlating with crime rates. Ultimately, decreasing poverty in neighborhoods appears to similarly reduce violent crime in white and Black neighborhoods alike.
Clearly, there are many complications with data, particularly its creation. In her book, Raw Data is an Oxymoron, Lisa Gitelman, a media studies professor at New York University, writes that data is not a natural resource and is instead a cultural one. She remarks that even if data is authentic it can be “cooked,” in its collection and scope. Anyone has the capacity to create data and doctor their findings to their intentions, and they have no obligation to include the context essential to their study. Still, all data is treated identically, like gospel.
In both the 9/11 to coronavirus comparison and Black crime statistics, context is omitted because data can’t capture the same emotion as witnessing a Boeing 767 crash into a building filled with people or the relationship between a Black man and the police in the United States. 
Perhaps there’s no way for people to comprehend tragedy and inequality at such a massive scale, but is data the solution? It certainly has countless uses, but innumerable shades of context are lost when transforming the world into a data set. Some things are unable to be described by a number.
