In 1979, Richard Dekmejian, a professor of political science, traveled to Libya for a conference in observance of the 10th anniversary of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s coup d’etat. Dekmejian said the dictator invited him to speak at the conference and then asked him to write a book about his reign.
“I had written a book called Egypt Under Nasser,” Dekmejian said. “He never read the book and thought it was about Nasser, so he invited me to write a book about him. Of course, I shook my head just so I could get out of Libya. Once I got back to the states, I broke off future communication because I really wasn’t interested in writing a book praising him.”

Qaddafi was not the only ruler to offer Dekmejian a book deal, but there was never any doubt in his mind that turning down each offer was the right thing to do. The son of two Armenian genocide survivors, writing in praise of these rulers contrasted with his own moral values.
“There are a lot of countries on this earth that will give you big money if you deny genocide,” Dekmejian said. “Despite the fact that you can make thousands of dollars, you can’t play that game. Beyond a certain point, you can’t pull punches when someone is really bad.”
Dekmejian was born in Aleppo, Syria, nearly 20 years after the genocide that killed most of his extended family, but his family’s past helped shape his future. He said he and his family were always on the move — refugees being not entirely welcome in Syria — but he eventually moved to America to live with his uncles, where he furthered his education.
He studied engineering and theology for a few years before enlisting in the U.S. Army. Having grown up in Syria at a time when it shifted from French rule to independence, he learned to speak Armenian, Arabic, French, Turkish and English fluently. He was stationed in France, working at the NATO headquarters near Paris.
“The kind of work I did was intelligence work, because of the languages I knew,” Dekmeijian said. “It determined my interest in politics, international relations, intelligence issues and leadership issues.”
After finishing his military service, he returned to school, studying political science at the University of Connecticut, earning a master’s degree at Boston University in Soviet and Asian politics and a doctorate at Columbia University in Middle Eastern politics. He went on to teach at SUNY Binghamton while also working for the U.S. Foreign Service Institute, preparing diplomats to go to the Middle East.
“The work at Foreign Services was incredibly interesting because you’d get to talk to practitioners,” Dekmejian said. “In political sciences, you deal a lot with theoretical stuff. We’re not practitioners, so when you go to the level of practitioners, you learn a great deal.”
Dekmejian came to USC in 1986, and now teaches political science, including a course called Terrorism and Genocide, where he teaches students to recognize preconditions of genocide and how to prevent it. He teaches through case studies of past incidents of terrorism and genocide, but also gives students the opportunity to briefly experience it in class, with the help of former graduate student and U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Ken Graham.
“He comes every year to do a military-style takeover, where a number of students with masks take over the class,” Dekmejian said. “I literally lay on the floor. It’s about a five-minute operation. But then I go through our mistakes in the past and what’s the likelihood of some new forms [of terrorism].”
Dekmejian also worked on documentaries about genocide and terrorism with the Discovery Channel and said it is important to document and learn from these incidents.
“It’s important, I tell my students, to inoculate ourselves with the anti-genocidal vaccine so that we can prevent this from happening as we grow up on this planet,” Dekmejian said. “It’s so important to learn about the tragedies of the past and hope that will teach us something about not doing it in the future.”
Fight On Dek!
@Ergun – It’s ironic to hear you call the Armenian Genocide “a discredited political claim”.  The main reason it is not recognized in most countries is because of the political pressure the current Turkish Government is exherting on the foreign governments due to its leverage as a major political ally in the Middle East.  I suggest you pick up a book from Nobel Prize willing Turkish scholars like Orhan Pamuk who are fighting censorship from a government that is willing to oppress its own people in order to keep all this hidden and hope the people will eventually stop caring.  
But we won’t.  We will continue to teach.  We will continue to tell the stories of our ancestors.  And we will never forget.
1917                 
“…For fourteen days, I followed the Euphrates; it is completely out of the question that I during this time would not have seen at least some of the Armenian corpses, that according to Mrs. Stjernstedt’s statements, should have drifted along the river en masse at that time. A travel companion of mine, Dr. Schacht, was also travelling along the river. He also had nothing to tell when we later met in Baghdad… …In summary, I think that Mrs. Stjernstedt, somewhat uncritically, has accepted the hair-raising stories from more or less biased sources, which formed the basis for her lecture…”

Thank you Ergum, now you can climb back into whatever hole you sick vile genocidal deniers crawl out of anytime any mention of a basic historic fact is made in the media. Your so called historians were all directly paid by the Turkish government and lobby  and they didn’t publish an “open letter”. The publication of the announcement was made as paid advertisement by the Committee of the Turkish Associations. You sick disgusting pathological animals can try to fool the world, but the the whole world will one day know what you did, and we will take back our holy lands that you stole, one way or the other. You can be damn sure of that.
1928                  
“…Few Americans who mourn, and justly, the miseries of the Armenians, are aware that till the rise of nationalistic ambitions, beginning with the ‘seventies, the Armenians were the favored portion of the population of Turkey, or that in the Great War, they traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian invader; that they boasted of having raised an Army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population…”

I took Dr. Dekmejian’s Terrorism & Genocide course when I was a political science student at USC in the late 1980s and I am glad I did.  I will never forget the first day of class when he was introduced as a guest lecturer/terrorist.  The students were in an uproar as he was giving his “lecture” until he finally admitted that he was actually the professor.  Classic.      
There will always be whacko conspiracy theorists who claim that a genocide never happened or “if” it did, it was somehow justified.  It’s important for all of us to be aware that there are pseudo-scientists out there making these claims and doing their best to revise history.  Bravo to Dr. Dekmejian for educating people about these ruthless groups who perpetrate heinous crimes against humanity.
1923                   
 “…In some towns containing ten Armenian houses and thirty Turkish houses, it was reported that 40,000 people were killed, about 10,000 women were taken to the harem, and thousands of children left destitute; and the city university destroyed, and the bishop killed. It is a well- known fact that even in the last war the native Christians, despite the Turkish cautions, armed themselves and fought on the side of the Allies. In these conflicts, they were not idle, but they were well supplied with artillery, machine guns and inflicted heavy losses on their enemies….”

Armenian genocide is a discredietd politcal claim, not a court proven fact.  For scholarly accuracy, one should say “Turkish-Armenian conflict”.  On May 19, 1985, about 70 American scholars published in New York Times and Washington Post an open letter, addressed to the Congress, urging them not to recognize the Armenian claim as the sole truth and nothging but the truth, because the impartial evidence unearthed so far show “…inter-communal warfare fought by Christan and Muslim irregulars…” against a bacdrop of the WWI raging.  Armenian took up arms against their own government, terrorized defenseless Turkish villages, joind the invading enemy armies, and the the Ottoman government moved them out of the frontlines where the war was waging.  This was a defensive measire taken during a wartime.  Genocide claims ignore Turkish suffering at the hands of Armenians and dismisses Armenian revolts, treason, and terrorism, and hence inherently racist and dishonest.
Turks and their backers can twist the events the way they see them fit their own pocket books. Yet the Armenian genocide issue still remains as that; nothing but an attempt to annihilate Christians (whom they until today call non-believers) and Christianity all together. The Ottoman Empire started executing their long term agenda with massacring the nearest Christians to their twisted and war mongering people. When that did not work, they took the easy way out; that is denial and reversal of blame.
1976                     
“… The deafening drumbeat of the propaganda, and the sheer lack of sophistication  in argument which comes from preaching decade after decade to a convinced and
 emotionally committed audience, are the major handicaps of Armenian historiography
 of the diaspora today…”

oops. Meant, professor
Please tell the good doctor not to worry about the book Gaddafi wanted him to write. They are many of us who will take up his slack, myself included. Gaddafi was an awesome man and he will be remembered fondly by millions.  So, take a load off, Orofessor.

Miscellaneous incidents
at 5:44 p.m., a student on Orchard Avenue reported that someone has been dumping garbage on the back porch of her apartment for several weeks and a subsequent investigation by DPS officers revealed that another student who lives in a neighboring apartment was responsible. The officers counseled the student about his behavior and he agreed to stop.
at 11:30 a.m., DPS officers responded to two staff members who reported that they spilled radioactive material on their clothing at the USC Endocrine Laboratory. The staff members changed out of the affected clothing and cleaned up the spill before the officers arrived and a radiation safety specialist who responded to the scene determined that there was no safety hazard. The specialist took custody of the contaminated clothing for disposal and the staff members returned to work.

Undergraduate Student Government Senators approved spring budget allocations and a resolution supporting the University Park Campus Master Plan to renovate the University Village, Tuesday night at the last Senate meeting with legislative business. New USG officers will be sworn in during the final official Senate meeting next Tuesday.
The resolution expresses USG’s full support for the Master Plan and that a majority of students are in favor of the plan, which cites results from a USG poll. The resolution also aims to raise awareness for the plan among the student body. Resolutions communicate the student body’s collective opinion to administrators.
Senate · Vice President Logan Lachman and Vice President-elect Vinnie Prasad listen to discussion of the resolution about the Village at USC. - Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
Of 503 respondents, 89 percent reported supporting or strongly supporting the University Park Campus Master Plan.
The resolution passed with six yeas, zero nays and two abstentions, from Greek Senator Andres Guarnizo-Ospina and Residential Senator Marissa Roy.
“I don’t think the plan protects the people who are already there and a lot of members in my constituency really like the businesses that are in the U.V. right now,” Guarnizo-Ospina said. “I don’t think their interests are being represented fairly.”
USG Vice-President-elect Vinnie Prasad, also a residential senator, sponsored the resolution, which was authored by members of the USG Community Affairs Committee.
“The benefit for the university is this will show, when they go to meetings now and have to talk to [Los Angeles] council and several groups, that the students are behind them on this because I know that has come into question in the past,” Prasad said after the resolution was introduced last week.
Before considering the resolution, the Senate unanimously passed USG’s spring funding allocations. Elton Kwok, USG treasurer, said there were no surprises in the budgeting process for the spring and that the allocation process did not change significantly from the fall.
“There is not really anything out of the ordinary from the fall,” Kwok said. “It was pretty easy to allocate money because people had well-planned events.”
Kwok said more funds, which originate from student fees, were available because more students enrolled for the spring semester.
“We did see an increase in the number of students [who enrolled] in the spring,” Kwok said.
The Senate also unanimously approved the executive officers for the incoming administration. The appointments include Kameron Burk as chief of staff, Kelly Hann as senior director of communications, Jenn Guan as treasurer, Juan Espinoza as executive director of program board and Wing Lee as financial director of program board.
“We were really looking to create the best team and the best group to work together,” USG President-elect Mikey Geragos said. “Looking at certain positions and seeing how we could get better and picking people who would take that next step was important.”
The new executive officers for USG and Program Board were selected by respective advisory boards, both of which included Geragos and Prasad. The incoming officers are currently working to hire committee directors and assistant directors.
“We have an amazing pool of talent in terms of who’s applied and it’s making our lives extremely difficult,” Geragos said. “But that’s a good problem to have.”
So a 503 person sample represents a 15,000+ student population? …Interesting stats.

The Schoen Family gave a $10-million gift on Tuesday that will provide additional financial support to military veteran students studying in the Marshall School of Business and Viterbi School of Engineering.
Veterans · USC trustee William Schoen donated $10 million. - Photo Courtesy of Marshall
The gift will increase the Schoen Family Scholarship Program for Veterans Endowment, which William Schoen, a USC trustee and alumnus (B.S. ’60, MBA ’63) and his wife, Sharon, established in 1986.
“I believe that our veterans deserve an excellent education at an outstanding university,” William Schoen, a U.S. Marine veteran who served in Korea in the 1950s, said in a press release. “Our support for veterans goes back to when I went to USC. The reason that I was able to go to USC was that I applied for a scholastic scholarship and was awarded one.”
The couple has since given a total of $16 million to the endowment, which has benefited 173 military veteran students, totaling $1.2 million.
Karla Leyva, a senior studying accounting and recipient of a full-tuition scholarship from the Schoen Endowment, said that without the scholarship she would not be at USC.
“A big reason why I was able to accept [USC’s admission offer] and come here was because of the scholarship,” said Leyva, a U.S. army veteran who completed two tours in Iraq between 2003 and 2007. “I made it my goal to really do well in my studies so I could qualify for the scholarship and could leave USC without debt.”
Leyva, who transferred from Cerritos College in Norwalk, Calif., said the Schoen family scholarships open up opportunities for veterans.
“[The scholarship] is something that can help out a veteran coming from whatever duty they did in the military,” Leyva said. “It’s a good way to pay homage or give back to the vets who have been fighting for our country to come back and accomplish their academic goals.”
With the $10-million gift, the endowment will double the number of Schoen family scholarships from 15 to 30, which will be available beginning in the fall. Eligible applicants include incoming freshmen, transfer students and continuing undergraduates in Marshall or Viterbi and full-time MBA students. Candidates must have served three continuous years of active duty and have been granted an honorable discharge title.
“The Schoens’ longstanding dedication to our nation’s military veterans will always inspire the USC community,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a press statement. “The Schoens understand that these brave service members have contributed so much to our country’s collective security, and deserve a world-class education — one that matches their world-class courage.”

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, in a discussion with Bob Rasmussen, dean of the Gould School of Law, spoke about his plans and achievements for the city on Tuesday.
Villaraigosa said he intends to shift his focus for the remainder of his time in office to the city’s transportation system, the education system and building connections with the global community. Villaraigosa is ineligible to run for mayor in 2013 because of term limits.
Future · Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa spoke at the Gould School of Law on Monday about his plans to focus on education and transportation for the remainder of his term. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
“We’re trying to accelerate the development of the transportation system from 30 years to 10,” Villaraigosa said.
Los Angeles is looking for cleaner and more advanced technology and is also looking to foreign trade as a means of developing the city’s economy and attracting new businesses.
“We are engaged in an effort to do what we can to bring foreign trade investment to [Los Angeles], and we’re leading the country in exports to China and Asia,” Villaraigosa said.
Villaraigosa said he wished he had invested more time as mayor promoting Los Angeles abroad.
“I would have spent more time traveling around the world,” Villaraigosa said. “L.A. is just starting to understand that it’s a global city, and our connections to India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia -— all of this is our future.”
Villaraigosa also discussed the progress that has been made and strides that have yet to be taken in regard to education.
“If you set high standards, these kids can learn, and I’ve learned that we make too many excuses about factors that make it difficult, but not impossible, for these kids to learn,” Villaraigosa said. “For a long time I challenged this district about the number of kids who were dropping out, and there have been studies done showing that this number is higher than 50 percent, but when I first got here, it was 75 percent.”
Villaraigosa also said there is a need for more teachers, a more enhanced education system and greater investment into the Los Angeles education system.
Other goals for the city include improving the system of overcrowding in California jails, reducing the levels of poverty that currently exist within the city and working on reducing the city’s carbon footprint.
Villaraigosa said he will continue fighting for change, although his term as mayor ends in less than two years.
“In the end, you can’t worry about the press cycle,” Villaraigosa said. “You just got to keep on plugging away and then folks can evaluate what you’ve done once it’s said and done.”

Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, back at practice after missing Saturday to compete in — and win — the long jump at the Trojan Invitational, continued to shine. Lee ran crisp routes, made diving catches and continually shook off defenders with ease in both drills and scrimmaging.
Scrimmage frenzy · Though the list of injuries is still significant, the Trojans’ offense is starting to look comfortable. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“He’s playing every position now. He now has a year of experience under his belt, and has improved every detail of his game, especially becoming a better technician on the field,” wide receiver coach Tee Martin said.
“He’s a really unique individual. Coming out here and running springs, just 48 hours after winning the long jump, he just goes forever,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
ω
While junior Robert Woods is sidelined for spring with an ankle injury, his absence has given other wideouts an extended look. In addition to Lee, redshirt junior wide receiver De’Von Flournoy has been getting additional reps and took advantage of his opportunity, being named player of the day.
Redshirt freshman wideout Victor Blackwell also displayed solid hands in drills, looking like another impressive part of a wide receiver group that is looking to be deeper than initially thought.
Still, the injury bug remains on everyone’s mind. Sophomore wideout George Farmer has been dealing with a hamstring injury all spring and sat out Saturday, participating in some drills but not in the scrimmage.
Throughout practice, Farmer slipped while making cuts and seemed exhausted while participating in one-on-one drills.
“I can run and I can catch, but when I try to be explosive, I’m not that explosive. … I tried to plant my foot and make an exaggerated cut, but couldn’t,” Farmer said.
ω
As for updates on the backup quarterback situation, Kiffin was mum, simply replying “They both do things well,” when asked about the competition between redshirt freshmen Cody Kessler and Max Wittek. There was no discernible favorite on the field either, as each quarterback took their fair share of reps.
Additionally, Kiffin, in his third year at USC, gave an interesting revelation about the goal of spring ball right now.
“[It’s] more about individual and skill set development,” Kiffin said.
This is hopefully a good sign that the team’s cohesiveness is already established to a comfortable level.
After injuring his back on Saturday, redshirt freshman fullback Soma Vainuku was out again.
ω
Additionally, redshirt sophomore tight ends Xavier Grimble (toe) and Randall Telfer (hamstring), redshirt freshman cornerback Ryan Henderson (concussion) and redshirt freshman running back Javorious Allen (hamstring) were out. Senior center Khaled Holmes was limited after not practicing Saturday, not participating in most of the scrimmage.

After helping USC topple its sixth top-10 opponent this year against No. 10 Florida on March 19, senior Daniel Nguyen was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week for his resounding wins in doubles and singles action.
Nguyen began the day alongside USC sophomore Ray Sarmiento on court 2, where the No. 21 duo took an 8-2 doubles victory over Florida’s Tripper Carleton and Spencer Newman, who are ranked No. 26 in doubles.
After helping the No. 1 Trojans earn a 1-0 advantage, Nguyen transitioned to singles action with a faceoff against No. 56 Nassim Slilam on court three.
Slilam managed to take the first set 3-6, but Nguyen, who stands at No. 16 in singles, bounced back in the second set with a 6-4 effort. Nguyen then pulled away with a 10-2 finish in the 10-point tiebreaking set to give USC its final point in the 6-1 victory over Florida.
Nguyen’s ninth consecutive singles win tallied one more to his total of 24 for the season, while the victory in doubles put the pair at 17-4 overall.
After earning the conference honor, Nguyen helped the No. 1 Trojans (19-0) take their 39th consecutive victory in their final nonconference match against No. 42 Boise State Monday with another win in both doubles and singles.
As one of the two seniors on the squad, Nguyen has established a role as one of the leaders for the Trojans this season, who have not lost a match since last February and look to add a fourth straight NCAA title in May.
Nguyen has been a key player in USC’s three consecutive NCAA championships.
In the past two tournaments, Nguyen’s wins in singles play have been the championship clinchers for the Trojans.
This is the third time in his career that Nguyen has been named the Pac-12 Player of the Week.
He is the fifth Trojan to earn the honor this year, joining Sarmiento, senior Steve Johnson and freshmen Roberto Quiroz and Yannick Hanfmann.
Behind the leadership of Nguyen and Johnson, the Trojans will kick off Pac-12 play with a four-game road trip, beginning Friday in Seattle against the No. 22 Huskies.

Sophomore goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai has been named the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week for the first time in her career, averaging 9.7 saves per game in No. 3 USC’s three victories last week for women’s waterpolo. It also marks the first time this season that a USC player has won the award.
Bolonyai matched her career-high of 13 saves in a 9-7 win over No. 4 Arizona State. Eleven of those saves came in the second half, including six in the fourth period when the Sun Devils were held scoreless to clinch the win for the Women of Troy (15-3, 3-1).

The Budapest native also tallied 10 saves in a 7-3 win over Long Beach State and six saves in a 10-5 win over No. 7 Loyola Marymount, including a stop on a five-meter penalty shot. Last year, Bolonyai was honored twice as the MPSF Newcomer of the Week on her way to being named an All-American honorable mention.
Bolonyai looks to continue her stellar play this week, as the Women of Troy host No. 16 Hartwick at 5 p.m. on Wednesday before playing No. 5 California on Saturday at 1 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.

The USC track and field team may have broken records last Saturday, but the season is far from over.
Taking first place in numerous events at USC’s own Trojan Invitational, both the men’s and women’s teams clinched a win that set the standard as the NCAA outdoor track and field season begins.

These victories prove that the outdoor team is capable of going toe-to-toe with top-ranked teams, an important fact considering that the competition will only get tougher as the season continues.
Regardless of the performance that track and field gave on Friday and Saturday, the outdoor season remains unclaimed and USC will again be competing this weekend to test their skills against top-ranked Division I teams.
USC travels south to compete at the annual Texas Relays, held at the University of Texas, Austin.
The four-day event begins today, but the first day features only the heptathlon and decathlon.
The individual and relay events, which USC will be participating in, do not start until Thursday.
Though the name suggests otherwise, the competition does not only consist of relays and will feature numerous individual events in addition to field events.
The meet will feature nationally recognized competition that includes Arkansas, Oregon and Texas A&M.
The Trojans come into the meet ranked 13th nationally; the Women of Troy enter the meet ranked third.
The events held at Texas are the first competition of the official outdoor season for many of the participating teams, and as such represent the beginning of the campaign to achieve ultimate glory at the NCAA outdoor championships.
How the team will perform outdoors has yet to be seen, but there is an even bigger stage that USC (or at least USC’s athletes) will be competing on this summer.
Even if the NCAA finals remain the most immediate goal for the track and field team, the possibility of competing at the 2012 Olympic Games in London motivates the performances of many athletes this season.
“It’s a time when people recognize our sport, a time when our athletes start to receive the most recognition and exposure [referring to the Summer Olympics]. It is a time when people within our sport have an aspiration to not only represent their school, but also to represent their country,” Director of Track and Field Ron Allice said.
After considering the exposure and recognition awarded by of the Olympic games, even the most important NCAA event seems relatively insignificant.
USC has sent numerous Olympians, many of them international, to the games and this year will be no different.
Allice estimates the number of athletes that USC will send to London to be in the “double-digits.”
With the possibility of international glory motivating many athletes, the track and field team will undoubtedly have the championships, as well as the Olympics, on their minds as they seek victory against their opponents Thursday.

Fresh off playing the No. 2 team in the country, USC baseball knows the road to its eventual goal doesn’t get much easier.
Easy, slugger · Sophomore James Roberts and the Trojans travel to Irvine, Calif., to take on the Anteaters, the first in a slew of tough teams left on USC’s schedule. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (14-8) travel to Irvine, Calif., Wednesday to take on UC Irvine (14-8), a team that just missed qualifying for the College World Series in 2011 after losing a heartbreaker to top-ranked Virginia in a super regional playoff.
“We know UC Irvine is a team on the rise and we know how good they are,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “They pitch well, they hit well and they play defense well. We can’t let up one bit.”
USC lost a heartbreaker of its own in the first game of Sunday’s doubleheader with Stanford, but Cruz pointed to the team’s 8-4 win in the series finale as evidence that the team has moved past the dismay of the defeat.
“We’re way past that now,” Cruz said. “I thought it would be a good test for our team to see how we responded to a loss like that, and I was proud of how we did it. We came right back out the very next day and took a game from one of the best teams in the country. Now we just keep moving forward.”
USC could use a momentum-building win over UCI before hitting the meat of its conference schedule. The Trojans are 14-8 overall, but just 1-3 in the Pac-12 to begin the year.
The latter statistic does not, however, reflect the performance of the pitching staff. Starting seniors Andrew Triggs and Ben Mount are 2-3 and 1-3, respectively, but each has a strikeout-to-walk ratio of at least 3:1, with Triggs’ sitting at a pristine 6:1. Meanwhile, freshman left-hander Stephen Tarpley has radically improved his control, posting 40 strikeouts and just nine walks thus far in 2012.
“A lot of [the pitchers’ success] has to do with limiting their workload to a certain extent,” Cruz said.
“One hundred pitches is kind of the bench mark that we like to go by. There’s obviously some leeway, but I think the guys’ arms are still strong because we’re not overworking them.”
Cruz said that Wednesday’s starter against UCI, senior pitcher Brandon Garcia, has a slightly shorter leash because of his presence in the batting lineup on days when he is not throwing. That doesn’t mean Cruz has any less confidence in him, though.
“Brandon’s done a nice job as our middle-of-the-week guy,” Cruz said. “We tend to be a bit more careful with him but for the most part he’s given us what we need in between weekend series. Going up against a good team like Irvine, I’m confident he’ll give us what we need.”
The bats have also been assets for the Trojans, who are hitting .304 as a team. Senior first baseman Matt Foat has set the pace, recording 34 hits in 81 at-bats.
“We’re swinging it well, but we can’t get complacent,” Cruz said. “Not only against Irvine but the rest of our schedule, too. As long as we keep putting up the at-bats we’re putting up, I think we’ll be okay.”
First pitch is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday at UC Irvine.

USC Parking should not have to teach us manners.
I agree with Ms. Sneider’s letter, published March 22. USC parking seems like a horribly lucrative institution at times. However, USC Transportation can make as much money as it wants by enforcing the rule against parking in more than one space.
Parking in more than one space at any time is inconsiderate and self-absorbed. Whether USC students, staff or faculty have paid $8 for the day or over $350 for the semester, they are entitled to park in the first space available in their permitted lot, structure or zone. They should not need to park farther away, or even leave the area to which they are assigned, because someone has parked over the line and blocked two spots. USC’s extremely narrow parking spaces can be addressed elsewhere. Most of us work around these tight spaces, so why can’t you?
Blocking more than one parking space not only deprives a fellow Trojan of a space for which they have paid. It also suggests that the person who has parked sloppily feels that they are more important than the next driver.
You aren’t. If you’re running late to class or work, tough. Rudeness and self-importance on this scale could be fined a lot higher than $50 in the real world. You’d probably get fired.
Take one minute to park graciously and within the regulations of the permit you hold so that others may have the freedom to do the same.
This is a reasonable rule that polite Trojans should follow without being told. I support any penalty USC Transportation wishes to bestow on drivers who block more than one spot.
I would enjoy seeing their cars towed, but that might cause even more congestion.

Senior, history
The last sentence, “Nevertheless . . .” is a typo and was not part of my letter.  Thanks –JS
Good to hear. It was excellent until that sentence. Thanks a lot, editors. “Senators” really needed to be brought into this. So sensible….

The Los Angeles Police Department has a history of struggling with race issues. With events like the 1992 riots, the Rampart scandal and allegations of corruption, the department has suffered major — and often self-inflicted — hits in public perception.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
With each of these incidents, there is a corresponding hit in officers’ credibility. When people automatically distrust the policemen responsible for protecting them, that distrust can only disrupt the police officers’ abilities to do their duties.
This history and these issues come to mind when hearing about the first internal investigation in LAPD’s history, which the Los Angeles Times reported on March 27. The LAPD concluded that one of its officers was engaged in racial profiling. Officer Patrick Smith of the West Traffic Division was found to have targeted Latino drivers in traffic stops over his 15-year career.
This is, however, a different kind of scandal, one that could help the LAPD. It should be taken as an indication that the current LAPD system is not only working but willing to be transparent with the public — a major step toward rebuilding public perception.
The revelation shows a new dedication to addressing racial bias issues directly and publicly.
Yes — by itself, the news is bad. An LAPD officer has been targeting Latinos and altering paperwork to conceal his actions. The investigation confirms what many people already suspect: Racism is still a problem in the LAPD.
The important part of this story, however, is not Smith’s behavior, but rather his department’s behavior. The department is freely admitting that one of its own officers has been engaging in biased policing. It’s certainly not the easiest move on the department’s part, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction.
A Yale study from 2008 stated that the department stopped Latinos and blacks at significantly higher rates than whites, regardless of neighborhood. Another study, conducted two years ago by the Los Angeles Police Commission, found issues in a third of internal investigations conducted by the department.
Through its admission, the department acknowledges that it has had thousands of accusations of racial profiling levied against it and failed to police itself well.
Leading the charge is Chief of Police Charlie Beck. After being appointed to the position in 2009, Beck created a unit that investigates claims of biased policing. His drive against racism spurred the investigation that caught Smith.
In all likelihood there are more cases of this kind of behavior beyond the one centered on Smith — the studies are there and the numbers are hard to argue against. Beck explains, however,  that these can only be isolated cases and projecting the actions of some bad officers onto the entire force is a misguided action.
He’s right: In a force with almost 10,000 officers, there are always going to be some bad apples. It is the responsibility of the department to watch out for them and deal with them accordingly.
The first successful investigation and admission shows that the new system for oversight is doing its job.
Yes, this revelation by the department that racial profiling has been occurring serves as validation to those that have been claiming that this has been happening for a long time.
It also reveals a department committed to fighting these isolated cases and developing a new level of trust with the community.

Man, do I HATE listening to the rants of these good for nothing idealogues!!!
They hold on to the race rant cuz they are simply too afraid to mix in with the rest of us.
Come ON! “WE’RE ALL IN THE SAME SOUP”
You’re suspicions about the Po~lice, whites, the USA, etc. are mostly PARANOIA!
Graduate from that Crap THAT IS HOLDING YOU BACK FROM BEING ONE OF US!!!
Get on with Life already.
GEEEEEEEEEEZ!
Unfortunately, the LAPD patrol officers are ina bind and stuck between a rock and a hard place, so to speak.
When they write tickets for traffice violations, for example, they have to keep a log of the ethnicity of each person they wrote out a ticket for.  Well, if an officer is working the East La area, then most folks will be of Mexican decent. In the South Central part of LA, they’ll be black.  In West LA, they’ll be white, etc…  So, in order not be accuse of profiling the officers “cook the books” and use another ethnic category in order to chow that they are writing tickets on an even distributed basis.  Well, everyone knows that if your name is Hernandez, most likely you’re of Latin decent and not Asian, but the officers are somewhat required to lie on those reports… they get penalized for not being “fair” in their ticket writing.  I think that the whole idea of keeping track of the ethnicity of the violators a patrol office has to write tickets to is in itself racial profiling, and not racial profiling by the police officer.  The folks in the LA City government, who are requiring this sort of information, are the racially insensitive folks themselves.  Unfortunately, in the year 2012, the folks who complain the most about poor race relations, racial profiling and bigotry are, in most cases, the same people doing it.  Sharpton, Jackson, the New Black Panther Party… and their ilk, are all racial bigots with their own personal agenda to stir up the “race pot” in order to gain notoriety, credibility amongst their followers and to support their lifestyle.  their agenda could be best served bringing folks together, not making assumptions about guilt, in the case of Trayvon Martin, or telling a city’s mayor that they’ll burn down the city if he does comsething they don’t like.    
Case in point, why is it that the black community’s, so called leadership, threatens to burn down the town, or does burn down the town and incites riots in their own neighborhoods, when they don’t get their way?
IOn LA, the next race war is forecast to be between the blacks and the Latino population, as there is a lot of hatred between those two groups.  If Villagairosa wasn’t so intent on running for Governor, he’d be out among the city folk working on stemming the tide of the raacial tension in this city.  He is a failure on that mark.

Los Angeles food trucks might not come with suave, sweet-talking waiters or fancy place settings, but these days they are serving up dishes that rival some of the most reputable restaurants.
Sweet treat · Waffles De Liege’s Original Waffle, topped with fruit and chocolate sauce, is an example of the delicious and inventive cuisine that Los Angeles-based food trucks are serving up on sidewalks around the city. - Sara Clayton | Daily Trojan
This food truck revival began in Los Angeles about three years ago due in part to chef Roy Choi, founder of the original — and massively popular — Kogi truck. Choi eventually got past the rough patch of kickstarting the business and now oversees five food trucks and Chego, his first sit-down restaurant in the Palms area.
The success that Choi continues to have with his food-truck empire has inspired many others to try their own hand at mobile gastronomy. And because food trucks in the city run the gamut in flavors and styles, food trucks offer something for everyone.
For the meat lovers, the Grill ‘Em All truck, the season one winner of Food Network’s The Great Food Truck Race, serves juicy seven-ounce burgers that put Burger King’s Whopper to shame. The truck was created by two self-proclaimed “manly men,” Ryan Harkins and Matthew Chernus, who played together in a band before launching Grill ‘Em All. Harkins, having worked in various professional kitchens over the years, decided to tackle something near and dear to his heart: the hamburger.
Since the birth of Grill ‘Em All, Harkins and Chernus have continued to experiment with various flavors and textures, in the process redefining what a burger can be. From duck confit to peanut butter and even cranberry gastrique, there is no ingredient that the Grill ‘Em All truck cannot incorporate into a savory burger.
The Witte, for instance, combines cream cheese, deep-fried bacon and Sriracha onions to make a surprisingly delightful burger. And Grill ‘Em All’s signature burger, the Behemoth, is not for the faint of heart: Not only is there melted cheddar, bacon, beer-soaked onions, pickles and smoky BBQ sauce, meat is tucked between two grilled-cheese sandwiches — that’s two actual sandwiches as buns in addition to the burger itself. It is undeniably overwhelming, but for those with an appetite, the Behemoth makes for an impressively over-the-top treat.
Not into burgers? The Komodo truck makes healthy Asian-fusion tacos and burritos using fresh, vibrant vegetables and fruits. Erwin Tjahyadi, the head chef of Komodo, graduated from Le Cordon Bleu and apprenticed with the legendary Wolfgang Puck. With this rich culinary background, he decided to start up what has now become one of the most popular and talked-about food trucks in Los Angeles.
Komodo’s tacos are known for their wildly inventive and harmonious flavors. Some of their classics include the Komodo 2.0, consisting of seared, tangy top sirloin with mild jalapeno aioli and a refreshing Southwest corn salad. The Asian Marinated Chicken is another favorite, with grilled chicken, faintly sweet stir-fried rice and plump mandarin oranges. And Komodo’s addictive truffle fries — dashed with truffle oil and topped with shaved parmesan — complement any meal from this sleek food truck.
There are also many dessert trucks that really know how to put a sweet end to a meal.
Coolhaus, for example, is a quirky ice cream truck that lets customers customize their own ice cream sandwiches with cookies like Ginger Molasses and ice cream flavors like Candied Bacon and even Peking Duck.
Natasha Case and Freya Estreller, co-founders of Coolhaus, started baking cookies and making ice cream while attending architecture school.
Inspired, they bought a postal truck on Craiglist to distribute their treats and debuted Coolhaus at Coachella in 2009. The truck has attracted a buzz among foodies ever since.
There is no doubting that Coolhaus has a creative concept, but some of it comes off as overly hyped. The difference in some ice cream flavors, for instance, can become hard to differentiate after a while, and the ice cream itself tends to melt quickly. Nonetheless, Coolhaus is worth a try.
Food trucks such as Coolhaus can be found all over Los Angeles, especially in Downtown. Not too far from USC, food trucks meet at the 7th and Figueroa plaza, Monday through Wednesday every week.
If leaving campus is an issue, food trucks can usually be found on Jefferson Blvd. and McClintock Ave. and, as of late, at the United University Church parking lot during weekdays at lunchtime. Various food trucks, including Lee’s Philly, The Grilled Cheese Truck and M.O.E. Eggrolls, rotate frequently around campus.
Many people are still hesitant to try food trucks even though these eateries have come a long way since their notorious “roach coach” days. But take a bite out of a Witte burger or a Komodo 2.0 taco and you will never second-guess a food truck again.

On Thursday, the Interfraternity and Panhellenic councils will once again host Food Truck Wars, a gastronomic event for charity.
Plenty of participants will be there to lend a hand for your gluttonous revelry. Never tried biryani, the classic Indian rice dish, or a key lime cupcake? There’s a chance they could be available on Thursday night with competitors like Bollywood Bites and Sweet E’s Bake Shop.
But let’s be honest: Food trucks are no longer trendy so much as they’re an established part of the Los Angeles dining scene, here to stay for as long as people crave greasy tacos and paper-plated Korean barbecue.
Food trucks line up near University Village daily, and a day rarely goes by without some campus organization bringing a food truck onto Trousdale.
This explosion can get a food columnist thinking: What do food trucks mean to the dining scene today?
Food trucks have birthed what I consider occasional dining — fleeting, hidden or purposely under-publicized experiences.
It makes sense, then, that the most passionate eaters are slowly dismissing food trucks and embracing pop-up dining.
Pop-up restaurants are ventures that usually exist only for short periods of time — sometimes a night, sometimes a week, sometimes a few months — within another restaurant or retail space. And like those ubiquitous food trucks, you never know where or when you might encounter a pop-up restaurant.
In Los Angeles, LudoBites is the most famous of all. Since 2007, the restaurant has been traveling on chef Ludo Lefebvre’s whim: Though it has often been situated in various areas around Los Angeles, the ninth installment just concluded a two-week affair in Hawaii.
If you’ve never heard of pop-up dining and are suspicious of just how in-demand these experiences are, consider this: The seventh incarnation of LudoBites booked all six weeks’ worth of reservations in just 60 seconds.
The overhead and maintenance required to create and run a traditional restaurant — development, rent, management — can be financially and emotionally tolling. It’s why the restaurant industry is often considered among the most difficult to succeed in, and why pop-ups can be appealing alternative to owners.
For the diner, the experience can be more intimate at a pop-up. It’s also a more concentrated celebration of food, with limited, carefully determined menus crafted by chefs for like-minded food enthusiasts. Pop-up dining can also promote the convivial group-dining experience that is often lost in this metropolis.
These are benefits seen at Venice’s Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing, a pop-up located on ever-trendy Abbot-Kinney Boulevard. The menu, in the pop-up tradition, is modified often, depending on what’s available at the day’s markets. In February, the restaurant’s success prompted a six-month extension of its initial six-month contract.
As non-established businesses, pop-up restaurants are also usually unassuming. Downtown’s Le Comptoir, pocketed among the warehouses and colorless office buildings of the Fashion District, doesn’t exactly scream “Come in! We’re open.” In fact, the pop-up operates out of Tiara Café, so you may not realize you’ve arrived at Le Comptoir at all.
Occasional dining exists on a much greater scale as well, far beyond the nomadic kitchens of Venice and tiny havens of Downtown.
One of the nation’s most written-about restaurants, Chicago’s Next, thrives on the concept of impermanence, changing its menu and theme dramatically every few months. The year-old restaurant has already converted itself from a grand Parisian dining experience of 1906 to a “Tour of Thailand” and is now serving a menu of recreated recipes from the late elBulli, the Spanish restaurant considered in its heyday to be the world’s best.
And California chef Thomas Keller even replicated his acclaimed Napa restaurant, The French Laundry — down to its famous blue door — at the massive London department store Harrods in October. For 10 days, London got to taste a bit of the creative Northern California cuisine that has stormed the U.S.: heavy on vegetables, light on seafood, lighter on meat.
Be it from the efforts of a few independent restaurateurs trying to break onto the dining scene or as the product of celebrity chefs with wanderlust, occasional dining marks a new brand of dining elitism. Reservations are exclusive, but so are the restaurants’ lifespans. And the hype is spread through that most fashionable of public relations — word of mouth.
So where better than Los Angeles, with its heightened mix of trendsetters, trend followers, scrappy upstarts and shameless gossips, to serve as a national hub for the pop-up dining movement?
Ironically, if this pop-up trend lasts much longer — likely, as it shows little sign of stopping — it might just go against everything trends and pop-ups stand for and be here to stay.

The Wedding Present has produced yet another brilliant album with Valentina, its eighth studio album in 25 years.
The album is comprised almost exclusively of twisted, distorted love songs that play with the dynamic between hard and soft in both the lyrics and the music. Most of the songs are characterized by abrupt transitions between more punk guitar and drum-heavy sounds to softer, more melodic songwriting. Similarly, the lyrical content fluctuates between bitter hatred caused by toxic relationships and sweeter, more heartfelt cries of love.
Listen up · The Wedding Present offers an alternative sound, different from their previous work but intriguing nonetheless, on its new album. - Photo courtesy of Jessica McMillan
It is an album that immediately grabs the listener’s attention with the first track, “You’re Dead” — an angry, anthemic love song about the dilemma of being unable to quit loving someone you hate.
The album’s opening lyrics, “When you buried your face / Into my chest / Your little hiding place / I would never have guessed / What a little cheat you are / What a liar you turned out to be / How we even got this far / Is a mystery,” instantly give the listener an idea of the themes that will be addressed throughout the album.
Valentina as a whole explores the complex and awkward side of love. Every song is a first-person narrative that acts almost as a personal letter that singer/songwriter David Gedge — the only remaining original member — is directing toward a specific person. Despite this specificity, however, the themes of insecurity, bitterness, resentment and loss in love that the album explores are extremely universal.
Compared to earlier works, like its second album Bizarro, Valentina is much more taut, constrained and concise. The jamming is abbreviated in service of a traditional pop/rock sound but is still laced with occasional experimentation.
This is not surprising coming from someone who has been making music for as long as Gedge. He and The Wedding Present have matured over the years and it shows in the music. Despite this, The Wedding Present’s recent output, and Valentina in particular, still sounds fresh and modern.
Valentina has a very distinct sound as compared to The Wedding Present’s last album, El Rey, from 2008. Where El Rey was largely dark, ominous and heavy, Valentina is lighter and airier, allowing the lyrics to be more easily understood. Through the lyrics here, Gedge appears more heartfelt and honest about his romantic inadequacies than he has in the past.
Gedge plays up the romantic dichotomy between a youthful idealist and an experienced cynic through the album’s 10 tracks. The source of much of the narrator’s pain is his longing for a genuine, loving relationship coupled with his inability to actually obtain one.
Musically, The Wedding Present wears its influences on its sleeve. Drummer Charles Layton seems to have borrowed much from the manic drumroll-laced style of The Undertones’ Billy Doherty. Multiple times across the album, guitarists Gedge and Graeme Ramsay utilize the crystalline and chimey guitar sounds characteristic of The Smiths’ Johnny Marr and Felt’s Maurice Deebank.
The use of non-traditional, more rhythmic jams is also reminiscent of bands like The Feelies. Bassist/vocalist Pepe le Moko, who has apparently escaped from the Casbah, provides a sweet counterpoint to Gedge’s sometimes-rough, sometimes-soulful vocals.
Bottom line: Every song on the album is great — there is no filler. The final song, “Mystery Date,” is an especially strong track that slowly builds in intensity from slow introspection to a rocking, dance-inducing number.
Though Valentina is different from much of The Wedding Present’s past work, there is nothing here to alienate existing fans. Newcomers will also find much to appreciate here and may even consider Valentina a perfect introduction to the band, especially if they’re in the mood for a varied, catchy collection of non-syrupy love songs.
The Wedding Present will be playing The Troubadour on Saturday, March 31, as a part of the 21st anniversary tour for its third album Seamonsters. Valentina was released on Scopitones on March 20.

While the trials and tribulations of academia might not seem like the most enthralling subject in the world, Joseph Cedar’s Footnote makes them just that.
Family drama · Eliezer (Schlomo Bar-Aba), a father and writer, must cope with his son’s success while Eliezer struggles to achieve his goals. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
A sharp and merciless comedy, Footnote centers on the conflict between a father and son’s careers in academia — the father a bitter failure and his son a burgeoning success.
This contrast is emphasized from the film’s first scene, which sets the audience up for a dark comedy that questions the strength of family ties — an intentness that resulted in its nomination for best foreign language film at the 2012 Oscars.
Well-liked son and academic, Uriel Shkolnik has been recently admitted into the Israeli Academy of Sciences. In the moments preceding his speech at the institution’s welcoming ceremony, Uriel waits in the seat next to his sour father, Eliezer. Audiences can see from his trademark scowl that his life has not fulfilled his expectations; he is a man shunned by his colleagues, unrecognized for his minute studies of the Talmud, a Jewish text.
Though they sit so close to one another, the two are living in disparate worlds. The camera holds its focus on Eliezer even as Uriel gives his speech, and the viewer sees the mark of the seething father so used to being passed over. After all, his crowning achievement is having been footnoted, once, in his mentor’s book on Talmudic studies.
This stark contrast between the demeanor of father and son gives the viewer a hint of the tension to ensue.
Eliezer’s dream has always been the Israel Prize, the ultimate recognition of his academic pursuits, a feat he has failed to grasp throughout his career. His dream comes true, but his nomination is more complicated than expected; it is entrenched in the film’s central twist, a twist that polarizes father and son further.
These painstaking twists make Cedar’s film a comedic nightmare; the audience is invested in the stakes of Footnote, yet it cannot help but see the humor in things. Even in this bitter conflict, not everything is tragic. Cedar gives us a silver lining.
The plotlines fall equally between father and son, both with whom the audience can empathize, yet at once the viewer recognizes them as imperfect and even tiresome. The two leads play their roles rightly; they are fully flawed human beings that the viewer cannot help but want to understand.
Not to mention, Footnote  contains a superb cast, offering exceptionally skilled performances. Specifically, in his role as the elder Shkolnik, Shlomo Bar-Aba hardly speaks, proving that actions really can speak louder than words. Even without much to say, the audience gets the full impression of his disappointment and the weight of his demeanor.
As Eliezer’s son, Lior Ashkenazi has a genial presence even while wrestling with the most harrowing ethical dilemma of his life. As a pair, they highlight the parallels and disparities between father and son.
But this film isn’t for everyone. Many viewers may be frustrated by the film’s evasive plot long before its climax. The humor is rather cut and dry though it is thoroughly enjoyable to those who have a more sardonic sense of humor. Meanwhile, those who enjoy a more straightforward, slapstick sense of humor may not find as much appeal in the film’s more acerbic comedic moments.
Furthermore, sound in Footnote becomes almost overwhelming through Amit Poznansky’s grandiose and unnecessarily dramatic score — a bombastic set that sometimes smothers the scenes themselves. Instead of taking away from the film’s subtlety, it would have been more effective to hear music that complemented it instead.
Still, if one can look past these minute flaws, Footnote is an engaging experience.
Besides the contrast between the two Shkolniks, the picture is a contrast in and of itself. The film opens with Poznansky’s dramatic overture, yet it ends with a poignant, dialogue-free sequence. In between, it’s full of playful transitions, frantic subtitles and striking chapter names.
At its heart is conflict — between Uriel and the Israel Prize committee and between father and son. And Cedar’s ambitious stylistic choices supplement an already powerful script.
Astute, comical and deeply sad, Footnote is based on a script that adamantly digs at the rigors and stuffiness of academia. The discord at its core pulls the viewer in, especially with the leads’ expert performances. All in all, Footnote is deserving of its Oscar nod.

Recently Google replaced its old Android Market with the shiny new Google Play. Whereas the old Android Market was centered (obviously) on Android phones, Google Play sits dead-center on the Google toolbar used by PCs and smartphones alike.
The service offers music, movies, books and games in one online marketplace. While obviously somewhat aping iTunes, Google Play differs in one major way from Apple’s mega-lucrative media service: Google Play stores all your media in the cloud, i.e., on the internet, so you never have to download that song or game or book or whatever you want to have. You can simply stream your whatever of choice from the web, without ever properly downloading it to your computer.
Google Play is not the first cloud-based entertainment service. Netflix and Hulu have transformed the entertainment industry with their online subscription-based video-streaming services. With iTunes Cloud, Apple let users sync media across all their newfangled gizmos. Netflix and Hulu, however, have limited themselves to movies and TV shows, and iTunes Cloud does not actually store media in the cloud. Google Play marks the first major attempt at omni-entertainment streamed strictly from the cloud.
iTunes will not be quivering in its boots quite yet. While Google Play talks big (offering “millions of songs and books” and “thousands of movies”), its selection compared to Apple’s is pretty weak, and users who want e-books or movies will more likely turn to a service built specifically for that medium. And competitors can take comfort too in the fact that Google’s ambitious side projects often fizzle. (Who remembers Google Wave?)
But then Google has never been a company one sneezes at. If Google Play gets some traction now, it could become a formative milestone in modern entertainment, the final step away from physically having one’s music toward having a license to hear it.
