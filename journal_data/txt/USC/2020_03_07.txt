To say that Jonah Mathews went out with a bang in his last game at Galen Center would be an understatement.
The senior guard missed a pair of free-throw attempts with 1:41 remaining, but he more than redeemed himself shortly after. Mathews hit a stepback 3-pointer with one second left to seal USC’s 54-52 victory Saturday over crosstown rival UCLA.
“I had a lot of emotion going through my head at that point,” Mathews said. “I made [the shot], my teammates came and swarmed me. The gym was going insane.”
It was the first game-winning 3-pointer for the Trojans since Bennie Boatwright’s deciding shot against Arizona State last season.
“[Head coach Andy Enfield] told me before that free-throw even [happened], ‘I’m putting the ball in your hands, and we’re going to live or die,’” Mathews said. “So I was like, ‘We’re going to live today. We’re going to live and celebrate.’”
Mathews went 5-for-9 from downtown on the game. He reached 247 career 3-pointers, breaking the previous USC record of 245 set by former Trojan Elijah Stewart.
“It’s very fitting that [Mathews] can end his career with the 3-point record [and] a big shot like that that he’ll remember,” Enfield said. “I can’t say enough positives about how he’s developed as a player and what he means to our program.”
Along with Mathews, the Trojans also honored seniors forward Nick Rakocevic and McKay Anderson as well as redshirt senior guards Daniel Utomi and Quinton Adlesh in the pregame Senior Day ceremony.
Rakocevic was quiet in terms of scoring with just 6 points but picked up seven rebounds, adding to his resume as USC’s second all-time leading rebounder.
Although the spotlight was on USC’s graduating class, freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu showed up to play in what may have been his last game at Galen Center, pending a potential NBA Draft declaration. The big man had 16 points, six rebounds and two assists but often struggled to maintain control of the ball, conceding four turnovers on the game.
“UCLA is a really good defensive team … and they [were] shoving [Okongwu] on every possession and grabbing him and pushing him and they tried to keep the ball out of his hands,” Enfield said. “He played a great game [today], had 16 points and he did get 12 shot attempts, but his biggest thing is his turnovers. When he gets pressure, he gets sped up.”
USC’s defense played well in its own right, as the Bruins were held to under 65 points for the first time since their Jan. 19 win over Cal. UCLA’s leading scorer on the game, sophomore forward Cody Riley, had just 13 points.
“We’re playing great defense,” Enfield said. “To hold Arizona to 48 last week, UCLA to 52, Arizona State to 61, we’re a really good defensive team. We’re very tough.”
Offensively, the Trojans remarkably shot 41% from the field, from behind the arc and from the free-throw line. USC was especially outshot from the line, as UCLA made a near-perfect 14 out of its 15 free-throw attempts.
Okongwu struggled to convert on his high-pressure free-throws, missing a pair in the final minute to allow UCLA to gain possession and take a 1-point lead with nine seconds to go.
With the win, the Trojans completed a season sweep of the rival Bruins. Perhaps more importantly, they put a halt to a seven-game UCLA winning streak and ended the Bruins’ hopes of being the No. 1 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas.
USC rose to fourth in the Pac-12 and earned a first-round bye in the upcoming tournament by virtue of the win and a Colorado loss to Utah. USC will start its campaign for a conference tournament title Thursday against Wednesday’s winner of Arizona vs. Washington.
“Our [conference] is very, very deep this year, and anybody can beat you,” Enfield said. “The Pac-12 Tournament is wide open. [The win] means a lot for us … But at the same time, any team can win games in Las Vegas.”

USC’s Pac-12 Tournament ride came to an end in the second round Friday evening when a motivated Trojan team fell short against crosstown rival UCLA, dropping the matchup by a final score of 73-66.
The Trojans dominated patches of the game, taking commanding leads at multiple stages, but the Bruins proved resilient, responding to every one of the Trojans’ runs with one of their own to keep the game close and ultimately pull away late.
Head coach Mark Trakh expressed pride in his team’s performance given the short turnaround following Thursday’s win against Colorado in the first round. 
“Playing as hard as we had to play last night, we ran out of gas a little at the end there,” Trakh said. 
Momentum swung like a pendulum during the contest. USC used an 11-0 run to stun UCLA out of the gate, leading to a 23-12 advantage coming out of the first quarter. 
UCLA responded quickly and effectively, however, opening up the second frame on an 8-0 run before eventually taking a 37-36 lead into the halftime break. 
After being outscored by 12 in the second quarter, the Trojans turned their halftime deficit into a lead after outscoring the Bruins by 7 in the third. 
Unfortunately for USC, the fortune swung back in UCLA’s favor in the final quarter. USC was outscored 27-14 and ultimately lost the game by 7. 
UCLA was led by junior forward Michaela Onyenwere, who finished the evening with a game-high 26 points and 15 rebounds, presenting a big challenge for USC beneath the rim for the entire night. Onyenwere scored 18 of UCLA’s final 29 points.
Onyenwere’s dominance and USC’s fouling issues proved to be too much for Trakh and co. to overcome. Both freshmen guard Endyia Rogers and forward Alissa Pili got into foul trouble early in the game to limit the Trojans’ ability to build upon their early lead. 
Rogers eventually fouled out, leaving the Trojans without their leading scorer for the remaining three minutes of the fourth quarter. She finished the night with 18 points along with five assists. 
When asked about the officiating, which was controversial at times, Rogers was adamant about the importance of staying level-headed. 
“We just have to play through it, stay poised throughout everything and keep hooping,” Rogers said. 
Rogers’ scoring performance marked the 20th time she has scored in double figures in just her first season at USC. 
Along with Rogers, Pili led USC with yet another impressive showing. Despite the early foul trouble, Pili finished the afternoon with 11 points of her own — a solid performance yet a step back from her recent dominant outings. 
The Trojans benefited from strong showings by a pair of veterans. Graduate guard Aliyah Jeune had 11 points in just her second game back after missing time with a knee injury, while senior forward Kayla Overbeck racked up her first double-double of the season with a 12-point and 13-rebound performance. 
The loss moves USC to 17-14 on the season, an encouraging mark considering the team’s slew of injuries and the inexperience within the young team’s regular rotation. 
The Trojans will likely accept an invitation to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament and aim to conclude their season on a positive note. The selection and seeding of the field is expected to be announced before 9 p.m. March 16.
