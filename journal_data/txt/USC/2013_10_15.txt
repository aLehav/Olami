The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted unanimously at their weekly meeting Tuesday night to approve changes to the election code to extend voting for USG elections by an extra day. Rather than starting on Tuesday, as it has in the past, voting in elections will begin on Monday and run through Thursday. The move comes in response to concerns over low voter turnout.
“The hope is that having an additional day of voting will increase student turnout,” said Taylor Rottjakob, co-director of elections and recruitment and the architect of the change in the election rules.
Last year’s election brought 5,631 students to the polls, a 100-ballot increase from the previous year. USC’s total undergraduate population last year was 18,316.
Though changes to the election code are the prerogative of the directors of elections and recruitment, they must be approved by a vote of the Senate. Commuter senators Brett Ressler and Matthew Leiv voiced concerns about having full voting on Monday. An amendment was proposed and ratified that will remove voting booths from Hahn Plaza, the plaza in the center of campus where Tommy Trojan is located, on Monday only.
Hahn Plaza is traditionally where candidates campaign on the final days leading up to the election. The existing election bylaws, however, prohibit candidates from campaigning within 50 feet of a voting booth. Because commuter senators are often off-campus during the weekend, Ressler and Leiv wanted to ensure that candidates for commuter senator would still be able to campaign on Monday, said Olivia Diamond, senior director of communications for USG.
The vote followed presentations by the International Student Assembly on upcoming events they have planned and by External Relations on their recent accomplishments in marketing.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Center on Communication Leadership and Policy hosted a lunch on Tuesday as part of “Wired Women: Bridging the Technology Gap,” a series exploring the opportunities and challenges faced by women in technology.
The panel featured Christine Outram, senior inventionist at Deutsch LA and founder at City Innovation Group; Sophia Viklund, co-founder of backCODE; and Sarah Penna, co-founder and chief creative officer of Big Frame. The lunch discussion was hosted by CCLP director and USC professor Geoffrey Cowan and chaired by CCLP senior fellow, author and journalist, Narda Zacchino.
According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, women represent only 6 percent of the chief executives of the top 100 U.S. tech companies and 22 percent of software engineers.
“Women need to stand up and take a seat at the table,” Penna said. “There is a mental and psychological barrier that a lot of women have. They ask themselves, ‘Do I deserve a seat at the table?’”
Viklund noted that even though greater numbers of women have started entering the field of technology, more women still need to step up.
“It’s like martial arts — sometimes you get hit but what makes a difference is how fast you recover,” Viklund said.
Outram also spoke about the need for women to push forward.
“If you fail the first time, stand up and push forward,” Outram said. “Find another way to get in. Find another company.”
In regards to what people should be doing to help women get leadership positions in media technology, Viklund said there was not one formula for every woman.
“It is important to figure out the best strategies for yourself,” Viklund said. “You should expect career changes at least four or five times in a lifetime. But, the great advantage is that you have a lot of resources on your hands to make it happen for yourself. You have a lot of support — family, societal and public.”
Panelists also spoke about the issue of income inequality in the workplace and urged women in the audience to take part in the discussion.
“If we want to get paid equally, we need to set goals for ourselves,” Outram said. “Know what you are worth and develop a strategy to reach your goal. It’s not just about believing it.”
Many female students said they  found the discussion both helpful and inspiring.
“It’s interesting that the progress of women has been different in different industries,” said Elise Welch, a graduate student in public diplomacy. “It was interesting to hear from women who have succeeded in that area. Though there are still gender biases, I think it’s important for women to overcome their insecurities. Women have to get out there.”
Future lunches in the series will discuss opportunities and challenges encountered by women in sports journalism, photojournalism and punditry.

The USC fluxHome returned home to USC on Monday after it placed 10th overall in the biennial Solar Decathlon competition at the Orange County Great Park in Irvine, Calif.
Teamwork · The USC team provided tours for people who were interested in technical aspects or who admired the layout of the house. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The fluxHome placed first in appliances and third in architecture out of the 19 competing teams. The team also tied for first with all the competitors in the energy balance contest.
The decathlon included teams from around the country, as well as ones from the Czech Technical University in the Czech Republic and the Vienna University of Technology in Austria.
“People at the competition really enjoyed our house. They thought it was really innovative how we had a really big open area inside,” said Alec Chiu, a fifth-year architecture student who worked on the fluxHome.
The fluxHome hosted a dinner for other competitors in the “flux space,” an area located in the middle of the house in front of the kitchen, with a table that could extend from 17 inches to 10 feet. The space was designed to efficiently accommodate many different activities. The entertainment room adjacent to the kitchen was also designed to be adjustable. It featured five chairs and sofas that could be rearranged into 24 different layouts.
“Our house was just different in the sense that all the other schools had big back porches while ours focused on the interior of the house,” Chiu said.
The team tried to create a similar effect to that of a big porch with a skylight above the flux space. Chiu said that many people were impressed with the spacious bathroom, which featured two sinks and a large bathtub and shower.
People also asked a lot of questions about the fluxHome’s “green wall,” a vegetable garden on a wall next to the kitchen. This feature can be seen on several sides of the house, where one wall has mainly edible plants and herbs and another wall toward the front of the house showcases plants native to California.
This was USC’s first year competing in the Solar Decathlon, and team members were generally pleased with their work. Chiu said that many times the fluxHome only differed from other homes in competitions by a few points, and some of those points were simply because of human error. For example, during the hot water test the team was not able to make the water quite hot enough because someone simply forgot to turn on the correct switch.
Project Manager Justin Kang, an alumnus of the School of Architecture, said the home will sit in the south lot at USC until further decisions are made about its future. Currently, the house is split into three pieces, but looking in can provide an accurate sense of what it looked like while at the competition.
During and prior to the competition, many people came out to see the innovative house. Teams at the Solar Decathlon gave tours to those who visited their house, and Chiu said many high school students also visited the fluxHome as part of a homework assignment. The School of Architecture even visited the fluxHome as a field trip, and students wrote essays on the project.
Chiu said they learned that communication was really important when giving tours because some people were interested in technical aspects of the house whereas others simply admired the layout and features of the house. Brian Lee, a junior majoring in business administration, was fascinated by the sustainability of the house, for example.
“Anything toward a green movement I think is a really cool movement just because with all the things that are going on in the world we are just trying to find a way to be environmentally sustainable,” Lee said.
Rachel Martinelli, a first-year graduate student in architecture, used to attend school in Indiana. She said visiting the competition site helped her realize the advantages Southern California has in terms of sustainability.
“Just the mindset of using solar panels is very different because [when] you’re in the Midwest and there’s rain so using solar panels isn’t as common as in California,” Martinelli said. “It’s a very different advantage into sustainable design coming from that sort of environment.”
Chiu said that the team originally planned to donate the fluxHome to a family after their competition, but no final preparations have been made. The fluxHome will continue to sit on the south end of campus until its outcome is decided, something some students hope will come quickly.
“I think the fluxHome is probably a really good idea, but I really don’t like how the debris is still lingering in the sculpture garden,” said Ethan Lillie, a junior majoring in chemical engineering.
Sincere congrats to all involved. Continued success!
I was there checking out all the homes and I must say that I am very proud of USC’s Fluxhome. It was simple, functional and very livable. There’s an almost calm and zen quality to it more than the other homes. Especially love the Japanese soaking tub, totally unexpected. great job guys!

If you asked USC alumnus Daniel Rodriguez how he has accomplished so much after a past that has included drug addiction, homelessness, poverty and a host of other challenges, his answer would be simple.
“Everything that I do, I do because of my grandmother,” Rodriguez said. “I feel like I am validating what she thought of me, the faith that she had in me. I want to inspire others who have suffered similar experiences as I have.”
It is this conviction that has carried 57-year-old Rodriguez through life. After living on Skid Row, being shot seven times and kicking a cocaine habit, Rodriguez graduated from USC and has started several nonprofit foundations.
His early life was riddled with gang-related issues and drug abuse. Rodriguez moved from New York City to Los Angeles in 1979 with just $36, plus the $100 his mother had loaned him. He began his life in Los Angeles on Skid Row, which boasts one of the largest stable homeless population in the United States.
From 1979 to 1991, Rodriguez worked during the day, but at night, he bet on horse races and used his winnings to fuel a cocaine habit. He said his days were dangerous, living moment to moment without security.
“All I did was play the horses, use cocaine and party every night,” Rodriguez said.
After one incident, he spent 30 days in the hospital because of a bullet wound. His drug habit was so bad he was not even aware of the pain of his injuries.
“In 1981, I got shot like seven times,” Rodriguez said, lifting up a sleeve to reveal the scars of a deep bullet wound. “This was my first bullet, broke my arm. But I was fortunate because none of the bullets hit any vital organs, and none of them needed surgery. But some of them are still lodged in my body.”
But Rodriguez received a wake-up call one night in the spring of 1991. Originally from the Dominican Republic, he called home to talk to his grandmother. He quickly learned that his grandmother had died. He said he then made an important decision: to give away all of his drugs to a friend and sign up for the fall semester of Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College.
Even while living on Skid Row, Rodriguez threw himself into his studies.
“I was living in a room,” Rodriguez said. “I would spend 14 hours at school just so I wouldn’t have to go back. I would get there at seven in the morning and leave at seven at night.”
By the time he graduated in 1994, Rodriguez had made the Dean’s Honor List, the President’s List and the Distinguished Students List. He was his class valedictorian and spoke at graduation, but he said he could not find a job.
“Not even as a dishwasher could I get a job,” Rodriguez said. “Even with the degree, I didn’t have the know-how. This is a guy who came from the streets, so I didn’t know how to go about getting a job.”
Without a job or anything to occupy his time, Rodriguez ended up getting arrested for possession of a small amount of cocaine. He was sent to the Drug Court program, which helped him to get the charges dropped. Then, he went back to school. At this point, he was more knowledgeable about the school system and knew what to do in order to transfer to a four-year university. He set his sights on USC, where he continued his studies as a transfer student.
In 1998, while applying for a scholarship, the director of a scholarship noticed Rodriguez was living on Skid Row, and immediately transferred him to Webb Tower. He ended up graduating from USC with honors.
Soon after, he applied and was accepted to the USC School of Social Work, but he was distracted by the sudden death of his brother.
“I was using and drinking again, so eight weeks before I graduated, my supervisor suggested I take a break,” Rodriguez said. “The next fall, I tried to do the year again, but in February I stopped again.”
Struggling with alcohol and drug abuse, Rodriguez officially withdrew from USC and entered a nine-month rehabilitation program. Following rehab, he enrolled in California State University, Los Angeles, and contacted USC about finishing his degree in social work. On March 13, 2011, Rodriguez received his degree from USC.
Today, Rodriguez is working at the Leadership and Empowerment Foundation, which works with at-risk high school students, and is a counselor at the rehabilitation center he visited, where he has started the Hope and Faith Foundation. He created both of these organizations through the School of Social Work with the help of its faculty.
“USC is my family, they treat me well,” Rodriguez said. “USC aided me, assisted me and helped me out when I needed it most. Had it not been for USC, I probably would have ended up dead somewhere, but I knew I had something to prove, and to try for and that was USC. That was the motive that kept me going.”
Rodriguez has recently completed a manuscript of his story, which is currently being sold in the Trade Tech bookstore. He plans on attending the Peoples College of Law in Los Angeles next fall to receive a law degree. After that, he intends to return to the Dominican Republic to participate in politics and make a positive difference in his home country.
“My work is done here, and the kids I’m working with now are going to carry on what I’ve started,” Rodriguez said. “My time left is short, and I’m ready to move on.”
Looking back on his experiences, Rodriguez is eager to acknowledge all that he has accomplished, and the impact he has made in Los Angeles.
“My legacy is that, ‘You can do it,’ and that there is always a way to get out of it,” Rodriguez said. “You cannot make yourself a victim or blame others for what happened to you. I believe that there are only decisions, not wrong or right decisions, but decisions. You make decisions, and you have to live with the consequences.”
Looking back at the trials and tribulations in his life so far, Rodriguez remembered the importance of legacies. Just as he was inspired to work hard because of his grandmother, he hopes that his  own children and grandchildren are inspired as well.
“When my daughter saw me graduate with my bachelor’s degree, she turned her life around,” Rodriguez said. “It makes me believe that my grandkids and great-grandkids are going to go to school. My daughter, who is just eight years old, is already telling me, ‘Dad, I want to be a Trojan.’”
 
I’m usually not one whose heart bleeds. But this story touched me.

Though I have only been an avid follower of USC football since the Pete Carroll era, I am well-versed enough in Trojan lore to know that our lineage of tremendous running backs extends beyond Reggie Bush and LenDale White to Marcus Allen, Anthony Davis, Ricky Bell and Charles White. Before quarterbacks Matt Leinart and Carson Palmer, there were Pat Haden and Paul McDonald, and predating wide receivers Steve Smith and Dwayne Jarrett were Lynn Swann and J.K. McKay.
But the great Trojan teams of the past have always been identified by who the head coach was at the time. The correlation between a great team and an equally great leader seems implicit, and the last time USC hired a head coach whose ability was not up to par, the team suffered.
USC doesn’t need a certain scheme or certain personnel. Recently, too much emphasis has been placed on altering the team’s offensive approach to resemble a spread. It would be great to utilize the hurry-up offense, but running the no-huddle is not a requirement for success. Alabama and Stanford seem to do just fine playing smash-mouth football. At the end of the day, winning only has one direct cause — the coach.
That’s why the search for a new head football coach is so crucial. It will define the trajectory of Trojan football for the next decade.
I don’t know enough about the intricacies of different offensive and defensive sets to recognize from a pure Xs and Os standpoint which candidate is ideal for the position. It doesn’t take a brain surgeon, however, to recognize emotion, intensity and a coach who motivates his players. That’s what interim head coach Ed Orgeron does for the USC team, and that is why he should be made the permanent head coach for USC.
Sure, he might not be the flashy pick. He isn’t a quarterback guru like Jon Gruden, and his team doesn’t consistently light up the scoreboard like Kevin Sumlin’s Texas A&M squad does. He might not have played football at USC like Jack Del Rio or Jeff Fisher, two NFL coaches rumored to be on USC’s shortlist of candidates.
Granted, there are valid criticisms of Orgeron that should be taken into consideration. He failed to win at Ole Miss from 2005 to 2007, and the pressures of meeting expectations at a program of USC’s stature far exceed those in Oxford, Miss.
But Orgeron has that intangible “it” factor that USC needs.
I recall another coach who had a bevy of question marks accompany his arrival when he was hired — Pete Carroll. He wasn’t the boosters’ first choice either, and the biggest knock on him was that he was too much of a rah-rah players’ coach who failed to win in his previous stints. But Carroll had more success at USC than anybody could have predicted. He might have left the cupboard empty with his departure after the 2009 season, with NCAA sanctions looming, but he sure built a powerhouse at the pinnacle of his tenure.
It would be virtually impossible, of course, to bring Carroll back to Troy, but USC has a very realistic candidate who is a near-carbon copy of Carroll — Orgeron.
Like Carroll, Orgeron is a tremendous recruiter. His passion and love for the game seems to leave an indelible impression on every prospect he visits. This isn’t a differentiating factor, though — with the resources and history USC has, any decent coach should be able to recruit five-star talent.
What Orgeron really excels at is crafting a relationship with his players once they arrive on campus. Orgeron possesses an innate ability to motivate and energize his players. For the first time all season against Arizona, there was a palpable level of excitement flowing from the field into the stands. It wasn’t because of a change in personnel, though more players did get in on the action. It was because of Coach O.
Orgeron might not be an offensive mastermind, but neither was Carroll. A top-tier offensive coordinator can handle the offense himself, taking the pressure off Orgeron to manage both the offense and the team as a whole. Orgeron won’t command the type of salary that a big-name coach like Sumlin or Fisher would. That money can be used to hire the best associate coaches to aid in player development. It is no secret that USC floundered near the end of the Carroll era because of a major dropoff in coaching talent. If Orgeron surrounded himself with a dynamic playcaller and elite assistants, USC would soon find itself ascending to glory once again.
In this day and age, the head coach of a marquee program like USC should act more like a CEO than a micromanager. Former head coach Lane Kiffin never really grasped that, and his aloof demeanor overshadowed his impressive football IQ. Orgeron has the charisma and the social skills to be that CEO. He excites the fan base, motivates the players and has made USC football fun again. At the end of the day, a good coach cures all that ails a program. That coach is right under Haden’s nose, and he should remove the interim tag in Orgeron’s title come season’s end.

The headline is delusional, the Guy has now 11-25 as head coach. You he beat Arizona, ARIZONA, not Arizona State, not a relevant team EVER.

With the 2013 season at its midway point, Daily Trojan columnists Will Laws, Nick Selbe, Euno Lee, Nick Burton, Jacob Freedman, Jake Davidson and Luke Holthouse weigh in on USC’s performance thus far.
Shoulder the load · Sophomore running back Tre Madden has been among the Trojans’ most valuable players thus far this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Q: How would you grade the offense’s performance through the first half of the season?
Laws: B-. The stable of running backs — led by redshirt sophomore Tre Madden and freshman Justin Davis — has looked fantastic. Things have improved in the passing game since redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler took over as the full-time starter under center, but the team can still utilize its tight ends far more effectively than they have been.
Lee: C-. Kessler is coming along nicely and is sure to make more strides as the season progresses. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton seems a little more willing to throw the ball downfield with interim head coach Ed Orgeron at the helm. The Trojans also need to make more use of the outside gaps with the runners who can make those cuts and do a better job of getting the slot receivers and tight ends involved. Also — more Justin Davis. One can never have too much of Justin Davis.
 
Q: How would you grade the defense’s performance through the first half of the season?
Burton: B. I would have given them an A before the games against the Arizona schools, but then the defense gave up 612 yards against ASU and 508 against Arizona. That’s more than half of the total yards USC has allowed all season, in just two games. The performance of the secondary at the end of the Arizona game was not just bad, it was flat-out unacceptable.
Laws: B-. The defense started off like gangbusters by leading the nation in sacks for the first few weeks and stopping Boston College tailback Andre Williams in his tracks, but this unit has fallen off considerably. The Trojans have been exposed by competent spread offenses in ASU and Arizona.
 
Q: Who has been the team’s MVP so far?
Burton: Sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams. The fact that he is tied with redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard for the most tackles on the team shows how freakishly athletic and explosive Williams is. Williams also has 3.5 sacks and a team-leading 7.5 tackles for loss.
Davidson: Madden. When healthy, he is a complete back and has been the steadying force on the team. His balance and vision have been the two most impressive attributes so far. In a conference loaded with great tailbacks like Washington’s Bishop Sankey and Arizona’s Ka’Deem Carey, Madden has made a name for himself thus far.
Lee: Madden. He’s an absolute workhorse and can catch the ball out of the backfield or on short routes, and he makes Kessler’s job so much easier.
 
Q: Who has been the most surprising contributor to the Trojans?
Freedman: Redshirt senior linebacker Devon Kennard. Unless you count Davis and freshman safety Su’a Cravens, talented newcomers who many expected to contribute immediately, there have been few surprises so far. We saw in 2011 the talents of Kennard, but defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s 5-2 defensive scheme has unleashed the beast. Kennard is strong, quick and has the handwork to mince opposing linemen to stop run plays and terrorize opposing quarterbacks.
Selbe: Madden has surprised me the most so far. He drew rave reviews from the coaching staff last season before tearing his ACL, and after a long offseason spent rehabilitating and adapting to playing running back, I did not expect him to have anywhere near the season he’s been having. He deserves to be mentioned among the Pac-12’s top playmakers.
 
Q: Who has been the biggest disappointment?
Burton: Redshirt senior cornerback Torin Harris. It’s not really fair to use the word “disappointing,” because I don’t think much was expected of him coming into the season. But his play has been extremely sub-par so far this season, and I feel like almost every time the USC secondary gets burned for a big play, he’s the back in coverage.
Freedman: Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee. The secondary as a whole has underwhelmed considerably, but Lee came into 2013 looking to build on his All-American 2012 campaign. Rather than help lead an inexperienced offense, he’s dropped the ball (literally). The physical talent and ability is still there, but Lee’s preseason goal to not drop any balls has been unfulfilled, to say the least.
 
Q: How would you grade the team’s season thus far?
Laws: C. Before the season started, I expected this team to be 5-1 entering this week’s matchup against Notre Dame. So it’s hard to be too tough on the Trojans. But the way in which each loss came about — one of which featured complete incompetence on offense, the other highlighted the team’s defensive inefficiencies — is what’s truly concerning as USC heads into the brunt of its schedule.
Freedman: C+. The quarterback struggles early on cost USC the game against Washington State, but the team has also struggled with missed tackles, too many penalties and critical dropped passes. The 4-2 record isn’t awful, but the two losses were to less talented squads. USC’s only semi-impressive win was at home against Arizona, a middling Pac-12 team, which means the Trojans receive barely above a passing grade, considering the expectations at USC.

USC continued its preparation for Notre Dame on Tuesday, and the focus was again on getting the USC offensive line ready to take on one of the nation’s top defensive units. Led by defensive linemen Louis Nix III and Stephon Tuitt, the Fighting Irish are among the top 25 teams in the country in stopping the run.
Up in the air · USC junior wide receiver Marqise Lee’s status for Saturday’s game against Notre Dame is questionable. Lee missed the Arizona game after spraining his left knee in USC’s loss to Arizona State. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“They have a very good team,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “They’re well-coached, big and they’re physical.”
Last season, the Trojans failed to score on four consecutive tries from the 1-yard line late in the fourth quarter, in large part because they failed to effectively block Nix and Tuitt.
Notre Dame is attempting to defeat the Trojans in South Bend, Ind. for the first time since 2001.
Best Environments
Orgeron was not willing to dwell too much on his opponent, preferring to keep the focus on his own team.
“We got to do what we can do, and the rest is out of our control,” Orgeron said. “It all depends on how we play. I know we’re playing at their place, but we’ll be ready to play.”
Though he was tight-lipped about Notre Dame’s expected strategy for Saturday’s game, Orgeron was a bit more loquacious when discussing the environment his team will be playing in. South Bend is a notoriously tough place for visiting opponents, and the energy of the home crowd will be amplified with the rival Trojans in town.
“It’s a great place to play,” Orgeron said. “You grew up watching USC-Notre Dame, and you always wanted to be a part of it. It’s a lot, but we got to focus in on us. It’s not about them. It’s about the Trojans.”
Extra motivation 
USC should be focused and motivated to play in its biggest game of the season up until this point without any added inspiration, but the players were given an extra boost on Tuesday with the presence of an unlikely visitor.
Former Baltimore Ravens star linebacker Ray Lewis asked to speak to the Trojans before Tuesday’s practice, and senior running back Silas Redd, a noted fan of Lewis’, left that talk having taken Lewis’ message to heart.
“I don’t think I blinked once while he was talking,” Redd said. “He answered my question about having mental toughness and getting out of bed and doing things that you don’t necessarily want to do. He said [for him], it’s just a choice. He didn’t have much, so he made that choice to get up every morning and do the work.”
One thing Redd was not expecting to do in last week’s 38-31 win over Arizona was lead the team in carries (19) in his first appearance of the season after recovering from a knee injury suffered in the offseason.
“My name was called in that situation, and I was able to deliver,” Redd said. “It was reassuring, a little confidence booster that I can play the game, too. It’s a stable of running backs, and we all can get the job done.”
Finding his stride
One player who is more than happy to have a surplus of weapons in the same backfield is redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, who had one of the best games of his young collegiate career in last week’s win over the Wildcats.
Earlier in the year, amid cries for him to be benched in favor of redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek, Kessler believed that he had not put his best foot forward on the field, but that certainly seems to have changed.
“Ever since that [Boston College] game, I’ve felt 100 percent in control and confident,” Kessler said. “I feel like this is my team.”
Though he was able to get the job done without standout junior wide receiver Marqise Lee last week, Lee’s absence will be felt much more against a tough Notre Dame team on Saturday.
Luckily for Kessler and Trojan fans alike, Lee was at practice today, and Orgeron said he looked “pretty good.” No official word has been given on his status yet, but having Lee participate in practices is definitely an encouraging sign.

A seemingly empty closet and an empty wallet — this is the harsh reality of many a typical college student. A new startup in the works named Forage, though, might be a solution to this ever-present problem.

Created by freshman accounting major Alex Zhang and freshman business administration major Ethan Mezrahi, Forage is an online virtual thrift shop specifically for USC students. It offers the quirky, trendy finds of thrifting without the hassle of rummaging through packed racks looking for that one diamond in the rough. The site launched officially two weeks ago, and Zhang said developments and refinements to the website are ongoing.
Inventory depends entirely on donations, and the goal of the site is to be a medium for USC students to communicate and exchange clothing.
Zhang first came up with the idea through his experiences at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival this past spring. While at the festival, he noticed the various styles of concertgoers.
“While sitting on the grassy slopes listening to The xx, I noticed all the trendy hipsters prancing around and wondered where they all shopped,” Zhang said. “That immediately sparked my interest in forming some sort of answer to this dilemma of being unable to find out the answer.”
And with that train of thought, Forage was born. Zhang realized that his freshman year at USC would be the perfect time and place to carry out his concept of an online virtual thrift shop, as he was joining “such a forward-thinking, innovative community” that could use a site like this on campus.
This “virtual thrift shop” concept sat on the backburner until he met Mezrahi at orientation over the summer. As members of the Marshall School of Business, the two connected over their interest in business, and Zhang knew Mezrahi would be a valuable addition to the Forage team.
“Ethan has turned out to be one of the most persistent and tenacious people I know. I knew that as my business partner, if he wanted to get something done, he would be able to accomplish it,” Zhang said.
Similarly, Mezrahi saw great promise in working on this project with Zhang a friend he met at orientation.
“Alex is a fantastic partner. He is incredibly innovative, but knows the quality of teamwork, which is key in creating a startup,” Mezrahi said.
Together, the two made this concept a reality shortly following move-in day. Through countless hours of decision-making, the website was up and running. In the process, Zhang and Mezrahi decided that though it was important to create a convenient, user-friendly company, they wanted to use Forage as an opportunity to give back to the community.
“We decided that social change was to be our eternal focus with a more personalized form of charity,” Zhang said. “Forage will allow the user who wants to be a part of something greater than themselves actually see and sympathize with those who they are donating to.”
Currently, they are on the lookout for a local nonprofit to partner with. Their plan is to donate a portion of the proceeds from their site to whomever they choose as a way of giving back to the community that so actively helps to keep their project running.
Zhang and Mezrahi are hoping to find a nonprofit that is their philanthropic counterpart whose main focus is providing clothes to the less fortunate — something like Planet Aid, but smaller so that they could see the tangible impact of their efforts.
Though the project is still in the beginning stages, as it has only been up and running for about a month, Forage’s short-term progress has been tremendous. The team is currently gathering inventory that they frequently upload to their website, and they have gone to various sororities advertising the website with donation boxes for each house.
“Reaching out to the Greek community has been a great help in getting our name out there,” Mezrahi said. “We want the Forage community to grow and span across campus.”
For students who are interested, there are many ways to get involved. For starters, sort through that closet for an underappreciated dress, or those too-small shorts that you forgot to return in time. Forage depends on students’ donations and participation. The site will be having on campus donation centers set up every few weeks so that students can bring their clothes as well as pick up new pieces for their wardrobes.

Coming just 13 months after last September’s The Carpenter, the eighth full-length album by The Avett Brothers, Magpie and the Dandelion, sounds surprisingly different from its predecessor and touches on directly contrasting themes. Though The Carpenter was in many ways a rumination on mortality and growing old, defined by lyrics such as, “When the black cloak drags upon the ground, I’ll be ready to surrender … / If I live the life I’m given, I won’t be scared to die,” the Rick Rubin-produced Magpie is essentially a celebration of youthful wonder.
Fine and dandy · Magpie and the Dandelion, the Avett Brothers’ follow up to 2012’s The Carpenters, takes on a more optimistic tone. – Photo courtesy of American Recordings
Not only can the thematic polarity be heard in the lyrics of the two albums, but also in the music itself: The Carpenter is split between confident, almost jittery rock and soft, timid acoustic songs, echoing every person’s simultaneous passion for life and fear of death, but Magpie and the Dandelion tends toward a fuller, more boisterous sound consistent with youth and enthusiasm. Most of the bluegrass instruments that take the spotlight one at a time in similar bands’ music come all at once in a flurry in Magpie, banjos competing with guitar competing with Bob Crawford’s double bass and Joe Kwon’s deep cello, giving the album a sound that is lively without ever sounding busy. Over it all, Seth and Scott Avett’s unmistakable vocals, unpretentious and clear, complete the burst of twang and emotion that is The Avett Brothers’ music. Fundamentally, the majority of the North Carolina-based brothers’ newest record falls somewhere in between their last album’s punchy alt-country and acoustic Americana folk; full-band ballads abound, complete with twangy banjos and a ragtime-esque piano. Tracks such as “Apart From Me” bring the album down from its energetic roots-rock highs to that soft place where the Brothers do so well.
The album opens strong with “Open Ended Life,” a celebration of the wandering soul that’s colored by fits of bluegrassy strings and a wailing harmonica, and will hold any listener’s attention through the sincere ballads “Morning Song” and “Never Been Alive.” Though similar musically, the two songs are different enough content-wise to remain interesting: the former a melancholy goodbye to someone who “stopped caring,” the latter a hopeful tune about feeling alive and not needing material wealth. Unfortunately, Magpie begins to lose steam after its spunky fourth track, “Another Is Waiting,” and starts to sound a little more like what it actually is: a collection of backup songs recorded during the session with Rubin that created The Carpenter. Just because Magpie contains some second-class songs, though, doesn’t mean it fizzles completely after its more engaging tracks. The powerful, piano-driven “Vanity” turns halfway through from ballad to surprising metal-esque rock, and “Skin and Bones” is the sort of eager, twangy alt-country that fans have come to expect and appreciate from the Avetts, defined by its punchy drums and spirited banjo plucking. Magpie might not be as memorable as The Carpenter, but it still has a lot to offer.
Lyrically, the album falters as its celebration of youth and love falls victim to cliched sentimentality. The otherwise beautiful “Bring Your Love to Me,” for instance, is marred by cheesy lyrics such as, “Bring your love to me / I will hold it like a newborn child / One of my own blood / And I might just even sing a song to keep it calm.” Though Magpie’s love songs such as this one might capture the heart musically, they lack the introspective emotional depth of previous albums and, as a result, end up sounding empty and ordinary. There are still glimpses of the Brothers’ adroit songwriting, however, found in lines such as, “And most of us out there got fooled as the gold, it glittered in the night / And we chased it fast like drunk buffoons / The banker lived, the artist died,” a self-aware commentary on the greed that often strangles the art.
The album is filled out by four demo tracks of other songs off the album, adding to the feeling that Magpie is a half-baked album composed of extra songs from The Carpenter session. In short, the album is instrumentally impressive but underwhelming in comparison to its preceding album, stumbling lyrically into tame, cliched territory. This is not to say, however, that Avett Brothers fans will not thoroughly enjoy the album and that The Avett Brothers are not still an exemplary testament to the possibilities of contemporary folk rock and alt-roots. Rather, Magpie is simply a slightly forgettable addition to the Brothers’ quality repertoire, and music lovers looking for an example of the band’s true potential should look to another album.

I like Neon Tommy. I really do.
I’ve admired its coverage (often jealously) for its originality, depth and thoroughness. During the mayoral election, the digital publication, housed in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, produced several interesting and important stories. And when I wrote for Neon Tommy, I always received thoughtful, critical and valuable feedback from my editors. Neon Tommy has gained a well-deserved reputation throughout the city as a trusted news source, a notoriety that is particularly impressive for an emerging publication.
But as an editor and reporter for the Daily Trojan for the past year and a half, Neon Tommy has also been a cause of constant frustration.
This festering irritation reached its peak Monday while I was waiting in line for a cup of coffee. I was reading a brief Neon Tommy had just posted on Twitter about sanctions USC imposed on The Row after eight people were transported in ambulances last weekend, a story I’d been helping to report for our paper.
Much of the original story was not sourced and the parts that were relied on unnamed sources with little or no information about the sources’ identities. Moreover, the lede, unattributed, seemed to seriously conflate correlation and causation. And when the official statements emerged later that evening, this proved to be the case.
One might say that with an attribution such as “a few sources and Facebook friends,” it should have been hard to take the report credibly. Still, waiting in line for my coffee, I was ready to chuck my phone at the cash register. I was fuming.
Again, Neon Tommy had been first to post original reporting about a USC-related news story, but one that was seemingly based more on hearsay than credible information. Some might wonder why I find it fair to devote an entire column to just one story, but it’s indicative of a larger trend.
Most everything Neon Tommy posted yesterday, we at the Daily Trojan had on background from multiple sources early that morning. But, given the sensitivity of the story, we held back until we had sources willing to go on the record.
When I replied to Neon Tommy’s original tweet asking if the publication had any official USC sources, this was the response: “@danielrothberg: other media outlets are working on the story as well, our sources are confidential. Thanks for the tweet!”
No answer to my question, of course, since Neon Tommy’s sources were confidential, which, of course, journalism typically avoids because it prompts questions such as the one I asked. But to not even identify the confidential sources by an informational descriptor, such as “USC officials,” is an entirely different thing.
“Facebook friends” could be anyone. “Sources” could be anyone.
Again, I want to repeat the sentiment at top. I like Neon Tommy. I really do. And what I like most of all about Neon Tommy is that it gives the Daily Trojan a competitor. And in my opinion, a competitor only makes both publications better. There is a lot the Daily Trojan does wrong that Neon Tommy does right, especially when it comes to online production and utilizing emerging communication technologies. And there is plenty to criticize about the Daily Trojan; I often think we would benefit from a public editor of our own.
But, from time to time, it’s unnerving to compete with an organization that is so motivated by a web-first mentality that, in order to be first, it is willing to rely on unconfirmed information from unnamed, unidentifiable sources.
It should be noted that Neon Tommy was aware of some of the flaws in its story, as the post was tweaked and edited until an entirely different post was published later that day. In addition to changing the sourcing, Neon Tommy changed the name of the Kappa Sigma fraternity after incorrectly referring to it “Sigma Kappa,” a sorority that has no chapter at USC.
Yet, readers would never know that from the post, as there is no editor’s note providing information about what has been corrected or changed, something industry standards would call for.
The Society of Professional Journalists, in its Code of Ethics, calls for news organizations to “admit mistakes and correct them promptly.” The New York Times, for example, makes it policy to correct online content at the end of each post and list the revised posts on its corrections page.
One of the larger revisions was removing a photo of a Loyola Marymount University student, who is reportedly in critical condition after falling off a table at a Sigma Alpha Epsilon party last week. Though Neon Tommy felt comfortable naming the student, including a photo of her and citing one of her social media accounts, its sources for identifying her appeared to have no authority or official capacity to do so. At one point during the day, the post simply cited her “Facebook friends” and “various campus sources.”
Were these “Facebook friends” at the party with her? What kind of campus sources? Campus sources from LMU or USC? Students or faculty? And how were these campus sources able to confirm that it had been her at the party?
After all, representatives from the Los Angles Police Department, USC’s Dept. of Public Safety and California Hospital told the Daily Trojan they were unable to release or confirm her identity.
Later, Neon Tommy replaced the victim’s photo and removed the link to her social media. No note was ever made denoting these removals or the other revisions in the story. The only addendum to the post reads: “*This is an updated version from an earlier report.”
Perhaps what’s most unnerving is that this occurs in a publication that, unlike the Daily Trojan, gets its oversight directly from USC’s school of journalism.
I understand that Neon Tommy is part of a learning process and mistakes are to be expected, as is the case with any publication. Yet, there is no learning and no process if mistakes aren’t contemplated, acknowledged and, well, learned from.
It’s good to be confident, and criticism alone should never serve as the litmus test for backpedaling from a report. But when an update or revision is made, it should be noted. When journalists make mistakes, they run corrections (or, in serious cases, retractions). They don’t bury the truth, an effort that runs completely contrary to the endeavor of journalism in the first place.
I thought about not writing this column, given the increasingly aggressive (and completely out-of-line) critiques that commenters have posted on Neon Tommy’s coverage.
But then I saw that Neon Tommy tweeted this late Monday night: “CBS News credits @neontommy for breaking the story on LMU student seriously injured at #USC Frat Row party cbsloc.al/1bT2GID.”
And I wanted to throw my phone against the wall all over again.

Daniel.  This is a rather exceptional and emotional eruption.  You have embarked on an obsessive nit picking adventure to no visible good end.  The underlying issue here is if Neon Tommy did or did not provide the public with accurate or with misleading facts.  The weight of the evidence is on the side of Neon Tommy even if one accepts all of your nit pick criticisms.  So what’s the point?  By your own words you express both envy and jealousy. — two unhealthy emotions.   Is Neon Tommy perfect? I don’t think so. Neither is the DT and if someone sat down to catalogue it’s history of errors, flaws, omissions and submissions to USC authority by the DT it might be a lifetime task.  You are too smart a fellow, I think, to throw mud balls like this. Take a shower and get back to some real work. You are saying much more about yourself than about Neon Tommy in this rant of yours.
Daniel, this article is thoughtful, well-written and touches on the issue that I have found, over my years as a student at USC, to be the most fundamental problem with Neon Tommy. I agree with everything you have articulated in this article, except for one thing: Neon Tommy is NOT, and should not be considered, competition for the Daily Trojan. It is not a newspaper, it is not journalism; it is essentially a blog with the journalistic sensitivity of Perez Hilton. Quite frankly it’s insulting that Annenberg considers this their “voice of digital news.” I get that that’s their whole appeal: it’s digital, it’s quick, it’s like twitter. But despite how popular this type of “journalism” is becoming in our society, it will never substitute for real, quality journalism, which is what the Daily Trojan has proven itself to be. It has nothing to do with the digital versus print thing; no matter what media you use to issue news, if you call yourself a NEWS SOURCE and desire to be taken more seriously than Miley Cyrus at the VMAs, you need to be accountable for providing ACTUAL, credible information with sources, ESPECIALLY when dealing with an issue as sensitive as the recent hospitalization of students partying on the Row. Is Neon Tommy serious? Linking to the facebook page and showing the picture of a girl who has been hospitalized as a result of partying, without even a sliver of consideration for the consequences of this blatant invasion of privacy, puts their level of journalistic credibility and quality on par with that of Ann Coulter. The fact that Neon Tommy is even considered among the USC community as an alternative to the Daily Trojan makes me lose faith in people’s ability to distinguish between what is good news and what is straight-up garbage. No doubt there are talented individuals who work at Neon Tommy, but when Neon Tommy gets credit for being the first to break a news story WITHOUT ACTUALLY WRITING A COMPLETE STORY, it is reminiscent of the sad fact that people look to Fox News for “news.” The thing we have to remember is that Neon Tommy is able to break “news” so quickly for the exact same reason we should not rely on them for quality news: They do not do actual reporting. They rehash, repeat, and jump to conclusions. In the words of Nick Miller, we might say they “mamabird” the news. Of course it’s easy to get articles up quickly if you aren’t actually doing the digging around and reporting that a real paper does. But, look, Neon Tommy isn’t even trying to be a real newspaper. Let’s all stop pretending that they’re on par with the DT. To Daniel and all the people who work at at the DT, you should be proud of the work you do and the product you create every day. It’s maddening as hell that you don’t get more credit, but don’t even think for one second that Neon Tommy is your competition.
Thus continues the never-ending war between traditional journalism and digital journalism. No matter how you spin it, the issue is a double-edged sword. Obviously every publication wants to be the first to break the story, some are just willing to sacrifice responsible reporting for speed.
The Neon Tommy article may not have been grossly inaccurate in recounting the facts, but it’s clear that they don’t care about reporting responsibly. To respond to Jay below, journalists are supposed to follow a very particular code of ethics. Part of that code is reporting in a way that does not cause unnecessary turmoil to society or mislead the public. The girl’s identity was being kept private to try to protect her from any backlash she might encounter from being blamed for row sanctions. The original NT article also implied that the girl’s injury was the sole cause of the sanctions, when in fact the University has been several weeks in making this decision according to members of IFC. 
It’s perfectly understandable for Marc Cooper to defend his publication–although he did it in such a condescending tone that I wonder if he really gets Daniel’s points–but it demonstrates that Cooper is a particular kind of journalist: one for whom the details of the story come secondary to breaking the headline.
Given my personal experiences working with both publications, I’ve come to expect the worst from both the Daily Trojan and Neon Tommy. However, this op-ed only confirms that out of the two, the DT is the worst student news publications at USC and in, dare I say, the nation. 
This is petty and unnecessary, reflecting poorly upon not only the writer, but the entire paper and its staff. Rothberg obviously doesn’t understand the spirit and true nature or journalism.
Boo you Daily Trojan for making an unnecessary contest and publishing such a horribly emotionally-driven (rather than facts, ironically) article. Not that I like NT, but if I ever need campus related info, I’ll be sure to go there instead.
Stick to the DPS roundups. Its all you’re good for.
Dear Daniel,
I’m sorry to be responding to your article so late but I have been en route to the Online News Association convention in Atlanta and couldn’t get to this right away.
First of all, thank you for your initial kind words about Neon Tommy.  We are proud of reporting that has won more than 35 SPJ and Los Angeles Press Club Awards in just the last three years. 
As the Director of Annenberg Digital News, the publisher of Neon Tommy, the buck stops with me. My student staff and contributors are welcome to respond to your piece as they wish, but please consider this, if you will, our official response. 
You raise serious allegations about the ethics and integrity of the reporting my staff conducted on the incidents that took place at The Row this past weekend and I feel obligated to give you a serious response. 
Your primary allegation seems to be that Neon Tommy published an article with dubious and undisclosed sources. In my capacity as director of ADN, and relying on 46 years of national and international journalism experience, I personally vetted the article in question. It is absolutely true that the sourcing on the piece was primarily anonymous and unspecific and I understand why you may not be comfortable with that. After careful probing of my reporters prior to posting, I was 100 percent satisfied that the information we had was correct. And it was. So while you were not in a position to evaluate the credibility of our confidential sources, I was. Given my decades of experience, I fully understand the risk of publishing anything that relies primarily on anonymous sources. In this case, I was very comfortable taking that risk because there was no risk. Through various sources, not just Facebook as you suggest, I knew that our reporters were on solid ground.  If not, we would not have posted when we did.
Certainly, a viewer can decide whether he or she is going to trust any piece of information regardless of the cited sources. We need go no further than the run-up to the war in Iraq to see how some of the most prestigious publications in United States where misled deliberately by officially cited sources that were blatantly lying.
You also affirm that changes to the content of the story were made and not disclosed fully to the public. Daniel, one of the great innovations of reporting on the live web is that it is live. It is not static like a newspaper. It is common and ethical practice to “build out” a story on the web as it is developing. We posted only information of which we were sure. As more information was gathered we most certainly made minor tweaks here and there including some grammatical changes. It is also true that it is common web practice to footnote or disclose at the bottom of an article any significant changes that were made from one version to another in published content. We stated very clearly that we had updated the original version of the piece and when we published a second version of it some hours later we linked back to the original versions so one could see exactly how the story had evolved over several hours. 
I made the decision that swapping out one photo for another or de-linking  from the subject’s Vine account were not significant enough to merit a detailed explanation. The basic facts of the story never changed. Our reporting was accurate from the onset. Yes we did transpose the name of the fraternity which you have noted and that is something that I consider to be a minor issue that does not reflect on the general integrity of the article.  
Daniel, you state that at the time of our publication some seven or eight hours before that of the Daily Trojan your news team had most of the information if not all the information that we had at time of our initial post. Your decision to not publish that information because you could not confirm it was the correct decision. But we could confirm it and that’s why we published. 
Indeed, while you state you were waiting for USC officials and different law enforcement agencies to confirm the facts for you, our reporters worked all of that evening to track down friends and family and eventually the father of the young lady who was at the center of the article with whom they spoke directly. After that conversation, we published another follow-up piece quoting the father directly and reconfirming all the information we originally went with earlier in the day.
I am going to politely disagree with your assertion that good journalism shuns the use of anonymous sources. History proves that to be completely wrong. If journalists sat around and waited for officials to confirm controversial events we would’ve never heard of My Lai, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate and assuredly nothing about the vast NSA surveillance program.
In my classes I teach students how to cultivate confidential sources so that reporting can go beyond the surface and not just rely on what are often the misleading bromides or outright lies of authorities who are too often more interested in protecting their power and privilege rather than serving the public interest.
We appreciate and applaud the fact that the Daily Trojan is a USC-centric publication. We think, in general, you are in a better position to report on campus related events than we are. When you do a great job of reporting on events at USC we are neither envious nor jealous. Indeed, we are pleased.  It was Jeff Jarvis of CUNY who coined the motto we adhere to: “Do What You do Best and Link to the Rest.”  We are very happy to direct readers to your fine reporting (or anybody else’s) on this or that event when we cannot adequately cover it. By doing so, we have more resources to concentrate on stories that we can do better.  That is what modern, collaborative journalism should look like. 
That said, the most disturbing part of your essay is your assertion that Neon Tommy provides competition for the Daily Trojan. We do not see the world of journalism that way. Journalism has been evolving into a universe of networked and interlinked media and users in which the old notion of the scoop or some sort of walled-off exclusivity has been overcome, fortunately, by an understanding that all of us, together, including those formerly known as the audience, can cooperate to generate the greatest amount of reliable content.
As the media outlets of the USC Annenberg School get ready for the transition to a new building and a new curriculum next fall, we are working feverishly to collaborate more closely with each other, sharing our content and resources and converging our newsrooms We invite the Daily Trojan to join us in this collaborative effort.

Can DT stop the whining and move on to the next story?
I understand your main points and that this is more about journalism ethics than a personal attack. However, I think to publicly call out a fellow Trojan newspaper is uncalled for. Like Alan said, we are all in this together. I get you wanted to make your voice heard by leveraging a public platform but it just seems catty. If you really had a problem with it you should have emailed the supervisors.
When is USC going to ban tables?  They present a significant safety hazard to my daughter’s well-being as a USC student.
I don’t understand. So you’re mad about accurate coverage that resulted in the University taking action to regulate parties? A girl was seriously injured and your issue is with NeonTommy?
Where’s your head at boy?
I don’t believe that you have an argument on the links to social media platforms. Anybody can look them up; including friends, family, employers and news media. Yes, this may can cause repercussions for the individual because she was identified, but it is not the responsibility of anyone to protect her anonymity. According to released reports, she was not the victim of someone else’s intentional harm. If you think the information was superfluous to the report then say that. 
Additionally, Neon Tommy has ever right to withhold their sources. Journalists do this all time to prevent backlash for their sources. Yes, it is always ideal for people to speak on the record,we both know that anyone Greek member who gave information by name would face severe repercussions. So is the answer to only use the released information? Absolutely not. If journalists did this, the public would never know the truth. If you question the journalistic integrity of Neon Tommy to find reliable sources, then come out in say it. Obviously, enough people trust them if network news station are looking to them for answers.
 And to turn the tables, who did you get the official letter from? You just said that the Daily Trojan obtained it. Let’s see transparency on both sides. 
Frankly, you sound more angry that Neon Tommy beat you on your own turf. It would have been beneficial for you to get the scoop on your own campus, but you win some, lose others. It just wasn’t your day. On to the next one.
F.Y.I.  Your rant about their article is probably getting them more views and getting people off your page.
Thanks for your thoughtful critique, Daniel. We miss your excellent work at Neon Tommy. One question, what exactly was inaccurate about any of our coverage? My advice: let’s bury any differences we may have about Rules of Attribution, and together challenge the school administration, students, Greek Row and others to deal with realities of campus life in 2013. For example, wouldn’t you rather have had classes disrupted by boisterous tailgates than force all the pregaming to the Row?   We are in it together, whether at the outstanding Daily Trojan or equally outstanding Neon Tommy, and shouldnt let Nikias et al off the hook Let’s talk more over coffee. We miss you. .
Well written and articulate, Daniel, as always.
Good article.  
The neon T. article was a joke.  They used “Facebook” posts as a source, I mean come on..

Imagine Daniel Radcliffe playing a shy young man from a broken home: His hair is long and shaggy, glasses swallow his face and he wears a brooding expression as he pursues an education on a beautiful gothic campus. At least on the surface, the parallels between Radcliffe’s depiction of Allen Ginsberg in John Krokidas’ big screen debut Kill Your Darlings and Radcliffe’s most well-known character, Harry Potter, are hard to ignore. Yet, somehow, Radcliffe seamlessly steps into Ginsberg’s shoes, and once the theater goes dark, any Potter comparisons are immediately forgotten in this intense and culturally significant new film.
Potter no longer · Daniel Radcliffe (right) stars as Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darlings, a film about the early stages of the beat movement. – Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
At home in Paterson, N.J., quiet Ginsberg must deal with a mentally unstable mother and an apathetic father. His timidity accompanies him to Columbia University, where he is struck by the university’s stuffiness, as well as its radical thinkers — embodied by the subversive and charming Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan). The two explore New York City’s bohemian scene, where Ginsberg meets William Borroughs (Ben Foster), Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), all of whom are Carr’s friends.
The group establishes a would-be literary movement called “The New Vision,” which rejects bourgeois conventions by focusing on uninhibited self expression, and is in many ways an antecedent to the beat movement. The work of W.B. Yeats, whose book, A Vision, inspired the group’s name, provides a backdrop to their collective quest of self discovery. The group galivants through the city, partying, listening to jazz and generally comporting themselves in the same frenzied manner Kerouac describes in his novels without actually writing anything.
Portraying the beat lifestyle is so difficult because it’s virtually impossible to depict its spontaneity and groundlessness within the structure of a film. Krokidas, however, valiantly strives to portray the group’s quest for uninhibited expression, particularly in his use of innovative cinematic techniques to capture their Benzedrine-fueled exploits. Fast motion shots, as well as an incredible scene in which everyone in a jazz club freezes in time, allow the viewer to experience their trips.
Krokidas makes it clear from the outset that World War II and its cultural ramifications are essential ingredients to the characters’ alienation. At one point Carr muses, “We’re sending millions to Europe to fight the fascists, but they’re all here.” The film, however, does not portray their rejection of convention in a one-sided light. In fact, Carr and Ginsberg can seem just as out of touch as the adults they resent. Their highly traditional professor helps contextualize their rebellion by asking them, “You want life? You want the world on fire? The war awaits.”
Sexuality, particularly in such a repressive cultural climate, also contributes to the group’s rejection of the status quo. At first, Ginsberg is very careful to hide his homosexuality. When Lucien reveals that Kammerer is “a f-cking queer,” Ginsberg responds, “Let’s get rid of him.” This eerie and self-hating foreshadowing makes the terrifying struggle of a young gay man in the 1940s come alive. Contemporary popular media is full of sexuality complicating friendships. Yet this film is boundary-breaking in that these difficult-to-define relationships are among men. In fact, all potential female love interests in the film function as stepping stones toward a larger goal; they are not the goals themselves, even for the characters interested in women.
Krokidas emphasizes that this is not just a film about the gay experience. It is a film about a group of young men -— some of whom are gay — struggling to grow and develop in an intellectually and sexually oppressive environment. This matter-of-fact perspective on homosexuality is indicative of its acceptance in mainstream culture. Not every film about LGBT people has to be a message movie.
As in its portrayal of homosexuality, the film also distances itself from over-the-top beat archetypes, largely thanks to its fabulous acting. The characters collectively embody the fact that the term beat refers to a general state of non-conformity, rather than some sort of monolithic movement. The only character that sometimes falls into that trap is Kerouac, who is portrayed by the British actor Jack Huston of Boardwalk Empire fame. Huston can’t quite capture the icon’s all-American gravitas, or his internal struggle between freedom and guilt. In Huston’s defense, there’s a reason there has never been a successful film adaptation of Kerouac’s novels.
The plot of the film exposes the viewer to the sort of uncensored content Ginsberg and his friends wanted to bring into the open. The most heightened moment of the film — a montage of three scenes — embodies this uncensored spirit. Kerouac and his girlfriend Edie have just made up and are the picture of domestic bliss. The real turmoil of their relationship is illustrated by the juxtaposition of Carr stabbing Krammerer. The third scene poignantly depicts Ginsberg losing his virginity. The rhythm of his lover’s passion matches that of Carr’s knife.
Kill Your Darlings’ climax lives up to the film’s sophisticated take on the beat lifestyle. The film strives to make this group of extraordinary young men and their era emotionally accessible to modern viewers. It succeeds handily, thanks to both the actors’ (Radcliffe in particular) and filmmakers’ willingness to stray from convention — just like the beats did.

When the hip-hop world had lost its Eazy-E, Nate Dogg and Tupac, many fans famously declared that old school hip-hop had lost its generation one OGs. On Oct. 12th, however, at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre in Irvine, Calif., the West proved them wrong.
On Saturday night, a lineup of OG rappers banded together for the How the West Was Won concert. The amphitheatre became the stage for rappers such as Kurupt, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg, who stunned the crowd with their glowing talent and incredible ability to spin the clock’s ticking hand to the late ’90s, when the West Coast had practically baked in the hip-hop spotlight.
Rapper Xzibit opened the show by telling everyone to get on their feet, phones out and video recorders ready. Xzibit began his set by taking it all the way back to his 1996 debut album, At the Speed of Life, spitting verses from one of his most famed singles, “Paparazzi.” Ending his performance with his most notorious single, “X,” Xzibit got the audience jumping.
Next up was Kurupt with his Dogg Pound rapping out songs, dedicated to his good friend, the late Nate Dogg. “XXplosive” and “Let’s Get High” really hit the crowd, who was already fired up with various colors of smoke floating in the air. Perhaps one of the greatest aspects of the show was its unchallenging respect and worship to the late rappers who had taught the performers how to climb on top in the competitive music industry. Almost every rapper who took the stage throughout the show alluded to one inspiration who had helped him through the years.
Not failing in this promise was newly signed Cash Money rapper, The Game. The Game was up next with his lively voice and appeal to the younger crowd, who had grown up witnessing his long feud with G-Unit. In good humor and high spirits, The Game brought his eldest son, Harlem Taylor, out on stage to introduce the little guy to the bold crowd. The most shocking moment in The Game’s performance came when he brought out Tyga, Ty Dolla Sign and Clyde Carson to give The Game a chain, welcoming him to their label. The idea of announcing this news on stage was clearly a wise choice, as the crowd went crazy over the press release.
Amidst the fiery crowd and the thousands of fans pleading for the real West Coast rap scene came Ice Cube, the King of the West Coast, blasting his hits “Check Yo Self,” “We Be Clubbin’” and finally “It Was a Good Day.” Not only was Ice Cube a sensational performer but also a rapper who exceeded the expectations of many. In a concert where many West Coast rappers were ready to blow away the crowd, Ice Cube did it best. Of all the performances, Ice Cube was the first to fully put the phenomenal venue to good use. With a projector casting an image of Ice with a golden crown on his head, the audience knew the King of the West laid down the songs that practically spelled out the West.
Nonetheless, even after Ice Cube gave the crowd a chill, there was an anxious and impatient feeling rising in the air. Many were freezing in the cold, October night, tired from hours of dancing and anticipating the long line of traffic awaiting them after the concert. They were all awaiting one person. The first name under the concert lineup — the one and only king of the Dogg Pound. Undoubtedly, no show can lay low without the Doggfather. Closing the show was the most anticipated rapper, Snoop Dogg. While the disc jockey mixed several Nate Dogg classics, a fiery torch rose on stage and the lights began to glimmer. At that moment, the crowd went mad.
Arriving on stage with a sip, Snoop immediately began spitting out his infamous single, “Gin and Juice.” Taking regular smoke breaks, Snoop expressed his laidback persona, making everyone in the crowd much more comfortable and relaxed. The highlight of the night came when Snoop called Warren G to the stage to help him perform one of the West Coast’s most defining tracks, “Regulate” — a hit that conveyed all that the West Coast scene was like over the years. The self-proclaimed player then went on to rap about the ladies. Finally, after track after track of legendary rap songs, a familiar note shocked the crowd. “The Next Episode” came on, and you could almost hear the heels and sneakers hit the ground as thousands of Snoop’s biggest fans heard their favorite single blast the speakers. Interestingly enough, the crowd began to fade away towards the end of Snoop’s performance due to the typical Southern Californian attitude of wanting to beat the traffic. But besides that, Snoop’s performance was the grand finale to a night worth reliving.
All in all, the concert was divided into a few segments. The minority consisted of weak performances from low-name rappers who the majority of the crowd had never heard of. Nevertheless, the greater part of the night was simply a rewind of the true West Coast rap game. With brilliant performers and a crowd that amplified the breathtaking performances, the ageless question was finally answered: The West had, indeed, won the game.

Come autumn, warm colors like brown and orange come to mind. Crisp, earthy leaves, golden apple cider and deep orange pumpkins are intertwined into perceptions of fall. October, however, is now branded by an additional color — pink. Breast Cancer Awareness Month, sporting a pink-ribbon mascot, annually takes place in October. But instead of advancing real change, many companies continue to exploit one of America’s deadliest diseases for their own gain.
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women (but can also be found in men). According to the New York Daily News, it occurs when cells grow abnormally and attack healthy breast tissue. The ultimate danger lies in metastasis, where cancer cells spread to other parts of the body.
Of the 220,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer each year, nearly 20 percent will likely lose their lives to the disease.
In the name of combating cancer, companies invest millions of dollars in breast cancer awareness. This disease makes its way to the human conscious through a plethora of corporate-funded activities. Make-up companies such as Avon and Revlon host walks throughout the year. Yoplait encourages its consumers to collect yogurt caps, which in turn are compiled as a donation marker. A spectrum of other companies — from rifle makers to car companies — participates in similar efforts.
Even though the U.S. population is led to believe they are supporting a worthy cause, how much is everyone really doing to fight breast cancer? Though Avon and Revlon support many communities affected by breast cancer, they act hypocritically by selling products containing the same carcinogens that research has linked to breast cancer. The Yoplait platform, according to Ecouterre.com, donates only a dime for each yogurt cap collected. It would be more efficient for consumers who want to donate to breast cancer research to write a check instead of eating exorbitant amounts of yogurt. Whatever call to action other companies proclaim comes with fine print as well.
These companies capitalize on a very painful disease. When October is decorated with pink everything, it trivializes breast cancer. The “Save the Ta-Tas” and “I Heart Boobies” campaigns obsess over the idea of breasts. When the correlation between saving lives and the means to do so is sexualized, it degrades those women fighting the disease.
With marketing product campaigns come spokespeople telling I’ve-been-cancer-free-thanks-to-this-company stories as the face of the campaigns. There is a social expectation for celebration in breast cancer, for women to put on a strong front, and yet, many ignore the terminally ill. Nowhere do we hear about the struggle and the treatment people undergo. Many feel repressed by a tyranny of happiness.
The final result is awareness, which provides nothing to society’s most hopeful goal — a cure. Yes, there are many positives of being cognizant of the disease, such as encouraging regular mammograms and creating a sense of unity among breast cancer survivors. The best way to battle breast cancer is through action, not inaction.
So next time you’re faced with an inundation of Breast Cancer Awareness products, think before you pink.

The basic problem is above and beyond the way Wang depicts it here. 
The entire breast cancer awareness movement is misguided. They never raise awareness about what the prime cause of breast cancer is: medical x-ray exposure. They never tell women that the real scientific facts on mammography show a whole different story than what they medical establishment keeps telling them (read Rolf Hefti’s e-book “The Mammogram Myth: The Independent Investigation Of Mammography The Medical Profession Doesn’t Want You To Know About”). 
But the do continue to raise awareness among the public that they need more money to “finding a cure” and to “fighting breast cancer.” It’s the perfect business for both the medical industry and the pink ribbon organizations: it generates a never-ending influx of money based on continually misleading the public with disinformation…
Awareness does save lives.  This article assumes that people know about breast cancer and/or get checked regularly.  I’ve heard many stories of how the awareness especially during October has inspired people to go get checked resulting in saving their life.  Yes a cure is the ultimate goal, but awareness is very important as well.  I disagree with this article entirely.  Why blame the companies?  At least they are donating.  Trust me, the people that buy yogurt are going to buy it whether the company donates or not.  They just want yogurt.
It is so tiring to read another article hating on corporations. 
I wonder if the author also hates on Angelina Jolie for publicly talking about her double mastectomy. After all Angelina did put a brave face forward – something that is apparently objectionable to the author. Also, I wonder if the author feels Jolie did this in part to gain publicity for her “brand” – she is a movie star after all.
Yes – corporations look for a business case in what they do. Why has making money become such a taboo? Wanting to make money in today’s social climate is what masturbation is to young teens – we all want to do it deep inside but we absolutely don’t admit it openly to others.
You have hit on my favorite subject!  Given the science behind dairy consumption and breast cancer proliferation, Yoplait should pull it product from the shelves in October.
Before this month even began, I was seeing all kinds of pink. As a result, I wrote this http://anewme515.blogspot.com/2013/09/breast-cancer-awareness-month.html, offering a possible alternative to handling this month – or even donations in general. I think a lot of people want to help. They just don’t really know how, or know the things they need to know about those organizations they give money to. I just had a thought. I think I am going to go write another blog entry. Thanks for what you wrote. Hopefully you will give people something to think about before sharing their money in a way that only helps the company or organization, and not the individuals affected by the disease.

You’ve been considering buying a new pair of headphones for a while, but aren’t quite sure where to start looking. You could visit an electronics store in person or maybe call up a friend and ask for their advice, but you settle for a simple Google search. Instead of the search merely revealing possible purchase options, however, you are startled to see your friends’ names and pictures alongside their own personal reviews of their favorite headphones. That’s right: Personalized ad endorsements are coming to Google.
Emily McPeek | Daily Trojan
The company updated its terms of use on Friday to allow these “shared endorsements,” stating that its Google+ users will soon be seeing their names, faces and comments in ads beginning Nov. 11. The reviews will be pulled from content they’ve shared on Google+ or other Google services such as YouTube. That means that anything you’ve ever written on a YouTube video could be exploited for Google’s advertising purposes.
The policy isn’t all that different from how Facebook utilizes its users’ “likes” to promote certain products and services. If you “like” a product or company on Facebook, the site will use that information to make you a sponsor for that product. An ad will soon begin to surface on your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds saying that you liked this product — so hey, why don’t your friends like it too?
The strategy behind this tactic revolves around the fact that recommendations from people you know resonate much more strongly with a potential buyer than random reviewers on the web. It might be helpful for people to see reviews from real people whom they actually trust — these personalized endorsements could facilitate a lot of decision-making about things such as where to go for dinner, which new car to buy or which headphones to purchase.
At least, that’s what Google thinks. “We want to give you — and your friends and connections — the most useful information. Recommendations from people you know really help,” Google said in its announcement.
Despite the usefulness that personalized endorsements could provide to Google users, the new policy is not only an invasion of privacy, but also a little tacky.
In regards to privacy, Google+ users probably never imagined that their reviews would one day be used to help Google profit and to help advertisers sell a product. Their words and online support for products were written when no such endorsement policy existed, and had Google+ users known their words could one day be much more visible in Google searches, they might have worded a review differently or simply not written one at all.
Furthermore, Google’s new plan is very clearly a way for the firm to use their 190 million Google+ users to help them make even more money in the advertising space. Their dedicated users will soon become company spokespeople, inadvertently working for Google to help advertisers make a sale. Again, it seems more than a little tasteless.
I have to admit, however, that Google handled their decision in a commendable way. The company announced the change a full month before it is set to take effect, giving users plenty of time to decide whether or not they are comfortable with sharing their reviews with others. Google has made it surprisingly easy to opt out of the policy: If you are a Google+ user, simply go to the settings page on your account called “Shared Endorsements.” From there, users can uncheck the box that gives Google explicit permission to use their content.
But even if unwilling users don’t have to partake in the sponsorship, the company’s new policy still raises questions and doubts about online data collection by companies such as Google. If a review you wrote five years ago on a YouTube video has the potential to surface in your friends’ Google searches, you have to wonder what other personal data is available, accessible and exploitable by other industry giants.

Another over-reactive DT headline…the article in no way specifies how Google’s new ads pose a risk to user privacy.
I am amazed at how poorly educated even college students are about using the internet. They will post embarrassing pics and vids of themselves on a space as public as the internet (regardless of platform- i.e. Twitter, YouTube, etc) and then become indignant when their “privacy” is compromised. This has all the intellect and integrity of a Kim Kardashian/ Kanye West tooling around LA in a bedazzled Escalade with gaudy chrome spinners – having their most intimate moments displayed in reality TV – and then they become indignant when the media “invades their privacy”…
BTW – no one is forcing you to “+” anything. My response to the funny adjoining cartoon in the article is – how self important does one have to be to shout to the world they love Doritos in the first place?

The Women of Troy notched their tenth straight victory Sunday afternoon, rolling past rival Oregon 3-0 (25-23, 25-18, 26-24) to improve to 16-1, one win shy of matching the 2006 squad for the best start to a season in school history (17-1).
“I thought we played outstanding volleyball today,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “The players executed the game plan extremely well and made me very proud of the hard work they’ve put in.”
USC improved to 48-9 all-time against the Ducks and, more importantly, avenged a tough 3-0 loss at the Galen Center last September. Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu recorded a team-high 11 kills to go along with three blocks. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who in Haley’s words “dominated” Friday against the Beavers, added nine kills, three blocks and another service ace. Senior libero Natalie Hagglund anchored the defense with another strong outing, posting 21 digs, tallying at least 20 digs for the fifth time this season.
Unlike the OSU match, USC was tested heavily from the beginning, as Oregon turned a 7-4 deficit into a 13-11 lead. The Women of Troy went on a 4-0 run and later pushed ahead 19-16 on senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard’s kill, but the Ducks came back to tie it at 20. USC then pulled away, as Nwanebu knocked down a kill to make it 24-22 before sealing the set 25-23 with a kill off of an Oregon block.
The second set remained contentious early on, as the two sides played to ties of 8 and 10. After back-and-forth play, USC took a 19-16 lead after Bricio and junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer notched back-to-back kills. The Ducks closed to within 23-17, but Nwanebu recorded another kill and Bricio slammed her 44th ace of the season to clinch the set at 25-18.
The Women of Troy appeared to be running away with the third set, as they held a 10-5 advantage after a kill by Schraer. USC then pushed ahead to 21-13 on a Bricio kill from the back and looked to be in control, but the Ducks impressively stormed back and recorded a stunning nine straight points to take a 22-21 lead. Oregon then went up 24-23, but USC avoided a fourth set with back-to-back blocks and an Oregon error that sealed their 10th straight win of the season.
“Oregon is such a top team, and they beat us 3-0 in our gym last year,” Hagglund said. “We had a lack of focus in the third set, but I think it was very important overall that we executed and finished the game in that situation.”
The victory served as the 1,200th career victory in Haley’s 35-year career. USC also improved to a stellar 85-7 in matches as the No. 1-ranked team and are 8-0 in the state of Oregon since 2008. The 10-game winning streak is the longest since USC opened the 2012 season with 13 consecutive victories.
USC will hit the road again this week for matches against Arizona State Friday and Arizona Sunday.

The USC women’s soccer team came away with two impressive results in the Bay Area this weekend, tying No. 8 California 1-1 on Friday and stunning No. 5 Stanford on Sunday with a 1-0 shutout victory. Junior midfielder Alex Quincey played the role of the hero for the Women of Troy in both matches, picking up an equalizing goal against the Bears and the winner against the Cardinal. Quincey’s excellent weekend helped her squad pick up its first Pac-12 win while ending a rough four-game losing streak. USC now stands at 6-6-2 overall, with a 1-3-1 Pac-12 record.
In Friday’s match, it was immediately apparent that USC’s recent skid was a distant memory. The team came out firing, putting steady pressure on a Golden Bears team that was riding a 13-game undefeated run. The Women of Troy outshot Cal 20-8, while overcoming 21 penalties en route to the much-needed draw. In the first half, freshmen forwards Kayla Mills and Tanya Samarzich led the USC offense to multiple scoring opportunities, but USC could never quite convert. It was the Bears, in fact, who struck first, opening up the scoring with a Rachel Mercik goal in the 27th minute. Just before the half, USC sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo nearly evened the score off of a promising corner kick from sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink, but her shot was turned away at the last second.
In the second half, the Women of Troy continued to dominate possession, but could not get the breakthrough they needed. It was not until the 78th minute, however, that USC finally got on the scoreboard. A wayward Cal clearance landed at the feet of Quincey, who ripped an impressive shot from distance into the inside of the net. The goal marked the end of 454 minutes of scoreless play for the Women of Troy, and seemed to lift a weight off the team’s shoulders. Though the team did have a few chances at winners in regulation and overtime, a tie against the undefeated Bears remained a welcomed result.
“[The goal] felt great,” Quincey told USCTrojans.com. “With the scoring drought we’ve had, I think it kind of gave us that boost. Hopefully from now on, we’ll just be scoring tons of goals.”
Two days later in Palo Alto, USC was just as prepared for its second top-10 matchup of the weekend. In a more controlled effort, the squad played to its strengths — possession and defense. USC junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley came up with eight saves against a Cardinal team that outshot the Women of Troy 15-8 and certainly had plenty of opportunities to score. Still, USC very much appeared like it belonged with the nation’s best throughout the game.
“It took major fight, major courage,” Mills told USCTrojans.com after the game. “[The defense] is awesome, and sometimes they don’t get enough credit because of our lack of scoring.”
Once again, however, it was Quincey who sealed the victory. At the 59-minute mark, the junior headed a beautiful Mills corner kick off the crossbar and into the net. The goal followed a scoreless first half and led into another stretch of solid defensive play to clinch the win.
It was clear that the goal and the win were a cause of relief for USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin and his players.
“We had been waiting 35-plus chances for a corner to go in,” the seventh year coach said. “It felt really good.”
The win ended a five-game winless drought for the Women of Troy and extended a three-game losing streak for the Cardinal (9-3-1, 2-3-0).
“We had been close so much this year, and it had been heartbreaking the types of losses we’d taken,” Khosroshahin said. “These ladies deserved this. I couldn’t be more proud of this team and it’s about time the ball bounced in our favor.”
