Carmen Alvaro | Daily Trojan
On Monday night, British pop princess Lily Allen reclaimed the spotlight with a stunning performance at the Fonda Theatre. Just three shows into her “No Shame” tour, she proved that four years away from the stage did not diminish her artistic capabilities.
 While opening act S-X failed to properly engage the audience, Allen was met with a more than enthusiastic crowd. She paired a sparkly green jumpsuit with neon green eyeliner, capturing the fans’  attention as she opened the night with “Come On Then.” 
On the track, Allen addresses her history with negative press coverage and its effect on her personal life. The upbeat pop anthem managed to showcase her vulnerability while also projecting her pain onto her critics, setting the mood for the night.
 Allen’s strong entrance couldn’t compare to the crowd’s obvious affection for “LDN,” off of her first album “Alright, Still.” The first two songs, both from her 2018 album “No Shame,” did not receive the same energetic response as her earlier hits. 
Allen then returned to tracks from “No Shame” with greater enthusiasm. Another surge of energy came from her empowering anthem “Knock ‘Em Out,” in which Allen focuses on women’s uncomfortable experiences when trying to get out of a conversation with men.
 Allen then sang both her oldest song and newest song back-to-back. She noted that “Smile” was written 14 years ago, while “Party Line” was written only three weeks ago. After audible complaints from fans to not make them feel old, the 33-year-old singer joked that her dance moves were a result of her not knowing what do with herself anymore due to her age. 
 Allen’s jokes were some of the most engaging parts of the night; her honesty and openness allowed for a deeper connection with the crowd. She joked about how the tight budget caused a song to sound differently than originally intended and how she had no choice but to end the show, even though everyone was anticipating an encore.
Although there was an enthusiastic response to the slower songs that followed, the crowd erupted when Allen asked them what time it was. After a few responses were shouted back, she used her question to lead into “Who’d Have Known.” While a simple transition, it pumped up the crowd for the final song of her main act, “Not Fair” an upbeat number about women’s dissatisfaction in the bedroom.
 The encore began with “Apples,” which felt awkward as a slower song after the night’s prominently upbeat tracks. Despite this, the crowd embraced “Trigger Bang,” a new song that nevertheless had the crowd singing along.
 Allen used her final song to make a political statement, calling attention to Brett Kavanaugh’s controversial confirmation to the Supreme Court. The song, “Fuck You,” was originally written as a goodbye to former president George W. Bush, but this time Allen dedicated it to Kavanaugh and President Donald Trump, which was met with loud cheers.
 Allen maintained a consistently lively stage presence for the entirety of the show. She appeared to  respond to the music rather than perform it, smiling and laughing throughout her set. The positivity pervaded the crowd, despite addressing complex subjects such as politics, negative press and unwanted advances against women. The audience responded to each song with a similar amiability, and it allowed them to both engage with the music and consider the greater implications of Allen’s lyrics.

Played by ear · Lewow and Van Liere’s artist and repertoire company, Bottom Feeder Management, was established in early 2018. The six-person team currently manages two artists and is looking to expand its reach. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
On a Saturday night in late September, hip-hop artist Michael Casper was set to play his first show in an inconspicuous house on 36th Street. His managers, sophomore music industry students Sean Lewow and John Van Liere, had carefully crafted the moments leading up to Casper’s performance, even changing the set list so that certain friends could catch Casper’s performance before leaving. But right as Casper was supposed to take the stage, he was nowhere to be seen. 
Lewow sprinted down 36th Street searching for Casper, who had gone to the grocery store, while Van Liere tried to stall the lineup and persuaded the audience to wait. At the time, the stress sent them both into a frenzy. But recalling the incident several weeks later, in between bouts of laughter, Lewow and Van Liere saw it as just another part of the job — running their own A&R company, Bottom Feeder Management.
“We were just yelling at each other all night,” Van Liere said. “At the end of the day he played a great set, and we all had a really fun time. We got mad at each other for a second and then five minutes later we’re back at it talking like normal. That’s how it goes.”
Lewow and Van Liere met at a parents’ mixer for music industry majors at the Thornton School of Music and immediately realized that they shared similar goals and visions. In high school, both Van Liere and Lewow put on shows for charity, and Van Liere also admired his partner’s work ethic, which he said set him apart from others in the music industry.
“Everyone always has lofty goals and aspirations, but a lot of people don’t actually do anything about [them],” Van Liere said. “We instantly gravitated toward each other because we were both really doing it.”
Lewow and Van Liere began bouncing business ideas off of each other until they settled on a promising one called the “Thornton Collective.” Initially, they aimed to leverage Thornton’s connections to help student musicians release their work in the real world, but soon found that many talented artists outside of campus who were also looking for representation. 
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
“And then we were like, why are we doing this through the school? We can just do it ourselves,” Van Liere said. 
Thus, Bottom Feeder Management was born. The company’s six-person team comprises Lewow, Van Liere, three videographers from Ouros, a creative collective and an audio engineer. Currently, managing two artists — Casper and Joe Avio — is a full-time job. The team worked on Casper’s debut single “Teenage Apathy” and his upcoming music videos, as well as Avio’s debut album release in November. 
“We want to create someone that has an aura, a name that people recognize, and can use that status as more of a cultural figure to do good,” Van Liere said. “We’re not creating music — we’re creating worlds.”
Understanding the artists as friends and individuals allows Lewow and Van Liere to tap into the artists’ most authentic, nuanced personas. Their focus on building relationships trumps the goal of creating a hit track, which is why they spent months getting to know Avio and Casper before agreeing to work with them.
“I’d say for us it’s very much a relationship game,” Lewow said. “At the end of the day, they’re our best friends.”
However, that focus on personal relationships can cause tension. 
“It gets tough, but only because people are … really passionate about waking up each morning and getting involved in this stuff,” Lewow said. 
Despite the stresses of the job, they’re able to work through difficult moments — like the incident at Casper’s first show — by prioritizing their friendship above all else.
“[We’re able to look past these instances] because at the end of the day it’s not important,” Van Liere said. “If [Casper is] five minutes late to his set, we’re freaking out in the moment, but then afterward … why would I let this stupid thing carry on?”
Lewow and Van Liere are in the same fraternity, live in the same house and share the same social circle. Despite this physical proximity, they say their ability to cooperate stems from their complementary personality traits. Van Liere handles internal logistics, working on production and creative direction, while Lewow handles external logistics, such as interfacing with professionals and in-house public relations.
Over the past semester, they’ve had to adapt to the changing music climate brought on by Spotify and other music streaming services, as well as learn to recognize and overcome their own personal flaws.
“We started with a blank piece of paper, and we’re drawing a roadmap for ourselves,” Van Liere said. 
As the company evolves, Van Liere and Lewow’s goal is to make Bottom Feeder live up to its name — harvesting talent at the figurative bottom of the barrel and looking for up-and-coming artists whose careers could benefit from professional representation.
“We want to get [Casper] out of … working 9 to 5 every day at a Chinese restaurant,” Lewow said. “He’s the most creative, just beautiful human you’ll ever meet. And Joe, he’s slaving away at school … but at the end of the day, he needs to be a professional musician.”
The phrase “at the end of the day” is one that Lewow and Van Liere use often. Perhaps the defining aspect of their company is their clear, unadulterated understanding of their motivations. 
“These artists have become my livelihood,” Lewow said. “At the end of the day, they are our very close friends and that gives us that added attachment to them … these people deserve to succeed, and it is our job to help them get there.”

On a Tuesday afternoon at Galen Center, Khalia Lanier tosses her jacket courtside after running a suicide. She is frustrated with her performance after losing a game during an in-practice scrimmage. She refocuses for the next one, and rattles off an emphatic hit. Everyone in the facility turns and takes notice after hearing the ball strike the court, untouched by the opposing players.
Lanier, USC’s high-profile junior outside hitter, hasn’t always asserted her presence on the volleyball court. The daughter of NBA Hall of Famer Bob Lanier, she recalls playing basketball early on, but found herself connecting more with volleyball. 
“I always tried to play basketball behind him and had this issue with feeling like I wasn’t in my own spotlight — being Bob Lanier’s daughter instead of Khalia Lanier,” she said. “I think just getting a different experience and kind of wanting to make a name for myself is what really drew me to the sport.”
The pressure of being the child of a professional athlete can be challenging, and Lanier recalls playing five sports at one point — trying to figure out what she enjoyed the most. She found volleyball to be a “cathartic experience” that allowed her to express her emotions and relieve that pressure through sport.
It turned out to be a successful choice.  She was named the Gatorade National Player of the Year her senior year in high school at Xavier College Preparatory in Phoenix. Last year, as a sophomore, she was recognized as an AVCA first-team All-American and a Volleyball Magazine first-team All-American.
But volleyball didn’t come naturally to Lanier. She faced a challenge in learning to play volleyball, and found she had to be patient and battle herself. 
“You have to learn how to have self-compassion while doing your job and doing the tasks that are asked of you, but not letting it become overwhelming and having the compassion and patience with yourself to understand that sometimes you will have bad days,” Lanier said.
Lanier’s journey in the sport — from learning to play to the college recruitment process — was always filled with pressure. Since her freshman year in high school, Lanier knew that her top choices for college teams included USC, Texas and Stanford. After visiting USC, her gut told her it was the perfect fit. 
“[What] I love about USC is the diversity and the feeling of being at a really great academic school along with a good college experience,” Lanier said. “I think [former head coach] Mick Haley did a really great job in recruiting and showing off the benefits of the school and making sure that I connected with the girls.”
Since arriving at USC, Lanier has made quick progress, accumulating stats as well as accolades with 1,214 kills and 717 digs through three seasons thus far.
Lanier’s growth as a player and a leader on the team has not gone unnoticed by her coach and teammates.
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
“[Lanier is] an elite athlete,” said Brent Crouch, the women’s volleyball head coach. “She’s actually a really cerebral player. She thinks about the game both from a technical level, how to move her body in space, and a tactical level — which shot should I be hitting? What decision should I be making?”
Her teammates see her as simultaneously intimidating and encouraging, excelling as an individual while pushing them to perform better overall.
“[Khalia’s] starting to vocally lead in games, which previously wasn’t something she focused on, but now it’s something that she’s bringing to the table during matches,” senior libero Victoria Garrick said. “I know it’s really helpful because as one of the best players, it really means a lot when she gets on us to work hard.”
Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro recalls feeling excitement as well as pressure to play her best around Lanier when she first joined the team.
“As a player she’s focused … [and] she gives me lots of confidence when we are playing,” Lázaro said.
Garrick said Lanier’s impact on the team has been bigger than just on the court. 
“As a teammate, Khalia’s got an infectious personality,” Garrick said. “Everyone who meets her loves her, and it’s just great to have someone on the team who is always bringing something new to the conversation and making us laugh, making us cry, just really making us feel all sorts of emotions.”
After the program underwent a coaching change this past offseason, Lanier had to get used to a new system, but she has responded by playing an impressive season in her junior year so far, with 203 kills and 118 digs in addition to her team-leading 18 service aces.
Crouch attributes Lanier’s growth in response to the offseason change to her dedication to the game.
“She didn’t get to practice a lot in the spring and summer because of some back issues, but she was always in practice, whether she was practicing or not,” Crouch said. “She [was] intent on learning the new things that we were teaching and she is she actually is able to change technique fairly quickly.”
Lanier said she has grown outside the lines of the court and more than just as an athlete. 
“Being in a college like USC …  you have the chance to be in this melting pot of Los Angeles,” Lanier said. “Getting the experience both inside of campus and outside and really like develop and have life experiences and [the] ups and downs all go towards your growth as a person.”
From here, Lanier — a human biology major — is keeping the Olympics in mind as considers what her career after volleyball will be.
“I’m definitely in this kind of transition period in my career where I’m trying to learn the balance between volleyball and life,” Lanier said.

Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman has recorded 209 yards on 11 receptions. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Following the bye week, USC held its first practice of the week as they prepare for No. 19 Colorado. The players and coaches felt this was one of their strongest practices yet. 
“Today was one of our better practices of the season,” offensive coordinator Tee Martin said. [I’m] really excited about the way they approached today.”
The bye week helped freshman quarterback JT Daniels recover from the brutality of college football, something his body isn’t used to. 
“I was tired and sore, ” Daniels said. “Now I’m not as tired and not as sore.”
Daniels has demonstrated poise in the past couple games, an improvement he hopes to carry against a tough Pac-12 South opponent this Saturday. 
The team made sure to make use of the bye week to smooth out the connection between the Daniels and his receivers, which junior wide receiver Michael Pittman said is improving. 
“I think the bye week was good to get us fresh, but it kind of did get us off beat,” Pittman said. “But I felt like today we got back.” 
The offense has worked on the small things, attempting to fine-tune the details. In spite of two early losses, the team still has the same goal it did at the start of the year — win the Pac-12. 
“[The Colorado game] is a chance to … get a win,” Pittman said. “Help us get to the next game, [and] next game until we get to the championship, [then] the playoff, until we get to the College Football Championship.” 
Last year, the team didn’t have a bye until the last week, which made scouting difficult. Martin felt the extra time helped him pour through and break down the film. 
“The secondary looks good with the two veterans that we played again a year ago,” Martin said. “The safeties are active up front. Overall, I think they’re a solid team [with a] solid defense. We’ll challenge our guys as much as we can to go out and identify the looks and communicate.”
Colorado leads the Pac-12 South standings at 5-0, but has not played a ranked opponent so far. Regardless, USC will have the challenge of containing sophomore wide receiver Laviska Shenault Jr., who already has over 700 yards and 10 touchdowns in five games. USC will have to defeat Colorado to keep its hopes of making a third consecutive Pac-12 Championship appearance.
“They are really a balanced offense,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Between the quarterback that can create and throw, a talented receiving core, and a running game. That’s one of the reasons they’re putting up 39 points a game.”
After collecting 18 penalties for 169 yards against Arizona in their last game, the Trojans are prioritizing a clean game this weekend. 
“When you’re playing a team that’s 5-0, you cannot waste a possession,” Helton said. “You have to be able to get them off the field. They’ve been very good at keeping drives alive, spreading the ball around. But you’ve got to get off the field on third down. You cannot give them the opportunity with a penalty to get a first down.”
The coaching staff is taking responsibility as they look ahead realistically at the rest of their schedule.
“We had important talks in the office about the missed opportunities we’ve had [throughout the season], for whatever reason, and how we’re going to fix it,” Martin said. 
Helton confirms Bolden’s departure
Helton confirmed that sophomore safety Bubba Bolden is no longer a member of the team. According to a post on his Instagram account, Bolden said he withdrew from the University following an incident at a party. His departure has been missed on the defense, as he was named the starter preseason but was suspended before the season began.
“I wish him nothing but the best,” Helton said. “[He’s a] good player, [and a] good kid. Hopefully it will be a very bright future for him. I know it will be.”
Injury report
Redshirt senior defensive lineman Malik Dorton is working through an ankle injury. Senior linebacker Porter Gustin has been holding back with an ankle injury, but participated in practice. Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele was involved in a car accident, and the team is taking precautionary measures before clearing him. The staff will reevaluate him later this week. Freshman safety Talanoa Hufanga is back from a quad injury. Sophomore linebacker Levi Jones is still dealing with illness. Freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is back from a shoulder injury.

Freshman quarterback JT Daniels has a completion percentage of 59.9 percent and a total of 1,257 yards. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
USC football didn’t play a game last weekend, as one could deduce from the lack of activity on 28th Street Saturday. 
Instead, the team held three practices during the bye week, as opposed to the usual four. Freshman quarterback JT Daniels was a partial participant on Tuesday and Wednesday, as he worked on “footwork and conditioning.”
“As a freshman quarterback, you don’t want him to hit that wall at the wrong time,” offensive coordinator Tee Martin explained.
In addition to resting Daniels’ arm, the bye week provided valuable rest for banged-up players like freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin. Heading into a clash with the undefeated Colorado, the Trojans will need all hands on deck. 
It appears as though it was a controversy-free week for USC — aside from the departure of safety Bubba Bolden. But the lack of practices is sure to ruffle some feathers. Head coach Clay Helton has already caught flak from one of his players for the lackadaisical nature of practice sessions. 
“We’ve got to practice better. Period,” senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware said to 247 Sports after the Texas game. “Practice this week to me, to be honest, was kind of lazy, kind of slow. I feel like if we practice harder, we’ll play harder.”
When was the last time a player complained about practices being too easy? Following those frankly embarrassing comments, Helton ramped up the intensity at practice. Yet after an Arizona game, in which the Trojans were penalized a whopping 18 times and fumbled on three occasions, this vigor appears to have faded. 
“We addressed it as a team,” Martin said about the penalties, according to USC Athletics. “We addressed it as a unit. We’re going to try to move on and not have those.”
For a team that ranks 113th out of 129 FBS teams in penalty yards (least to most), “addressing” the issue probably isn’t enough. Penalties and poor snaps have continually  impeded — nay, imploded — an already inexperienced USC offense.
I’m a huge proponent of player safety. We’ve seen the perils of overworking student-athletes make national headlines this summer, and maintaining health is vital in order to make it through the gauntlet of a college football schedule. 
But when it comes to cleaning up avoidable mistakes like penalties, there doesn’t appear to be much urgency from the USC coaching staff. Bye weeks are important for resting players. They’re also a chance to clean up pressing issues on the practice field. 
Hopefully during this week’s practices, USC “addresses” less and fixes more. Then maybe the Trojans can “try to move on and not have those” pesky penalty things. 
In addition to my column, this week, I’ll be taking a look at the AP Top 5 and identifying a sleeper on each team to keep an eye on during the second half of the season. In 2017, Alabama’s Tua Tagavailoa and Arizona’s Khalil Tate came out of nowhere to steal the spotlight. Here’s who’s bound to follow in their footsteps:
No. 1 Alabama (6-0): Freshman wide receiver Jaylen Waddle 
We know all about the Crimson Tide’s quarterbacks, but this team is loaded with explosiveness across the board. No Alabama skill position player is more electric than Waddle — he’s scored on a 94-yard touchdown pass and a 63-yard punt return. Expect him to keep making plays as the Tide graduate to real competition. 
No. 2 Georgia (6-0): Sophomore wide receiver Demetris Robertson 
This one could have gone in a lot of different directions, but I have to give the nod to the transfer receiver from Cal. He hasn’t seen many touches this year, but when given the opportunity, he’s displayed home run potential, like on a 72-yard touchdown run in Week 1. The Bulldogs are loaded with skill players. But with one injury, Robertson could become Jake Fromm’s go-to receiver. 
No. 3 Ohio State (6-0): Junior defensive tackle Dre’Mont Jones 
Star pass rusher Nick Bosa has been out with injury, but Jones has stepped up in his absence. He leads the Buckeyes with 4.5 sacks, a ridiculous number for an interior lineman. Entering this season, Jones had one career sack. Now, he’s shooting up draft boards like Bosa. 
No. 4 Clemson (6-0): Freshman quarterback Chase Brice 
Senior Kelly Bryant transferred two weeks ago, leaving Brice as the Tigers’ backup behind Trevor Lawrence. When Lawrence suffered from concussion-like symptoms against Syracuse, Brice admirably led a game-winning drive. Applying Murphy’s Law, the Tigers are sure to call upon him again at some point this season. 
No. 5 Notre Dame (6-0): Senior wide receiver Miles Boykin 
In the Fighting Irish’s first four games, Boykin caught nine passes for 167 yards. In the last two weeks alone, he’s notched 19 receptions for 261 yards — eclipsing his 2017 total. Notre Dame kicked into a new gear when it replaced quarterback Brandon Wimbush with Ian Book, but Boykin deserves equal credit for the team’s ascent in the rankings.
As a final note, last week, I predicted that Utah would upset Stanford. The problem? I wrote it down absolutely nowhere and no one will believe me. In order to make things right, I’ll be predicting my upset of the week at the end of every column. 
Upset of Week: No. 17 Oregon beats No. 7 Washington at home. 
Washington barely escaped with a win at 0-5 UCLA last week. Now they travel to Autzen Stadium, a notoriously tough environment to play in. Plus, the Ducks have a lot to prove after blowing a late-lead against Stanford two weeks ago. Expect the Pac-12’s playoff hopes to become even murkier after a wild game in Eugene, Ore.

At last Thursday’s “Say NO to Ben Shapiro” rally, speakers and attendees alike jeered at the mention of the Daily Trojan, dismayed by a relentless barrage of inaccurate, often tone-deaf coverage. The lead-up to Ben Shapiro’s appearance on campus had been rife with controversy, both from the event and the protest that materialized to oppose it.
The complaints ranged from underreported protest numbers to a nauseating display of the “angry black woman” stereotype against black student leaders. In another instance, the newspaper’s coverage went so far as to erase a student organizer, Stephanie Solis, from the Solidarity Rally she had organized and hosted one week before, on Sept. 27. Meanwhile, Young Americans for Freedom chairman Maxwell Brandon was given seemingly infinite opportunities to bat his eyelashes, insist that all he wanted was open dialogue and step into the role of a responsible conservative dad amid a sea of screaming leftist children. 
Whatever the intent of the DT’s writers, the impact has been unmistakable. Marginalized voices were demonized, the malice of bad actors was sanitized and everyone walked away feeling a little used. The entire affair reeked of false balance, the type of saccharine “objectivity” that tends to occur when journalists take people’s words at face value rather than examining their actions.
It does not take much digging to conclude that Shapiro is not who he says he is. He claims to value debate, but he seems incapable of conducting himself in one. His book, “How to Debate Leftists and Destroy Them,” is less of a treatise on the virtues of open discussion and more of a handbook on showboating and humiliation. In his one-on-one debate with transgender rights activist Zoey Tur, he misgendered her incessantly within the first few minutes, causing her to lose her temper and attack him. He has since shied away from such level playing fields, preferring to snipe at college students in his audience from the comfort of a podium. Far from “standing up to leftist bullies,” Shapiro himself is the bully. He’s made a career out of being the bully in news media, from Breitbart News and Truth Revolt to the Daily Wire and Fox News. 
So if Shapiro was not interested in a genuine exchange of ideas, then bringing him to campus was a moot point. There is seemingly no value in using USC’s good name to elevate a talking head who distorts the facts to mislead people and legitimize hatred — at least, so long as this story is told in a vacuum.
Ask yourself who stands to gain from this farce. It certainly isn’t us pesky leftists, who are taking time out of our busy leftist schedules, leftist classes and leftist work-study jobs to defend ourselves against hate speech for free. But listen, YAF is heavily funded by the Mercer clan, the DeVos family’s foundations and at least one Koch brother. And yes, I mean that Mercer clan, the one that gave Breitbart News a blank check to bring young people to the far right by any means necessary. That DeVos family, with its one member who is leading our Department of Education. And yes, it’s those Koch brothers, the ones who breathed life into the Tea Party and supplied the bulk of cash that propelled our political climate into hopeless gridlock even before it plunged straight over the edge of insanity. 
These are people with well-documented political agendas and even deeper pockets, whose darlings are in charge right now. Their intentions — and what they stand to gain from these campus controversies — must also be addressed. They give YAF millions of dollars every year for campus events just like this one, after all. That agenda must be scrutinized, particularly since it has used our students as its playthings, exploiting our trauma just to simply that they could. 
It’s a shame that the Daily Trojan didn’t write on any of this, because they missed an opportunity to help the public understand why we we’re so angry. When journalists acting in good faith perpetuate the myth that marginalized students are angry for no reason, they leave room for others to demonize and dismiss us. 
Meanwhile, the root causes of our anger — brutality, dispossession and abuses of power from the Engemann Student Health Center to Washington, D.C. — go ignored. This was never a story about free speech and controversial ideas; it was about the cruel indifference of people in power. And in decontextualizing our anger, the Daily Trojan wound up missing the point.

Last week, Bloomberg Businessweek published a bombshell investigation detailing how China used tiny microchips to infiltrate U.S. technology companies. The investigation, which was reported primarily through anonymous sources, shocked the tech world, and behemoth companies like Amazon and Apple issued statements vehemently denying the report’s details. Bloomberg, a respected business publication, firmly stood behind its reporting.
Since most of the report’s details stem from information by top-level government officials and knowledgeable company sources, it’s a long shot for the public to ever get at the truth of the story. What’s more important than the truth, in this instance, is the sheer technological possibility of state-supported hacking. The U.S. government must recognize this threat, and actively work to address it. 
The report alleges that China infiltrated American companies’ hardware to gain access to high-value corporate secrets and sensitive government networks. In addition to 30 technology companies, the infiltration affected a major U.S. bank and government contractors.
The Bloomberg story should bring the nation’s attention toward the United States’ technological vulnerability, not only in digital platforms and voting machines, but also as a manufacturer of electronic goods. Companies like Apple and Google have sought to outsource product manufacturing to China at a cheaper price, and they’re not alone. An NPR report described how the U.S. supply chain is inextricably tied to China, especially when it comes to technological manufacturing. 
China makes 75 percent of the world’s mobile phones and 90 percent of its private computers, the report said. In a digital age when cybersecurity is essentially intertwined with national security, the allegations the story raises are quite frightening. While the Bloomberg story reveals a concentrated effort to target major U.S. corporations, current U.S.-China relations and China’s demonstrated history of cyber-espionage campaigns suggest that the country is more than capable of directing its efforts toward government agencies and elections.
We need to look no further than the United States’ demonstrated failure in cybersecurity matters during the 2016 election. The Russian-led hacking efforts into U.S. elections is emblematic of America’s passive mindset and approach with emerging technology. In July, Microsoft revealed that it blocked hacking attempts against three congressional candidates, the first example of cyberinteference in the midterm elections, Politico reported. Other countries have succeeded in impacting our elections through cyberinterference once, and as the summer’s hacking attempts show, they are attempting to do it again.
Government and election security officials are constantly voicing concerns about voting security in the midterms, yet states are slow to utilize federal funds to invest in upgraded voting technology before November. While some states prefer taking money from their own budgets, it’s worth noting that 22 states have no plans to replace their machines before the midterms. 
The U.S. also has no centralized agency that specifically deals with cybersecurity threats. Voting security and other technological responsibilities have been stretched across the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and several other internal cyber units, according to TechCrunch. Our technological legislation and distribution of cyber knowledge are weak compared to nation-states like China and Russia. 
Top lawmakers in positions to make cybersecurity policy changes have struggled to demonstrate their technological literacy. At Senate hearings in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified about the company’s abuse of data. Some senators raised questionable concerns about Facebook as a platform. If Congress can’t understand how the world’s largest social media platform operates, the future and longevity of our country’s digital infrastructure may be at risk. 
In late September, President Donald Trump hinted at China’s meddling in the midterm elections — an alarming accusation, considering the ongoing trade war between the two countries. Several other top intelligence officials have also placed China on a list of countries with the capability to digitally direct operations against the United States. The nation is only a few weeks away from the midterm elections. It’s crucial for state and federal governments to recognize our country’s digital vulnerability and work to resolve them in coming years. If the past two years are any indication, countries have effectively mounted election meddling and cyberinterference campaigns toward the country. And this time, vigilance might not be enough.

Twirling their vibrant, floor-length skirts to mariachi choreography, Grupo Folklórico can be found behind Heritage Hall on Wednesdays and Thursdays to practice its routines.
Through flirtatious choreography that reflects different aspects of Mexican culture, students in the group learn about the culture of each Mexican region that inspired the routines. 
Evelyn Lopez, a senior majoring in applied and computational mathematics, led the effort to create the new folklórico group at USC last semester, after the group had been inactive for several years. 
“I just had this random thought that if I graduate from here and this group doesn’t start … I’d be really disappointed,” Lopez said. 
This time, she said she took initiative by inviting friends like Brianna Pasillas, a junior majoring in narrative studies, to be the group’s first members, finding a faculty adviser and filing necessary paperwork to create an organization. 
Lopez, the club’s president, said Grupo Folklórico now features 15 dancers who attend biweekly practices, learning various Mexican dances and cultures from states like Jalisco, where folklórico is most common, and Sinaloa, which is notable for its banda music. 
Later this month, Grupo Folklórico will showcase both of these routines in its first performance at the Cultural Art Expo. 
Pasillas, who serves as the vice president, said she had little dance experience when she joined the group. She added that learning the different dances has helped her connect with and take pride in her culture.
“I feel like as a second generation Mexican American, I always felt just a little bit off to the side with my Mexican heritage and the culture,” Pasillas said. “I feel like [Folklórico’s], kind of easier for me to identify with it and be proud of it because it’s a really beautiful dance, and I really like being a part of it.”
Belen Espinoza, a senior club member majoring global health, said she grew up talking about and watching Folklórico performances with her family, but she had few opportunities to learn the dances herself. 
Joining Grupo Folklórico has allowed her and other students to learn more about Mexican cultures through dance and find a community of Latinx students on campus to connect with.
“It’s hard to feel at home on campus sometimes,” Espinoza said. “To have that thing you can participate in and be like, ‘I’m going to hear the music. I’m going to hear the language. I’m going to see the dresses. I’m going to feel at home [and it] just feels great.”
When Lopez was planning Grupo Folklórico, she recruited Jennifer Macias, a staff attorney at the USC Immigration Clinic, to help teach dances and cultures to the group, because of her 11 years of on-and-off experience performing and teaching Folklórico. 
Growing up, Macias said she would watch Folklórico performances at festivals and loved the skirts and music so, as an undergraduate student, she joined UCLA’s Folklórico group. She hopes to pass on what she learned at UCLA to students interested in learning about Folklórico.
“I think it’s important to build a sense of community for students, especially those who identify [with] or who want to learn about folk dances from Mexico,” Macias said. 
After she graduates next year, Lopez wants Grupo Folklórico to continue growing and being a community for students to take pride in their cultural identity.
“I want it to become something that everyone looks forward to watching and looks forward to inviting their family over to come watch,” Lopez said. “[I] just finally [have] something to represent our culture with and just something to be really proud of.”

After Kevin Ellison died Thursday, his family decided to donate his brain to the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center for researchers to study the effects that CTE may have had on him. He had mental health problems that may have been caused by CTE. (Photo courtesy of USC Athletics)
Former USC football captain and defensive back Kevin Ellison, who won three Rose Bowl games while at USC from 2005 to 2008 and had a brief NFL career with the San Diego Chargers, died on Oct. 4 while walking the I-5 freeway in the San Fernando Valley. He was 31. 
His mother, Judy Reisner, confirmed his death and said that he died after being hit by a car. The Los Angeles County coroner’s office did not release a cause of death.
Ellison’s brain will be donated to Boston University’s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center to study  CTE, according to  Reisner.
Kevin had dealt with mental health issues in the past, which his mother said may have caused him to be walking on the freeway where he died. 
Reisner said her son’s mental health issues may have been caused by CTE. The degenerative disease, caused by repeated traumatic brain injury,  is common among NFL players, the CTE Center found. Some families of football players have filed wrongful death suits against the league because of CTE. 
According to the CTE Center, 110 of 111 NFL brains that they studied were found to have CTE. They also said the disease caused symptoms including memory loss, dementia and depression, even years after head injuries stop occurring. 
In 2012 Kevin was put in a mental health institution for several months after being arrested on federal arson charges when he caused an apartment fire in Spokane, Wash. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
“He got gradually worse, just because he wasn’t taking care of it,” said Chris Ellison, Kevin’s brother. “He had stopped taking his medication, and it was hard for him too.”
However, Kevin’s life was also marked by happier memories. Reisner said Kevin had a “loving and magnetic” character. 
“Kevin had a personality where he was so accepting and loving of all people,” Reisner said. “He had a smile and eyes that were just engaging and drew you in. He cared about everybody.”
Chris Ellison commented on Kevin’s passion for football.
“He wanted to be the best,” Chris Ellison said. “He really believed that … he would know what everybody was supposed to do on the defense, and what everybody was doing on the offense. That’s just how he was.” 
Kevin started playing for USC football in 2005, and eventually became a captain for the Trojans.
“He died with a Trojan sweatshirt on,” Chris Ellison said. “He was a Trojan for life. He loved [the] campus, he loved the University, he loved the people there.” 
Kevin’s mother said USC was always the school he wanted to attend.
“It was really not a choice of other schools … he wanted to go to ’SC, so he took extra classes and graduated early from Redondo [Union High School] so he could start in January,” Reisner said. “He enjoyed playing at ‘SC, he enjoyed being in that school and that environment.”
After attending USC, Kevin was drafted in the sixth round of the 2009 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. He was also briefly part of the Seattle Seahawks during their off season. 
Chris Ellison said Kevin had a tattoo that read “Be the Best,” a mantra that Kevin lived his life by. 
Chris Ellison is planning a memorial service for Kevin on Oct. 27. No location has been set yet.
Kevin is survived by his mother, Reisner, his two brothers, Chris and Keith Ellison, and his sister, Camille Ellison.

Carson Scott, a graduate student in the Gould School of Law, has been interested in helping immigrant communities since childhood. (Annalise Pasztor | Daily Trojan)
From a young age, Carson Scott knew she wanted to help immigrants. 
Over the summer, the Gould School of Law graduate student worked with the Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project, helping over 60 unaccompanied minors and their guardians fight deportation through Esperanza’s Legal Orientation Program for Custodians of Released Youth. 
“It’s basically a presentation on what the responsibilities of custodians for unaccompanied minors are,” Scott said. “We also provide them with information on what the legal defenses against deportation are for the minors, how to find an attorney and what court proceedings are going to look like.” 
Scott said most of the minors she worked with had come to the United States on their own, but by the end of the summer she began to see some children that had been separated from their families at the border.
“It is a very emotional experience,” Scott said. “I had worked with trauma survivors previously, but this was a whole new thing. I didn’t realize how unprepared I was, because it’s challenging.” 
Mercedes Nuñez Roldan, Scott’s supervisor at Esperanza, said Scott is efficient, passionate and a great advocate for the people she works with. 
Scott, who was raised by a Mexican mother and American father in Phoenix, said growing up in an area where Latinos were not always welcome allowed her to understand why many of those in the United States fear for their safety. 
Outside of her summer work, Scott also volunteers at the USC Citizenship Project and is president of the Public Interest Law Foundation, which provides free legal assistance to marginalized communities.
Eliane Fersan, the director of USC’s Initiative on Immigrants and Global Migration, works closely with Scott through PILF. After hearing about her work from Esperanza and other immigrant rights groups, Fersan was drawn to Scott’s humility. 
“What struck me is her commitment to immigration issues, and not in a pompous way,” Fersan said. “She’s right there to get the job done.”
Working with children is not new to Scott. From 2009 to 2014, she ran a summer art camp with her brother in a small pueblo in Jalisco, Mexico. Scott’s grandmother, an artist, always complained about the lack of art education for students in her town, so the summer before her junior year of high school, Scott and her family started a makeshift camp for children to learn music, dance and visual arts at her grandmother’s house.
“[My grandma] would tell a few people in the town, and then the word would spread and then the day that the camp started, kids would just flood into her house,” Scott said. 
Since then, Scott’s interest in underprivileged communities and immigration has only grown. She is now at USC working with the school’s immigration clinic where she is representing eight different clients, as well as volunteering with Esperanza at least once a week. 
“Even though it’s really difficult work, I find it really rewarding,” Scott said. “I like interacting with the kids. It’s something I enjoy and it helps give me perspective of why I’m studying so hard and why I’m working so hard in school.”
This story is part of a mini-series highlighting Latinos at USC. It will run every week during Hispanic Heritage Month, which ends Oct. 15.
