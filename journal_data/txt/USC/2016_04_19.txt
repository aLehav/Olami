French Ambassador to the United States Gérard Araud visited USC on Tuesday at Doheny Memorial Library, where he spoke about diplomacy in the 21st century and the state of French foreign policy in an unstable world.
The event, which was hosted by the Francophone Resource and Research Center, was open to the public and included a Q & A portion.
Araud has served as the ambassador to the United States since fall 2014. His experience as a diplomat extends as far back as 15 years, as he has held multiple positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development, including Director of Strategic Affairs, Security, and Disarmament from 2000 to 2003, Ambassador of France to Israel from 2003 to 2006, Director General for Political Affairs and Security from 2006 to 2009 and Permanent Representative of France to the United Nations in New York from 2009 to 2014.
Araud specializes in the Middle East and strategic and security issues. He is also known for his modern approach to diplomacy.
In addition to his international reach, Araud is also well known for his digital presence, having told The New York Times in 2015 that “being outspoken on Twitter is part of being an effective ambassador in 2015.”
Araud began his speech by explaining what it means to be a diplomat in today’s international climate.
“There is a basic misunderstanding between the diplomats and men in the streets. They perceive that we’re not just pompous but also cynical,” Araud said. “The problem I think, when you’re trying to understand an international conflict, the first thing you have to conclude, and it’s not cynicism, is that the fact of who is right and who is wrong is irrelevant. It’s not this way that we do it.”
Araud explained how this sentiment stems from misconceptions about how diplomats think about conflicts.
According to Araud, diplomacy is less about drawing conclusions about a situation and more about understanding multiple perspectives and the historical events that back them up.
Araud used Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine as an example of how approaching foreign policy with a right versus wrong mentality can actually limit meaningful solutions to conflicts.
“You can say Russians are bad, period. But after that there are decisions, and what are you going to do?” Araud said. “You’re not going to die for Ukraine, you’re not going to send GIs to Ukraine. It shows that simply saying who’s right or wrong is leading you either down a dead end or to lead you to be the gendarme of the world, which you don’t want to be.”
Instead, Araud suggested that progress starts by understanding the perspectives of both sides.
He further said that understanding history is a valuable necessity not only for diplomats but also for everyday citizens of the world, and said that he thought most Americans could improve in this area.
“Like any country in the world, you have positive and negative history,” Araud said. “But you have to be aware of it, which means that when you arrive as a French in Nigeria for instance, we have an overwhelming historical burden, but we have to be aware of it because when you’re going to speak to these people, of course as a French in Nigeria or as an American in Nicaragua, you may say ‘Forget the past,’ but of course they won’t forget the past.”

The Los Angeles Police Department began an investigation into the death of an unidentified 22-year-old male near USC Tuesday afternoon.
After an initial response by the Department of Public Safety, LAPD began its investigation at 2:25 p.m.
The incident occurred at the 600 block of West 30th Street, according to LAPD media relations Officer Tony Im.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said that LAPD and the L.A. County coroner have taken control of the investigation.
“Initially, we were told it appeared to be an accidental overdose,” Carlisle said. “But that will be determined ultimately by the LAPD and the coroner.”
LAPD will notify the deceased’s family and determine when to make his name public.
UPDATE:
The man was identified as Jonathan Bisignano, a senior majoring in international relations (global economy) in a statement from Dani Byrd, interim dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, to students, faculty and staff in the School of International Relations on Friday.
The L.A. County Coroner said Bisignano was 22, not 23 as previously reported.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Gerard Bisignano said that his son had a hereditary heart condition and died in his sleep from heart failure. Gerard Bisignano said that he spoke with the coroner’s investigator and that no drug paraphernalia was found at the scene.
“Jonathan was known as a caring, smart and ambitious man,” Gerard Bisignano said.

Diversity and inclusion in media organizations was the topic of discussion at a panel held in Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday. The panel featured Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer for NBCUniversal Craig Robinson and Director of the Annenberg School of Journalism Willow Bay.
Robinson, who is in charge of defining and maintaining a corporate culture throughout NBCUniversal, explained ways to instill the values of inclusion and discussed the lack of diversity in the current media industry.
He made note of the difficulties that underrepresented groups endure in the media industry along with the high standards that are held for them. Robinson acknowledged that studies on diversity representation show problems within media companies.
“I feel embarrassed for us as an industry, but I am thankful more than anything else, because this information gives us something tangible to point to,” Robinson said.
He also acknowledged the fact that it is much easier to make a change when the problem is noticeable because it makes the problem one that is impossible to brush off.
After noting the issues that are prevalent, Robinson explained how he works toward eliminating the problem of inclusivity.
In 2013, Comcast purchased NBCU, and with this purchase came the question of company culture. Robinson explained that it is often difficult to get large companies to listen.
“The larger the company becomes, the less concerned it becomes about diversity and inclusion because it becomes less of a priority,” Robinson said.
With the acquisition of NBCU by Comcast, there was a higher percentage of people of color and a higher percentage women at each level of the company, showing that value of diversity and inclusion was not forsaken.
Instead, Robinson said, the company embraced the value of diversity and inclusion and used it better the environment of the company through the implementation of programs that aim to keep the discussion of diversity an ongoing one.
“Infrastructure really does matter because it puts things into people’s muscle memory,” Robinson said.
For this reason, diversity pipeline programs have been created in order to make the discussion of diversity a continuous one. These programs help recruit younger people for union and county jobs at NBCU.
“It’s a level of exposure that drives the pool,” Robinson said.
Robinson explains that NBCU will continue to recruit employees from different backgrounds starting from a young age and create awareness about the diversity of opportunities at NBCU.
This program has proven to be effective in getting people of all backgrounds involved and prevalent in the media industry; in fact, Aziz Ansari, an Indian-American actor and comedian, rose to fame from a NBCU pipeline program.
The Late Night program is an example of a diversity pipeline program that aims to develop emerging talent behind the camera. He explained that this is a fairly exclusive group because people tend to gravitate towards who they like and people who are similar to themselves.
“Late night writers are a real ‘fraternity,’” Robinson said.
In order to deter this exclusivity, the Late Night program focuses on exposing talented joke, sketch and comedy writers to NBCU’s late night and readying them for a staff position.
In the end, Robinson made it clear that lack of diversity is a problem that needs to be addressed today’s society, and it will be most effectively done if the discussion on diversity and inclusion is continued and acknowledge.
“Our focus here today is in media, but this is a societal problem,” Robinson said.

Undergraduate Student Government Treasurer Christian Edwards presented the full 2016-2017 budget, which allocates more than $2 million toward USG, to the USG Senate at its meeting on Tuesday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The budget will be approved next week.
USG funding comes from the $64 paid by each student both semesters every year. Though undergraduates contribute to the majority of the USG budget, $60,348 will also come from the previous year’s contingency fund.
The largest allocation will go toward Concerts Committee, with $470,293 allocated for the next academic year, a 57.8 percent increase since the 2014-2015 academic year. The annual Conquest festival has an additional $19,000 allocation separate from the Concerts Committee funding. The second largest amount will be designated to the Discretionary Fund, a board which funds programming for recognized student organizations.
Sen. Sabrina Enriquez asked about the allocation for Recreational Club Council. Enriquez was concerned as to why this was a USG funding issue, instead of one provided by Student Services.
“We no longer fund it. Graduate Student Government chose not to fund it last year, and that turned out just fine,” Enriquez said. “My question is, ‘Why are we funding RCC, when that’s probably something that should be funded by the University?’”
USG President Edwin Saucedo clarified the purpose of the RCC fee being included in the USG budget. Saucedo explained that several of the fund allocations which did not appear to belong under the USG budget were placed there because of their student-related programming nature.
“This is the Student Programming Fee, which comes from the University,” Saucedo said. “They give it to us, so if you see these items, specifically such as Conquest, Leadership Team, Volunteer Services and RCC, those are because they are directly dealing with students programming.”
Some of the newly-appointed Senators had questions concerning the nature of restricted funds and their separation from the rest of the allocations in the budget. Sen. Tyler Matheson asked about the nature of the reserve funds, which was not clearly explained.
Senator and Speaker Pro Tempore Paul Samaha explained the fixed nature of restricted funds, such as stipends and salaries for USG members. According to Samaha, these funds cannot be changed by the finance director or other USG members without an amendment and vote.
“Stipends and salaries are both in the bylaws; we can’t change those without changing the bylaws,” Samaha said.
Sen. Daniel Newman asked about the Senate Reserve fund. Saucedo explained the basis for the fund, which will essentially be used as a last-minute fund for USG members and committees who hold USG accounts, as has been done in past years. Saucedo also highlighted the amount of money that was over-allocated in previous budgets, which has collected as large amounts of “rollover” funds.
“One of the biggest issues we have with the University right now is that we have a ton of money rolling over,” Saucedo said. “They see us as Undergraduate and Graduate Student Government together, and they have over a million dollars rolling over on a yearly basis.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Christian Edwards was the Finance Director for the Undergraduate Student Government. He is the Treasurer. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

In an effort to increase environmental awareness on campus and promote behavioral change within the community, students in the class “Spatial Sciences Practicum” led a Green Room Certification Sustainability Audit on Tuesday at the Spatial Sciences Collaborative Classroom in the Allan Hancock Foundation Building.
The class’ professor Darren Ruddell said that the event, which was held in honor of Earth Day, was organized and spearheaded by the students in the class.
“It’s all student-generated,” Ruddell said. “I’m just more of a facilitator.”
The aim of the audit was to obtain more information about sustainability practices throughout the campus, according to Monty Hasan, a junior majoring in geodesign.
“We’d like to learn which departments on campus are doing a better job of being sustainable, [as well as] which departments need better awareness of their current practices,” Hasan said.
He added that with this data, the community can work towards finding alternative, more sustainable practices in order to create less of an impact on campus energy and water use, among others.
“The plan is [to] compare the department’s first, and then from there, in the future, give them some recommendations about how they can improve their practices,” Hasan said.
After a few minutes of discussion, the students split up and began their investigations of different buildings on campus, such as the campus bookstore, EVK, Ground Zero and Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall.
According to Griffin Kantz, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development, the sustainability of some buildings, specifically Ground Zero Performance Café, was remarkably high.
“I didn’t expect anyone to get 100 percent or close to 100, since these categories are very high-end green strategies like [having] all CFL lightbulbs, or the water refilling stations instead of water fountains,” Kantz said. “I was surprised that some of us got pretty high, [nearly] 80 percent.”
At the same time, however, Kantz said he was also surprised by the inefficiency of some buildings that were expected to be more sustainable.
“One of the surprising things was this particular building, Ralph and Goldie Lewis Hall, actually underwent a project called the Smart Group Project in the early 2000s, where the whole electrical grid and their building occupant use patterns were observed to really minimize energy consumption and the water waste,” Kantz said. “But it only got around 60 percent on the survey.”
In the case of buildings like these, Kantz said there may be technology that has been developed over the past 10 years that may be more efficient. At the same time, he added that the problem may instead lie with the categories and standards themselves.
“This project was actually award winning,” Kantz said. “The chief architect on it actually got an award for top 15 projects in an architecture magazine, so I was really surprised that it got only 60 percent.”
With the information gained from this audit, Ruddell hopes his students will learn to apply and identify sustainable practices not only on campus, but also in their personal lives.
“I hope they can learn some new things about being sustainable, not just where they go to school and spend their waking hours, but also [bring] it home, practice it at home, share it with roommates and family [and promote] more sustainable practices,” Ruddell said.
For Hasan, it is important that the community will begin to understand exactly what goes into becoming more sustainable through the results of the audit.
“You need to constantly reach out and involve the whole community,” Hasan said. “It’s not just a one-person thing, it’s a group effort. It’s really about spreading education and awareness.”

Water polo is a sport I had never watched until last August. Lacrosse is something I had never seen in person until March. These two teams are currently dominating the nation. USC’s women’s water polo and women’s lacrosse team are a combined 35-0 this year.
Despite their success, these sports are flying under the radar. Their success comes during a school year in which the football team had another tumultuous year that ended with mixed emotions — the hiring of head coach Clay Helton to go along with a great victory over UCLA that won the Pac-12 South for the Trojans before falling in the championship game to an underrated Stanford team and a season-ending loss in the Holiday Bowl.
USC basketball was relevant for the first time in ages, winning 21 games, beating UCLA three times and earning a spot to the NCAA tournament where they lost in the first round.
Those will be the storylines from this year that will be remembered even though there are other athletes who are equally deserving of attention and praise, if not more so given their record of success.
Fans should be watching these teams compete. I am one of the fans to blame as well. As previously mentioned, I hadn’t watched either sport until this year, but I can assure you, even someone who knows nothing of either sport will be entertained.
The competitive spirit and drive to greatness of these athletes is something to behold, and to have two programs dominating the competition at the same time is incredible.
Women’s water polo is No. 1 in the country and has been for several weeks. Women’s lacrosse has been steadily climbing up the rankings and has now broken into the top five.
The sports should be celebrated regardless of the outcome of the rest of their season as we celebrated a football and basketball team who had less dominating regular seasons and subpar postseasons. The lacrosse and water polo teams have the opportunity to do something special and cap potentially undefeated seasons with conference and national titles.
Should the water polo team put themselves in a position to end an undefeated season with a national championship, it would be the fourth for the team under the guidance of head coach Jovan Vavic who has also led the men’s team to nine national titles. Entering this season, the water polo team has played in the NCAA tournament 12 straight seasons and finished in third for the second straight year. Prior to that in 2013, the Women of Troy won it all.
The success of this program is well documented and should not come as a surprise to anyone, but this season has the potential to be one for the record books should the team finish their regular season on Friday without losing a game all year. The team is currently 20-0 and a win against Cal on Friday would put them at 21 wins — the same number as the men’s basketball team put up. The NCAA tournament is approaching soon after in May.
For the lacrosse team — a program in just its fourth year since its inception — the road to success is much shorter. After making their first NCAA tournament appearance last year and losing to perennial powerhouse Duke, the Women of Troy came back with a vengeance this season that has included avenging their previous loss to the Blue Devils.
As the Women of Troy have blazed through MPSF play, consistently putting up double-digit scores, critics could have said that the competition was below them and they should have been beating these teams. The Trojans 14th and 15th wins of the year came recently against the No. 12 and No. 6 team in the country.
The lacrosse team has similarly not dropped a game this season and is poised to have a legitimate shot at taking home a national title.
The harsh reality of the situation is however, if these teams fail to win it all, their masterful seasons will most likely be forgotten. Even if they do win the national title, there won’t be nearly the celebration that would have occurred had the football or basketball team gotten just as close.
Part of the reason is the school calendar in saying that the tournaments for lacrosse and water polo are just not as convenient for students to keep up with as March Madness or the College Football Playoff, and while that is certainly true to an extent, the fact of the matter is that the sports are just not as popular.
While they deserve credit and accolades to be poured upon them, there isn’t the same buzz surrounding these programs as there should be. It remains to be seen what the final storyline will be for these programs, but surely a dedicated slice of students will be paying attention regardless of what happens.
As Trojans, aren’t we all in the pursuit of perfection? We should be celebrating the athletes that have come the closest to achieving it.

For senior Will Robinson, his greatest memory over four years of running track at USC is coming in third place.
He was the anchor in the 4×400 relay race in the opening meet of his senior season. He had one goal — no one would pass him. The second the baton slapped into his hand, Robinson pushed, determined to keep up with the two runners ahead of him.
He ran out of gas at the 300-meter mark, legs pumping, lungs burning. That’s when he began to hear again.
Before then, Robinson ran in silence. A combination of adrenaline and focus blocked out every scream, every shout from the crowd. But as he lost steam, the noise of his teammates began to wash over Robinson in waves.
Above it all, he heard the voice of volunteer coach and two-time Olympic gold medalist DeeDee Trotter hollering his name, urging him to finish as strong as he started. His teammates chanted, begging him to hold his spot. So he did.
They took third. Robinson took the baton with his team in third, and he kept them there for 400 meters. After the meet, the coaching staff praised Robinson in front of the rest of the team. He kept his head down, his smile small. He didn’t run for the praise. He was just doing what he always does — being the best teammate possible.
Robinson isn’t the fastest runner on the team. Far from it. His best marks in the 800-meter race are significantly slower than some of his teammates. He’s never won a race, and he won’t make the Nationals roster.
But who ever said speed is all that matters?
For Robinson — soon-to-be Marine, devoted Christian, walk-on track athlete — there’s a whole lot more to running track than putting one foot in front of another. Track is about dedication to himself and his team. It’s about the communication and support passed on from one runner to another. Most importantly, it’s about the bonds he creates and the inspiration he cultivates every day. That focus on impactful relationships is what drives Robinson on and off the track.
On a good day, he’s busy. On a bad day, busy doesn’t even begin to describe it.
Sitting on the bleachers overlooking Cromwell Field, Robinson counts on his fingers all that he has to do today. He’s already had a science lab, a meeting for ROTC, an interview for a paper. The watch snugly fit on his left wrist blinks — it’s slightly past 10 a.m. In less than an hour, he’ll leave for bible study, then more classes, more interviews.
It’s a long day, he says. He promises they’re not all like this.
Robinson is used to getting the same question, on repeat — how does he do it all? His answer, true to character, is humble and boils down to a simple combination of hard work, eliminating distractions and always being kind.
In reality, this means setting 5:30 a.m. alarms to make it to NROTC meetings and hunching over lab reports late at night. But Robinson will adamantly say that he doesn’t do that much more than others, that his own story isn’t unique. He’s figured out the best schedule and lifestyle for himself.
It’s simple, he says. It’s just not easy.
Welcome to the life of a young man who splits his time between three passions and centers them all around his core values — a faith in God, friendships and giving his all every day. In his final year of college, Robinson has his life figured out. In a few months, he’ll graduate with a degree in human biology and move to Quantico, Virginia, to finish his training as a Marine. But the last four years have been a journey of finding himself, his faith and his place at USC.
In the first semester of his freshman year, Robinson was in a rut. He was struggling with school, but mostly Robinson felt that he hadn’t found his rhythm. He was an athlete in high school, running cross country and track and he was used to a comfortable routine. Halfway through his first year at USC, Robinson simply hadn’t found that.
So he walked into the track office and asked for a chance to walk on. The answer wasn’t definite, but Robinson kept coming back and asking again and again.
They never said yes. But they also never said no. And when the first meet of the season rolled around, Robinson’s name was on the list.
That was the beginning of his four-year love affair with the track team. Realistically, he shouldn’t have made the roster, shouldn’t have been kept on it when the coaching staff rolled over the next year. But he was. Since then, Robinson has dedicated himself to fulfilling his specific, unique role on the team — competitor, supporter, motivator.
Ask Robinson about track, and he’ll tell you about his team. He prides himself on knowing his teammates by name, knowing their schedules, their majors and their interests. He knows who is having a good week and who’s struggling or nursing a bum ankle.
Later in the week, he’ll lead them in a Bible study at Heritage Hall as part of Athletes in Action. He’ll cherish seeing a different side of his teammates, focused on prayer and reflection. Each Wednesday, he’ll lead the same group, hoping to strengthen a part of each athlete that has nothing to do with lifting weights or running sprints.
“I’m not perfect in any way, but I want to be someone who helps others first,” Robinson said. “And I feel like, if I can help someone in their walk in faith, that’s the greatest I can really do for another person.”
That love for supporting others stems from a single source — Robinson’s younger brother, Daniel.
At the age of 2, Daniel was diagnosed as autistic. He’s mild on the spectrum, Robinson says, but the experience made him grow up just a little faster. From a young age, Robinson understood that if Daniel needed help, it was his responsibility to give him a hand. Sometimes that meant helping tie his shoelaces or button his shirt. Other times, it meant coaching Daniel in social situations, letting him know how to behave or what to say when the words didn’t come easily for his little brother.
It meant being the odd one out. It meant being too mature, too understanding for his age. He was weird, Robinson said, in the way that he worked a little harder and cared a little more about others, even in elementary school.
He and his brother never fought. He couldn’t stand that. He couldn’t stand to see his brother belittled. He couldn’t stand to see other kids left out or treated poorly. And the fact that he couldn’t stand any of those things — isolation, bullying — led Robinson to begin a life dedicated to something more.
“That’s my brother and I love him,” Robinson said. “I think I realized from a young age that I wanted to help people in a very tangible way, because I always wanted to look out for him. He taught me how to care for others.”
Ask Robinson what he’ll remember about USC, and he’ll tell you that it’s the feeling of community, of having a family consisting of Christians and runners and Marines and Trojans, a massive, sprawling family that made him feel like he wanted his four years to last forever.
Ask him to give you one favorite memory, and he’ll tell you about an unremarkable moment on an unremarkable day when he was reminded why he’s on this team to begin with. It’s the day he helped Andre De Grasse to the trainer’s room.
This was years before De Grasse’s career sling-shotted him into the spotlight. Robinson had no idea that the runner close to collapsing on the track at his feet would one day become one of the brightest stars for the Canadian Olympic team. He simply reached out a hand, dragged the sprinter to his feet and half-carried him down to the trainer.
Two years later, when De Grasse was preparing to leave USC, he thanked Robinson for helping him.
“I’ll never forget that,” De Grasse told him.
It was funny to Robinson, because until that moment he had almost forgotten about it. To him, that was just another part of being a teammate. But the way De Grasse thanked him, the way that he remembered that kindness after two years of national attention and record-breaking marks — that stuck with Robinson.
De Grasse was a future Olympic champion, but Robinson was the teammate who picked him up before he was anybody. And that meant something. It’s the type of impact that Robinson hopes to keep making on his team, and on anyone who finds their way into his life.
“These are athletes who are known for their split times and their marks,” Robinson said. “I know them as more than that. I know them as people, and that’s really special. If I can touch their lives, if I can touch anyone’s lives, help them through anything, big or small, then I consider that a job well done.”
In a little over a month, Robinson will move multiple time zones away to begin his final Marine training at Quantico. It’s bittersweet, he says. On one hand, he’ll be realizing a dream years in the making. On the other hand, he’ll leave behind everything that has defined his life up until now. He’s not sure which is more powerful.
In a little over a month, everything will change. But for now, Robinson is enjoying the little moments, the last moments. He’s appreciating all that this school, his team and his community have meant to him, how much they have shaped him.
There’s so little time left, he says, and yet so much more to do — qualifying races, the national championships. He wants to cherish these final moments, because they have been the greatest of his life and they have molded him into the man, the runner, the soldier, the friend that he is today.
When this all ends in a few weeks, he will carry those memories, those lessons with him across the country. But for now, he’s not worrying about leaving. He’s just taking it one race at a time.

Artist Robert Mapplethorpe was known for his self-portraits and floral still lifes. In addition, the controversial and homoerotic nature of his later work sparked the attention of art critics nationwide. And though his work may be deemed too risque for the faint of heart, it would be foolish to discount Mapplethorpe’s impact on 20th-century art.
Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Medium is one of the latest special exhibitions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Currently on display in the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at LACMA (not to be confused with The Broad in downtown L.A.), the exhibit runs until July 31.
As stated on the exhibit’s website, “Mapplethorpe’s practice as an artist was characterized by inherent dualities. He sought what he called ‘perfection in form’ in everything from acts of sexual fetishism to the elegant contours of flower petals.” Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Medium features 182 of Mapplethorpe’s works, which includes pieces from from almost every point in his career. Of his earlier works, his “Untitled (Self Portrait)” from 1972 was particularly charming; it was minimal in style yet provoked the eye with its vivid colors.
Throughout his career, Mapplethorpe collaborated with well-known artists, such as Andy Warhol and Patti Smith. His famous friendship with Smith was showcased in the exhibit, featuring some of the many portraits he photographed of her, including the cover art for her studio album Horses. Further celebrity portraits displayed in the exhibit include bodybuilder Lisa Lyon, and singers Debbie Harry and Iggy Pop.
Mapplethorpe is not only celebrated for his artwork, but also serves as an icon for the male gay community. Much of his work from the late-’70s and into the ’80s emphasize the underground BDSM culture that gained popularity during this time. Though his work gained further exposure for its notoriously graphic content, it has also been criticized for its exploitation of the black male body. And though these portraits were difficult to analyze without scrutinizing the political undertones throughout, Mapplethorpe proves that his work can still garner controversy today.
Conversely, the sensitive nature of his floral works are graceful in essence. Particularly, his “Parrot Tulips” seemed to be a favorite of most patrons visiting the gallery, with its rich colors reminiscent of his earlier works. The dichotomy in Mapplethorpe’s work not only showcases the versatility of his work, but also invokes admiration for the tragic artist.
Tickets for Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Medium are $25 for general admission and free for LACMA members. More information regarding the exhibit may be found online.
I have a suggestion, his works might be appropriate in those new grey all gender bathrooms being installed on campus.

This week marks USC’s third annual Arts Week, a series of events where students can come together and embrace the innovative arts around them. Arts Week is will showcase the best of student and professional talent everyday this week. Each day will feature a different event, asking the quintessential question, “how do you ARTiculate?” Along with this, check out other installations such as collaborative murals at the Popup Art Garden: ARTiculate Creativity in Alumni Park.
“Arts Week was created to celebrate the diverse types of arts on campus and how art is used to articulate feelings, thoughts and emotions,” said Carrie Zhang, assistant director of USC Performing Arts Committee. “The central theme is to ‘ARTiculate.’”
So far, the festival has brought great success. Monday kicked off Arts Week with free food, music, art installations and live art in Alumni Park. Tuesday brought the Artist Network Mixer, where USC alumni and students were able to network while watching the best USC artists perform. If anyone was unable to make these creative events, there’s still three more left to look forward to.
On Wednesday at noon, the Performing Arts Committee, Environmental Student Assembly and Concerts Committee will collaborate with with the USC Farmers Market for a solar-powered “It’s Lit Noontime Show” in McCarthy Quad. Indie band Trapdoor Social will perform live music with audio equipment powered by on-site batteries that get their energy from solar panels.
Thursday’s signature event will display killer dance moves with the dance competition USC’s Best Dance Crew: ARTiculate Movement at 7 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. In addition, there will be a special finale performance and VIP Meet and Greet by Quest Crew, winners of the TV show America’s Best Dance Crew.
Friday’s last event will be in collaboration with Performing Arts Committee, the USC Poetry Slam Team and USC Speakers Committee. “Slam Poetry: ARTiculate Words” will showcase poems at Ground Zero Performance Café starting from 8 p.m. to 9:30 pm. Listen to USC poets show off their spoken word pieces while enjoying a free milkshake. A special guest poet will also make an appearance.
More information regarding Arts Week can be found online.

There’s this college trope of hooking up with someone, then never wanting to see them again. Maybe you were so drunk you’re embarrassed about what you did at the time, or maybe it’s someone who you didn’t like them to begin with and there’s no reason to continue the relationship. Regardless, I always hear these stories from my friends or their friends about being sick, having some horrible midterm, and if that wasn’t bad enough, they ran into you-know-who on campus. You always see the ones you don’t want to see the most, am I right?
With this notion in mind, hooking up with classmates seems especially taboo. A week ago, I was chatting about this with one of my classmates and I asked if the rumors I heard about him were true. Another classmate, my neighbor, had told me he was secretly dating another girl in our class, that they were inseparable but kept their romance under wraps. He laughed and denied it, but said he did think about it at one point.
“We’re really good friends,” he told me, “and finally I decided I didn’t want to screw that up. I mean, we’re in the same class.”
I didn’t tell him I’ve slept with two other people in our class and that I don’t feel weird about it at all. I don’t know why, maybe I didn’t want to be contradictory, maybe I was scared he’d be shocked or something. But I’ve never really wanted to avoid anyone I’ve slept with or have any problem seeing them again. My foray into romance with my classmates just affirms that — I enjoy seeing them in class even more now that we’ve slept together.
Then again, my sexual habits are probably somewhat atypical. I don’t hook up while drunk, I don’t sleep with people who I’m not already either interested in or friends with. Generally speaking, I would be more inclined to see someone I’ve slept with than less.
My coworker friend and I agree on this. She says she feels more comfortable with people after she’s hooked up with them, that even if they aren’t close or don’t hang out much, when she does see them she’s at ease because of their history. But then again, we also agree that friendship is better than romance. We’re both more interested in becoming closer to our friends than finding explicit sexual or romantic partners right now.
We came up with a metaphor that I think works well. Relationships — friendships, romances, acquaintances, whatever — are like climbing a ladder. At the bottom when you just meet someone, you could just as easily climb higher or step off — no harm done either way. But, if you climb up and actually get to know them, you get the thrill of being high off the ground with the added security of having both hands and feet anchored to the rungs. Falling off the ladder at this point would be painful — losing a friend always is — but it’s also pretty difficult to lose.
Romance is when you climb to the very top of the ladder, hands free. It’s the most thrilling of these options, but by far the most precarious. A stiff breeze could make you lose your footing and if you fall from that height, if you decide to separate completely from someone you’ve forged a real connection with, the pain is much more intense.
Our strategy, my coworker and I, was to forge friendships that could venture into romance sometimes so that we get both the security of camaraderie as well as the thrill of romance. I feel that way currently with my two classmates. Most of the time we’re somewhere comfortably in the middle, but intermittently, we get the thrill of climbing a little higher together. And because of it, we all feel more comfortable with each other. To all you skeptics, it’s only awkward if you make it awkward.

As a university recommitting itself to inclusion, USC has seen much progress through the multiple diversity measures implemented over the past academic year. On Tuesday, Provost Michael Quick released a comprehensive diversity inclusion memorandum regarding the progress of racial and socioeconomic  inclusion on campus. However, though comprehensive, these initiatives do not encompass gender fluidity or transgender rights. Luckily, a new initiative by USC may be the beginning of a more inclusive campus culture, around not just race, but also gender.
As Trojans walk around campus over the last few weeks, they may have noticed an increase in the gray signage on restrooms labeled as “All Gender Restroom.” These restrooms allow transgender and gender-nonconforming people to use bathrooms void of gender identity. They are nonexclusive to cisgender people and provide an environment without judgement or stigma.
USC has been transforming single occupancy restrooms to gender-neutral restrooms since 2011, and there are now single-stalled gender-neutral restrooms in more than 13 buildings on campus. However, there are only two buildings — the United University Church and Hedco Neurosciences Building —  that have multi-stalled gender-neutral restrooms.
Implementing a campus-wide policy to transform all single occupancy restrooms into gender-inclusive restrooms is a step in the right direction for USC. It is the role of the University to make all students feel safe and welcome, whether that involves racial or gender diversity. USC was one of the first universities in the nation to add gender identity and expression to its nondiscrimination policy in 2004. As a result, the Gender Equality National Index for Universities and Schools highlighted USC as a diversity leader in this field in 2006.
But these efforts should not stop here. USC should live up to its status as a diversity leader and focus on transforming all multistall restrooms on campus to all-gender restrooms to further diversify our campus and allow for freedom of gender expression.
Central buildings on campus, such as Doheny Memorial Library, Von Kleinsmid Library and Leavey Library should be the first buildings to transform all multi-stall restrooms into gender-neutral restrooms. These libraries are central study hubs for students and should be addressed first for accessibility and convenience to students.
USC Libraries Associate Dean for Planning and Communications Hugh McHarg told the Daily Trojan that the push for gender-neutral restrooms first began in Doheny with the implementation of gender-neutral single occupancy restrooms on the first floor. He said that single occupancy restrooms are easier and faster to convert to gender-neutral restrooms than multi-stall restrooms, which require a more comprehensive look at space and the facilities available.
McHarg also said USC Libraries is planning on expanding all-gender, multi-stall restrooms in Leavey as well, in the coming months.
Though the expansion is a major achievement in all gender inclusiveness, USC is already behind the other 150 colleges and universities who have also launched and established gender-neutral restrooms across campus. The University of California system is the first university system in the United States to designate all single-stall restrooms as gender-neutral at all of its campuses.
These inclusive measures send a positive message to not only the USC community, but also the general Los Angeles community as well by defining USC as an institution that supports diversity and inclusion. By providing a safe place for all genders, transgender people and gender-nonconforming individuals, USC confirming its support to these communities.
The rise of gender-neutral restrooms at USC and comparable universities has broader implications. As a society, we are moving away from a narrow-minded notion of binary gender and moving into a new era of acceptance, which fosters individual growth, creativity and expression. This growth is a positive turning point in our country’s fight for social justice and LGBTQ rights and will influence future generations to grow up accepting all genders as the norm.
How is it that women have suddenly regressed back to a time when men could tell us what to do, what to wear, how to behave and now, with whom we must go to the bathroom or take a shower? This is a true war on women if there ever was one. Secondly, how do gender-neutral bathrooms keep transgenders safe? They say they were getting beat up in the men’s room but men will still be able to enter a gender-neutral bathroom. Also, single stall toilets are safe by definition…there is no one else in there with you so why do they need to be designated “gender-neutral?” This whole thing is just a rebellious attempt at disruption for it’s own sake. I hope students are smart enough to see how they’re being manipulated for a political agenda that is not in their best interest.
What a load of crap and wasted resources. No doubt reflected in higher campus fees you are feeling so good about.  For those not in a trust fund or on academic/sports scholarship, your loan payments will rival your house payments when you join the real world.  Enjoy the grey bathrooms.

This letter is a response to the letter to the editor in the Daily Trojan on March 29 voicing the common misconception that students protesting tuition hikes “can’t have their cake and eat it too.” That letter to the editor presents a false dichotomy. Unfortunately, student, worker and teacher services do not directly correlate to tuition. When we pay tuition on our e-bills, the money does not go directly to salaries or amenities — it goes through a bureaucratic system before moving on to the Board of Trustees and other governing bodies that decide how to budget USC’s wealth.
Consequently, USC can freely spend on projects it chooses to value, such as football, a new University Village, high administrative salaries and lawsuits. USC has entire teams of people dedicated to fundraising and receives millions in donations every year; according to the Council for Aid to Education, USC has maintained its status in the nation’s top three universities for fundraising totals for several years, raising over $653 million in 2015 and $732 million in 2014. This is why providing services and lowering tuition are not directly at odds with each other. Demanding basic services for students and workers from a wealthy, prestigious institution is not outrageous or surprising; it’s expected.
The question is not whether USC has the money — it’s what it chooses to value and to spend money on. Rather than a Sprinkles Cupcakes in the new UV, USC could choose to reallocate some funds towards diversity initiatives and workers’ salaries. Rather than a top-heavy administration with astronomical salaries, USC could choose to alleviate tuition or at least freeze it for the time being. Other schools, like Stanford, have just as many scholarships and resources as USC, fund diversity initiatives, pay their workers a living wage and still have lower tuition than us. We’re not asking for free college by tomorrow. We’re asking for a tuition freeze until issues of transparency and accountability can be resolved. This is the only way we will know if USC is in fact spending money on services that are important to students. Many claim that the cost of attendance is rising in order to meet student demands, but they have no more guarantee or affirmation than we do that USC is in fact spending our money on reforms advocated for by students. If that were the case, USC would have no reason to be so vague about its finances. If there is a good reason for a tuition hike, students should be consulted about such a decision, and USC should have the courtesy to explain the increase to all students.
Moreover, the Campus Climate Resolution specifically stipulated that the $100 million fund would not raise tuition but would only come from fundraising or donations: “The University of Southern California will earmark donations from its $6 billion endowment goal to provide for the measures listed above and no moneys will be diverted away from current student resources and initiatives for underrepresented populations (i.e. cultural centers), BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the University of Southern California will implement the measures listed above, contingent on the necessary funds being supplied without raising student tuition or through the application of additional student fees.”
Apart from the fact that USC has yet to deliver on the demands of the Campus Climate Resolution, we shouldn’t have to pay more than we already do for a campus free from discrimination, sexual assault and exploitation of workers. Lower tuition and access are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, one cannot state that the tuition hike is an economic necessity, especially considering the fact that our tuition has been rising at a rate much higher than inflation (the cumulative inflation rate from 2012 to 2015 was 3.9 percent while undergraduate tuition at USC rose 11.6 percent over the same period), and that an increase of $2,000 per student will bring in only about $86 million per year (a generous estimate) — which represents only 2 percent of the estimated $4.2 billion university budget for 2015. So with a tuition hike that is an insignificant blip in the University’s overall funding, but has disastrous effects on the lives of students and their families, USC is deliberately making the choice to reduce access to education.
The issues of college affordability and campus climate are interrelated; it is important now more than ever to advocate for both. Affordable education and a safe, inclusive campus are not trivial baked goods that might be nice to have as a treat; they are fundamental rights that affect people’s lives every day. Students shouldn’t have to choose between them.

When it comes to tuition costs, the law of supply and demand comes into play.  USC is no longer the University of Second Choice as it was called a few decades ago.  Now, prospective students from around the world are competing for a limited number of spots at USC — their first choice.  Could the university choose to subsidize the cost of attending USC?  Yes, it already does in the form of scholarships, grants, and other assistance.  Should it do so for every single student?  No, why should it?  Students have hundreds of choices when it comes to higher education, many of which are cheaper than others.  Students should not be surprised by tuition costs.  The costs of attending a college or university should be one of the many factors students look at as they choose where to apply.  See the beauty of competition in the marketplace?    
If students learned basic economic principles in high school, this type of misunderstanding would not occur.  Hopefully they take one or two courses while they are in college.  It will save them much grief later on in life as they realize there is no such thing as a free lunch.

Music festival season may be upon us, but right around the corner is finals week! Check out these four apps to help you ace it: 
Quizlet
I have terrible handwriting and would always hate having to guess what my illegible note cards really said before I started using Quizlet. Now, I make “study sets” online. The mobile app and mobile website sync seamlessly with your devices so you can use your sets while on the go. Quizlet also has a wide variety of different study modes you can play with so you can try beating the clock with flashcard matches or even take spelling tests. Pro-tip: search your class name before creating your own. I’ve stumbled upon public sets created by older students before!
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
EasyBib
I haven’t manually created a bibliography since junior high school and might not ever again as long as I have EasyBib. This web application creates simple forms to fill out for your sources and then generates perfectly formatted, alphabetized bibliographies in APA, MLA or Chicago style. With many websites, EasyBib can automatically figure out most of the necessary information after being given just a URL!

SelfControl
SelfControl is a free application for Mac OS X that lets you self-select specific websites to block for any period of time. Simply add the targeted sites, start your timer and use the internet without temptations.

News Feed Eradicator for Facebook
Of course, completely swearing off Facebook during finals week isn’t totally viable for many of us. There’s often Facebook groups for classes or group chats for school projects. News Feed Eradicator replaces your never-ending news feed with a motivational quote so you can hop onto the social media site, check your notifications and avoid getting side-tracked.
