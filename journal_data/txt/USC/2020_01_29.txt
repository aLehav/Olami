Few directors are as simultaneously inoffensive and respected as USC alumnus Ron Howard. As far as Academy Awards winners go, the man behind the camera of “A Beautiful Mind” is arguably the most reliable and least risky — in terms of both his creative and personal life — of the past two decades. There’s a chance that even fellow Oscar-winner Frank Capra is rolling around in his grave somewhere, next to his little gold statues, screaming “Come on, Howie! Stop playing it so safe!” 
 Howard does not have a signature writing style like Quentin Tarantino, a signature shot composition like Alejandro Iñárritu or a signature subject matter like Martin Scorsese. But he’s universally cited as a delight to work with. In fact, his reputation as a good guy is probably the most reputable part of his legacy as a filmmaker. What he lacks in flourish, he makes up for in unconditional empathy for his actors and, consequently, his characters.
 His acute focus on humanity plays out perfectly in his latest film. One of the most anticipated documentaries of the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, “Rebuilding Paradise” is a harrowing portrait of the approximately 26,000 Northern California residents whose lives were upended by the Camp fire of 2018. The feature is all the more heartbreaking and thought-provoking when its mercilessly cruel series of circumstances are juxtaposed — not by a complex mastery of cinematic language or an abstract approach to the disaster-relief movie but by Howard’s simple, unabridged kindness.
 “Rebuilding Paradise” feels immersive, multidimensional and real from the very first frame. Its opening sequence is downright apocalyptic: An ember grows into a blaze, which grows into an all-consuming inferno, claiming more and more structures and lives with each passing minute. Before the title card even hits, we watch, mostly through personal iPhone videos and dashcam footage, people swiftly evacuating from their homes. It is one of the most gut-wrenching sequences ever captured in a film.
 And what’s so haunting is the fact that most of the sequence could be done in silence and still be equally effective. Howard didn’t sign on to make the documentary until he knew about the reconstruction of Paradise (and no, that’s not just a cute title, the town is actually named Paradise). So, the cinematography of the smoky destruction is clunky at best. But Howard knows that stakes don’t come from horrific visuals — they come from how people feel about those visuals.
 Even when the screen is mostly just a red fog, hearing recorded 911 conversations of a woman unsure of how to evacuate her disabled father in time is petrifying. It’s also petrifying to hear the horns of congested traffic and people praying to flee the scene before their car windows literally melt. The audience can understand what’s happening through the sound of cops, desperate to help but faced with horror outside of their control, encouraging certain damned parties to evacuate on foot because they simply will not last long enough otherwise. And it’s hard not to weep along to a vision so horrid. 
 The rest of “Rebuilding Paradise” is composed of watching people grieve and reinvent. It’s not a new post-disaster narrative. In fact, it’s pretty much the only post-disaster narrative. 
 We’ve seen it in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. We’ve seen it in Haiti after the earthquake — and those communities had way bigger hills to climb after the devastation than Paradise, but  again, Howard’s skill is not showing scale, it’s showing people. His crew manages to make the subjects of this documentary feel safe and cared for, which many attendees attested to during the Q&A after the film’s debut screening. 
 In turn, his subjects feel comfortable sharing private and more complex thoughts with us. For example, one resident was ready to have a child with her significant other, and even though her house wasn’t burned, Paradise was no longer a healthy, suitable place to raise a child. Does she move? Where does she move to? How does she accumulate the resources to move? How will she feel if she abandons her home to move? These are difficult questions that lesser filmmakers would be too focused on capturing the damage to raise. Thank God, though, that Howard is a master behind the camera and explored those thoughts.
 This film is also surprisingly and unintentionally political. Because of Howard’s good rapport with the community, he’s able to capture members at their lowest lows. Many of these characters hit rock bottom at surprising times in their journey. The heroes of “Rebuilding Paradise” do not necessarily have happy endings: Many get what they want but lose more than they bargained for along the way. By the end, the theme of the film is less about overcoming hardship through elbow grease and more about how trying it is to fix something that’s already broken. As the saying goes, “an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.” 
 It’s no secret that global warming was a major contributor to the Camp Fire. Many people will walk away with the message that one of the stars of the documentary, Carly Jean Ingersoll, gave in the aforementioned Q&A. 
 “Instead of reacting to these [climate] crises, what can we do before?” Ingersoli said.
 Nobody, including himself would have expected Howard to make a film with such an effective political message. He insists that he is not a “policy maker,” which makes him almost the perfect person to deliver such a timely and important message about saving the planet. He doesn’t try to bombard the audience with political statements. He doesn’t alienate. The politics aren’t the center of his filmmaking — the people are the center. But watching these people so intimately, it’s hard not to be inspired to get involved.

The Undergraduate Student Government presented an amendment to one of its bylaws at its Tuesday meeting to allow underrepresented groups on campus to become cultural assemblies. The amendment, which was presented by Director of Accessibility Affairs Gwen Howard, would allow student organizations such as the Native American Student Union to become part of its programming branch and receive recognition and funding from USG. 
“This provides another [cultural assembly pathway],” Howard said.  “If you don’t have five member organizations … you can still illustrate student interest and student engagement with the issue at hand and have all of the privileges that are afforded to USG assemblies.” 
The amendment would allow a cultural organization to become an assembly with a petition signed by fifty undergraduates as an alternative to meeting the current requirement of having five recognized student organizations on campus be affiliated with the cultural organization. 
Vice President of NASU Moakeah Rivera said that this will allow her organization, which represents students who make up 1% of the student body, to have a voice within USG and campus. 
“As Native Americans we’re a minority of a minority in our own country,” Rivera said. “And yet, when we are on our land we aren’t treated fairly. Even though we’re a small population here at USC, we still have 30 plus members and according to USC, there’s over 285 [Native Americans] at USC. We are still a group of students… [who] should participate in voting and … become an assembly.”
USG also announced that they are in the process of hiring a new election commissioner. Additionally, Chief Diversity Officer Jeffrey Cho said that he is in the process of hiring a co-director for external affairs and an assistant director for wellness affairs for the advocacy team. 
Senior Director of Communications Truman Fritz presented his updates on the executive team’s efforts in restructuring USG from January to March. USG members hope to improve the organization by combining the advocacy and legislative branches, allowing for senators and members of the advocacy team to work together on more focused efforts. 
 “I think it gives us better leverage and better alignment on being able to reach administrators effectively,” Fritz said. “It’s going to help bring people together across different teams, and I think that’ll just make it better for us to be able to reach administrators and make actual change on campus.” 
Sen. Angela Chuang spoke on the coronavirus incident that occurred Monday night where false information was spread through email and social media, including xenophobic memes about the international community on campus. Chuang also asked senators and students in attendance to be aware of posts they share on the virus.
 “I want to remind everyone and encourage everyone to be mindful about what you’re sharing …  on social media because a lot of these posts are very anti-Asian,” Chuang said. “Our international student population and our Asian American student population are being affected by this because [we’re worried about our] relatives back in Asia.”

Following rumors that a case of coronavirus broke out near USC Monday night, the University affirmed that news of an outbreak would not come from an apartment management team but from L.A. County public health authorities first.
On Monday night, students feared that the virus may have spread to the USC community after off-campus housing complex The Lorenzo emailed tenants erroneously stating that a resident had contracted the virus. 
Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said that if an individual from the USC community were to contract the virus, Student Health would first inform the Los Angeles Department of Public Health, which would inform the public of any development involving the coronavirus.
“The Department of Public Health is the only agency that has the authority to release the results,” Van Orman told the Daily Trojan. “In the event that there were students affected, they would let us know. They would put out a public press release like we saw over the weekend for the non-USC … individual.”
Health officials confirmed two cases of coronavirus in Los Angeles and Orange counties Sunday. There has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission in these two cases. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control is investigating more than 100 potential cases of coronavirus, with five cases confirmed, 70 under investigation and 32 with negative results. However, no one affiliated with USC is currently under investigation, Van Orman said.
Lorenzo resident Mayra Huerta, a senior majoring in human biology, said she got back to her apartment near 8:30 p.m. and saw multiple ambulance vehicles outside. When her friends sent her a screenshot of the email, she said she felt fearful. 
“All my roommates, we all came out, we all freaked out,” Huerta said. “We all took out the Clorox wipes and disinfected everything, and we were kind of panicking, and it was just like a state of panic.”
Posts about the false outbreak filled social media, including the USC memes page on Facebook. One on the memes page read “University of Spreading Coronavirus” and another included a photo depicting fake face masks engraved with USC’s initials.
Several racist and xenophobic memes have circulated on the University’s Facebook meme page and a Latinx group chat, targeting Asian students because of the virus’ origin in China. While the virus originated there, Van Orman said targeting Chinese international students with hateful comments about the illness is problematic and only exacerbates panic surrounding the disease.
“We’re very concerned that we’re hearing that students from China or students from the Wuhan province are being targeted,” Van Orman said. “It’s very easy to try to kind of point fingers at a group of people or individuals and think that if we just keep them away that somehow we’ll all be safe, and that’s really dangerous and discriminatory.”
These memos were also addressed at Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government Meeting during which Sen. Angela Chuang asked attendees to be mindful of what they post online.
“Our international student population and our Asian American student population are being affected by this because [we’re worried about our] relatives back in Asia,” she told meeting attendees.
On the night of the false alarm, some concerned students created a petition requesting that USC cancel classes. It garnered nearly 10,000 signatures.
In addition to Huerta, other students reported seeing paramedics and members of the Los Angeles Fire Department outside the apartment complex that evening. According to DPS Daily Crime and Fire Logs, a student was transported to a local hospital near 9 p.m. after reporting a sore throat and fatigue.
The Lorenzo later retracted their notice, apologizing for the release of false information. The Lorenzo declined to further comment on the incident and redirected communication to USC Media Relations. 
Huerta said she was initially confused when USC reported that there was a false alarm and that she wanted an additional confirmation from The Lorenzo. Once she received the second email from the apartment complex, she and her roommates felt relieved, she said.
“I wish … they would’ve just confirmed reports before sending an email,” Huerta said. “It would have been helpful because I feel like a lot of people freaked out. And I know a lot of [locals] got in their cars and went home.”
Van Orman said the ill student was screened for coronavirus symptoms through a checklist developed by the L.A. County Department of Public Health per protocol, saying what occurred on the scene may have led to miscommunication. 
Van Orman explained that while there are at least five confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S., the situation is not as severe as it is in Wuhan, China, and other parts of the nation, where the virus first spread.
USC is currently working with LADPH to monitor developments in Los Angeles. L.A. has not placed a quarantine for those returning from Wuhan or any affected areas. However, Van Orman encourages individuals experiencing symptoms to seek immediate medical care.
“There’s social distancing,” she said. “I think there’s confusion because of the measures being taken in China, where they have a localized population with thousands of cases, versus the measures that we might, for example, take in the United States, where we have had a handful of cases that have been contained. They’re very different situations.”
USC Student Health plans to increase communication to continue to ease student concerns on the outbreak and relay the preventative measures being taken. 
Natalie Oganesyan and Kate Sequeira contributed to the report.

Actress Lori Loughlin pleaded not guilty again Monday in Boston federal court to the three charges she faces in the admissions scandal after allegedly gaining her daughters’ admission to USC as false athletic recruits. 
In the filing, Loughlin’s defense waived her court appearance scheduled for Jan. 27 and entered into a not guilty plea in response to a fourth superseding indictment filed Jan. 14. 
“Defendant and her counsel affirm that Ms. Loughlin has received a copy of the Fourth Superseding Indictment and that Ms. Loughlin pleads not guilty to each of the counts against her,” the court arraignment waiver read.
The indictment charges Loughlin, her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, and 17 other parents involved in the case with 13 counts. Among them, Loughlin and Giannulli face charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery and conspiracy to commit money laundering for paying $500,000 to gain their daughters admission through crew.
In a separate motion also filed Monday, defense representing admissions case parents Loughlin, Giannulli, investor William McGlashan Jr. and businessman John Wilson requested a three-day extension to its Friday deadline by which they are required to submit court documents. The documents will support the defenses’ Jan. 14 request for the federal government to release further evidence relevant to Loughlin’s case, in which the defendants accused the prosecution of misrepresenting the money they paid for their children’s admission.
The motion, which asks the court to extend the deadline until Friday, stated that the additional time would allow the defense to review motion and report documents the government released Monday. It also asked that the government respond to the defendants’ filing by Feb. 7.
According to court documents, the defendants have requested evidence from the federal government regarding information admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer gave to the parents about the objective behind the payments they made for their children’s admission. The parents alleged Singer had told them the money that would fund a legitimate nonprofit organization, a claim that may challenge the bribery charges, according to the defense in court documents.
Both have maintained not-guilty pleas since their first indictment in March, and the couple allege the prosecution is withholding information relevant to the defendants’ case, a claim the government has refuted.
Loughlin and Giannulli are among 15 parents of the 36 named in the admissions case to decline a plea deal and stand trial in federal court. Unless the couple reverse their plea, the federal government may ask their daughters, Isabella and Olivia Jade, to testify. The sisters attended USC before news of the scandal broke in March but are no longer enrolled, the University confirmed in October.
The case’s next status hearing is scheduled for Feb. 27 in Boston federal court.

Kolton Nephew, a sophomore majoring in political science, grew up on the Navajo Nation reservation in Arizona’s Four Corners region. After transferring from Fort Worth College, a school with a 27% Native American student body, Nephew said he experienced culture shock. 
USC is composed of a student body that is 1% Native American, according to a diversity breakdown published by the University in 2016 — a stark difference from Nephew’s first school.
“I didn’t know how to react with so many different cultures around me or not seeing familiar faces or familiar languages spoken,” Nephew said. “I felt like I needed to at least connect with people who had a similar background as me, if not the same nation as me.”
As an active member of USC’s Native American Student Union since Fall 2019, Nephew found community in the organization and with its 30 active members, who identify with the club’s goal of establishing a cultural center for Native American students and others interested in Native American issues and culture.
However, NASU has repeatedly been denied recognition as an Undergraduate Student Government cultural assembly because of a bylaw that requires that a group be affiliated with five recognized student organizations to become an assembly. But this  may change following a proposed amendment to the bylaw,  allowing organizations to submit a petition of at least 50 signatures to become an assembly under USG.
“[We’re] trying to revise this process so that it’s more feasible for smaller communities on campus to become cultural assemblies,” USG Chief Diversity Officer Jeffrey Cho said. “[We’re] thinking about creating this petition system where, potentially, if enough students sign this petition, then [NASU is] allowed to start the process of becoming a cultural assembly.”
The organization is currently categorized as a religious group.
“[NASU members are] passionate and determined, and in an institution that still doesn’t really choose to recognize us, we’re limited to a religious center,” Nephew said. “That’s demoralizing to us as Native Americans — saying that what we are is more of a religion than who we are as a lifestyle.”
Chase said she also noticed how limited Native American student resources are at USC compared to her high school, which was located near her Navajo reservation. 
“Back at my high school, we had so much support for different Native American groups,” Chase said. “We would host powwows, ceremonies, all the time. It was such a weird transition coming here to USC when none of that is present. It’s opened my eyes, and it’s made me want to bring that kind of community here.” 
For some, the challenges of their Native American identities began before college. Vice President Moakeah Rivera said that growing up in the affluent community of Encinitas, she was patronized and treated differently from her peers.
“I was raised in a very privileged area where I was a token,” Rivera said. “I was only treated nicely because I was the only [Native American].” 
Rivera said tensions between Native American groups and other communities develop when non-Native Americans perceive that Native Americans are receiving special treatment, such as affirmative action. However, she said these policies are necessary to close the gaps in educational opportunities.
“Native Americans are the least funded in their education systems — we’re separated from the rest of the world,” Rivera said. “There’s a lot of things that affect us in our college, in our childhoods that other people can’t understand.”
Chase added that Native Americans receive comparatively little recognition in postsecondary education.
“I think it’s just the struggle that Native American students face in general when it comes to pursuing a second education,” Chase said. “[You’re] always trying to find a little crack, a sliver through to be able to catch up with everyone else.”
While acquiring resources and members are high on the group’s agenda, its main goal is to transition as a member of the Interfaith Council — an umbrella organization of religious groups on campus — to a cultural assembly under USG, like the Black and Latinx student assemblies. 
“We would have a greater voice in how we are represented [if we became an assembly],” Rivera said. “We would also get funding, which would actually help us greatly with advocating and our outreach work … We just want to be treated like every other ethnic group within USG.” 
Chase said she was frustrated with the common argument that NASU’s membership is too small to establish it as a cultural assembly.
“We have been told that we don’t have the numbers to be able to make that transition and make our presence known, which is unfortunate because …  it’s not something that we have control over,” Chase said. “Being able to have [the University’s] support would mean so much.” 
At its core, NASU membership is a way for students with common experiences to share their culture and build a community, Chase said.
“When you look at Native American cultures, we’re so family oriented,” Chase said. “It’s just so hard to be away from that, so when we come here as a group of people, we’re able to create our own little family. We’re able to keep our culture, which is amazing.”

For a “Harry Potter” fanatic like myself, I often wish that Hogwarts actually existed — that I was there right now cracking jokes with the Weasley family and learning spells in Charms class; that I was buying my first wand from Ollivanders, figuring out what exactly fits my personality; that I was partaking in the Triwizard Tournament, showcasing my magical prowess and ability to cope with danger.  
But then I remember the pain and heartbreak I went through when Dobby was knifed and passed away in front of Harry, after Fred Weasley died during the explosion and as Snape murdered Albus Dumbledore with his last words being “Severus … please.” My 12-year-old heart broke as I read through the death scenes of my favorite characters. 
So to those who say fiction is nothing like real life, I disagree.
Death is a subject shared universally between realms, linking fiction with reality. While the concept may be difficult to comprehend in its full nature, fiction continues to expose us to such heavy topics. It’s almost as if it prepares us for the inevitable in our own lives. 
The literary world is anything but make-believe. While the genre itself describes imaginary events and people, fiction feels honest and alive. Cognitive psychologist and researcher Keith Oatley proposed that reading produces a simulation of reality for readers similar to the way simulations run on computers. With its extreme detail, vivid imagery and rich descriptions of characters, fiction invites readers to enter the lives of other people and understand their thoughts. 
Researchers such as Oatley have empirically shown us the magnanimous power of fiction; fiction teaches us to empathize, shapes us to be more inclusive, trains us to think more creatively and, most importantly, shows us how to navigate the real world. 
Reading fiction welcomes us to social relationships and environments that mirror reality. In my column, I’ll work to bridge the path between fictitious prose and today’s society, highlighting the applicable life lessons fiction communicates to us. 
Let me begin with the first life lesson fiction taught me at the age of 12 as I dove into the wizarding world of “Harry Potter”: Life is too short to sit around and do nothing. 
Through the seven-volume series, I became friends with every character, both new and familiar faces appeared as the chapters unfolded. I looked forward to Fred and George’s latest pranks and to receiving wisdom from the ever-so-wise Dumbledore. Some inspired me, others intrigued me and yet a few enraged me. And naturally, their fatal departures had profound impacts on me. From being in utter disbelief when Sirius Black disappeared behind the veil, to feeling devastated when Remus Lupin died just after he found love and had a child, I quickly learned that life changes even if you aren’t ready for it. 
Time is ever-fleeting and it is up to you to decide how you want to spend it. This notion is not solely tied to fiction, but extends to every element of reality. Somebody you love and know so fondly could easily vanish from existence. This life lesson has never been more evident to me as I grapple with the passing of Kobe Bryant — a hero not only to me, but arguably to the entirety of Los Angeles (maybe even the country). Though I didn’t know him personally — knowing what I knew from reading about him, watching him and listening to him — his passing broke me physically and mentally, similar to the way I broke when my Hogwarts comrades faced the same fate. 
Yes, I can differentiate between what is real and what is fake. And no, I am in no way comparing Kobe to literary characters. Instead, I point to the same feelings of sadness, emptiness and tragedy that encompasses their passing. In both scenarios, I am forced to cope with the principle of how short life can truly be. 
What Kobe and the characters from “Harry Potter” share is that they all were actively working toward achieving ever-changing goals. They were not sitting idly, waiting for something to happen. And no longer am I. 
So to those — myself included — guilty of waiting until tomorrow to do things or pushing work aside because you think, “I’ll have time next week,” I urge you all to remember how fragile life is. Unfortunately, we don’t know how much time we have left and we can’t be sure we’ll have next week to do what we planned to do.

A teenage girl with a stutter falls in love with her gender non-conforming speech therapist. Lighthearted, laughable chaos ensues. Such is the story driving “Spit it Out, Margot!,” one of this year’s senior thesis projects in the School of Cinematic Arts production program which is currently in the beginning stages of production. Oh, and to top everything off, it’s a musical. 
But the crew behind the film was not featured in The Hollywood Reporter last month because of the short’s fun plot or ambitious musical numbers. Rather, “Spit it Out, Margot!” sparked a social media stir because it is the first undergraduate senior thesis project in the cinema school’s 90-year history to have an above-the-line crew consisting entirely of women and gender non-conforming people. 
“We didn’t intend to be all female,” said producer Caroline Quien, a senior majoring in film production. “It wasn’t like, ‘Hey let’s do that.’ It literally was like only women are reaching out, and they’re all reaching out because they’re pissed off, and they feel like nobody is listening to them.”
The story of “Spit it Out, Margot!” stems from the mind of screenwriter Miriam Sachs, a senior majoring in film production. For the music and lyrics, she collaborated with alumnus Zack Hernandez, who majored in jazz piano. Hernandez said watching his songs come to life on the screen is a dream come true. 
“I could never have imagined that something like this could happen,” Hernandez said. “It just didn’t cross my mind. And now that it’s actually being made, it’s really feeling like reality now.” 
The process of crafting a senior film thesis spans the course of an entire academic year. During the summer, screenwriters, like Sachs, develop their ideas and begin writing scripts. In the fall, writers pitch their scripts to their “Advanced Production Workshop” classes. At this point, producers like Quien and Madison Holbrook, a senior majoring in film production and another of the film’s producers, can attach themselves to projects that resonate with them. Directors then make their pitches to production teams and screenwriters, where Ella Harris, a senior majoring in film production, sold Sachs, Quien and Holbrook on her vision for “Spit it Out, Margot!” 
“I came into the film school in general with a very concrete idea of the kinds of stories I wanted to tell,” Harris said. “And to be honest, this was kinda one of the only queer stories to be pitched in class. For me that was a huge thing. As a queer person myself, these are the stories that I’m drawn to.” 
But finding an incredible production team only marks the beginning of a film thesis’ journey. In the winter, Quien, Holbrook, Harris and Sachs pitched the film to a faculty panel who decided which films will receive funding for the spring semester. “Spit it Out, Margot!” is one of four films selected for funding this semester with production having started in mid-January and a premiere date set for May 14. 
“We’re getting an incredible opportunity from the school to make an all-female project, and everyone has been supportive,” Sachs said. “I feel very grateful that this has always had legs.” 
Sachs and the rest of the project’s production team cite members of the SCA faculty, ranging from teaching assistants to professors, as sources of support and mentorship throughout their tenures in the film production program. The team credited adjunct associate professor Mary Posatko as an instructor who pushed them to come into their own as storytellers and champion their own stories. Professor Brenda Goodman guided them through the thesis process and adjunct professor David McKendry also provided them with skills and encouragement. 
In spite of this outpouring of support from SCA, the team behind “Margot” recognizes the pressure placed on young women looking to pursue careers behind the camera. 
“It’s tiring to have to constantly prove yourself and need people to also prove that you can do it,” Holbrook said. “Like you can’t just prove yourself, you need other people to validate [you].” 
Part of the production team’s goal with “Margot” is to combat the biases against women and gender non-conforming folks in the film industry. 
“There have been all-male crews before and nobody bats an eye, and we are looking to flip the scales and see what it’s like to make it different,” Harris said. “It’s like a science experiment, we just want to see what happens doing it the other way.” 
The project serves as a case study for the all-female crew as well as a set environment that is predominantly influenced by women, Harris said. Harris hopes to cultivate a set culture that is different from past sets the team have worked on, beginning with an added emphasis on self-care. Through practices such as daily meditation, the producers hope to foster a positive environment for creative expression. More importantly, they strive for a set where crewmembers are able to expand their knowledge and improve their filmmaking. 
“We’re trying to cultivate a space, we’re trying to cultivate a crew set, a set culture, where women feel comfortable taking space, and learning and asking questions and growing,” Harris said. 
In addition to the attention generated by The Hollywood Reporter interview, the women and non-conforming individuals working on “Margot” are cognizant of their responsibility as historical firsts, Harris said. However, rather than view the added eyes as pressure, the filmmakers welcome the outside attention. 
“It’s fun to watch people see the process because to us, so much of “Spit it Out, Margot!” is not just this incredible script that we get to bring to life, but the actual production, which is the all-women part,” Harris said. “That’s the part that we do want people to see.” 
Overall, the team said it embraces the project in its totality, from its heartfelt script to its significance in the history of SCA. For the women and non-conforming people that make up its team, it marks a moment of self-realization, Sachs said. 
“Women have been trained to make themselves smaller, to take care of others. And that’s what Margot, the main character of the film does: She makes herself smaller and doesn’t speak at all,” Sachs said.  “I guess this film and also Margot’s journey is about taking up our expansive space  and stepping into our own power and having confidence.”

What is “Summertime?”
“Summertime” is a hunt for juicy cheeseburgers. It’s swans floating in Echo Park, drenched in the amber light of California dusk. It’s emo folk songs on public transportation and graffiti art. It’s car sex under shimmering fireworks and uncouth therapy. It’s a celebration of home.
If that feels like a preposterous way to begin a film review, good, because “Summertime,” the newest work by director Carlos Lopéz Estrada that premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival this weekend, is a preposterous movie. It is also poetic — in every sense of the word. All the aforementioned metaphors aren’t just metaphors; they’re literal events and images that take place during the movie. It is also uplifting, quixotic, confrontational, awkward, funny, woke, clumsy and, above all, original. It is an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to cinema and, because of this, it somehow stylistically, tonally and thematically hybridizes “Rent” and “Love Actually.”
The premise is simple: real Southern California teenagers spending time in L.A., a metropolis they all have a deeply personal relationship with, over the summer. But they’re not just teenagers. They’re poets — really talented poets of different ethnic backgrounds, sexualities and genders who all have their own style and voice and share them in their own distinctive way.
The piece functions like a series of vignettes, each climaxing in a soliloquy from a young player involved. Some of these poems are silly; some are deeply moving; others aren’t quite sure what they are, but all come from an authentic place and do their best to capture the true darkness and ecstasy of being a young person in a heavily fantasized city (hence the “Rent” similarities).
Many of these vignettes all weave together by the end of the picture. Estrada’s camera effortlessly moves from the wrap-up of one character’s storyline to another’s in a way that is swift, efficient and a bit overwhelming. Like “Love Actually,” it’s all cyclical, tidying itself up in one complete narrative by the end like clockwork, which is an even more resonant statement once you see the film.
Estrada deserves commendation for his choice to make this movie. Fresh off the universal critical acclaim from “Blindspotting,” he could’ve easily capitalized on that momentum to make another tightly-polished film in which he had complete creative control. But he didn’t. Not only did he focus on capturing a completely different story, he trusted several new young minds to be the storytellers. 
The 25 spoken word poets in “Summertime” are not professional actors. The words they speak and perform are entirely their own. They were mentored through the “Get Lit” program, a California-based nonprofit aimed at empowering children through literature and poetry. These young artists succeed in spades without watering down who they are. Feats of uncompromising creativity are rare, and it is a treasure to witness how much kindling Estrada provided to the sparks the “Get Lit” program has been igniting for years.
The script also deserves immense praise, the bulk of it being written by the young artists who articulate their poems with conviction. Most content about teenagers (“Freaks and Geeks,” “Eighth Grade”) often utilizes intentional awkwardness and strategically placed “um’s” to show that, no, not all teens are Aaron Sorkins spouting around wittily. While these works are wonderful, “Summertime” takes an opposite, equally delightful approach, proving there are also young people who can rival Shakespeare, using rich language to paint the world’s vocabulary “as it could be.”
And, the cast is overflowing with potential: Mila Cuda, a lyrical reincarnation of Allen Ginsberg and physical doppelganger of Saoirse Ronan, delivers verses that could genuinely shape a generation throughout film. The young Marquesha Babers’ ability to seamlessly switch from poignant and hilarious wisdom far beyond her years to quickly unraveling vulnerability elevates her to the company of Oscar-winning actresses twice her age. Tyris Winter creates a Cirque-du-Soleil-level balancing act between passionate youthful flamboyance and soft paternal empathy. It’s a candy store of debuting talent, and it would be no surprise if “Summertime” is the launching pad for several careers.
That’s what “Summertime” does right. It’s not perfect, though.
There are over two dozen artists featured in the film, each with something substantive to say and “Summertime’s” 95-minute run time is unfortunately not enough to provide the necessary breathing room for all these poems to create lasting feelings of catharsis.
In this way, the film would serve better as a series, with each episode focusing on a different character, allowing time to create a boiling tension, before exploding with character-heavy emotion like many of the poems do. Instead, some of the acidic wit in “Summertime” feels blurted out prematurely. Estrada tries to make up for this, using reaction shots and comedy, but this is one of the rare occasions where brevity is a weapon against a film.
Because spoken word poetry is such an audience-interactive art form, witnessing it in silence through a screen muffles some of its beauty. Estrada tries to substitute snaps and cheers with stunning orchestral swells and tight close-ups which the poets play like fiddles, but watch a live clip of any of these featured poems and try not to think there’s something missing.
But “Summertime’s” occasional disarray is part of its charm. The film itself functions exactly as it intends: as a love poem to L.A. written by teens. Looking back on it in five years, parts of it may seem overly sentimental, a bit angsty and lost — but so it goes with all parts of adolescence. The film does so much correctly, and it’s the first of its kind to do so. It’s dreamy-eyed, fearless and the best movie about L.A. since “La La Land.” It’s a unique coming-of-age classic worth seeing as soon as possible.
