After earning his first start last week against Arizona State, freshman defensive end Devon Kennard was given a surprising reward — a position change.
Kennard has only been playing strongside linebacker since Monday but could start for the Trojans if linebacker Michael Morgan is unable to play. Morgan sprained his right wrist and is wearing a cast. His backup, Jarvis Jones, has been ruled out of the game with a neck injury.

USC coach Pete Carroll said even if Morgan starts, Kennard will see plenty of playing time.
“He’s played on the edge a lot for us, but he’s shown that he’s paying attention in the meetings,” Carroll said. “He’s a hammer out there.”
At 6-foot-3, 255 pounds, Kennard would be USC’s biggest linebacker. The position switch has forced the freshman to embrace his new responsibilities.
“I don’t feel like there’s too much difference from the position I was playing before, just a little bit more dropping [into coverage],” Kennard said. “There’s a little more thinking as well, so there’s a learning curve. But I’ve gotten better and more comfortable every day.”
Kennard said he did not know whether the position switch would be temporary or permanent, but he was happy to have the chance to play more often. Junior Everson Griffen is slated to return this week at defensive end, which would relegate Kennard to a backup role.
The adjustment has gone well so far, Carroll said.
“It’s a lot to learn in a short amount of time, but he’s very well-equipped at that spot,” he said.
Morgan is still limited by his cast, Carroll said, but still hopes to play against Stanford.
“We’re trying to find out how comfortable he is playing with the cast,” Carroll said. “He practiced most of the time today, so I think he’s in good shape.”

Quarterbacks coach and offensive playcaller Jeremy Bates said Thursday that the USC offense would have to get back to basics if the unit wanted to get past its struggles.
The Trojans’ offense could only muster one touchdown last week against Arizona State and converted just two of 13 third-down attempts. The team has spent twice as much as normal this week on fixing its third-down woes, Carroll said.
Bates said he believed the offense had to establish a rhythm to avoid facing too many daunting situations.
“We need to get some simple completions and keep driving the ball,” Bates said. “We kept stopping ourselves and never were in sync.”
Carroll echoed those sentiments.
“You hope to go with the things you can really count on in critical situations,” he said.
Fourth-year wide receiver Damian Williams did not practice again Thursday. Carroll said the decision would “go all the way to the end of the week.”

When time expired, the freshman quarterback celebrated on the field with his teammates. He had just led his team to victory against the only remaining undefeated team in the Pac-10.
The quarterback completed 12 of 20 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns in the 51-42 shootout. He did not throw an interception.
The then-ranked No. 7 Oregon Ducks had few answers for stopping the freshman’s offensive unit, which led to a major upset.
Before the game, Oregon’s secondary coach John Neal said the quarterback was the best his team would face all season and compared him to the great Brett Favre.
Just weeks earlier, the freshman’s head coach had said in a press conference that he was “the best quarterback in the country.” That’s a heavy statement considering that Tim Tebow and Colt McCoy are still playing — last time I checked anyway.
But this quarterback didn’t disappoint last Saturday in his most important game of the season.
Redshirt freshman Andrew Luck led the Stanford football program to its most resounding statement game in years.
Around USC, we hear a lot about freshman quarterback Matt Barkley. We hear he might be one of the best quarterbacks in the country and definitely one of the best freshman quarterbacks at this time.
But how about this question: Is he even the best freshman quarterback in the conference?
Luck is a gifted athlete, with arm strength, accuracy and speed on the ground. In nine games this season, Luck has completed 126 passes for 2,076 yards and 11 touchdowns. He has only thrown three interceptions.
Barkley’s stats look quite similar.
During the eight games this season, Barkley has completed 125 passes for 1,839 yards and 10 touchdowns. He has thrown seven interceptions.
So if these two players are nearly identical stats-wise (and yes, Barkley has played in one less game), then why has Barkley gotten so much national attention when Luck has not?
Both are freshman quarterbacks. Both are in the hunt for a Pac-10 championship. And both have the faith and trust from their teammates to lead them on the field.
The answer is media coverage. USC gets way more national attention than any other program in the Pac-10 because of USC coach Pete Carroll and his program’s dominance throughout this decade.
And there’s no argument there. Carroll and the Trojans have earned the respect and attention they receive. But does that mean Barkley is a better quarterback than Luck just because he plays for the Trojans?
Nonsense.
While the stats are pretty similar between the two quarterbacks, there are three advantages that give the slight edge to Luck in the debate over who is the best freshman quarterback in the Pac-10 heading into Saturday’s matchup.
The first is fairly obvious. Luck has fewer interceptions than Barkley and leads the league in passing efficiency. Those are two pretty important stats for any quarterback.
The second point is a crucial one as well.
Luck did what Barkley couldn’t do against the Ducks. Luck brought his A-game last Saturday, and, with help from running back Toby Gerhart, the Cardinal defeated the Ducks in one of the program’s most significant wins this decade.
Barkley’s team failed in Eugene, Ore. and failed badly, suffering the worst defeat during Carroll’s tenure.
The argument can be made that Luck played at home against the Ducks and the Trojans traveled to Oregon, but considering how poorly the Trojans played, I don’t know if a home game would have made a difference.
The third — and perhaps most important — point that gives the edge to Luck is his running game. Stanford’s quarterback has compiled 227 rushing yards this season and averages 5.2 yards per carry.
Not only does Luck’s speed provide another offensive option for Stanford but it gives the defense another dimension to worry about on the other side of the ball.
“He’s got a rushing average that most quarterbacks are lucky to have,” Carroll said. “So this is a very diverse football player.”
Barkley, while very talented, is not blessed with the speed to take off down the field. In fact, he has a net of -15 yards rushing on the season, meaning defenses basically don’t worry about him taking off for a big gain.
Even though these three factors favor Luck, I still think the debate is up in the air. But, it will be determined on the field Saturday at the Coliseum.
Coming off arguably his worst performance of the season, Barkley will have something to prove in front of the home fans.
Coming off the biggest win of his collegiate career, Luck will try to prove his program is ready to make the jump to the next level.
Who will be the better quarterback?
Sounds like a good homecoming game to me.
“Soft Hands” runs every other Thursday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Jon at jhaber@usc.edu.
Ontime, it’s the color Cardinal.  Not the bird.  And I think I like Stanford’s chances in this game.  We shall see.
GO CARDINAL!
The Ducks were very complimentary of the Card’s and their win and the Duck’s accomplished their #1 goal in the PAC 10, to beat USC and badly.
The Cards are looking to kick butt too, so now it’s time for the Trojans to man up and put a whupp’n on that bird.

Playing in its final tournament before a three-month break, the USC men’s golf team completed an up-and-down three days on Wednesday to tie for sixth at the Gifford Collegiate at the CordeValle resort in San Martin, Calif.
The Trojans started strong, with help from junior Daniel Park, sophomore Steve Lim and freshman Sam Smith, who all carded rounds of two-under par on the first day, boosting the Trojans all the way to fourth overall after the first day of action.

Smith and Lim both shot for an eagle during their respective rounds; Lim at the par five 15th hole and Smith at the par five sixth hole. Smith, who started on the back nine, used his eagle and another birdie to finish the back nine at three-under par, negating a one-over par start to his day.
The tournament featured two of the best programs in the nation — Oklahoma State and Stanford, good measuring sticks for an ambitious USC squad.
“We had one of the toughest schedules in the nation,” Lim said. “It shows us where we are and what we need to improve in order to win a championship next year.”
Lim, who struggled earlier in the season, has seen a marked improvement in many facets of his game.
“Driving has been the key. Right now I’m hitting much straighter and I have a lot more confidence in my game,” Lim said.
Lim’s recent success has also convinced USC coach Chris Zambri that Lim is someone he can trust. This was especially important during the Gifford, as the team was without its best player junior Matthew Giles, who was at a pro event in Australia.
“He’s someone we can really rely on this year,” Zambri said of Lim. “He’s just a great player all around, good ball striker, good chipper and good putter.”
After the Trojans finished day two with a combined two-over par, 362, they were looking to use the final round to make a move on the leaderboard and climb back towards the top, but different course conditions stymied any comeback attempt, as the Trojans carded another 362 on the final day, ending the tournament tied for sixth.
Lim struggled on the final day as well, but was able to finish tied for 13th after a round of 73. Lim had struggled early in the round, and was looking at a round of three-over par, but was able to salvage a top-15 finish by birdying two of his final three holes.
“It’s disappointing to finish how I did today, but there were tough conditions,” Lim said after the tournament.
The team now has a nearly three-month break during which to improve, and although the team is forbidden by NCAA rules to hold full team practice, the interim time is something Lim and the rest of the team hope to take full advantage of.
“We have to use this time wisely, we just have to follow coach Zambri’s direction and work wherever we are lacking,” Lim said.

Michael Cooper built his reputation as a defensive stopper — the type of player who shut down the other team’s top scorer night in and night out.
Larry Bird went so far as to call him the best defender he ever played against.
Changing of the guard · Senior guard Heather Oliver brings veteran leadership back to the Women of Troy. Oliver will have to step up her offensive production after Camille LeNoir and Nadia Parker graduated. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But for all the superlatives heaped upon him as a player, the most important one was winner. Cooper won five NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers and now brings his winning pedigree to a USC women’s basketball team that is on the cusp of success.
For the Women of Troy to reach their goal, Cooper said the team has to play at the same level of defense his Lakers did.
“That was always our battle cry or mission,” Cooper said. “Defense wins championships, offense wins you some games.”
Entering his first season as coach of the Women of Troy, Cooper inherits a talented but injury-prone squad that made a surprise run to the Pac-10 Championship last season. Two key performers from that team — high-scoring guard Camille LeNoir and center Nadia Parker — are gone, but the Women of Troy return three other players who earned All-Pac-10 honors last season.
Senior Heather Oliver and sophomores Briana Gilbreath and Ashley Corral spearhead the attack for USC. The trio accounted for almost 40 percent of the team’s offense last season and will need to take on even bigger roles to replace the void left by the departures of LeNoir and Parker.
Still, Cooper is counting on the entire team to contribute.
“This isn’t going to be a one-or-two player team,” he said. “Our success is going to be dictated by how we play as a team.”
Two other players who should play a significant role for the team are senior Hailey Dunham and junior Kari LaPlante.
“It’s a big year for us, trying to get to the tournament,” Dunham said. “We haven’t made it in about three years, so I’m hoping to do it in my last year.”
LaPlante might be the most important player on the team this season. Cooper said it will be important for the 6-foot-5 center to stay on the court and out of foul trouble for a USC team that is short on size.
“It’s going to be a mental challenge for me that I’m willing to take,” LaPlante said. “I’m up for it [and] ready to battle with those girls.”
Despite their issues, the Women of Troy have the pieces in place to make another run at the Pac-10 championship — provided they can stay healthy.
Injuries have plagued the team for several years now and have already factored into this season. Redshirt sophomore Stefanie Gilbreath and freshman Vicky Tagalicod both suffered torn ACLs this fall and will have to sit out the season. For Gilbreath, it will be the third consecutive season she has missed with a knee injury.
In Gilbreath and Tagalicod’s absence, USC will look for contributions from two players who have never suited up for the Women of Troy. Highly touted freshman Christina Marinacci comes to USC as one of the top recruits in the country and should help the team get past its injury woes.
“Marinacci is definitely going to be an important factor for us,” Cooper said.
Another former top recruit, redshirt junior Jackie Gemelos, should finally be healthy enough to deliver on the enormous promise she showed as a prep athlete. Gemelos arrived at USC four years ago as the top recruit in the country but has suffered four knee injuries in that time span. She should be ready for action sometime in January.
“Jackie’s a heck of a player,” Dunham said. “I remember playing pickup games with her a couple of summers ago before she got injured and she’s a great passer.”
If USC can overcome some of the challenges it will face this year, the team has a good chance at its first NCAA tournament berth since the 2005-2006 season.
The Women of Troy have already hurdled perhaps their biggest obstacle of the season — adjusting to a new coach and a new system.
“Usually teams kind of butt heads with a new coach, but we really bought in from the start and we’re ready to win some games,” Dunham said.
The team has devoted three quarters of its practice time this fall to shoring up the defense.
“Defense is something we struggled [with] last year,” LaPlante said. “We were at the bottom for giving up points.”
Expectations for the team this season are modest. The Women of Troy sit well outside the preseason polls, although they did receive a handful of votes in the AP poll.
“Obviously people are picking us nowhere near the top so we have nothing to lose,” Cooper said. “We’re just asking all the people to come out and be supportive of us and see a new product that is going to be out there.”
USC will get its first chance at a victory on Friday when it hosts No. 11 Xavier in the season opener for both teams. The Women of Troy also take on Fresno State this Sunday at the Galen Center.

Growing up with a younger sibling can be a blessing and a curse.
Always having someone to play with and talk to is great, but the concept of sharing rooms, toys, clothes and attention can be irritating. The frustration continues as the younger sibling tries to emulate the older one, following his or her every move and copying every hobby, every phrase, every thing.
Senior leader · Alli, the older Hillgren, has been a constant influence on the USC women’s volleyball team and on her younger sister’s life. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
There are always exceptions to this rule, however, and one of the biggest is the effervescent sister duo of senior Alli Hillgren and freshman Carolyn Hillgren, two of the USC women’s volleyball team’s defensive specialists.
Hailing from a sports-loving family in San Diego, the girls began their volleyball journeys at Rancho Santa Fe Elementary School, where a program called Breakfast Volleyball Club allowed them to get to school early and learn to play the game with their friends.
“We definitely agree that’s where we started to love the game,” Carolyn said. “We just showed up and had fun. We were learning the game without even knowing it.”
Maturing faster than most middle school athletes, Alli and Carolyn had to make the first difficult choice of their athletic careers early on — choosing between sports.
“We had to make a choice in middle school of whether we wanted to play soccer or volleyball,” Carolyn said. “It was weird having to make a decision about college play when we were so young.”
They both went to Francis Parker High School, a private school near Downtown San Diego, where they had the chance to play for a gold- and bronze-medal Olympian, Eric Sato. They were both recruited to USC in their junior years and continued the Trojan tradition in their family.
“We come from a huge USC-based family,” Alli said. “Fourteen of my relatives came to USC before Carolyn and [me], so we’re the 15th and 16th people in our family to be Trojans.”
With so much family bonding, it’s hard to believe that the Hillgren sisters ever compete with each other for much, but their positions on the court are certainly a place where the stakes are high.
Alli is this year’s libero for the Women of Troy, a back row position that specializes in defensive strategy and serve-receiving, and Carolyn, following her older sister’s lead, is looking at the prospect of one day becoming a libero.
“Alli’s been here four years and is our libero,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “She does a great job as libero and a great job as co-captain.”
With only one libero a season, it becomes a right of passage when the position is handed off after a senior leaves the team, and Carolyn, along with the rest of the defensive specialists on the team, is waiting for the chance to fill the role Alli will leave vacant after this year.
“[Carolyn and I] do compete for the same position,” Alli explained. “But we’re blessed because we’re only two and a half years apart, but we’re three grades different, so we’re not directly competing, which is nice because we’re sisters. We don’t want to bite each other’s heads off.”
Haley said Alli makes sure not to be an overbearing older sibling.

“Alli’s been really good to let Carolyn have her own personality. She’s not giving Carolyn extra support. She supports all the players on the team, and I think that’s how Carolyn would like it.”
Carolyn explains that although Alli is her sister, she does not receive special treatment.
“I don’t think I have a leg up of getting the position,” Carolyn said. “When she’s gone and the position is open, it is going to have to be earned and I’m going to have to fight for it, because there’s a lot of talented girls on the team.”
Although Carolyn’s journey at USC is just beginning, Alli’s is coming to an end, and this year is bringing uncertainty to the college senior. As a business major, Alli’s focus is split between real estate and volleyball, although she is unsure which is right for her just yet.
“There’s a lot of doors that are open, I just haven’t decided which one to walk through yet,” Alli said. “It depends where I’m at; it depends where my body is at, and it depends if I still have a need to play.”
Fall is a crazy time for the volleyball team, and with the traveling, studying and playing, it is hard to have a regular life. But Alli and Carolyn make do, focusing on the road ahead and the promise that spring will give them time to have a normal college experience.
“It’s hard for us to have a social life during the season,” Alli said. “You just set your priorities. We’re doing something to honor the school, but there are parts of our life that take a toll. But we’re lucky because we’re involved with Theta, so that gives us an opportunity to branch out.”
As the season comes to an end, the girls are looking forward to getting back to a slower schedule with more time to see friends, spend time with family in San Diego and ride their horses when they have a free weekend.
The Hillgrens seem more like friends than sisters, although Haley says they are known to jokingly poke fun at each other off the court.
Both girls are supportive of each other’s play and focused on improving their game together, while working on their individual goals simultaneously.
Carolyn has followed in the footsteps of her older sister, perhaps as an indication of how much she admires Alli, yet the two of them managed to find their calling for the sport while playing and learning together. Though Alli may have had to share her toys and her parent’s affection, you cannot trace a bit of tension with her sister.
It just shows what she has learned in her leadership role, and why Carolyn would want to follow.

Don Draper is the walking caricature of early 1960s America.
He drinks, smokes and covets any woman he sees — and that is all just part of his job.
As the central character on the television show Mad Men, Don (Jon Hamm) is as much an era-defining persona as he is a valediction of times on the verge of drastic change — change that no one could have seen coming.
Sterling Cooper · (from left) Vincent Kartheiser, Aaron Staton and Rich Sommer star as members of a New York City ad agency in the award-winning drama series Mad Men. The series ended its third season Sunday. - Photo courtesy of AMC
For three seasons, Mad Men has captivated critics and audiences with its daring recreation of a time in America’s history when everything seemed right. The white working man was an unstoppable force with two wars behind him, a wealthy country to do nothing but prosper in and a loving family always waiting for him at home.
The ’60s social norms have been the focal point of the series so far, but with the end of the third season Sunday, the lavish American Dream that Don has based his existence on is finally starting to come apart.
The beauty about a show like Mad Men is that the audience knows exactly what is going to happen as the 1960s progress, but all of the characters do not.
So for Don and his co-workers at the Sterling Cooper advertising agency, life is filled with endless cigarettes, booze and promiscuity without a single thought to the dire consequences that lie ahead.
At first, it was just the societal conventions of the time that stood out as red flags to an audience fully aware of the dangers of cigarettes, but now the show has enhanced the inevitable.
On the second to last episode of the third season, one of the first major attacks on the American Dream occurred when Don and company experienced the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy.
This heavy blow to perfection was felt by all of the characters and, thankfully, was handled with exceptional precision. Everyone knew this horrible day was coming, but creator Matthew Weiner made sure to recreate the event and showcase it with the same amount of grief and confusion that occurred in reality.
The event, along with the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald, was a timely shock for the cast of Mad Men, representing the grim and desperate acknowledgement of an altering shift in lifestyle that could not have exploded more gracefully.
The season’s end also saw a divorce, which only adds to what will come in season four.
Season four will take place in 1964, and the Civil Rights Act and ongoing escalation of the Vietnam War are just a few of the events waiting to redefine society for the characters of Mad Men. The assassination of JFK simply opened the floodgates, and life as Don knows it will never be the same.
But it is not as though Mad Men hasn’t prepared its audience for such a dramatic shift. The show has presented two characters, right from the beginning, that always emphasized the constantly evolving 1960s, whether it was blatant or not.
The first, of course, would be Don, but the other would be his female counterpart, Peggy Olson (Elizabeth Moss). The first female copywriter at Sterling Cooper with her own office who works right alongside the men happens to be just as troubled as Don.
She has had her own string of affairs, as well as an illegitimate child with one of her co-workers. She eventually gave up the child; Peggy puts her career first, not a man.
Although Peggy certainly exemplifies the growing advancement of women during the 1960s, it is Don that sets the defining tone.
Mad Men is incredibly sharp because it captures the decay of the 1950s postwar mentality through a character who literally incorporates every bit of drastic change in the acts in which he participate. Don is calm on the surface, but his perfect suits, whiskey and replenishing supply of Lucky Strike cigarettes will not help him fight what is coming.
But Don, like the era he so eloquently defines, is on the verge of a serious breakdown. His mysterious past, along with the endless extramarital affairs add up to the unhappiness plaguing the supposedly perfect male.
And with the departure of his wife Betty at the end of the third season, it is just a matter of time until Don, like his country, falls desperately apart and severely requires redefinition.
As an audience, we have watched Don prosper; as the show continues, we will witness his downward spiral into chaos — a spiral that has certainly begun.
The modern use of cell phone has now made cheating easier because the cheat can communicate with his or her lover anywhere and even anytime. It can be in the car, at the park, in the bathroom and even some unusual places. What is cheat cannot doctor are the incoming and outgoing calls on the cell phone bill. If you can lay your hands on this, then the puzzle is half solved.

Oh my God, where did this film go wrong?
British native Peter Rodger’s documentary was advertised as a valiant attempt to define God in such a way that would pervade religious barriers and promote peace. The actual product, however, is a sloppy, cliché film by a novice director.
Believe · In the documentary Oh My God, due out Nov. 13, director Peter Rodger travels the world for answers to the question, “Who is God?” - Photos courtesy of BK PR
Rodger and his two-man crew traveled to the United States, the United Kingdom, Africa, India, Australia, the Middle East and Far East Asia in search of the answers to one driving question: “What is God?”
This question ultimately led to other related inquiries: Did man create God or did God create man? Do Christians, Muslims and Jews share the same God? If God exists, why is there so much suffering?
Muslims, Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and atheists alike attempted to answer these queries in the movie. There was a large bias toward those who professed the belief that all three of the main monotheistic religions are really just using three different names for the same deity. There was also a listing about God being equivalent with abstract concepts, most commonly love.
It is worth noting that they chose to ask, “What is God?” as opposed to “Who is God?” to remain somewhat objective. But Rodger’s editing and framing are hardly impartial. Most of the interviewees Rodger showcased had similar positive, peaceful views. There were a handful of extremists, one or two from every camp.
Rodger often made these extremists appear uneducated or simply idiotic, and his blatant favoritisms were all too apparent.
For instance, Rodger asks a boy suffering from cancer what his greatest wish is. Instead of replying, “To get better,” the boy answers, “To stop all the wars and fighting in the world.” Rodger immediately cuts to a segment of pagan indigenous people suffocating a goat to be sacrificed for rain.
The favoritism he showed toward peaceful parties and the discrimination he showed against belligerent parties was not unwelcome, but it was not in congruence with the neutral stance he claimed to be taking. This was disappointing for the audience members expecting an honest — and proportional — account of other cultures’ views on God.
Oh My God begins with a stunning montage of beautiful scenes, many of which rival those on the show Planet Earth. But this goes on for upwards of five minutes, much too long by filmmaking standards.
This is not a nature special, this is a documentary. Supposedly, there were more than 200 hours of film to work with, which means there shouldn’t be any dead time or filler of any kind in the 93-minute finished product.
Rodger has previously worked in advertising, and it shows. Commercials treat the audience as a base, unintelligent body, and this notion permeates the film. In addition to using himself as an on-camera narrator (an obvious and overused fame-seeking technique), Rodger also overuses visuals. If an interviewee discussed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the next shot is of a pair of buildings that modeled the World Trade Center.
The most annoying similarity to advertisements, however, is the use of hokey, unrelated background music. He discusses the aborigines’ view of God over an obnoxious techno beat. His addition of an irrelevant soundtrack greatly diminishes the power of the dances and rituals he displays on screen, creating a heightened sense of disconfirmation for the audience.
Even the film’s big-name stars — Hugh Jackman, Seal, David Copperfield and Ringo Starr, among others — could not save the film’s intended message. All messages of peace and universality are lost in a void caused by elementary-level editing and a nonsensical soundtrack.
It is unfortunate that a film that had so much potential will not evolve into a success. Some might see Rodger’s efforts as heroic — perhaps even saintly. And granted, he did circle the globe in search of the answers to one of the ultimate questions. But all this proves is his desperation.
He must have anticipated his lack of filmmaking skill ahead of time, concluding that the only way his film might have even a slight chance of success was if it included a star-studded panel of interviewees addressing a controversial subject against a global backdrop.
But even a combination of these things could not save this film from becoming a biased, uninspiring and poorly complied flop.
Oh My God comes off merely as Rodger’s attempt to break into filmmaking, and that is all this entire documentary becomes — an attempt, albeit a failed one.
To call Oh My God anything else is blasphemy.

Chewy.
That’s the best word to describe traditional Japanese mochi, a treat derived from glutinous rice. Though most Benihana-eating, less educated folk know the treat as a round rice ball filled with ice cream or as a trendy pétite topping for frozen yogurt, mochi’s origins stem from customary offerings to the gods and are a fixture in Japanese New Year celebrations.
One of the legendary makers of these pillowy, sweet bean-filled wonders is in Los Angeles’s own Little Tokyo — bordered by Skid Row, Downtown and assorted freeways. Fugetsu-Do has been serving the city since 1903, with the same family behind its glass counters. The establishment has an air of old-fashioned sensibility, which can often be lost in the ever-continuing rush of a city’s redevelopment and changing demographics.
Upon entering the quaint shop, which features an exterior emblazoned with prominent Japanese characters and a frame of striped awning, one can’t help but feel like a child in a candy store. On the right, visitors can buy the Japanese sweets they may recognize from childhood lunches: oversized barrels of Meiji Yan Yan crackers, a dizzying assortment of Pocky Sticks and the crème de la crème, Hello Panda.
These flashily prepackaged treats, though thoroughly satisfying, are just the modern, mass-produced transformations of the sweets Fugetsu-Do seeks to share with Los Angeles.
But Fugetsu-Do still prides itself on its original products, the mochi: round cloud-like works of art that are the Asian pétits fours — tiny, plump edible sculptures in soft pastel colors.
From the ultra-sweet round Kiku with a decorative dot and white bean paste filling to the nutty, heather-green Uguisu with red bean filling, the different kinds of mochi seem too much for the feeble, pre-sugared mind to deal with.
Mochi can have green and pink and white stripes, or even a gelatin yellow strip on top that resembles a cross between the shrimp on shrimp sushi, or even have the ingredients reversed — deep maroon bean paste can coat a center ball of squishy, white rice cake.
Each little mochi creation looks like a soft, fat, tiny sea creature with an opaque cuticle covering. The charming colors, however, make them seem delightfully appealing and adorable, and when stuffed together in the stamped, white cardboard sampler box, the colors combined to make a “diabetic rainbow,” as observed by a fellow eater.
Each treat has its own merit, partly because it’s simply a dessert unknown to the Western palate and a perfectly pleasant way to get some grown-up cavities. But it can take some getting used to.
The confectionary’s crowning creation, however, is fittingly put above all the rest in its own Styrofoam and plastic containers, complete with a label featuring a hula-dancing peanut: the peanut butter mochi.
Though the treat resembles a putrid shade of Pepto-Bismol pink, the perfectly round mochi looks like a cross between an animal’s tongue and the concave structure of a red blood cell.
Biting into the mochi is like a strange, wonderful trip: Gummy, fruity rice cake gives way to a lovely, crunchy peanut butter core. The play between peanut bits, creamy peanut butter and viscous glutinous rice seems a strange syncretism between old and new.
Fugetsu-Do’s fragile balance of new, old and a little bit of both mirror what Little Tokyo is today — a cozy reminder of what was, a portrait of what is and a hesitant prediction of what may come.
Japanese immigrants aren’t new to Los Angeles, but they no longer are the largest or most influential minority group in the area.
Little Tokyo has not had the same growth as Koreatown in the past decade. Though the section of the city isn’t exactly dying, it’s quieter, shyer — maybe even a little less confident.
Though there are still plenty of Japanese establishments, the newest businesses reek of neoyuppie hunger: a trendy Mediterranean restaurant, Spitz; a chain of the popular frozen yogurt brand, Yogurtland; a resident-themed mall restaurant, Johnny Rocket’s; and a neon-heavy American Apparel store scream “gentrification!”
The neighborhood’s state, however, can be seen in one discrete Friday night encounter. During a casual dinner in Orochon Ramen, diners waited in anticipation for their oversized, steaming bowls of spicy broth and noodles.
Interrupting the comforting clamor of clicking chopsticks and slurping customers, a loud teenager strutted in, cowboy hat on his head and open Budweiser can in his hand, declaring that he was going for the “Extreme Orochon” challenge.
His gang of skinny jeans-wearing, ne’er-do-wells whooped in excitement as he tried to establish his manhood with a dangerously hot bowl of soup, a loaf of bread and some milk. Other diners rolled their eyes, recognizing the universal indicators of asinine behavior.
He didn’t make it, however, and his party got a stern scolding from the restaurant’s management.
Although one kid might have disrupted Little Tokyo for a short while, the neighborhood will need more than some chili paste to stop the young and obnoxious from upsetting the balance.

Director Adam Salky and screenwriter David Brind dared to be different in their first feature-length film, the appropriately titled Dare.
The two men, who met in Columbia University’s graduate film program, tell a story in the film that in theory is cliché — it centers around three teenagers during their last semester of high school — but in execution is both unique and unexpected.
Truth or dare · The indie drama Dare was originally a short film that collaborators Adam Salky and David Brind made while graduate film students at Columbia University.

A 2009 Sundance Film Festival selection, this indie drama is based on a short film of the same name, which Salky and Brind worked together on in 2004 to fulfill a first-year requirement at Columbia.
Although the short included a similar storyline and similar characters, its minimal length did not allow for the realistic complexity that the filmmakers wanted to include in a feature-length version.
“[The short] really left you with that feeling of what happens next,” Salky said. “Plus, our collaboration was so enjoyable that we decided to keep working together and turn it into a feature.”
Brind, who began writing the script for the feature-length version immediately after filming the short, said he knew he wanted to extend the film before anyone had seen it. It was his intrigue with the movie’s seemingly typical good girl, Alexa (Emmy Rossum), who was only a peripheral character in the short, that ultimately motivated him.
“We only see a small glimmer of her,” Brind said. “She’s an aspiring actress; she’s clearly a perfectionist. I really wanted to investigate her and see what was underneath all that, so that was my way into the feature.”
But recreating a short film as a feature comes with its challenges.
The short focused around what became a single scene in the feature film: an intimate encounter between the high school bad boy, Johnny (Zach Gilford), and Ben (Ashley Springer), the closeted gay student who constantly feels like an outsider. The challenge for Brind was making this scene, which already existed as a short, into something bigger — something different.
“How do I stay true to what was there, what people liked about it, while also fleshing it out, expanding it and telling the story I want to tell about high school kids playing with the archetypes we’ve seen before?” Brind said he asked himself while writing the script.
In order to achieve this transition into psychological complexity, Brind chose to split the feature film into three parts, each focusing on the film’s sequential events from a different main character’s perspective.
“We are fools if we think everyone perceives us exactly how we think of ourselves and so I really wanted to reflect that in this structure, where we could very personally get into each person’s heads for a period of time and then move on,” Brind said.
As the perspective changes with the progression of the film’s story line, the visuals also change. Salky explains that this is meant to depict the characters’ transition from stereotypical high school personas into adulthood, when they can be anyone they want.
“The way I chose to go about doing this was to have the film begin in a very bright, sort of cotton candy-colored high school world that might feel to some audience members like a high school movie that they’ve seen before,” Salky said. “As the movie goes on it gets darker and much more shadowed and much more realistic.”
According to the filmmakers, portraying the lives of high school seniors realistically was one of the most important goals of the film. From this dedication to a reality often masked in high school movies came a series of sex scenes that Salky worked hard to execute effectively in the film.
“One of the things David and I set out to do was to tell a story that had these first fumbling sexual experiences and that told it like it is,” Salky said. “People want to see these things realistically done and they don’t want to see them shied away from.”
Some of the characters are based on specific people from Brind’s life and both filmmakers have experienced many of the emotions that the characters are faced with in the film.  Their ability and desire to delve into the high school world in such a realistic way was only natural.
“Adolescence is such a passionate, informative time, and so to have an opportunity to tell a story as a first feature in that world is very lucky,” Salky said.
Although Salky put hours of work into the film every week for four years, he was never certain it was going to be made into a movie.
“Every day you get up with the belief that this is the story you need to tell and the voice that you want heard and you just believe that somehow that’s going to happen,” Salky said.
For Salky and Brind, it did happen — mainly because they took risks, which is precisely what the filmmakers want viewers to get out of Dare: the idea that we must do something we are afraid of in order to discover who we really are.

Why did the chicken cross the road?
Because he had the swine flu.
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
As much as he could before he caught the swine flu.
Where’s Waldo?
I don’t know, but there’s probably a rash of swine flu cases there.
Jokes aside, the H1N1 virus is everywhere.
Just as potent as it was earlier this year, the swine flu is rearing its ugly snout all across the world, with new cases of the illness emerging at an alarming rate. Currently, there are 6,508 confirmed swine-flu related deaths worldwide, with the number growing by the hundreds every week.
The startling facts of the disease have become common knowledge, as talk of the H1N1 virus has dominated news coverage for the better part of the year. The underlying message has been very clear: This is the common flu on steroids.
Aside from a gnarly and potentially fatal set of symptoms and complications, this strain of the flu virus is particularly dangerous because those who have the biggest risk of contracting the illness make up what has traditionally been the healthiest age demographic — young adults ranging in age from 18-29. In adding this group to the traditional list of highly susceptible groups, it’s not hard to see why there’s been such a widespread panic.
And yet, in spite of all of the literature available about the dangers of the disease, the general attitude of those in the “highest risk” category seems to be one of cautious indifference, with many giving H1N1 the same respect as the Y2K bug in the midst of one of the largest health scares in recent memory.
According to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 40 percent of young adults said that they would get the H1N1 vaccination.
It’s fitting that this particular strain of virus has also been labeled “novel influenza” by the CDC, as it seems to be treated more like a novelty than a life-threatening illness. If anything, the tense atmosphere that has been created by this panic has served as a goldmine for fair-weather students who can use the buzzwords “swine flu” and “flu-like symptoms” as convenient excuses to finagle a way out of classes.
Realistically, it seems logical to think that everyone would want to have protection against the swine flu. Given the grave circumstances, why wouldn’t people be jumping at the opportunity to shield themselves from a pandemic?
The problem, then, must lie elsewhere.
Could it be the limited supply of the vaccine? Perhaps the collective mindset is that of altruistic deference — an elaborate goodwill effort to give others the opportunity to receive the vaccine before oneself. But it’s both a doubtful and moot point, considering most students fall into one of the high-risk groups that are being given priority for these shots.
Additionally, based on the fervor shown when people have to fight to snatch up a finite number of tickets for major football away games, it seems curious that they would not be capable of showing the same effort for something with a much more pronounced benefit.
Maybe the long lines are scaring away potential vaccine recipients. The prospect of being forced to stand in a motionless queue is only as rewarding as the prize to be found at the end. Understandably, the H1N1 vaccine is slightly less appealing compared to say, Space Mountain at Disneyland.
But, the fact remains that many of the distribution sites for the vaccines are offering extremely affordable (if not free) prices. Given this, wouldn’t it be an auspicious time investment to stick around?
The majority of the concern then, seems to fall upon the vaccine itself.
Granted, there have been isolated cases of severe allergic reactions to the H1N1 vaccine. Naturally, word of these particular incidents travels much farther than that of all the successful vaccinations. But most of the hype surrounding the dangers of the vaccine is misinformed.
The actual vaccine itself is the same as the seasonal flu variety, just with a different strain. Thus, rather than having two radically different treatments, you have very similar models with a twist.
It’s not unlike the difference between Bud Light and Bud Light Lime — they’re essentially the same product: If you’re going to get drunk with one of them, you’re going to find a similar result in the other.
In the same vein, those who got sick from the H1N1 treatment would’ve most likely found themselves with a similar averse reaction to the garden-variety flu vaccine.
Ultimately, the decision to get vaccinated isn’t a personal one, especially in the context of a highly interactive community setting such as a college campus. By holding out on the swine flu vaccine, you run the risk of being that guy.
The one who gets everyone in his house sick, even if it’s unintentional. And the one who is stoic  enough to go class feeling under the weather, only to contaminate those within a one-seat radius, eventually leading to a snowball effect.
Slippery slope? Yes.
But wholly possible.
Out of consideration for others, it would be in the interest of all to try and get vaccinated.
With plenty of opportunities to receive vaccines at free clinics and physician’s offices, and a continued production of the vaccine, the only conceivable reason why someone would skip out on the vaccine is pure laziness.
Perhaps this is just a case of Darwinism waiting to run its course.
It would be in the best interest of all to reverse our pigheaded ways before we find out.

I think that the swine flu is a serious thing becuase it is a flu, but in a way people exagerate to make it bigger that what it is. It is bad but they make it seem bigger. I myself take really good of myself to prevent myself from getting it, I use sanitizer for my hands and i also wash my hands to prevent from getting any germs.
“Since this is an opinion article, I think the swine flu is way over rated.” –  Oh, really.  Maybe you should look up the 1918 Spanish Flu on Wikipedia.  While you are at it, look up cytokine storm, and perhaps you’ll appreciate why the young and the healthy are at particular risk from a novel influenza virus.
“People made it into some huge pandemic when all it is is a flu.” – Have you ever had influenza, not just what your mother tells you is a flu?  I have.  Try a 103 degree fever, chills, coughing up blood after a week, and not being “right” for a couple of months afterward.  That’s influenza – it ain’t a runny nose and a sore throat.
‘”Speaking of the flu, the flu kills thousands of people every year yet people don’t freak out about that.” – People should.  Influenza kills a lot more people that a many other diseases that get a lot more money thrown at them by the government and private industry.  If a fraction of the money spent on the more “glamorous” diseases was spent on influenza, we’d have a universal vaccine (that is, one against all flu strains) that wasn’t made in chicken eggs (the cause for many of the allergic reactions, and a huge supply chain issue).
” It is just a new kind of flu introduced to the world; it does not need to be looked any differently than the common cold.” –  See the comments above; flu is NOT the common cold.  It can kill you, it can kill your grandmother, it can kill your nieces and nephews.
Get vaccinated, if not for you, for those around you.
Thanks for pointing this out, Yoon. I have been asking for what seems to be an eternity to my mother, “When are we going to get our vaccine?”. She always says “When the lines aren’t so big” or “When the clinics are set up”. That is when I am forced to go against my own set of values and beliefs and obey her. She just does not have the same mentality that many others, including me, have when it comes to getting vaccinated. We do not want another Spanish Flu catastrophy like we witnessed in the early 1900’s. Tens of thousands died because of that breakout. But, we did not have the technology that we have today. We now have vaccines, vaccines that cost millions of dollars to purchase and make. Vaccines that millions of Americans requested, but now that we have them, we decide not to consume them. What is it America? Is laziness yet another one of your “famous” traits. I think that we as a nation need to get vaccinated and set an example to the rest of the world that we can stop this nasty flu.
Since this is an opinion article, I think the swine flu is way over rated. People made it into some huge pandemic when all it is is a flu. Speaking of the flu, the flu kills thousands of people every year yet people don’t freak out about that. It is just a new kind of flu introduced to the world; it does not need to be looked any differently than the common cold.
                            – Bo Curbow
Beg to differ, I think that you are completely wrong. We are taking very asseverate precautions to prevent more people dying around the world. True, flu does kill thousands during this time of the year, but this new flu does not have a season. This flu will stay with us until we have taken the needed measures to contain it.

In just two weeks, a long-anticipated day will finally be here. It is one of the most important days of the year — one many Americans prepare for with great urgency and excitement. It is the day that shows us what it means to be a proud citizen of this country, the day we remember what matters most: Black Friday.
Black Friday is a day when Americans embrace the commercial chaos of Christmas time after stuffing themselves full of turkey, pie and a plethora of other wildly unhealthy foods. It is the culmination of a holiday of gluttony.
I look forward to Black Friday every year. My best friend and I always wake up at 3 a.m. and park ourselves in the mile-long line outside of Wal-Mart, shivering and yawning in the cold night air, waiting for the blessed hour of 5 a.m. to arrive so that we can shove and fight our way to the unbelievably low-priced merchandise.
Last year, I sprinted across the store and snagged the last KitchenAid mixer on sale for $100 less than usual. I injured my ankle in the process, but it did not matter. I was ecstatic.
Those who look upon the commercial greed that surrounds Black Friday with disdain simply do not understand the joy of passing out at 10 a.m. surrounded by plastic bags, knowing that not only have you succeeded in completing your Christmas shopping for the year, but that you have done it at a considerably lower cost than anyone who goes to the store on a regular day. Critics view Black Friday devotees as completely delirious. And, to be honest, they have a point.
Last year, Wal-Mart experienced a horrifying tragedy when crazed shoppers in Valley Stream, NY trampled to death an employee — a 34-year-old man named Jdimytai Damour. The news struck the nation: It was a ghastly example of just how vicious and thoughtless human beings can be when placed in unnatural circumstances fueled by greed and selfishness.
Damour’s death was a wake-up call for the various big-chain businesses that take advantage of Black Friday with line-forming sales, and they are taking action to prevent any similar tragedies in the future.
This year, Wal-Mart is implementing new crowd control procedures designed by experts who manage the Super Bowl and the Olympics.
Each individual store will have its own customized plan to facilitate the way customers wait, enter, shop and exit. Instead of letting in the first shoppers in the early morning, most Wal-Marts will open Thursday morning and stay open straight through Friday evening. This will prevent mile-long lines from forming on the sidewalk outside, which make shoppers restless and uncomfortable.
For specific hot-ticket items, customers will be able to enter the store at any time and line up at those particular merchandise displays.
The products will still go on sale on Friday at 5 a.m., but workers supervising the lines will hand out the goods to the customers in the order in which they joined the line until they run out of stock.
Will the changes really do any good? It would be wonderful to think so, but let’s be honest: People are scary. Just as I have sprinted across aisles full of goods to buy some material item I could easily go without, countless others have been infected with Black Friday delirium.
While the new system will control the dangerous mad dash attack through the store caused by the former flooding-of-the-gates technique, it threatens to create an entirely new form of chaos. The stakes of the competition have just been raised.
Now, instead of lining up outside of the store the night before, the most manic shoppers will be walking into Wal-Mart to camp out at 6 a.m. on Thursday. It is likely that anyone delirious enough to think they stand a chance of buying a $300 big-screen TV if they enter the store on Friday is going to be severely disappointed — and angry.
Basically, if anyone wants in on Wal-Mart’s unbeatable prices, they better be willing to sacrifice their Thanksgiving, which is just not fair.
Other major big-box stores, such as Best Buy and Toys-R-Us, who have not yet experienced any major problems, are going about business as usual, but tensions are high this year. The country is slowly making its way out of a recession, but people are still going to do whatever it takes to save some money.
Black Friday is a time-honored retail tradition. But its existence may soon need to come to an end. No matter how great it may be for our struggling economy, if the madness continues to escalate, more people are going to get hurt.
No $5 toaster oven is worth endangering a fellow human being. Yes, I will be roaming the strip malls in the early Friday morning darkness scouring the town for deals — and I encourage you all to do the same. Let’s just hope the new security measures successfully tame the madness that threatens to rise among the masses.

Winston Churchill once famously called democracy “the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”
The predicament of age restrictions within the judicial system present similar difficulties.
Nearly all USC students have to deal with age restrictions. You have to be 18 to vote. Twenty-one to drink. Twenty-five to rent a car. Sixty-two to receive social security benefits — and so on.
These rules are all confusing and often frustrating. Who is to say that a 20-year-old is not responsible enough to drink, but a 21-year-old is? Nothing magical happens to people when their age changes, but the laws governing their behavior do. Is there anything that can be done about this dilemma?
This question is particularly relevant now because of two cases currently under consideration in the US Supreme Court. Lawyers for prisoners Joe Sullivan and Terrance Graham are arguing that their clients were too young at the time of their crimes to warrant the life sentences they are currently serving.
Sullivan was given life without parole for raping a 72-year-old woman when he was 13. Graham was given life for armed burglary at 16 followed by a probation violation at 17. Each lawyer is arguing that the logic behind restricting capital punishment to offenders 18 and older should be applied to their clients, which the court did in 2005 in Roper v. Simmons, and to only people who committed murder, which the court did last year in Kennedy v. Louisiana.
Exactly how the cases will be resolved is unclear, but the court seems to be leaning toward considering the age of young offenders when a life sentence is a possibility. However, the justices are still in disagreement about whether drawing a specific line makes sense, or if the current case-by-case system should remain in place.
The justices need to draw a line.
The problem with a line is that it is inevitably arbitrary — there is not one age at which point life sentences begin to seem reasonable (though if there were, it would definitely be older than 13). A case-by-case system is able to surmount this subjectivity by allowing all of the details of a case to dictate whether a juvenile receives a life sentence.
Such a system, however, is open to abuse or judicial mistakes, which our justice system is predicated on guarding against. In fact, one could argue that the foundational principle of our courts is to avoid punishing individuals who do not deserve it.
There are currently nine people serving life in prison without parole for crimes that they committed as 13-year-olds, and two of them did not commit murder. These people had their entire lives taken from them because of something they did at an age when nobody can be expected to answer for their actions to such an extent. We need a specific rule to guard against this.
The reality is that years of experience with all sorts of questions, from who should be allowed to drive to who should be allowed to be executed, has shown that age limits are the least  of bad options because they prevent extreme or chaotic circumstances. This is especially true in questions of protecting people from the law, a core American tenet.
Setting the age is hard. Truthfully, I have no idea what the age should be, though 18 seems to make the most sense as that is the age that the government has apparently decided that people are mature enough to be sentenced to death, vote, serve in the military and so on.
Whatever age is chosen is bound to be arbitrary. Choosing one would be the worst option — besides for all the other ones that have been tried from time to time.
Daniel Charnoff is a junior majoring international relations (global business).
I was understanding your point until the part “These people had their entire lives taken from them because of something they did at an age when nobody can be expected to answer for their actions to such an extent.”
What?? They are 13, not 3! At age 13, you should know right from wrong! (If they don’t well, that’s a totally different problem)  13 year olds are in 7th, 8th, or 9th grade. They know better, and need to take responsibility for their actions. They are growing up, they are teenagers, and they should held accountable for all that they do. Yes, parents are more involved in taking some responsibility also, but it is still mostly on the 13 year old. A 13 year old is no less responsible for a crime than a 23 year old is. You do the crime, you do the time. That’s my philosophy.  I agree that you said that the “age line will be arbitrary”, but being a teenager doesn’t give anyone a free pass from the consequences. Not at all.

Students may have to adjust their spending habits because of a temporary, 10 percent income tax increase of 10 percent that is designed to relieve California budget constraints.
The new income tax, which began Nov. 1, increases the amount withheld from paychecks by 10 percent, according to the California Franchise Tax Board.
The amount withheld varies by tax bracket — for example, if a worker is taxed 20 percent, the worker will now be taxed 22 percent.
For many students who work part-time jobs, the increase is small, but still noticeable.
“Mentally, I tell myself I can’t buy as much,” said Justin Ng, a sophomore majoring in communications. “I work 10 hours a week … primarily for everyday living.”
The state intends to return the money when taxpayers file their returns in April.
First of all, the top tax bracket in California is 9.3%, so your example of 20% becoming 22% percent is misplaced. It’s more like 0.93% increase (worst case scenario) in withholding.  That’s less than one percent, or $9.30 for every $1,000 you earn. If taking home $9.30 less dollars mean you have to tell yourself to cut back on your spending, then you’re probably spending too much money as it is.

The countless emails students receive from various echelons of USC administration can be grating. Surely it isn’t necessary to have separate email accounts for “USC Athletics,” “USC Football” and “VictoryEmail?” And if it is, shouldn’t there also be “Defeat Email” for when we lose to University of Oregon?
For those ambitious enough to actually open the emails, the reward is seldom worth the effort.
At Cornell though, a screw up by some lowly staff members made the campus wide email system exponentially more interesting than it had ever been.
By accident, two business school employees managed to CC the entire campus on their very private and very descriptive sex emails.
Tamer highlights include:
“I can practically FEEL your torturous little fingernails flitting across my stomach, and they’re making me ACHE with the desire for RELEASE!!! :)”
The smiley emoticon really brings home the desire here.
Who knows, maybe the next Visions & Voices email will be more descriptive about coming events…if you get my drift.

As the nation honors all of its veterans Wednesday, USC will honor the veterans here on campus as a handful of organizations host receptions recognizing their service.
According to USC’s Office of Veteran Affairs, there are currently 218 student veterans attending USC, whose work will be appreciated at the day’s events.
“Everyone should at least remember in their own way that there are people who sacrifice a lot so that we can all be safe and free at home,” Scott Lowe, the vice president of the USC Veterans Association and a student veteran himself, wrote in an email. Lowe served in Iraq from 2003 to 2004 and 2005 to 2006 as an infantry sergeant in the 101st airborne division.
Lowe said students should take the time to understand and appreciate the efforts of student veterans who are looked down on and misunderstood.
“There is a stereotype that we aren’t that bright, and that we had no other options other than to join the military,” Lowe wrote. “While there are some who fit the stereotype, most of us are not like that at all, and especially not those of us who made it into schools like USC.”
Students will have the chance to honor their fellow students who have served at a variety of events Wednesday.
Hosted by the USC Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy and USG, the second annual Veterans Day Appreciation Reception will take place from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the USC University Club.
Student veterans will also be able to receive information on the services and programs available to them at the Veterans Day Recognition Bonanza, to be held at the northeast corner of McCarthy Quad between 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.
Visitors at the event will have the chance to view military equipment, gear, weapons and two humvees.
But Lowe said students don’t need to attend the events to honor veterans.
“One really easy, yet meaningful, way to do that would be to simply say, ‘Thank you’ to a veteran,” he wrote. “After the military, veterans move on with their lives, but it’s nice to know that what we’ve done is appreciated by those who we protect.”
In addition to the events being held in their honor, the Office of Veterans Affairs helps student veterans by ensuring their current enrollment is verified to the Veterans Association, so they can be paid through the GI Bill.
“We are the liaison between the students and the VA regional office,” said Quence Smith, grading and veterans affairs coordinator for USC’s Office of Veteran Affairs. “We interact with the veterans here on campus and interact with the rest of the world that may be interested in attending USC.”
The post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational benefits to veterans who return to school after serving in the military.
“The fact that I was able to serve my country, and then come to a great school like this really says great things about the opportunities available to all of us,” Lowe wrote.

Despite a small dip in October sales for the USC Pertusati Bookstore, officials said the store’s retail sales show signs of recovery, consistent with the nationwide trend.
According to Thomson Reuters’ tally of 30 major chain stores, national retail sales for October rose 1.8 percent compared to last October. Though inventory numbers have not yet been finalized, Daniel Archer, director of the Pertusati University Bookstore, said sales in the month were down about 0.7 percent — $250,000 less than the $3.7 million earned last October.
Book Drop · The USC Pertusati Bookstore recorded a 0.7 percent drop in October sales, but officials are optimistic sales will increase over the course of the coming months. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
Archer said the relatively small size of the dip is significant. Officials were prepared for worse, he said, particularly considering USC played less home football games this semester.
“The fact that we had these numbers even though we had more football games last year actually makes it a victory,” Archer said.
Archer added he was confident the sales would increase by the USC’s final home game against Arizona on Dec. 5. Last year, the bookstore made $3.3 million in sales in November and $3.9 million in December, Archer said. This year, the bookstore is hoping to at least match last years’ numbers.
“Flat is the new ‘up’ in retail,” Archer said.
Home games tend to be more lucrative for the bookstore, Archer said, generating an average of $600,000 in sales during the week as opposed to about $200,000 for away games or bye weeks.
Alumni and fan purchases account for most of those sales, he said, so the bookstore focuses on selling merchandise such as USC gifts and clothing.
“The Trojan brand right now is one of the hottest in the country,” Archer said. “The Pete Carroll era has been a big piece of why the brand’s popularity has grown. In the end, it’s all driven by Trojan fanatics.”
The sales can also be affected by the success of the football team, according to Lars Perner, assistant professor of clinical marketing at USC.
“Clearly the better the team is doing the better sales will be,” Perner said. “It’s  a very critical situation. The more we win and the more national media coverage we get, the more demand there is.”
Though USC has lost two games this year, Archer said the three upcoming home games will generate substantial revenue for the bookstore.
Although retail sales declined only slightly, textbook sales took a larger hit.
“There’s something I refer to as ‘the textbook crisis in America,’” Archer said. “Prices have gotten to the point where students are looking at foregoing buying textbooks.”
Textbook sales, which are strongest at the beginning of each semester, were down about 14 percent compared to 2008, while other book sales were down about 8 percent, according to Raymond McDermott, the manager of course materials for USC Bookstores. Used textbook sales remained about the same.
For the last couple of years, textbook sales have leveled off as more students turn to alternative sources for textbooks, McDermott said. But, he added, the state of the economy last year contributed to a more significant drop than usual.
But finally, sales are beginning to improve, he said.
“It’s only now that most retails are starting to see any kind of pickup,” McDermott said. “The holidays might not be as good as previous years. Even though the recession has ended, the job situation is still horrendous and people aren’t spending on books because of it.”
According to Archer, the book sales and retail sales are independent of each other. Although there are spikes in textbook sales at the beginning of each semester and in general merchandise sales before football games, the bookstore’s computer sales remain more or less constant throughout the year.
This year, the bookstore is hoping to at least match last years’ numbers. “Flat is the new ‘up’ in retail,” Archer said.

On Thursday, USC will host its first Critical Issues Forum designed to give experts a chance to discuss important situations facing society, starting with financial problems in the state government.
The forum, “Going For Broke: Governance and the Fiscal Crisis,” will include six guest speakers who will discuss the state’s current economic status.
David Galaviz, executive director of Local Government Relations, said the forum, which was organized through the School of Policy, Planning and Development, will benefit USC’s relationship with community and government officials.
“The Critical Issues Forum is part of an overall strategy to improve the connections that the university has with policymakers,” Galaviz said.
He said PPD is hoping to work with policymakers to help confront challenges facing society.
Los Angeles Councilmember Bernard Parks, who will also speak at the event, said the forum is a good chance for students to learn about the financial situation.
“Even if it doesn’t fit into their major or is not something they’re studying, it’s how this state and city are going to conduct themselves in this crisis, what the government is currently doing and how they’re conducting themselves in those efforts,” he said.
Dowell Myers, a professor who will speak at the forum, said this forum will be part of a continuing attempt to help effect change.
“It’s an example of USC taking leadership in the state,” Myers said.
Galaviz said they expect about 200 people to attend the first forum.
The six-member committee includes Los Angeles County Chief Executive Officer William T. Fujioka; California State Controller John Chiang; Parks; and Fiscal Policy Advisor for California Forward Fred Silva.
It will also feature two USC professors: Myers, the director of the USC Population Dynamics Research Group; and Bedrosian Center Director Daniel Mazmanian.
“We feel that experience of the six panelists can really create a strong learning experience and can get students thinking about how to solve these pressing public policy issues,” Galaviz said.
Myers said he believes the forum is a step toward finding a solution.
“You need to have lots of dialogue,” he said. “There’s a lot of ideas being put on the table.”
These forums will be a semiannual event, Galaviz said.
Preliminary ideas for future forums include the film industry, homelessness and health care.

Can I admit something?
The warmth of California sometimes frustrates me. It is just so undeniably constant. So predictable.
I know when I wake up in the morning what I will need for the day — every day. There is always sun, a slightly smoggy sky and chilly, empty nights. But most of all, there is monotony, repetition and uniformity.
I can give you so many synonyms underlying this exaggerated bitterness. At the bottom of it, I will concede that all of my complaints are inspired by one very simple sensation: nostalgia.
In the magical wonderland known as the Midwest, seasons are defined by something a bit unfamiliar to California: seasonal change. And all of these changes, these brief flurries of vicissitudes and uncertainty, are always welcomed. These shifts are natural, graceful and yet, despite their fluid and imminent nature, always surprising.
More than a week ago, one particular change was heavy in the air — a change as inevitable as the shifting seasons of the Midwest.
After 19 years as president of USC, President Steven B. Sample announced his resignation.
I firmly believe that Sample is the person who has radically changed the character of USC, and he was pivotal in the transformation of the student body, community outreach programs and academic priorities of this campus. Without him, USC would not be the institution that it is today.
But in remembering all of his numerous triumphs, it would be a bit blind and foolish of us to completely dismiss the few flaws and mistakes — like the displacement of the surrounding community — that are just as present and tangible in his legacy.
It is incredibly easy to only remember the immaculate faces of the things we love. So many facets of our childhood, for instance, are intensely glorified. My insistence on changing seasons is one of them.
For nearly three years, I have hated on California’s sun. I laughed when it drizzled and class attendance fell 80 percent and I scoffed when students wearing Uggs walked about campus in 65-degree heat.
I pitied all the native Californians who would never understand the sensation of making the first footprints on newly fallen snow or the sting of a snowball on your left cheek. Of spending an hour making the largest leaf pile possible only to climb on a ladder and jump — destroying all your hard work with one triumphant leap.
When I think of autumn and winter, I remember only the soothing, epic moments from my childhood. When I think of autumn, I think of vivacity — the satisfying crunch of every step, the new, vibrant hues of red and orange and gold that come to life with every blink.
And when I think about winter, I think of magic.
Winter is that sharp tang of a crisp, raw morning. It’s feeling the snow clinging to the back of your neck after your first snow angel.  It’s the icicles falling from bare, extended arms like crystalline bangles, swaying to an unmoving wind.
It’s whispering a familiar tune with ol’ Bing smiling somewhere next to you, the settling snow and drifting zephyrs caressing our rosying cheeks. It’s seeing a pure, white blanket of untouched perfection lying snug on every inch of the horizon and thinking, “Hello, old friend.”
What I often forget to consider are the inches of dirty, blackened snow and the heightened smell of waste in the air from trash solidifying in the streets. I forgot about the layer of ice underneath tantalizing white mounds of fresh snow that caused more than a dozen bruises on my anxious body. I forgot that instead of marching footprints into the freshly fallen slush or building snowmen with my little sister, I was often scraping ice off of what suddenly seemed to be an endless driveway.
It’s certainly reassuring and comforting to remember only the glorious moments of anything coming to an end.
Stuck in this Californian wasteland, I tell anyone I can only have the most beautiful memories about exhilarating leaps into leaf piles and the glistening beauty of falling snow. That icy driveway is, however, just as relevant as snow angels and neighborhood-wide snowball fights.
Sample had undeniable blemishes in his legacy that, far from being moments of condemnation, should nevertheless be reflected upon. Yes, I agree — Sample was a legend, a visionary and quite possibly our most influential president; but like the two-faced coin of winter, his presidency was not perfect. Changes — some that now require implementation because of Sample’s choices and actions — are still waiting to be made.

Stay with me now.
In general, USC fans don’t like UCLA fans, and UCLA fans don’t like USC fans.
Right? That much we know for sure.
But why?
Well, that’s another question.
Trojans or Bruins often press for an answer when you ask them why they don’t like each other.
And unlike some may tell you, neither of the schools suck.
In fact, they’re both great.
Great academically, great athletically and great in just about every other manner you can judge them in.
But we still don’t really like each other.
“It’s just the nature of the two institutions,” said USC women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin. “We’re at different ends of the spectrum on pretty much everything, and we don’t really see eye to eye on anything. But I think it is a good, healthy rivalry and it’s one that creates a lot of excitement within Southern California in every single sport.”
And that comes from a coach whose Women of Troy have lost their last three matches against the Bruins.
But how are we going to settle this rivalry now — now that the primary measure of athletic competition between the two schools, the oh-so-popular Lexus Gauntlet, doesn’t exist anymore?
You’ve probably heard about the Gauntlet. It gave almost equal value to each of the 18 sports in which the two schools compete against each other, added all the results up and essentially measured which school was superior athletically in a given year.
The trophy was more than a bit showy, a silver spectacle meant to symbolize a knight’s dropped gauntlet from “years ago.” Engraved on it was the line: “If a rival picked it up, the two would fight to the death.”
They didn’t exactly do that, but the Gauntlet definitely increased the competitiveness of the rivalry.
USC won it the last two years, clinching it in dramatic fashion last year in the middle of the annual track and field dual meet with the Bruins.
Jose Eskenazi, USC associate athletic director for marketing, said that was a perfect example of how the Gauntlet allowed the intensity between the two schools to spread from the main revenue sports all the way through each athletic department.
“The original concept was to create a cross-town competition focusing on football primarily,” Eskenazi said. “And then the idea sort of flourished into something that would last, and it made perfect sense — especially with both athletic traditions being so deep in many sports — to do it across the board.”
Tom Davis, assistant vice president and general manager of ISP Sports, the company that operates UCLA’s marketing department, shares the same sentiment.
“It was great that as a team member — whether you were a member of soccer or football — that your contribution to your team also has implications to the whole USC-UCLA rivalry,” Davis said. “But I don’t think any of the UCLA student-athletes need an added incentive to want to beat USC and vice versa, I’m sure.”
But Lexus’ contract for the Gauntlet ended in June, as the luxury car company couldn’t afford to continue to sponsor the rivalry in the stalled economy.
Since then, the two schools have continued to keep a private tally, but the number isn’t available to the general public and the old Gauntlet website that displayed an updated score has gone offline.
The goal is to provide a new, up-to-date resource within the next two weeks, officials from both USC and UCLA said — with or without a corporate sponsor to foot some of the bill.
Until then, they realize the effects a Gauntlet-less rivalry may have.
“I could see how it could affect their enthusiasm. Absolutely,” Eskenazi said. “Just because the awareness isn’t there. But once it gets up and running again, it’s our job to make that happen ourselves.”
Davis is working in tandem with Eskenazi to create whatever that may be.
“I don’t think [not having the Lexus name] diminishes the rivalry,” Davis said. “It existed long before the Lexus Gauntlet did, although I certainly think the gauntlet added an interesting dimension to it.”
And they also realize what it can mean school-wide.
Marc Dellins, UCLA’s associate athletic director and sports information director, said that those keeping their eye on the Gauntlet were more than just players and fans.
“All the coaches from both schools like keeping track of the head-to-head competition on the field and having something at the end of the year that symbolizes one school beating the other school,” Dellins said. “More often than not, I think that’s something that the coaches enjoy.”
Yep. Just ask Khosroshahin.
“It definitely brings a little something extra to the rivalry,” he said.

To the contrary, Orenthal. Most highlight videos produced by USC and the NCAA include his footage. (One of first “Bleacher Reports” sent to season ticket holders this yeard did.) Any reputable organization would include it. What you think of him personally, has nothing to do with his accomplishments on the field. It’s AMAZING he accomplished what he did, as a JUCO transfer and only 2 years of eligibility at USC!!!
I’m glad the Gauntlet is gone. I wish USC had ended their relationship with Lexus a long time ago.
On the Gauntlet website, there was a link to all “Famous USC alumni”. All of our Heisman winners were there, but one.
So, tell me. If I take my Lexus to be serviced and the mechanic has an issue with the Catholic Church, is he not going to perform the service the same way he would if I weren’t Catholic? (I hang a rosary from my rear view mirrors.)
That’s the same thing they’ were doing on their website…imposing their set of values as to who is worthy of being on a list of famous Trojans. Completely unacceptable! Like him or not, he was a Trojan and always will be. Just as a sibling or child who’s messed up in life, they’re still family. If you turn your back on him, you shouldn’t call yourself a Trojan.
I know.  I’m not in a lot of the highlight videos, either.

A poor finish on the second day has the No. 12 USC men’s golf team sitting in eighth place at the Gifford Collegiate Championship in San Martin, Calif.
The Trojans are at 5-under par for the tournament, 11 strokes behind No. 2 Stanford.
USC entered day two of competition in fourth place and rose to as high as second before coming unglued down the stretch. The Trojans registered four double bogeys and a pair of triple bogeys on the back nine and saw their score for the day swell from 6-under par to 2-over.
Stanford parlayed a strong second round into a lead entering the final day. The Cardinal shot 10-under par on Tuesday and hold a one-stroke advantage over No. 1 Oklahoma State and No. 36 Duke.
Sophomore Steve Lim shot 3-under on Tuesday and moved into a tie for seventh place on the individual leaderboard. Junior Daniel Park and freshmen Sam Smith and Martin Trainer are tied for 37th at 1-over par.
One thing that has tested the depth of the Trojans is the unusual scoring format the tournament employs. Six players compete for each school with the five low scores for each round counting, a departure from the typical format of five players and four scores counting.
The format has been particularly difficult for the team to adjust to with the absence of returning All-American junior Matthew Giles, who is taking part in a tournament in Australia.
Freshman T.J. Vogel and junior Bo DeHuff are tied for 43rd and 52nd, respectively.

The Trojans have three games left in the 2009 season, but quarterback Matt Barkley is already being asked to evaluate his performance.
Such is life when you’re a 19-year-old true freshman starting at a top-10 program.
Under the microscope · Matt Barkley has had his ups and downs this year. He is looking to bounce back after a subpar game last weekend. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
“I think I’ve done alright,” Barkley said after practice Tuesday. “I didn’t really know how it would pan out. Coming into the season, I was just going to take it one game at a time, but I’m pretty happy with how we played and happy that we’re winning.”
USC is winning, in the literal sense of the word.
The Trojans are 7-2 after squeaking by Arizona State on Saturday, but Barkley’s dealing with pressure yet unseen this season after completing just 7-of-22 attempts against the Sun Devils.
“I’ve corrected things mentally and physically in my game, going over film with Coach [Jeremy] Bates and stuff,” Barkley said. “But we’re confident this week that we’re gonna have a complete game and finish strong.”
Things did appear different on Tuesday.
On the final play of the first-team scrimmage on Tuesday, with the score tied 7-7 and bragging rights on the line, Barkley rolled out left to avoid a rush and delivered an across-the-body strike to redshirt sophomore tight end Rhett Ellison.
“I’m not trying to make up for yards that I could have had or anything like that,” Barkley said. “That’s not how we play and that’s not how I want to play.”
u
Barkley will be getting back some of his offensive weapons against Stanford, as both senior tight end Anthony McCoy and redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili are on track to start against the Cardinal.
Havili has missed the last three games after suffering a separated shoulder in the Notre Dame game, while McCoy missed the last two contests with a sprained ankle.
“It’s huge,” Barkley said. “To have their leadership and their experience I think really helps. Just their presence on the field is huge.”
But redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams is still day-to-day with a sprained ankle suffered in the Arizona State game.
Carroll said Williams’ status would be determined later this week.
u
Stanford senior running back Toby Gerhart, a 6-foot-1, 235-pound bruiser, is gathering a lot of attention from the Trojans this week.
Gerhart has averaged 135 rushing yards and nearly two touchdowns per game this season while putting together an unlikely Heisman campaign.
Last week, he consistently burned Oregon on a career-high 38 carries, rushing for 223 yards and three touchdowns and losing yardage on only one carry.
USC will likely put eight in the box for at least some of the game against the Cardinal, meaning senior safety Will Harris would essentially play the role of a fourth linebacker in attempting to stop Gerhart.
“He’s a physical presence,” Harris said. “I’ve just gotta man up and basically just make my tackles and wrap up — bring the heart.”
Carroll compared Gerhart’s running style to that NFL great Jerome Bettis at his press conference.
“It’s that kind of style draws your focus because of the way he runs and the things that happens when he runs — knocking piles forward, and running over guys and all the cool things that he can do,” Carroll said.
18-year-old freshman fullback Simione Vehikite, all 6-feet and 245 pounds of him, played the role of Gerhart in scout team play on Tuesday. Carroll said Vehikite did a solid job emulating the ruggedness of Gerhart, but pointed out that few possess Gerhart’s same combination of size and speed that has terrorized Pac-10 teams this season.
