Following students’ return from Thanksgiving break, early testing numbers indicate growing levels of coronavirus breakthrough cases within the community, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Tuesday. Thousands of students tested within the past two days, resulting in 32 positive cases and a positivity rate of approximately 0.4%.  
The coronavirus testing appointment on MySHR portal crashed after students returned from holiday travels. USC requires students to receive weekly testing if fully vaccinated and every 72 hours if unvaccinated.
“We had about 20,000 to 30,000 people trying to log on within the same couple of hours to schedule their tests,” Van Orman said. “Unfortunately, our servers couldn’t handle it.” 
In a communitywide email Tuesday, USC Student Health encouraged students, faculty and staff to drop off coronavirus saliva samples at campus testing sites to meet their weekly requirements. USC Care Crew workers were instructed to allow students to enter campus with temporary access for the next 24 hours for those unable to schedule a coronavirus test. 
MySHR portal reopened after 6 p.m. Tuesday to schedule testing appointments, Van Orman said.
USC Student Health recommends students who traveled over Thanksgiving break to receive testing by Thursday or three to five days after arriving to Los Angeles. Nearly 10,000 students tested on Monday and an additional 10,000 students tested Tuesday, While post-Thanksgiving numbers are preliminary, Van Orman said rates appear significantly higher than previous weeks.
While Los Angeles remains a low prevalence area for the coronavirus, Van Orman said students could return from higher prevalence areas where they may have participated in large family gatherings and should remain alert for symptoms.
The World Health Organization classified the Omicron variant -as a “highly transmissible variant of concern,” although little is currently known about the variant. When looking at new variants, Van Orman said there are four main categories of importance — the effectiveness of available vaccines, the infectious nature of the variant, the severity of the disease and its susceptibility. 
The newest variant is concerning because of the large amount of mutations, indicating that it could be less receptive to the vaccine. Van Orman said there was still no data to show that the vaccine is ineffective against the mutations in the Omicron variant.
The University tests its own saliva samples for the coronavirus, tracking variants and picking up suspect patterns in further tested samples, and will continue to monitor for any presence of the Omicron variant within the USC community. With little known about the variant, there is growing concern over a fifth coronavirus surge this winter and how Omicron could impact that, Van Orman said.
Student Health continues to recommend students receive their booster shot by making an appointment through their MySHR portals. The Lyon Center is also accepting walk-ins for booster shots, Van Orman said. 
Influenza remains a growing concern for the community as cases appear at USC. Student Health encourages students to get vaccinated for the flu as soon as possible. The University has imposed a deadline of Dec. 17 for students to receive their flu vaccine or they will be unable to return to campus. Flu shot rates are currently close to 75% for students, faculty and staff, according to Van Orman.
For the upcoming semester, Van Orman said little coronavirus guideline changes are expected as cases remain an issue. Growing travel guidelines between countries for non-citizens, and contingency plans for international travel and quarantine might be put in place as the situation with the new variant continues to develop.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence.
Former USC gynecologist George Tyndall appeared in a preliminary hearing Tuesday morning for his criminal case before Judge Larry Paul Fuller at the Clara Foltz Criminal Justice Center. 
In July 2020, Tyndall pleaded not guilty to all 35 felony charges brought against him by the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, including 23 counts of unlawful penetration and 12 counts of sexual battery.
USC reached a settlement with survivors of Tyndall’s abuse in March in a separate class action lawsuit, paying out $852 million to more than 700 former patients accrued during his 30-year career at the university. 
Before the start of the hearing, Tyndall waived his right to a continuous hearing at the judge’s suggestion. The court will convene Wednesday and Thursday morning to present further evidence.  
USC students Jane Doe #14 and Jane Doe #16, who wished to remain anonymous to the media, then testified about the details of Tyndall’s sexual abuse.  
Both students, insured by USC Student Health and subsequently obligated to use the Engemann Student Health Center, said they could only schedule gynecology appointments with Tyndall because of the limited number of female practitioners. Doe #14 also alleged Tyndall would not continue prescribing her birth control without scheduling additional appointments.
The former students both testified that Tyndall gave a pelvic examination as part of the appointment, but did not provide a discrete reason nor initially use tools standard to gynecological exams, such as a speculum. During the appointments, the students also alleged Tyndall acted in an inappropriate, unprofessional and invasive manner during their examinations, and that the experience was uncomfortable. Both described explicit instances of sexual battery that occurred during their appointments. 
Tyndall’s defense team asked the alleged victims during cross-examination if they received money as a result of the settlement in the class-action lawsuit against USC. Both students indicated that they did, but that their decision to testify went beyond monetary gain. 
Both said the 2018 Los Angeles Times article about Tyndall encouraged them to speak up about their experiences and validated their feelings of discomfort about their exams. 
Prosecutor Gloria Allred, in a statement to the Daily Trojan, said she is “confident” that George Tyndall will “be punished for his abhorrent behavior and that the women whom he sexually abused will be vindicated.”
“George Tyndall caused significant physical and emotional damage to thousands of young women during his almost 30-year career at U.S.C,” Allred wrote. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said it has made reforms following Tyndall’s departure in 2016, including hiring female physicians and revising exam policies. 
The United States Department of Education mandated further changes following their investigation that concluded in February 2020, including an overhaul of Title IX processes and a formal review of current and former employees’ response to reports of sex discrimination.
“The preliminary hearing will be terribly difficult for so many of the women he abused,” the statement read. “We’re deeply saddened that the hearing will bring up painful memories for survivors and the rest of our community.”
After this week’s hearing, the preliminary hearing will continue in January.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that GeorgeTyndall’s criminal trial will be held in January. The preliminary hearing will continue in January. A trial date has not yet been set. The article also incorrectly stated that Tyndall pleaded not guilty to 112 counts of sexual battery. He pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of sexual battery. The article also previously implied that all changes made by the University following the Los Angeles Times investigation on Tyndall were made as a result of a Title IX investigation from the United States Department of Education. The University implemented changes, such as increasing the number of female physicians on staff, beforehand. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

The Undergraduate Student Government inaugurated a new senator during the senate meeting Tuesday following speaker Ruben Romeo’s resignation Sunday night. 
Nick Yang was inaugurated by Chief Justice Ben Morain at the end of the meeting. Yang, who placed 13th in last spring’s senate election, was appointed according to USG bylaws stating the first runner-up be appointed to a vacancy. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Yang, a member of the USG wellness committee,  expressed a desire to take on mental health initiatives as he serves the remainder of the term. 
“I know from personal experience … getting an appointment at Engemann [Student Health Center] is very difficult,” Yang said. “I want to, perhaps, start a project … just making an appointment easier because I believe that we need to make all resources available to students.”
Before Yang was inaugurated, senator Devin Ayala presented on several of his projects, including plans to expand Fryft, either in proximity or hours, or transition it into a stipend-based program. He said the project stalled due to a lack of funding but hopes to continue the push to expand the program next semester.
“I met with the associate director of transportation [twice], and I proposed … these three options, maybe like ‘What are the stepping stones for that? What are some boundaries for this?’” Ayala said. “I was basically hit with that, it would not be ideal because funding is just not there, and then they will be bringing back the Campus Cruiser [program] for next semester, so basically, they don’t see any need for it.” 
He also informed the senate about the upcoming resident assistant strike scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. Friday. Ayala, an RA himself, said he’s served as a sort of liaison between USG and the RAs, and is hoping USG can help the RAs’ cause. 
“It’s just like amplifying the voices of the strike and the initiative,” Ayala said. “We’re just trying to cause a lot of commotion.”
Yang also expressed support for Ayala’s proposals for expanding the Fryft program and supporting RAs on strike. 
“USC should do their part and help them out financially,” Yang said. “I think it’s very unfair to have financial aid taken away just because someone’s an RA.”
Chief financial officer Adenike Makinde also announced the creation of two new funds — a Green Engagement Fund and an Accessibility Fund — which will provide funding for relevant events and projects for registered student organizations and students. The funds join four existing funds: the philanthropy fund, professional fund, academic and social recreation funds and performing & visual arts, cultural, and startup funds. The funds will begin accepting applications next semester. 
The Green Engagement Fund, revived since its creation in 2015, will focus on providing “an outlet for sustainability projects on or around campus that are for students and by students,” Makinde said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. Projects can range from compost bins to sustainability research in collaboration with professors.
The Accessiblity Fund is “completely new,” said Makinde, and will fund projects related to accessibility or assist in making events and programming more accessible. 
“We understand especially for that fund that [accessiblity] is a broad umbrella,” Makinde said. “Accessibility isn’t a one-way street where you fix one thing and it’s easy for everybody, but it’s supposed to help aid a lot of the activity around that.”

After a year-long process of choosing between more than 200 potential names, the Center for International and Public Affairs Naming Committee renamed the Center for International and Public Affairs after Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Nov. 18. The renaming followed years of student protests against the building’s previous namesake, former USC President and known eugenicist Rufus von KleinSmid. 
Medicine Crow graduated from USC in 1939 with a master’s degree in anthropology, making him the first member of the Apsáalooke (Crow) tribe to receive a master’s degree, and received an honorary doctoral degree in 2003. Medicine Crow was named the tribe’s last war chief after his service in the United States Army’s 103rd Infantry Division during World War II and worked as a tribal historian for the Apsáalooke (Crow) nation following. In 2009, Medicine Crow received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, from former President Barack Obama for his war contributions and work in Native American history. 
The Daily Trojan spoke with Medicine Crow’s son, Ronald Medicine Crow, Monday to discuss his father’s legacy at the University moving forward. 
This interview was edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: What was your reaction when you first heard the news about the building’s renaming? 
Ronald Medicine Crow: We were very surprised, and we were just so glad to hear such good news as that because USC was very important to Dad. He really enjoyed his schooling there, so it was kind of like a miracle that he was even able to go to school there in the first place, and it all came about with the good Lord making a way for him to be able to attend and obtain his master’s degree. 
DT: There’s already a middle school named after your father. What does it mean to have his alma mater name a building after him? 
RMC: It is something that we’re glad to see. As Native Americans, [it’s] not very often that something like this takes place, and only to certain individuals that have made something of themselves by getting an education and getting somewhere with it that this honor comes upon them. 
DT: It seems like education was a really important thing to your father, as well as to your family and to a lot of Indigenous individuals who are inspired by your father. How do you think he would have reacted to the news of the renaming? 
RMC: I’m sure he would have been very happy and proud that such a thing has occurred. When USC honored him in 2003 by giving him an honorary doctorate, one of his closing remarks after he gave a short talk was that he said he was very proud to be a member of USC’s academia. And after he said that … the crowd just roared — all the graduates, all the guests, all the faculty just roared. Students gave him a standing ovation. That was something very spontaneous that no doubt surprised him, but at the same time, he wasn’t very surprised at all. 
DT: Did you have any other lessons or values that your father taught you regarding anything, whether it be education or being a good person?
RMC: Dad was involved in a lot of projects, a lot of things that come his way that he was more than willing to help … A small filming company came out of Canada to do some work here on the Crow reservation, and Dad was involved with that project. He was given a role in this short movie about a tribe that has lost their way in the wilderness, and they lost their identity, their clan system and their tribalism. 
Dad had this role as the chief to the main tribe, and they assimilated this lost tribe as they were being assimilated and introduced to the various clans and the rest of the tribal members. Dad was given a role as a chief to instruct these new lost tribe members and assimilate them back into their tribe. 
One thing that he said that more or less sums up his own life … and the way he lived his life, he was given these words. This motto, slogan or however you want to put it, words of wisdom, words of instruction to people who need a lot of help in getting ahead in life. There are four quotes that he made … The first quote he says, “Honor comes to him by the life you live.” Second one, “Honor comes to him by the prayers that you make.” Third one, “Honor comes to him by the sacrifices you make.” The fourth one, “Honor comes to him by the accomplishments that you achieve in life.” 
That pretty well sums up Dad’s life, because all those things he lived … and that’s why he’s so honored today. 
DT: When future Native American and Indigenous students pass by the building in years to come, how do you hope they would react? 
RMC: It’s important to us, as a family, as a Crow tribe of Indians here in Montana, and to Indian tribes throughout all of America, that this honor just doesn’t fall on me and my family and the Crow tribe. This honor goes to all Native Americans and tribes of America, and I’m sure that it’s something that’s very good news to all these other Indian tribes — that a Native American can be recognized at a major university. That speaks volumes about how people highly respect Native Americans and honor him in such a manner. That is something that is just overwhelming, and it made a lot of people happy. 
I’m sure Native Americans across the country, including Alaska, the Hawaiian Islands, Puerto Rico, [know] that a person of color can accomplish something in their life and be honored even years after their passing. This is another part of his legacy that he’s passed on, not just to us family members, but to all of America, Native American Indians everywhere, indigenous to this continent. 
DT: President Carol Folt also announced she would create a scholarship program for Native American students in your father’s name. What are your thoughts on this, especially because your father attended USC on a scholarship. What does this mean for you and your family? 
RMC: [The scholarship] was something that I just threw in as a suggestion. I didn’t realize that the President would take it serious. I think it’s more than fitting that other Indian students will be given opportunity, not just Crow tribal members, but any tribe throughout the country that is willing to further their education. 
I’m sure [Native American students] will be inspired to follow … and they’ll be inspired to come to USC as a place where Native Americans are more than welcome, and they’re not excluded. They’re welcome to come and complete their higher education and so forth … Whatever they’re striving for and will obtain at USC.

Early December is a stressful time of year for many. Whether it’s studying for finals, going back home for winter break or celebrating the holidays, there is a lot going on in the coming weeks. Everyone needs a distraction every once in a while. So whether you’re procrastinating on studying or avoiding relatives you haven’t seen in years, here are some of the best TV shows and movies available to stream this month. 
HBO Max 
“And Just Like That…” — Dec. 9 
The sequel to groundbreaking series “Sex and the City” features actresses Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon reprising their roles from the original series. One notable absence is that of actress Kim Cattrall, who played Samantha Jones in the first iteration of the show. 
This follow up to the Emmy-winning original depicts Carrie Bradshaw’s adventures and friends who are thriving as women in their fifties in New York City. They’re older and wiser than when they were last depicted onscreen, and the series will likely tackle these differences in a way only “Sex and the City” can (over cosmos). The show is also trying to grow along with its main characters, as it will feature a new non-binary and LGBTQ+ regular named Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez). So whether you’re a die-hard fan of the original or you want to see a modern twist on classic early 2000s television, this is the show for you. 
“The Matrix Resurrections” — Dec. 22 
It’s time to see how deep the rabbit hole goes in “The Matrix Resurrections.” Starring Keanu Reeves as Neo, along with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Morpheus and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising her role as Trinity, “Resurrections” is the third sequel to the film that changed the Sci-fi genre forever. 
Directed by just Lana Wachowski, as Lilly Wachowski chose to not be involved with the project, the film’s plot still remains unknown. It is speculated that it takes place in an alternate timeline before “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The Matrix Revolutions.” The film’s trailer shows that Neo has found himself stuck in the matrix again, and depicts his fight to escape the evil AI enslaving the human race. Even without knowing the plot, we can expect breathtaking action sequences and mind blowing revelations as The One battles his way to freedom. 
Netflix  
“The Witcher” Season 2 — Dec. 17 
Starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, “The Witcher” is an action-packed fantasy adventure in the same vein of “Game of Thrones.” The show details the travels of Geralt as he explores “the Continent.” He is also accompanied by Princess Ciri (Freya Allan) who is connected to Geralt through destiny. 
“The Witcher” is based off of the book series of the same name. The first season followed the books “The Last Wish” and “Sword of Destiny,” which are a collection of short stories that take place before the series’ main events. Season 2 will get more into the thick of the main story. Get ready for even more sword battles and scenes of Henry Cavill silently pondering something.
“Don’t Look Up” — Dec. 24
Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence star as two unheralded astronomers who are desperately trying to warn the Earth of an incoming comet; one that would destroy the world. The only problem is no one is taking them seriously. The film follows their exploits as they try to alert the public in hope someone will be able to save the world.
The film, directed by Adam McKay, is a dark comedy that hinges on the idea that the world is too apathetic to care about anything — apocalyptic or not. This is an idea that resonates even more considering the actions (or lack thereof) people took during the coronavirus pandemic. Featuring a star-studded supporting cast composed of Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Ron Perlman, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet and more, this film is guaranteed to be as funny as it is frustrating.
Disney+
“The Book of Boba Fett” — Dec. 29
Everyone’s favorite bounty hunter is back.
A spinoff of the wildly successful show “The Mandalorian,” the show follows the titular bounty hunter (Temuera Morrison) and his partner, Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) as they try and stake their claim in planets once controlled by the mob boss Jabba the Hutt.
 The show is the first successful attempt in getting a stand-alone story featuring Boba Fett. Ever since his appearance in “The Empire Strikes Back,” fans of “Star Wars” have been itching for the character to get more screen time. However, you don’t have to be a diehard “Star Wars” fan to enjoy this show. If it’s anything like its predecessor, it’s going to be an expertly crafted and deliberate show that feels more like a Western than a Sci-fi program.
 Amazon Prime Video 
“Harlem” — Dec. 3
 This series follows the exploits of four Black women in their mid-twenties living in Harlem.

Cafe Dulce is rightfully loved by many at USC. Its USC Village location, chic decor, trendy bops and efficient service make it hard not to join its ever so long line. Its stylish baristas and ample study room don’t hurt either.
Despite the constant wait, there’s something at Dulce for everyone. But for that same reason, it can be intimidating to choose from the menu. Many stick to their morning coffee, but daring to go beyond will unlock the tastiest world the USC Village has to offer. Without further ado, here are your must-order Dulce staples.
Pastries
Classic Brick Toast
The brick toast is an amazing reprieve from Dulce’s sweeter and more unsightly pastries. If you’ve ever spent your time inside the cafe wondering why anyone would need to put bacon on a donut, this one’s for you. The toast mirrors Taiwanese pastries commonly sold in boba shops. Although Dulce’s Brick Toast may not be the most glamorous item, it packs so much flavor. I would even argue that it packs the most flavor. When warmed up, the toasted white bread provides a satisfying pull — one that deserves an ASMR feature. I prefer the classic brick toast, but the green tea version is still highly popular. 
Strawberry Cream Donut
Forget the cherry on top — a strawberry on top is so much better. Dulce’s strawberry cream donut is not just nice to look at, it carries the perfect level of not-too-sweet sweetness. Instead of opting to fill the donut, the cafe tops it with a light whipped cream. Beware — this one can get a bit messy — but I promise it’s worth all the effort.
Breakfast
Dulce Breakfast Burrito
Dulce’s Breakfast Burrito is a top seller, and for very good reason. The combination of scrambled eggs, gooey cheese and perfectly roasted potatoes are what really hit the spot. It’s why the cafe prepared 17,000 breakfast burritos in Spring 2019. The burrito originally comes with bacon but has a variety of substitutes that accommodate everyone, such as avocado, turkey sausage and pork sausage. I recommend ordering it with extra cheese. It costs another 50 cents but provides that beautiful cheese pull you deserve as you devour your morning burrito. Don’t forget to top it off with Dulce’s salsa as well for spice.
Dulce Breakfast Sandwich
Dulce’s (secret?) mustard sauce is what makes the Breakfast Sandwich better than the average. It has a simple ingredient list that could honestly be prepared in five minutes at home — spinach, toasted bread and an egg. The ham protein can also be switched out for turkey or avocado and the egg is always cooked to medium perfection. If you’re looking for an even cheesier and tangier alternative to the Breakfast Burrito, this one’s for you.
Lunch
Pastrami Sandwich
There’s definitely a reason this sandwich is called a pastrami sandwich and not a Reuben. The burger’s whopping amount of cheese definitely isn’t kosher and is also highly unnecessary. Still, the pastrami burger satisfies your finer tastes with a fresh brioche bun. The dill pickles are a bit too sour when paired with the house slaw, but the high-quality pastrami makes that all very easy to overlook. 
Pesto Chicken
Calling all ciabatta bread lovers! It makes sense why the pesto chicken was the second most ordered sandwich item in Spring 2019. Its quality ingredients provide a heap of flavor, doing it more subtly than the breakfast burrito. Consider this entry a sleeping giant. It’s perfect for when you don’t want a breakfast burrito’s heaviness but still want to enjoy a flavorful meal. Its fontina cheese, roasted peppers, pesto sauce and chicken breast are all served on two hearty slices of ciabatta bread, but, if you can’t finish it, feel free to direct your attention to the delicious side of organic mixed greens that accompany it.
Basket of Fries 
Ah, the Basket of Fries. Just the thought of acquiring three days’ worth of fries in one go warms my heart. This gem is still prone to sogginess, so best to eat it with a friend or two. The best part about Dulce is its sentimental value, and you haven’t truly experienced the meaning of the cafe if you haven’t leisurely picked at these fries with classmates after a hazy lecture. Freshmen especially should take note of this one, as it’s the perfect way to make friends as we revive campus.

When one envisions rebellion, they might picture rebels flinging Molotov cocktails at police cars and oppressive institutions engulfed in the flames as collective chants for justice permeate the air.
But Arielle Toney, a fifth-year senior majoring in art, envisions something a bit different. Her rebellion is a small handmade booklet, filled with confessional drawings and musings. It’s a medium that has been used by a breadth of creators — from punk rockers of the ’90s to radical activists and mutual aid orgs to even cartoonists and painters: the zine. 
Her silent rebellion is steadily making noise among USC’s artistic community.
“At its core, the reason [zines have been getting popular] would be everyone needs an outlet, especially in these last few years that have just been storm on top of storm,” Toney said. “And social media has been getting increasingly polarized or censored or policed.”
Toney began crafting zines in Roski School of Art and Design professor Jennifer West’s “Riot Grrrl” zine class her sophomore year. It was in that class that she learned about how the riot grrrl movement — a movement in the 1990s focused on making safe spaces for women, femmes and queer people in punk — used handmade booklets filled with manifestos to mobilize the marginalized.
It’s through this ethos of bringing power and platform to unheard minorities that she drew her first zine, “Bunny Brain.” In the zine, Toney uses seemingly “juvenile” visual motifs, such as hearts, the color pink and doodles, to investigate her complex relationship with femininity as a Black woman coming from a majority white school in Texas.
At the end of the zine, Toney poses a question: “Is this too straightforward for your gallery? Which keeps this from being art, my voice or the hearts?”
Like Toney’s pervasive question, Dawn Stahura, a zine librarian and expert at Broward College in Fort Lauderdale, explains that zines exist as a means to reject mainstream notions of validity and importance. They challenge the spaces that marginalized communities have historically been shut out from, like the publishing industry.
“Speaking from an [LGBTQ+] community perspective, I think, in general, zines and comics and stuff … They’re so much less policed than if you wanted to make, like a full-fledged animated show, or, even if you wanted to publish it into a book, you can easily self-publish this sort of stuff on your own,” Toney said. “You don’t need anyone’s permission, and you don’t need to change anything to fit an industry standard. It’s just all you on the page.”
It’s this ability to be personal and confessional through these small, cheap inkjet booklets printed on copy paper that Zoe Alameda, a junior majoring in fine arts, finds liberating.
“It’s nice because people know you made it, but, because it’s in a book and not your [Instagram] profile, it’s like disconnected in a weird way, which is nice because you get to reveal more. I find myself revealing more about myself in these zines rather than posting on my story how I feel,” Alameda said. “Which is very cathartic because you can do it in a form of art rather than just as a written vent post.”
Alameda’s work consists of eclectic artistic perzines (or personal zines) filled with collected and hoarded imagery that is compiled, shredded and manipulated. She sometimes will write directly on a copy and even add found objects such as crumbled receipts. 
From memes to non sequitur “cursed imagery,” Alameda’s disjointed, discordant composition of images mimic Gen Z’s convoluted relationship between digital and physical realities, zines filled with fragmented scraps that reflect Gen Z’s chaotic media consumption. 
Alameda began making comic books in high school, which led them to learn about zine fests — festivals where zinesters and small artists sell their self-published work. Once they learned about this thriving community in Southern California, they began crafting and selling zines.
Alameda enjoys the freedom of zines as well as their accessibility. 
“Back to that notion of like ‘Zines can be for anybody, made by anybody,’ you don’t have to be a big person to or have a lot of money to make these things. It’s something that you can just DIY and have out and publish.” Alameda said. “[The zine community] just adds to people getting to see each other’s stuff without [being] like, ‘Oh, this is so high standard, like no one’s allowed to touch it except for these people.’ Anybody can access it, which is really great.”
The amorphous definition of what a zine can be and who can access it allows Nicholas Forman, a freshman majoring in media arts and practices, to use the medium as a space for experimentation and spontaneous creative bursts.
“ [I’m] always using it as some sort of little exploration, like a little learning process and trying to find something new in myself through [making zines],” Forman said.
His zines are filled with vibrant, hazy scraps of collage, drawings and heavily digitally manipulated photos and media. One of his zines, “a scroll zine,” is a mini one-page booklet that features cacophonous, gritty-edited screenshots of Forman’s screen-recordings that show him scrolling through Instagram.
For Forman and many other zinesters on campus, the physicality of zines provide a way to bring ideas to the forefront in a more concrete manner, especially with the transient nature of social media. 
“[A zine] is not just something you can scroll past, it’s something that you should read and you should look at,” Forman said. “And so I think it was kind of almost this, a little bit of this obligation created when someone’s giving you this piece of paper thing, and you’re like, ‘I guess I should look at it.’”
Zines are mediums where creators can place themselves at the forefront of conversations that might never be facilitated on a college campus. 
Stahura explains how zine creators can, in a sense, become the experts and facilitators of their own experiences through this handcrafted medium. 
“So many students feel a complete disconnect between the lives that they lead, the communities that they live in, how they identify and the shit they’re learning in college,” Stahura said. “We have a hard time with certain groups feeling like they even belong on campus or … higher ed institutions. And I think that zines are that one space where you can create a sense of belonging. ”
It’s this sense of belonging that Toney felt through her “Bunny Brain” zine after sharing it in class and receiving support from her classmates. It’s through this same desire for community that she founded the Visual Narrative Society, a club that creates space and time for students to work on their narrative artwork such as zines, comics and animations.
VNS will host a comic book fair in the Lindhurst Gallery Dec. 7, which will highlight students’ self-published and self-printed zines and comics. The event will serve as a space to bring student’s self-published artwork into the forefront of the greater USC community.
“But my hope for the club [is to] provide a regular meeting space to create work and show work with your peers that isn’t necessarily for a grade,” Toney said. 
Stahura believes the creation of a platform for zines — whether through a comic fair or even through the acknowledgement of zines through a school’s library (where USC Special Collections have collected student zines in Doheny Memorial Library) — is transformative for students who may feel like they don’t have a place in the greater college campus.
“[Having a zine collection on campus] means, for every zine that enters the zine collection, the institution, you are literally changing the landscape of a library’s collection,” Stahura said. “There are now going to be stories that are going to be able to be heard, that are written not only by students, but I can guarantee you by groups that have very low visibility in mainstream media and in the scholarship… That’s powerful.”

USC’s undefeated men’s basketball team will open up its Pac-12 schedule Wednesday against Utah at Galen Center. Utah enters the game with a 5-1 record, with its only loss to No. 12 BYU. After winning the Wooden Legacy Tournament last week, No. 20 USC is favored to win the game by 3.5 points. 
Defense has been the primary factor behind the Trojans’ early success, as USC allows the second-fewest points per game in the Pac-12 behind Arizona. The Trojans also nationally rank in the top-10 in defensive rebounds per game. 
Junior forward Isaiah Mobley has started the season averaging 9.2 rebounds per game. With senior guard Drew Peterson, redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin and Mobley at or over 6’9”, USC’s length forces other teams to settle for low-percentage shots. On average, teams have made 34.4% of their shots against the Trojans, the sixth lowest in college basketball. 
USC’s defense was on display in its victory over San Diego State who the Trojans held to only 15 points in the first half.
USC’s offense has averaged 78.2 points per game. SDSU’s defense is in the top-40 nationally in points allowed per game.
“We’re trying to continue the style of play we had last year,” Peterson said Tuesday after practice. “I think we showed against San Diego State how tough we are defensively.” 
The Trojans offense ranks outside of the top-50 in points per game and could be an issue as the Trojans face other defenses. The Utes defense has allowed only 60.2 points per game, just behind San Diego State. 
“Utah’s a very good team,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield. “They have size; and they have a lot of shooting; and they’re excellent position defenders.” 
Mobley, Goodwin and junior guard Boogie Ellis have all performed well offensively this year, averaging in the double digits in points per game. Mobley scored a season-high 18 points against SDSU and played a large role in USC’s win. 
Mobley spoke about his mentality during the low-scoring game. 
“Be aggressive and do what is necessary for our team to win,” Mobley said. “I knew that’s what it would take, so I tried to bring that to the table.”
However, free throw shooting has been an issue for USC. The Trojans are shooting 57.7% from the free throw line as a team, ranking in the bottom ten of the 358 Division 1 basketball teams. Three of USC’s starters, Peterson, Mobley, and junior guard Ethan Anderson, shoot at or below 50% at the free throw line. 
“A few of our big guys need to be more consistent from the foul line,” Enfield said. 
The Utes offense is led by junior center Branden Carlson, a 7-footer averaging 15.7 points and 7 rebounds per game. Carlson is having his best scoring season of his career so far and will be the Trojans first test against a huge center this season.
Additionally, senior guard David Jenkins Jr. has been Utah’s most accurate 3-point and free throw shooter among the team’s starters, shooting 41.9% and 90.9% respectively. As a whole, Utah has been accurate from the free throw line, shooting 77.5%. Restraining from fouling will be a crucial aspect of USC’s path to victory in this game. 
The game will tip off at 8:30 p.m. and can be streamed on the Pac-12 Network.

No. 1 men’s water polo is headed to its 17th straight NCAA tournament, and it has one very good reason for why it can win it all: mustaches.
Players trickled into Uytengsu Aquatics Center before Tuesday’s practice, sporting smiles and their version of a mustache, ranging from full Mario-style facial hair to light stubble across upper lips. 
The “NCAA mustache” is a tradition that goes back years for reasons some of the seniors don’t even know. But it’s a way for the team to bond before the big tournament that its entire season has led up to.
The Trojans nabbed the top seed in the NCAA tourney, which gives them an immediate semifinal berth. USC will play either No. 4 Long Beach State or No. 7 UC Davis in the semifinal. 
On the other side of the bracket, joint No. 1 UCLA and No. 10 Princeton will fight for a semifinal berth against No. 3 UC Berkeley.
“[We’re] ready. We’ve been there 17 times in a row now. The pressure is always there,” Head Coach Marko Pintaric said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “This is the postseason, so everything is magnified … We’re looking good, and the team’s looking ready.”
The team enters the tournament with a 17-2 record, both losses coming from a one-goal difference against UC Berkeley and UCLA, and a roster stacked with accolades from this season. 
Two All-MPSF First Team selections, redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep and senior goalie Nic Porter, lead the charge. 
Mercep scored 44 goals this season to bring his career total to 196, good for fourth all-time in USC history. Porter is also fourth all-time in saves at 652 and will likely move up to third in his last games as a Trojan; he’s 13 behind Kevin Stringer, who has held the record since 1987.
Senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt, redshirt junior driver and 2020 Tokyo Olympian Hannes Daube, and redshirt junior driver Ashworth Molthen earned All-MPSF Second Team nods, with sophomore driver Carson Kranz receiving an Honorable Mention for his 20-goal season. These six will be expected to show on the biggest stage this weekend why they’re some of the top players in the country, Pintaric said.
“That’s why you come to USC,” Pintaric said. “[We tell] our recruits, ‘If you’re not ready for these big moments, these big games, this is not the right place for you.’ So our players are always [ready] wherever we play.”
The Trojans have faced both of their potential semi-final opponents UC Davis and Long Beach State this season. 
USC defeated Davis twice in September and Long Beach, 13-9, in October. If the Trojans face the Aggies, Mercep has their number. The lefty from Croatia scored 10 goals against UC Davis, including a seven-goal explosion in the first meeting to tie his USC single game career high. In his last games as a Trojan, he hopes to bring home the title, no matter how many times he scratches the scoreboard.
“It’s like mixed emotions,” Mercep said. “I’m sad, but I’m also excited. Hopefully, we win. That’s all that’s in my mind right now.”
While visions of a title win at rival UCLA’s home pool are intoxicating, the team has been laser focused on the details.
“This whole week has been just a mental preparation for us,” Ehrhardt said. “It’s been a whole season of us training hard every day, conditioning in the mornings and lifting in the afternoons to get our bodies ready. But [now] it’s a lot of detail-oriented meetings for us to get down to the nitty gritty … It’s gonna come down to our belief in our system, which I know we have 100%.”
The Trojans feel prepared to win their 11th National Championship. And of course, they have mustaches. 
Well, not all of them do.
“For me personally, I just don’t think it’s a good look,” Ehrhardt said. “You know, look good, play good. That’s my philosophy going into this weekend … But we’ve got a lot of good mustaches on the team … so I think we got the tradition going [strong.]”
Not everyone on the team may be on board with the mustaches, but they’re unified under their ultimate goal: a NCAA title. 
The chase for the hardware begins Saturday, when USC and its mustaches take on the winner between Long Beach State and UC Davis at 2 p.m at Uytengsu.

It’s finally the end of the semester.
Who would’ve thought that we would make it this far? Looking back, there were so many uncertainties and obstacles we had to face. I am sure you, dear reader, also had your own hurdles to overcome. So be sure to pat yourself on the back for all that you have managed to accomplish. It’s not always easy to be kind to ourselves, especially when we think we are the only ones struggling.
In light of this honest discussion, allow me to peel back the curtain a bit and talk about what helped me navigate through these unprecedented times: “Katamari Damacy.” 
Yes, that game where your entire objective is to make a ball bigger by rolling up different items under a certain time limit. No, I am not joking.
Trust me, I, too, once scoffed at my friend when he recommended this game to me. 
At the time, I was about to move back to the United States after spending almost two years inside my childhood home in Brazil. My anxiety was through the roof, and all I did to treat it was turning off my brain and grinding out a plethora of forgettable gacha games, a process that made me sleep an average of four hours a night. 
Still, I held my friend’s suggestion in disdain. After all, what could a game as simple as that provide me?
The answer? Fun.
It sounds almost too obvious to be true, but at the time, it felt like a grand revelation. I was so used to being in a dark place emotionally that I didn’t even consider the possibility of leaving it. 
But, when I started playing Katamari, I finally realized how miserable I had been for the longest time. Just like how you only realize you’re hungry once food is laying right in front of you. 
This “discovery” sparked my curiosity, and I started to research about the game’s development. In the process, I found out that “Katamari’s” creator, Keita Takahashi, has a very unique perspective on video games, aiming to transmit happiness in almost a childish way. 
Perhaps what surprised me the most was finding out he, too, was struggling. In an interview with GamesIndustry, Takahashi expressed doubts about the ability of “Katamari” to make people happier, even as the game gained critical and commercial success. Before the launch of “Wattam,” one of his most recent games, he expressed similar feelings and wondered if anyone would enjoy the game. 
That was what finally woke me up.
For some reason, I expected the creator of these bright, cheerful games to be an equally happy person. But, the more I read about Takahashi, the more I understood that his games were closer to symbols of defiant joy in a sea of struggle than a product of baseless optimism. 
Even though he faces his own issues, he still does what only he can do and constantly tries to make the world a better place through his creations. 
For me, that is nothing short of inspirational.
Naturally, this made me re-evaluate not only my overall approach toward life but to esports themselves. Since most esports scenes are heavily saturated with business discussions, partnerships and gaudy optics, it is quite easy to develop a distaste for it. But doing would mean forgetting what made these scenes big in the first place: the sheer amount of fun people have when playing the game. 
Regardless of what your tastes are, there is likely a game out there that you would enjoy watching someone play. And even if it happens to have a small following, odds are you will still get some fun out of it, even if that comes from joining the professional scene yourself. 
After all, video games are always meant to be played, and having a small competitive scene only means the barrier to entry is low. 
But perhaps the biggest takeaway Takahashi’s perspective can provide for us is a better understanding of what makes esports so unique. Because while all professional sports rely on people having fun, only in esports can we name those who have actually crafted that experience from the ground up. 
If it were not for the developers who have dedicated hours of their lives to creating their games, hoping to inspire joy into the lives of others, none of this professional world would have been possible. 
I hope that, you, dear reader, see this column not only as a sentimental analysis of what makes esports great at its core but also as an invitation to genuinely explore this world. While it definitely may seem daunting at first, it is by far one of the most rewarding experiences in professional sports. 
Even if you do not feel any desire to sit down and watch a gaming tournament, I still suggest that you give video games an earnest try. You will soon find out that they have the potential to truly be life-changingexperiences. Once you do, be sure to let me know. Because while we may each enjoy different types of games, we certainly do not have to be lonely rolling stars.

In June 2020, during the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, the global pandemic and Asian American hate, USC temporarily renamed the Rufus von KleinSmid Center to the Center for Public and International Affairs. On Nov. 18, President Carol Folt announced the official renaming of the building to the Dr. Joseph Crow Center for International and Public Affairs. 
Von KleinSmid was not only an active supporter of eugenics but also of the Japanese internment movement during World War II. Under von KleinSmid’s tenure, the University denied readmission to Japanese American USC students displaced by internment camps and locked their records so that transfering to other colleges would be impossible. These students were “Nisei,” a term that describes Japanese Americans with immigrant parents who had citizenship by birth. 
In October, USC announced it would issue a formal apology to the Japanese Americans whose educations it disrupted. As a part of this apology, President Carol Folt will deliver a speech and issue honorary diplomas to an estimated 121 Nisei students at the Asian Pacific Alumni Association Gala in April. 
For many, USC’s actions pave the way forward. It is not always easy for large institutions to admit their mistakes and make active, public efforts to fix them. For others, however, USC’s steps may potentially add to Asian American marginalization. 
For the past several decades, Asian Americans of various ethnicities, cultures and experiences have been seen as the “model minority.” Many Asian immigrants who come to the United States to live a better life have suffered and tolerated hate and prejudice. It is also true that this quiet perseverance has, until recently, rendered anti-Asian racism invisible. 
According to a clinical article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, “Public awareness of crimes against Asian Americans increased in February 2021 only because of a boost from social media and subsequent attention by national news outlets.”
Presently, USC’s actions are concerning. USC students have demanded renaming CPA and issuing degrees to Nisei students for the past few decades. Given that it took both national BLM protests and the global pandemic for USC to implement these changes, USC inadvertently pushes the notion that awareness around Asian American hate is merely a part of the Black and white racial dichotomy.
In times like these, we need genuine, enduring change. The Asian American community does not need any more short-lived headlines. Despite the model minority myth, anti-Asian American racism warrants fervid and persistent dedication. USC needs to do more than just implement a name change or issue diplomas. What use is a name change if the majority of upperclassmen, alumni and faculty still refer to the renamed CPA as VKC? In the same vein, what use is a diploma if the recipients have either passed away or have no use for one now? 
USC’s changes may sound impressive on paper, but they accomplish nothing in terms of longevity. As a result, USC will actually harm the movement against Asian American hate by adding to the notion that racism toward Asian Americans is invisible and insignificant. 
Right now, USC needs to take further steps to properly educate its student body about the reasons for both the name change and Nisei degrees. It needs to foster real discussion about how the institution failed its students, why its actions were wrong and what steps it will take to remedy the issue. 
In this regard, USC still has room to improve. In addition to President Folt’s speech, USC could also empower the voices of Nisei students and the families that were impacted. USC Visions and Voices, for example, is a perfect way to help spread these stories to the student body. Instead of big headlines and ceremonial apologies, detailing the experiences provide not only a deeper insight but also a direct acknowledgement of Asian American hate.
USC must also continue the conversation. In an article regarding a panel from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s chapter of the Asian American Journalist Association, “The plight of Asian Americans does not just end after one panel — the conversation must keep going until real change is seen.” 
Ultimately, USC cannot jump from one crisis to another — it must be persistent in its efforts. Only with this form of acknowledgement can there be a genuine change, and only with this genuine change can healing occur for those impacted.

We often talk about reversing anthropogenic climate change before it’s too late. But, if this year’s climate conference told us anything, we still refuse to accept the direness of the situation. 
Each year, without fail, we push back our emissions-reductions deadlines and lower our expectations for change in the name of preserving the global economic status quo. If we can outsource extra freshwater or rely on nonrenewable energy for a few more decades, what’s the rush in shaking things up?
However, in many places around the world, these near-future apocalyptic predictions are already a reality — climate change’s first victims have already suffered irreversible damage. Climate-induced migration is well underway, impacting some of the world’s most vulnerable regions and communities. Although many of us in Southern California can fend off the warming climate’s effects with good AC and diverted freshwater sources for the time being, climate change will inevitably impact all of us at some point. 
Migration and immigration are already hot-button issues, and it can be difficult to thoroughly define people’s reasons for moving. The term “climate refugee” connotes the issue in absolute terms, suggesting that the group is entitled to refugee rights. The term, mainly used by the media, is misleading because most climate-linked migration occurs countrywide rather than internationally. Additionally, the United Nations doesn’t recognize climate change as a viable cause for legal refugee status. 
For the sake of simplicity, I’m casting the widest net possible today. Climate-induced migration’s scope includes displacement because of climate-related changes such as sea level rise, desertification, ocean acidification, air pollution, changing weather patterns and intensified storms, the loss of biodiversity and humanitarian crises exacerbated by climate change. 
When it comes to media coverage of climate migration, the Pacific Island nations are a prime example. Sea levels have been rising at a rate of 12 millimeters per year in the western Pacific, slowly submerging low-lying islands and prompting an exodus to larger countries in their general vicinity.
Particularly, residents on the islands of Kiribati and Tuvalu, which are located only meters above sea level, face time-sensitive decisions about whether to remain on their sinking island or emigrate to nearby Australia or New Zealand, where job opportunities and sense of Pacific Island community are limited. 
Despite the situation’s severity, these tiny islands have little to no influence over global climate proceedings and minimal representation in climate summits. Many people who live in climate-induced migration areas around the world reflect this pattern as the canary in the coal mine so to speak. Their plight only moderately concerns larger nations and more powerful entities.
In many existing cases of climate migration, experts consider climate change a “threat multiplier,” exacerbating countries’ existing systemic issues. Climate-driven food and water insecurity can increase conflict over resources, consequently inciting violence and sometimes wars. 
For example, prolonged drought in Syria drove farmers and herders into overly-crowded urban areas, creating conditions for unrest that preceded their civil war. Similarly, Yemen’s citizens are highly vulnerable to drought, pests and rainfall patterns because much of the country’s economy depends on agriculture and rural resources, accelerating social differentiation and further cementing climate warming’s negative impacts. 
Although it’s unrealistic to designate migration patterns as solely driven by environmental factors, the number of migrants will likely continue to rise as environmental conditions change and place undue stress in areas that don’t have the resources or infrastructure to counteract them.
At some point, a significant percentage of the global population may fall under the “climate migrant” umbrella after moving for better opportunities, more comfortable living environments or safety from severe weather events.
What do we do when climate change displaces a majority of the world’s population? Whether migrants move inland to escape rising tides or leave a region lacking arable soil for crop production, human-caused climate changes do not only impact how we live our lives but also where we can realistically live them. 
Climate disruption not only makes world regions uninhabitable, but also compounds both food and water availability, which places pressure on the global supply chain. Not to mention the fact that forced migration impacts many irreplaceable intangible factors — culture, sense of community and traditions can be lost as we prioritize survival.
Climate change magnifies existing vulnerabilities, and moving away from an impacted area doesn’t necessarily guarantee a lack of problems moving forward. People will inevitably come to urban areas, and it would be in powerful countries’ best interests to strengthen infrastructure and prevent overcrowding. 
Simultaneously tackling adaptation and mitigation is a huge task, but powerful countries must involve local communities and empower those in developing nations and affected regions. All too often, global leaders fail to consider affected constituents in decision-making, which leads to ineffective policy. 
Establishing realistic, accessible and permanent pathways of migration while reducing emissions is the only way to go from here. Highly-trafficked countries and areas may protest, but at the end of the day, we’re a global community facing a global problem. The climate diaspora may have already begun, but we need to look beyond our own national self-interests and recognize that the stakes are bigger than any arbitrary political boundary.
