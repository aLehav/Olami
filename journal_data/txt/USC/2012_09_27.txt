The USC women’s soccer team (4-4-1, 1-0-0) prepares for its first out-of-state games of the season as it travels to Arizona to play Arizona State (4-5-0, 1-1-0) at 2 p.m. on Friday in Tempe, followed by a trip to Tucson to take on Arizona (5-4-1, 1-0-0) at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.

USC coach Ali Khosroshahin believes the upcoming games will challenge his squad.
“Both of the teams are ahead of us in the RPI formula,” Khosroshahin said. “For us, it’s an opportunity to position ourselves for an at-large bid. We got to bring it and play really well. They’ll be challenging games.”
The Women of Troy are coming off a victory in their first conference game of the season, a victory last Friday over Washington 1-0 on a goal by senior forward Samantha Johnson in the 100th minute. It was USC’s first shutout of the season, and a step in the right direction for a team that had previously allowed 2.12 goals per game, the worst average in the Pac-12. The defensive production was improved partially thanks to the return of senior Kristina Noriega (concussion) and redshirt sophomore Mia Bruno (quad strain).
“We just changed personnel defensively because we need more experience, so mentally we have an advantage,” Johnson said. “Kristina and Mia are back there and they’re helping Erin [Owen] a lot back there now. With experience, you make mature decisions — not making forced passes and holding onto the ball.”
USC has been good in the past against Arizona and Arizona State, going 12-4 lifetime against ASU and 14-3-1 lifetime against Arizona. USC beat both teams last year at McAlister Field, beating ASU 2-1 in overtime and shutting out Arizona 1-0. The Women of Troy have won the last five meetings against Arizona and have not lost to the Wildcats since 2004. USC also holds a record of 2-0-1 on the road in 2012.
“We’re feeling really excited coming off of our first conference win,” said Bruno, when asked about the upcoming games. “We know it’s going to be tough competition. It’s going to be hot out there. We had a really good week at training and we look good, so I think we’re going to go in with a lot of confidence.”
Both games will be televised regionally by the Pac-12 Networks.

After suffering its first loss of the season, the No. 3 USC women’s volleyball team looks to get back into the victory column this weekend, as it will take on Pacific Northwest rivals Washington and Washington State.
The Women of Troy, who currently hold a 13-1 record this season, will face off against the No. 5 Huskies on Friday night in Seattle before concluding their trip against the Cougars Sunday morning in Pullman. The matches will be the first road games the team will face in Pac-12 play.
Bounce back · After a loss to No. 8 Oregon, senior outside hitter Katie Fuller and USC will take on Washington and Washington State on the road. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
After a resounding four-set victory over No. 4 and crosstown rival UCLA on Sept. 19, the Women of Troy came into last Friday night’s home match against Oregon with superb momentum, but struggled on both sides of the ball and suffered their first loss and sweep of the season.
Although the team inched closer to the Ducks in the final set, they fell short of victory, dropping the match 3-0 (25-19, 25-15, 25-23). The loss marked the first time in 22 years that the Ducks triumphed over the Women of Troy on the road. Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller, arguably the team’s most consistent contributor so far, led the squad with nine kills, while freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio logged seven.
Besides Fuller and Bricio, only two others recorded at least five kills, while Oregon saw three players record double digits.
“I take responsibility for this outcome as much as the girls do,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We just weren’t prepared against a very good Oregon team.”
While it had not been enough of a factor to cost the team wins, offensive inaccuracy finally caught up with the Women of Troy, who attacked at a mere clip of .189. The second set particularly doomed the team, as they registered an attacking percentage of just .036 while notching just 15 points. Conversely, Oregon maintained offensive consistency throughout the match, attacking at .357 and twice surpassing .400 in a set.
The first set saw four ties but no lead changes, as Oregon jumped out in front and never looked back for the 25-19 win. Senior outside hitter Katherine Fischer put together a particularly strong set, notching six kills and the terminating shot to claim the set for the Ducks.
Oregon committed just two errors for the frame, and attacked at a game-high .486 percentage.
The second set saw mistake after mistake from the hosts, as the Women of Troy struggled to develop a rhythm. USC quickly saw its early 4-3 lead evaporate, as the Ducks recorded leads of 8-6 and 13-7 before finishing off the set and holding the Women of Troy to just 15 points.
The third frame was the most competitive effort from the Women of Troy, but the team fell short and dropped the set 25-23. The set featured six lead changes and 14 ties, but
USC failed to build on an early 9-7 lead and fell down the stretch. Senior outside hitter Alaina Bergsma recorded nine of  her match-high 18 kills in the set to finish off the Women of Troy.
As the team gears up for its weekend matches, Haley is particularly looking for defensive improvements.
“We absolutely need to improve the blocking. We’re facing a couple of good teams this weekend and we must focus,” Haley said. “I’d like to get more from Alexis Olgard, I’d like to get more from Natasa Siljkovic and I’d also like to see more from the youngsters like Hannah Schraer and Alicia Ogoms.”
Following their trip to Washington, the Women of Troy will return to the Galen Center to take on Arizona on Oct.  5 and Arizona State on Oct. 7.

The night of Stanford’s latest upset victory over USC is not my fondest memory.
After missing our return flight to Los Angeles that night, fellow editor Michael Katz and I slept over in San Francisco International Airport, sprawling out on a couple of benches beside a 24-hour Subway. Though sleeping beside vats of tuna fulfilled a life-long dream and curiously cleansed my mind of the night’s listless loss, I awoke bleary-eyed the next morning to stark reminders that USC’s season had been turned on its head.
Break · Just two weeks after senior quarterback Matt Barkley and No. 13 USC suffered a disappointing loss at Stanford, he and the Trojans have a weekend off. Meanwhile, the rest of the Pac-12 teams are in action. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
USC fans in the airport were noticeably less chatty than the day before nor as eager to flash the “Fight on!” sign. In line at a help desk trying to finagle my way higher onto the stand-by list for the first flight back to Los Angeles, I overheard a UCLA law student, who went to Stanford for his undergraduate degree, basking in USC’s misery.
He predicted the Bruins would run over the Trojans in the Rose Bowl, and spewed a lot of other noise about a shift in the balance of power on the L.A. college football scene. I tuned out the rest of his monologue when he started describing UCLA coach Jim Mora as the Second Coming.
Everyone needs to relax, as this particular fan likely learned when UCLA unceremoniously face-planted against Oregon State last Saturday, and I embraced that incomparable feeling of schadenfreude.
Though I’m likely in the minority, I welcome the breather from USC football that this bye week affords. Four games in, I’m already beckoning the sideline trainer to come over and administer the oxygen tank. I’m exhausted.
Most of my exhaustion stems from the comical overreactions of college football pundits, hastily passing judgment on the landscape of the sport after each weekend’s results. This Saturday, USC won’t need to put forth a tidy final box score in order to stay in the beauty pageant that is the BCS national title hunt.
For one week, I won’t have to listen to sports media disparage quarterback Matt Barkley, trying to tear down his legacy and argue — with straight faces no less — that he’s not even a late first-round draft pick anymore.
For one week, I can watch Oregon State implode after ESPN’s  Pac-12 blog predicted the Beavers will beat out USC to play in the Alamo Bowl. Just to let that ridiculous prediction fester for a moment, I’ll repeat: the Alamo Bowl.
For one week, I can just sit back and judge other teams, so, without further adieu, here’s my bye-week viewers’ guide for three intriguing Pac-12 matchups on Saturday:
 
Upset Special 
Arizona is beating Oregon State this weekend in the 7 p.m. matchup on Pac-12 Networks; book it. And if I’m wrong, I’ll forget to revisit my outrageous prediction next Monday.
Who could have predicted before the season started that the Pac-12’s two leading quarterbacks in passing yards per game entering week five would be Arizona’s Matt Scott and Oregon State’s Sean Mannion?
I could argue Arizona played better against Oregon than the 49-0 final score indicates, as the Wildcats’ offense reached the red zone six times without producing so much as a field goal, but I’m mostly predicting the upset based on a lack of faith in Oregon State.
I’m not convinced the Beavers are an upper-echelon team. In many ways, they’re the northern UCLA, capable of the occasional upset against a No. 20-ish team, but not consistent enough to win every game it should. I expect a hiccup here for what should be an average Pac-12 team at season’s end.
 
Change the Channel
I’m highlighting Saturday’s 7:30 p.m. Oregon-Washington State game on ESPN 2 not because I think it will be exciting, but for the opposite reason: It’s going to be a blowout. It’s always fun watching Oregon trample teams, and I question how deep into the first quarter fans will tolerate watching the game before reaching for the remote to find something more competitive and less scripted — professional wrestling, perhaps?
Even with season-ending injuries to All-Pac-12 safety John Boyett and four-year offensive guard starter Carson York, this is the best I’ve ever seen the Ducks for one simple reason: quarterback Marcus Mariota, who I firmly believe would have unseated Darron Thomas as the starter this season even if Thomas didn’t foolishly declare early for the 2012 NFL Draft. Mariota is completing 70 percent of his passes and has thrown 10 touchdowns to just two interceptions.
As an aside, is it just me, or does Washington State coach Mike Leach’s media sessions remind anyone else of Ron Paul’s debates?
 
Muddied Middle
Arizona State’s 1 p.m. visit to California’s Memorial Stadium does not inspire much national intrigue, but the matchup will go a long way toward sorting out the mediocre Pac-12 teams from the basement dwellers. Whichever team loses this contest is likely in for a long season, although the urgency is greater for Cal.
Among all Pac-12 coaches, Cal coach Jeff Tedford’s seat is probably hottest, mostly because, besides Oregon State’s Mike Reilly, he is the longest-tenured coach in the conference. Recent Pac-12 hires are given some latitude while they replenish their rosters with their own recruits who suit their systems.
Tedford has no such leeway, and, despite his success in revitalizing a Cal program that had not experienced a winning season in eight years when he took over in late 2001, fans want more. With a loss, the winningest coach in program history likely heads to the chopping block sooner than later. And bowl eligibility is in question for the Golden Bears as they sit at 1-3.
Admittedly, none of these matchups parallel the grandeur and excitement of Trojan football, but each game does offer noteworthy subplots. We can’t make many substantive conclusions from developments this weekend, but we should still pay attention. Each week brings us closer to crystallizing the 2012 Pac-12 picture.
Either way, enjoy your break, Trojan faithful. The Utes are less than a week away.

Hope you enjoyed eating your words last Saturday. There WAS a upset alright. But in Arizona. Earning Mike Riley his 75th win. Breaking the coaches wining history at Oregon State. Moving Beavers right up the poles. 3-0. Sean Mannion throwing for over 433 yards. Ranked top quarterback in pack 12. Do I need to mention Storm woods? Brandon Cooks? Michael Doctor? Beavs are all over the web. As the BIGGEST surprise of 2012. Those are just a few weapons. I’m hoping you’re predicting another upset for Beavs Saturday against wsu. It gives me great pleasure to watch the faces of the fools who underestimate us. Left dumbfounded when the clock runs out. Good luck to your Usc. I agree Matt Barkley IS a elite quarterback. That Usc is a great team. Imo, one of the best teams in pac12. Can’t wait til we play together. It will be one hell of a game.
Though I’m likely in the minority, I welcome the breather from USC football that this bye week affords. Four games in, I’m already beckoning the sideline trainer to come over and administer the oxygen tank. I’m exhuasted.
Should be “exhausted.”
Why schadenfreude in UCLA losing? For any team we play, especially our rivals, we want them going in to a game against us ranked as highly as possible. 
I’m all for basking in a UCLA loss. But that loss should be to us (and only us, ideally).

As the saying goes, there is no rest for the weary and so it is that the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team will have little rest this weekend as it plays five games in three days.
Busy · Senior two-meter Matt Burton has scored nine goals this season, good for third on the team. Burton and the No. 1 Trojans will host Princeton on Friday before traveling to Santa Barbara for the SoCal tournament on Saturday. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
“Every game is crucial,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “It’s all about being ready, not just for one game but for all of the games. It’s important to stay focused throughout all those games.”
The Trojans’ gauntlet of matches begins on Friday with a home game against No. 16 Princeton at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The two teams met twice last season, with USC (9-0, 1-0) winning each contest 13-4 and 17-4, the latter game coming in the NCAA tournament to knock Princeton out of contention for the national championship.
“They are always fired up to play us,” sophomore two-meter Jack Plaga said. “We just have to stay strong and wear them down.”
Princeton (7-4, 2-1) is known for its wide variety of defenses and unusual strategies, which is something that the Trojans are well aware of and are working hard to prepare against.
“Their coach comes up with a lot of trick plays,” senior two-meter Matt Burton said. “There’s always that element of waiting for a surprise; things where guys are diving under the water, things we’ve never really seen before.”
Trick plays and gimmicks are not unusual to USC. Because of its athletic superiority and historic run of success, lower-ranked teams often resort to these tactics in the absence of being able to compete “traditionally” with the Trojans.
“It’s smart by them to a certain degree,” Burton said. “They know that they might not be as fast or strong as we are, but they can outsmart us with trick plays and stuff like that so we have to be prepared.”
Vavic is confident that the team will be well prepared for any of the Tigers’ attempts at fooling the Trojans.
“Princeton is a fairly young team, and they like to play interesting defenses with different kinds of subs and splits,” Vavic said. “We are going to prepare for them and anticipate some of those different defenses.  We are a little more experienced [than their players], and I think we will be OK.”
After facing Princeton on Friday, USC will hit the road to Santa Barbara for the SoCal tournament.
The team will begin its quest to avenge last season’s disappointing fourth place finish in the tournament with a game against St. Francis (N.Y.) on Saturday.
In last season’s tournament, USC lost in the semifinals to Stanford and then to UCLA in the third place game.
“Last year, we screwed up big twice,” Burton said. “Back-to-back losses are something that never happens here, so we have to make sure that we don’t take any opponent lightly because on any given day we can be beat.”
The Trojans will have a chance to avenge last season’s disappointment, as both UCLA and Stanford are in the field this year.
As each team is also a fellow member of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, a potential matchup in a prestigious tournament would have substantial ramifications on a possible future NCAA tournament berth.
“Only two teams from our conference are going to make the NCAA tournament, so everything is crucial,” Vavic said.  “You cannot afford to suffer a big loss because losing to a team that is not from our conference can be an absolute killer.  We take every game extremely seriously.”
Though the team will have little time to rest between games, the players seem to be unconcerned with the possibility of tiring out by the end of the tournament.
“Tournaments are always tough,” Burton said.  “You’re playing two games in one day and you could easily get very tired.  But this usually works to our benefit because we are very well conditioned.”
Friday’s home game against Princeton will be at McDonald’s Swim Stadium at noon.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Wednesday, Sept. 26. 
Crimes against a person
at 7:25 a.m., a staff member reported that he was verbally assaulted in a Cardinal Gardens alley by a suspect who became irate about the way he was driving. The suspect drove away when the staff member stated that he was calling the police, and he could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 3:07 p.m., a student purchased a bicycle from an unidentified subject in a Downtown parking lot and brought it to the DPS office after observing that it had a registration sticker on it. DPS officers determined that the bike was registered to another student, but they were unable to contact her and there was no record of it being reported lost or stolen. The bike was then impounded until the matter could be resolved.
at 1:47 p.m., a student reported that he and several other students wired money to a travel agency for the purchase of airline tickets, and subsequent information he has received about the agency has caused him to believe it might be a fraud.
I know for a fact you guys are holding back DPS reports.   Who is running this cover-up?

Four burglaries struck the Orsini Apartments in Downtown Los Angeles this week, according to KPCC.
The incidents, which occurred between Friday night and Monday, totaled approximately $40,000 worth of items, including three laptops, several high-end hand bags and $1,800 in cash.
All four incidents occurred in units where residents had left their windows open, the LAPD told KPCC. Orsini, though a popular luxury housing option for many USC students, has long had a reputation for property crime. Two suspects in 2008 were taken into custody in connection with nine burglaries of the complex, according to a report by Curbed LA.
According to police, officers are currently investigating two suspects in connection to the crimes. As the complex has 24-hour doorman security and a gated parking garage, police suspect the burglaries to be an “inside job,” KPCC reported.
Though burglaries and car break-ins are nothing new at the Orsini, increased security detail and efforts by the LAPD to educate residents on basic precautionary security have contributed to increased crime control.

USC Olympians, stakeholders  and experts reflected on the London Olympic Games’ impact on participants and diplomacy during the panel discussion “Sports Diplomacy and the 2012 London Olympics” Thursday afternoon. The event was hosted by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy and the British Consulate-General in Los Angeles at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

Panel participants included Dame Barbara Hay, the British Consul-General in Los Angeles; Barry Sanders, chairman of the Southern California committee for the Olympic Games; Flóra Bolonyai, an Olympian who competed with the Hungarian National Water Polo Team; James Clark, an Olympian and member of the Australian National Water Polo Team; and Stina Gardell, an Olympic swimmer for Sweden who competed in both the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley. The panel was moderated by Philip Seib, director of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy.
Hay began by listing some of London’s public diplomacy goals when it hosted the Olympic Games this year. One goal was “re-generating a part of East London that had basically been a bomb site during [World War II],” Hay said.
London constructed the largest new park in the city since World War II, according to Hay.
Hay said that in addition to building up East London, the London Games provided the U.K. with an opportunity to promote its ecological goals.
“We wanted to apply the most … efficient, eco-friendly innovations,” Hay said. “Ninety percent of the derelict land on which we built the Olympic Stadium [and] Olympic Park was cleaned up and re-used.”
London also stressed the importance of participation in the games from both genders, according to Hay.
“The participation of women was immensely important to us [and] every single team had women athletes in it … which was groundbreaking for the women in those countries who’d never been able to compete,” Hay said.
Some panelists, however, said  the athletes at the Olympics are more focused on their contests.
“In the heat of the moment you’re only thinking about one thing and that’s competition,” Clark said.
Though the games are primarily a competition, the panel members were conscious of the Olympics’ symbolic significance. One member of the audience asked if national rivalry plays a part in the tenacity of the team’s play.
“Sportsmanship overrides anything else that’s going on [politically] in the world at that time,” Clark said.
Some students said the discussion illuminated how personal the Olympic Games can be for athletes. Kia Hays, a graduate student studying public diplomacy who attended this year’s games, found the discussion very informative.
“I did not even know race-walking was a sport,” Hays said.
Other students believe that regardless of the amazing variety of sports, one of the greatest strengths about the competition is its emphasis on putting differences aside.
Shannon Haugh, a first year graduate student pursuing a masters in public diplomacy said, “It’s interesting how at the end of the day it’s not about the political side of it.”
I just want to clarify that race walking was not brought up at the panel; I mentioned it as an aside to the reporter when I was saying that the Olympics are a time when people pay attention/get excited about sports they don’t typically follow (such as race walking, which I watched when I went to the Olympics-and even though I had had no previous knowledge of the sport I got caught up in the moment of it!).
Aside from that, this was a great panel discussion and I am thrilled that CPD hosted it and that the Daily Trojan reported on it :).

Three different bands performed at noon at Tommy Trojan from Tuesday through Thursday as part of a concert series dubbed Launchfest. The event culminates in a larger mystery concert  Friday.
All artists performed Christian music, as the shows were put together by the United House of Prayer, an underground Christian student organization on campus known for its worship gatherings.

Organizers said the purpose of Launchfest is to bring Christianity — and more generally, a love of God — to others through music.
Jackie Son, a junior majoring in communication and a member of UHOP, led the event. She explained that several different student organizations came together to launch the event.
“We just had the idea that music brings people together because music is such a huge part of everybody’s life,” Son said. “We just want to impact the USC community in a good, powerful way with music.”
The team of six young adults, who are unaffiliated with USC, aims to bring different Christian artists to various campuses, with UCLA next on the list.
Nick Brennt, a member of the Launchfest team, explained the religious background of the event is a crucial facet.
“The biggest thing we’re trying to communicate with the music festival … is that when kids would think of God, whether they believe in God or not, is that ‘God loves me, He’s not angry … He’s actually full of love and enjoys having fun and wants everyone to be happy,” Brennt said.
The bands who played at Launchfest were mostly found through friends of friends, according to organizers. The bands’ names were not released until the time of the performance in order to build anticipation.
Though the featured bands had similar missions, they all had different sounds: Tuesday’s Charles Jones showed off his soulful, gospel voice, Wednesday’s J. Thoven provided a more laid back, indie-folk vibe and Thursday’s The F M L Y B N D introduced a newer, more electronic sound.
“We’re all Christian dudes playing to non-Christian people, and trying to win them to Christ just through being human … and I think [college students] are the market that we have to be reaching out to,” said Jake Pappas, a band member of J. Thoven.
Though the Christian mission behind the event was not heavily publicized, the shows garnered wide support on campus. The feedback was mostly positive. More than 1,000 people RSVPed on the Facebook event and the crowd size at Tommy Trojan reached 400 people in midday heat for the individual artists.
“This definitely breaks down the barrier of what people think of when they think about Christian music; you [usually] think of something kind of cheesy, but this is very relevant,” said Megan Mullis, a senior majoring in business administration. Launchfest’s last and largest concert will take place Friday at 7:30 p.m. on McCarthy Quad and will feature a performance from a mystery guest. Short clips of previous performances can be found on YouTube.
UHOP intends to set more frequent, smaller showcases similar to Launchfest to continue spreading its message.
Hey doubtingtrojan, 
That is a great question!  ! I appreciate your response and would like to take a moment to respond to it. 
As I sit here and think about my response to your question (which, I would like to add, is a GREAT thing for ALL Christians to do), three responses come to mind. Admittedly, there are a countless number of alternatives which I have not yet considered, but these three seem particularly poignant. 
As you have walked to campus, perhaps on your way to a morning class, have you ever been stopped and asked to sign a petition? Perhaps it was PETA, urging your abandonment of the relatively incomprehensible practice of store-bought egg consumption? Or maybe you were approached by a representative from MADS, urging you to sign a petition for harsher drunk driving punishments? Though these encroachments of our personal bubble’s can be quite unnerving and even slightly obnoxious (cough cough, Cal-pirg…) it seems wise to ask the question, why have these apologists committed themselves to such endeavor in the first place? Why would they freely and joyfully donate their time, enduring the grievous Los Angeles sun, only to be rejected time and time again? Doubtingtrojan, it is because they believe in it. They believe with a belief that says, “through this experience, my life has been forever changed for the better.” The believe with a belief that surpasses transient knowledge and motivates them to action. They encroach upon our comfortable boundaries because something, or perhaps someone, once encroached upon their personal boundaries, increasing the measure of their joy and conviction infinitely. 
Throughout history, a great many ideas about Christianity have been espoused. From the awestruck “Miracle Crusades” of Benny Hinn to the eloquent writings of C.S. Lewis, ideas of or pertaining to Christianity have spread like wildfire. The problem is that not all of these ideas are strictly accurate. For example, there is a particular group of individuals in Topeka, Kansas who collectively identify themselves as the “Westboro Baptist Church” (though admittedly, I would not consider them a church at all). These individuals are infamous for protesting military funerals and holocaust museums stating, “God hates the Jews!” This is one (of the countless examples) in which a small group of dissenting individuals have led society astray. Evangelical Christians, of whom I include myself, are determined to set the record straight. 
In my last response to your question (things always seem more convincing in groups of three..), I would also like to respond to the second half of your statement  —– “Please share it with me and I will respect it. But trying to win me over? Stop right there. Your Lord wants you to live by principle and not peddle religion.” —- In Jesus’s final words before departing from the disciples He most beautifully stated “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” This Great Commission, the final words of my Lord, the very last thing He said before departing to heaven, al final de la exposición!!, states quite plainly that teaching and convincing is precisely the job which Christ has entrusted to his people. I am committed to advocating for truth because He has asked me to do it. 
My last word for you (we will call this 3b), is what I consider to be the greatest evidence for the validity of Christian evangelism. It is the fact that Jesus lived it. Jesus, the man whom I whole-heartedly believe to be God incarnate, came to earth and gave His life by  being hung to a cross to save the worst of all sinners,…me. I, completely undeservingly have been forgiven for the incalculable wrong that I have done, and am each day made new because of what Jesus did. This is a truth I will not contain.
preach it, brotha!
Agreed with Dan above. But my problem still stands: why do Christians feel the need to spread the word of the Lord to everyone? Why do they feel the urge to “win” non-Christians over, as so phrased by Jake Pappas above?  If your religion and faith is truly so compelling and powerful, wouldn’t I naturally feel gravitated towards it and want to become a part of it myself without any coaxing or need for convincing? 
This is my issue with many of the Christian groups around trying to send the message of the love and kindness of the Lord. Please share it with me and I will respect it. But trying to win me over? Stop right there. Your Lord wants you live by principle and not peddle religion.
Love This!! Great Work!!
I love your comment Dan and agree with your opinion on the delivery of the message. This has also been a proven “Fact” that it is more effective to ALL.
As an atheist, I find this much more constructive than throwing a bible at me.

Faculty and students at the USC Keck School of Medicine and the USC Ostrow School of Dentistry partnered with volunteers to staff a free health clinic held Thursday through Sunday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Each year, the clinic provides medical, dental and vision services at no charge over four days for thousands of underinsured people from across Southern California.
Wellness · Care Harbor LA opened a free medical clinic Thursday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Volunteers gave out 4,800 wristbands to patients hoping to receive care at the event. – Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
Staffed entirely by about 3,250 volunteers, the clinic is hosted by Care Harbor, a non-profit, Los Angeles-based organization dedicated to providing care for the nearly 2.5 million underinsured residents.
Last year, the clinic served some 3,000 people. Now in its fourth year of operation, the clinic aims to expand to reach even more patients.
Hopeful L.A. residents lined up for hours — even days in some cases — to wait for one of the 4,800 wristbands handed out Monday that guaranteed them an appointment at this weekend’s clinic.
Sonja Partner was one of the lucky patients who received a wristband after she waited for 18 hours.
“I went to a dentist two months ago and he charged me $4,000,” Partner said as she waited in line for a prosthetic dental treatment at the clinic. “I just can’t afford that.”
Michael Cousineau, a research associate professor of preventive medicine at Keck, said that the need for dental care at this clinic has increased, even over last year.
“A lot of people have health insurance but don’t have dental coverage,” Cousineau said. “They put off dental care until things get very bad and then they come to these clinics.”
In order to help alleviate the problem, students from the USC Ostrow School of Dentistry packed up their mobile clinic — a specialized RV with surgical chairs and dental supplies, and set up at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Not only does the mobile clinic provide free extractions, fillings and root canals for needy patients, it also helps USC dental students gain clinical experience.
Sumeet Srivastava, a fourth-year student at Ostrow, is one of about 20 students volunteering at the clinic.
“The greatest part about doing this is that the patients can walk away pain-free,” Srivastava said. “They are always very thankful.”
Glenn Ault, an associate dean at Keck, coordinated USC’s effort to help at the clinic this year and last.
“USC and the Keck School of Medicine have long been associated with the mission of caring for indigent and underserved people because our affiliation with the L.A. County/USC Medical Center,” Ault said. “We have long had that tradition. It’s in our blood.”
Ault has organized more than 100 Keck faculty and medical students to volunteer. While faculty specialists in fields like gynecology, optometry and pediatrics are directly providing services for patients, Keck students are taking vital signs and assisting the physicians at the clinic.
Laila Muderspach is the chair of Keck’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In her second year volunteering at the clinic, Muderspach is conducting routine pap smears and administering medications for urinary tract infections, among other services.
“Most of the people who come through here fall into the gaps between the ages that qualify for health care,” Muderspach explained.
Some patients have an even harder battle; Thursday, she treated an unemployed mother of a two-year-old child.
“It was really touching to see someone like that who has made the choice for herself and for her family to take control of her health,” Muderspach said.
Care Harbor does not only provide free health services at the clinic itself — it also works to ensure that the patients who pass through the clinic are set up with adequate follow-up care.
Though the free clinic temporarily alleviates some of the strain on underinsured residents, it barely scratches the surface of Los Angeles’ widespread health concerns.
“More than 2 million L.A. residents are underinsured, and we estimate that 700,000 of those are children,” Cousineu said. “That’s one of the highest rates of underinsured people in the nation. That puts a huge burden on the community as there are a large number of people who don’t have access to care.”
Cousineau said that the situation will improve as more components of the recent Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, takes effect within the next few years. He insists that a solution to Los Angeles’ major health concerns requires ensuring access to neighborhood health care services and expanding the work force for primary care.
Ault is hopeful that the clinic will do much good for the lucky 4,800 patients who got wristbands.
“This is an opportunity to provide people with much-needed care and to get them into a healthcare program they qualify for,” Ault said. “It was amazing to see the thousands of people last year who came through the clinic — we were able to help those people get the care they needed.”
And thank you for the article, Adrienne. These are our neighbors, and it is encouraging to see Trojans volunteering to help see to their well-being.
Fight on, indeed.

If there were a crown for the godfather of modern geekdom, Joss Whedon would take the throne.
Considering Whedon’s a third-generation television writer, it’s fair to say the native New Yorker has storytelling in his blood. But after moving to Los Angeles and spending a few years working for the show Roseanne, Whedon really got a chance to prove himself by creating a series of his own. Based on an original script he’d written for the movie of the same title, Buffy the Vampire Slayer got picked up by the WB as a mid-season replacement in 1997. The rest is cult television history.
The story of a teenage girl destined to fight against the forces of evil, Buffy was a big hit for the station. Thanks to Whedon’s unique brand of dialogue and penchant for creating beloved characters — especially powerful females — it wasn’t long before critics and audiences alike latched onto the show. Buffy didn’t necessarily have the biggest fan base, but the 5 million or so viewers who tuned in were some of the most dedicated around — an early sign of the kinds of followings Whedon would gather with almost everything he did.
Buffy’s success would result in the nearly-as-popular spin-off show Angel, as well as comic book continuations for both series after they completed their season runs.
With two successful series under his belt, Whedon then moved on to create his dream show, Firefly, a sci-fi western about the crew of the spaceship Serenity. Sadly, the show wasn’t compatible with its station, FOX. FOX misrepresented Firefly in advertising, moved its time slot, cut off its broadcast in favor of  sporting events and aired episodes in an incorrect order. After only 11 of the 14 produced episodes made it to air, the show was cancelled.
In any other case, that would have been the end of the story. But Firefly was something special. After its DVD release, the show developed a deeply devoted cult following that came to be known as the “browncoats” after the freedom-fighting rebels that the main character of the show fought for. The fans petitioned endlessly for some form of Firefly revival, and against all odds, the “browncoats” received it in the form of theatrically released Serenity, a continuation of the series written and directed by Whedon.
Despite Whedon’s creative influences, a show that gets cancelled after less than one season doesn’t get made into a movie without an unprecedented level of dedication from fans. And though Serenity was a failure at the box office, its mere existence was enough to show how powerful a small, passionate group of fans can be. In fact, they’re still going strong and just celebrated Firefly’s 10th anniversary with a TV reunion special. It’s easy to see why the browncoats have taken up the slogan of one of Serenity’s characters: “Never stop the signal.”
As painful as it was to lose what might have been his favorite creation, Whedon moved on again. During the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike, Whedon worked with friends in front of and behind the camera to make Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog, a 45-minute musical starring Neil Patrick Harris as a wannabe super villain. The show was released directly to the Internet, where — to no surprise — it became something of a phenomenon, with a sequel now in the works.
Making cult hits is just what Whedon does. Almost 15 years after Buffy, there is still a clear division between those who love Whedon and those who have never been exposed to his work. Still, when Robert Downey Jr. put on a red and gold suit, everything changed.
With the success of Iron Man, the newly formed Marvel Studios moved forward with its plans to create a crossover movie starring all its heroes and chose Whedon to direct the pivotal blockbuster The Avengers — a rather bold decision. No matter how skillfully Whedon proved he could handle a superhero team with his work on the Astonishing X-Men comic book series in 2004, this was a gamble, but, of course, it more than paid off. Marvel’s The Avengers was the third highest grossing movie of all time, propelling Whedon to the top of the list of the most powerful mainstream directors. After the record-breaking opening weekend, Whedon released a letter to longtime fans, thanking them for their dedication over the years and expressing excitement about the future.
In the wake of his latest and greatest triumph, Whedon signed a deal with Marvel to mastermind its next phase of production. Not only will he write and direct the sequel to Avengers, he’ll oversee all of the installments leading up to the final film and produce a television show set in the same world.
With both a tight-knit cult following and an A-list platform to work from, Whedon might just be the most fortunate creator working today. The signal’s not stopping anytime soon.

Firefly is the greatest TV show of all time.  Thanks from a Browncoat.
Seeing Summer in the fight scenes in Serenity made me think that despite how pretty she is, she is such a gutsy performer who just throws herself completely into her character. She is not afraid to reveal all that the character has to offer, whether it is displaying her grit that she needs to run towards the Reavers, contorting herself in a physical rage as she slaughters them, and then standing in exhaustion, anger, and looking as grim as death standing over their bodies. She really convinces the audience that she is that character and that she did these things. At no point am I thinking that this is cute but I don’t believe it. She makes a complete transformation into River the Impaler and she is going to make it a really bad day to be a Reaver. And she looks fabulous doing it. 
And now if Joss Whedon could remember Summer Glau and hire her in his upcoming SHIELD tv show for ABC…
[…] Daily Trojan, with an article running every Friday in a series called “Fandomination.” Here’s a piece on Whedon, for instance. There are five or six others, so far. It’s fairly basic, informational stuff so that people […]

Writers often consider the short story the perfect art form because of its challenging limitations. But the same praise has, unfortunately, eluded the short film.

Often, short films are associated with young artists who have yet to gain the skills or attention necessary to produce a feature-length work. The restraints imposed by a shorter run time, though, often have interesting results, as is exemplified in the new collection Stars in Shorts.
Stars in Shorts, opening Friday at the Nuart Theatre in West Hollywood, is an anthology of unrelated short films with  recognizable actors in lead roles. Though Shorts is a mixed bag, there are moments that shine. And fortunately, the star power helps these shorts gain attention that would otherwise elude them.
 
The Procession
In The Procession, Lily Tomlin and Jesse Tyler Ferguson star as a mother and a son reluctantly leading a funeral procession. The short is darkly comic and features great performances from its lead actors. Tomlin and Ferguson are guilt-tripped into attending the funeral of a friend of a friend whom they’ve never met. In the middle of making a decision to ditch the ceremony to go to a restaurant, the two find themselves leading the procession to the cemetery. While they meander through the streets, they comment, often hilariously, on the bonds of family and rituals of death.
Steve
Colin Firth stars as Steve, an unbalanced man who invents excuses to interact with his young, beautiful neighbor (Keira Knightley). Steve is dissatisfied  with his life, as are Knightley’s character and her boyfriend — but at least the couple has each other. Steve serves as a commentary on the loneliness and isolation of modern urban existence, and, as a short film, it is immensely successful. Firth succeeds in his role, incorporating sympathetic, funny and unnerving emotions into his performance. Knightley is also wonderful despite an unexplained Scottish accent.
Not Your Time
Much of Not Your Time, the longest of the shorts at 25 minutes, feels extraneous. The musical stars Jason Alexander as a struggling writer-editor who plunges into misery when no one displays interest in making his passion project. The film seems to meander with little purpose, unable to find a coherent storyline amid the onscreen chaos. What’s worse: Most commentary on the publishing industry falls flat.
Sexting
Julia Stiles stars as a mistress meeting her lover’s wife for the first time in Sexting. The Neil LaBute-penned short is strong if only for Stiles’ bravura performance. The actress shines as she makes a long-winded, stumbling and awkward attempt to explain her side of the story to the woman she has wronged. It’s unfortunate, then, that the dialogue and direction feels so insincere; and the decision to film the short in black and white only adds to its artificiality.
Prodigal
Arguably the worst of the set,  Prodigal, presents a father attempting to protect his superhuman daughter from a sinister organization helmed by Kenneth Branagh. But even Branagh’s long-celebrated acting abilities cannot save the film. Prodigal gets points for ambition but is unable to contain or adequately explain the various sci-fi plot details in the allotted time. Additionally, the characters and situations are so shamelessly overwrought it becomes impossible to sympathize with any of them.
After School Special
Undoubtedly the most absurd, offensive and disturbing of the collection, After School Special features Sarah Paulson and Wes Bentley engaging in uncomfortable conversation in an indoor playground. The whole film feels like a set-up for the unexpected, darkly comic closing. But the humor of the short, also penned by LaBute, is often too unpleasant and distasteful to be either entertaining or affecting.
Friend Request Pending
Friend Request Pending, a standout featuring Dame Judi Dench, ends Stars in Shorts on a high note. Dench plays an older woman who turns to Facebook in the hope of exacting a date from a man she just met. The results are funny and heartfelt, depicting the need for connection in an increasingly disconnected society in an original way. As Dench conveys her character’s confusions about technology and her heartbreaking need for connection, you can’t help but root for her.

Though most mainstream music tends to shy away from socially relevant  issues, Lupe Fiasco proves he has the chops to tackle hardcore topics. His latest release, Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1, presents an artist who has decided to make political and societal awareness the crux of his work.
Heavy topics · Lupe Fiasco returns with Food and Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1. Though old fans will find plenty of new tracks to enjoy, Fiasco’s dull, political subject matter dominates the album. – | Photo courtesy of Atlantic Records
But though that decision illustrates the socially conscious wordsmith’s commitment to his ideals, it detracts from what used to make his music special.
Those who rightfully consider his 2006 debut, Food & Liquor, as one of the preeminent hip-hop albums of recent history will be disappointed to learn that its sequel, and Fiasco’s fourth album, is not a full return to excellence. The original F & L was a masterpiece in storytelling, most notably on the imagery-heavy classic “The Cool,” but F & L II does not retain that artistic approach. Instead, the concept of social commentary nearly dominates each of the album’s 16 tracks.
Perhaps this development makes Fiasco’s music more impactful. Unfortunately, it also makes his music much less interesting.
In the opening track “Ayesha Says,” Fiasco’s sister lays out the framework for the recurring themes of the album’s slam poetry style: “Food and liquor stores still occupy the block / while police and community watchmen justify why they shot / Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin / better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton.”
Within the first minute of F & L II, listeners realize that this album is going to be diving into some deep source material. Over the course of the album’s progression, however, Lupe’s numerous returns to the well become obvious and repetitive.
Nearly every song has serious political overtones if not overt political statements. During the hook of the Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth cover “Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),” Fiasco sings, “Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay / ‘cause freedom ain’t free, especially ‘round my way.” And the first lines of the second track of the album, “Strange Fruition,” make it clear that no punches will be pulled: “Now I can’t pledge allegiance to your flag / ‘cause I can’t find no reconciliation with your past / when there was nothing equal for my people in your math / you forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads.”
When Lupe isn’t speaking on the oppression of society, he is commenting on the woes built from within society. On the tracks “B-tch Bad” and “Audubon Ballroom,” he argues that the vocabulary of modern hip hop, namely the oft-used “b” and “n” words, cause damage to society. Ironically, Fiasco uses these terms himself from time to time throughout the album.
Still, those yearning for Fiasco to return to his roots of vibrant storytelling and vivid imagery will not be entirely disappointed. The artist remains extremely lyrical and laces his verses with metaphors and double entendres reminiscent of his debut album. “Form Follows Function” is a clear example. He spits, “Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought / now out the soup du jour for you and yours / might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw,” demonstrating there is still a hint of the artist fans have come to know and love.
Furthermore, the track “Lamborghini Angels” is a standout. Sampling a line from one of his best songs of the last five years, the mixtape track “Angels,” Lupe creates an imaginative image: “I see diamond-flooded demons, Lamborghini angels, halos down with the doors flapping when they came through.”
In describing the demons in his mind, he paints a picture of a Lamborghini with open scissor doors resembling the wings of an angel. It’s safe to say that Lupe hasn’t completely lost his touch when it comes to striking creativity. Unfortunately, high-caliber tracks like “Form Follows Function” and “Lamborghini Angels” are few and far between on F & L II.
The production is solid, but the album lacks a textural and aesthetic connection from track to track. The beats, most of which are mixed by different producers, do not flow together particularly well, and the hooks seem especially random. This isn’t a great overall album, but strong wordplay makes for some good songs that will, if nothing else, catch your attention.
Still, it’s clear that rather than trying to convince the listener to completely adopt his state of mind, Lupe Fiasco is simply attempting to force his audience to think. This album makes its listener think about life, society, the government and race relations, among other subjects. And for that reason, F & L II is worth checking out.

Last week, presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney spoke separately on the Spanish-language television channel Univision to address issues regarding the Latino community and, of course, to attempt to woo Latino voters.
Obama’s failure to follow through on plans for immigration reform during his first term was highlighted in the Univision forum. Moderator Jorge Ramos accused Obama of going back on his word, saying, “A promise is a promise and with all due respect, you didn’t keep that promise.”
Obama openly acknowledged this failed promise, thus directly damaging his re-election campaign and relationship with a key voter base that has consistently supported him since 2008. Mitt Romney, however, has not been in a position to affect change for the last four years, nor has he made unfulfilled promises.
The Univision forum will not have a huge impact on Latino voters’ opinions of Romney, whose potential for election relies on other voter demographics’ support. Obama, on the other hand, might need the support of this voting bloc now more than ever and will now have to come up with some concrete immigration policies if he is to hold onto the Latino vote.
Rewind to 2008, with Ramos again interviewing Obama, but when he was still a presidential candidate. Ramos asked if he would commit to immigration reform.
Obama’s response: “I cannot guarantee that it’s going to be in the first 100 days. But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I’m promoting and that I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.”
This bill did not happen in his first year. A major 2008 campaign promise to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants materialized in the form of the DREAM Act, but it failed to pass in the Senate. If he was truly committed to making that promise a reality, wouldn’t he have pushed harder for its passage by now?
Obama had four years to tackle immigration policy. Though there certainly have been other pertinent problems to deal with, there is no excuse for failing to deal with such an important and relevant issue when the administration assured voters on the campaign trail in 2008 that immigration reform would occur during Obama’s first term.
And he did not only fail to keep a promise to Latino voters, his administration had the highest number of deportations in any American presidency. He used bipartisanship in Congress and the rule of law as a scapegoat for the high deportation rate and his lack of action on immigration reform.
Romney’s interview — in which he discussed vague plans for a “permanent solution” to immigration and criticized Obama’s inaction concerning the issue — did little to boost his campaign. While it would have been a positive step forward for the Romney campaign if he had used the Univision interview as an opportunity to earn more clout with the Latino demographic, his campaign hasn’t faced any significant impact.
Voters can blame Romney for failing to articulate a strategy for immigration reform, but they can’t blame him for promising to pursue concrete action and not following through. That’s on Obama.
Both candidates’ Univision interviews were subpar, but it’s the current president who is under the most pressure and scrutiny to come up with a solution that speaks to Latino needs. Latino voters are predicted to come out in record numbers this election, and in 2008 they made up 9 percent of the electorate — losing their support would be a critical loss for Obama’s re-election.

In a presidential election where immigration reform remains a hot-button issue, President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney are both vying for the burgeoning Latino vote.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
In a Univision-sponsored “Meet the Candidates” forum last week, Obama was pressed by moderator Jorge Ramos about his unkept campaign promises of 2008 regarding immigration reform. Ramos even went as far as to blatantly call out the president, saying, “A promise is a promise and with all due respect, you didn’t keep that promise.”
The peak of campaign season comes with even more intense scrutiny of what Obama did and didn’t do in his first term. In light of the Univision forum and the stringent, detrimental changes that Romney would bring to immigration if elected president, it is crucial for Latino voters to look beyond the black and white of fulfilled or unfulfilled campaign goals to focus on the positive progress that Obama has made in the last four years.
Admittedly, Obama was not totally successful in bringing the sweeping immigration reform Latino voters have been waiting for. The president himself accepted defeat during the Univision interview, conceding the lack of immigration reform was his “biggest failure.” This is not calling attention to his failure, but rather having the courage, on the most-watched Spanish language television network in the country, to be honest with Latino voters — a decision that indicates a genuine commitment to this voter base.
And though he has failed to do what he promised in 2008, this is not because of a lack of effort. Obama and congressional Democrats have been attempting to push immigration legislation through since the president entered office. They have made significant strides: Obama’s Deferred Action program went into effect on Aug. 16, allowing undocumented immigrants under the age of 30 who were brought illegally to the United States before age 16 to apply for work permits and live without the fear of deportation.
Though this program was successfully enacted, Obama’s past immigration reform failures can be attributed to deep partisanship in Congress. His main immigration legislation — the DREAM Act, which would give residency to undocumented immigrants who either enlisted in the military or enrolled in higher education — was filibustered by Republicans twice and failed to pass in 2010 as a result.
Romney’s immigration policy, on the other hand, enacts reform through punishment rather than amnesty. He pledges to veto the DREAM Act and advocates for stricter hiring laws in order to push undocumented immigrants to self-deport. Romney’s harsh immigration policy will only further alienate Latino voters, and during the Univision forum, he used Obama’s failures to avoid confronting this fact. Where Obama communicated with Latino voters openly and honestly, Romney bashed and evaded instead.
Without a doubt, only small steps have been taken these last four years toward the widespread immigration reform that the United States so desperately needs. Yet Obama has clearly established that he is committed to making further progress.
In an era of political flip-flops, commitment is what will bring the nation closer to widespread immigration reform: a commitment to going beyond a temporary fix, like the Deferred Action program, to a permanent solution, such as signing the DREAM Act into law; a commitment to pushing through bipartisanship and the rule of law to find solutions for the issues that matter; and a commitment to taking a first term foundation and turning it into a second term reality.

None of our immigration policies are going to matter, if Obama returns for a second term? The only people it’s going to financially affect the taxpayers and the hundreds of billions of dollars to be extracted forcibly from their taxes. 
LOS ANGELES COUNTY – Year-end closing 2011 figures from the Department of Public Social Services reported that over $646 million in welfare and food stamp benefits were issued to illegal alien parents for their native-born children, announced Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. The $646.2 million consisted of $258 million in CalWORKs (welfare) and $388 million in Food Stamps) — a $21 million increase over the previous year. “With the $550 million for public safety and nearly $500 million for healthcare, the total cost for illegal aliens to this one County taxpayer exceeds $1.6 billion dollars a year,” said Antonovich.  “These costs do not include the hundreds of millions of dollars for education.”  Californians need to contact their Representative, specifically governor Brown and  the Liberal State assembly and demand no more illegal alien pandering, or Californian taxpayers will be taxed even more from now to doomsday.
GOD only knows the cost of illegal alien welfare in San Francisco, or come to that the rest of the state. But across the country it is rising continuously and neither political party seems concerned?
President Obama is sure to enact another blanket amnesty as Reagan did in 1986. Only chance to stave-off any of immigration policies is to vote as many TEA Party legislators into Congress as possible. God help us from the two corrupt political parties if we do not? Better also be alert for Democratic Voter fraud now until November, because ACORN is NOT dead. 
The TEA PARTY (THE PEOPLE’S) PARTY should not be defined as just white people; they are not, they are millions of Americans of every nationality and skin color. My chapter has Hispanics, Black people, Asians from every walk of life.  We are “The People “frustrated with the corruption in both parties.  The Liberal oriented mainstream media have constantly lied about the agenda of the TEA PARTY. The TEA PARTY are moderate Constitutionalists, not the hard core Marxist-Communist-Socialists entrenched amongst the Democrats who want open borders and no laws to stop illegal migrants and immigrants from thrashing the U.S. taxpayers safety net.
If you want higher taxes; higher gas prices at the pump; an archaic tax system that benefits the privileged in both parties; a ever growing federal government with rules and regulations that inhibit new business creation; and a president that is giving even more to the “freeloader” parasites that cohabit with the illegal alien invaders who are draining the state reservoirs of money.  
The 9th circuit court is run by a bunch of Liberal judges, who interpret the laws according to their plan, not to the edicts of the Constitution. If something isn’t done in the next presidency, America will be further overrun with –unfettered poverty. It’s still not a felony to cross illegally into this sovereign nation and as I see it and millions who are involved in the TEA PARTY, the laws have been ignored for years.  Why should citizens or lawful immigrants with papers have to compete with illegal aliens? I just know America is in serious trouble with a 16 trillion dollar deficit, and no real enforcement to stop more human financial encumbrances entering through our borders or jetting in from a foreign country. It’s a real catch 22 situation with the winners being businesses using cheap labor, selling more TV and household appliances, food and a whole retinue of things needed to live. They go to the bank loaded down with their dollars, but the taxpayers must foot the bills for free health care, free children’s schooling to K-12, government housing and other special programs, while citizens-residents pay the immense bill.
 I am sure about is the plan of the TEA PARTY if they can eject many Democrats and Republican incumbents and replace them? It’s already happening and by replacing incumbents in the Republican Party can politically persist that the “LEGAL WORKFORCE ACT (E-VERIFY) and the BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP LAW” finds passage and enacted to restrain more illegal alien invaders. They bring their unborn babies here, to live as parasites of the U.S. taxpayer. The children of illegal aliens had no say in coming to America, but by the enactment of the BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP BILL, this incredulous expensive issue for taxpayers is resolved.

It seemed as if the whole city was watching: The six o’clock news was flooded with interviews from people who had waited in a certain spot for hours, people updated their Facebook statuses at the speed of light and Instagram probably almost broke down due to the amount of users making their space shuttle shots look vintage in sepia.
On its way to its new home at the California Science Center Friday, the space shuttle Endeavour made its way across Los Angeles aboard a Boeing 747.
Yes, it was inspiring, but it also seemed like a copious amount of hoopla over something that actually represents a defeat for the scientific community.
Has the city of Los Angeles forgotten why the shuttle is shooting across the sky in the first place?
The Endeavour is retiring. This is the end of an era, which is the result of funding being taken away from NASA thanks to a crippling national debt.
So before people set their cover photos to that really awesome Instagram shot of the Endeavour, they should try and remember why they snapped the picture in the first place.
Were they really NASA fans: true proponents of space exploration who would have watched Endeavour launch on television if it were still in commission? Did any of them follow the progress of the Mars rover Curiosity land last month?
Chances are, the answer is no. If they were really NASA fans, they would have realized they weren’t celebrating the majestic beauty of the Endeavour, but the unjustifiable end of the era of spaceflight.
Elementary, my dear Watson. The Shuttle is going the way of government-built automobiles, to be replaced by private company-built automobiles. The Shuttle killed all of its occupants once every hundred flights or so. The next generation of spacecraft aims to give its travelers a 99.9% chance of returning safely.
And yes, I got a great shot of Endeavour flying directly overhead. I prefer to remember her in flight, not on static display in a museum.

SC and the National Broadcasting company have combined to achieve television history with the announcement yesterday that the Trojan-Notre Dame football game, Dec. 1 in Memorial Coliseum, will be televised coast-to-coast over the new microwave relay system.
The “live” telecast will be the first to emanate from Los Angeles over the permanent west-to-east transmission channel.
KNBH, channel four, will air the game locally while other viewers throughout the country will watch the famed intersectional battle over local NBC outlets.
The announcement, made jointly by Willis O. Hunter, director of Intercollegiate athletics, and officials of, Notre Dame and NBC states that the game rights have sold for sponsorship to Westinghouse Electric company.
It also mean that Coach Jess Hill’s Trojans will be viewed coast-to-coast twice during the 1951 season, the national telecast of the SC-Army game from New York, Nov. 3, having already been announced, NBC will also carry that game.
Both games will be televised as part of the National Collegiate Athletic association’s experimental television program which involves a series of “controlled telecasts.”
The coast-to-coast telecast will also open the Trojan-Irish series, which has drawn a total audience of 1,712,015 fans since its beginning in 1926, to a far greater national audience.
Under the permanent transmission system of the American Telephone and Telegraph company, the program will go from Los Angeles to San Francisco and then to Chicago by the microwave network. From Chicago it will be sent on to New York and other eastern points by the present coaxial cable connections.
Although this game will be the first sports event to go from west to east it will not be the first such program carried on the new relay. Earlier the new system will bring the world series to the east coast from the west.
