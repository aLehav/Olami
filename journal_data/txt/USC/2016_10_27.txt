The USC Viterbi School of Engineering is collaborating with several organizations to give 300 elementary and middle school students the opportunity to experience STEM at USC, learn coding and meet with Viterbi students.
The Viterbi Adopt-a-School and Adopt-a-Teacher programs will partner with the National Society of Black Engineers, Project Launch and the mentorship program Motivate and Empower. The event, titled “Closing the Gap: Technology,” will last from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Engineering Quad and will include tours of the campus. Participating schools include the 32nd Street School, 75th Street School and Willowbrook Middle School in Compton.
The goal of the event, which is the first in a series launched by Motivate and Empower, is to engage local students and spark their interest in the STEM subjects as viable and exciting fields of study.
“Closing the Gap to us means closing the gap in opportunity, achievement and resources within the local community,” said Maya Carter, founder of Motivate and Empower. “We want to engage students who may have thought the technology field was not for them. We want to show them that they can have any career that they work toward and that we will support them.”
According to Katie Mills, VAST’s K-12 STEM outreach administrator, the USC Viterbi Spotlight on Biomedical Engineering initiative will be present at the event. Professors in the biomedical engineering department will show students around USC’s labs, where they will see researchers working to find cures for cancer and examining heart cells, among other activities.
“The purpose of our Spotlight events is to show kids what cool things they can do if they stick with their math and science courses,” Mills said. “When they can sit down with people who are a few years older than them … who are doing research on cancer and heart disease, it is a way for them to build self-efficacy and their ability to see themselves as being able to do this too.”
Carter emphasized that many of the students in local schools have been historically underrepresented in the STEM fields, a fact that needs to change.
“We want every student that we work with to have the confidence and the resources they need to be successful in any career,” Carter said. “We want to make sure that we work with our local community, because a lot of the communities around USC haven’t had the opportunity to be on the cutting edge of new industries. We want to give them the opportunity to grow as a community.”
For Christin Carter, the pre-college initiative chair for the National Society of Black Engineers, the STEM subjects gave him that opportunity to grow.
When Christin Carter was in middle school, he struggled in many of his classes. His mother, upset at his grades, enrolled him in a summer program focused on getting kids engaged in STEM. During that program, he realized that he could succeed in a STEM field if he worked hard enough.
Now, he works to inspire kids from low-income communities to dream big and pursue these challenging subjects.
“They don’t tell you about engineering when you’re from a low-income neighborhood. They don’t really tell you about the fun math and science things you can do,” Christin Carter said. “We want kids to know that there are so many opportunities, not just in engineering but in STEM in general.”
Mills noted that the United States is lagging behind other countries in science and math education, and she hopes initiatives like this one will encourage students to take courses in the STEM subjects.
“American students are not keeping up with STEM studies,” Mills said. “There is an urgent need for more adults who are trained in science, technology, engineering and math. We’re trying to get kids excited and raise awareness as to why they should stick with their STEM subjects.”
According to Mills, while there are not currently enough students pursuing careers in STEM, the Los Angeles Unified School District is making an attempt to increase the number of students, especially in communities of color, who go into these fields through its Next Generation Science Standards initiative. These standards were adopted by the California State Board of Education in September 2013 and provide a new framework for K-12 science education.
“There are some really important shifts happening statewide and across the nation,” Mills said. “The new guidelines, called the Next Generation Science Standards, encourage hands-on, project-based learning that I think is going to engage students in a much better way.”
Christin Carter said that the most rewarding aspect of the program is watching kids become engrossed in learning, realizing that they too have the potential to become a researcher or scientist.
“The best part is seeing kids realize the potential they have within themselves,” Christin Carter said. “When you see them realize that they can do algebra or they can complete that science project or they actually like to make lava volcanoes — it’s a beautiful thing. There’s nothing better than seeing a child who loves education and is hungry to learn more.”

Over the next few days, the USC School of Dramatic Arts will host a series of events to start a dialogue about the divisive issues such as race, gender, culture, ethnicity and personal identity. 
This year’s Diversity and Inclusion Summit began on Thursday with a series of workshops, panel discussions and performances focused on generating conversations among students. The summit, which runs through Oct. 30, was organized by SDA Associate Professor Anita Dashiell-Sparks, and follows a similar event held last year. 
According to Jacqueline Lawton, an assistant professor in the Department of Dramatic Arts at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and one of the summit’s speakers, last year’s summit focused on trying to diversify SDA in both its admission program and academic offerings. The event, Lawton said, came as a response to students pointing out to Dean David Bridel the lack of diversity in both the student population and the courses the school taught. 
Lawton led a workshop on gender identity and how that plays on stage, as well as a workshop specifically geared toward using theater for social change. 
“My work is very specifically geared towards student identifying micro-aggressions,” Lawton said. “It can be from the lenses of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, whatever it is that causes pain or angst within them, so they can address it directly and speak about who they are.”
This year, the program is split into two different sections. One part, which took place on Thursday and will take place again Saturday and Sunday, offers a series of panels open to the entire USC community. 
These panels offer perspectives on issues that are at the cornerstone of today’s social activism, including gender politics, cultural appropriation and the importance of making sure that artistic endeavors mirror the diversity of the population. 
One panel on Thursday afternoon focused on how gender is performed on stage, using the example of the play SEVEN. 
The panel featured one of the play’s seven playwrights to discuss the creative process involved with staging a play based on current events. 
Friday’s section is reserved for SDA students and faculty, and features a variety of breakout sessions and workshops with distinguished faculty from the department as well as guest speakers from all over the country. The finale of this event is the town hall at the end of the day, in which students can address questions and concerns directly with faculty and the directors of the program. 
The program features several more speakers, including writers and producers from shows like Empire and Private Practice, during its panels on Sunday on performing race and class struggles on screen. Sunday’s events also include a panel on how identity politics affects and is represented in mass media, led by the SDA faculty.

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanSafe, not sorry · Workers at the New North Customer Service Center have been instructed to wear gloves and sanitize their hands in order to ward off against an increase in flu-like symptoms over the past few weeks.
Sophomore Connor Castilla was having a normal day until he started feeling “a bit weird.”
“After dinner, I felt a little odd, but nothing specific,” Castilla said. “After about 10 minutes of sitting around, I just got hit by a wave of awful stomach cramps. I felt really sick all of a sudden and had to run to the bathroom.”
Castilla, a business administration major and residential assistant for the second floor of New North Residential College, is one of dozens of students affected by gastroenteritis, or stomach flu, this past week. Castilla estimated that on his floor of 150 people, about 30 have developed symptoms over the past few days. The University has confirmed the diagnosis but has declined to comment on the exact number of people affected or whether the outbreak has spread to any other residence halls.
Castilla came down with the virus Wednesday night after showing no major symptoms the entire day before.
“I was just hoping it was in my head because of everything that was going around,” Castilla said.
Trevor Pohlman, a freshman majoring in business administration, lives on the second floor of College Hall within New North. He estimated that 21 people in his wing have been infected as of Wednesday night, but he believes the outbreak began several days earlier.
“Two nights ago, we were just talking in the halls, and there were people throwing up in the bathrooms,” Pohlman said. “We didn’t think anything of it.”
He became concerned, however, when his RA told him not to go in the bathroom the following morning.
“I heard five people in our bathroom on their hands and knees throwing up,” Pohlman said. “I was going to the bathroom in the morning to brush my teeth and my RA said, ‘I don’t think you want to go in there.’”
Pohlman is also aware of four other students who have been transported to the hospital due to illness. Concerned for his well-being, he chose to stay with a friend living at Webb Tower.
“I felt like a sitting duck just waiting to get [the disease],” he said.
According to a memo sent Thursday afternoon by the Engemann Student Health Center Administration, USC has experienced an increase in cases of “gastrointestinal viruses and rashes” in residence halls over the past few weeks. The memo reminded students that viruses are easily spread through person-to-person contact, touching of contaminated surfaces and consumption of contaminated foods and liquids, and urged them to wash their hands often and avoid contact with others who are infected.
The University administration has responded by adding more portable sanitizing solution stations throughout residential halls, and has asked USC Hospitality workers to replace and sanitize utensils regularly to combat the spread of the virus. Team members also have begun wearing gloves. 
Some students, however, are taking additional precautions.
“I went and took a shower at the Lyon Center and basically have been living out of my backpack,” Pohlman said. “I’ve grabbed one change of clothes because I am not going into my room and into my hallway.”
Macey Ibalio, a freshman World Bachelor in Business student, also lives on the second floor of College Hall. Though she received the advice to wash her hands frequently and carry around hand sanitizer from Engemann, her peers and her RA, she, like Pohlman, is staying with a friend.
“I avoid areas near New North and EVK and try not to touch any surfaces like doorknobs or counters with my bare hands,” Ibalio wrote to the Daily Trojan. “I am temporarily staying with a friend at a different residence hall until the situation gets a bit better, but I’m not sure how long that will take.” 
Despite the University’s efforts, Pohlman said that he is unsatisfied with the lack of communication from his residential community.
“There’s no communication from any of the RAs or administration on if it’s safe to live in my dorm,” Pohlman said. “I talked to DPS and talked to the chief deputy, and he said it’s safe to stay in my dorm. But they had cleaning crews in the bathroom and closed out the bathroom. If you go in there, you’re going to get it.”
Evan Link, an RA for the third floor of New North, has also advised his residents to take extra safety precautions.
“I’ve told them, ‘Wash your hands; don’t interact with sick people while they’re sick,’” Link said. “I made a stall specifically designated for vomiting just because I don’t want people to be using the same stall as someone who just vomited in there.”
In a memo sent to the student body on the Thursday afternoon, the University stated that it will deliver a BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce and toast) to residence halls for those choosing not to go to the dining halls.
According to Engemann, gastroenteritis symptoms typically resolve themselves after 48 hours. The University advises students concerned about missing class to contact teachers directly. However, for additional issues, they should contact Student Affairs.
The Engemann Student Health Center is still investigating the main cause of the illness outbreak.

Right on Vermont Avenue, near the hustle and bustle of USC traffic, Bird’s Nest Cafe is the neighborhood’s newest underrated gem. One would expect the cafe to be flooded with USC students and visitors, but it is surprisingly empty during lunchtime. 
The layout of the cafe is clean, and quaint with modern, bird-related décor tying into the restaurant theme. 
There’s a colorful wall painted with a white bird, with some outside seating in addition to the little tables inside. 
The breakfast menu comes with a selection of different mouthwatering options. There are sunrise tacos as well as mini pancakes that come with mixed berries. 
The lunch menu’s pineapple express & holy grail burgers are a must try. If it didn’t seem like mac and cheese on a burger would work, the holy grail makes it something people wish they thought of. The grilled pineapple on the pineapple express adds a sweet balance to the salty flavors of the burger. 
With every item served on top of newspaper-like transfer paper, the burgers also have fries and side salad options. They charge $4 extra for truffle fries. The iced green tea matcha latte is flavorful and has the perfect amount of sweetness and flavor.
The buffalo wings are jumbo sized. Even though they serve generously large portions, they can be very good leftovers. The only downside about the cafe is that the overall prices are steep. Despite the fact that the burger is delicious and filled with fresh ingredients such as jalapenos and truffle oil — $15 is a bit too high of a price. The smoothies are also $8.
Other than that, the owners are friendly and are very involved in the happiness of the customers. Bird’s Nest is the place to go — there’s an endless bout of pastries, meals and drinks to try. It’s definitely a spot to visit again and again.

As senior year is slowly coming to an end, everything seems to be slipping out of my grasp. My time left here at USC, any idea of what my post-grad plans are and my sanity all seem to be slipping. Senior year ain’t no joke. Just some typical senior anxieties you could easily guess. But another thing you may have heard about is the senior scramble. No, it’s not a fancy egg dish for old folks. Rather, it’s the phenomena of seniors finding the urgency to romantically link up and search for committed relationships just before graduating. That’s the general idea as far as I know. 
The idea of “scrambling” to find someone before graduating is crazy, especially when thinking back to the first semester of college. When first entering college, everything is new. New campus, new people, new you and most importantly … New prospects in dating! What else did you think I might be talking about? 
I remember from my freshman year that  I was really excited to meet some new people to help freshen up my life, dating life included. Just being in a new space and getting to know a bunch of cool, attractive people was heaps of fun. Dating and just making new friendships was exhilarating because there were just so many possibilities of who I could get to know next. But as a senior, this has drastically changed.
The pool for potentials has slowly evaporated away over the years, so through my senior year, as eligible older men are also disappearing, who am I left to look to?! I’m no longer able to depend on continuously meeting new people every new school year. Because 1. I have no more “First Day of School!” in my agenda and 2. Everyone’s faces around here are getting familiar. The newness and shiny appeal of USC campus and its students have slowly dimmed and it’s getting sadly dark in here. People always suggest dating apps, going out to bars or connecting with classmates. But what’s more romantic than catching the eye of a strapping young man across the way in the cinema school courtyard? Or having a kind beauty letting you cut her in the Tro Go line when you’re already late for class and just need that shot of espresso (and her phone number) for your day? Can’t I just have my Trojan romance dream come true?
What’s sadder is football game days when the campus is filled with students and alumni decked out in gear, all emitting awesome vibes of the Trojan Family. What really gets me is seeing new parents with their wee little ones, roaming around campus in their game-day gear as well. That’s all I want.
So yes, senior scramble is kind of real for some of us, because what else would be a better cherry on top of our USC experience than finding love on this campus as well? Why not make USC the greatest alma mater after its provision of life lessons, unforgettable friends and other experiences that can never leave us (a school debt I will go to the grave with)? Although dating may not seem as hopeful for some as it was in our first years here, I bid good luck to all those “scrambling” in their last few semesters. And if you are one of the lucky ones who find your future beau after reading this, don’t forget to invite me to your wedding. So for my seniors, keep scrambling and fighting on in the name of Trojan love.

The Catholic church’s favorite symbologist is back — only this time he is about as confused as everyone else trying to figure out how Jesus could have had a kid with Mary Magdalene. In Inferno, the third movie adapted from Dan Brown’s popular book series, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) wakes up in Florence, Italy, with no recollection of the previous night’s events. 
His doctor, Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), informs him that he is suffering from amnesia due to head trauma caused by a gun wound. Langdon has hardly any time to process the fact that he is in Italy and not Massachusetts before a very determined assassin comes to his hospital room, just missing her target as Langdon and Brooks escape to her apartment. The journey has just begun, though, and things get messy when Langdon checks his coat pocket and finds a biotube containing a mini projector that shows a painting of Dante’s Inferno, tampered by billionaire extremist Bertrant Zobrist, who committed suicide just days earlier.
 A quick YouTube search reveals that Zobrist extensively talked about the problem of overpopulation and a need to wipe out most of the human population. It makes sense to him, at least. A few cliche plot twists later, traveling from Florence to Venice to Istanbul, Inferno arrives at the train station of decent-but-not-great. While the story feels stale, Howard’s direction gives it a certain life that makes it worth watching. His decision to use an abundance of shaky camera work coupled with fast editing makes the two-hour movie run as quickly as Felicity Jones unrealistically does in heels. Her character was hit the hardest in terms of cliches and as a surprising disappointment, the normally delightful Jones fell flat in her performance as the child prodigy-turned-doctor. In past standout roles (such as Like Crazy or Theory of Everything) her face does more acting than anyone else in the room, but in Inferno, her face is like Dante’s: stone. 
In all fairness, she was acting opposite one of the greatest actors to ever live — Mr. Hanks. However, from the moment he wakes up, alone and confused in a hospital room, Langdon is falling behind. One of the biggest appeals of Dan Brown’s books-turned-movies is that the audience is on a quest with the brilliant Langdon, guiding the audience every step of the way with each clue he solves. In Inferno, Langdon is being dragged against his will by greedy people who want Zorbrist’s bioweapon, which just happens to be in Langdon’s possession. Signature moments where Langdon gets to show off his puzzle-solving prowess are much too few and far between. 
As a result of dumbed-down riddles, Langdon spends most of his time brooding over the one that got away: World Health Organization leader, Elizabeth (Sidse Babett Knudsen). At 47 years to Hank’s 60, Knudsen seems an appropriate match (by Hollywood’s standards) and offers some backstory into the mysterious serial bachelorhood of Langdon’s life. However, there is one silver lining to Langdon’s demotion to regretful old man: Irrfan Khan, The Life of Pi actor who deserves much more than just supporting roles. 
He delivers a wildly entertaining performance, ostensibly stealing the show as Harry Sims, head of a private security business who is deadly both in wit and murderous capabilities. Ron Howard was right to give him as much screen time as possible, for he was the life of an otherwise cookie-cutter action film. In a film series that no one has lauded as worthwhile, Howard certainly had a large task ahead of him. Nevertheless, he wastes no time in getting into the action of Inferno, hoping that the chases and near-death encounters will distract the audience from the weak script, and he almost succeeds. Almost.

This week, USC students currently living at the Da Vinci Apartments should have moved into the Element housing complex. The townhomes, a short walk from campus and the original space for which hundreds of students paid and signed a lease, still remain unoccupied and under construction.
On Oct. 21, Element leaseholders received an email notifying them that the management company, StuHo Student Housing, and the developer had shirked on yet another deadline — the third one this semester. 
Students were displaced to Da Vinci, a Downtown complex located 4.7 miles and a 15-minute drive from campus, and forced to adopt a commuter status from the “comparable alternative housing” provided by StuHo. Now, as the fall semester nears the end, it is undeniable that for these students, proximity to school is a luxury.
Among all this chaos and clamor between students and StuHo, local news and social media outcry, a third observer stood silent — our University. Instead of sitting idle to a housing situation that causes alienation, unnecessary stress and additional economic burden to students, the University must take action and facilitate a more streamlined off-campus housing process separate from Undergraduate Student Housing.
The University has a vested interest in the protection and well-being of its students. We doubt any administrator would think to contradict this statement. It is baffling, then, to imagine that the University didn’t take action — even in a peripheral way — when a company betrayed, manipulated and lied to hundreds of its students. 
This company orchestrated a convincing and creative song and dance using the University’s brand name and its trademarked logos. It targeted our students and geared its marketing to appeal accordingly. They elected to construct a new building close to campus, and thus sold apartments and signed leases before the building was ever constructed. 
Element residents were offered 20 percent back on their rent (which paid for a living space that did not exist) and a shuttle to campus, which, like all of StuHo’s promises and projects, quickly deteriorated. With pick-up and drop-off times that ended abruptly at 10:30 p.m., the service left those in student organizations, on-campus jobs and intramural sports to find their own way home. Students quickly found that 20 percent refund to be supplanted by Uber and Lyft charges. The company begrudgingly allowed students to potentially break their contracts — with a mere seven days to find a new place to live. 
It’s also impossible to ignore the hundreds of students who  signed leases with StuHo and returned from the summer to find that their supposedly new, furnished and certainly expensive housing was nothing more than a threadbare skeleton, without so much as electricity or running water. This is obviously a problem that supersedes the capabilities of students and requires the attention of the University, whose influence around the University Park Campus area is undeniable.
The race to secure housing every year is taxing and often requires much forethought. Even with extensive planning, housing plans fall through — and that’s due in large part to the convoluted system currently in place.
A brief survey of the StuHo website advertising to the USC population will reveal just how arcane their listings are. Prices are obscured and testimonials from former tenants are absent — all standard components that promote trust in a potential landlord. It is clear, however, that with incessant complaints from students over the years, the company has yet to change their ways. Thus, to remedy the situation, the University must intervene and design a system that installs transparency.
First, the University should endorse management companies and housing listings that meet the needs of the students. This would include legal conduct, fair pricing and guaranteed function of all assured amenities. 
Additionally, there should be a University-operated portal in which management companies and housing listings that have met USC’s assessment are posted. Students should have an easier time parsing through information vital to their well-being. A portal could enable a mentality in which management companies would have to elevate their standards to meet the University’s, and therefore the students’ seal of approval instead of shrouding unappealing parts of their operation in mystery. 
Currently, however, residents of Element are caught between two unideal housing options because the building they were promised is still unfinished. So, with both StuHo as well as the University, we have unfinished business.

Proposition 58 is one of the most important education initiatives on this election cycle’s ballot. It would allow school districts to create dual immersion programs. Proposition 58 would replace Proposition 227, which currently mandates that English is the only language allowed to be used in classrooms, besides foreign language courses. Proposition 227 required English Language Learning students to transition to mainstream English classes within one year. Given that multiple applied linguistics studies suggest that it takes approximately six years for students to attain academic language at a high enough level to be successful in classes, transitioning English Language Learners to a mainstream English class within only one year woefully fails to prepare them for success. While Proposition 227 does not make it illegal to attend a bilingual school, such schools have to jump through multiple hoops in order to gain the funding necessary to operate. Though about one in four students in California speak a language other than English in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, very few alternative language programs exist in California. Proposition 58 would replace Proposition 227, and allow schools and communities to decide what kind of language program their students should participate in. Thus, a vote yes on Proposition 58 is a necessary step toward allowing students to reap the benefits of enrolling in a dual language immersion program.
Under the current system dictated by Proposition 227, English Language Learners perform worse on standardized tests than native English speakers, which demonstrates how our current English language acquisition classes for non-native English speakers is failing to prepare these students accurately. However, research has shown that dual language immersion students outperform native language students on standardized exams, irrespective of the dominant and nondominant language. In other words, regardless of a student’s age, socioeconomic status or ethnicity, a student whose native language is English, but is in a dual language program to study Spanish, will succeed on par, or better, on reading and math exams than students who only speak English. Moreover, dual immersion programs that enable students to learn their home language while they learn English enhance language acquisition skills of both languages. Studies have proven that students are able to achieve greater fluency in both languages because second-language proficiency enables students to develop higher levels of thinking related to how various parts of language function. Bilingual children also develop key problem-solving abilities at a younger age than their counterparts who only speak one language.
At a time when the economy is becoming increasingly globalized, being bilingual affords students greater opportunities to be successful in the marketplace. English Language Learners do not reach the same levels of achievement in English-Language Arts or math as their native English-speaking peers, even if the English-Language Learners had reached a level of proficiency to be moved into mainstream English classes. This startling statistic not only shows the shortcomings of current English Language classes, but also illustrates how high the achievement gap is for students of nondominant versus dominant language practices. Proposition 227 forces students to learn a new language while ignoring the language skills they have already acquired through their first language. Bilingual education helps close the achievement gap by utilizing the language skills students have already learned through their home language and applying it to the second language acquisition.
Current English-only teaching largely ignores the cognitive and social benefits of being able to speak multiple languages. Proposition 227 is problematic because if students are told that their home language is incorrect and secondary, it puts a negative affective stance on that language, and students can develop a negative feeling toward it. Moreover, Proposition 227 puts non-English speaking students behind because they do not speak English, though they may be ahead of the curriculum without the language barrier. Proposition 58 has the ability to create greater educational opportunities for students who were previously held back because their native language was not English, while also encouraging students to develop language proficiency in two languages through dual immersion programs, which have been shown to increase a student’s overall language and cognitive skill acquisition.

The USC Environmental Student Assembly hosted an event last night called “Sacred Earth,” which analyzed ways in which religion and environment are intertwined and how religion can help solve climate change.
Lena Altaffer | Daily TrojanEnvironmental importance · Jeremy Kagan, a professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, spoke about the sanctity of life in the Jewish faith.
The panel included Victoria Petryshyn, a lecturer in geobiology at USC; Ignacio Castuera, a United Methodist minister; Jeremy Kagan, a professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts; Asma Mahdi, communications and public relations manager at the UCLA Sustainable LA Grand Challenge; and Mugdha Yeolekar, Postdoctoral Faculty Fellow in Theological Studies at Loyola Marymount University. The panel consisted of experts on climate change and the Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu faiths. Those who represented their faiths gave tangible examples of how their religion has advocated for the protection of the environment.
According to Yeolekar, for those who follow Hinduism, all natural things are sacred and there is a connection between nature and a higher power. Yeolekar quoted a passage from a Hindu religious text, in saying that “one tree is equal to 10 suns,” illustrating the value placed on life and the importance of non-violence toward all living creatures. This value stems from the fact that the environment and humans share the same space on Earth.
“We are sharing the environment in a participatory model of religion,” Yeolekar said.
There are many historical examples in which the value of the Earth has prompted Hindus to act for the good of the environment, Yeolekar said.
In Hindu culture, whenever food is received, it is a gift from a higher power that should be repaid, often by planting saplings. For example, in the 1980s, Hindus started a movement to hug trees to prevent them from being cut down, calling them their “children.”
The Torah, the central text in Judaism, advocates for much of the same divine relationship between humans and their environment as in Hinduism. Kagan said that in Judaism all things are held sacred, and thus everything on the Earth should be protected by humans.
“If you do harm to the Earth, you are doing harm to the God that created you and Earth,” Kagan said. “Everything here, including your life, is alone from God and you are responsible to be a shepherd.”
Even though the Torah advocates respecting the environment and participating in rituals that close the gap between humans and nature, Kagan said the majority of Jews do not practice those principles.
Castuera, who represented the Catholic faith, admitted that Catholic leaders and institutions have historically been the biggest culprits of environmental degradation and the exploitation of indigenous people.
“We had the false sense that the Earth was going to be there forever and we can exploit it,” Castuera said. “Historically, Christianity has been the creator of the image that we can keep on exploiting this earth.”
Even with the negative images associated with Catholic institutions, Castuera believes that there is progress to be made, and that the current dialogue by Pope Francis and similar religious leaders are helping to set the church back in the right direction.
“The element of tenderness is vital and it’s essential,” Castuera said. “The present Pope picks up also that element of tenderness.”
Mahdi says that there are 750 verses in the Quran that reference nature. In most cases, it tells readers that it is our shared responsibility to return the environment to its purest possible form.
But for Mahdi, the power of Muslims to effect change comes primarily in their numbers, and not the scripture. There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, which Mahdi is an important start. She believes that unity can help bring together comprehensive climate reform.
“We transcend every race, language and country,” Mahdi said.
That climate reform is important, as Petryshyn argued, while showing scientific evidence pointing to the dangers of climate change. She said rising carbon dioxide levels and resultant temperature increase is a cause for worry, but agreements like the 2015 Paris Climate Conference put humanity on the right track.

This week, students were able to learn about health resources available to them on campus through different events promoting health
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanWeek-long workout · Students participate in a fitness challenge on Monday, the first day of the University’s Health and Wellness Week.
y eating and fitness.
USC Health & Wellness Week, hosted by the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion and the USC Engemann Student Health Center, started on Monday and continues until Friday.
Along with attending events, students were able to talk to representatives from the health center about exercise techniques and healthier dining hall choices. With two days remaining, there are still events to participate in.
Throughout the week, representatives from the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion have visited different residential colleges to speak to students about healthier eating choices and to give away free organic foods.
Students can visit Parkside International Residential College, Fluor Tower, New North and Pardee Tower through Thursday to receive tips about healthy living at nutrition tables.
Finally, Professor Beauregard Tirebiter, USC’s new full-time health and wellness dog, is available this week to help promote stress relief and mindfulness.
Valeria Resendiz, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, had the opportunity to talk to representatives at Parkside IRC about healthier eating choices and received free organic foods.
“I like that they were offering organic food,” Resendiz said. “It was a good and healthy change from regular dining hall food. I [also] think that it’s really cool that they are offering free yoga and pilates classes to try new opportunities on campus since I have always wanted to attend one.”
Students also have the opportunity to represent USC by logging their active minutes in the Pac-12 Fitness Challenge to compete with other colleges participating. Thoughtful Thursday and Fit-for-Life Friday are the remaining fitness events taking place at the Lyon Center this week, as well as free Zumba, cycling, hip-hop cardio and pilates classes.
Students can attend the events and log in their minutes or participate by walking to class, practicing meditation, eating a healthy meal, or working out on their own.
Bipin Kishore, a facility supervisor at the Lyon Center, said that the Student Affairs website has a feature that allows students to log their fitness hours during Health and Wellness Week.
“Health and Wellness Week goes on at a lot of colleges … as a friendly competition,” Kishore said. “We have free membership for staff [at the Lyon Center] for one week, and they get fitness classes for free.”
Sandy Andres, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, attended one of the free Zumba classes offered during the week.
“It was great being able to talk to some of the people from the Health Center and learn about some of the free classes at the Lyon Center,” Andres said. “It was so much fun, and especially during midterms. It’s nice to be able to have fun and be healthy at the same time.”
The Office for Wellness and Health Promotion is a drop-in hub for student health and wellness resources on campus. Their office is located on the second floor of the Engemann Student Health Center. USC students can visit the office during their business hours to grab free food, band aids or condoms.

The Forum was filled Wednesday night with attendees waiting for the U.S. National Security Challenges and Opportunities discussion to begin.
The two panelists — retired Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff — were ready to tackle the most pressing policy challenges awaiting the next U.S. president. The moderator, Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, presented the two panelists with a series of lightning-round questions. They were advised to answer within a minute.
In the first question, they discussed the Battle for Mosul, the operation to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from ISIS. Petraeus suggested that the army will eventually take back the city, but it will be a question of time. Schiff agreed and pointed out that there are “three dimensions” of challenges facing the United States in the region: ideological, political and military. Militarily, he believes that the Iraqis will regain their city with U.S. support, but the other two dimensions will pose more of an issue.
The panelists also spoke about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goals in the Middle East. Schiff explained that Putin wants to preserve Russian military presence in Syria so it can be a world-stage player again. Putin, according to Schiff, views relations with the United States as a zero-sum game — every U.S. win is a Russian loss. He also pointed out that the region must primarily transition away from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by having leverage over Russia, which the United States doesn’t have yet, and Petraeus agreed.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanSecuring the future · Former Gen. David Petraeus spoke about the continued U.S. presence in the Middle East at Wednesday’s talk.
“No successful diplomacy will be possible without a shift in the military context,” Petraeus said.
He suggested the possibility of using technology, like no-fly zones or anti-aircraft missiles, that he said would safeguard against Russia.
Schiff then brought up the issue of North Korea and how to deal with its nuclear programs. He explained that, despite huge sanctions in place, China is providing North Korea with an economic lifeline. What China doesn’t want, Schiff said, is U.S. military buildup in Asia, which is the approach the United States should take if China doesn’t stop its support for North Korea. Petraeus agreed with this viewpoint, maintaining that it’s not in China’s best desires to continue supporting North Korea.
China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, however, prompted more complex and diplomatic responses from both panelists.
“Revolutionary powers, [such as] North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China are not satisfied with the status quo,” Petraeus said.
However, no hawkish statements should be made, he argued, since the United States and China are close trading partners. Schiff echoed the sentiment, but said that the United States should continue freedom of navigation exercises to show that it does not accept China’s claims.
Schnur then directed the conversation toward the question of whether the United States should further entrench itself in the Yemeni civil war. Although both hoped for a cease-fire, Schiff argued against intervention, while Petraeus argued that the United States should issue more backing for the Saudis against the Houthi separatists.
The talk then shifted to Iran and the nuclear deal. Petraeus affirmed that the deal has some short-term benefits, but should be taken a step further by saying that Iran will never be allowed to expand its weapons as a consequence of the country’s “malign activity.” Schiff explained that there are two parts to developing a bomb: the mechanism and the industrial enrichment. He pointed out that Iran can “cheat” the deal by working on developing the mechanisms of the bomb.
Regarding the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, both panelists agreed that troops will need to remain longer, because of the region’s instability. Petraeus said that there are two components required to fund the troops: blood and treasure. The United States needs to find a long-term strategy to minimize both if it is going to stay in the region, Petraeus said.
Speaking about Benghazi and its role in the presidential election, both panelists lamented the lives lost and argued that the American deaths were the responsibility of terrorists. Schiff lamented how the topic of Benghazi was being turned into “a political circus” in the election, disrespecting the lives lost.

Mila Rosenthal, the director of communications for the United Nations Development Programme, sat down with faculty and students to discuss the UNDP’s communications campaign to promote the UN Sustainable Development Goals at Wallis Annenberg Hall at noon on Wednesday.
Photo courtesy of the Center for Public DiplomacyForward thinking · Mila Rosenthal of the United Nations Development Programme said that communication can help countries expand services.
The SDGs are a set of 17 goals — and 169 targets — aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for the global population. The goals were decided upon by more than 150 world leaders at the UN Sustainable Development Summit on Sept. 25, 2015.
Rosenthal explained that the UN was careful in setting ambitious goals that would still be achievable. She noted that while enormous progress has been made in recent years in terms of poverty and hunger reduction and improving access to education, many people are under the impression that things are getting worse.
“A lot of research shows that in regards to issues related to development, people believe that there’s not much that can be done, that there aren’t solutions,” Rosenthal said.
Rosenthal attributes this to several factors, mainly the abundance of information available to people and the immediacy with which it can be accessed. Information with a negative narrative tends to discourage people. The Narrative Project, an initiative by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, found that the debate about development is broken when people know little about what progress has been made, and instead the conversation focuses on what doesn’t work or aid is seen as a good idea done badly.
Rosenthal acknowledges that the perception that sustainable development is a lost cause only makes communication more important. In order for the SDGs to be met, citizens have to be aware of the goals and be able to hold their governments accountable.
“When people know the standards their governments have agreed to meet, whether they’re legally binding or social, countries are more likely to implement those standards in policy solutions, regulations and in practice,” Rosenthal said. “This is where communications comes in. We have to make sure that people know the goals their government has signed up for, and that they can be a part of achieving these goals.”
To maximize communication efforts, the UNDP collaborates with a broad range of partners across various industries, including the entertainment and telecommunications industries. One such partner is Project Everyone, an organization founded by British filmmaker Richard Curtis. It informs the public about the SDGs through short films. One of the most famous short films is called “‘We The People’ for The Global Goals,” and featured numerous celebrities outlining the SDGs. The UNDP also runs events to connect people through social media; one of these events is the Social Good Summit, a two-day summit examining the impact of new media on social good initiatives. The UNDP localizes more broad campaigns for different locations by translating information into the relevant language and finding spokespersons who would appeal to the demographic of that location’s people.
Patti Riley, an associate professor of communication at USC, believes that the UNDP is working hard and has a good foundation for communications. However, she thinks that they should amplify their digital presence to appeal to the younger generation.
“There’s not much space for engagement,” Riley said. “[The UNDP does not] have user-generated content thus far. You get a sense that experts are working on this issue, but you don’t have facilities for young people to experience these issues through their own media.”
Bianca Vekima, a senior majoring in global health, said it’s important for young people to understand the SDGs.
“These goals affect our lives,” Vekima said. “Mila said that the only way the government will take these goals seriously is if people know about them, and that includes young people.”

When Alejandra Guerrero was convicted of murdering USC graduate student Xinran Ji on Oct. 13, the ruling helped to provide closure to a family that had endured two years of legal proceedings.
Photo from LinkedInA global impact · Xinran Ji, a graduate student from China, was killed near campus in 2014. One person has been convicted of his murder so far.
“The conviction means everything to the parents, who lost their only child,” said Rose Tsai, the attorney representing Ji’s family. “[Ji] came here to chase his American dream by studying at USC and tragically his dream was terminated, so it meant everything to the family that has suffered for two years waiting for justice.”
Ji was killed during an attempted robbery in 2014, and although Guerrero faces up to a lifetime in prison for her involvement in the killing, Ji’s death continues to affect the international student community at USC, particularly among Chinese students who think the University needs to increase safety measures.
When Yutong Gao, president of the Chinese Student and Scholars Association, learned about this incident, he reacted with a mixture of fear and sadness, especially since this was not the first time he had heard of a Chinese student being the target of violence. In 2012, Chinese graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu were fatally shot in an attempted robbery while parked outside a house one mile off USC’s campus.
Ji’s murder compounded feelings of insecurity among international students that had arisen after the deaths of Qu and Wu, and Gao said that this affected the way students and parents in China viewed the prospect of applying to USC.
“We were questioning the school system,” Gao said. “A lot of parents whose children just got accepted into USC were worried and many of them contacted us, questioning us about the school environment.”
Tony Tambascia, the executive director of the Office of International Services, noted that while Ji’s death deeply affected the USC community, the administration has increased safety precautions over time and still receives many international applicants.
“USC’s administration has been transparent about enhanced safety and security measures that have been implemented over time, always with the goal to create the safest possible environment for the university community,” Tambascia said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Enrollment of international students at USC remains very strong, with students representing over 115 different countries, and overall numbers higher than ever.”
The University did not return requests for the number of applicants USC receives annually from China.
After Ji’s death, members of the USC administration, including Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, listened to concerns expressed by Chinese students and parents regarding safety. Two weeks after the killing, the University announced that it would add extra neighborhood security ambassadors, upgrade security technologies and decrease Campus Cruiser’s wait times in an effort to increase safety on and around campus.
Although Gao acknowledged that the University does aim to protect students, he said more needs to be done.
“The school already spends a lot of money and resources to ensure a secure environment,” Gao said. “However, the main issue is the education process. Before we enter the school, we should be informed of any safety [hazards] in the surrounding areas during our orientations.”
USC announced in 2014 that it would make graduate and international student orientations mandatory and emphasize safety education at these orientations. But Tsai said that a true increase in safety would also require changing attitudes about international students. Tsai said that the defendants admitted that they targeted Ji because he was Chinese, and therefore assumed he had money on him. She explained that this sort of discrimination is unfortunate and dangerous.
“Unfortunately, there is stereotyping and discrimination against Chinese people,” Tsai said. “Ji’s family was very middle class and saved every penny to put their child through school. Ji lost his life because of this false belief.”
In honor of Ji’s memory, the USC Viterbi School of Engineering announced a scholarship — titled the Xinran Ji Memorial Scholarship — soon after his death. The award will be granted annually to a promising electrical engineering graduate student from China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.
The scholarship may not heal wounds for the almost 5,000 international students from China who call USC home. However, it aims to provide support for potential Chinese students who may now be hesitant to consider USC a safe place to study abroad.
Tsai emphasized that Ji came to the U.S. to seize his “American Dream” and that during his time at USC, he studied diligently in order to bring pride to his family and his hometown.
“Xinran worked very hard. He put work before play his entire life and it was unfortunate because he did not get to enjoy the fruits of his labor,” Tsai said. “He was the pride of [his] hometown.”
Tsai also added that Ji’s family hopes the other suspects will be brought to justice in the remaining three trials.
With condolences to the Ji family, remember this attack happened very late at night.  Students living off campus need to remember they are living in a high-crime area and can protect themselves by not being out on the street late at night.  Nothing good happens after midnight.
Hiding like rats is not the answer.  Students who live in states that allow CCW don’t have the same “easy target” status that California students have.  The criminals and thugs view USC students as rich and helpless prey.  Thank Kamala Harris and her cronies for unarming law abiding citizens and turning us into victims.
Change priorities and seek more Native American students.
