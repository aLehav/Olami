After last weekend’s successful bout with three top-ranked teams, the women’s water polo team will slow down with a single game this weekend, hosting a home game against No. 13 Hartwick on Saturday.

The Hawks are 23-5 on the season, and they’re hot off a streak of success on the road in California this past week, going 4-1 with a single 15-7 loss to No. 4 UCLA. The team’s last loss came at the hands of No. 9 Michigan, but the team has notched wins over top-ranked teams, including No. 10 Indiana and a solid 14-6 win over No. 13 San Diego State University.
To keep its home pool dominance intact, USC will need to lock down on senior Hartwick utility Zsofia Polak, who led the team last season with 92 goals and 56 assists. The Trojans have allowed only one home loss so far this season, a 3-9 heartbreaker in the final game of the Barbara Kalbus Invitational against Stanford. 
The game will come after the team finished its third sweep of the MPSF weekly awards this season. Sophomore driver Denise Mammolito picked up her first career award as MPSF Player of the Week after scoring nine goals in three games. Her breakout game came against No. 8 Princeton, when she scored 4 goals to help the team pick up a 17-4 win. 
She continued to shine against No. 6 Arizona State, when she notched a hat trick in the first half to defeat the Sun Devils in a 12-6 victory, then followed the early scoring flurry with an assist and a steal. Mammolito is now the team’s second leading scorer of the year, netting 31 goals on the season.
Freshman Paige Hauschild also starred yet again with her fifth MPSF Newcomer of the Week award so far in her rookie season. After going 11-for-11 on opening sprints, Hauschild picked up 7 goals through the Trojans’ winning weekend. Alongside Mammolito, she notched another hat trick in the team’s victory over Princeton, and recorded a goal, an assist and a steal along with four winning sprints against Arizona State. 
Hauschild rounded out the weekend with three goals, two steals and an assist over No. 8 Pacific. She leads the team on the attack with 43 goals, and is now close to becoming only the sixth freshman to ever notch 50 or more goals in their rookie season in cardinal and gold.
Action against Hartwick will kick off at noon on Saturday, as the team closes out its third-to-last weekend of MPSF play before heading into the postseason.

Last month, USC opened a physical location for its virtual food pantry in STU 422, a resource for food-insecure students. But equally important to this emergency safety net for students remains USC’s acknowledgement of food insecurity on campus and the physical manifestation of its commitment to meeting student needs.
College advice guide books often include the best packaged ramen, but the prevalence of microwavable instant noodle meals arguably stems from an epidemic of hunger on campus rather than the laziness or ineptitude of college students. Today, the state of food insecurity on college campuses poses a crisis.
In 2017, researchers Katharine M. Broton and Sara Goldrick-Rab estimated that roughly half of all college students at two-year and four-year institutions struggle with food security. Though data remains incomplete at best and nonexistent at worst at private universities, through campus programs and testimonials, we know that our campus is not immune to this growing national epidemic.
A confluence of factors both on and off campus have created a perfect storm that renders steady access to affordable and healthy food a privilege rather than the right that it is. In 2016, college prices hit an all-time high, and for the ensuing academic year, USC’s tuition rose an additional $2,006, bringing the total cost of attending this school to over $70,000. Coupled with stagnating wages  for student jobs, skyrocketing student loan interest rates and unaffordable housing, books and food, the financial burden of higher education becomes much less manageable. 
Federal and state efforts must be met with change and progress on our own campus. For one, continued and increased investment in the food pantry will expand access to options to more students and solidify its existence as a reliable resource rather than a mere stopgap emergency measure.
Second, we must engage in more discussions surrounding food waste and pricey food options, and translate these dialogues into action and progress. When construction began on USC Village, a USC press release promised “a wide range of high-quality, affordable retail” and affirmed that “student customer price points and community member custom prices points are an extremely good match.” 
With 47.3 percent of families with children in the University Park Campus area living in poverty between 2008 and 2012, 24 percent of USC students eligible for Pell Grants and nearly two-thirds of Trojans receiving some form of financial aid, Cava grainbowls, Greenleaf sandwiches and Wahlburger entrees — which all sell for over $10 — remain financially out of reach for many in our community and on our campus. And though other eateries on campus, such as Seeds Marketplace and Lemonade also cost a pretty penny, they at least offer students the option of paying with discretionary and dining dollars.
Finally, greater accessibility to SNAP food stamps will go miles in ensuring that no student goes to class or returns home hungry. Work-study students, a sizable percentage of our campus population, stand eligible for these are benefits, as are those who work at least 20 hours a week. To promote awareness and use of this government resource, UCLA students formed CalFresh at UCLA, which brings Department of Social Services representatives to campus to register students. And though USC’s Undergraduate Student Government recently unveiled a similar program, more steps must be taken to expand its availability and reach.
These efforts to expand access to food stamps must be further coupled with efforts to expand access to EBT friendly retailers who accept these benefits. For example, Oregon State University remains one of the few colleges where students can spend SNAP dollars on campus.
Together, measures such as these, though only a start, will increase accessibility and affordability of food for students in the short and long-term.
Pundits, parents, activists, administrators and students often grapple with the question of “What is the real cost of college?” But beneath the deceitful price tag of tuition lie battles with affording simple meals, among other necessities.
It’s time to usher in and continue the discussion at USC because hunger is already in our backyard and on our campus.

In 2003, Kobe Bryant was arrested after a 19-year-old hotel employee told police that he had raped her. She alleged that he had invited her into his room so she could give him a tour of the facilities, but he then kissed her, groped her, choked her when she tried to resist and then raped her. 
Bryant at first denied there was any encounter when questioned by the police, but then conceded they had sex after being told the accuser had submitted a physical exam. Bryant denied that the encounter was nonconsensual, but the investigation found that the shirt Bryant wore during the encounter was stained with the accuser’s blood. Bryant even admitted to having choked her, saying that it’s his “thing.” 
Bryant’s legal team attacked the accuser’s character rather than her evidence, citing her sexual history and alleged mental instability, and bringing up her name an unprecedented six times, which resulted in the destruction of her public reputation. 
The methods the defense employed were so inflammatory they were cited as justification for the introduction of new rape shield legislation. After the defense decimated her reputation, the accuser refused to testify, and the judge dismissed the case. The two parties settled out of court, and Bryant released an apology which included the half-confession: “I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”
The USC Marshall School of Business has decided to invite Bryant to speak at Bovard Auditorium on Monday, despite his history and the ongoing #MeToo movement which USC has claimed to support. If the school wants to demonstrate its commitment to condemning acts of sexual violence and protecting its students, it must rescind Bryant’s invitation to speak. 
The point of the #MeToo movement isn’t just to exorcise Harvey Weinstein or any individual from prominence. It is to declare sexually oppressive behavior disqualifying. Men, and in particular prominent men like Kobe Bryant, have been able to shrug off substantiated allegations of predatory and violent sexual behavior as a quirk or a piece of trivia, rarely suffering major ramifications for their abhorrent behavior. 
In many cases, such as Bryant’s, they continue to receive idolization unscathed. The #MeToo movement seeks to pry out the implicit acceptance of harassment, assault and rape from celebrity culture. It’s more than a condemnation of individuals, and it’s more than a scandal: It’s a moral awakening. 
USC can’t have it both ways. It can’t make a spectacle of turning down $5 million from Harvey Weinstein, then accept the clout of Bryant. The School of Cinematic Arts rejected Weinstein’s donation after students petitioned it. The petition, which USC endorsed, read: “We don’t need this money. What we need are some damn principles.” 
Now’s your chance USC. Show your damn principles.

Coming off a dominant showing last week at the Pac-12 South Invitational in Santa Monica, the Women of Troy (15-6) will head to Malibu on Saturday to participate in the Pepperdine Invitational.
Freshman Sammy Slater boasts a 17-2 overall record in her first season as a Trojan. Alex Zhang | Daily Trojan
After starting the season with a pedestrian 4-3 record, USC has begun to find their rhythm, winning 11 of their last 14 matches predominantly on the 1st court. One of the main reasons for the Trojans’ recent success is the emergence of freshman Tina Graudina and junior Abril Bustamante. 
In last week’s invitational, the pair swept all four of their matchups in consecutive sets and were recognized by receiving the Pac-12 Pair of the Week award. The duo was also recognized on the national level by being chosen by Volleymob.com as the national pair of the week. It’s the second time a pair from USC has received the honor, with the last time happening when Bustamante and senior Terese Cannon won the award on Feb. 27.
To kick off their contests at Zuma Beach, the Women of Troy will first square off against the upstart No. 19 St. Mary’s (10-3). Winners of eight of their last 10, the Gaels have entered the rankings for the first time this season behind their three-game win streak and an impressive win over the Cal Bears earlier in the season. While not a traditional power, St. Mary’s projected first court pair of juniors Morgan Hughes and Payton Rund have emerged as a strong duo, having posted a 10-1 record so far.
USC’s second match of the day will be a showdown against fellow Los Angeles team No. 16 Loyola Marymount (8-7). Despite their high ranking, the Lions have struggled against the nation’s best, posting a record of 1-7 against fellow ranked teams. This will be the 18th all-time matchup between the two squads, and the first since April last year when the Women of Troy won 4-1. USC is undefeated in the all-time series boasting a 17-0 record.
While head coach Anna Collier and the players have emphasized the importance of treating every opponent equally seriously all season, there’s no question what the marquee matchup of the day will be on Saturday.
In what might be the best rivalry in beach volleyball today, the No. 1 Pepperdine Waves (15-3) and the Women of Troy will square off to finish their respective days. USC will look to bounce back after dropping two early matches to the Waves, falling 3-2 once at Merle Norman Stadium and the second time in Malibu. 
Pepperdine is also the only team in the tournament that USC doesn’t have a winning record against, as the all-time series between the two powerhouses is locked even at 10 games a piece. While it’s clear that Pepperdine has an abundance of elite players, their best pair this season has been the combination of junior Skylar Caputo and freshman Alexis Filippone. The duo, who have played all of their matches together on the 4th court, boast a record of 17-1 as a pair. If USC wants to regain their title as the pinnacle of collegiate beach volleyball, it will have to begin with getting back to defeating their elite Southern California rivals such as Pepperdine.
USC will first play St. Mary’s on Saturday at 10:10 a.m. Following that match, they will square off against Loyola Marymount at 12:30 p.m. before finishing the invitational against Pepperdine at 1:40 p.m.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
Last Saturday, USC sent out a press release announcing the hiring of Eric Mobley as an assistant coach for the men’s basketball team.
It read like most press releases, with a plain quote from head coach Andy Enfield followed by a list of Mobley’s basketball experience. But at the very end, it stated: “[Mobley] and Nicol are the parents of sons Isaiah and Evan.” There is no mention of the fact that Mobley’s sons play basketball.
Talk about burying the lead.
Let’s connect the dots: Isaiah and Evan Mobley are two of the most highly touted basketball prospects in the country. 247Sports ranks Isaiah as the 31st-best prospect in the class of 2019, and Evan as the 12th-best in the class of 2020. Enfield’s contract runs through 2023, and he needs some recruiting wins after the damage that the ongoing FBI investigation has done to the program, with potentially more to come.
(Insert thinking face emoji).
To be clear, this hire is not against NCAA rules. Head coaches are free to hire assistants who have relationships with high-profile recruits, as fishy as that might sound. Enfield probably has the inside track in signing both Mobley boys, which would guarantee a top recruit in each of the next two years.
The only downside, basketball-wise, would be Mobley’s experience — or lack thereof — at the NCAA level. Mobley’s highest level of coaching has been with the AAU (a league where LaVar Ball, a well-respected basketball intellectual, serves as the head coach of the Big Ballers) for the past 11 years, most recently with the Compton Magic 16-and-under team.
Going from a 16-and-under team to a Division I college basketball program is a big jump. That’s not to say that Mobley won’t turn out to be a stellar hire. He could use his AAU connections to recruit players. And plenty of coaches have succeeded right away in the upper echelons of basketball.
But this isn’t NBA Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr sliding from the broadcast booth to coach a Warriors team loaded with future Hall of Famers. Coaching at the college level matters so much more than it does in the pros because of how raw many of the players are. Coaches play a large role in the habits they develop, the changes they make to their game, whether they improve enough to play at the next level, and more.
Plus, the optics here are not great. Mobley replaces Tony Bland, the former assistant coach who was fired last season after the FBI arrested him for his alleged involvement in an elaborate scheme to funnel money to recruits. De’Anthony Melton, one of the recruits, was held out of action this past season and left school early to declare for the NBA Draft. Taeshon Cherry, who is alleged to be the other recruit, switched his commitment from USC to Arizona State a few months ago, robbing USC of its most talented incoming freshman in a decade.   
In essence, USC is replacing Bland, a star recruiter who allegedly used illegal means to do his job, with Mobley, who offers a direct — albeit what some might call ethically questionable — line to two prized recruits.
It is very possible that Enfield is hiring Mobley because he thinks Mobley is going to be a great basketball mind, and the fact that Mobley has two sons with promising futures in basketball is a total coincidence. That was the assumption when he called Mobley an outstanding coach and a terrific person with a wealth of playing and coaching experience at a variety of levels in the press release.
But it’s more probable that Enfield is doing what Missouri head coach Cuonzo Martin did before last season, hiring Michael Porter Sr., the father of highly touted prospect Michael Porter Jr., as an assistant. To no one’s surprise, Porter Jr. signed a letter of intent with Missouri shortly thereafter.
Enfield has also used out-of-the-box recruiting tactics before. When Marvin Bagley, the No. 1 recruit in the country in 2018, visited USC last summer, Enfield not only offered Bagley a scholarship, but also extended offers to each of Bagley’s two brothers: Marcus, a high school sophomore at the time, and 7-year-old Martay. There’s even video of Enfield showing Martay the on-campus cupcake ATM and the kid buying three cupcakes.
But that wasn’t enough for the Bagley family, apparently. Marvin committed to Duke, because of course he did. The Oregonian recently reported that the Bagley family may have received direct benefits from a Nike sponsorship with an AAU team that Bagley’s father coached. Duke is also sponsored by Nike, because of course it is.
Shady recruiting tactics are pervasive in college athletics. When your job depends on winning, and that depends on bringing in top recruits, you just have to play the under-the-table game. I’m looking forward to watching Isaiah and Evan Mobley tear it up at the Galen Center in a few years.

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
Many of us are still trying to figure out what to make of Sex and the City actress and LGBTQ rights advocate Cynthia Nixon, who announced her bid for Governor of New York earlier this month. And while I’m certainly not here to endorse Nixon, a candidate sorely lacking in civil service and government experience, I will say that this week, she made an excellent point about a particularly tone-deaf decision made by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
In a press conference Monday, Nixon spoke about how a committee formed by Cuomo to debate and craft policy concerning sexual harassment solely comprises men. 
“At a time when millions of women are making their voices heard, why should we settle for sexual harassment policies that are being discussed behind closed doors without a single woman present?” she said.
No woman needs any formal policy experience to know that when we don’t have a seat at the table, more often than not, it’s because we’re on the table. Of course, considering Cuomo’s strong record on key women’s issues like reproductive rights and abortion, for which Cuomo supports public funding and universal access, I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt in terms of his intentions with the committee. 
But the sheer tastelessness in according men authority over an issue that affects essentially all women — and an issue that exists largely because of men’s disproportionate claims to positions of decision-making power, in the first place — shows the extent to which we rely on diverse representation to address innate bias and identity-based blind spots. 
Arguably even the most devoted male allies have been conditioned to understand women’s issues as tangential. They have never undergone the everyday inconveniences of changing their routes walking home to avoid spots where they know they’ll be harassed by cat-callers. And speaking of cat-callers, there’s also the everyday experience of sexual harassment on public transportation, which, on any given day, can range from annoying and uncomfortable to outright terrifying. It’s an experience young women too often find themselves shelling out the extra cash for an Uber to avoid. 
Unlike girls and women, most men have never been taught to walk in groups at night, or to swallow their pride and laugh at crude or objectifying jokes in the office in order to avoid being seen as prudish and “no fun.” 
Of course, all of the aforementioned everyday experiences of women are, more or less, the low-ball. They are relatively minute day-to-day things that add up, but by no means are they the only sexist phenomena women are often subjected to, with minimal or no platform at all for recourse. 
Consider the 2004 Access Hollywood tape, upon which President Donald Trump offhandedly described his interactions with women — actions he seemed to see no fault with: “I just start kissing them … I don’t even wait … Grab them by the p-ssy. You can do anything.” Some 20 women have described being subjected to similar behaviors by him — nonconsensual groping, kissing and fondling — which he candidly all but admitted to on the tape. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
And Trump wasn’t alone on the bus that the audio was recorded on: He was conversing with entertainment journalist Billy Bush, another relatively high-profile man. For years, Bush publicly said and presumably did nothing in response to Trump, a fellow man in a position of power and influence, after Trump had boasted about committing acts that classify as sexual assault. 
Male complicity and the skewed distribution of social capital occupied by men in nearly every industry have silenced women’s voices through intimidation or dismissiveness, presumably since the dawn of the co-ed labor force. In addition to discussing the prevalence of blatant sexual abuse, the #MeToo movement has also pointed out how powerful men with the clout to support women who suffer from abuse often opt to either look away, or actively defend powerful male abusers they are friends with.
It should speak volumes that nothing (beyond an ongoing defamation suit against Trump) has come of the many accusations leveled against Trump, corroborated not only by each other but also by his own words. In case you haven’t noticed, Trump is the President of the United States, and was elected just weeks after more than a dozen women came forward. 
Intimidation and fear of defying boys’ club-like, male-dominated institutions of power have silenced innumerable women, whose jobs, reputations and families often depend on their silence. But the issue of women not coming forward is only one part of the problem; the other is an overarching culture that marginalizes the few women who do. 
According to a February survey by nonprofit Stop Street Harassment, 81 percent of women have experienced some form of sexual harassment in the workplace. Research repeatedly shows that harassment and exploitation disproportionately affect low-wage women workers. 
It’s exceedingly difficult to imagine that women and other marginalized people’s underrepresentation across industries has nothing to do with the systemic issues of abuse, silence and lack of accountability. 
Circling back to Nixon’s Monday speech, any woman could have spotted the gaping blind spot of Cuomo’s sexual harassment committee and its exclusively male members. But Cuomo isn’t “any woman.” 
Every female candidate, politician or leader — regardless of however little or much else she brings — carries the insight of her experiences within the patriarchy, of every minor or major thing that reminds her daily that society fundamentally was not built for her success or public participation. 
Those unique experiences and the wisdom that goes hand-in-hand with them matter, and could yield critical change on every level of government. And the same could be said of this, with regard to the representation of all marginalized people.

USC comes off a demoralizing loss to No. 4 UC Irvine on Saturday, their second sweep to the Anteaters this year. The outside hitter duo of juniors Ryan Moss and Jack Wyett both had lackluster performances; Moss had nine kills while Wyett had eight. 
Pepperdine’s last game was a 3-1 win over No. 3 Hawai’i. Pepperdine junior outside hitter David Wieczorek had a season-high 20 kills on a .390 hitting percentage to complement a well-rounded effort of three aces, seven digs and four blocks. After their performance over the Rainbow Warriors, Pepperdine now enjoys a three-game win streak, all against top 15 schools.
The biggest difference in USC and Pepperdine’s games may boil down to Pepperdine’s track record of closing out victories against top opponents, unlike USC. 
USC has lost many of its sets this year. However, head coach Jeff Nygaard continues to focus on the process and finds it encouraging that the Trojans have remained competitive in most of their games. 
With senior night against UCLA Saturday, USC hopes to pull off the upset against Pepperdine tonight and gain some momentum before heading into the final weeks of the regular season and facing the Bruins.
Nygaard said that the team learned a lot about their crosstown rival when facing them the first time.
“You also get an avalanche of understanding what their capabilities are and what their tendencies are,” he said. “It becomes much more of a chess match. It puts you in a position to where if you’re able to execute the game plan.” 
The Bruins defeated the Trojans during their first season matchup in Westwood by a score of 3-0. However, Nygaard did not try to downplay the storied history USC has with UCLA. 
“Rivalries are fantastic. There’s a lot of emotions involved, there’s a lot of pride involved,” Nygaard said. “But as a volleyball player, from my perspective, I always viewed it as, my job was always to get every point possible.” 
UCLA, however, happens to be one of the toughest opponents in the country for any team, and getting every point will be challenging. With a 19-5 overall record, the Bruins have proven their ability to consistently defeat top-15 schools such as No. 4 UC Irvine, No. 13 Grand Canyon University and No. 14 Concordia University Irvine, all of whom have defeated USC this season. 
UCLA senior opposite hitter Christian Hessenauer is one of the top players in the league and leads in total points and kills this season. Along with senior outside hitters JT Hatch and Jake Arnitz, the Bruins boast a number of veteran weapons that fuel their high-powered offense. UCLA is +222, +196 and +88 in total kills, assists and aces, respectively, against its opponents this year — a recipe for success. 
For USC seniors Jon Rivera and Gert Lisha, Saturday night will be the last opportunity they have to play in front of their home crowd at the Galen Center. Rivera, a 6-foot-6 opposite hitter from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Lisha, the team’s starting setter who began his collegiate career at Lewis University in Illinois, have faced the challenge of being the only two seniors on an otherwise young and inexperienced team. 
“These guys have been with us, they’ve been fighting since day one, they’ve put in the time, they’ve put in the sweat and the tears,” Nygaard said. “USC should be proud of the members that are graduating from this season.” 
The rest of the USC squad hopes they will be able to properly respect their graduating seniors in a big way — with a win over UCLA.

The Office of Equity and Diversity has found junior Armaan Premjee responsible for charged policy violations after a nearly yearlong investigation into sexual assault charges from last April. A hearing will be held on Friday to determine sanctions.
In July, the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office decided not to continue pursuing a criminal case against Premjee after a judge ruled that Premjee would not be held to answer.
“There is no indication of any withdrawal of consent,” the judge wrote in his ruling in July. “There is a very strong indication that the alleged victim in this case was the initiator of any conduct between the defendant and the alleged victim.”
USC’s Office of Equity and Diversity began its own investigation as well.
“Despite my case being dismissed [by a criminal court] … [the OED] still went ahead and found me responsible, which is quite preposterous and very disappointing,” Premjee said.
However, USC is required to conduct its own investigation due to federal regulations. Title IX investigations are done independently of any court proceedings, according to a USC statement emailed to the Daily Trojan.
“Student disciplinary records, student conduct proceedings and outcomes are confidential to protect all parties involved,” USC’s statement said.
The woman involved in the situation, who wished to remain anonymous and will be referred to in this article as Jane Doe, said she was satisfied with the outcome of the OED investigation and that she never wished to press charges in criminal court.
“I couldn’t have possibly gave consent, but I personally feel like he shouldn’t go to jail for something like this,” she said. “I don’t want to feel guilty for something like that.”
Premjee and his attorney Harland Braun have argued that the alleged victim initiated the sexual contact, referring to a video shown in court by Braun, which showed Premjee and Doe standing outside Banditos Tacos & Tequila. Braun argued the video shows the alleged victim seemed to indicate through hand gestures her intent to pursue sexual relations with him throughout their time together.
While Braun acknowledged that the woman involved in the case was intoxicated, he says she had the intent of having sex throughout the night. Premjee said that the woman made hand gestures to her friends that indicated that she intended to have sex with Premjee.
Doe said that she did not report any incident and had not wished to press charges.
“That’s the thing that bothers me psychologically,” Doe said. “A lot of people think I was the one who forced, who wrongly accused him of something he didn’t do, when I didn’t accuse anyone of anything in the first place.”
Los Angeles Police Department officers arrested Premjee after the incident occurred in Fluor Tower in April 2017. Premjee pleaded not guilty to one count of rape by use of drugs and one count of sexual penetration with a foreign object in May.
Premjee said that he and his attorney had been speaking with Matt Boermeester, a former USC football player who also faced a Title IX investigation last year that resulted in his expulsion.
“If any unfair action is taken against me, and if USC goes above the law we would take action against the University,” Premjee said. He later said that he and Braun were considering filing a lawsuit against USC.
Premjee wrote an email to President C. L. Max Nikias claiming that Gretchen Means, the executive director of OED, had been biased against him during the investigation. Premjee claimed that Means unfairly disallowed him from having Braun as his adviser during the Title IX investigation.
During a Daily Trojan interview in November, Braun said that Means was dishonest, that she had not allowed Premjee and him to record an interview and had called Braun a physical threat to USC.
“If this b-tch is going to go forward on [the case], it just [shows] how sick she is,” Braun said in the interview. “I have a case where consent is on tape. What more does USC want?”
The University addressed Premjee’s claim that Braun was removed as his adviser.
“USC did not disallow attorney Harland Braun from serving as an adviser,” the statement from USC read. “However, due to his disruptive behavior, Mr. Braun was informed that he would need to send another lawyer from his firm or another individual of his client’s choosing to attend in-person investigation meetings. This occurred after repeated warnings that his disruptive and unprofessional behavior was violating USC policy and impeding the process.”
Now that the investigation has concluded, Premjee could face sanctions that range from counseling and community reparations to suspension and expulsion depending on the gravity of the actions that he was found responsible for, according to USC Title IX policy.

Starting Thursday, the USC School of Dramatic Arts will be presenting its rendition of the acclaimed West Side Story, a famed musical uncovering some of the most poignant themes of youth, such as lust, change, vengeance, sacrifice and, most importantly, love. Composed by the legendary Leonard Bernstein and written by Arthur Laurents, the musical originally debuted in 1957, and has been one of the most widely celebrated musicals ever since. Thursday marks the beginning of a series of 10 performances at the Bing Theatre, which will culminate in a final performance on April 8.

This production is rather significant, as it represents a collaboration between the several art departments here at USC, including the Thornton School of Music, the School of Dramatic Arts and the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance. The scale of the production represents a rather notable alliance not only on campus, but also for those in the arts community looking to expand their network.
“It’s been great to get to know different people within the arts here at USC that I wouldn’t have been able to communicate prior to working on this production,” said Lenai Wilkerson, a junior majoring in dance. Wilkerson plays Fransisca in West Side Story. “Now I have more people that I can collaborate with here at USC and in the professional world after I graduate, which is amazing.”
The show is directed by Ken Cazan, an associate professor of vocal arts & opera in Thornton. Cazan brings strong experience to West Side Story, having directed more than 160 shows throughout his career, including Thomas Morse’s Frau Schindler, Britten’s Gloriana and Handel’s Agrippina, to name a few.
The show stars Theodosia Roussos as Maria, Tim Frangos as Tony, Juan Miguel Posada Penagos as Bernardo and Natalia Leyva as Anita, as well as many other students at USC.
“Everyone has been so professional,” Wilkerson said. “We all became friends throughout the process, which is I think can be rare in all of the highly rigorous and competitive art forms that we all have chosen.”
The production is also fortunate to have the musical direction of Parmer Fuller, an adjunct assistant professor in Thornton with noted expertise in musical theatre. Fuller has spent her career conducting a variety of orchestras, one of which includes the Young Musicians Foundation Orchestra at an event honoring Leonard Bernstein, who fittingly happens to be the composer of West Side Story.
The show was staged and choreographed by Danny Pelzig, an award-winning director and choreographer who has worked on countless productions, some of which include Moisès Kaufman’s 33 Variations and the Tony Award- winning A Year With Frog and Toad, both of which appeared on Broadway.
“We have some top people in the game working with us,” Wilkerson said. “We have been aided greatly by some talented professionals among the faculty at USC.”
The production will be performed at the Bing Theatre, running from Thursday to April 8. Tickets are $10 for faculty and staff, $12 for seniors and $20 for the general public; they can be purchased at the USC Ticket Office or on the School of Dramatic Arts’ website.

Musician Mike Posner’s upcoming Amor Fati Music Academy, a one-week fellowship program, will provide an opportunity for five hand-selected, aspiring artists to learn from world-class musicians, producers and songwriters.

The artist behind the program, Posner boasts an impressive resume but credits his childhood roots for inspiring the program’s creation.
“The idea for Amor Fati originally started with my father,” Posner said. “Throughout my childhood he would bring my family to Telluride, Colo. — this magical, one-mile long town nestled in the Rocky Mountains. After he passed a little over a year ago, I felt a good way to honor him would be to work on my next album there.”
 Returning to Telluride for a creative retreat, Posner took with him many of his favorite artists, musicians and poets. Living together for two weeks, the collective “wrote together, made art together, meditated together, and hiked together” while immersed within the beauty of Telluride and their shared artistic pursuits.
 “We really became family during that trip,” Posner said. “As the days drew to a close, we realized that the only logical thing for us to do would be to share this experience with other people. Someone suggested that next time we come back, we serve as teachers and give this experience to younger musicians. Everyone’s hands immediately shot up, and they have all honored their word.”
 Assembling an impressive team of veteran musical mentors including GRiZ, James Valentine, Adam Friedman, Pete Kuzma and Vance Gilbert, the Amor Fati Music Academy will provide young musicians with an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the music industry from esteemed teachers, while also benefiting from nutrition, fitness and meditation practices.
 “There’s really no school for contemporary music,” Posner said. “You can get a grant and study classical music, or take music production classes here and there, but as for how to make a living, how to tour, and how to tour in a healthy way — there’s no schooling for that. My friends and I had to figure these things out on our own, and Amor Fati will allow us to pass down some of the things we’ve learned the hard way and some of the mistakes we’ve made to a group of young musicians. Ultimately, our goal is to make the journey easier for the next generation.”
 At a point in his career when helping others find success is more important than furthering his own success, Posner believes that mentorship is key to advancing in the music industry.
“Mentorship is the comfort of knowing you’re not in this alone,” Posner said. “I spent the first quarter of my life devoting all my energy to helping myself — it’s time I devote some of this energy toward making a difference for someone else.”
Partnered with the performance rights organization ASCAP and music distribution company Stem, Posner hopes that the Amor Fati Music Academy will serve as an important experience for five aspiring artists that lasts far longer than the program’s one-week duration.
“I’m confident that we wil provide a life-changing experience for five young musicians,” Posner said. “The job of an artist is to create the art that you personally want to exist in the world, and I want them to walk out feeling more evolved as a human being and more inspired to take after their goals. They’ll realize that these goals aren’t as far away as they initially thought they were.”

Behind the scenes, Chris Dave’s name is held in high regard by many in the music industry. He has recorded with artists like Beyoncé, Adele and Lupe Fiasco, so it’s not hard to see why that’s the case. But Dave, who is a drummer, says he’s earned more satisfaction from his wide range of experiences than any praise.
After years of playing backup drums for artists such as Beyoncé and Adele, Chris Dave has forged his own path by starting his band and going against the expectations of everyone in the music industry. Photo courtesy of Dante Marshall.
“I always liked playing all kinds of music instead of just one style,” he said. “The struggle was always people labeling you and expecting certain things from you, so I was always trying to push the boundaries of that as a drummer and a musician.”
Chris Dave first gravitated to the drumset as a child growing up attending his church in Houston, as a way to get involved and to please his parents without having to sing in the choir. 
He  began his professional career when he linked with the R&B group Mint Condition in 1993. He climbed his way through the ranks while earning a number of impressive credits with big-name artists in every genre.
Now, however, Chris Dave’s name is appearing at the forefront rather than in the credits, thanks to his group called Chris Dave and the Drumhedz. The collective released their first mixtape in 2013, and in January, they released their self-titled debut album.
“I had gotten tired of people asking us to put groups together at the last minute for festivals and other things we were doing,” he said. “We were always playing together outside of our work with artists, so it was more like a family type of situation. We always wanted to play together, so the best excuse was just to make it a group.”
The album includes a wide range of sonic styles, weaving between fast-paced, funk-influenced cuts and slower, more soulful songs like “Spread Her Wings.” Unsurprisingly, there’s a laundry list of impressive features from artists like SiR, Bilal and Goapele, as well as Anderson .Paak features on “Black Hole” and “Clear View.”
“I’ve known [.Paak] since his name was Breezy [Lovejoy],” he said. “I was out in L.A. and we met at one of the clubs where he was playing drums, he told me he was a fan and we just connected. We’ve been cool ever since that day.”
In today’s era, it’s no big deal for artists to jump between sounds and styles the way the Drumhedz do on their album, but during the beginning stages of Dave’s career, those diverse skills often went underappreciated. Cliques within genres were entrenched in the musical landscape, and mingling between them was somewhat of a challenge, often drawing questioning looks rather than widespread acceptance.
“Everybody was so in their groups; jazz peers hung out with jazz peers, so if you weren’t in that zone, you wouldn’t know when and where they were hanging out,” he said. “Same with hip-hop, same with the blues cats, same with gospel. There were always a few of us that would run into each other at different spots, and it’d be like, ‘Why are you at this reggae club, you’re a gospel singer! Are you even allowed to be in here?’”
At many points, the drummer found himself moving in a different direction than what those around him were expecting and suggesting. Instead, he trusted his core instincts and interests rather than following the standard path, and if his illustrious career thus far is any indication, he’s been wise to do so.
“I’d be telling them, ‘Hey, I’m going to go play with Kenny Garrett,’ and they’re looking at me like, ‘You just got off tour with Janet Jackson! Why would you go play with some jazz dude?’” he said with a laugh. “Man, if you can’t play jazz on the drums, you can’t play sh-t.”

I’ve always been obsessed with the unattainable. Growing up, I had a mile-long list of lofty aspirations and high hopes for both the professional and personal aspects of my life. When I didn’t receive the highly coveted role of school newspaper editor my junior year of high school, I threw myself into trying to convince people that I loved journalism with all my being. 
I would spend late nights toggling through Google Chrome tabs filled with layout designs to present to my adviser the next afternoon. I often carried around extra copies of the newspaper so I could attack unsuspecting freshmen with the latest edition. I would also frequently go on aggressive rants about the peril of press censorship to the point where the staff would roll their eyes at me every time I opened my mouth, because they anticipated what was to come. You get the picture.
In pursuit of what I couldn’t have, I also clung onto people who wouldn’t give me the time of day and neglected those who truly cared for me. When it came to romantic partners, I would often idealize them to the point where I would blur the lines between my imagination and reality. I began to fabricate scenarios in my head to replay on loop when I was drifting off to sleep. Never mind that these people weren’t anything like the fictional characters my brain conjured up. I didn’t care — my perception was clouded by my ideas of whom I thought they were, and it was my mission to do anything in my might to get them to notice me. I often fell for emotionally unavailable boys whom I knew didn’t have the capacity to return my feelings because they were the easiest to imagine. I’ve always been keen on dangerous romanticism.  
Now, I’m pretty sure there are psychological explanations for my flighty behavior and muddied mindset. However, I think what it boils down to is that I used external circumstances to reinforce my self-perceptions. I could easily discredit years of accomplishments in a single sentence to anyone who complimented me because I was still dissatisfied. Part of this stemmed from having strict Asian parents who drilled into my head that good could always be better.

The other half came from a deep need to somehow prove myself to others. Nothing was ever enough. But predominantly, I was never enough. Because I couldn’t have something, I automatically assumed that it was my fault. I didn’t love journalism enough. I didn’t love him enough. I needed to self-correct and work to become the person that I wasn’t. To me, it wasn’t even the actual thing that I was struggling to attain that mattered as much. I viewed the prize as only a byproduct of the outcome of my improvement. 
So call me what you want: immature, selfish, entitled and insecure; I’ll wholeheartedly agree with said descriptors. I was all of those things wrapped in one. To the casual passerby I was just ambitious. Internally, though, I had a deep-rooted insecurity that led me to constantly cover up what I saw as shortcomings by piling on more extracurriculars, padding my resume and making more friends.
We are often our own worst critics, and I was no exception. After closely examining my true intentions behind flinging myself at things and people, I realized that I was tired of chasing short-lived “happiness.” 
Just yesterday I got an email reading “We received a record number of applicants this year. Unfortunately, you have not been selected for the next round blah blah blah” and I am proud to say that I didn’t autopilot into a downward spiral. This is proof that I am getting better and am being less dramatic about rejection (I know, shocking!). When I got into USC I was forced to accept that I would inevitably be dissatisfied with myself. After all, you can do a ton here and still feel like you are not doing enough because one activity will be quickly replaced by another. 
There will always be a new internship or a different someone. I am burnt out and tired of succumbing to external  expectations. I am no longer standing on my tippy toes to reach for the elusive or gauging my worth in what I do: Enough is enough.

At 15 years old, Xavier Mountain entered the foster care system for the second time. He had first entered it at just 2 years old, because his mother struggled with drug abuse and his father, an undocumented worker, wasn’t granted custody. The second time Mountain entered the system, he said it was because he confronted his abusive adopted father. Mountain bounced in and out of group homes until he was 18, at one point attending five high schools in the span of six months.

“At 15 years old you’re more worried about who likes you — that’s what you should be [worried about,] but as a foster youth I wasn’t able to do that,” he said. “I was focusing more on where I was going to go next, who do I have to meet, who do I have to adapt to.”
Now a graduate student studying social work at USC, Mountain works to advocate for foster youth going through the same problems he did. Through John Burton Advocates for Youth, an organization dedicated to helping students pursue a higher education, Mountain is lobbying to pass California State Senate Bill 940.
The bill, which was first introduced in January, proposes three changes to Cal Grant policies to better benefit foster care students.  First, it asks that foster youth remain eligible to apply for the grant until age 26, rather than only being eligible within one year of high school graduation. Second, it asks that they remain eligible for the grant for eight years, rather than four years. Finally, it asks that the deadline to apply to the grant is extended form March 2 to Sept. 2 for foster youth.
Mountain said foster students are disadvantaged in the areas addressed by the bill because of their elevated responsibilities and lack of parental guidance and mentorship. Without the support, many students remain unaware of deadlines and take longer to go through school because they must provide for themselves.
“You have your car bill, you have your phone bill, you have your insurance bill, you have your housing,” Mountain said. “You are your own everything. At 18 years old, you went from being taken care of in the foster care system to just thrown out in the streets.”
According to John Burton Advocates for Youth, 85 percent of foster care youth first attend community college, compared to 36 percent in the general population, and that it takes an average of 7.9 years for community college students to receive a bachelor’s degree. Because of this, they are in need of an extension of the grant to get full support for their education, he said.
“I stayed in college for five years,” said Demontea Thompson, a USC alumnus who went through the foster care system and now advocates for foster youth. “Most foster youth are at community colleges and then they move on over to four year universities. Once they are at four year universities they realize that their eligibility is limited … so now providing eight years for that support is needed.”
According to John Burton Advocates for Youth project director Debbie Raucher, a study conducted by the organization two years ago conveyed that only 9 percent of foster youth were receiving the Cal Grant in comparison to the 85 percent of those same students who were receiving the Promise Grant, despite Cal Grant being the largest form of state financial aid.
“We knew from that that they do meet the income criteria, but they weren’t getting through the various hoops they needed to jump through in order to qualify for the Cal Grant,” Raucher said. 
Senate Bill 940 recently passed through the Senate Education Committee. Generally, it takes about nine months to a year for a bill to reach the governor for approval, Mountain said. In the meantime, Mountain and John Burton Advocates for Youth are urging community members to write letters of support.
Through his advocacy, Mountain wants to bring recognition to the struggles of foster youth that often go unrecognized.
“A lot of people don’t pay attention to foster youth,” he said. “How can you tell a foster youth? You can’t. You can tell a race, you can tell ethnicity but [for] foster youth either you do or you don’t because you have to be in that circle. Because it’s not obvious, it becomes one of those things that gets pushed under the rug or doesn’t get enough attention and enough funding.”
Mountain first began to get involved in advocating for foster youth through fundraising and speaking when he entered community college. Since then, he has joined John Burton Advocates for Youth as a youth advocate and has been working on lobbying for legislative bills geared at higher education support for foster students. 
“There’s beautiful motivational speeches,” he said. “That’s great and that gets the ball rolling, but we need substance that can keep it going … I felt like I could do it because I was a part of that world. I was a foster youth and there’s no better voice than the voice of the foster youth.”

The USC Price School of Public Policy is now ranked  2019’s second best graduate public affairs program in the nation by the U.S. News and World Report. 
Photo from Price School of Public Policy.
Price ties for second with Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. Price Dean Jack H. Knott said this reflects the dedication of the school’s students and faculty.
“I attribute this steady ascent in the rankings to our exceptional faculty, students and staff who are deeply committed to fulfilling our mission to improve the quality of life for people and their communities, here and abroad,” Knott said in a news release. 
U.S. News determines its rankings based on peer reviews. Surveys are sent to 282 master’s programs nationwide and are filled out by deans, directors and department chairs. The respondents rank peer institutions on a scale of one to five which is then totaled and averaged to determine the nationwide ranking. According to U.S. News’ website, this year’s response rate was 49 percent.
Individual programs within the school are also ranked. Price is ranked first for its urban planning program and ranked third for both its health policy and management program and its homeland and national security program. 
The school’s other programs ranked highly as well, with the lowest ranking being the public finance and budgeting program at 13th in the nation. 
Knott said it is “deeply gratifying” for Price to be ranked as one of the best in the nation. He recognizes that rankings do not entirely define a school, but said this news marks the upward trajectory of the Price School.
“I am equally proud of who we are, what we stand for and the significant role each of us plays as part of our amazing USC Price School community,” Knott said.

When senior Nathan Dhablania traveled to Panama during his spring break last year, he noticed several health risks, such as access to clean water, food and education.

“I’ve also noticed the same disparities in the United States, specifically in Los Angeles,” said Dhablania, who is majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “It’s surprising to me that in Los Angeles we have so much money and resources and not much is being done.” 
Dhablania said the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles inspired him to take the knowledge he learned abroad and tackle those disparities locally. Currently there are 57,794 individuals experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County, according to the 2017 Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. That’s why he founded the student club WorldMed @ UPC on campus. 
Since last spring, WorldMed has aimed to bring students together to promote awareness of health disparities within Los Angeles and to train emerging leaders in the global health field. The club primarily focuses on four kinds of disparities: nutrition, education, clean water access and homelessness. 
Since the club was founded, WorldMed members have held health fairs at 32nd St. School, an elementary school near the USC campus, fundraisers for breast cancer awareness and Wednesday Night Missions. Held every two weeks, Wednesday Night Missions have club members join together to make several hundred peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to deliver to homeless people on Skid Row. 
According to vice president Sammy Cohen, the shoes and clothes drives have been the most notable events the club organizes this year. Before the end of this semester, WorldMed members say they hope to hold one more drive. Coordinated with Pathways Homeless Shelters, WorldMed members host drives at USC Housing, the University Gateway Apartments and the Lorenzo Apartments, to give donations to homeless people in the Los Angeles area. 
“I think the shoes and clothing drive was the pinnacle event,” Dhablania said. “Everyone had to pitch in. It’s not like Wednesday Night Mission where sometimes there can be too many people that you can’t get involved … With the shoes and clothing drive, everybody’s accountable for a different area.” 
The new events that began this semester include hosting students from Roosevelt High School to share their college experiences, volunteering at the St. Eugene science fair with the chapter at the Health Sciences campus, presenting on health care with Press Friends and working on Shower of Hope, an event where members assist the staff of a mobile shower unit and hand out sanitation supplies. Shower of Hope is held by a nonprofit organization called Lava Mae, which turns old transportation buses into showers and toilets on wheels to bring hygienic resources to homeless people in Los Angeles.
“I would definitely love to have a bigger impact on the homeless community,” Sabrina Barrow, the WorldMed philanthropy director, said. “[We] probably should be doing something to help them get back on their feet. Listening to members and what they want to do is also important.” 
Cohen said the club hopes to focus on tackling one issue at a time so they can address them on a deeper level.
“Because we have so many people, we can do a lot of good work in one specific area,” Cohen said.
