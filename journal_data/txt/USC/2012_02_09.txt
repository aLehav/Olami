The No. 6 USC Trojans men’s volleyball team is gearing up to play No. 10 Pepperdine at home tonight after a stunning loss at the hands of UCLA last week at the Galen Center.
“Any time you lose a match it’s no good. And losing to a rival is less good,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “Even though I’ve seen us go 9-4 against them so far, maybe it’s a good thing. Maybe it’s a wake-up call. We’ve had really good practices with a motivated group of guys.”
Whether it be a result of film studies, on-court drills or weights, the Trojans have showed a refreshed intensity in their practices this week.
“We’re a young team, and it seems like we didn’t realize how good our competition would be,” said senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli. “We realized we need to work harder.”
Pepperdine lost key starters from last year’s squad and is looking to re-establish itself with young, top-tier talent in a manner similar to USC.
Key to the Waves’ attack are junior opposite Maurice Torres and freshman outside hitter Josh Taylor. They are third and eighth in kills in the conference, respectively, with 4.02 and 3.53 per set.
“They’re similar to us in makeup with a couple of upperclassmen and some young guys with a lot of promise,” Ferguson said. “But they’re much bigger physically than us. They focus on hitting, serving and blocking. We have to limit what they do offensively to be successful.”
The clash of styles plays well for the Trojans as their defense has been consistently strong as a unit. They are ranked first in the conference with 9.13 digs per set and second in the conference in opponent hitting percentage  (.214).
“We have to control the ball and serve tough,” Ferguson said. “We have to grind out our points.”
Both teams have played UC Santa Barbara this year with vastly different results. Pepperdine lost 3-1 while the Trojans swept the Gauchos.
“Those couple of losses really humbled us,” said senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick. “But any loss is motivation. We can’t get complacent.”
I agree with Stanley Cheng. Our Mens Volley team is very talented. I believe they were a bit “OVER CONFIDENT” AGAINST  the bruins.  Coach Skates had his boys playing well. They want him to go out a winner in his swan song year. We played well in parts, but made way too many mistakes. 
I believe we will come out and smoke Pep tonight. Our youth will mature and our chemistry will improve.
Remember we took BYU to 4 games……and then and then the next night at altitude again…. to 5 games, losing 15-13 in game 5 at PROVO.
Then we gave away a game with set point v. ucla .
Byu & UCI were #1 &#2 respectively when we played them. We had a chance to beat uci in two of the sets.
We have to serve better [limit needless service errors.]…..continue to anticipate blocks and hit around them or at the right angle,  and BLOCK like we are capable of doing.  I thought Ucla beat us on kills from the middle
way too often.  #6 Dunlap?? really hurt us.
I believe we should set our MB’s more often.  We have depth, we lack experience, and sometimes chemistry.
Keep the Faith Trojans!! This team has what it takes to win it all.
The Final Four is at Galen.  We need to peak going into the MPSF.
Come out and support these great players and coaches as we show the waves of Pep how its done.
Fight On!
This one loss to that school across town should not harm the team. I see it as motivation. Just look at the female counterpart of that team (Women’s Volleyball). It took one messy game against that other school in front of a huge crowd and I wasn’t disappointed at a home game ever again. I even went across town the day before the utter dominance by the football team to witness the women’s win over the baby blue. I want to see the same out of the Men’s team. Fight on!

Following two resounding road wins over No. 6 Stanford and No. 13 California, USC men’s tennis will tackle one more opponent before the ITA National Team Indoor Championships next weekend in Virginia.
Undefeated · Senior Daniel Nguyen and the Trojans have not lost since losing to Stanford last February. USC is 6-0 on the season. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
 
No. 1 USC (6-0) will face No. 12 Pepperdine (3-2) in Malibu Friday at 1 p.m. in an attempt to extend its win streak to 26 matches, going back to the team’s championship run last season.
The Trojans have yet to relinquish a doubles match to any team ranked behind their consistent doubles team. Doubles partners No. 1 senior Steve Johnson and No. 33 freshman Yannick Hanfmann have lost only one doubles match this season.
“Yannick and I have really bonded quickly, and the chemistry is there,” Johnson said. “It’s been fun to play with Yannick. He’s a very talented individual.”
Senior Daniel Nguyen and sophomore Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 16 and No. 12, respectively, hold a 10–3 doubles record, while No. 48 sophomore Emilio Gomez and freshman Roberto Quiroz stand at 7-1.
“Anything could happen in a pro set, but we feel really comfortable on our courts,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “We have three great teams. If they beat us in doubles, then congratulations — now they [get] to play us in singles.”
Hanfmann and Sarmiento had their singles streaks broken in the last match against Cal and hope to bounce back with wins against the Waves, who are led by No. 21 junior Sebastian Fanselow and No. 35 junior Finn Tearney.
“I let him dictate the match early on,” Sarmiento said, regarding his three-set loss to Cal’s Carlos Cueto. “I only lost by two points in the end, but I need to focus better and start better.”
Other Trojans still look to maintain their singles streaks, such as the reigning NCAA Singles Champion Johnson, who has led USC on the court with eight consecutive wins this season.
Though the Trojans will travel to Malibu looking for a strong victory, Smith hopes the Waves will bring their best to prepare the Trojans for the upcoming ITA Indoors Championships in Virginia from Feb. 17 to 20.
“I hope they have the greatest crowd in the history of crowds,” Smith said. “That’s why we’re going there — to face as tough of an opponent as possible in as tough of an atmosphere as possible, and that’s what we want.”
Come out and support Coach “3PETE” Smith & this incredible team.
I was fortunate to see us defeat ucla in last season’s finale at westwood.
Then I traveled to the NCAA championships at the farm in palo alto to see USC
defeat undefeated Virginia in the Finals.
These players and coaches are amazing.  Lets go Yannick, Emilio, Ray, Steve, Daniel, y Roberto!!!!
Fight On,
Game, Set, Match

For more than 50 years, the USC men’s basketball team called the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena home.
A landmark on its own, sure, but over time, the facilities were hardly up to par with other top-notch arenas around the country. To put it bluntly, if I were a recruit, I definitely wouldn’t be signed up to play in a dump.
But in 2006, the Galen Center opened. It was certainly a welcome change from the Sports Arena, and the opening of the new arena was supposed to be a new beginning for USC basketball.
In the years following the opening of the Galen Center, USC hauled in big high school stars, such as O.J. Mayo and DeMar Derozan. Despite playing one year each, the Trojans qualified for the NCAA tournament in both years Mayo and DeRozan donned the cardinal and gold. In fact, in four of the last five years, USC has earned a trip to the Big Dance. Despite sanctions imposed on the program, USC has managed to stay relatively competitive — until this year.
It’s been a snowball effect throughout the course of this long season. The Trojans have been dealt a hand that they can’t play well with. The injuries and the losses have piled up. The fans have all but abandoned the team, or so it seems.
Sure, next year looks to be promising with everybody returning. Students are not interested anymore, though. Alumni and other fans have been visibly upset. And they’re showing their displeasure in arguably the worst way possible not even showing up to home games.
With that in mind, however, can everybody forget this dismal year and give USC coach Kevin O’Neill one more shot?
Yes, they should and they can, but the Trojans need to do some work on the recruiting trail for that to happen. To make everybody put this season in the rearview mirror, USC needs to land the No. 1 overall player in the nation: Shabazz Muhammad.
The six-foot-six senior from Bishop Gorman High School in Nevada is averaging nearly 30 points and 10 rebounds a game, according to a MaxPreps.com article. He is the consensus No. 1 recruit in the country.
One player can do a lot for a fan base starving for someone to jumpstart a program coming off an underwhelming year. One player can give Los Angeles another team to cheer for.
Not since Mayo and DeRozan has USC enjoyed playing in front of a nearly sold out Galen Center. Not since those two hyped high school stars has there been a buzz around campus regarding another sport besides football.
Muhammad would solve all these problems in an instant. His size, strength and basketball acumen are unparalleled. NBADraft.net compares him to Kobe Bryant.
That alone says enough. What kind of fan wouldn’t want to see someone with the potential to be that good? If that doesn’t draw more students, I don’t know what will.
The star power, the energy and the excitement will be felt should the Trojans land Muhammad.
Attendance this season has been horrific — and that might be putting it lightly. I get it, though. After losing by 19 points and drawing a season-high 8,474 fans against UCLA in mid-January, I don’t blame anybody for not wanting to come back.
Let’s face it: O’Neill’s squads won’t wow us with offensive fireworks. The highlights on that end of the floor will be few and far between. The old adage that defense wins championships might ring true, but nobody truly likes to see teams grind out victories scoring 50 points per contest.
So even with everybody likely returning next season — and a chance for the team to be really good, win the Pac-12 conference and earn a bid to the NCAA tournament — there needs to be that one player who “wows” the crowd solely based on his name.
Without Shabazz Muhammad none of this happens, though. Land the best player in the nation and everybody forgets about this season. This is what the basketball program needs. He might be a lot to ask for, but one player can make basketball relevant again at USC.
 
 
“In the Zone” runs every other Friday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Trevor at trevor.wong@usc.edu
Shabazz’s father played for the Trojans which is the only reason they even have a foot in the door. You did not
mention this anywhere in your article otherwise why would he consider USC for one and done. The other thing
is why does Coach O’Neill deserve one more year? Assume a better roster with healthier players let someone
else bring the best out these men and bring an up tempo game for the fans to enjoy. The team had Fuller,
Deadmon, and Smith when they lost to Cal Poly at home scoring an astounding 36 pts. for the entire game.

There’s a reason Stanford is among the upper echelon of women’s college basketball.  The Cardinal showed why it’s reached the past four Final Fours in a 69-52 rout of USC on Thursday night. The Women of Troy were unable to contain the electric Ogwumike sisters, who dominated in the paint on both ends of the floor. The two combined for 43 points and 20 rebounds, while the younger Chiney had six blocks.
USC fought hard but picked a bad game to shoot poorly from the field. It’s 29.3 percent field goal shooting night was well below their season average of 37.7 percent.
Constantly trailing · The Women of Troy were never able to overcome an early deficit to the Cardinal. USC led once in the game. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
One positive note for the Women of Troy was their performance on the boards. Though they were outrebounded 37-31, USC pulled down 12 offensive rebounds compared to Stanford’s seven.
Seniors Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath led the team with 11 points apiece.
USC hung with Stanford to start the game but fell behind thanks to a 10-0 run by the Cardinal. That spurt proved to be the difference in the first half as Stanford headed to the locker room with an 11-point lead.
After cutting the lead to six to open the second half, USC fell behind after Stanford started to heat up. The lead grew to 18 points at the 8-minute mark and USC was unable to make a serious run at shrinking it.
For the Women of Troy, they will have to respond to this loss against Stanford the same way they did after their first meeting of the season: by beating Cal.  USC beat the Golden Bears 74-54 on Dec. 31 at the Galen Center.
“Cal is playing their best basketball right now,” said Corral. “They’ve been winning, but I definitely think we can go into Cal and win. I’ve never won at Cal, so we’re going to have to go in and take some momentum out of them.”
Cal is coming off a 67-58 win over UCLA and has won nine of its past 10 games. USC has now dropped five out of seven and has its record drop to 12-11 overall and 6-6 in conference play, tied for fifth with Arizona State.

The USC men’s basketball team dropped its third straight game on Thursday night, falling to California 75-49 at the Galen Center. The loss marked USC’s 15th defeat in its last 17 contests.
No home cookin’ · Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson had five points Thursday, shooting 2-14 from the field. As a team, the Trojans shot under 34 percent for the game, including 17.6 from behind the arc. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
It was a tale of two halves for the Trojans (6-19, 1-11), who were engaged in a close match featuring seven lead changes in the game’s first 20 minutes.
A costly turnover by sophomore guard Maurice Jones put Cal ahead 35-29 going into the break, which was the Golden Bears’ largest advantage up to that point.
The second half was a different story, as the Golden Bears (19-6, 9-3) recovered from an early three-point bucket courtesy of junior guard Greg Allen to outscore the Trojans 40-17 the rest of the way.
“I think the game was decided [in] the first five minutes of the second half,” USC coach Kevin O’Neil said.
During that five-minute stretch, Jones took a hard fall and had to take a temporary break from the action to bandage up a wound on his hand.
“When {Maurince Jones] is not in there we don’t function very well,” O’Neill said. “We’re asking too much of Mo.”
Jones led the way for the Trojans with 17 points on an efficient 8-13 shooting night. Only one other player, freshman guard Byron Wesley, joined him in double figures with 11 points. USC finished the game shooting 21-62 (33.9 percent), while the Golden Bears were 34-61 (55.7 percent).
“Cal is a good team, they’re a better team,” O’Neill said. “They’re at the top of the [conference] for a reason. They’re well-coached.”
Forward Harper Kamp was especially effective for the Golden Bears, scoring 14 of his 18 points after the break.
With 17:32 remaining, he started a string of six straight makes in a four-minute span to help blow the game open.
“He played like a senior is supposed to play,” O’Neill said. “He had a stretch of baskets where he made jumpers. That’s the way your guys are supposed to play at that age. He played extremely well tonight, and he did a great job for them.”
The Golden Bears also received strong performances from sophomore guard and Los Angeles native Allen Crabbe, who had 19 points, and freshman forward David Kravish, who grabbed 18 rebounds in the contest. Cal as a team controlled the boards, outrebounding USC 41-28.
“No matter what size you have, if you don’t gang rebound you’re not going to rebound well,” O’Neill said. “Especially with our size and our inexperience, we’ve got to become more of a hit-first team.”
The Trojans will finish out a two-game homestand on Sunday against the Stanford Cardinal (16-8, 6-6). Despite a strong start to the season, Stanford has struggled of late, losing five of its last six games. Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. and the game will be broadcast on the Fox Sports Network.

More than 5,600 students have joined the USC Meme Facebook page as of Thursday at 11:30 p.m.
The creators of the group, three freshmen, said they were surprised that it spread virally.
“When it was at two likes, I said it would never happen, people weren’t going to join, and I was about to quit the group,” said Ruthvik Peddavandla, a freshman majoring in engineering.
Creators Javan Shah (left), Adithya Manjunath (standing), and Ruthvik Peddavandla (right) now have more than 5,500 likes on their Facebook page USC Memes, which they launched this week.
When the page went live on Tuesday at 10 p.m., the three creators said they had produced six USC-related memes. Most of the memes posted on the page are made by visitors. They said they shared the group with the Class of 2015 and Marshall Undergraduates groups on Facebook and several of their friends.
“We barely did anything,” said Adithya Manjunath, a freshman majoring in communication. “It’s just the people on it who have posted their own memes, and it’s just gone viral.”
Javan Shah, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he was up until 2 a.m. moderating the page and scrolling through posts.
USC Memes was created after the three saw similar pages for other universities, though they believe USC was one of the first. Boston University created a similar page on Monday.
“We are really fond of memes,” Manjunath said. “We spend, or rather waste, a lot of time on memes. That’s the only reason we did it.”
Manjunath said he didn’t think many USC students followed Internet culture before the page went viral.
“I was under the illusion that people weren’t aware of memes at all,” Manjunath said. “But this page broke that belief because there are so many people who are really into creating and sharing them.”
The three creators originally launched the USC Memes Facebook page with six memes (one is pictured). Most memes on the page have been posted by visitors. - Courtesy of USC Memes
The creators said they think the desire to share and create memes is driven by community and competition.
“Everyone has their own story to tell through their own memes and people see the specific memes that show their commonality,” Manjunath said. “Then, people want to get as many likes as possible so they keep posting their own memes.”
Simca Bouma, a senior majoring in physics and math, said some of the meme creators needed to do some research before posting.
“It’s very mixed. What ruins it is some people don’t know how to use the memes,” Bouma said. “People should explore the world of memes before they post and that will keep it funny and popular.”
Chase Ginther, a freshman majoring in human performance, said he enjoyed the new community.
“I thought it was awesome,” Ginther said. “I made a few, but it’s something to do when I’m bored.”

More and more students are living in the area around campus, according to Student Affairs, and a larger number of students are interacting with community members each day.
Community watch · About 75 percent of housing on 36th Place between Vermont and Budlong avenues has been developed into non-university-owned student housing. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan 
The increase in students has also meant an increase in parties.
“The biggest complaint I get is student parties, from community members and the leaders representing those community members,” said David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations for the university.
Galaviz said the university has more than 400 partnerships with local schools, giving USC a direct stake in the welfare of elementary and high school students nearby.
“We don’t want them being kept up late on school nights or any night by USC student parties,” Galaviz said. “But at the same time, we went to college too and we want students to be able to have some fun as well.”
Jorge Crespo, a 51-year-old man who lives three blocks north of campus, said students can be disrespectful by partying.
“The parties are too loud and the streets are very messy in the aftermath,” Crespo said. “There should be more of an agreement and understanding between both groups.”
The Department of Public Safety has repeatedly said parties most often get shut down when DPS officers receive complaints from residents who live near students.
Galaviz said Student Affairs has been working on a code of conduct to teach students how to be better neighbors.
“[We’d like for] students to have a greater understanding and greater sensitivity that they are living in a residential community that the university and the surrounding community to be a part of,” Galaviz said. “We don’t want them to just live there for nine months and leave, though that does happen. We want them to feel like they’re investing in South Los Angeles and in the history of the area.”
At the same time, families and other long-term residents have been displaced.
In 1999, more than 90 percent of the housing on 36th Place between Vermont and Budlong avenues served the community, according to a survey from United Neighbors In Defense Against Displacement of Los Angeles. In 2009, 25 percent of housing remained community-serving while the remaining 75 percent was developed into non-university-owned student housing.
The university assigned CSC yellow jackets to the area west of Vermont Avenue for additional security last year in response to the larger number of students living there.
Marie Mendez, a mother of three living four blocks from the south side of campus, said there are more students living in the area around her home in the last two years.
“It has definitely had an impact,” Mendez said. “I can see more kids in the area shopping or just walking about.”
Galaviz said the university hopes to partially reduce the number of students living in the community with The Village, which will add 4,200 beds to university housing, but that USC doesn’t have another place to add housing.
“The university committed to not buy anything west of Vermont [Avenue] and we haven’t done that,” Galaviz said. “We can’t buy anything from Exposition Park because it’s owned by the city and we can’t go east because there’s warehouses and factories.”
President of the Neighborhood Council Shawn Simons said moving students into university housing will help the situation.
“The Village is a perfect initiative for the school to promote unity in the community as well as provide locals with their privacy and usual surroundings,” Simon said.
The Village will add an estimated 3,000 permanent jobs to the area.
“We’re proud of our history and partnership in South Los Angeles,” Galaviz said. “The university’s been here for 130-plus years. When other institutions left, the university could have left, but the university stayed. We’re very proud of that.”
Sad to say, but USC students, including those who party, are generally better neighbors than those who would be “displaced” by them.   Apartments are temporary housing, folks.  You have the right to move elsewhere.
You’re living in an area filled with college students and you bitch and moan about students partying? Sorry that we spend our weekdays working our asses off and like to blow off some steam on the weekends. 
USC spends $50 million+ a year helping out and improving the community, and yet the only community feedback I hear is negative. Be a little more grateful perhaps?
If they aren’t stealing our bikes they are complaining that the USC free Christmas tree program wasn’t giving out nice enough trees last Christmas.  The “Community” are a bunch of ungrateful takers always looking for another freebie from the rich neighbor…
I my 20+ years here, I have seen considerate gatherings and inconsiderate ones (though with my somewhat limited exposure to USC nightlife). We need to promote the positive interactions with the community, and discourage the negative ones. It shoudn’t be that hard to keep things “win-win” for all parties involved. 
Let the learning experience here be truly full spectrum.
Llet students drink on campus in dorms. Problem solved.
How about building some housing NORTH of Campus -tear down some of the crap and put up some higher density student housing–what are you waiting for USC?
This is decades over-due
It’s a shame that “United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement” doesn’t consider USC students to be part of the community. We certainly do, and we’ve lived next to USC for 21 years. During that time, the improvement in the neighborhood north of USC has been remarkable. The availability of student renters has allowed hundreds of local owners to upgrade their properties, while other owners chose to “displace” themselves by selling their homes at prices they’d only dreamed of. As for the noisy party houses, they’re a minority and there are ways to deal with them. The solutions lie in management and enforcement, not in banishing students from the community.
USC is the only redeeming part of South Central, they can do whatever they want.
Yes, students should be mindful and respect their neighbors. We have kids that go to the local schools and wake up to see a messed up streets by USC College Students. That is just a really bad example they are setting.

The Center for Excellence in Teaching hosted an event Thursday to inform students about obtaining research opportunities.
The event, Now You Know: How To Get Research, featured a presentation with details on finding and acquiring research assistant positions as an undergraduate, along with a panel of students who have participated in research.
The CET is an institution that works closely with the Office of the Provost to organize events and discussions about how to improve classroom experiences for students, teachers and teaching assistants.
Carson Lam, a freshman majoring in business administration and psychology and an undergraduate fellow for CET, was one of the event’s hosts and helped organize the event so students could discover research opportunities at USC.
“I really wanted to do this event because I’ve always wondered about research, and at the end of last semester, I got the opportunity to be a research assistant,” Lam said.
“I felt like it would be really cool to just workshop with other students who want to learn about research. It’s a mystery for a lot of students that we want to demystify.”
Lam emphasized that research is not just for students interested in the sciences and that it is not necessary to be an expert in the field you want to research in.
Brenda Yang, a senior majoring in interdisciplinary studies and a CET undergraduate fellow, recommended several methods of finding research opportunities, including talking to professors, following up on help-wanted postings and emailing researchers.
“There is no formula to getting research,” Yang said. “If you work hard, if you are interested, if you are persistent, it is totally feasible to do.”
Speakers at the event also mentioned that there are many opportunities to do research in the summer, on and off campus.
Gene Bickers, vice provost for Undergraduate Programs, said involvement in research provides students with a valuable experience outside the classroom.
“[Research] is the chance to become active in a new problem,” Bickers said. “It’s an open-ended problem where there’s no known answer, and that can be exciting. It’s also the chance to work with a professor one-on-one or in a small group setting, and it’s a chance to get a lot of good experience with what you may be doing after graduation.”
Bickers also stressed the importance of taking initiative to learn about research opportunities as early as possible.
Student panelists at the event shared stories of their personal experiences in research. The session concluded with an individual question-and-answer period with the panelists.
Kathryn Kinas, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the event opened her eyes to many chances to do research at USC.
“After coming to this seminar, I fully intend to approach one of my professors in the future and get involved with the many research opportunities that USC provides,” Kinas said.
CET, founded in 1996, aims to provide leadership and support to the development of the university’s learner-centered education and is responsible for programs such as the teaching assistant program.

Guests gather in the Social Science Building for a wine tasting and lecture by Lester Little, an emeritus professor of history and former president of the Medieval Academy of America, on Thursday. The event was sponsored by the USC Center for Religion and Civic Culture.
 
Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
[clarification] As an adult alumnus (BA, ’65), I noticed that the ” tasting ” of wine was mentioned, but not the subject or substance of the lecture.   Was this a medieval practice?   Medieval students would prefer ” drinking ” of wine, rather than ” tasting “.

This spring, the Dornsife Scholars Program will honor outstanding graduating seniors who have bridged academic achievement with concerns for positive human impact.
The new Dornsife Scholars Program, announced Wednesday, is named after Dornsife benefactors and USC trustees David and Dana Dornsife. The scholarship will recognize students with the capacity to improve lives throughout the world. The scholarship program is one of the first uses of the Dornsifes’ historic gift to the university, according to Vice Dean for Academic Programs Steven Lamy.
Thinking big · Approximately 10 students from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences who demonstrate a dedication to bettering humanity will be selected as the first class of Dornsife Scholars this spring. - Daily Trojan file photo
“It is important for the program to emphasize the notion of making a difference in the world, because that’s what the Dornsifes have done,” Lamy said. “They have dedicated their lives to making the world a better place, so we felt it was important to have that as one of the critical aspects of this scholarship program.”
The program seeks the same caliber of students who are recognized by current undergraduate scholars programs, including Renaissance Scholars, Discovery Scholars and Global Scholars, Lamy said. These pre-existing programs reward students who have pursued diverse academic disciplines, developed their own scholarly work or art or displayed academic success at USC and abroad.
“[Dornsife Scholars] will look for the same quality type of person [who] would apply for the current programs, but the characteristics we look for are a little different,” Lamy said.  “We want students who have high academic achievement, are majors in the Dornsife College, have a strong and challenging academic background, have taken advantage of research with professors and have taken advantage of study abroad opportunities.”
Dana Dornsife said the scholarship will allow students to use their education in a global context.
“Dave and I are thrilled that the Dornsife Scholars Program combines all of the best facets of education within Dornsife College with the opportunity to expand scholarly experience and apply it globally to create a true positive impact,” Dana Dornsife said.
Approximately 10 Dornsife students demonstrating academic excellence in the humanities, social sciences or natural sciences and a dedication to bettering humanity will be selected as the first class of Dornsife Scholars. The recipients will each receive $10,000 toward graduate or professional school studies.
“We see USC education as the first step, and we are trying to help students with the next step,” Lamy said.  “We want our students to continue their education and do well, so we will do anything we can to help undergraduates.”
The Dornsife College will hold information sessions about the program throughout the semester.  Applications are due April 1 and will be evaluated by a committee consisting of directors of undergraduate study and faculty members from the various programs within Dornsife.
Lamy said he envisions the Dornsife Scholars Program will forge a community among scholars and serve as a model for other schools at USC.
“We see this program as creating a community of essential future scholars and change agents who are out there impacting the world,” Lamy said.  “Our dream is to produce students who are not only USC grads and members of the Trojan Family, but also part of the Dornsife Scholars community.”

USC wide receivers coach Ted Gilmore’s departure to the NFL’s Oakland Raiders opened up another assistant role on the USC football coaching staff this week following linebackers coach Joe Barry’s move to the San Diego Chargers, according to the Los Angeles Times.
With four weeks before spring practice begins, coach Lane Kiffin should not encounter difficulty in finding a willing replacement to coach a group that includes one of the best duos in the country: junior wide receiver Robert Woods and freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee.
According to Twitter, USC’s talented wide receiver corps has not been shy about its preference. On Wednesday, Woods tweeted that he wanted former USC standout Keary Colbert to coach the position group.
Colbert served as a tight ends coach at USC during the 2010 season before attempting to rekindle his career in the NFL. He registered nine receptions for 89 yards for the Kansas City Chiefs last season before being waived in November 2011.

The spring semester is heading into the thick of assignments and projects, meaning more stress and less free time.
It’s important, however, that students continue to incorporate exercise into their schedules: Fitness helps ease the daily stress of dealing with overwhelming academic work, and it also keeps the body properly rested. A frequent exercise regimen stimulates the mind and factors in college success.
Healthy living · Unique, group workout ideas, like swimming with friends, help make exercise more exciting. Between school, extracurriculars and other commitments, it can be difficult to find time to fit in an exercise routine, but with these tricks of the trade you’ll be sure to make time. - Mason Khoo | Daily Trojan
Considering that USC students are lucky enough to experience college life in a city bordered by the Pacific Ocean, beach fitness activities should top the list of workout options. Saturday afternoons can be rejuvenated with a trip to one of the many beaches near USC, where warm sand and a host of creative exercise options await.
Competition can be a great motivator for physical exercise. Weekend beach volleyball with friends brings the excitement to fitness after an entire week of monotonous classroom academics. For those looking for something more calming, yoga workouts performed on the beach are perfect for physical and spiritual enrichment and can make a normal routine feel special. The waves crashing soothingly in the background also help make a routine unique.
A trip to the beach can also be a great escape from all that convenient fast food: Try coordinating a beach picnic with homemade sandwiches and fresh salads made with seasonal produce. A made-from-scratch meal eaten on the shoreline will leave you feeling satisfied and guilt-free.
Not in the mood for fun in the sand? Dance parties are a unique form of working out too. Zumba videos, choreographed hip-hop routines or fitness videos can be challenging tasks for those who only dance to stay fit. Dance workout parties also provide a social setting where friends can come together before indulging themselves in studious tasks or taking part in weekend college night life.
Again, the promise of delicious snacks can make the workout especially enticing: Tasty smoothies — whipped up in minutes with some fresh or frozen fruit and juices — can be a refreshing pick-me-up or just a nice reward for a successful workout session.
A trip to a swimming pool for some unique, group-focused water aerobics or swimming laps is a great idea for keeping the body toned. Aqua aerobics aren’t just for old people — there are plenty of intriguing options, such as aquatic kickboxing and Pilates.
It’s especially effective if someone is knowledgeable about aerobic exercises and can lead them, but it’s always fun to try something totally new. Aquatic exercise benefits the body a great deal without the stress of many land-based exercises and can be a fun twist to the usual routines.
Though it might seem intimidating, small-group fitness training sessions are an amazing opportunity for friends to join together with a professional personal trainer.
These sessions give participating students the chance to get more personal attention, which can’t be found in a class with large groups of people and can maximize the benefits of a workout routine. This option is great for those who prefer being coached instead of passively watching fitness videos.
There are also options for students who find using USC’s fitness facility most convenient or for those who prefer larger workout settings. USC’s Lyon Center offers students the opportunity to take a variety of fitness classes for the entire semester, including yoga, SCycling, Pilates, muscle conditioning, “step & weights,” turbokick and so on. Best of all, students can choose to attend sessions when they please and during times that fit their weekly schedules. In addition, there are also many helpful wellness programs that provide knowledge on fitness and nutrition — a session can enlighten on the finer points of staying healthy on a college budget.
The school week tends to be hectic, so unwind with some unconventional, focused workouts. A more social experience brings motivation and inspiration to regular exercise, and can be a way for students to promote health and fitness to perhaps less-motivated peers.
Working out doesn’t have to be another lonely evening on the treadmill with the earbuds in. With a little creativity, students can reap the benefits of greater physical health without sacrificing entertainment.

Paramore, Green Day and MxPx have lost at least one founding member. But these bands have redefined themselves and have emerged stronger than ever.
When bands lose a member, they often go through a natural grieving phase but proceed with a willful determination not to disappoint their fans.
Maybe the departure was on good terms, or perhaps it was the opposite of an amicable split, but no matter what, bands want to persevere through inevitable changes.
For some bands, departures happen early. Tré Cool, for example, has not always been the drummer for pop-punk band Green Day, although he has been on the majority of the band’s records. John Kiffmeyer joined with frontman Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt to form Green Day in 1987 and played on the band’s debut album 39/Smooth.
In 1990, Kiffmeyer left the band to attend college, leaving room for Cool to come in and help the band finish its second record Kerplunk! From then on, Cool has been behind the drum set, and now the reformed trio is one of the most well-known rock bands.
Punk band MxPx also went through a similar loss. After it released its first CD, Pokinatcha, the band lost its original guitarist, Andy Husted. Soon after, Tom Wisniewski took over, and he has been the guitarist ever since. Now in its 20th year as a band, MxPx is set to release its ninth studio album, Plans Within Plans, on April 3.
In these two instances, the losses were not too detrimental to the bands’ well-being because they were able to find replacements relatively quickly. In fact, these replacements ended up becoming mainstays who have helped the bands evolve into what they are today.
In other cases, however, departures don’t go nearly as well.
In the case of Paramore, ex-members Josh and Zac Farro, brothers who played guitar and drums, respectively, surprised fans with their unexpected departure in December 2010. They shocked the music world even more when Josh Farro released a blog post saying that Paramore was “a manufactured product of a major label” and that everyone in the band besides singer Hayley Williams was just a pawn in the label’s game.
Williams and the two remaining members, Jeremy Davis and Taylor York, denied the claims and promised fans that they would be getting back to work to release their best album yet after some touring.
Fans, however, did not know what to expect from the band. Josh Farro played a major part in the band’s songwriting, and York took over those duties after Farro’s departure.
York’s work has helped lead Paramore to a newer sound that seems to take influences from a wider variety of genres than the band’s back catalog did. Two examples of this are the hard-hitting anthem “Monster,” as well as the somber folksy tune “In the Mourning.”
So even after losing two members, Paramore appears to be more creative and inspired than ever, and the band has set the bar high for the upcoming release of its fourth studio album sometime in 2012.
Though Paramore’s story was a success, other bands have had to deal with truly tragic departures. Five-piece rock band Hawthorne Heights lost its guitarist/vocalist Casey Calvert when he passed away while the band was on tour. Calvert was an integral part of the band, as he provided all of the screaming vocals in the band’s songs to complement the melodies of lead vocalist JT Woodruff.
Hawthorne Heights re-emerged after some much-needed time off and continued touring and releasing records.
To keep Calvert’s memory alive, the band told fans that it would not find a replacement to do his screaming vocals while on tour. Instead, the crowd filled in for Calvert at each show in memory of him.
Screaming was absent on the band’s next record, 2008’s Fragile Future, which left behind the band’s hardcore arrangements and instead focused on an alternative-rock feel. The 2010 follow-up, Skeletons, also had an alternative feel, although lead guitarist Micah Carli did start doing some screaming vocals for the band.
Now, Hawthorne Heights has recently released an EP called Hate, which is the roughest and rawest music that they have ever created. Though the band has not replaced Calvert in honor of his memory, it has added a touring guitarist to its lineup, and Carli is now the official “unclean” vocalist of the band.
The band’s loss of Calvert no doubt made it rethink its sound, but now it appears the members are comfortable enough to write music that appeals to the band’s hardcore and alternative influences as it continues in its career. Hate was the first in a trilogy of EPs the band is working on, and fans can expect its follow-up sometime this year.
Naturally, losing a member is a common obstacle many bands must overcome, and some acts face harder departures than others. But every band that goes through a loss will ultimately end up being defined by how they respond to it, and how it changes them, for better or for worse.

Clybourne Park, winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for drama, will head to Broadway April 19, but not before finishing its superb run at the Mark Taper Forum.
Societal critique · Jeremy Shamos (left), Annie Parisse (center) and Brendan Griffin (right) offer exceptional performances in Clybourne Park, the follow-up play to A Raisin in the Sun, which confronts racism in the 1950s. - Photo courtesy of Center Theatre
In response to Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun, the first scene of playwright Bruce Norris’ Clybourne Park brings audiences into the living room of one of the most famous homes in American theater.
In A Raisin in the Sun, the Youngers, a black family in the 1950s, argues over how to use an insurance check after the patriarch of the family dies. Lena Younger, the matriarch, decides to use the money to buy the home she and her husband always wanted.
The house, however, resides in Clybourne Park, an affluent white neighborhood. And Karl, a representative from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, fails to dissuade the Youngers from moving into their new home.
Also taking place in 1959, Clybourne Park, directed by Pam MacKinnon, opens with Bev (Christina Kirk) and Russ (Frank Wood) packing to leave the home in which their son, a Korean War veteran, committed suicide. Caring only about the neighborhood’s “culture,” Karl (Jeremy Shamos) stops by the home — with his deaf wife, Betsy (Annie Parisse) — to ask Bev and Russ to reconsider their move.
The living room becomes crowded with a clergyman (Brendan Griffin) sent to help Russ; a black maid (Crystal A. Dickinson) and her husband (Damon Gupton), who offer to help Bev even though she continues to patronize them; and Karl and a clueless Betsy, whose husband continues to harass Russ about the Youngers.
Hilarity ensues as the characters ignorantly allow racism to quickly take over their heated conversations.
The second act, in which the same actors occupy new roles, opens to the same living room 50 years later, now damaged and worn down with graffiti, and proves that not much has changed in terms of stereotypes and racism.
Lindsey (Parisse) and Steve (Shamos) plan to tear down the house to build a new one. The great-granddaughter of Lena Younger, also named Lena (Dickinson), petitions with her husband, Kevin (Gupton), and Tom (Griffin), the representative of the Owners Association, to stop the new owners from building a two-story home.
Lena wants to preserve the history of the home. But her defense rings eerily similar to Karl’s, who wanted to preserve the culture of the neighborhood. And just as quickly as the first act, the tension becomes unbearable in the second. The characters seem to be more self-aware of prejudices and stereotypes, but this doesn’t stop them from making blatantly racist jokes. Norris successfully mocks society and the great strides it thinks it has made.
The actors do an excellent job of expressing each character’s flaws and emotions. As Wood channels Russ’s anger, he gets audiences to understand the character’s pain. Russ, a grieving father angry at the neighborhood for the poor reception his son received after neighbors found out he killed civilians while in battle, gives up on society’s hypocrisies and lashes out at everyone in the living room.
And Shamos perfectly portrays Karl as the most disagreeable character. Dickson, however, does not successfully switch into her new role in the second act. Though all the actors noticeably change their dialect to fit with the 2009 time period, Dickson continues to sound like the 1950s maid she portrays in the first act.
At times, the actors go too far — the script at fault —  in their seemingly pointless discussions, such as the origin of the name for Neapolitan ice cream. The ice cream symbolizes the themes of race and integration Norris intends for the audience to pick up, but the extensive talk about ice cream fails to entertain the audience.
Before coming to the Mark Taper Forum, Clybourne Park ran in Playwrights Horizons in a proscenium theater. For its Los Angeles venue, the set was adapted for a thrust stage. Scenic designer Daniel Ostling constructs a naturalistic set that effectively takes the audience into the 1950s and right back to recent times in 2009.
And the costumes by designer Ilona Somogyi only complement the set to bring about the same effect on the audience. The changes in set and costumes snap the audience back into current society — a society audiences can relate to — to be able to put the second act into a better perspective.
Though A Raisin in the Sun might make audiences leave the theater thinking the 1950s were a different time, Clybourne Park makes a connection to the present with the audience.
The Pulitzer Prize winner leaves audience members gasping at racist jokes but quickly causes them to laugh, leaving audiences to wonder how different they are from the characters onstage.
 
Clybourne Park is playing at the Mark Taper Forum at the Music Center in Downtown Los Angeles through Feb. 26.

America’s economy isn’t doing so hot right now. But once upon a time, it was thriving beyond what most people thought was possible. The nation experienced significant economic peaks in the 1920s and 1960s. These two eras had one vital detail in common: Both were prefaced by a highly active foreign policy.
The process is relatively simple. A dynamic foreign policy yields global influence, which yields global power, which yields a more dominant economic and political system.
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
 
It worked after the United States helped put an end to World War I, and it worked again after the struggle against communism kept America an active player on the world stage.
Graduating into a healthy economy is extremely important to students. We should urge our next presidential elect to maintain American involvement in foreign affairs.
The policy needn’t be excessive. The war in Iraq is evidence enough that too much intervention can lead to catastrophe. But well-reasoned foreign involvement — where the cause is just, the stakes are understood and the objectives are clear — offers the nation a chance to improve its international prospects.
The issue goes beyond the economy. We are a generation that has grown up with the American dream of free speech and free enterprise fully realized. Regardless of difficulties arising in its application, we appreciate democracy and basic free-market principles. It is what we know, what we love and what much of the world stands to benefit from.
The moment the United States drops out of the international community is the moment that system instantly loses its global defender.
Recently, the Arab Spring arrived in Syria, where protestors rallying for recognition of their basic rights have faced a brutal government crackdown. Though the United States has condemned the actions of the Syrian government, it has not yet actively intervened.
In the interest of preserving global influence and of promoting American political values, the United States should do more than condemn the crackdown. If intervention is executed correctly, it could bring us the rare benefit of a democratic ally in the Middle East.
The human rights aspect of the Syrian problem should not go ignored either. In an era that puts a strong emphasis on being global citizens — illustrated by our own university’s burgeoning international focus — our duty to protect all people from atrocities worldwide is of great importance.
As college students, we are at the epicenter of global activism and cultural exchange. We should feel even more motivated to support America’s continued foreign involvement. We owe it to the world, to ourselves, to our economy and to our democratic influence.

War is not free. War destroys the lives of those that participate in it. Even those that stay home experience aftereffects that harm society for DECADES. Now is a good time to let civil wars in foreign nations happen without getting involved. Just because the USA spends the most on military hardware, doesn’t mean that it should fly around the globe flexing its military might. 
The USA is borrowing money from around the world to give it to different groups of citizens and foreigners. The USA is like a student that gets a credit card to buy meals for friends and potential friends. Eventually all that is left are lines of people wanting more and a big pile of debt.
War is not free; it is an investment. Take for example, the millions of dollars we spent on using Tomahawk missiles against Libya in aid of the rebels. That is going to now pay off with vital oil contracts for some of the most pure crude oil in the world now controlled by the rebels. Do not use the debt as cover for being against war; in reality you are a sissy pacifist and that’s all there is to it.
it’s scary how clueless this author is.. The Wall Street owned media propaganda is very powerfull..
When CNN, CBS, FOX News, and MSNBC tell you that the US is intervening in Libya for “humanatarain” reasons, they actually believe it.. ahahah
When they tell Assad in Syria is “slaughtering” civilians they believe it.. 
The reality is quite the opposite it but  no need to ge in there.. Adolf Hitler in is hell somewhere looking up on the US propaganda mechanism and dying of jealousy.
Obama is selling wars with much clever propaganda than George Bush even though the policies are actually the same.
This is a thoughtful and well written piece. One of the other things that should be promoted is consistency and fairness. It is not right that the sabers are rattled in regards to Iran and its nuclear program (a signer of the NPT), but no mention is made of Israel’s nuclear weapons. In the State of the Union message, President Obama mentions the pursuit of freedom for peoples across the globe, but no mention of Palestinians is made.

We are facing dire times in America. With war in Afghanistan and potential nuclear proliferation in Iran, our government has its hands full, and our coffers are depleted of funds. Multiple lower-scale conflicts are escalating around the world, and they have generated debate regarding U.S. foreign involvement.
Instead of continually getting entangled in foreign conflicts, we must elect a president who will focus on nation-building in America.
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
The civil unrest, violence and poverty pervading foreign regions is staggering, and it is difficult not to advocate extensive foreign aid to ameliorate the situation. The amount of conflict, however, makes this task impossible.
We can decide who lives by committing our resources and manpower to certain foreign efforts, and we can decide who dies by ignoring equally disturbing situations.
Take our involvement in the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi’s authoritarian regime in Libya last year. Humanitarian interests were a significant justification for our air strikes and associated expenditures. A little bit south of this oil-rich nation, meanwhile, young African children were being forced to join the rebel Lord’s Resistance Army of child soldiers and to commit atrocious acts of violence against remote villages. Needless to say, there were no serious efforts made by the United States on this front.
We cannot continue to pick and choose humanitarian operations when the nations we get involved in pose no threat to American national security. The federal debt is more than $15 trillion, and unemployment is at 8.3 percent; we do not have the money or resources to spare.
By extricating ourselves from complicated situations in foreign countries and by using our resources to fix equally complicated domestic issues, we can work our way to economic recovery and improved living conditions in our own nation.
Addressing foreign crises on a national level is unrealistic. Individual action, however, makes sense.
The best thing we can do is to use our position as students in an elite collegiate community to draw attention to foreign crises from the grassroots level. This strategy has the potential to aid humanitarian causes and to raise money without increasing costs for everyone. Trojans can join plenty of student groups in this pursuit, such as Invisible Children, Global Medical Brigades, Students for Justice in Palestine and SC Students for Israel.
The sad truth is that human nature renders conflict inevitable in every corner of the world. It will never be stopped regardless of how many troops we send or how much money we spend. Voting for a president who will focus more energy on and allocate more resources toward fixing the many problems in our own country is vital.
Otherwise, we can expect post-graduation America to be continuously war-ridden. And we will foot the bill.

Sarah, Sarah. Sarah..
Ghadaffi did NOT attack civilians, that was the propaganda in the US media to get the people accept a military inervention.. HE sent the Libyan army to confront the CIA backed mercenaries that were attacking military compounds and civilians but through clever media manipulation those can be blamed on Ghadaffi.
Thank you for this piece. I hope one day the US returns to leading by example rather than continue to operate in the manner of US exceptionalism.

I think you’ll find that Obama did commit troops to the search for Joseph Kony. 
Just a little fact-correction.

This week, Lady Gaga has unveiled sensitive details concerning her upcoming Born This Way Ball, an international tour that will span over the globe. On her official website, Gaga describes the Born This Way Ball as “an electro-metal pop-opera; the tale of the beginning, the genesis of the kingdom of fame. How we were birthed and how we will die celebrating.
Sure, it sounds over-the-top, but does anyone expect anything less from the Mother Monster?
Gaga has reached for the stars with her upcoming tour, as shown by the sketch of the stage design she released on February 7th. The sketch depicts a monumental and highly detailed castle that includes a catwalk that will stretch into the audience. In addition to the elaborate stage, some of the little monsters will find themselves cheering for Lady Gaga in an area called the Monster Pit. Gaga worked on the stage conception for months and like her Monster Ball tour, which was complete with its own theme, the Born This Way Ball will have its own as well.
In addition to the revealed stage design, on Feb. 8th, Gaga released the first 11 tour dates on her official website. The first concert will be held in Seoul, South Korea on Apr. 27th, and will kick off the entire tour, which will extend all the way into 2013. The following 10 shows will take place at venues in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, New Zealand and Australia, but Lady Gaga fans who live in countries and continents aside from the aforementioned have nothing to fear since the Born This Way tour will ultimately consist of 110 worldwide shows, hitting both old and new places.
Gaga will perform a number of shows in regions she has never performed in before such as Southeast Asia and South America. And for little monsters at USC, there’s little doubt she will return to Los Angeles.
