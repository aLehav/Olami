Its iconic characters and rides have beckoned millions and earned it the nickname of the “Happiest Place on Earth,” but part of Disney’s magic lies in more than its most prominent attractions. John Boudreau, a professor of management and organization at the Marshall School of Business and research director at the USC Marshall Center for Effective Organizations, discovered this while studying the value of work as a professor at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations in the 1990s. 
As part of his research, he examined street sweepers at Disney theme parks. Boudreau saw that once the staff met a certain standard, cleanliness did not create much payoff for Disney. Instead, Disney benefited more when sweepers “created magic” in their encounters with guests, such as answering questions for them or drawing a Mickey Mouse figure on the sidewalk. These ideas, which stayed with him for the next 20 years, encouraged Boudreau to think about jobs and work differently.
“Even back then, what we found was that, if you take a job like a sweeper at a Disney theme park, you can’t really see the value of that work if you keep it at the job level because sweepers clean, but cleaning doesn’t necessarily pay off,” Boudreau said. “We realized that to talk about work with workers, you almost have to be able to say things like ‘Look, get good enough at cleaning, but don’t keep getting better and better at that. Instead, switch over and get better and better at serving guests.”
Boudreau’s recent book and Wall Street Journal bestseller, “Work Without Jobs,” published in March, explores a new work operating system where traditional jobs are deconstructed to meet business challenges, such as accelerating automation and new work arrangements.
“Almost all HR systems are built around the idea of jobs, job holders and degrees. Most policymakers talk about creating great jobs when they think about work,” Boudreau said. “We propose that the new operating system would allow the parts of the job to melt or deconstruct and live on their own. A job would be made up of tasks or projects, and you’d allow those tasks and projects to become free-flowing in a way and not necessarily need to be packaged into the job.”
Boudreau co-authored the book with Ravin Jesuthasan, senior partner and global leader for transformation services at asset management firm Mercer. The pair started discussing writing “Work Without Jobs” in 2018 and had worked together several times on previous books, including “Lead the Work” and “Reinventing Jobs.”
“Lead the Work” highlighted how gig workers and contractors could be combined with full-time employees to optimally complete tasks constituting traditional jobs. “Reinventing Jobs” focused on automation working alongside humans, rather than neatly replacing multifaceted jobs as usually imagined. 
“That progression naturally led [Jesuthasan] and me to realize that this idea of deconstructing jobs is fundamental to many, many challenges that are going to start facing organizations,” Boudreau said.
In early 2019, Boudreau and Jesuthasan put together a proposal for “Work Without Jobs: for publishers,” which was happily accepted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology press. They worked on the book for the rest of the year and continued to revise it in 2020. 
“As we’ve worked on the four books, we have steadily grown to be more in sync with each other,” Jesuthasan said. “[Boudreau] brings such a rich theoretical perspective and a clear sense of the architectures that are required to power work, and I bring to bear the sort of practical dimension of working with companies to apply the ideas that we’ve developed, testing them, seeing the results and then being able to write about those examples with [Boudreau].”
Having worked together since 2005, Boudreau and Jesuthasan have developed a reliable workflow. However, the coronavirus pandemic forced them to adapt their process. Normally, Boudreau and Jesuthasan would meet up in places such as Chicago, Santa Fe or Los Angeles, but this time, they only had a chance to brainstorm for the book face to face in February 2020.
“Then, we literally collaborated remotely for the entire book writing process,” Jesuthasan said. “As we learned more, we would go back and retool a lot of things more so than we’ve done with previous books. So [the pandemic] just introduced some additional complications.”
The pandemic brought uncertainty but also significance to the content of “Work Without Jobs.” As workers shifted from an office to a home environment, they had to rethink and adapt their jobs. Work was also changing for some people remaining on site who traded in making auto parts for making ventilators, or making whiskey for making hand sanitizer, Boudreau said. 
“During early 2020, we often found ourselves asking, ‘Gee, I wonder if anyone will want to read about these COVID examples, or will this thing just pass?’” Boudreau said. “Well, it turned out, of course, COVID was a much more major issue, and those examples stayed in the book.”
“Work Without Jobs” presents several case studies of businesses reinventing their work operating systems. In one case, prior experience in generating innovative solutions to workforce issues empowered Providence, a healthcare organization, to meet challenges brought on by the pandemic. 
The book illuminates the new future of work and offers practical recommendations for organizations to adapt for it. Jennifer Sparks, director of corporate relations & executive education at USC Marshall Center for Effective Organizations, has read several books by Boudreau and found “Work Without Jobs” similarly impactful.
“John’s books are thought-provoking and a must-read for senior executives and HR leaders wanting to transform their organizations,” Sparks said. 
Sparks first started working with Boudreau during her time in the marketing department at Marshall and currently works with him in USC Marshall Center for Effective Organizations, which provides business leaders with research and insights to design organizational performance. Sparks helps connect and facilitate conversations between clients and researchers like Boudreau. 
“He’s incredibly engaging,” Sparks said. “He’s provocative. He’s a thought leader that really encourages executives to think differently and to unlock new thinking to evolve for the future.”
Boudreau said “Work Without Jobs” also holds actionable insights for new talent such as university students. 
“Think of yourself as a complete set of capabilities,” Boudreau said. “So rather than defining yourself as whether or not you’re qualified for a certain job or career, I think increasingly, it’s going to be helpful to think of all the capabilities that you have, and all the capabilities that you might build.”

By the time ze was in junior high school, Thornton School of Music and Kaufman School of Dance Dean Robert Cutietta, who had grown up in a very musical family, knew that for zim, “it was all music.” Cutietta said ze didn’t have much going for zim except for music, which became zir driving passion, zir decided path. 
The University awarded Cutietta the Presidential Medallion — the highest honor USC bestows upon its employees — to commemorate zir 20 years as dean. Cutietta was honored alongside Chair of the President’s Working Group on Sustainability Education and Research Dan Mazmanian and Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman at the University’s 41st annual Academic Honors Convocation April 19. 
Robert Cutietta
After finding zir place playing music professionally, Cutietta began a part-time job teaching musical theory and was shocked by how much ze enjoyed it. The experience served as a “turning point” for Cutietta and launched zir decades long love affair with music education, which led to zir 2002 appointment as the dean of the Thornton School. All zir contributions to the University’s music and dance programs, Cutietta said, were a “labor of love.”
“I’m honored. It’s wonderful to be recognized for something that you do. Everything I did was because I believe in it,” said Cutietta, who will step down from zir position in June. “I really just did what I loved doing and was passionate about and then I got a medal for it. So, how cool is that?”
During Cutietta’s time as dean, the Thornton School introduced new degrees in arts journalism, music education, visual and performing arts studies, choral music, vocal jazz and popular music. The school also expanded its physical space by 40%, which included new rehearsal and practice areas, as well as renovated homes for film scoring, student services, jazz and film scoring. Five new endowed faculty chairs and one professorship were added in addition to tens of millions of dollars in new scholarships, among other forms of student funding. The Kaufman School, USC’s first new school in 41 years, was established in 2014 and underwent the 59,000 square foot construction of the Kaufman International Dance Center.
“I really am adamant that I want to leave both schools really in great shape for the next deans. I want to literally hand it to them on a silver platter because schools like this should be leaders,” Cutietta said. “It’s time for somebody else to come in with a new vision and build on this.”
Following zir parting from USC, Cutietta will be a Scholar in Residence at the Albert & Elaine Borchard Foundation and will pen a book about the pandemic’s effects on music education while living in Paris, France. Cutietta’s work will serve to compare virtual teaching modalities employed by Thornton and those used by the Paris Conservatory.
Dr. Sarah Van Orman
From the first advisory message alerting the USC community of the “Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)” to 10,000 community coronavirus cases and more than one million tests conducted, USC Student Health, headed by Van Orman, has directed the University’s response to the pandemic. 
Coming to USC in 2017 after serving as executive director of university health services at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she served since 2008, Van Orman led the charge amid the unprecedented, sometimes overwhelming and “nonstop” work to contain and adapt to the pandemic. Van Orman’s Presidential Medal recognizes her leadership and contributions to student health and safety at USC, prepandemic and now. 
“Many of us feel like it’s been a privilege to get to lead during really historic times for public health,” Van Orman said. “Many of us feel proud of the work that we’ve been able to do on our campuses. We’ve been able to keep our campus safe, minimize the spread of disease and contribute, in a way, to public health in the community.”
Working to curb the spread of coronavirus on campus underscored the value of partnership and collaboration for Student Health, Van Orman said, and she adapted her leadership style to “orchestrate the pieces” necessary for the vast and ever-changing demands of the University’s response. 
“To survive something like this … it was about the team at Student Health,” Van Orman said. “[As a leader], your job is not to necessarily know everything or make all the decisions or do everything.”
As someone who community members looked to for guidance during the pandemic, Van Orman said the uncertainty she — and health professionals around the world — faced in understanding and responding to the pandemic proved difficult. Comforting ill and exposed faculty, staff and students through health advice to relieve their worries has been one of the most gratifying aspects of her time as chief student health officer over the past two years, Van Orman said.
With public health measures returning to a semblance of a postpandemic world, Van Orman said the tasks ahead are less exhausting, though still uncertain, and Student Health is refocusing its efforts onto additional public health matters.  
“We’re returning to some of those other big health issues … [such as the] growing challenges with mental health, the impacts of gender-based violence and other forms of sexual violence and issues around diversity and inclusion,” Van Orman said. “Those are all issues that we think actually got exacerbated by the pandemic.”
Dan Mazmanian
As a young man, Mazmanian spent his summers in the High Sierras, admiring the Californian beaches and natural treasures — but knew there was harm coming. The global climate crisis became a part of his consciousness back then, leading him to focus his research on sustainability policy as a graduate student in the 1970s during the wind-up of the environmental movement. 
Mazmanian has written about environmental sustainability ever since and began to participate in policy-making forums, eventually making his way to tenure as a professor of public policy at the Sol Price School of Public Policy and a faculty fellow at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Institute of State and Global Policy. In 2019, when Mazmanian had originally planned to retire, President Carol Folt appointed Mazmanian as chair of the President’s Working Group on Sustainability, a position in which he has spearheaded the collaborative efforts of students, employees and stakeholders in paving the University’s way toward sustainable operation and growth. 
The most fruitful part of planning and teaching sustainable practices at USC, Mazmanian said, has been the excitement he witnessed among students who see the existential threat of the climate crisis and are frustrated, frightened and curious about how they can affect change through policies, both in their communities and on a grander scale.
After three years of leading what he called the “coalition of the willing,” Mazmanian will retire from his work at USC. Come May 16, Mazmanian said, he’ll sit down and think about what comes next for him. The Presidential Medal, he said, symbolizes the University’s prioritization of environmental action and recognition of the community built around sustainability since the conception of the Working Group. Mazmanian said he accepts the medal “on behalf of all of us” who have worked to further the University’s sustainability viability and vision. 
“I’m proud of what we have achieved. This, in a sense, is the culmination of my time at USC,” Mazmanian said. “Now we are transforming the physical nature of our campus — it’s all blossoming — and that’s going to take many more years, so I thought it would be an appropriate time for me, individually, to say thank goodness and fight on.”

The school year is coming to an end. You have worked hard and gone through some of the most unusual circumstances in your academic life, but like any last stretch of the semester, finals and assignments pile up, which suddenly makes you want to clean the bathroom sink or find the best study songs and end up making a whole playlist. But no worries; here are some long or slow-paced movies for your study breaks that can put you in the mindset ready to work. 
“Drive My Car” (2021), 2 hr 59 min, HBO Max
With a running time of a whopping two hours and 59 minutes, Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s “Drive My Car” follows Yûsuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima) as he directs stage actors while he finds answers to his life after recent and old losses through his friendship with his chauffeur, Misaki Watari (Tôko Miura). As implied in the title, the movie mostly takes place in the car where the characters talk or drive. While the movie involves beautiful day and night shots of Japan’s highways and roads, it is also a delight to see the parallels and changes in the relationship between characters through where the characters sit.
Another interesting element of “Drive My Car” is Hamaguchi’s directing style. The script reading scenes where the actors emotionlessly read the script parallel the actual table read that Hamaguchi does with his actors, which he believes brings out impulsive reactions from the actors when they shoot on camera. Hamaguchi’s practice makes the chemistry and emotions between the actors in “Drive My Car” more relatable as it assimilates the audience with Yûsuke and Misaki’s persevering attitude toward their life.
“The Batman” (2022), 2 hr 56 min, HBO Max
One of the most anticipated films in 2022 has finally landed on HBO Max. From Fellow Trojan Matt Reeves, “The Batman” takes place one to two years after Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) acquired his secret identity as the Batman. Ironically, the film beautifully portrays the crime-ridden city of Gotham in a modern, yet antiqued, style of design that evokes a sensation of noir that fits perfectly with the mystery detective movie. Although recent films involving Batman have been associated with action and fancy gadgetry, “The Batman” goes back to its roots in Detective Comics as Batman battles with the mysterious killer that threatens the city he protects. Although he continues to spread fear to the criminals who plague Gotham, Batman begins to doubt if his work is making any difference.  But he keeps on fighting and pushes himself forward, similar to college students in the last stretch of the semester.
“Blade Runner 2049” (2017), 2 hr 43 min HBO Max
“Blade Runner 2049” by Denis Villeneuve is a sequel to an older acclaimed Hollywood classic, “Blade Runner” by Ridley Scott. While expanding the universe from the original movie, Denis Villeneuve’s vision in “Blade Runner 2049” makes the film a science fiction masterpiece. The synth music adds a futuristic, yet sympathetic sensation that enhances the experience of finding hope among the despairs of the dystopian world. Additionally, the visuals in the movie are a feast for the eyes; any still shot of the movie, even of a junkyard, is like a painting.
What makes “Blade Runner 2049” a good movie is its story. The film delivers a captivating narrative about the hope and despair of Officer K (Ryan Gosling), who hunts replicants, bioengineered humans, as a replicant himself. From excitement to apathy, Officer K goes through a roller coaster of emotions to learn how to make a difference when the world surrounding him does not see him as the main character. “Blade Runner 2049” will get you ready to give your all as assignments and finals pile up in front of you.
“First Cow” (2019), 2 hr 1 min, Hulu
With a relatively shorter running time compared to other movies on the list, you will wish Kelly Reichardt’s “First Cow” would never end once you start. “First Cow” follow the friendship between Cookie (John Magaro) and King-Lu (Orion Lee) as they open a bakery business in the Oregon territory in the 1820s. While this may sound like another western with lone wolves and dry desert, “First Cow” is by no means a common western movie. Rather, the film focuses on kinship and the damp forest of Oregon. With the aspect ratio of 4:3, Cookie and King-Lu appear close to each other on the screen, which makes the audience feel happy about their small and big fortunes during the day and nervous about their risks at night.
Although the movie mostly focuses on the relationship between Cookie and King-Lu, another key relationship on-screen is the one between Cookie and the cow. Both longing for something that they have been missing in their life, the conversation that Cookie has with the cow sounds as if they are bonding through shared loss. The friendship and the unique portrayal of the wild west in the Oregon forest will put you in the mood to grab a study partner and get to work.
Short and fast paced films are exciting and less time-consuming. But slow paced and long movies create an everlasting impact that one cannot simply experience in short movies. It feels like we have spent a lifetime with the characters, going through emotions and experiences that we do not normally go through in our fast-paced world. These movies will let you take a break and recharge from the fast paced reality of finals.

With the passing of Earth Week, sustainability is on everyone’s mind. Throughout April, I was inundated with ads, infographics and reminders of ways to reduce my carbon footprint. While we, as individuals, do not have as much of an effect on climate change as big corporations do, we still find ourselves doing what we can to have a positive impact on our planet. 
On TikTok, #sustainable has 1.8 billion views, with creators sharing their best tips and tricks on how to start sustainable habits. From reducing food waste to planting a garden, I have found myself swapping these rituals into my daily routine. 
As college students, we are usually buying groceries for one person, which means that we often don’t get to eat food fast enough and end up having to throw away food that goes bad. Yes, composting is an option, but even then, you feel a bit guilty throwing away food before you get to it. 
Shelbi Storme (@shelbizleee) has built a brand on “(attempting to) make sustainability fun across the internet.” Her video on how to store food to avoid waste is a game changer when it comes to fruits and vegetables.
Storme suggests storing greens in a container with a napkin or towel on top to absorb moisture. When it comes to potatoes, they should be stored in a cool, dry place to avoid quick rotting. Carrots, which are notorious for going limp, should be chopped up, added to a jar and submerged in water to keep them crunchy. 
Love cooking in the oven, but hate the mess? CNN’s product review TikTok, @cnnunderscored, has got you covered.
Tin foil, parchment paper and other single use items can be switched for nonstick, silicone divider trays that allow you to bake multiple things at once. There’s no need to wait for one thing to cook before switching the baking sheet; if your items take different times to cook, you can remove the trays as you please. When you’re done cooking, the trays can be thrown right into the dishwasher.
Similarly, the account @brightly.eco shared reusable alternatives that can be used instead of single-use products. Nonstick silicone muffin molds are a great alternative to disposable cupcake liners. Dryer balls are a substitute for dryer sheets that get tossed out after drying a load of laundry. If you love packing snacks in Ziploc bags, it’s time to switch to reusable silicone storage bags that are even sturdier and can be washed and reused. 
However, preventing climate change and helping the planet is more than just converting to reusable products; we also have to think about our environment and natural resources.
Redleaf Ranch’s (@redleafranch) account has great gardening lessons to help connect with not only Mother Nature, but with ourselves. Even though not everyone is blessed with a green thumb, these videos can help even the worst of gardeners gain one. 
For instance, one way to make your gardening experience easier while also helping nature thrive is by planting native plants. Plants that are native to your environment will attract native wildlife and native pollinators, while also being a lot less invasive and a lot less work. 
These plants are used to the climate conditions of the area and were built for them. They will make your garden beautiful and allow for native wildlife to do its thing for the environment. It’s a win-win.
You don’t have to plant a garden to show that you care about the environment. Doing the small things can help us create habits that will break the cycle of carelessness toward climate change.
Yes, it can be hard to make these changes when big corporations and politicians are the ones who have a bigger impact on the environment. However, grassroots change can be the catalyst for even larger change. 
Not all of us will become completely sustainable overnight, but hopefully these TikTok videos will show us where to start.

Well, welcome to my 30-for-DT. 
Genuinely, I feel like I should not be writing this. I think I’m still that sophomore from March 2020. I can see myself leaving my GE in Taper Hall, looking at my phone as I walk down Trousdale and receiving that email. I’m Han Solo in carbonite. I should build upon that joke, but I’m tired after all the unprecedented events. Although I see them all the time in history, this one feels defining.
I will always wish that I had been at University Park more instead of my “campus” where I spent Zoom University. I wish I hadn’t been a transfer with only one semester at USC when the pandemic hit. I wish I hadn’t been a commuter weighing just how long of a drive the social engagement was worth. I wish I could have narrowly dodged more skateboards and surreptitiously cried in more corridors. I wish I had taken more pictures. I’ve had my best and worst moments here (and online). I’ve embarrassed myself, bit my tongue a thousand times and wished to fall through the floor — at this point, it’s a special skill on my resume. 
I could wax poetic to you about my time at USC — my abbreviated time and my extraordinary time here. The times that I fell in love with campus all over again at golden hour. But that isn’t what this column is about, right? It’s about books and honestly, it landed me here.
I remember the Passover Seder when I was nine-years-old. My aunt handed me a book as a “just because” gift when I walked in the door. I finished it in the hour before the seder began, and from then on, my reputation for reading quickly became apparent. Everyone soon knew that I was in love with stories in every form.
When I was young, I loved the “Rainbow Magic” series, the “All of a Kind Family” series, but it was the “Junie B. Jones” series that made me the reader I am today. And, of course, as I mentioned in my first column of this semester, Percy Jackson & Co. is responsible for at least half of why I am so annoying about books. 
As I grew older, I began to worship the young adult section — the books known for “I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding.” No one wanted to accompany me to the bookstore, and they still don’t, but I had a $10 bill in my pocket, and I needed to make an informed decision about paperbacks! My local indie routinely forked over backlist books which led to, among others, a collection of series about teenagers who, upon falling asleep, end up in Disney World as holograms to fight Disney villains. I loved “The Raven Boys.” My reading speed was once again a hallmark, and I suppose most people would prefer to leave high school with being prom king, but “That Girl That Read a Lot of Books Very Quickly” is perfectly fine too.
I wanted to spotlight “The Opposite of Loneliness,” which I discovered as a sophomore in high school. I had picked it out by chance through Goodreads, obviously my social media of choice. It was a series of works by Marina Keegan who died in an accident just days after she graduated. After her death, her graduation speech went viral. The way she described her college experience with so much love made me realize I wanted to be — and write — like her. She’s right on every single count: The notion that it is too late to do anything is comical. The idea of losing the circles we make during our university years is terrifying. The beauty of everyone being on the same team, behind on the same reading, in the same city. The late-night texts of “Wanna come with? Please?” The tenderness of the small moments that you hold onto. The walks from here to there and back again.
For me, USC was never a slam dunk. I never believed it could happen and still believe the acceptance letter was a dream. I’d see people on tours taking photos and think, “Wait, wait, wait, I go here. They think it’s something worth taking a photo of. This is my school.”
It is the pride of taking a photo with Tommy Trojan as a prospective student and realizing that you will pass it each day and not take the same photo until graduation. It makes me tongue-twisted and flustered. It’s why I’ve been digging my heels in the sand this semester and fighting waves of premature nostalgia. The entire thing was everything and nothing I’d hoped for, in this emotional gray space. 
I started at USC terrified, and now I’m leaving with a bit more joy. A little bit more in love with Los Angeles, and a little bit more in awe of those I’ve met. It’s strange the sort of beauty you’re able to find in the unprecedented events. 
I’m lucky to have been a history major and to “hear the people sing” — those never heard and the long dead. I’ll miss spending class time going on long soliloquies about my history obsession du jour and wondering what happened in the missing 18 and a half minutes of the Watergate tapes. I’ll miss working on this column, though it was hardly work. For me, USC was all the literary genres wrapped up into one. So, if you saw me trip over my own feet on Trousdale or at Taper, SOS and CPA at least once a week throughout my time on campus — no, you didn’t. USC, thank you for having me. Fight on forever — and please … read a book today.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual violence.
The Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, USC Flow, Survivor Support Community, Callisto and Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment joined Explain the Asterisk’s nationwide campaign for a campuswide walkout against sexual violence at USC in commemoration of Denim Day. Students demanded accountability, transparency and concrete action against rape culture at the University during Wednesday’s walkout. 
Denim Day has been celebrated on the last Wednesday of April for the past 23 years in solidarity with sexual assault victims. In 1998, the Italian Supreme Court overturned a rape conviction, ruling that because the victim’s jeans were too tight, she must have helped remove them, indicating consent. The next day, the women of the Italian Parliament wore jeans to work in support of the victim.
Starting in front of Bovard Auditorium, students marched to USC Village before making their way to 28th St. to sit on the lawn of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity house — which is currently on interim suspension for assault allegations. There, representatives of USC Flow and SSC led discussions on the Interfraternity Council’s accountability.
“We are here today because for far too long, the pervasive problem of sexual assault at USC has gone on unobstructed and enabled by systemic inaction and violence,” SSC president Sammie Sorsby-Jones said. “We are here today to bring dialogue to where there was once silence, to bring light to what has been shrouded in darkness for far too long. We are here today to make lasting change because we all deserve so much better.” 
The walk’s participating organizations published their list of demands earlier this week for University administration, the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils, Department of Public Safety, faculty, staff and students. Demands focused on greater transparency and accountability in response to sexual assault allegations, increasing the number of professionals trained in dealing with trauma victims and mandatory in-person sexual harassment and bystander intervention training for all students.
“We have yet to receive what will change in regards to safety from sexual violence for students,” USC Flow cofounder and president Natalia Parraz said. “This begins with not only the structure of the university, but what behavior students decide is okay and what’s not okay. That’s why our demands are targeted not only at Title IX and the administration, but at IFC and the student body. Nothing will change unless [we] decide it’s gonna change.”
Part of the organizations’ administrative demands include greater accessibility to the resources the University has for sexual assault survivors. Sorsby-Jones described the process of seeking help from the University as “bureaucratic” because resources are hard to find, which adds a layer of difficulty to survivors’ healing processes as they have to relay their trauma to multiple offices. 
“It’s unreasonable to expect survivors to be able to endure that on top of everything they’ve already endured,” Sorsby-Jones said. “We should be doing everything that we can to hold the perpetrators accountable, not at the cost of the survivor.”
Elle de los Reyes, a representative for PAVE, said some services, such as Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention, must be more trauma-informed. After she had a strong reaction regarding difficult decisions in her case, RSVP staff advised her to calm down because otherwise she would no longer be provided services. 
“We can’t be expected to just take [bad news] without any sort of reaction, and there needs to be more understanding,” de los Reyes said. 
Referencing last October’s protests demanding justice after multiple reports of sexual harassment and drugging occurred at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house, students emphasized the importance of consistently demanding University action instead of stopping once the topic is no longer popular. Students also brought attention to the importance of fellow students showing solidarity toward victims. This includes not associating with known abusers, not being a bystander when violence is taking place and speaking out if an act of violence is committed. 
“We watched as weeks passed and the brief campus reckoning abated and then things went back to normal,” said SSC vice president Yi-Ann Li. “The topic of sexual assault at USC stopped being trendy. The truth is there is no ‘back to normal’ for survivors. Our pain is not a trend or a brief stop of a performative action.”
Portions of the walkout were filmed for a documentary by Nice for What Movement, an organization that focuses on ensuring accountability by encouraging sexual violence survivors to share their stories. The documentary, funded by USC Visions and Voices, has been filming since the October protest and has included other Sexual Assault Awareness Month events hosted by the University.
“The goal is to hold USC [administration] accountable for what they’ve put survivors through during our time here at school and to hopefully inspire change and also emphasize the intersection between healing and advocacy that a lot of survivors have found themselves in,” de los Reyes said.
Ultimately, students want to see an end to the culture of protection that the University has with fraternities, aggressors and staff. Even when victims report their abuse, they may have issues with Title IX staff which are then usually ignored, Sorsby-Jones said.
“When I really think about it, there’s plenty of solidarity, just not with survivors,” Sorsby-Jones said.

“Soulful and emotive” are the two words that USC singer-songwriter and producer Jane Honor would use to describe her music. On Friday, Honor will release her debut album, “Spiraling In Central Park,” following the success of her first few singles.
Just 21-years-old, Honor, a junior majoring in music industry, already knows who she is as an artist. “Spiraling In Central Park” maintains a cohesive sound in its eight tracks, and its production highlights Honor’s soft vocals and ethereal head voice. 
Album track “My Body” encapsulates the project’s tone. The ballad’s production is built around a slow piano riff and crescendos at its bridge, while its chorus becomes anthemic, “It’s my body and I want it back / Yeah, I hate it but it sure loves you.” 
For Honor, “My Body” is one of the most important songs on “Spiraling In Central Park” and features some of her most introspective lyrics. Its streaming proceeds will be donated to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, an organization cofounded by her biggest musical inspiration, Tori Amos, a ’90s alternative rock artist. 
“She’s a woman that talks about a lot of hard topics, and she’s also a keyboard player,” Honor said. “She taught me that girls can be in rock music and girls in rock can play piano.”
Honor’s passion for music started long before she began recording. Before she fell in love with Amos’ music, she performed in her first musical at just eight years old.
“A lot of the songs that I was learning for theater, I would try to come up with little ways to change them or change the lyrics or the melodies to make them sound better to me,” Honor said. “That eventually led to one of my teachers being like, ‘You should write songs.’”
For Honor, it was the pandemic that spurred her artistry and inspired her to make her own music. Her first songwriting class at USC assigned homework every week. Here, Honor became more comfortable with herself as a songwriter and with sharing her work with professors, classes and peers. 
“Things really kicked off when the pandemic hit because I felt like I had gained all these songwriting skills and could actually apply them on my own time,“ Honor said. “So I spent the lockdown writing and also recording most of this album.” 
Honor said she got lucky with the success of her July 2021 single “There Won’t Be Any Music” and its performance on streaming platforms. The single’s success, in part due to the Public Relations firm TREND that Honor works with, caught the eye of Alethea Freidberg, social chair and member of the A&R team for 840 West, USC’s student-run record label. 
“840 does a lot more of the marketing for the USC circle and then TREND PR also helps as well,” Freidberg said. “The combination of both 840 and TREND really have helped her get good playlist placements and really helped get Jane’s numbers to be where they are today.” 
According to Freidberg, playlisting in the streaming age has become more and more important, especially for someone taking an alternative route to what has become more and more popular — post on TikTok and hope your music career takes off from there. 
840 also provides their artists access to INgrooves, a site designed to provide independent artists audience insight and listening trends. According to 840 West President Jack Mangikyan, “The data that they give is remarkable. It’s more data than Spotify For Artists can give, and it gives artists a lot of information as to how their songs are doing.”
“For artists, it’s giving them an avenue of distribution that they could trust and also transparency, which every single artist, no matter how big or small, should have access to a very transparent distribution network,” Mangikyan said. “As for the team itself, having the ability to work in a team-like setting, working together and getting that experience as well.”
Honor’s single “Melt” was the first song released with 840’s help. 
“[Working with 840] is such a great learning experience because you really don’t think of everything that needs to get done until you have a whole team of people thinking about everything that needs to get done,” Honor said. “I’ve definitely just learned for myself how to manage my workload and make sure that I actually check off all these steps that I maybe didn’t think were so important but actually are.”
Through working with 840 and taking classes for her music industry major, Honor began prepping for a career in songwriting outside of USC. Though she is working with 840 to promote her music, Honor is not signed in any official capacity and looks to continue to release music independent of major labels. 
“I’ve learned about how the industry works and how being an independent artist works and how you can get people’s attention being an independent artist,” she said. 
Along with her album release, Honor is recording new music and already has a four-song EP planned for  release Fall 2023. Though this time, she will veer away from the indie, pop-rock sound on “Spiraling In Central Park” and include more dynamic vocals and production with more dramatics and theater, Honor said. 
In the future, Honor said she wants to write and produce more, letting her own music take a back seat. 
“I love writing for other artists and collaborating with people and really being on that creative side,” Honor said. “I would like to stay independent and just grow gradually. My goal has never been to be famous. I would just like to make music and get enough to maintain a stable living.”

As silly as it sounds, if there’s one last thing I could do before I graduate, it would be to visit Fluor Tower’s sixth floor one more time. 
It was home to El Sol y La Luna, USC’s special interest Latinx community floor— where I lived my freshman year. But now, everytime I pass by the building, which will be completely demolished shortly after commencement in May, my heart breaks.
I unsurface at least one memory everytime I look at it, from taking care of drunk people in my suite’s small living room to my first surprise birthday party. Since the internal demolition has already begun, all that remains now of the home that hosted these memories are structural beams and walls. 
The building’s emptiness feels uncanny. When I look at it, it feels like someone has scooped my heart out. I want to tell passersbys who are confused about the construction that inside this empty building is where I learned who I was and who I could be. 
Fluor was my home, and I don’t say this for sentimentality’s sake, but because as a first-generation college student who fretted about the transition to college, El Sol y La Luna provided me with the comfort I needed. 
I sang along to “Mi Burrito Sabanero” with my suitemates during the holiday season. I had late-night discussions about the pressures that came with attending university and all that my parents had sacrificed to get me to USC. I shared bits of my grief, and I found that each time I opened up, there was a receiving hand on the opposite end who understood the nuances of my experiences.
While I know the community has relocated to another residential building, there is a piece of me that sees Fluor Tower as an extension of 17-going-on-18-year-old Angie who cared desperately for a place where all parts of her were validated.
When I’ve heard white women project womanhood as a monolith of experiences, I wince. Personally, I don’t want to be equated with that. Given my brown skin, native language, immigration experience, my culture, my heritage and the way my mom raised me, I am deeply uncomfortable with comparing my experience as a woman under violent systems of oppression with that of a white woman.
At the end of the day, my suite and I understood each other. We knew what it meant to be Latinas, and how that would manifest itself under a society that hypersexualizes and stereotypes us as “feisty” and “strong.” We could share our experiences with machismo, our love for our cultures and our appreciation for one another. 
Unfortunately, Fluor Tower also symbolized the larger meaning of what it means to be non-white at a predominantely white university. When the building flooded in October 2019 due to a fire sprinkler set off on the sixth floor, racist rhetoric spread on social media with messages such as ,“You can’t make tamales at 3 a.m. and then forget to turn off the microwave.”
The University did little to support those students facing discrimination, especially when such racist language targeted a safe space that students viewed as a home on campus. Even then, the only people who shared outrage at the racism were people of color. There was no white allyship or greater message sent on behalf of University administration about it. 
When I set off to write this column, I wanted to reach the Latinx community but also anyone who had ever felt as if their identities were underrepresented at USC. Taking up space in the Daily Trojan and writing about my experiences felt liberating and reassuring, especially after four years of bottling my emotions to only a shared group of people.
Before, the only space I knew to take was in the community I had built at Fluor, but now I realize that my voice needs to be amplified, if only to make someone out there — whoever you are — feel less alone. If I have done that, then I have accomplished one of the guiding principles of my journalistic integrity.
I’ve spent much of my USC experience identifying objects with milestones.
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism represented the beginning and death of my imposter syndrome — remember, sometimes you’ll find out that the people who the institutions have been historically designed to benefit will just turn out to be incredibly uninspiring. 
Seeley G. Mudd building’s rooftop symbolized how cool you were if you snuck up there, but also when you looked out, how beautiful Los Angeles was. The Daily Trojan newsroom is where my news judgment as a journalist was sharpened and where I learned about the potential of a newspaper’s platform. The Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International Affairs was where I saw the Guatemalan flag during summer orientation and where my parents took a photo of me before publishing it on Facebook.
And Fluor Tower is about freshman Angie who had no idea what the next couple of years had in store for her. All she really knew is that her parents had worked too hard for her to do badly in college, that she’d go with her friends to the McCarthy Dining Hall if the ravioli bar was on the menu and that she was unsure how someone like her could ever make a mark at USC. 
I want to tell her that I’m proud of her. And congratulations, we did it.

For the past two years, the Daily Trojan has surveyed staff on personal identities and demographics with the intention of creating transparency on who works at the publication and to show our growth and shortcomings, both internally and externally. In our fourth diversity report, we also decided to release the report later in the semester in an effort to focus on other diversity and inclusion initiatives. In the past, this has included expanding the liaison team, hosting workshops and reaching out to cultural organizations during recruitment at the beginning of the year. We intend to continue releasing the report in hopes of expanding what the section focuses on.
Because this information is collected through survey data, results rely on the honesty of responses. That being said, it is important to acknowledge that this survey does not account for all members of the newspaper but only those comfortable in choosing to respond. We at the Daily Trojan feel it is important to think critically about the ways in which the various identities of our staff affect the content that we write and produce. It is our hope that transparency with the larger USC community will help us better identify the ways that which our staff can improve. 
Methodology 
To conduct the report, we asked all Daily Trojan staffers to self-report their racial and ethnic backgrounds, gender identity, sexuality, student status (international, domestic), languages spoken at home, and record of disability. 
Out of 350 total staffers, we received 243 responses — approximately 69% participation.
Analysis
Looking at the report, we found that the bulk of respondents identify as a cisgender women, making up 64% of staffers — with 29% of staff identifying as cisgender men. The remaining staffers fell across the gender spectrum, ranging from trans men and women to gender nonconforming. 
The bulk of our respondents identified as freshman students (37.0%), followed by sophomore (35.4%), junior (19.8%), senior (6.2%) and graduate students (1.6%), respectively. 
In terms of the racial and ethnic backgrounds of Daily Trojan staff, the majority of respondents identified as white, making up 37.0% of the data we received. East Asian students made up approximately 28.4%. Hispanic and Latinx identifying students made up about 18.1% of the information we received. Black students made up 5.3% of our respondents. In comparison to last semester, our staff demographics has remained relatively consistent.
In regards to sexual orientation, the vast majority of our respondents identified as straight (66.3%), while 33.7% of students identified as either lesbian (3.3%), gay (4.1%), bisexual (10.7%), pansexual (1.2%), asexual (0.4%), queer (7.0%), questioning (2.9%) or preferred not to state (4.1%). It is important to note that for many, sexuality is oftentimes fluid, and thus it is possible that continuing staff who previously identified one way now identify differently. 
According to USC’s published facts and figures of 2021-22, out of a total student population of 49,500 students, about 24% of USC students identify themselves as international. At the Daily Trojan, only 8.2% of staffers identified as international students. The majority of our staff is fluent in English, but we found that a wide variety of our respondents spoke more than one language, some even more than two. Languages spoken by our staff include Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, Bahasa, and Haitian Creole. 
The last facet of identity that our survey looked at was a record of disability. The vast majority of students at the Daily Trojan identified as not having/not having a record of a disability (81.1%); 12.62% of students stated that they have a disability or a record of one — a slight increase compared to last semester’s 11.23% — while 6.6% of respondents preferred not to state. 
The managing and masthead sections make up the Daily Trojan’s editors, managing team, and other leadership positions. This semester, 30.3% of the masthead is white compared to managing 0%. About 60% of mastheads are cis women and managing the number is 50%. Finally, 50% of the masthead is straight and 33.33% of the managing is straight.
Concluding thoughts  
The goal of the Daily Trojan is to create an inclusive environment for all students that USC represents. We hope to further think about the ways in which we can encourage more involvement and participation in the newspaper. We acknowledge there is no sole truth. We understand that objectifying knowledge in that way fails to account for the various nuances of lived experience. 
In regards to future initiatives, the one of the main goals of the publication is to look at this report and previous shortcomings and address those early on through diversity workshops and , recruitment strategies and reaching out to community organizations on campus. The latter has been a goal for the past two years and was only minimally explored, something that needs to improve in the future. 
The second goal is to use the semester more effectively when it comes to diversity and inclusion. Releasing the report later in the semester will also provide the diversity and inclusion section with more time to host workshops and other initiatives.
It is important to note that when recruiting staff for the Daily Trojan, these identifiers are not factors in decision-making; however, our staff should depict the wide range of experiences at USC, including that of marginalized communities. This data can work to serve as a marker for areas within which we need to improve.

When Jesse Walk made his way through the involvement fair his freshman year, he expected to come across a table for a “Star Wars” club.
But it didn’t exist. 
When he searched again his sophomore year, he also found nothing. The pandemic disrupted his junior year, and when he tried one more time his senior year, Walk still found nothing. 
Now a senior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, Walk did, however, come across Sydney Loew, another senior in his cohort. Loew’s table for her other club, Haute Magazine, looked different from the rest, prompting Walk to ask her why that was. 
“She’s like, ‘Oh, the club fair organizers wouldn’t give us a table, so I brought my own table.’ And then just like that, boom, the idea struck,” Walk said. “I literally said, ‘Sydney, tomorrow, we’re bringing our own table, and we’re starting ‘Star Wars’ club.’”
Overnight, the duo, who now serve as the club’s co-presidents, created posters and planned their vision. They promised big ideas to the 150 people who signed up, such as streaming the films in the Norris Cinema Theater and at USC’s off-campus Michelle and Kevin Douglas IMAX theater, located in the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts.
However, booking the venues came with more red tape than expected. 
“We thought it would just be easy. We’ll just email the cinema people, ‘Hey, can we book the Norris?’ And they’ll be like ‘Yeah, sure.’ But it was not that easy,” Walk said.
The club first had to become a registered student organization, and in order to book the Norris Cinema Theater, it had to become a registered cinema club. However, another hurdle was thrown their way when their application was denied due to the club’s nature being “too niche,” Walk said. 
Their motivation couldn’t be deterred. Their rationale is that “Star Wars” remains essential to the University given the school’s connection to filmmakers, including alumnus and “Star Wars” creator George Lucas, whom a building is named after at the School of Cinematic Arts. 
“No one in our generation has seen the original movies from the ‘70s and ‘80s on a giant screen,” Walk said. “It’s always been on a small computer screen or a television, so that was the whole driving force.”
The duo pivoted to Alex Ago, the director of programming and special projects at the School of Cinematic Arts, for guidance. Ago jumped in to assist the organization because he believed that “it was a perfect time for us to put ‘Star Wars’ back on the big screen.”
“There’s a generation of students here now that have never had the opportunity to see ‘Star Wars’ on the big screen, and I know what that’s meant to me and what it’s meant to students in the past,” Ago said. “It’s part of the identity of the school. A lot of students here over the years have come to study at USC because of our long standing relationship with Lucasfilm.”
The club has screened “Star Wars” films such as “Rogue One,” “A New Hope,” “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi.” Currently, the “Star Wars” club is preparing for its big May 4 event, where club members will celebrate with “Star Wars” themed food before watching “Revenge of the Sith” in the IMAX theater.
The screenings also include appearances from guests who worked directly on the films, such as Academy Award winner and visual effects artist on “A New Hope” Richard Edlund, David Weitzner who marketed the “Star Wars” franchise for the first time and creative executive at Lucasfilm story group Matt Martin.
“Not only do you get to watch on the big screen, you get to talk to the people that made the movies and people that work at Lucasfilm nowadays,” Walk said. “Sydney and I do the moderating for the Q&A, so we get to go up on the stage and talk to them in front of the crowd which has been a dream.”
A mix of people who are dedicated “Star Wars” enthusiasts and those who are just being introduced to the fandom’s lore attend the screenings.
“Something we figured out along the way is there’s quite a few people who have just never seen ‘Star Wars,’ and we became their avenue to watch them in the way they were intended to be seen in the first place,” Loew said.
Amelia Anello, a sophomore majoring in sound design, has been attending the club’s events since it began its smaller screenings in Taper Hall. For Anello, being in the club has meant having a space where she could talk about her shared interests with other passionate members. Anello also helps draft the trivia questions for the club’s non-screening meetings, which occur Wednesday nights in Taper Hall.
“The weekly meetings are fun, because they’re much smaller,” Anello said. “It’s where I’ve met the most people and where I’ve made lasting friendships, because the meeting will end and then there’s 10 of us that’ll stay and keep talking for a while, whether that’s in the classroom or because we end up getting kicked out and then talking outside of the classroom.”
Even though the club faced numerous challenges in the beginning, Loew and Walk are proud of how far they have come with the original vision they had planned.
“It’s just that love of ‘Star Wars’ that has gotten us from noes to yeses,” Loew said, “But we were able to persevere because of all the people who love ‘Star Wars,’ and it’s just been mind-blowing to see what that power does.”

Welcome to the final installment of “Triple Bottom Line.” It’s been two years of biweekly articles, and honestly, I’m burnt out. There’s nothing quite like writing about the impending doom of the planet as we know it to take the wind out of your sails. 
I’ve been brainstorming for weeks, trying to think of one final message for anyone out there who may be reading this. The truth is, if I had the answers, there wouldn’t be a need for this column in the first place. 
One of the very first lessons you’ll learn in any environmental crash course is the tragedy of the commons. It’s a classic economic paradigm that sums up the climate crisis in a nutshell — when individuals have access to a shared resource, they act in their own interest, often at the expense of others, resulting in overconsumption and consequent depletion of the public good. 
While this is a common climate phenomenon — depleting nonrenewable fuel sources and overfishing far beyond a sustainable rate, to name a few examples — it also emphasizes the human-centric lens with which we interpret the decimation of our home. We’ve historically considered the climate capitalistically rather than holistically, determining what’s worth saving from our own path of destruction based on its value to us. 
In fact, our collective response to climate change has been a tragedy of the commons in its own right. The climate movement is constantly caught between the two camps of individual and collective action. Individual actions are seen as proverbial drops in the ocean while collective action is regarded as unattainable, systemic change. However, the scale is not so straightforward; if individual action for a better climate isn’t taken, then we’ll never build up the momentum needed for collective action. 
Recycling feels understandably futile when just 100 companies account for 71% of global emissions. The climate crisis is so incomprehensibly broad that it naturally gets whittled down into smaller, more attainable goals and actions. While there’s importance in being individually intentional, we shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger picture. We need to embrace our individual power and our limitations, coming together to demand systemic change from corporations, government and society as a whole. As antithetical as it may seem, prioritizing the common good of society as a whole is in our best interest in the long term. It is the only way to truly ensure the prosperity of the Earth for years to come.
While poor governance is a primary cause of the tragedy of the commons, we should start by reconsidering the connections between humanity and nature. Both the overuse of ecosystem provisions and the lack of accountability when it comes to fighting climate change need to be reevaluated as well as what incentives we have to protect the planet besides what physical goods it can offer us. The human race and nature aren’t separate entities; from our own living gut microbiomes to our reliance on photosynthetic processes to grow the food we need to survive, at our core we’re just one branch on the tree of life.
There’s only so much human manipulation that can be done to increase our food supply, maintain species that should’ve gone extinct thanks to our inhospitable industrialization or block rising tides from inundating our sprawling developments. To frame it in the way to which we’re so accustomed, it’s simply not cost effective to keep maximizing profit from nature while simultaneously destabilizing earth systems. 
There are so many things that the natural world provides us with beyond what can be quantified in barrels of oil extracted, land deforested or in dollars and cents. Earth is the only home that we have — the value is arguably priceless. 
For the past two years, I’ve leveraged my innate skills as a hater to critique the world and systems under which we live, but I’m also a proponent of the power of measured optimism. 
As dire as things may seem, the combination of individual and collective action still offers a way to envision a less disastrous future than advertised in the media. We’re slowly starting to turn the tide and redefine what it means to be a part of a global community; countries such as Chile and Bhutan have set a new standard by incorporating ecological resilience into their constitutions. In fact, Bhutan measures national progress not by GDP but by a gross national happiness index that prioritizes human and ecological wellbeing.
This is the end of “Triple Bottom Line,” but it’s just the beginning of what I hope will be an impactful career in climate communication. Thank you to the Daily Trojan for giving me a platform to rant, learn and grow. I’ve discovered so much about the intersectionality of climate change through all of the topics I’ve covered, and most importantly, found my voice. 
I encourage anyone reading to explore your own connection with nature and, as discouraging as it may seem sometimes, remember that individual actions have the power to catalyze into greater progress. While breaking free of our self-serving pursuits is a collective task in itself, I urge you to consider your personal relationship with the environment and your reasons for fighting to protect it. Changing our attitudes and behavior when it comes to climate change is an achievable — albeit uphill — battle, but don’t forget to appreciate the beauty of the world along the way.

It’s time for me to put this whole thing — the “Back in my Day” and “The Carpool Lane” shenanigans — to rest. Even in writing this, I have made peace with moving on from the publication which has given me a home for the last three years. 
Every night after the newspaper gets sent off to the printer, I sling on my backpack and trudge over to the elevator in the Student Union building. Usually tired and somewhat irritable, I hop, skip and jump to my car, Bess. 
It’s a scenario that I commit to night after night, a sort of decorum that I have talked about in this column up until I start my car. Even after Bess starts humming, as I look at the light pollution skewing the brightness of the night sky, that procedure remains at play. 
The drive, one that I could do easily without my glasses and wrap up in half the time that my GPS recommends to me, recently turned into more of a weird spiritual journey. Despite always being sobered by the reality of the dreaded 8 a.m. the next day, I always manage to tear up passing a specific piece on the road, often to the point where I need to pull over and just bawl my eyes out.
Yet, interestingly enough, that spot is not the hospital I was born at, nor is it my high school or that one music school where I kept getting my ass whooped by other piano students. Instead, it’s much simpler. 
When I enter the freeway on ramp near Vermont Avenue, I come to a cruising speed at around 60 or 70 mph. As I blitz my way past Normandie, Western and Arlington before reconnecting with the 10, there sits a chunk of plastic, concrete and metal that separates the shoulder lanes from the actual freeway. 
Night after night, the yellow and black stripes that adorn its metal face stare me down, illuminated only by Bess’ lights. It glares at me, and I glare back, knowing that it may be the only escape from the often hellish day-to-day schedule that slowly tears my sanity away. 
At 1 a.m., I may just be the only car on the road — a feeling of isolation comparable to when I roll out of bed and back into it when I simply cannot face the new day. It’s feeling of loneliness and solitude that consumes and ever so gently nudges me to simply let the wheel slip from my hands. Here, I’m presented with an alternative option at this fork in the road, one that does not choose either path but rather one that goes between them — now at 70 mph. 
But it’s a sudden and incredibly sharp reel of thoughts that awakens me and sends shocks through my arms, into my hands and pulls the wheel one way or another. 
In that reel are images of my close family and friends, moments of accomplishment — such as passing my first chemistry exam and driving to school for the first time — and the Daily Trojan newsroom.
I spend an unholy amount of time there, something I’ve been trying to work on lately. Regardless, having equal amounts of time in a workplace and at home should mean you enjoy the gig, right? Well, it’s a bit complicated — like most of my relationships are. 
But, as many fellow columnists and editors wrap up their time at DT, a few messages ring true. I am honored and privileged to have my rants, trauma dumps and smartassery run under the facade of a column in this paper —the home  of much more important and relevant pieces of journalism for over a century. There are many things that I wish I had done differently, more considerately. I apologize to those who I’ve wronged in my time here and express an incredible amount of gratitude to those who contribute to the spark that keeps me around after the nighttime commute. 
I have found a great deal of joy in rummaging through different layout options, editing and fact-checking articles and just spending time with friends who value what this publication stands for. I can only ask of myself to be better as I move into my final semester at USC and continue to fight every night — or probably just switch freeway onramps, to be honest.
I hope whoever’s words take up the space I once had in the newspaper makes a definitive change in the community, regardless of the size. Who knows, maybe another gero kid will pick up where I left off. I just hope they have their previous romantic relationships in better order.
When I become older and reminisce as I am doing now, I’ll be able to say that, “Back in my day, I was a part of something bigger than myself” and then rant about how easy kids have it compared to my 1 a.m. drives on the freeway.
So, as I sign off one last time, I intend on fighting the good fight that is my wacky evening commute. Remember to cherish every inch of happiness that comes your way. Always drive safe, besties.

USC lacrosse will host UC Davis Saturday for its last regular-season match before the Pac-12 Tournament. This game will also mark senior day, honoring eight USC seniors, graduate students and fifth-year players on the team. 
The No. 17 Trojans will celebrate seniors Kaleigh Brennan, Michaela McMahon, Katie Ramsay and Finley Ueland, alongside graduate students Elyse Darcy, Kelsey Huff, Maggie Root and Lizzy Wagner in pregame activities. 
Assistant Coach Asa Goldstock described the group of eight’s impact on the team.
“They’ve all contributed in a tremendous amount of ways, whether it be what they do on the field or off the field,” Goldstock said. “They really contributed to our team culture. They’ve really developed and worked hard to create this culture that we have been so successful with this year.” 
Last week, the Trojans earned the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament after defeating Pac-12 opponents Oregon and No. 23 Arizona State. Both USC and No. 1 seed Stanford will have a bye for the first round of games. 
Before the Trojans compete for the Pac-12 title, they face UC Davis this weekend, whom they hold a 6-0 record against. The Trojans are 12-3 on the season with an 8-2 conference record. A win against the Aggies would end USC’s regular season on a 4-game win streak, the longest of the season.
UC Davis will have to keep an eye out for a lot of Trojans this weekend, especially recent Pac-12 Players of the Week redshirt freshman attacker Isabelle Vitale and senior defender Kaleigh Brennan. 
“We just try to focus on us,” Vitale said. “We take it day by day every practice and just mentally and physically getting our bodies ready for Saturday.” 
Other key contributors for USC include junior attacker Ella Heaney, who has 31 goals and 17 assists this season, and senior midfielder Katie Ramsay, who has snagged 52 draw controls and 12 goals this season. 
As for UC Davis, the Trojans will need a game plan to stop freshman attacker Grace Gebhardt, who had 5 goals, 3 assists and 7 draw controls in the Aggies’ last match against San Diego State. Another threat will be freshman midfielder Ella Brislin, who racked in 4 goals and 6 draw controls in that match. 
Following Saturday’s game, the Trojans will have less than a week to prepare for their first match in Tempe, Ariz. in the Pac-12 Tournament. USC will face the winner of No. 3 seed Arizona State and No. 6 seed UC Berkeley. 
Goldstock said securing the bye was valuable for the team’s mentality. 
“The girls worked really hard to get there,” Goldstock said. “It is great for them as a little confidence boost getting ready for this weekend.”
The Trojans will play UC Davis Saturday at 1 p.m. at Soni McAllister Field.

We have many privileges as students at the prestigious University of Southern California. 
But there’s one privilege you may not realize that we have: the privilege of calling the most unique catcher in baseball one of our alumni. 
Garrett Stubbs is unlike any catcher you’ve ever seen. 
Attentive Trojan baseball fans were clued into this during Stubbs’s senior season at USC in 2015. All of his traditional hitting stats were amazing. He ranked fifth in the Pac-12 with a .346 batting average, fourth in on base percentage at .435, fifth in runs (51) and seventh in doubles (15). 
But the traditional, expected stats are besides the point. What set Stubbs apart that season were his stolen base and sacrifice hit totals. Stubbs was second in the Pac-12 with a whopping 27 steals and tied for the league lead with 17 sacrifice bunts. 
Both of these remarkable stats showcase skills that catchers are not expected to be good at. 
First, it’s remarkable to think that Stubbs was the best hitter on the team, and yet, he was unselfish and skilled enough to lead the Pac-12 in sacrifice bunts, which enormously helped the rest of the Trojans convert their offensive opportunities. 
In addition, catchers tend to be slower than the average MLB player because of the toll that squatting takes on their knees and legs. Plus, catcher is the most difficult position to play physically and mentally. Catchers need to practice their defensive skills more than other positions, which leads to less proficiency at skills such as baserunning. 
Always an anomaly, Stubbs was able to become an elite baserunner despite the demands of his position.  
In no way did that come at the expense of his catching skills. 
Stubbs was as good as it gets behind the dish, throwing out 52.8% of potential base stealers and making only three errors in 468 chances. 
How good are those numbers?
Good enough to win Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year. 
Awards committees across the country noticed Stubbs’ numbers as well. He even won the Johnny Bench Award as the best catcher in college baseball. 
Somehow, the MLB regarded college baseball’s best catcher as only the 229th best player in his draft class. The Houston Astros made him the 229th overall pick in the eighth round of the MLB draft.
Nevertheless, Stubbs has been working ever since his draft day to prove his worth as a player, and when he has gotten an opportunity, he has been fun to watch. 
If anything, Stubbs proved he was more unique as a pro than in college. He has developed to play outfield now as well, which is totally out of the ordinary for catchers. Most catchers can only play first base if they play the field at all, but Stubbs has gone above and beyond that. 
In general, Stubbs has filled an incredible amount of different roles in his young major league career. He has appeared as a catcher, left fielder, right fielder, pinch hitter and, most remarkably, a pinch runner in his MLB career. Stubbs had the highest sprint speed of American league catchers in 2019 and 2021. 
Stubbs has also maintained his elite defense, throwing out 41% of potential base stealers in his pro career and four out of nine would be base stealers in his major league time. 
Despite all of this, he never carved out a regular role on the Astros. He spent 2019-2021 shuttling back and forth between the minors and majors, never sticking around long. 
Luckily, another team recognized his value and knew they could snag him from the Astros. The Philadelphia Phillies traded for Stubbs this past offseason to make him their backup catcher. 
It seems that in Philadelphia, Stubbs has finally found a more permanent MLB home. He made the 2022 opening day roster and has shined in his opportunities so far this season, boasting a .400 batting average so far. 
While Stubbs might not be the youngest or flashiest up and coming player in baseball, he certainly is one of the most unique. He possesses a range of skills that few, if any, other players in the majors have.
Next time you are checking the stats of your favorite players, or you’re looking for an MLB game to watch, check in on Garrett Stubbs. He simply does a lot of things at a high level on a baseball field, and high-level baseball is beautiful to watch. 
Plus, he’s going to be battling it out in a red helmet and catcher’s gear similar to a suit of armor. It doesn’t get more Trojan than that.

The energy pops out when you walk into Flower Street Barbers. Everything is strategic in the setup — from the placement of the TVs to the barring hip-hop music bouncing off the walls.
Look up above the TV to the left and see Drake London’s jersey. On the right is Drake Jackson’s jersey. Take a seat in the small, black, high-density memory foam chair, and you’re in one of the most popular seats around — the same spot USC football Head Coach Lincoln Riley got his first Los Angeles haircut. But, this isn’t going to be your average midskin fade or buzz cut.
It’s something different for Peter “42” Hernandez. He wants to learn about you. He wants to find a way to connect and understand your story. 
When Riley sat in his chair, Hernandez didn’t want to know about his playbook or what it was like to coach former Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield. 
“I wanted to know him personally. Like ‘Yo, what did you drive in high school? How many blocks did you walk to go to your nearest liquor store?’” Hernandez said. “‘What did you have to go through to do that?’”
Even though he’s the go-to barber for USC athletes and some may call him a “celebrity barber,” that doesn’t define who Hernandez is. 
His journey as USC’s favorite athlete barber began with the community around him. That’s what matters most.
“I don’t just cut the football team, I don’t just cut the basketball team, I have to start with the community first,” Hernandez said. “Because without the community, I can’t get to you.”
“I’m confident. I’m doing this”
As a kid growing up in Santa Barbara in the 1990s, Hernandez described himself as a “crash dummy.” His brothers and sisters would put him outside in certain situations and wonder how he would act. 
It was through them that he learned traits that manifested in being a successful barber. His sisters taught him how to talk to people the right way, being shown how to use words to substitute actions. His brothers taught him how to run a business properly through hands-on experience. Being around his brothers left Hernandez wondering why people continued to choose them for a haircut, prompting him to dig deeper into the business.
Years before Hernandez even had clippers in his hands, graffiti spray cans were his go-to. For him, it was a way to release his emotions into art. 
He took graffiti as a bigger challenge for himself. Hernandez wanted people to recognize him for his work.
“I was always ready to do the biggest, widest, most colorful spot, right in your face because I wanted a challenge,” he said. “Every time I went out, it was a challenge for me to get people to know my name without knowing who I was.”
Hernandez became known for his graffiti, receiving frequent compliments. He would play them off, emphasizing instead that becoming good didn’t come easy. 
At times, Hernandez had to wait to see who had extra paint laying around just to do graffiti. 
“That’s how motivated I was to make sure that whatever I was doing in front of me was at the top tier of what I could do and no room for any less,” Hernandez said. 
That’s a mantra Hernandez carries with him today. As he got into his late teens, cutting hair became more frequent. 
He always hung out at his brothers’ barbershop — the hair clippers gravitating toward his hands like a magnet. But his brothers left for barber school right when he got his own clippers.
It created a problem. Hernandez only wanted his brothers to cut his hair, so he resorted to doing it himself.  
“I started cutting my own hair and I’ll tell you this, man, it wasn’t easy. Nothing’s easy,” Hernandez said. “And, if you like it, it becomes easier to do because your confidence starts to grow. You don’t really care about the judgmental parts of it.”
Finding out how to escape the judgment of cutting his own hair was an obstacle. Embarrassed, Hernandez wore hats because he didn’t want people to see his messed up hair.
Moments such as these sculpted Hernandez into who he is today. One day, though, he grew tired of walking around with a hat on. He threw it off and walked with his chin up, confident in his own skin and prompting people to ask where he got his hair cut.
“That’s how confident I was. I was already showing people, ‘Look at the next step that I’m at,’” he said. “I’m confident. I’m doing this. I’m running. And so, that’s when people started reaching out to me.” 
For better or for worse, more people began asking Hernandez for haircuts. But in turn, he started to meet people from different high schools and struggled to stay in school.
“It was kind of like a blessing in disguise because if I didn’t have [that early experience cutting hair], then I wouldn’t have been around so many different people to know where I needed to belong, and what I needed to provide,” Hernandez said.
Providing something towers everything else for him. It comes from his upbringing. 
Brotherly love
Adopted into a family that already had six children of their own, Hernandez believes his adopted family didn’t need to take him on as a two-month-old. 
That’s always inspired him to give something back to the community and motivated him to make all the time his family spent teaching him worth it.
“I tell myself every day … I have to provide for the community,” he said. “Because if I don’t, then the time that I spent with my family, them showing me right from wrong, in my [mind], I would be a waste.”
To ensure that wouldn’t happen, Hernandez began learning from his brothers, Cesar and Eric. 
When Cesar moved to a barbershop in Santa Barbara, Peter blossomed into a more confident person. He would sweep floors, answer the phone and handle appointments, paving the way for Peter to become someone you could talk to. 
While working with Cesar, Peter started to take note of customers feeling down and attempted to cheer them up. It inspired him to be open to every single person no matter their background.
“There’s a lot of places that will turn you around because of a language barrier,” Peter said. “But I had to make sure that if I ever wanted something for myself, like my brother did, having a lot of people coming in and out, everybody’s welcome.”
Becoming USC’s most well-known barber 
It was Peter’s second year at Flower Street and things were slow. His coworker expected people to come in and out, but no one even knew the barbershop existed, Peter said, so he made a friendly bet with his coworker. 
He would go outside and pass out his business cards, come back and then have his coworker do the same thing. Just like Cesar and Eric would test him, Peter was testing his people skills.
As Peter entered Ono Hawaiian Barbeque on Figueroa, it was just him and a 6-foot-2 defensive tackle inside. Peter told him about the shop, handed his business card and said, “If you ever need a barber, or your guy can’t do it, come and see me.”
Thirty minutes later, then-USC player Malik Dorton gave him a call and got his haircut an hour after. Peter’s cut wow’d Dorton.
“Malik feels like ‘Damn, this is my first time seeing you, you don’t even know anything about me, and I feel like we know each other because you cut my hair to the tee,’” Peter said. 
The dominoes soon fell into place for Peter. He found a confidence that he didn’t know he had. That confidence in approaching Dorton built over time and finally paid off.
Word started trickling through the team about this barber “42” on Flower, and the rest is history. If you look through Peter’s Instagram, it’s almost every player seen on a USC court or field. 
Peter single-handedly built his shop on Flower too. He would finish his day’s work, drive to Home Depot and put as many supplies as he could fit into his car. 
From the barbering stations to the electricity of the store, even if it took three days, he was on YouTube trying to figure it out.
It’s that mentality that’s added to why he’s a favorite among Trojan athletes. His confidence and desire to connect with others and push them to be great are always evident.
Senior wide receiver John Jackson III, who met 42 through a friend, went as far as to call Peter a brother to him and “nothing but a blessing.” 
“He’s a good dude, and it’s nice being able to talk to somebody about just the small things that happen in life,” he said. 
For Alabama transfer linebacker Shane Lee, Peter was the person who helped him learn some spots around the city when he first arrived. Lee saw Peter at a bookstore, and the barber proceeded to share everything Lee needed to know about L.A. 
His conversational skills differ from other barbers. He wants to hear about you but also about how you’re improving and pushing yourself to be better. It’s more about lessons off the field than it is on the field when he talks to you. The conversations stand out too. 
“[What stands out is] just conversating, having a good conversation not just about football but about life,” sophomore wide receiver Kyron Ware-Hudson said. “Telling us how to be a great person.” 
Sometimes when a customer is having a bad day, Peter even goes past their appointment time, allowing them to tell him everything they need to get off their chest.
That’s what it’s all about at the end of the day for Peter. 
“I’d rather have all the relationships and connections with people over having all the money that can buy whatever it is,” he said.
