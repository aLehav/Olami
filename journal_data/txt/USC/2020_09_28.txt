If you can remember that far back, when we used to go to the movies, a new box office year was just beginning, which means the biggest question on Hollywood’s mind was likely: “Will the box office continue on its slow, sure, decline? Will the power of streaming sites only continue to grow, pushing people out of theaters? ” If you would’ve asked me, sitting at a theater for the last time this year watching “The Invisible Man,” I would’ve told you I think this is going to be a solid year for going to the movies. I would’ve argued my point with upcoming blockbusters such as “Black Widow,” “Tenet,” “No Time to Die” and “Dune” — people won’t wait for these movies to be streaming, they’ll have to go to the theater! 
You could call what happened in the contest between streaming services and movie theaters a bit unjust — a sickness that requires people to stay at home seems a bit unfair to the orthodox movie-going crowd. Of course, most would rather stay healthy than watch a movie in theaters, but I think that the argument for theater viewing was never about going to a building to watch a film; what a crowd represented to Spielberg, in his resistance to Netf lix films win-ning Best Picture, is really after is our attention. 
Watching a movie in a theater is not essential, but watching a movie with the attitude a theater fosters is vital. 
When AMC theaters reopened a few weeks ago, they put on a special one-day-only sale: Fifteen cent movie tickets celebrating 100 years of going to the mov-ies (“Movies in 2020 for 1920 prices”). Perhaps AMC was only desperate for customers to feel safe indoors once again, but their offer naively connected our time to the grandest movie-going era. The 1920s saw movie attendance skyrocket. Both working-class and middle-class theaters became important hubs for communities, either for socializing with friends or for displaying your affability at the “movie palace.” Movie theaters were significantly more im-portant 100 years ago than today, and theater chains are foolish to think they can ascend to that level of prominence again. 
Or maybe AMC wanted us to remember a time when going to the movies was essential because there was no better way to be entertained; or, even because the world was changing drastically and Hollywood was a huge part of that change. Whatever the case, an offer for 15-cent tickets only serves to remind us how far we’ve come from 1920, and for those of us who refuse the offer, how little movie theaters really mean to us. 
I have sincerely missed going to the movies, but not because I miss going out and paying $20 for a ticket; not because I miss having something to look forward to at the end of the week or always having that option with friends and family. I really miss going to the movies because of the kind of “viewing ethic” the theater fostered — the building, the lighting, the sound; all of it tells us to pay attention to the movie and only the movie. I miss showtime. 
Watching movies at home has made me miss the dark room of a theater where what is on screen is my sole focus. I don’t have to belabor this point, we all know it’s much easier to get distracted working or studying from our laptops at home; I’ve had to watch films online for my cinema course, acutely aware about other things that call for my atten-tion. Watching a film in Norris Theatre, I would forget about everything else. That’s the kind of attention movies deserve. 
We won’t get back to movies for a while — even if all theaters open soon, we ought to be prudent, take it slow. Theaters themselves aren’t worth the risk (though an argument might be made for local, independent theaters). But, we should still keep in mind what theaters have taught us. How should we watch a movie? Most of us don’t have a big room where the lights dim and a projector blasts the image before us. Big screens and lights are designed to highlight the importance of the film itself. If we can consider movies that important without all the pageantry to assist us, if all we need for showtime is the movie itself, I think we’ll have learned something worth more than 15 cents.

Watching supposed stars like Pascal Siakam and Paul George self-destruct in the second round of the NBA Playoffs helped me pinpoint why I love playoff basketball so much. In the past, I thought my love came from things like NBA Twitter or a winning team’s locker room. But, thanks to Siakam’s meltdown and Playoff P being Playoff P, I realized what I love more than anything else about the playoffs is the clarity they provide. After a regular season filled with countless debates and controversial player rankings, the playoffs paint a definitive picture of who’s who.
I notice the same level of clarity in music when rappers release an album. Just as the regular season serves as a relatively low-stakes setting for players to shine, artists have relaxed periods of time between project releases to boost their hype. Standout features, successful singles and catchy Instagram Live snippets can push a lot of talented rappers into conversations they haven’t fully earned. Much like the playoffs, a full body of work tells the true story of who’s really a star. 
This column is dedicated to categorizing the best of the best in basketball and rap, and the best of the best can be broken down into five hierarchical tiers: budding stars, borderline stars, stars, superstars and megastars.
Budding stars and borderline stars are self-explanatory and almost identical to one another, with the only separating factors being age and experience. Of the five tiers, athletes and artists in these two classifications provide the most optimism due to the low pressure surrounding them and the assumption that the best has yet to come. Stars are the most common of the five, but they are also the most frustrating since they’re usually too good to demand much more from.
Superstars are rare, usually less than a dozen at one time, but they’re rarely in serious discussions of who’s the best. Those discussions are reserved for the artists and athletes who are so great their crowning as the best sounds cliche — these are the megastars. 
Megastars are easy to spot in the NBA: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Kawhi Leonard. See? Easy. They are the best of the best of the best, but by ranking so high, they operate under a constant microscope and continuously need to prove their ranking to avoid demotion. Any one of these four players instantly turns a team into a title contender. 
NBA superstars don’t possess this ability. Teams led by superstars usually exist in playoff purgatory for the superstar’s entire career, bouncing between first and second-round exits yearly with the occasional trip to the conference finals. Stars are the players that megastars and superstars push their teams to trade for. They’re usually referred to as “Pippens” or “Robins.” These are the Bradley Beals and Khris Middletons of the NBA. Budding and borderline stars are usually one year or an extra skill away from jumping to stardom or superstardom. Insert players like Brandon Ingram and Ja Morant.
The NBA Playoffs provides crystal clear pictures of which stars belong in each tier. For example, after only scoring more than 20 points once and shooting below 40% in a seven-game series, it’s clear Siakam belongs with the borderline stars instead of stars. Players such as Jayson Tatum and Bam Adebayo, on the other hand, have used the playoffs to build on their All-Star regular-season campaigns and solidify themselves as stars with potential room to climb to superstar status in the Eastern Conference Finals. 
Remember what I said about superstars only being able to lead a team to playoff purgatory? Well, players such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden and Damian Lillard are examples of that. All three are undeniably top-10 players that consistently fall short of the Finals. 
This isn’t an issue for megastars. With James making the Finals again this year, this will be the 10th straight season that at least one of the four previously mentioned NBA megastars are in the final round.
Much like in basketball, a rapper’s tier rank is dependent on performance and results, but unlike basketball, a rapper can’t be classified as a star without the results. 
Playoff wins in rap are album sales. This eliminates a lot of great artists from being labeled as stars. For example, Freddie Gibbs has arguably three classic rap albums under his belt, but with his highest first-week sales total being 30,000 units, it would be hard to argue Gibbs as a star. Similar to how Finals appearances and playoff series wins place a basketball player in certain tiers, album sales automatically place artists in one of the five tiers. The quality of the project determines if they rise or fall from there.
Lil Baby is the best example of how the rapper hierarchical tier works. His sophomore album, “My Turn,” is the first album to go double platinum in 2020 and is both the highest-selling and highest-streaming album of the year. Despite his first album arguably being his best work, the success of “My Turn” leveled up Lil Baby from a star to a superstar. If his next album is as high quality as the first two and produces the same record-breaking results as “My Turn,” Lil Baby will have another theoretical championship and become a rap megastar, joining names like Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J.Cole.
The tiers of music and sports provide clarity to fans, and that clarity is most clear when it matters most. So when James wins ring No. 4 or Drake stops the world with “Certified Lover Boy,” think about where they rank and how their performance solidified that.

The first time Jaya Hinton visited USC she was amazed by how happy everybody looked. Coming from a snowy east coast, the shining sun and California heat excited her. Growing up in Silver Spring, Maryland, USC had not been on Hinton’s radar until late in high school, but by a stroke of luck she found out she had applied by the merit scholarship deadline when she was notified of her acceptance in January. The very first college she visited, Hinton felt like USC was home. 
“People genuinely look happy here, even though they’re doing work,” said Hinton, a junior majoring in business administration. “They’re still outside soaking in the sun, they’re with other people. They’re still laughing and smiling, even though they’re probably also stressed out, and I appreciated that.” 
During her freshman year Hinton met some of her best friends and felt welcomed into the USC community while living on Somerville floor, a special interest residential community for Black students. Through football games, tailgates and spending time at the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, Hinton started meeting and getting to know as many people as possible. 
“I don’t think I’ll want to change anything about my first-year experience,” Hinton said. “Everything that happened was essential to my growth as a person, essential into coming into who I was as a leader and a student and growing into that role of adult, so I’m very happy with everything that happened my freshman year and all the decisions I made and the ups and the downs and everything.”  
Having found a community herself, Hinton said it was important for her to help other Black people on campus find a space where they belonged, which is why she decided to work for CBCSA and be involved with the Black Student Assembly, where she currently serves as the co-executive director. Aside from those roles, Hinton’s campus involvement includes being a student ambassador and core mentor for the applied leadership program at Marshall and working with admissions to recruit a more diverse student body. 
“You have to figure out ways to foster engagement and make people feel like they’re part of a community, especially when they’ve never been to campus or never met anyone on campus,” Hinton said. “[BSA has] meetings every week. We’ve been focusing on leaving time for speed friending, so essentially just putting people like two or three people into breakout rooms and giving them the chance to talk to each other and get to know each other.”
Hinton is also working with her team to make BSA inclusive and welcoming of intersectional identities such as students who are Black and LGBTQ+ and consulting members before making leadership decisions and publishing statements as an organization. The improved transparency, Hinton said, has allowed her to feel more confident about her decision making and leadership. Before calling for the resignation of former Undergraduate Student Government President Truman Fritz and Vice President Rose Ritch after claims of racial misconduct and complicity, for instance, BSA conducted a survey and reached out to members to gauge their opinions. 
“The only thing we can really do is work within our groups in our organization to make sure that everybody who fits under that umbrella of Black feels welcome, but then also promoting organizations that want more inclusivity and representation,” Hinton said. “So working with USG to make sure that we’re promoting their open positions more, but then also making sure that this year we added two intersectionality chairs to the BSA board to make sure that students who are Black and LGBTQ for example feel like they have a place in BSA, and that they don’t have to pick an identity but that they can feel both and they can belong in BSA.”
Coming in as a pre-med, African American studies major, Hinton decided to switch to business administration two weeks into her first business class freshman year after realizing it would be a better fit for her as someone who is articulate and good at administrative tasks, she said. Along the way, she met mentors like Theo Fowles, then assistant director for CBCSA, who hired her and introduced her to the Black community at USC and Stacy Geck, her professor for Communication Strategy in Business, who helped her realize business was the right choice by working with her outside of class on resumes and helping her apply for internships.
“It was interesting because after our semester together, [Hinton] and I still kept in contact,” said Geck, an associate professor of clinical communication. “She would ask me questions about her leadership roles … she wanted to find out how to get folks unified with the differences and how to bring them together. We had great conversations about personality and management,  self-management and self-reflection. And she’s one of those individuals even at her young age who is willing to reflectively step back, look, see, alter, modify, change and grow. Those are skill sets that sometimes take [a] lifetime to develop.”
Over time Geck said she has seen Hinton grow both as an individual and a leader. While Hinton had always been a unique classroom presence due to her outspoken, inquisitive nature, Geck said she has witnessed her taking on challenges and developing as a leader. 
“I’ve seen her become more comfortable with who she is … and I think it’s important to understand that she steps into roles and responsibilities that are sometimes bigger than she sees them initially to be, and she grows and rises to the occasion,” Geck said. “I’ve seen her develop her approachability and her style. I’ve also seen her develop her level of confidence and comfort in knowing what she knows rather than second guessing herself.” 
Hinton has also worked closely with the Black Alumni Association as a BAA scholar and mentee in the Legacy Through Leadership mentoring program. Tensie Taylor, associate director of BAA, said she was impressed with Hinton’s commitment to helping Black students find a community and ability to connect with people on a personal level. 
“Even if [Hinton] was across campus, if she saw me she would even wave or even run over and see me or we will run and meet halfway,” Taylor said. “That’s just the type of person that she is and I just treasure her dearly and professionally. It really speaks a lot when someone can be a leader in the public eye but then at the same time their leadership is who they are behind closed doors, because how she is as a leader is how she is with me personally.”
Since the shift to an online semester, Hinton’s biggest challenge has been maintaining a work-life balance with her academic xand leadership roles while being in the same place and managing an academic workload that includes 15 weeks of classes crammed into 12. By joining study groups in class that foster a sense of community and relying on her teammates at BSA, she said she has been able to get by. 
“I have an amazing team that I feel very good about delegating to so that’s been really important,” Hinton said. “Not taking on all of the work myself, but working with my co-director, working with our parliamentarian and our outreach chair and our unity chair and making sure that we’re not taking on more than we can handle. Not to say that I’m not extremely overwhelmed because I am, but it could be a lot worse if I didn’t have that team that I trust.”
Calvin Carmichael, co-director of BSA, knew Hinton a few months before they each started at USC. He said Hinton’s flexibility and communication during the online semester to prioritize BSA alongside her classes and returning home amazed him and made working together better.
“She is someone who is really supportive,” said Carmichael, a junior majoring in business of cinematic arts. “One thing I really like about working with Jaya is we make sure to check in with each other a lot. BSA is a very large organization and we support a lot of students, so it takes a lot out of us and that’s one thing we make sure we prioritize. Especially not within just ourselves but our e-board and our members … we put everyone’s well-being first.”
Throughout her time at USC, Hinton said she has grown from someone who would keep her dissenting opinions to herself to get along with everyone to someone who is confident in her ideas but able to remain open-minded. Former BSA co-director Mae Gates, who has known Hinton for three years, has noticed her growth. 
“I’ve definitely seen her transform into a phenomenal leader, and just overall a campus leader,” said Gates, a senior majoring in public policy. “When she first came to campus as a freshman she was great, but I think I’ve really seen her kind of grow out of her shell, grow into her confidence and her capabilities as a student, as a student leader … She is also able to help those around her grow into themselves as well.”
Hinton echoed the remarks of Abeer Tijani, another student leader who has spoken out about anti-Blackness at USC, about working to change the University because of how much she loves it. She added that it is important to stand by your beliefs and to continue working to make the University a better, more equitable campus, even when the administration’s actions are disappointing. 
“We work so hard to make USC a better place because we love it, not because we hate it,” Hinton said. “I think if we all operate under that mindset, you know we’re trying to improve it not necessarily destroy it then I think everything would be a lot more productive. So I am really happy that everyone is working so hard to advocate and to improve USC for those marginalized people because like I said before, we should be advocating for the little guy.”

The Pac-12 announced the resumption of football, basketball and winter sport seasons Thursday, setting the stage for the return of college athletics on the West Coast. 
When most other Power Five conferences began their football seasons in early September, the Pac-12 Conference remained on hold, and the future of its fall sports was widely unknown due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
To some USC football players, watching other teams play without any plan in place to play themselves was frustrating enough to compel them to act. Leaders within the football team organized a meeting where the players drafted a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom with a simple request: “Please, let us play.”
“I was watching the Packers game, I was watching NFL football [being played] … and I was just thinking to myself, you see all these games and we’re over here sitting on the couch,” junior wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown said in a virtual press conference following the Pac-12’s announcement of its return. “So I called [head coach Clay Helton] that Sunday, and I asked ‘What can we do as a team to try and possibly play the season?’”
On Thursday, the Trojans got what they had asked for: a season.
“Our team and our staff are extremely excited and appreciative for the opportunity to compete and to play the game that we love,” Helton said. “We’re very appreciative to the presidents and chancellors that showed the patience to be able to wait for an opportunity that provided the safest environment for our student-athletes.” 
The Pac-12 Conference cited three main reasons why it was deemed safe to resume play: an increase in coronavirus testing capabilities, decreases in local and national case numbers and decreased concern of cardiac issues as a result of the coronavirus. 
Football team practices are scheduled to start up Oct. 9, with a four-week training camp leading up to the start of the season Nov. 6. Staying fit during the postponement period was crucial for the players. 
“[I wanted] to take advantage of that time off,” sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis said. “To me, it seemed like an extra opportunity to further my care of my arm and my mechanics.” 
An abbreviated seven-game schedule for the regular season means teams looking to play for the Pac-12 Championship and potentially qualify for the College Football Playoff will not have much, if any, margin for error.
“With fewer opportunities, each game gets magnified,” Helton said. “You get six opportunities and half the games [of a normal season] to be able to present the best resume possible for postseason play.” 
Helton emphasized the importance of not overlooking games in such a compacted season. 
“Every game is critical and you have to approach each game like it’s a championship game, because it could cost you,” Helton said. “In this league, [with] how competitive it has been in the last decade that I’ve been in it, you better bring your A-game to this league or you’ll get your butt beat.” 
While both Slovis and St. Brown expressed their willingness to return to play, the decision is still up in the air for some players. Helton will announce which players will be available and which will opt out by Oct. 9, saying that he wants to respect their privacy until then.
“These are conversations that are being had with players and with [their] parents and families,” Helton said. “They’ll make great decisions for themselves either way, and we will be there to support them.” 
The conference also announced that fans will not be allowed at any athletic competitions through the end of the year, with a reevaluation set for January. 
With no fans in the stadiums during games, Helton said the Trojans must get a competitive advantage from their own sideline.
“It’s going to be different [without fans],” Helton said. “There’s going to be an extreme sense of urgency for players and coaches alike to … manufacture their own energy and to let it ripple through the team.” 
Regardless of the circumstances, it’s clear that Helton, Slovis, St. Brown and many others are ready to return to their sport. The conference is set to release the full schedule in the coming days.
“I think we’re all ready for a season and we’ve been preparing for the last two or so months,” St. Brown said. “So I’m ready to rock.”

In the age of a pandemic, many artists are left to find innovative methods that deliver quality performances to fans. Striking the perfect balance with virtual performances is a difficult task, but Gus Dapperton made a strong attempt this last Friday.
On Sept. 25, the bedroom-pop artist performed a virtual one-hour set in collaboration with ZeroSpace, an immersive art theatre located in Midtown Manhattan. According to their website, ZeroSpace is a “25,000 sqft immersive art playground showcasing a collection of large-scale installations from the world’s leading new-media artists.”
The experimental playground elevated the performance by hosting the psychedelic visuals that completed the show ambience Dapperton was going for. Maneuvering from the main stage to the other installations made for lively and animated sets that kept the at-home audience engaged.
Donning an outfit signature to Dapperton’s style, the New York artist started the set off with a melody of “Verdigris” and “Coax & Botany,” a bass-heavy, playful mixture of elements which let the at-home audience know what to expect with the set to come. 
As Dapperton danced on the shimmery, iridescent dance floor the audience followed him and his energetic high-kicks to each new location. Dapperton’s colorful persona channeled a captivating artistic presence. 
The set consisted of 14 songs, including early singles, “Moodna, Once with Grace” and “Ditch.” And since being released, Dapperton’s latest singles also made their highly anticipated live debuts. 
While at times the performance reached a plateau, the energy seemed to pick up with crowd favorites scattered throughout the set. Announcing the viral 2017 single “Prune, You Talk Funny” to the at-home audience, Dapperton deemed it a dance song. 
“Feel free to dance, if you would like to,” Dapperton said. “We will also be dancing here on stage.” 
During these involved sections, the energy of the band shined and the excitement was felt across the screen. The ensemble helped maintain the foundation, allowing Dapperton the freedom to add his own flair to the songs.
Throughout the set, a live chat box feature hosted fans rapid fire comments on the performance, fostering a sense of community that’s been lacking through these unprecedented times.
Midway through the set, before the start of “I’m Just Snacking,” Dapperton is in a new location, engulfed in an incandescent purple hue as a reflective pendant for projections to bounce off of. The variety of camera shots and visual transitions create a dimensional perspective for the viewer.
As the set began to wind down, the focus of the camera was directed solely toward Dapperton and his acoustic guitar. The zeroed-in attention to the artist shifted the focus on the extravagant production, and asked viewers to reflect during the final moments of the set, which paired well with the sincerity of the final songs.
The most recent “Bluebird” single was matched with impressive red visuals that featured the off-beat typography of this album cycle. Followed by “First Aid,” the sophisticated songwriting came across with the slowed pace.
Closing the set was the second single of this album cycle, “Post Humorous,” which was the showstopper. The rough, gritty vocal deliver from Dapperton paired well with the cutting lyrics such as, “And if I was the only thing you couldn’t bear to lose / I’d set fire to the wood just so you wouldn’t have to bury me too.”
Recent sophomore album “Orca” follows Dapperton’s 2019 debut project, “Where The Polly People Go.” Filled with honest and reflective lyrics, the 10-track project is an elevated development from the artist. In contrast with previous projects, the new work leaves behind the dreamy synths and opts for raw sounds.
“This album represents everyone and everything’s ability to hurt,” Dapperton writes in an explanatory Instagram post on Sept. 20. “Its contents represent everyone and everything’s ability to heal. And its journey represents everyone and everything’s ability to help.”In the latter half of the virtual livestream, the brutal honesty of Dapperton’s recent project came across. Reckoning with feelings of instability and entrapment makes its central themes topical now more than ever. 
The self-expression in “Orca” provides a sense of comfort for the tired individual to enfold themselves in, even if it means doing so from across a screen.

From fast-paced cumbias to ’90s reggaeton, there is no singular sound that fully encapsulates the array of diversity of the Latinx community. With vibrant choruses and fresh takes, there is a new set of musicians who are taking their place in the music industry. Here are 10 artists whose refreshing works are pushing the societal boundaries of what it means to be a Latinx artist.
Omar Apollo
Known for his laid-back songwriting and soft-focus synths, Omar Apollo emerged from the playlist algorithms with honest singles “Ugotme” and “Brakelights.” Adding his own smooth vocals and funky bass tabs, the Mexican American artist’s evolved sound keeps fans eager for his new projects. Recently signed to Warner Records, Apollo has proved himself as a maximalist creative with the innate ability to produce music. After giving the latest single “Kamikaze” a listen, you will find yourself rooting for him as well.
The Marías
Building a dreamy escape for listeners, The Marías are a must-listen psychedelic indie-pop duo. Puerto Rican lead singer María Zardoya and multi-hyphenate musician Josh Conway have developed a signature sound full of grainy texture and cinematic instrumentation. Incorporating wistful trumpet solos and electric guitar strums, the pair are able to integrate their influences into a cohesive sound. Their latest single “Jupiter” is an encapsulating track filled with dreamy synths and echoey vocals.
La Doña
San Francisco’s Cecilia Cassandra Peña-Govea, otherwise known as La Doña, is taking over. Growing up with a musical family, Peña-Govea cultivated a range of multi-instrumental talents. With rambunctious blends of Caribbean and heavy reggaeton beats, she is now creating songs that amplify her feminist perspective. Her EP, “Algo Nuevo,” is filled with strong lyrics and traditional horns. The Chicana artist continues to incorporate her radical politics into her music, demanding to be listened to. 
Ambar Lucid
The New Jersey transplant has an impressive collection of songs. Producing exciting contemporary music, with touches of experimental pop, the Mexican-Dominican artist does not confine herself to labels. Lucid’s debut album, “Garden of Lucid,” highlights a youthful vocal performance and innovative imagery. The track “Universe” unveils the rhythmic vocals and spacey bilingual lyricism that Lucid has worked tirelessly to curate.
Jasper Bones
The Pasadena native is pav-ing his own path with what he’s coined as “Chicano wavy-soul.” Jasper Bones’ 2017 bilingual single “Oscuridad” earned him a loyal fan base. Under his belt are numerous sold out shows at the historic Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. Recently, the L.A. native performed a virtual mini-set at “Los Angeles Lindo y Querido: A Tribute to Thee Midniters.” Presented by Tecate, the event celebrated Mexican Independence Day by paying tribute to two integral figures of Mexican American music. 
Boy Pablo
Fronted by 20-year-old Pablo Muñoz, the Norwegian band is a staple to any indie playlist. The 2017 EP “Roy Pablo” featured the viral song “Everytime,” which the YouTube algorithm promoted to the lo-fi bedroom pop fans. With that said, it was only a matter of time for the band to reach indie stardom. The band’s earnest lo-fi bedroom production and catchy guitar riffs creates a welcoming experience for listeners. Boy Pablo’s debut album “Wachito Rico” comes out on October 23, via Norwegian label 777 Music.
Inner Wave
From backyard shows to a post-poned debut Coachella performance, the Inglewood band Inner Wave influenced the L.A. music scene for Latinx youth. The L.A. ensemble is made up of Pablo Sotelo, Jean Pierre Narvaez, Chris Runners, Elijah Trujillo and Luis Portillo. Experimenting with various sounds, the indie-psychedelic band doesn’t stick to any one genre. Their latest EP “wyd” is a play on an experimental blend of electronic funk.
August Eve
August Eve is a bold, stricken vocalist who works in a variety of creative fields. Born and raised in L.A., Eve had been exposed to a variety of contemporary art and music. As an artist on Diplo’s Mad Decent record label, she has sign-ons by major players in the music industry. On the singles, “You Already Know” and “Ghost,” her classic arrangements and smokey vocal tones result in captivating sounds. As a creative director, Eve shines through the gritty film and allures listeners through stunning visuals.
Victor Internet
The Chicago native has built a following with candid songwriting and captivating production. Singles such as “Tinder Song” have resonated with fans, currently reaching over 25 million streams on Spotify. Before headlining his own tours, Victor Internet was the supporting act for artists including Cautious Clay, Still Woozy and most recently, Cuco. With his 2019 debut EP aptly titled “Victor’s Debut,’’ the project showcases musically ambitious tracks that explore the indie artist’s development to come.
Girl Ultra
Mariana de Miguel, who per-forms under the stage name Girl Ultra, is merging her native Mexican background with nostalgic ’90s R&B. The Finesse Records artist sings entirely in Spanish, simultaneously fusing her inf luences into a contemporary sound. In her latest collabo-ration with Madrid-based singer Paula Cendajas, “Ojos Negros,” the rhythmic track showcases a different side to the boundaries of Latin music.
