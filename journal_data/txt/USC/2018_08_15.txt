Leaders are usually the first people considered for removal after a huge scandal rocks the organization they are running. Even if they are not directly responsible, they act as figureheads for the organization, and their removal is sometimes necessary for a fresh start. 
Despite the amazing feats USC has accomplished under former president C. L. Max Nikias’ leadership, he had little choice but to resign in May. 
The question now becomes whether a change in leadership will actually effect change or whether Nikias’ resignation is merely an act of pacification meant to quell the community’s concerns. The answer is most likely the latter. 
What the University really needs to reset its direction may be more than just a new president.
Moving forward, the lesson USC should learn from this fiasco is simple: The administration must practice transparency.
Transparency entails coming clean after an incident — no matter how unpalatable and regardless of whether students, faculty or administration leaders are involved. 
The executive committee of the Board of Trustees announced the formation of a special committee that has hired external counsel to lead an independent investigation regarding the misconduct allegations against Tyndall. This committee’s investigation will help hold those who knew about Tyndall’s alleged miscunduct and failed to protect students. Ultimately, the goal of the committee is to look forward and ensure that no future Trojan will be left in the dark about horrific actions taking place on their campus.
And the solution to that is to simply listen, to take students seriously and not dismiss their complaints. While college students are legally considered adults and are bound by certain adult responsibilities, many decisions are still made on their behalf by authoritative figures who presume to know better.
Students make a conscious and deliberate choice to apply to and enroll to this university. As much as universities want to believe they possess the power in selecting candidates during the admissions processes, ultimately it is the school that is — or at least should be — working for the students. After all, we are paying for the school’s services, and it should  in turn respect our wishes. 
Subsequently, the University ought to give students the full picture: highlight the good, but never cover up the bad.
If students make a willful decision to come to this school as opposed to the hundreds of others across the country, they must truly love it. When bad things happen (which they inevitably will), the University must take responsibility and make an honest effort to communicate with its students, staff and faculty.
Let’s hope that when calamities unavoidably occur, our University keeps us informed. Let’s hope the administration works with the student body to resolve ongoing problems instead of against them in an attempt to conceal wrongdoing.
Nikias elevated USC to the same level as some of this country’s finest institutions of higher education, and brought in billions in donations. He not only oversaw the school’s tremendous strides in research and fundraising but also helped saw the University soar in the national rankings.
So was the Tyndall scandal enough to justify Nikias’ ousting? Well, if Nikias recieves applause for all the ways he benefited the University, he must also be held accountable when scandals break.
If Nikias was aware of and deliberately tried to cover up the sexual misconduct that occurred at Tyndall’s hands, his resignation is all the more just. But even if he didn’t, his stepping down is necessary for at least the appearance of a fresh start on the University’s part. Whether the University will indeed start anew is still unclear.
To interim president Wanda Austin: We hope you continue maximizing USC’s potential as a world-class institution, just as Nikias did in the last eight years. We value your leadership during this difficult time. But in the same vein, please listen to student voices and engage in conversation with us. USC is our home and our community, as it is yours, and we hope that you hold us to the high standards that this institution is capable of meeting.

Last season, senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin played in just four games due to toe and bicep injuries. Over his collegiate career, he’s recorded 109 tackles, 14 sacks and 23 tackles for loss. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Trojans senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin will miss two to five weeks of fall practice, according to USC head coach Clay Helton. Gustin suffered a torn meniscus during a collision at last Tuesday’s practice and had to be carted off the field. 
Helton announced the prognosis the next day, following an MRI. 
“Sometimes, the good Lord watches after you,” a relieved Helton said.  
According to Helton, Gustin underwent surgery on Thursday. The head coach said there was no ligament damage to his knee, despite initial concerns. On Tuesday, Helton said that linebacker “was not in a lot of pain,” but did say his knee “felt funny.” 
“Knowing Porter, I know he’ll rehab the heck out of it,” Helton said after Wednesday’s practice. “If you remember [former USC defensive end] Rasheem Green had this, played in about two weeks. [Senior cornerback] Ajene [Harris] had it over the spring, took him about three and half weeks to get back.” 
According to the Orange County Register, Gustin walked uninhibited at Wednesday’s practice session. His status for the season opener against UNLV on Sept.  1 is currently unknown, though Helton isn’t planning on holding him back, if healthy. 
“When he’s 100 percent, he’ll go,”  Helton said. “I know Porter. He’ll give it everything he has to be back as soon as possible.”
Gustin elected to return for his senior season after an injury-riddled junior campaign. He suffered a broken toe during Week 2 against Stanford, and re-injured it in the Texas game, still managing a two-sack first half performance. Gustin played in just four games total, nursing toe and bicep ailments throughout the year. 
The Utah-born pass-rusher returns as a cornerstone of USC’s defense. Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s unit led the nation in sacks last year, but it lost the likes of Uchenna Nwosu, Rasheem Green and Josh Fatu on the front-seven. 
Over his career, Gustin has recorded 14 sacks and 23 tackles for loss. He tallied three sacks in three starts during his shortened 2017 season. 
In addition to Gustin’s injury, senior linebacker Cam Smith was held out of practice with a hamstring injury on Tuesday and Wednesday. However, it is not believed to be serious. 
Even with two star linebackers sidelined, Helton is still optimistic about the situation. Freshman outside linebacker Kana’i Mauga and junior inside linebacker Jordan Iosefa have stepped up in their teammates’ absences. Helton stressed the importance of depth heading into this season. 
“It’s also allowed us to be able to work guys like [sophomore linebacker] Hunter Echols, who’s doing a great job for us,” Helton said. “And [sophomore linebacker] Juliano Falaniko. I think about those edge guys, right now … and they’re really coming on and we need them to.”

The USC men’s basketball team announced its 2018-19 regular season schedule this past month, which will feature tough non-conference matchups.
Along with eight non-conference home games at Galen Center, the Trojans will welcome their Pac-12 foes Cal, Stanford, UCLA, Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, Utah, Oregon and Oregon State.
Although the Trojans have the same number of home games this season as they did last season, the three-game home stretch against UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State contrasts last season’s three-game stretch when the Trojans went on the road to play the same teams. 
Speaking of contrast, while USC saw Washington and Washington State at home for their first conference games of 2018, they will instead go on the road in 2019 to play the Huskies and Cougars in the middle of the season.
The Trojans will also break last season’s precedent by ending their Pac-12 schedule with games on the road against Colorado and Utah. This will be the first time since 2015 that the Trojans do not end their regular season at the Galen Center.
In terms of Troy’s non-conference offerings, head coach Andy Enfield and the team will look forward to games against highly-touted Nevada and TCU, and rematches against Oklahoma, Vanderbilt and Santa Clara.
After advancing to the Sweet 16 last season, the Wolf Pack come into 2018 as a preseason top-25 ball club and a favorite to win the Mountain West with a roster that returns a majority of their players, including four of their five starters. 
Not to mention, USC will also be a part of the National Association of Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame Classic in Kansas City, Mo. and could encounter either Texas Tech, Nebraska or Missouri State. 
Like Nevada, Texas Tech made waves in last year’s March Madness bracket, taking its run all the way to the Elite Eight last season, where they lost to eventual champion Villanova.
If the Trojans can squeak out a win over either Nevada, TCU or Texas Tech, they could potentially land themselves in the top-25 rankings.
Aside from top teams like Nevada, Texas Tech and NIT participants Nebraska, Stetson, UC Davis and Southern Utah will make their first ever trips to Troy.
Meanwhile the Trojans trounced Robert Morris University 92-77 in their first and only meeting back in December 1991. 
For the first time since 2016, USC will battle four in-state opponents in Cal State Bakersfield, UC Davis, Long Beach State and Santa Clara during their non-conference slate.
The last time USC played both CSUB and LBSU, the Trojans split the series in 2013-14, beating Bakersfield 63-59 at home and then dropping the next game to Long Beach on the road 72-71.
All in all, the Trojans sport an all-time 51-29 combined record against their non-conference opponents, including wins and losses vacated due to USC’s 2009 sanctions.
After going undefeated in their 2017 non-conference schedule, the pre-season No. 10 Trojans dropped three-straight to Texas A&M, SMU and Oklahoma. They also suffered a wacky 103-93 overtime loss to Princeton, escaping 2018 with a 9-4 non-conference record. 
USC’s first game of the 2018 season will take place against Robert Morris on Nov. 6 at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier led the women’s volleyball team with 511 kills in 2017. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With old and new faces on the court, the USC women’s volleyball team will return this season on quest to win a seventh NCAA championship.
USC lost five seniors last year including two of its top point leaders in opposite hitters Brittany Abercrombie and Niki Withers. Recently, Abercrombie qualified for the 25-player preliminary U.S. Women’s National Team roster and represented USC on the preliminary team along with associate head coach JJ Van Niel, who served as an assistant coach for the United States. Other seniors to depart the team include former captain and middle blocker Jordan Dunn and defensive specialist Nikki Leonard. 
During the offseason, USC announced the hiring of Brent Crouch, who previously served as head coach of the University of Portland women’s volleyball team. Crouch is credited with turning the program around  and was named the West Coast Conference Coach of the Year in 2016 when he led the Pilots to a 17-13 record after the team went winless only a few years before. 
Crouch takes the reins from Mick Haley, who was fired after a 17 years at the University. Haley’s stint included national championships in 2002 and 2003. After getting fired, the 74-year-old AVCA Hall of Famer filed a legal case against USC, claiming that he was discriminated against because of his age.  
In his first year at the helm, Crouch will look to incorporate five freshmen and a junior transfer. One of these freshman who could contribute early is Ashley Humphreys. The 5-foot-11 setter from Newport Beach was a two-time All-Orange County selection and helped lead Corona Del Mar High School through three remarkable seasons. She joins junior Cindy Marina and fellow incoming freshman Raquel Lazaro as setters on the roster. The rest of the freshmen newcomers include Brooklyn Schirmer, Abby Hansen and Siena Secrist. Jasmine Gross, a third-year player who spent the last two seasons at Pepperdine, rounds out the reinforcements.
Despite the coaching and player overhaul, USC will need to rely on a few familiar faces to carry the load. 
Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier is slated to once again shoulder a huge load for the Women of Troy. The 2017 AVCA and Volleyball Magazine First Team All-American was integral in USC’s run last season, finishing in the top five in kills, points and aces in the Pac-12. Alongside Lanier, USC will also once again lean on senior libero Victoria Garrick. The former Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week started 34 out of the 35 matches last year and led USC with 519 digs last season.
USC’s first tests of the season will begin at the Galen Center for the Trojan Invitational on Aug. 24. Their first opponent will be a clash against a Kentucky Wildcats squad that was chosen as the favorite to win the SEC by its league’s coaches and three preseason All-SEC selections in Leah Edmond, Madison Lilley and Avery Skinner. Other important matchups  include a rematch from last year’s NCAA regional final with the Florida Gators on Aug. 31 in Gainesville, Fla. and showdowns with Stanford, Washington and UCLA, all of which finished in the top 15 of the AVCA Coaches Poll last season.

Ball hawk · Senior linebacker Cam Smith will return to captain the Trojans’ defense. Last season, he touted 112 tackles, one interception, one fumble recovery and three deflections. He was also All-Pac-12 first team. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Heading into the 2018 college football season, nine current USC players have been featured on watch lists for various individual awards. 
In all, players received 16 nominations for 10 different awards. Despite having no members of the 2017 USC football team take home awards a year ago, offensive coordinator Tee Martin and former quarterback Sam Darnold were both recognized as nominees for the Broyles Award (the nation’s top assistant coach) and Walter Camp Award (player of the year), respectively.
Of all USC athletes recognized, senior linebacker Cameron Smith and senior safety Marvell Tell III led the way with three nominations each. Smith and Tell were both nominated for the Bednarik Award (outstanding defensive player of the year) and the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (best defensive player in college football) after the two seniors compiled fantastic performances in 2017. 
Elsewhere on defense, senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin is being watched for both the Bednarik and the Butkus Awards (best linebacker in college football) heading into 2018 despite only playing in four games last season. Meanwhile, redshirt junior defensive lineman Christian Rector is also drawing the attention of Nagurksi Trophy voters after his outstanding 7.5-sack campaign in 2017. Finally, senior cornerback Iman Marshall has been mentioned alongside Tell as a candidate for the Jim Thorpe Award, an honor bestowed upon the nation’s best defensive back.
While the Trojans have a slew of defensive athletes on watch lists, the USC offense doesn’t lack representation either. Leading the way is sophomore running back Stephen Carr who has been put on preseason lists for the Maxwell Award (college football player of the year) as well as the Doak Walker Award (nation’s best running back). After a breakout freshman season in which Carr battled through injuries to deliver in clutch situations against Western Michigan and Texas, the sophomore tailback again looks to be a difference maker in the USC offense in 2018. 
Furthermore, senior lineman Toa Lobendahn has been recognized as a candidate for the Rimington (college football’s top center) and Outland (nation’s best interior lineman) trophies. Having played just about every position along the offensive line in his Trojan career, Lobendahn’s status as a premier run and pass blocker could notch himself some awards by the end of the season. Additionally, senior tight end Tyler Petite has been named to the Mackey Award watch list for the nation’s top tight end. Although many Trojans have been nominated for the award since its creation in 2000, no USC player has received it since Fred Davis in 2007.
Lastly, the Trojans also have a special teams player who has been recognized for a potential award at the end of the season. Redshirt junior long snapper Jake Olson was named to the Wuerffel Trophy preseason watch list as one of the nation’s leaders in community service along with academic and athletic achievement. Entering his junior year, Olson played in two games in 2017 long snapping in home wins over Western Michigan and Oregon State. The trophy would not be the first time Olson was honored for his play or off-field excellence: He was a semifinalist for the Jason Witten Collegiate Man of the Year Award and was also named Pac-12 Special Teams Player of the Week in 2017.
Below is the full list of USC players named on watch lists and the awards for which they are being recognized:

Coming off an early exit in the second round of the NCAA tournament with a loss to Baylor, the USC women’s soccer team is ready to start its 2018 season set on a deep run in the tournament. Touting a sizable roster of young talent, the Women of Troy will open their season at UC Irvine on Aug. 16.
“One of the things that aligns with our deficiencies last year is our new thing: trust,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “We got caught up with ourselves a bit, we forgot about the grind, the togetherness, the unity, forgot to trust each other. So we started this past January trying to rebuild what we’re about. We’re more talented top to bottom than we were a year ago, but more importantly we’re a year older.”
The Women of Troy have some great talent returning, namely seniors defender Ally Prisock and forward Leah Pruitt. Prisock earned a spot on the All-Pac-12 first team and the All-West Region first team for the 2017 season, while Pruitt was a member of the All-West Region third team. As consistent starters throughout the previous season, the duo will be regarded by the rest of the team as strong leaders on the field.

During the offseason, USC picked up two powerhouse transfers who are both eligible for the 2018 season: redshirt junior defender-forward Natalie Jacobs and sophomore midfielder Alea Hyatt. Jacobs, a transfer from Notre Dame University,  made the ACC All-Freshman Team, was her team’s leading scorer as a forward and played for the United States U-20 National Team in the 2016 U-20 World Cup. Even though she will make her debut as a Trojan this season, expectations are high for the Notre Dame transfer to demonstrate both versatile gameplay and experienced leadership. 
Hyatt will join the Women of Troy from the University of North Carolina where she played in 19 games to help UNC win the ACC title in her freshman season and competed in the NCAA Sweet 16. A standout at Santa Barbara High School, she was also a member of the 2015 United States U-18 National Team. 
Further contributions come from Jacobs’ former teammate midfielder Megan McCashland, a graduate transfer student from South Bend who earned All-ACC Academic Honor Roll each season at Notre Dame.
The Trojans have also added seven incoming freshmen who show promise as contributors for this season and for the future of the program. Midfielder Madeline Vergura enters USC ranked No. 17 in the 2018 recruiting class. Along with forward Penelope Hocking, who was the 20th-ranked player, Vergura is expected to be a standout player.  
A few Trojan returners have spent the offseason improving their games with the U-20 Women’s National Team. Sophomores midfielder Savannah DeMelo and forward Tara McKeown, along with Hocking, have been training with the team and are competing in the U-20 World Cup in France this month, while incoming freshman defender Ashley Soto will play for Mexico. These four players bring  invaluable international experience to McAlister Field this season. 
Following the 2017 season, USC’s women’s soccer program underwent some coaching changes but remains stable under McAlpine’s leadership after.  Jen Klein, former USC associate head coach and recruiting coordinator, left to take over the head coaching position at the University of Michigan. McAlpine has since hired Sammy Towne as assistant coach, replacing Jason Lockhart who held the position since 2014. Towne was an assistant coach at UNC Greensboro until 2015 when she returned to her alma mater as the director of soccer operations at Auburn University. 
This season will mark McAlpine’s fifth as a Trojan. He has lead the Women of Troy to four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances and to their second national title in 2016. 
“I think this year’s team is going to be super exciting to watch because we are more technical, because we are a year older with players who were around that national championship year, who had smaller roles taking bigger roles this year,” McAlpine said. “The expectation of them is to have grown in their roles. I think this team has the ability to keep the ball for longer periods of time, play some exciting soccer, and I think we have the opportunity to win a lot of games.”

Head coach Keidane McAlpine has the unique ability to breathe life into the programs he leads. Under his leadership, the three teams McAlpine has head coached for have all shown upward trends. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
There are very few coaches who can revitalize a soccer team the way Keidane McAlpine has turned around the USC women’s soccer program. Relationships and trust built by and for the team are more important than the way the team plays the sport  — this philosophy sets him apart from other coaching powerhouses.

“When you’re not thinking about the grind and you’re just enjoying the time with the people that you’re with and you can smile even on the bad days,” McAlpine said. “It makes it easier to go and do the hard stuff because you look to the person next to you and say, ‘You know what? I’m going to work a little harder for them.’”

Much of this mindset stems from a mix of his own family upbringing, religious background and one of his most important mentors.

McAlpine started his collegiate soccer journey at Birmingham-Southern College in his home state of Alabama. He played four years of NAIA collegiate soccer before graduating in 1997 with a bachelor’s degree in music business. McAlpine started on the school’s team for all four years and was named captain in 1996. 

He says his experience as a player has contributed heavily to his success as a coach: starting, being benched, being injured, reaching national finals and even traveling abroad.

“There was just a wealth of experiences that I had there that helped me grow but also influence how I want a program and my ability to relate to the players,” McAlpine said.

After graduating, McAlpine  started coaching his younger sister’s high school level soccer team, where he continued fostering his relationship with Jason Lockhart, a childhood friend who is now his assistant coach.

When Keidane McAlpine accepted the head coaching position for USC women’s soccer, he knew that a championship would be in sight. In a 2014 interview with the Daily Trojan, McAlpine predicted a title in the near future. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
He then went on to work alongside Lorrin Etka-Shepherd, who coached the women’s soccer team at his alma mater. She has become one of the biggest influences on McAlpine’s coaching style.

Etka-Shepherd  utilized McAlpine’s playing experience and ability to connect with players  as a liaison between the coaching staff and the players.
“I was her voice,” McAlpine said. “She used me and my relationship with the players to get her words across. She taught me about managing in general. It was a great first experience.” 
McAlpine soon became the coach of Birmingham-Southern after Etka-Shepherd retired in 2001. He on to coach there until 2005. His five years as the head coach prepared him for his subsequent success. In 2006, he joined Auburn as an assistant coach. Six years later, he moved on to lead Washington State in the Pac-12. 
When McAlpine arrived in Pullman, Wash., he was faced with a team that lacked consistency in years past, with a .609 winning percentage in 2011 and a .305 percentage the year before.
McAlpine took the squad’s winning percentage up to .762 only two years later, earning him the 2013 Pac-12 Coach of the Year award. The team’s record that year was 14-3-4, tying the team’s most wins in a season and set the Cougars in seventh place nationally.   
And while his two years with the Cougars were arguably two of his best coaching years at the time, McAlpine knew USC would be a perfect fit for him. 
“Being from the South, there are a lot of things about [USC] that stood out,” McAlpine said. “I’m the son of two educators, so the academic profile of the school fit very well [and] the athletic tradition being from the South, being around programs that are frenzied with that, so to come down here and find a fan base that has a similar appetite for athletics was fantastic.”
When McAlpine arrived in Los Angeles in 2014, the USC women’s soccer team was at a low point. It had been three years since the team had posted a winning record. However, McAlpine was more than prepared to overcome the challenge. In his first season as head coach, he revived the program to tout a record of 12-6-3. Since then, the Trojans have yet to dip below a .600 winning percentage and have recorded two .800 seasons.
Those numbers are impressive for any coach, but they become astounding when you consider the fact that McAlpine has only been with the Trojans for four years. McAlpine insists that it is his coaching philosophy that has made him and his teams so successful. Rather than focusing heavily on the technicalities of the game and ruling with an iron fist like some coaches, McAlpine opts to practice trust and enhance the relationships among players and coaches.
“I try to continue to teach and recognize that the women that come to play for us in college are still unfinished products,” McAlpine said. “I try to allow them some space to be themselves, to have some fun still. And I try to find people that just like to play and create an environment around that which gives them flexibility. 
McAlpine plans to attack the 2018 season in the same way he attacks every year. After an early exit in the 2017 NCAA tournament, new standards have been set, and while the Women of Troy will focus on improving technical skills like finding consistency in putting shots on frame, the theme of the offseason has been focusing on the trust aspect from player-to-player — something that began to falter at the end of the 2017 season. 
“I think the trust and consistency goes back to our unity and our togetherness and we felt that that was a bigger contributor to even the small details in putting shots on frame  — having the trust in each other to be in the right place and to get to the right place,” McAlpine said. “We started this past January trying to rebuild our culture, rebuild what we are about. We as a staff look at it and ask, ‘What got us there in the first place? Let’s go back to year one and start this process over.’” 
McAlpine feels that the training and bonding that has taken place in the offseason will put the Women of Troy in a good place this season. With a lot of young talent and several championship winning veterans, McAlpine and Co. hope to reconcile their troubles from the end of the 2017 season to produce another solid regular season and make a championship bid.
“This year’s team is going to be super exciting to watch because we are more technical, because we are a year older, with players who were around that national championship year,” McAlpine said. “I think this team has the ability to play some exciting soccer and I think we have an opportunity to win a lot of games.”

The start of the fall semester means the return of the best time of the year — college football season.
After losing standout stars like Sam Darnold and Ronald Jones to the NFL, USC head coach Clay Helton will be challenged to wrangle a young offense into a team that can contest for another Pac-12 championship.
The team enters the season with a major, pressing question — who will run the offense? The Trojans lack a wealth of experience, despite the allure of the talented true freshman quarterback JT Daniels. 
One of the top quarterback recruits in the country, Daniels won Gatorade Player of the Year after tossing 12,014 yards and 152 touchdowns for Mater Dei High School. After reclassifying in order to come to USC a year early, the young star is already making a name for himself at practice.
“Always in my mind for the quarterback, it’s about decision-making, timing and accuracy and, most important, moving the ball and being productive about putting it in the red zone,” Helton said after Daniels’ first practice. “For an 18-year-old kid to come out here [and] do what he did today was very impressive. It’s like he’s already been in a camp before, to be honest with you. I was highly impressed.”

But will his lack of experience keep Daniels from the starting lineup? 
The Trojans aren’t exactly deep in experience in the quarterback position; redshirt sophomore Matt Fink serves as the veteran of the unit with nine passes under his belt, playing behind Sam Darnold. And with big shoes to fill in the running back position, as redshirt sophomore Stephen Carr looks to step up in the place of running back Ronald Jones, the offense will lean heavily on whoever Helton chooses as the starting QB.
Weeks ago, the defense seemed to be the strongest link of this USC team, led by the terrifying tandem of senior linebackers Cam Smith and Porter Gustin. But Gustin suffered a meniscus tear at practice on Tuesday, and his road to recovery post-surgery remains uncertain. 
Last season, he injured his big toe and tore his right bicep in the team’s second game against Stanford. He attempted to return in the following game against Texas, but was forced to leave the game after wrapping up two sacks and never saw the field again.
“It’s probably the most frustrating part,” Gustin said of his injuries at Pac-12 media day in July. “All of a sudden you break a small bone like that, that you don’t even realize how much you need it playing football. It’s that much tougher, but you sit out and you learn from it. Really all you can do is pray it doesn’t happen again.”
The team remains hopeful to get the 6-foot-5, 260-pound “predator” back into rotation by kickoff of the season opener against UNLV. It will be most important, however, to see Gustin return by Week 2 in the Trojans’ toughest matchup — the Weekender trip to face Stanford.
The Cardinal are the biggest obstacle standing in between Helton and a second-straight Pac-12 championship appearance. The obvious challenge in any game against Stanford is Bryce Love, the senior All-Conference running back who made a game out of torching holes in every Pac-12 defense last year. 
Last year’s matchup against Stanford was the most complete game for the Trojans, as they tallied 623 offensive yards while holding Stanford to 342 yards on the way to a 42-24 victory. As Love looks to open his Heisman bid, the USC defense must be locked in and prepared to repeat that performance.
Another major milestone for Helton’s squad is the Week 3 matchup on the road at Texas. Forget the Longhorns’ mediocre 7-6 finish to the 2017 season. Last year’s 2006 Rose Bowl rematch resulted in a double overtime thriller, and the sequel is guaranteed to continue to add to the myth of this budding rivalry.
Closing the season with back-to-back matchups against UCLA and Notre Dame will cap off the difficult season for the Trojans. While USC will travel across town to face the Bruins, the Notre Dame game will be at the Coliseum. Facing Chip Kelly’s new squad and the top-25-ranked Fighting Irish will be a proving ground for the Trojans to round out the season.
While the season might seem uncertain now, the last time the team entered the season with uncertainty at quarterback, they emerged with Darnold and a Rose Bowl victory in hand. And as this new squad develops, the only proof will come on the field with the first snap of the season in September.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
It only took a 36-word statement for LeBron James to shock the sports world. Last month, the NBA star announced his decision to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers — the biggest name in basketball moving his star to Hollywood and his talents to Staples Center, just blocks away from USC.  
On the court, LeBron is a boon for the young Lakers, a gift from the heavens for a team that has not made the playoffs in five years and is looking for a superstar in the post-Kobe Bryant era. In James, they get everything: a recognizable name that will re-instill confidence in a demanding fanbase, a leader who makes his teammates better and the greatest player of all time.
Even at 33 years old, James is very much in his prime, both in terms of skill set and brand. He is still capable of earth-shattering dunks, ridiculous shots and clutch performances. Last season, he dragged a Cavaliers team that featured Jeff Green as its third-best player to the NBA Finals. Despite today’s basketball shifting more and more toward perimeter shooting and away from the bully-ball where he thrived early in his career, James has adapted to become an all-around talent who is somehow even better now than he was eight years ago.
But his on-court contributions belie his true value to the Lakers, to Los Angeles and to the sports world. In a region chock full of some of the world’s greatest athletes, James immediately rises above them all. Mike Trout plays for the Angels; Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers; Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the Galaxy ­— all of them pale in comparison to LeBron. Southern California possesses a pair of professional teams in all four major American sports plus soccer — in addition to two of the most recognizable collegiate programs in the country — and yet, by adding LeBron, the Lakers are the No. 1 show in town.
It’s not hard to discern why. James has built a personal brand and reputation that is universally respected. Early in his career, he was criticized for being egotistical, for choking in the clutch, for being a traitor after he left his hometown Cleveland in 2010 to build a superteam in Miami. But he won some titles in South Beach, came back to Cleveland and brought a championship home, and the narrative shifted. He was a leader, a hero, a legend.
Today, James is one of those athletes who is more than just an athlete — he transcends sports. His sponsorships and endorsements make him one of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. He is very active in charities and the community. Earlier this month, he opened his “I Promise” school in his hometown of Akron, Ohio for at-risk students, a school that guarantees college tuition at the University of Akron to all graduates. James is also invested in politics. Last week, it was announced that he would produce a Showtime documentary series titled “Shut Up and Dribble”; James will also host an  HBO unscripted series called “The Shop,” which features him having barbershop conversations with celebrities in sports and entertainment.
Being the best basketball player on the planet is the fifth or sixth most important thing James has ever done, and that is more impressive than any feat he’s accomplished on the court. When President Donald Trump went on his favorite app — because he had nothing better to do on a Friday night — and childishly attacked James, athletes, celebrities and politicians alike leapt to his defense. When Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized James for wading into politics, the backlash against her comments was fierce. This is the kind of respect James garners: He is a respected public figure first, and a basketball player second.
Even with James, the Lakers face a tough road to championship glory. With the Western Conference loaded with elite teams including the Warriors and Rockets, the Lakers may not even make it to the Finals. But at this point in his career, James is likely looking beyond basketball. If the recent headlines are any indication, he is seeking a place where he can grow his brand, use his platform for good and become known not only as a basketball legend, but also as a celebrity who made the world a better place. 
As the second largest media market in the country, Los Angeles is a prime location for exactly that. After establishing his stardom, L.A. is where James has decided to settle, and Angelenos should prepare for King James to take over not just the sports page, but also the front page. 

Eric He is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism.  He is also the managing editor of the Daily Trojan. His column “Grinding Gears” typically runs Thursdays.

In an age where festival headliners have become almost homogenized, one California desert festival has separated itself from the pack. And no, it is not the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival — truthfully, this festival is a far cry from it. 
From Oct. 12 to 14, fans of experimental music will flock to Moreno Beach at Lake Perris for the seventh annual Desert Daze. Patrons can enjoy the all-new beach club complete with a swimming area at this new venue. In previous years, the festival took place in arid locations like Desert Hot Springs, Sunset Ranch and the Institute of Mentalphysics at Joshua Tree National Park. 
This year, psych-rockers Tame Impala and King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard will headline a carefully curated lineup that includes boundary-pushing acts such as Death Grips, Warpaint, Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, Kevin Morby and Ty Segall & White Fence, among many others.
As part of the festival’s anticipatory marketing tactics, the lineup has been rolled out in phases, with its most recent “Phase III”  released on July 24. This edition includes the addition of shoegaze legends My Bloody Valentine, artpop singer Julia Holter, minimalist rock trio Shellac and others to an already star-studded cast.
Since its inception in 2012, Desert Daze has built a reputation as the quirkier, younger sibling of Southern California’s primary music festivals. With many of the same artists headlining festivals across the country, Desert Daze has targeted a different crop of indie and experimental artists and built an equally niche audience in the process.
A large part of the festival’s appeal lies in exclusivity. Over the years, attendees have had the opportunity to see their favorite artists to perform some of their most seminal works in full. Most notably, psych-rock band The Black Angels performed “Passover” in 2016, and stoner metal band Sleep performed “Holy Mountain” in its entirety in 2017. This year is no different, as Desert Daze has enlisted both indie rockers Mercury Rev and drone metal pioneers Earth to perform their full album sets.
In addition to their unique musical lineups, the festival incorporates a variety of additional programming. Last year, Adult Swim brought its “Things You’ve Never Seen” pop-up to the desert, where attendees could view unaired episodes and participate in free giveaways. In 2016, the festival provided an opening ceremony with rocker and motivational speaker Andrew W.K., accompanied by closing remarks from slam poet Saul Williams on the final day. 
This year, fans can attend a variety of lectures headlined by legendary musician and audio engineer Steve Albini, with more to be announced at a later date. Additionally, art installations inspired by psychedelic culture and the abstract movement will be on display. 
For now, a lineup brimming with both emerging and established independent artists will be more than enough to draw crowds from Southern California and beyond. By all indications, Desert Daze’s seventh installment will be a musical experience that festival goers and music fans alike cannot afford to miss.

Minutes into the first act of Sara Bareilles’ “Waitress,” it becomes clear that this musical is about women — about their desires, relationships and mistakes. This female voice incarnates itself in Jenna, portrayed by the mesmerizing Desi Oakley, who discovers she is pregnant while stuck in an abusive marriage. Aside from the support of her two best friends — the quirky, shy Dawn (Lenne Klingaman) and bold, saucy Becky (Charity Angél Dawson) — Jenna finds sole solace in the kitchen of the pie shop where she works, where she alchemizes her dilemmas into delicious pies. 
As the story progresses, Jenna unhappily discovers she is pregnant during the hilarious number, “The Negative,” which sees Jenna and her two best friends praying for a single line on the test strip. Her discontent comes mostly from her abusive marriage: her husband Earl’s (Nick Bailey) first instinct at the news is to make her promise that she won’t love the baby more than she loves him. But Jenna chooses to fight; she begins saving shares of her income, hoping to obtain the means to leave Earl and start anew with her child. 
And then comes the affair. Comically, “Bad Idea (Reprise)” is the most memorable scene of the show. All three women fornicate with their significant others on stage: Dawn, who meets the hilarious Ogie (Jeremy Morse) through a dating site, reenacts scenes from the American Revolution (at one point, Ogie shouts, “The British are coming!”); Becky predictably begins a steamy affair with Cal (Ryan G. Dunkin), the manager of the pie shop; Jenna finds intimacy in the arms of Dr. Pomatter (Bryan Fenkart), an awkward, lovable man who gives her the supportive shoulder she had been missing.
Behind the show’s sweet exterior, however, is a drumroll of crescendoing sorrow: Jenna’s violent marriage is akin to that of her late mother, Becky feels stuck caring for her sick, older husband and the affair Jenna eventually begins with her gynecologist is doomed at his early revelation that he has a wife. However, Jessie Nelson’s book, which was based on Adrienne Shelly’s 2007 film of the same name often overshadows its characters’ misery through its constant, impeccably-timed gags. 
Due to its comedic approach, the cloud of tragedy that looms over the musical is largely dismissed  — much of which stems from the names Jenna assigns her various pies (“Betrayed by my eggs pie”). Often, the awkward interactions that are meant to seem comedic — namely between Jenna and her gynecologist-slash-lover Dr. Pomatter — come across as borderline vaudeville. 
Despite the overdose of (often) forced comedy, Oakley shines in her starring role as Jenna. Her voice conveys strength and poignant complexity as opposed to the emotional frailty that Jessie Mueller, who originated the role, had brought. Though Oakley’s vocal performance lacked the sentimental subtext that Mueller delivered in hers, her unwavering belts and youthful delivery allowed the audience to place a little more hope in Jenna’s happy ending. Like Oakley, both Klingaman and Dawson were vivacious in their respective roles as Dawn and Becky. 
Lending itself to the show’s essence of sisterhood was Sara Bareilles’ score, which effortlessly fused Broadway pop with the songwriter’s brand of sentimental balladry and subtext-rich lyricism. Bareilles’s signature sound shines through on the show-stopping “She Used to Be Mine” and clever duet “Bad Idea.” 
The finale number, “Everything Changes,” appears wildly optimistic at first but this is just the sort of hope “Waitress” begs audiences to employ — a larger hope, not only for Jenna, but also for other women who find themselves stuck in impossible, oppressive situations. Like the number, which crescendos gorgeously as any finale track should, Jenna’s problem soon becomes the solution itself. The baby that she was once afraid of gives her the strength to leave her husband and start anew.

Earlier this summer, the School of Cinematic Arts partnered with the U.S. State Department to launch the Middle East Media Initiative, the first in a two-year lineup that aims to expose Middle Eastern writers and producers to Hollywood’s process of developing television. The program ran from July 1 to Aug. 5, during which 10 writers and seven producers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates were able to shadow and develop stories for Middle Eastern television alongside Hollywood personnel and SCA faculty, including visiting professor David Isaacs and lecturer Mort Nathan. 
The program functioned as a professional training program, allowing writers and producers from the region to learn from prominent industry professionals in the U.S. For the first two and a half weeks, participants found themselves in a writer’s room where they workshopped their respective projects. Next, they shadowed and met with industry leaders like producer John Wells (“ER,” “West Wing”), creator Chris Brancato (“Narcos”) and writers Andre and Maria Jacquemetton (“Mad Men”). 
“The focus of the program is really on the participants themselves,” said Zahi Farah, a writer and director from Lebanon. “They’re really teaching us how they function — from writing all the way to production so we can try to transfer this system to the Middle East, where the production system is not optimized for television.” 
Participants in the program were chosen through a closed application system in which they were nominated by producers in the Middle East. In addition to professional development, the program aims to establish a dialogue between American and Middle Eastern creators through a shared approach to innovating and modernizing television in the region. 
“The developing system of projects here in the States is very different from those used in the Middle East,” said Wael Hamdy, a screenwriter from Egypt. “In the Middle Eastern system, the writer is not the showrunner. This is a very American concept. It will  also take some time to bring this concept to our systems.” 
The Middle East Media Initiative follows Netflix’s recent string of high quality international commissions, such as the original series “Sacred Games” from India. Netflix also commissioned its first Arabic drama earlier this year, signaling the streaming service’s increased involvement in the region’s entertainment. The original series, “Jinn,” will be directed by Mir Jen Bou Chaaya of the Lebanese thriller “Very Big Shot,” and will be written by Jordanian screenwriter Bassel Ghandour, who previously penned the Oscar-nominated “Theeb.” 
Under the leadership of program director Deana Nassar, the Middle East Media Initiative promises to bring original, Hollywood-style entertainment to audiences in the region while establishing international relationships between writers and producers.

Los Angeles is a city like no other — it exists at the intersection of entertainment and culture. 
A melting pot of diverse histories and identities, the City of Angels was practically built for exploration. Walking a few blocks through any given neighborhood will lead explorers to a completely different locale with new atmospheres and flairs. 
Conveniently located in the heart of L.A., USC allows students the flexibility to explore many diverse communities beyond the red-brick walls of its campus. 
Here are several ways to make the most of your time while working, playing and, most importantly, exploring in the City of Angels.
 
CHECK OUT A LOCAL RESTAURANT
For a nearby hangout destination, try Study Hall, a pub-style eatery located on the corner of 29th and Hoover streets.  About a 10-minute walk from campus, Study Hall offers a variety of fan-favorite entrees like Margherita flatbreads, chicken pesto sandwiches and chili cheese fries. With a relaxing ambiance and friendly service, Study Hall is the ideal after-class spot. 
For all-you-can-eat Korean barbeque, venture out to Bulgogi Hut in Koreatown to fill up. With a variety of options like its signature bulgogi, black angus beef brisket and bacon- wrapped rice cake, this affordable restaurant is sure to be a frequented joint. 
For lazy days, pay a visit to a coffee shop in the Arts District like the tried-and-true Blue Bottle, which offers richly roasted coffee and warm pastries in a hip environment. Perfect for studying or catching up with a friend, Blue Bottle has a setting to suit everyone’s espresso needs. 
 
ENJOY A NATURE GETAWAY
If Downtown traffic begins to feel stifling, step outside the urban jungle and experience some of L.A.’s finest getaways. Take the Expo line to Santa Monica and soak up some Southern California sunshine. From renting Bird scooters to riding a Ferris wheel overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the beachside streets of Santa Monica have it all. 
If you’re looking to explore the outdoors, hike along the Mt. Hollywood Trail and make your way to the iconic Hollywood sign. At 6.5 miles, the trail is suitable for beginners or those looking for a relatively easy hike. Be sure to carry water and dress accordingly.  
If rugged trails and loading up  on SPF don’t sound alluring, take a walk to Exposition Park, located right across the street from campus. Explore the rose garden or visit the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and  marvel at the dinosaur bones between classes. With blooms of many different colors and a scenic fountain at its heart, the rose garden provides the perfect mini-getaway for a date or staycation.
 
ADVENTURE TO A TOURIST ATTRACTION
The Broad is a contemporary art museum located in downtown L.A. with free admission. Peruse the two-floored gallery and be sure to reserve tickets for Yayoi Kusama’s famous and Instagram-worthy “Infinity Mirrored Room.”
Home to multiple sports teams, and host to countless live artists, the Staples Center is the perfect place to watch dynamic sporting events or attend a live concert. Get tickets for popular performers or even attend a convention centered around a particular interest. 
End the night by trekking to Griffith Observatory for stargazing and astronomical exhibits. The observatory offers gorgeous views of the city and an opportunity to re-enact a scene or two from “La La Land.” The Griffith Observatory also hosts “star parties” once a month where visitors can try out equipment and talk to knowledgable astronomers. 
 
EXPLORE THE WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT
If you’re looking to sate your appetite for comedy or see one of your favorite artists perform, few cities compare to Los Angeles. The city is widely synonymous with the entertainment industry, and there is no shortage of opportunities to entertain oneself.
For music fans, catch a show on at one of the city’s numerous locales. Explore more divey venues — like West Hollywood’s Roxy Theatre or Echo Park’s Echoplex — to more storied locations, such as the famous Hollywood Bowl or USC-adjacent Shrine Auditorium. 
Enjoy an old cult-classic at the American Cinematheque at the Egyptian Theatre. This legendary theatre was built in 1922 and is renowned for its old Hollywood style. It frequently screens independent films and documentaries. Another theatre that boasts the classic Spanish Colonial style is Disney’s El Capitan Theater, which screens previous as well as current Disney films which are often accompanied by performances. The theater’s convenient location on Hollywood Boulevard makes it ideal for a night out, which can end with star-spotting on the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
Whether you’re grabbing lunch at a local eatery with friends or enjoying the outdoors, Los Angeles is the place to be. Make the most of your time in L.A. by exploring everything the city has to offer.

Renowned MC and beatboxer Doug E. Fresh commands the crowd at Los Angeles State Historic Park. (Photo from Instagram)
After the cancellation of this year’s FYF Fest, Southern California festival goers needed a short-term alternative for the dog days of summer. Those prayers were answered in the form of a daylong gathering at Los Angeles State Historic Park.
On Aug. 5, The Growlers invited fans for the seventh annual edition of Beach Goth. The festival, whose name comes from the band’s self-described sound and aesthetic, brought artists and longtime Growlers associates together for a glamorous, albeit morbid, celebration of the Orange County-based band’s career thus far.
The festival’s imagery took obvious influence from artists like Misfits and the Grateful Dead, as well as from the Mexican holiday Día de los Muertos (“Day of the Dead”). Skeletal recreations of pop culture aesthetics served as the backdrop for each stage, from burlesque models and drunken cowboys to a Gothic interpretation of Jesus Christ. 
Attendees could also explore the village of pop-up shops scattered near the festival’s entrance. Among the vendors were Latino-owned clothing brands, band merchandisers and a record store tent by Burger Records, to which The Growlers are signed. 
The eclectic lineup featured artists from diverse musical backgrounds. Early in the day, glam rock oddball Kirin J. Callinan performed at the “Death of a Rat Cabaret” stage sporting a white tank top and chainmail around his head. Callinan’s set at Beach Goth was his first performance in the U.S. in nearly a year. The controversial singer-songwriter has kept a low profile since, an effort reflected in his mid-afternoon set — a stark departure from his typically vivacious onstage presence.
Afterward, GWAR, a metal band often defined by its live theatrics and grotesque costumes, brought its unique brand of shock rock to the main stage. GWAR is known for its comical fake mutilations of celebrities and figures from current events during live performances. At Beach Goth, its victim was a roadie dressed up as President Donald Trump, who spurted fake blood onto the crowd’s frontlines. 
Hip-hop fans were not disappointed at Beach Goth either. MCs Bushwick Bill of Geto Boys and Doug E. Fresh were a breath of fresh air between the swaths of rock acts with their mid-afternoon performances. Bushwick Bill delivered endearing one-liners about his experience with dwarfism and violent interactions with foes past. Meanwhile, Doug E. Fresh brought the cheery raps and exceptional beatboxing that made his career.
The Voidz, led by The Strokes’ frontman Julian Casablancas, played the sunset slot on the main stage and was easily the most memorable performance of the day. The set mostly featured songs from the band’s 2018 LP “Virtue.” Casablancas’ vocals sounded as tortured and charismatic as they have in years. Notably, Casablancas’ songwriting chops with the Voidz were highlighted in the band’s stunning performance. While the versatile band brought influences from metal and experimental rock, the songs maintained their alt-rock accessability. Even so, Casablancas’ background with the Strokes undoubtedly informed the band’s most memorable songs, including highlights “Leave It In My Dreams” and “Lazy Boy.” 
Unfortunately, the audience failed to match the impassioned performance of The Voidz. This gap in energy ultimately flustered Casablancas, whose growing impatience peaked toward the end of the band’s set. He implored his bandmates to hurry and “get the f-ck out of here” upon being informed that two songs were left in the set. Yet, Casablancas and the Voidz finished their set unfazed with heartfelt performances of “Wink” and “Where No Eagles Fly.”
Predictably, The Growlers closed the day’s festivities with an hour-and-a-half-long set that spanned their career highlights, from their 2009 debut “Are You In or Out?” to the recently released “Casual Acquaintances.” Their unique brand of surf-tinged, jangly pop rock pro served as a fitting comedown after a full day in the sun. Beating the Los Angeles State Historic Park’s 10 p.m. curfew by only a few minutes, the band ended its set with the nostalgic cut “Going Gets Tough” from their 2014 album “Chinese Fountain.”
As a whole, the festival succeeded in providing a unique aesthetic and niche lineup to the Southern California festival circuit. While sedated crowds and a disorganized layout detracted from the experience at times, The Growlers should have no issue recreating their glam-goth festival in the foreseeable future.

Seniors Jake Culver, Tom Carpenter and Devan Welsh will release their concept album this September. Photo courtesy of Anastasia Velicescu.
Three piece indie-electronic band Moontower — comprising Thornton School of Music seniors Jake Culver, Tom Carpenter and Devan Welsh — has been on a meteoric rise through the Southern California musical circuit and is poised to distribute its genre-defying sound across a much larger scale.
Each bandmate matriculated at Thornton’s contemporary music degree programs touting lifelong passions for music that came to influence their respective roles in the band. Culver, a music industry major, picked up a toy guitar when he was a toddler and has never put the instrument down, even briefly touring as a guitarist and backup vocalist after high school in his previous band. Carpenter got his first taste of the bass at summer camp and had been producing music since middle school before coming to USC as a music production major. Following a wayward stint on the flute motivated by a futile attempt to impress a girl in fourth grade, Welsh, also a music industry major, took up the guitar and keys and developed an affinity for experimenting with recording technologies. 
Once at USC, the trio began writing and producing for other student artists but soon realized they worked well together and shared similar visions — it didn’t take long for Moontower to become a reality.
“We had this idea for a project where the sound would be a crossover between alternative songwriting and electronic music production,” Culver said. 
Although they aspire to resemble bands they collectively look up to — including Bilderbuch, Daft Punk, Glass Animals, Talking Heads and The Strokes — each member brings a distinct flair to the group. 
“We all bring a very different appreciation of music to the circle,” said Carpenter, whose preferences lay with industrial groove.
“I just write really sad lyrics and let Tom and Dev put big dance beats behind it,” admits Culver, the pop aficionado.
Welsh, who is partial to stadium rock, considers himself the most analog-savvy band member. “I like going back to the keys and guitar elements of the song and trying to bring melody back into things,” he said. “The thing about dance is it can be very repetitive if you don’t introduce these groove elements into it.”
The meaning behind Moontower’s name very much reflects its internal diversity and fusion of musical talents. A reference to the site of the iconic “party at moon tower” scene from the 1993 comedic film “Dazed and Confused,” Moontower implies a melting pot of personalities and represents a gathering place for people from all walks of life.
“The idea is that it’s somewhere where no matter what grade or social scene you’re in everybody’s allowed to go there and mingle and have a good time,” Culver said. “We found it fit in really well into the ethos of what we’re trying to do here. We wanted to provide something that was unique and cool but also not exclusionary. On the surface level, we just want people to come to our shows and let loose.” 
To that end, the guys cite the vibrancy and supportiveness of the USC community as the primary catalyst to their early success. Moontower’s manager, Carina Glastris, is a Spring 2018 graduate and the former director of Concerts Committee, while the band’s lighting and visual effects engineer since its very first show, Jacob Fishman (endearingly dubbed “Fish”), is a senior at the Iovine & Young Academy. From playing on-campus gigs like Thornton Friday Night Live and Trojan Vision to haggling with Department of Public Safety officers at every local house party show, the essence of Moontower was forged in the heart of the Trojan Family. 
“There are so many things we’ve learned from USC; for example, don’t project the visuals over the audience so that they can’t see it, it’s not a great call,” Carpenter recalled. “We’ve done kind of the whole USC circuit and that’s how we got started. We wouldn’t be anything without the USC community.”
“Not that we’re necessarily anything yet, but USC gave us this place to just try sh-t, play for our friends and make fans,” Culver added. 
Thanks to Moontower’s origins performing in backyards and living rooms for hundreds of college students, its current roster of shows in front of 1,000-member audiences seem far less daunting. In recent months, Moontower has shared the stage with artists such as Bad Suns, YUNGBLUD and MAGIC GIANT. 
“This project feels different, like there’s some weight behind it and [like] there’s magic in the air a little bit,” Culver said.
The magic happens within the walls of an inconspicuous house on Menlo Avenue occupied by the trio, their friends and some members of their production team. The guys say that being roommates is astronomically conducive to their creative processes. In fact, nothing — no school work and certainly no songwriting — would get done without living together. 
A typical song is first composed on piano or acoustic guitar; a stripped-down version replete with chords, melody and lyrics must exist before the guys start layering on more flavorful dimensions. Most demos are 80 percent complete in the first two hours while the final 20 percent of details can take up to six additional months.
“[When we’re writing a song] we have this meshing process that keeps going until we end up with Moontower’s sound, which never sounds right until everyone has put their hands on it,” Carpenter said.
Moontower’s second and most recent single, “Leaving You Behind,” was written by Culver and Carpenter in just 20 minutes and debuted in July with a sold-out release party that drew over 300 attendees. The track sends a melancholic, yet positive message about making the best of a bad situation, and supersedes the inaugural single “William,” which now boasts over 200,000 streams on Spotify. 
Both tracks revolve around themes of love, loss, crushed expectations and frustrating outcomes, set against the familiar backdrop of American suburbia. The titular “William” refers to one of the trio’s close friends and housemates, William Hollywood, who not only inspired them to tell a personal story through him but also directed and starred in the music video and designed the album covers. 
“In a lot of ways William was someone we were able to tell our story through,” Culver said. “We found that we all had very similar experiences growing up. This first record about William is about our shared experiences of love and suburbia, and dealing with the false expectations of what relationships are supposed to look like.” 
The debut single’s hand-illustrated artwork features a solid orange border and a cartoonish carton of orange juice — a testament to the feelings of domesticity and childhood nostalgia Moontower hopes to procure through its music. For Culver, it’s also a reference to his upbringing in Orange County and his father’squirky habit of drinking orange juice every night. 
Keeping with the motif of suburbia and youthful innocence, “Leaving You Behind” is branded with a drawing of a retro car (also orange) meant to evoke the thrill and freedom associated with obtaining one’s license. 
Along with a third single, Moontower’s 22-minute concept album, wittily titled “Season 1: The Ballad of William Hollywood,” is set  for release in September. The album chronicles the journey of a teenage character who serves as a projection of the bandmates’ own upbringings and adolescent experiences. Orange juice will, in fact, be a significant plot point, Carpenter hinted. 
“This is going to be our very best attempt at a concept album,” Welsh said. “The fact that we’ve been able to agree upon subject matter and a storyline and all the small details, it’s gonna be amazing to have that out as a cohesive unit of our production and storytelling.” 
Each track on the album will be accompanied by a music video; altogether, they will form a visual episodic narrative of William’s adventures. But individually, they will offer refreshing vignettes of a young man’s coming of age. 
“We’re trying to start at the beginning of our lives — and William’s life — and as our music evolves, we’re gonna go chronologically through our experiences as people,” Culver said. “The overall theme of this record is relationships that are doomed to fail because we haven’t grown into ourselves enough to truly understand what we need to love somebody.”
However, as Moontower matures, the trio hopes to evolve its sound to reflect the new, deep connections they are continually forging with fans. Traditional formalities and metaphorical walls between Moontower and its fans are broken down by the sheer shared enjoyment of music, the guys say.
“We want to tie in the experiences of the people that we meet because this project is about being on the road, meeting people, learning about the human experience authentically and then retelling that,” Culver said. “Our favorite aspect is getting to meet our fans and making new fans after the show.”
With regard to the human experience, the members of Moontower also feel a responsibility as musicians to take a stand in favor of gun control; recent mass shootings at concerts, including the 2017 tragedy at Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, particularly hit home for them. To this end, they have publicly encouraged youth activism and voter registration at their shows, hoping to influence legislators but more immediately to ensure their fans feel safe at concerts. 
From performing on yachts to inspiring a couple to come out to each other at one of its shows, Moontower has come a long way since its inception. In the coming year, the guys are more eager than ever to bring their music to USC and other campuses, grow their relationships with fans and get on the road touring with bigger bands to see as much of the country as possible. Ultimately, as demonstrated by its upcoming album, commitment to social causes and mission to tell human stories, the core of Moontower is and always will be, as they put it, “about the people.”

Village for all · Beginning this fall two-bedroom loft units at USC Village will feature a new furniture system. Although lofts are smaller than regular dorms, the new furniture will allow students to maximize their living space. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
It started as an idea for her own loft. Now, it’s the latest update to USC Village.
Veronica Matthews, a sophomore majoring in business administration, turned the steps of her bunk bed into storage space and the top step into cushioned seating. Her simple innovation has now turned into USC Housing’s new space-saving furniture system for loft-style units at USC Village. 
Instead of metal ladders, the new loft beds will come with furniture informally called “Veronica” staircases, named after Matthews herself. 
She said the concept was inspired by a combination of her childhood love for bunk beds and her desire to ameliorate issues of comfortability, seating and storage in the reduced-size rooms. 
“When I was younger, I wondered why [bunk beds] didn’t have slides attached to them because slides would have been a great addition,” Matthews said. “Although [looking into slides] initially started as a joke, it led me to the idea of stairs.”
Matthews proposed the cabinet-staircase idea to her parents and eventually turned her vision into a reality.
“We found the person who would make the staircases on Etsy,” she said. “I didn’t need a super fancy set; I just needed something that would work for the year.”
After going through the process and acquiring the additional furniture, Matthews pitched the idea to Daniel Moran, a senior associate director for USC Village housing. 
Moran supported the technology and after a few months of designing, engineering and testing prototypes, the University finally approved a design.

“We pride ourselves on being early adopters of new technologies and are always looking for ways to improve our amenities in USC Housing,” Moran said. “When we saw the reaction to the ‘Veronica’  [staircase] during our USC Housing tour last November, it was obvious that this idea was what we needed to take an unpopular unit and vastly improve it.”
According to Moran, the metal ladders being replaced will be sent to the manufacturers for repurposing to support the University’s efforts to avoid sending furniture to landfills. 
“I appreciate that USC Housing realized that the original loft furniture was problematic and chose to swap it out,” said Jessica Milton, a junior who previously lived in a loft. 
Moran added that the new loft design has been a hit with freshmen touring USC Village.
“We had never had a reaction like that before in the decade we have been taking freshmen on tours of upperclassmen housing units,” Moran said.
