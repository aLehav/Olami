Celebrating a blend of music and fashion with a youthful touch, Gearfest: 1000 Phases of Venus will grace McCarthy Quad tonight at 7 p.m. Celebrities Teyana Taylor and Taj Stransberry will host the show, which is presented by the Black Student Association and features student and professional artists and designers showcasing their artistic talents.
“The BSA created this show to showcase beauty on the USC campus while promoting up-and-coming designers in the Los Angeles area,” said Alanah Joseph, the head of Gearfest fashion production and a junior majoring in communication. “We aimed to produce a highly innovative show this year to test our own boundaries, and those of our audiences.”
Highlights of the show include performances from Casey Veggies and Jhene Aiko, and opening acts flaunt a diverse mix of genres from USC student artists, such as the R&B/rap sounds of Jay Sneed, Rhyon Brown and Big Rik Locc to the Jazz Ensemble of 1923.
Both professional and student models will walk the runway for the fashion show with collections from student and local designers, including Macnificent Collection, Simply Sporty, DOH Quest and Culterati Clothing.
Magnificent Collection co-founder and USC student Raymond Courtney is proud to contribute the new styles of his label on the runway. It’s a step that celebrates his hometown of Los Angeles while leading him one step closer to becoming a known designer.
“Magnificent is a multicultural brand that is the incorporation of my own styles along with the design techniques I have been learning in school, said Courtney, a junior majoring in fine art. “I’m excited to show everybody my vision and continue to build my brand as a young entrepreneur.”
Designer-merchandise tents, a VIP section and a red carpet leading down from the Von Kleinsmid Center to McCarthy Quad, Gearfest is sure to showcase a night of entertainment and show appreciation for a diverse group of attendees.
“We’ve worked really hard this year to select unique talent, sponsors and designers whose brands all communicate the same message of positivity and young entrepreneurship,” said Courtney Manning, the head of public relations for Gearfest and a junior majoring in public relations.
Students said they are excited to see how Gearfest, which took a hiatus last year, will come back new and improved.
“I’m hoping to see some fresh new styles for the spring and also see some of the new local artists like Casey veggies,” said Brittnie Marcell, a junior majoring in communication. “I’m excited to see the new changes that have been made since last year and [to see] how they have incorporated ‘1000 Shades of Venus.’”
The “1000 Phases of Venus” theme symbolizes the legacy of Sarah Saartje Baartman, known under her stage name of “Venus,” who was on display as one of the most famous freak show attractions in 19th-century Europe. Gearfest hopes to transform the theme by dedicating it to celebrating African-American beauty.
Joseph said she is proud of the dedication of the committee this year, and is excited to help increase the presence of cultural art and expression through the work of some of USC’s, and Los Angeles’, finest young minds.
“I hope that the Trojan Family will enjoy the fruits of our committee’s hard work and walk away with a greater appreciation for African-American music and fashion,” Joseph said.

The Hunger Games was a huge success.
Not only financially – blowing away the competition with over $155 million in box office receipts – but critically as well.  It’s no surprise that Lionsgate immediately greenlit the sequels Catching Fire and Mockingjay to begin shooting as soon as possible.
There are those who feel that The Hunger Games is a violent tragedy, which shouldn’t be shown to children, hence the PG-13 rating. Well trust me, the next two novels are even darker.
You think that sending twenty-four children into an arena to fight to the death is “dark?” Add in some civil war, nuclear devices, suicide to save someone else’s life, murdering a huge group of children, brainwashing and a whole bunch of other things and you get the next two novels.
Lionsgate has toyed with the idea of separating each novel into two more films, vaguely reminiscient of that other teen series, Twilight. In this case, Panem fans will have four more films to look forward to.
This idea is both good and bad: for one, the first film was a bit too long for many people, and they cut out a bunch of plot points and character development.
I think that Catching Fire can very well be turned into one film. Author Suzanne Collins’ writing style is incredibly addictive. It is also, however, incredibly repetitive.
Mockingjay, however, needs to see the two-film treatment. Too much of the novel is character enrichment, parts where characters are simply silent and thinking, important pieces of dialogue that not only further the story along but also build the character to become someone real.
The Hunger Games trilogy is an action read, for sure, but what makes us feel for the characters are all of those smaller bits of humanity. And if a film rushes through those key points, then we’re left watching Transformers – we won’t care at all about who’s dying onscreen.
No matter which way Lionsgate goes, the next films are sure to be a huge box office draw. Let’s just hope that they’re as good as the first one.

Since her appearance on the music scene in 2001, soul singer-songwriter Goapele (Gwa-pa-lay) remains one of the most underrated artists in recent R&B history. Her debut album Closer, while garnering respect from critics and lovers of music outside of the mainstream, went largely unnoticed, and, with an equally overlooked second album, Change it All, it seemed as though the singer’s budding career had ended before it truly got started.
Now, almost ten years after her debut, Goapele is back.
Described by Rolling Stone as the “spiritual love child of Sade and D’Angelo,” Goapele is a direct contrast to an industry where vocal talent doesn’t seem to be a priority. She doesn’t dance or even cradle a guitar, but she does get down to basics. Her voice, sometimes subtle sometimes gritty, doesn’t sound like anyone else’s, and it slides over her well-crafted lyrics effortlessly.
“With this third album I’ve pushed myself to sing more outside my comfort zone,” Goapele said on her website, “I’m not afraid to belt or be more sensual and intimate vocally.”
Though Goapele’s third album, Break of Dawn, actually dropped this past October, the music video for her latest single, “Tears on My Pillow,” hit YouTube and VEVO Tuesday evening, revealing a classy but sexy Goapele and an abstract portrayal of lost love. The music video features smoking suitcases, awkwardly stacked chairs, and flashing light bulbs —all coming together to match the heartbreaking moodiness of Goapele’s laid-back love song.
“Tears on My Pillow” marks the third music video from Break of Dawn and is arguably the best. The first video, “Milk and Honey,” prematurely released in 2009, presented a glammed-up, uncomfortably awkward Goapele that contrasted sharply with her chill, earthy, girl-next-door image from 2002’s “Closer.”   Nevertheless, the song “Milk and Honey” remained catchy and original enough to earn a spot on Break of Dawn two years after the video premiere.
Then came “Play,” a more upbeat track that meshed Goapele’s seemingly opposing images from “Closer” and “Milk and Honey.” In the video, Goapele rocks a series of minimalist outfits while images of a contortionist, a chess game, and a writhing snake play in the background —this girl is all about the details.
Even with apparent growth over the consecutive releases of her music videos, Goapele manages to maintain a consistency in style and attitude. Her provocative lyrics remain just as original and soul-shattering as in her earlier days, and she continues to follows a trend of heavy imagery in her music videos; instead of breaking out choreography or flashy costumes, Goapele relies on sincere facial expressions and odd representations of her lyrics, which provides food for thought as well as entertainment for viewers.
To be certain, some of her nonconformity probably results from the fact that she owns her own record label, Skyblaze.
Or, she could just be an artist with something fresh and original to say.
Goapele has tour dates planned for San Francisco this May.
