For a split second, Zach Maynard almost made it close.
With the Golden Bears trailing USC 20-0 late in the second quarter, the Cal quarterback completed three straight passes, moving the ball down to the USC 10-yard line. On the next play, however, the junior signal caller’s pass was intercepted by freshman linebacker Dion Bailey, preserving the Trojans’ near three-touchdown lead heading into halftime.
“We had to come out and show everybody we’re not as bad a defense as everybody says we are,” Bailey said of his first of two interceptions.
The Trojans’ defense forced five turnovers at California (3-3, 0-3), edging the host Golden Bears 30-9 in front of a crowd of 44,043 at AT&T Park in San Francisco. Prior to Thursday night’s contest, USC (5-1, 3-1) had forced just four turnovers in five games.
“If I was going to pick a way to win a game, I would rather win it this way because it instills confidence in our defense,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
The defense – to put it lightly – had appeared out of sync in recent weeks.
In their last two games, the Trojans allowed a combined 84 points. Against Cal, however, they surrendered just 329 total yards and one touchdown for a season-low nine points.
Though the Golden Bears’ oft-heralded receiving duo of sophomore Keenan Allen and senior Marvin Jones combined for 19 receptions for 249 yards, neither was able to haul in a touchdown pass.
“They’re a heck of a team coming in and we were nervous about their two receivers,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “But we did a good job. If you turn the ball over that much, it’s really hard to win games.”
Cal did make a late third-quarter run – similar to other second-half defensive struggles for USC against Arizona State and Arizona, where it was outscored in the final two quarters. Opening the third quarter with a 23-yard field goal from freshman kicker Andre Heidari, which ballooned its lead to 23 points, USC watched Cal respond with a field goal of its own followed by a three-yard touchdown run from Maynard.
But despite cutting the Trojans’ lead to just two possessions, Maynard would watch Bailey intercept another pass midway through the fourth quarter. The turnover would set up a two-yard touchdown run from junior tailback Curtis McNeal that largely put the game out of reach.
“He’s playing really well,” Kiffin said of McNeal who led the team in rushing on the night with 86 yards on 17 carries.
Collectively, though, USC’s offense looked much less than potent than it did in its last game Oct. 1 at home against Arizona. Barkley, who broke the school single-game record for passing yards with 468 against the Wildcats, threw for just 195 yards Thursday. He did not, however, throw an interception.
“I played alright,” Barkley said of his performance. “Not good enough to win big games, but always something to improve upon.”
The junior signal caller – though throwing two touchdown passes – completed just 54 percent of his passes, his lowest completion percentage of any game of the season thus far.
“Just the little things were off,” he said. “I either put too much air under it or not enough.”
The Trojans, even while jumping out to an early lead, finished with just 313 yards of total offense and were outgained by Cal.
“We’re not happy with how the game went, but we’re 5-1, so you have to remember that too,” Kiffin said.
The Trojans, who travel to South Bend next weekend to face Notre Dame, winners of four straight since opening the season 0-2, remain content – at least somewhat – with five wins halfway through the season.
“It’s huge,” Barkley said. “You kind of feel bad because of our performance today, but when you look at the scores, you’ll see that we won by three scores, the defense played awesome and that we are 5-1, which is huge.”

Based on last nights game – God help the Trojans
against Notre Dame, Stanford and Oregon !

David Stainton, formerly the President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, has been appointed President of Paramount’s up-and-coming in-house animation division, the company announced Oct. 10.
Mr. Stainton’s experience, which includes 17 years at Disney, is expected to be extremely useful for the fledgling Paramount Animation. According to a press release on the appointment, he helmed several dozen releases that brought in $3.5 billion in revenue worldwide.
He is credited with spearheading Disney’s transition to fully digital animation production from its hand-drawn roots. He also managed the company’s 150-strong animation facility in Paris. After leaving Disney, he founded Henry’s World Media, a family entertainment company, in January 2007. He had been serving as its CEO prior to this new role at Paramount.
Paramount’s animation division is still in a nascent stage, having been established in July 2011. Prior to its launch, Paramount acted mainly as distributors for Dreamworks in the animated feature market.
However, there were disagreements over financial aspects of the deal following the launch of Paramount Animation. The new launch, coupled with the company’s stated aim to release a movie of its own by 2014 did not help matters. The two parties failed to find a solution to the impasse, and no extension was signed for the deal, which ends in 2012.
While Paramount Animation might be a new division, Paramount has released several successful animation films in its history. Rango, starring Johnny Depp and released in March 2011, was its first fully owned CGI animated feature film. The movie received critical acclaim, while raking in a little under a quarter million dollars at the box office.
Paramount’s next major release will be the Steven Spielberg-directed The Adventures of Tintin later this year.
 “David’s accomplishments speak for themselves, and I am glad to welcome him to the lot as we start this exciting new chapter,” said Goodman in the press release. “With David’s leadership, we will look to build on what has been a very strong year for our studio in animation, with Rango and the upcoming Adventures of Tintin pointing to the kind of artist-driven, broad-appeal films we intend to make at Paramount Animation.”

Health insurance provider Blue Shield of California will return $295 million in profits to its customers, fulfilling a pledge it made in June to cap all its profits at 2 percent of revenue.
Policyholders will receive the money mostly in credits on future insurance bills. Blue Shield executives say the move is an effort to curb rising health care costs in the face of increasing insurance company profits.
“Today’s announcement provides more tangible evidence that we’re putting affordability before profit,” Bruce Bodaken, chief executive officer of Blue Shield, told the Los Angeles Times. “We hope our action will inspire others in the healthcare industry to look for ways to make quality healthcare more affordable.”
The company had originally planned to return $180 million this month based on profits from 2010, but new estimates on 2011 revenue raised the amount returned to customers.
President Barack Obama’s administration voiced its support for Blue Shield’s pledge.
“This announcement will provide some much needed relief to families who have seen their premiums increase in recent years,” said Nancy-Ann DeParle, deputy chief of staff for policy.
On average, a family of four will see a reduction of about $420 in December’s premium, but the refund could mean as much as $700 for some.
Blue Shield’s revenue refund comes before a provision of the Affordable Care Act kicks in next year, which would require that all health insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of customers’ premiums on health care – and not administrative costs or profit. Any money not spent on health care that falls under the required amount must be returned to policyholders.

The Government Law Organization hosted California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer as he spoke to law and undergrad students Wednesday.
Lockyer served 25 years in the state legislature and was California’s Attorney General from 1996 to 2006. Under his guidance, the state’s $70 billion Pooled Money Investment Account made it through the recession without losing any principal.
The audience, comprising mostly students from the Gould School of Law, were shocked to learn Lockyer took law school classes at night — at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento — while working for the State Legislature, fresh out of the University of California, Berkeley. It took Lockyer seven years to get his J.D., although he took a year off to run for Senate.
Most  anecdotes from Lockyer’s talk had a light-hearted feel, especially one about his first case in front of the Supreme Court. Lockyer claimed speaking in front of the Supreme Court had always been a dream of his, but he joked about asking his colleagues to not give him “anything super hard or crazy.”
Lockyer also encouraged current law students to give some serious thought to the specific “niche” of law that suits them best.
“Most lawyers are miserable,” said Lockyer, greeted by some nervous laughs. “But it can also be wonderfully interesting work if you can find the niche that you find satisfying.”
G.L.O. co-founder Blanca Hernandez, who introduced Lockyer to the audience, sounded off on the many positives she hoped the students could take away from the State Treasurer’s visit.
“I am very proud that he embodies the type of alternative careers G.L.O. seeks to amplify and expose at USC,” said Hernandez.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary of Tuesday, Oct. 10.
Crimes against property
At 4:45 p.m., DPS officers responded to a student who reported that he discovered his bicycle, which he had previously reported stolen, secured to a rack outside Mark Taper Hall of Humanities with a lock that did not belong to him. The officers confirmed that the bike was registered to the student and when they contacted the student who had locked it to the rack he claimed that his mother had purchased it for him. The bike was then confiscated by the officers and returned to the original owner.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 9:08 p.m., DPS officers responded to a traffic collision at 2600 Hoover Street involving two vehicles, one of which was driven by a student. The non-USC female driving the second vehicle did not complain of any injuries, but she was pregnant and an LAFD RA unit was requested as a precaution. RA Unit #15 responded and examined the female, then transported her to California Hospital Medical Center for medical treatment. The student was not injured. LAPD officers were also requested and responded to conduct a traffic investigation.
At 7:47 p.m., a staff member reported that he advised a suspect who was loitering outside the Carol Little Building to leave the premises. The suspect complied, but stated that he will return and his demeanor caused the staff member to fear for his safety.
At 6:26 p.m., DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC female who passed out in a restroom at James H. Zumberge Hall of Science. The female was unresponsive when contacted by the officers, so an LAFD RA unit was requested. RA Unit #46 responded and examined the female, then transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment.

Hip-hop is more than just rhyming raps, loaded lyrics, booming beats and mic-blowing MCs — it’s also a cultural community, which is celebrated every year at the BET Hip Hop Awards.
This year’s pre-taped award show, which aired on BET Oct. 11, brought legends, moguls and newcomers in the game to Atlanta’s Boisfeuillet Jones Civic Center on Oct. 1.
Host Mike Epps kept viewers roaring with laughter between award announcements, honors and the highly anticipated hip hop cyphers, which featured 41 underground and well-known MCs freestyling over tracks spun by DJ Premier.
In addition to the cyphers, a series of live performances — including ones by Young Jeezy, T.I., Wiz Khalifa, Rick Ross, DMX, Big Sean, Lupe Fiasco and Heavy D — featured lyrics from the old-school ’80s to the mainstream 2000s.
The champion of the night was R&B artist and part-time rapper Chris Brown, who took home Best Hip Hop Video, Best Collaboration and People’s Chance Award for his 2011 hit featuring Lil’ Wayne and Busta Rhymes “Look At Me Now.” In second place was Louisiana-born rapper Lil’ Wayne, who won the Lyricist of the Year and Best Live Performer awards.
BET honored rapper-turned-actor LL Cool J as this year’s recipient of the I AM Hop Hop award, given to the artist who has had a significant musical and cultural influence on the hip hop community. In his one-of-a-kind acceptance speech, the MC set aside Hollywood and reconnected with his musical talents, reciting an inspirational rap that yielded him a standing ovation and endless applause.

Will USC’s offensive line hold up against Cal?
During the week, junior quarterback Matt Barkley indicated that USC’s offensive line play will dictate the outcome of the game. He believes that if the protection is solid, he should be able to pick apart the Cal defense. Through the first five games, the Trojans’ line has caught some flack for its lack of dominance in the trenches. However, Barkley has only been sacked four times to date.
 
Who will be the best receiver on the field? 
Fans of the aerial attack are in for a treat. Thursday’s contest features the top two receivers in the Pac-12. USC’s sophomore sensation Robert Woods is tied for the national lead in receptions per game with 11. Cal’s sophomore standout Keenan Allen is not far behind, ranked 11th nationally. Both were highly touted recruits, and they have performed extremely well in their young careers. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Allen spoke about the matchup. “I definitely look forward to it,” he said. “We’re both good athletes. I met him at the All-American camp. We hung out. I’m going to come out there and compete. He’s obviously faster than I am, but I can make some moves.
 
Can Maynard provide consistent quarterback play for the Golden Bears?
At the beginning of Tedford’s tenure, Cal rose to national relevance, culminating in a tie for first in the Pac-10 in 2006. However, the Bears have struggled since then largely due to inconsistent quarterback play. Tedford is known as a quarterback guru, developing the likes of Trent Dilfer and Aaron Rodgers. Nevertheless, consistency under center has eluded him as of late. Zach Maynard is a dual threat quarterback, and Tedford selected Maynard as the starter because of his versatility. However, the head coach has not utilized Maynard in that fashion so far. Among Pac-12 quarterbacks, Maynard ranks last in completion percentage. If he can’t find his receivers against a shaky USC secondary, it could be a long day for the Bears.
 
Does Jeff Tedford finally have a recipe to beat USC? 
Historically, Cal has struggled against USC. The Golden Bears have only registered fifteen wins against the Trojans since World War II. In Tedford’s second year—2003—Cal upset USC in a triple overtime thriller in Berkeley. Since then the Bears have struggled mightily against the Trojans, and Tedford is 1-8 in his career against USC. A year ago, USC steam rolled the Bears in a 48-14 drubbing that saw USC take a 42-0 lead in to the half. “No matter who plays, it’s always a challenge against those guys,” Tedford said of playing USC.
 
How will George Farmer contribute to the Trojan’s offense?
Earlier in the year, Lane Kiffin announced that Farmer, the top wide receiver recruit in the nation, would redshirt. In practice, Farmer worked at running back with the scout team, and Kiffin loved what he saw. Farmer’s performance in practice combined with Kiffin’s frustration with the running game could translate in to playing time this week for the freshman. There is speculation that Farmer will receiving significant playing time in an effort to add an explosive dimension to the running back position.

When it comes to job opportunities, the class of 2012 could be better off than its 2011 counterpart.
According to U.S. News and World Report, employers surveyed by the National Association of Colleges and Employers said they plan to hire 9.5 percent more graduates from the class of 2012 than they did from the class of 2011.
The projected increase in hiring also brings positive news about salaries. The NACE Fall 2011 Salary Survey shows this year’s class of graduates will make, on average, about 6 percent more than last year’s graduates, from just more than $48,000 to just more than $51,000.
The survey also reported that engineering students from the class of 2012 will make $1,688 more than engineering students from the class of 2011.
“The economic recovery has been a drawn out and difficult one and employment has suffered in ways that are deeper and longer from a more typical recessionary cycle,” said Carl Martellino, executive director of the USC Career Center.
He also said there are signs of improvement, as demonstrated by the NACE survey.
“The recession of 2008 shows signs, small ones, but noted ones, on the hiring front,” he said. “The more jobs available, the better for everyone … This is particularly true for individuals with a college degree. Overall, the unemployment rate for individuals who hold a college degree is about half of the overall national average.”
This trend is especially evident at USC, where employers continue to hire through the on-campus recruiting program at the Career Center, he said.
“The recent fall Career Fair was a wonderfully positive bellwether, with over 170 organizations attending,” Martellino said. “In fact, this was one of the largest career fairs at USC and the largest since the economic downturn of 2008 … While conditions can always change, this is a very positive indication that things are improving for college graduates.”
According to Martellino, USC students can “stand out above others” by using the resources available on campus. He said employers want to see a strong academic background coupled with real world experiences, which students usually gain through internships.
Martellino also emphasized the importance of utilizing the Trojan Family when seeking employment.
“Attending workshops and presentations where employers and alumni are speaking is an important step in building your network,” Martellino said. “Your classmates are part of your network as are your faculty, family and friends.”
Evelyn Larios, a senior majoring in sociology and public policy, management and planning, said she thinks the increase in employment opportunities will affect students in a positive way.
“It will give them an incentive to graduate on time because I’ve noticed that seniors sometimes stay another semester to pick up another major because they [think] it’s better to have those when you go apply to the [job] market,” Larios said. “It will actually give more energy to the students and let them know that when you leave college, there’s likely to be a job out there for you.”
Josephine Chou, a senior majoring in psychology, on the other hand, is skeptical of the NACE survey results and what they mean for the class of 2012.
“The first question that comes to my mind is why they say that they’re going to hire more from the current graduating class,” she said. “I wonder if they mean they’re going to be hiring more during the next year, but I don’t know if that necessarily means that my class will get hired because we have less experience than the class before us.”
She said many of her peers are trying to keep other options open.
“A lot of people, including myself, are applying for grad school, but on the other hand, we’re also applying for jobs and seeing which offer comes,” she said. “Then we’ll try to make a decision.”
Larios, who said she is also considering graduate school, is not particularly worried about employment after graduation.
“Once you know what you really want to do and whether the work route really is the route for you or grad school or something else is the route for you, then you kind of become less worried about it,” Larios said.

Though animals are not often seen on campus, many students still appreciate the idea of allowing pets on campus.
Puppies took over Alumni Park Wednesday when USC’s Net Impact and MOVE presented “Pet a Pup for Life,” a fundraising event in which students donated money to Heifer International, a nonprofit organization devoted to ending poverty through sustainable methods.

Event coordinators said they raised $477 from the approximately 150 students who came. A professor pledged to donate however much the organization needed to reach its $500 goal before the event took place.
USC does allow pets to visit campus as long as they don’t enter buildings. Dogs on campus must also be leashed and picked up after, in accordance with Los Angeles sanitation requirements, according to USC’s University Policy website.
Phoebe Abraham, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said the campus landscape is moderately suitable for pet owners.
“The campus is somewhat pet-friendly,” Abraham said. “There are some grassy areas, like McCarthy Quad, that have a great stretch of land for pets to roam around in and play and just have fun.”
Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Logan Lachman said her “campaign dog,” a friend’s labrador mix named Murray, helped her and USG President Monish Tyagi connect with students on Trousdale Parkway during last semester’s elections.
“People were really excited to see the dog,” Lachman said. “It definitely helped attract people so we could talk to them about our campaign. I’m also personally a huge fan of dogs, so I’m sure having this positive image with us helped.”
Cathy Casillas, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said she has to keep her French bulldog at her family house in Pasadena because USC does not allow pets in university housing. She said being able to live with her pet would make her happier.
“Pets are such a great way to relieve stress,” Casillias said. “I’m not saying that everyone should have a pet because some people just can’t handle the responsibilities, but it would be nice to have the pet option.”
Ivy Habaradas, a junior majoring in music industry, lives in a non-USC apartment and owns a dog. She said she doesn’t bring her dog to campus because she’s afraid she would get in trouble if it pooped, but loves coming home to her pomeranian-poodle mix.
“When I come home tired from school, she comes running toward me,” Habaradas said. “Then I’m not tired anymore.”
Other students feel differently about the situation. Danielle Tomfohrde, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she looked the other way when some people in her building, Fluor Tower, had a rabbit during the fall semester last year.
“It was cute in the beginning,” Tomfohrde said. “Then it peed on my sweatpants, and it was not OK anymore. A lot of people turned the other way to allow it to be there, but when you think about it, the policies USC housing has regarding pets are really reasonable and should be followed.”
Tomfohrde said she was happy to see the rabbit leave.
“I couldn’t go into the common room because there was poop all over the place and I wasn’t sure if I would step in something I didn’t want to be stepping in,” she said. “It was disgusting.”
Some students said USC doesn’t need to encourage students to bring more animals on campus in general. Francesca Martens, a junior majoring in classics, said it’s a nuanced situation.
“It would be nice,” Martens said. “But it would be a little problematic because of the noise and poop if people don’t clean up after their pets.”
Some students, however, expressed interest in having pets around campus. Ty Vestal, a senior majoring in biological sciences and psychology, said students seem to enjoy it when he walks his corgi, Leo, around campus.
“Most people love him and come up to him to pet him,” Vestal said. “But there’s definitely people who are not OK with dogs, so I keep him on a short leash when they go by.”
Having a pet can be a very rewarding experience, Vestal said.
“It’s having another companion in life,” Vestal said. “It’s great to be able to bounce love and affection off of another creature.”
Congrats!! this is amazing
