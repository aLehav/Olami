The Marshall School of Business announced Tuesday it will launch a new Masters of Science in Social Entrepreneurship program beginning fall 2014.
The program, established by Marshall’s Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab, aims to educate students who hope to solve social problems such as poverty, education and gender equity by creating their own enterprise or working for an existing enterprise.
“The new Master of Science in Social Entrepreneurship will further our goals by offering advanced study in business, entrepreneurship and social impact,” said Adlai Wertman, the founding director of the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab and a professor with joint appointments at USC Marshall and USC’s Rossier School of Education, in a statement.
“It’s a program for people who want to change the world,” said Abby Fifer Mandell, the lab’s executive director.
During the five years that the lab has been on USC’s campus, Fifer Mandell said Wertman has taught a graduate introductory course in social entrepreneurship through Marshall that has always filled up quickly.
“We’ve encountered students from all around the university and in the community who are really seeking these kinds of business courses to give them the skills and the confidence they need to start their own enterprise or work at a social enterprise,” said Fifer Mandell. “That’s why we created this program.”
The program — which does not require business experience nor completion of GRE or GMAT — can be completed in one year or multiple years if students choose to enroll part-time. All courses will be held in the evening and weekends to accommodate students who wish to work full time.
Adlai’s social enterprise course will serve as the foundation of the program along with six other required courses. Students can then choose from a series of elective courses in areas such as leadership, sales management or environmental sustainability in which they hope to specialize.
The program’s capstone course requires students to create a business plan for a new social enterprise.
Fifer Mandell said that, though universities across the country may offer similar programs in schools of public policy, education or international relations, USC is the first to offer such a program at a business school that will focus on aspects of marketing and finance.
“There are a lot of people out there who are interested in the field of social entrepreneurship,” she said. “A student who has a great idea of a social enterprise [he or she] wants to launch can come in this program and within a year have taken all of the courses, met industry leaders in the field, have a great network, have a community of like minded students that share their vision for how they think the world should be and have a business plan for the idea that they want to pursue.”

With the most romantic day of the year falling on Friday, this weekend’s three new releases are, unsurprisingly, romances.
About Last Night, starring Kevin Hart, will most likely come out on top as the only comedy. The star-studded Winter’s Tale, helmed by Academy Award-winning writer Akiva Goldsman, may not be a big draw due to poor reviews and a relative lack of marketing. This weekend’s final new release, Endless Love, also received poor reviews, and suffers the added handicap of a lack of star power to attract fans.
About Last Night tells the story of two couples looking to navigate the world of new love after meeting at a bar. Three of the four main cast members (Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy and Regina Hall) were involved in the 2012 film Think Like A Man, which was successful enough that a sequel, Think Like A Man Too, is scheduled for a June 2014 release. While it seems like they may have a winning formula, it does help that Kevin Hart, who has been pure box office gold this year, leads the charge. His latest film, Ride Along, stood atop the box office standings for several weeks and is still in theaters.
Winter’s Tale, adapted from the 1983 Mark Helprin novel of the same name, tells the story of a thief who falls in love with a dying woman and time travels between the year 1916 and present-day Manhattan. Despite an all-star cast including Colin Farrell, Russell Crowe, Will Smith and Jessica Brown Findlay (of Downton Abbey fame), the film received mostly negative reviews. The cast might bring in audiences, but the film will likely end up being a box office flop.
Endless Love, a remake of a 1981 film of the same name, seems to be just another typical romantic drama. Starring Alex Pettyfer, recently in Lee Daniels’ The Butler and Magic Mike, and Gabriella Wilde, recently in Carrie, Endless Love tells the story of a wealthy girl who falls into love with a charismatic boy, despite their parents’ attempts to keep them apart. It sounds like another cliché love story, and judging from early reviews, it probably is. While its targeted female audience may contribute to the film’s box office pull, the poor reviews will probably prevent this film from making a strong push this weekend.
Rather, expect another remake, Robocop, which came out Wednesday, to dominate the new releases.
An action/sci-fi film released on Valentine’s Day wouldn’t get much traction, but the early release might be able to give it some momentum going into President’s Day weekend. As a sci-fi film, it would be the only new release that targets a male demographic. Some critics question why it was even made. Interestingly, it will most likely fare better this weekend than the other new releases.
With the exception of About Last Night, none of this week’s releases have received positive reviews. With its electric opening weekend and strong word-of-mouth buzz, The Lego Movie will most likely sit atop the box office once again. President’s Day weekend means that there will be more patrons in theaters, but don’t expect many of them to be there for new releases.

Well, here I am, a single girl on Valentine’s Day. Am I bothered by this fact? Not a bit. Being single is awesome when you’re in a relationship with your kitchen; your heart only becomes broken when you run out of your favorite extra virgin olive oil from Ravece Rotondela, Italy.
To be truthful, I haven’t always loved Valentine’s Day. In my tweens, I snidely referred to it as Single Awareness Day. Black — not any permutation of pink or red — was my color choice when dressing for the day. Thankfully, I’ve matured. These days, even though I’m still single, I embrace Feb. 14 with a vengeance. I give valentines to my friends, play passionate music, watch cheesy chick flicks and make a really good (some might call it romantic) dinner, like lamb-stuffed bell peppers with bacon-baked orzo and a nice glass of wine.
Valentine’s Day is finally upon us and, whether you’ve been dreading today or have some swanky plans for tonight, all must face the fact that love is in the air. That love doesn’t have to be turned toward a significant other; it can be used on anything that you care about, and for the sake of this column and in my case, that’s food.
To me, Valentine’s Day means so much more than being in a relationship; Valentine’s Day is specifically tailored to show your love.
Nothing says romance like chocolate on Valentine’s Day and it is usually the main course to any Valentine’s get-together. If you’re not going out this Valentine’s Day and want to spend some time at home with that special someone, here are some easy, delicious and chocolatey dinner ideas that you can cook together.
Appetizer – Lover’s Salad with Chocolate Vinaigrette, by Sandra Lee, Semi-Homemade
Your romantic evening at home should be light and flavorful. Salads, bread rolls and bite-sized dishes always are a great option and, because it is Valentine’s Day, infusing some chocolate into the mix is a fun and creative way to sweeten up the evening. This Lover’s Salad with chocolate vinaigrette is easy to make and affordable on a college budget. Enjoy with slices of a fresh French baguette with olive oil and vinegar.
Main Course – Mole Poblano Tacos, by Pati’s Mexican Table
Mole is a Mexican chocolate-based sauce that is eaten with chicken and is served on a warm tortilla as a taco or as a single plate with sides such as fried plantains, rice and beans. Mole is a savory dish that certainly should not be missed. And if you don’t have time to make the sauce from scratch, cans of the sauce are found in local grocery stores. Pati of Pati’s Mexican Table has a recipe for Mole Poblano, made with a poblano chile ground in a molcajete (Mexican stone grinder) and blended carefully into the dark chocolate.
Dessert – Chocolate Bacon Cupcakes with Maple Bacon Frosting, by The Novice Chef Blog
Ending dinner with a chocolatey dessert that also has bacon is a must. One simply cannot go wrong with that deadly combination – this dessert is definitely the cherry on top to your evening of sweet and savory chocolate bliss. The Novice Chef not only acknowledges the importance of bacon, but complements it with maple syrup, making for a mouthwatering chocolate-bacon experience. I do warn that you eat these with caution because they have a lot of potential to be very addicting and these are in no way good for your health, but hey, you need a day to splurge, right?
If you’re single, you better have something fabulous planned for yourself – ladies, a chick flick, some sweet champagne and strawberries are a nice way to spend your evening, even if it is a girls’ night in. If you’re in a relationship, I hope you planned accordingly, because Valentine’s Day has to be one of the busiest nights for restaurants in any major city.
