In a year so inescapably political, the films that closed out 2016 became the gust of fresh air the country needed. Startlingly sharp and notably innovative, the past year’s movies guided viewers through the deaths of beloved artists, the tumultuous circus of Donald Trump’s presidential transition and months and months of global violence. Compared to these real-life forces, movies can rightfully seem trivial and irrelevant. But as Americans move closer to a Trump presidency, the country is witnessing art take on its historical role as political protester. In 2017 and in the years to come, it is as important to enjoy the movies as it is to hold filmmakers accountable for recognizing and reshaping the societal contexts of their work.
A remarkable number of the films that emerged from 2016 were pulled from the fabric of real life: Jackie, Sully and Hacksaw Ridge are all based on real people; Moonlight, Manchester by the Sea and Hell or High Water attend to their portrayals of different American communities with painstaking, ingrained realism. As such, movies in the latter group deserve to be recognized as emblems of their times. 
And indeed, some of these emblems did what movies should always do: gather the social issues surrounding them and move the discussion forward. Some others, though astonishing pieces of art in and of themselves, stretched cinematic and aesthetic boundaries but failed to root themselves in the context necessary for progressive political discourse. 
Sure, movies are only movies. But when the Oscars roll in just a month after Trump’s inauguration, what will it mean if a movie about a white musician telling black musicians that only he knows true jazz (La La Land) wins Best Picture when a movie about a gay black man navigating love and trauma in Miami (Moonlight) does not? Does it mean that willful ignorance wins, again?
Not necessarily, and that would be an extreme view to take. But it is necessary to consider that movies play a role in how this country thinks about politics. Just recently, in the wake of “alt-right” white nationalists calling for a boycott on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story for its promotion of multiculturalism, it is more crucial than ever before to recognize that movies and politics share a common currency: identity.
And so continues the debate: defending and denigrating movies and pushing for and pulling away from on-screen diversity. Recently amid this dialogue, film scholar Mark Harris wrote a letter to Slate imploring audiences not to designate some movies (i.e. the indie breakout Moonlight) for “‘coastal elites’” and others (such as Hell or High Water) for “‘real America.’” This practice, he argues, would divide the country along the same lines plowed by the presidential election.
Harris has a fair point: Movies are supposed to unite people, not split them into factions. And in his appraisal of last year’s releases, he is correct that 2016 witnessed a number of surprisingly relevant films, including Hell or High Water for its depiction of the financially drained white working class and Moonlight for its exploration of black and queer themes. As a whole, Harris asserts that these movies reflect a sprawling America, even in its brokenness. 
Despite advances in diversity, working-class white male characters led a great number of last year’s movies, as they have from the dawn of cinema. And yet perhaps because in 2016 this same demographic elected Trump to the presidency, movies like Paterson, Hell or High Water and Manchester by the Sea are suddenly accruing praise for their honest and complex portrayal of white men. In his letter, Harris even acknowledges the “racist jokes” said by a white character in Hell or High Water, but justifies the offenses by arguing that they stemmed from the “economic anxiety of white men in danger of displacement.”
Sure, a film like Hell or High Water depicts a real part of America. But it is also a portrait audiences have encountered over and over again. When will critics stop praising movies for being honest and instead applaud them for being brave and new? The assertion that a movie like Hell or High Water is important because of its authentic portrayal of rural white men is just a mask that justifies another generation of racist jokes. 
For decades, films have been made about working-class white male farmers, cowboys, dreamers, fighters and underdogs — characters who, demographically and geographically, probably would have voted for Trump if they had lived in this election cycle. Nevertheless, as the last year proved, it is not Hollywood that needs to emphasize the complexities of working class white men. In 2016, members of this group demonstrated with their own votes how complicated they were and just how deeply liberal moviegoers had misidentified them.
Well-developed characters and storylines deserve recognition, but it is an entirely different animal to celebrate representation where representation has always been. It is high time for Hollywood to step back, look in the mirror and recognize itself for the powerful catalyst it is. Movies reflect change, but they also must create change, and it is no coincidence that the increasing number of releases of racially diverse, feminist films are also some of the most beautiful, critically-acclaimed works of the past decades. Recent releases such as Moonlight, Fences and Lion not only showcase the strength of minority and female characters, but these movies also advance both the society that birthed them and the medium in which they were presented. 
As always, change is good for society. But as we are beginning to learn, change is also immensely good for art.

I came to the startling realization earlier this week that my days as a student at this University are numbered. After I put on my graduation robe and walk across the stage to collect my diploma, I fear I will lose the security of the Trojan Family camaraderie, the feeling that we’re in this together. 
It’s the hugging between strangers after your football team makes a fourth-quarter comeback at the Rose Bowl. It’s the peaceful congregation at Tommy Trojan after an ugly presidential election, promising that despite the nation’s political divide, we as students will reach across and band together. It’s the somber gathering in remembrance of a leading expert in his field.
This pervasive unity is electric, and there’s no doubt that more and more hopeful Trojans want to be a part of our tribe. There were a record number of applicants for the Class of 2020, a feat sure to be shattered by the new class and a tribute to the strength of our academics. Entrepreneur Larry Ellison’s $200 million donation established the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine, launching us to the forefront of cancer research. Professor Viet Thanh Nguyen won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his revolutionary novel The Sympathizer, meanwhile enriching his students in the classroom. And that was just in 2016.
But Trojans, selected from a greater pool of excellence, enter a new era of USC greatness. The campaign for USC advanced by President C.L. Max Nikias is inches away from reaching its $6 billion target. The USC Village, a three-year-long, $700 million community construction effort, sees its ribbon cutting ceremony before the start of the new school year. An age of new beginnings dawns on the USC football team.
Here at the Daily Trojan, we will continue to capture our University’s ascent and invite you to be a part of the process. This semester, we hope to interact with our readership, establishing online forums for student commentary and asking for an increased number of guest submissions.
I also encourage you to look at our ever-evolving digital platforms, featuring dynamic forms of coverage. Your stories will not exist simply in black-and-white text, but will be supplemented with visuals and multimedia features. We will continue to adapt to the ever-burgeoning digital world, relaying reliable news to you as rapidly as possible.
All the while, our commitment to the quality of our content will be greater than ever. We will raise more questions on issues pertinent to the the student body. We will seek to report on the vast array of life experiences on this campus, highlighting what might not otherwise come to light.
We go to a great school. And the Daily Trojan will continue to celebrate this excellence with all of you by our side.

Bad news: Sexual assault is on the rise nationwide — but the outlook on campus doesn’t look much better. Despite increased efforts on campus, changes to the Student Code of Conduct and Title IX office and the creation of a Sexual Assault Task Force, the numbers continue to rise. Forty-one sexual offenses were reported to DPS in 2015, including 13 rape cases, which increased from 31 total and 18 rape cases in 2014. As of November 2016, USC Annenberg Media reported 34 sexual assaults last year using data from DPS and the LAPD. Since that date, 18 rapes were reported to LAPD in the university area, though it is unclear if any of them involved USC students. LAPD data on Southwest Los Angeles, which includes but is not limited to the USC area, also shows a 15 percent increase in reported rapes between 2015 and 2016. Though DPS likely won’t release their official crime statistics for several months — the full 2015 report was only released this past September — these early markers point to yet another year of increased sexual assault on campus and in the surrounding community.
According to the latest Campus Climate Survey, which collected data from 20 percent of the school population in the spring of 2015, 14.5 percent of undergraduate female students had experienced “nonconsensual penetration” in their college experience. Compared to 27 other top universities that participated in the same survey, USC was well above the average in the number of sexual assaults, tying the University of Michigan for the top spot. The school was also featured in The Hunting Ground, a 2015 documentary on the issue.
These trends only track reported sexual assaults, and are most likely rising, at least in part because of a culture where victims feel safer to report. High-profile cases at Stanford, Columbia and Baylor, combined with investigative reports like Jon Krakauer’s book Missoula and the now-disproved Rolling Stone cover story “A Rape On Campus,” have brought an unprecedented amount of attention to the issue and put pressure on universities to take action. In this sense, the rising numbers could be interpreted as a positive sign, more indicative of victims’ ability to safely come forward than a spike in the crime itself. In a strange twist of fate, the universities’ steps to deter sexual assault might have actually caused the numbers to rise by turning crimes that were once shameful secrets or “boys being boys” (though of course people of all genders can be victimized) into actionable offenses that victims feel justified to report.
But obviously, no one can take a rising number of sexual assaults as a pat on the back. Even one rape in the campus community is too many. Additionally, the most recent surveys show that only about 35 percent of rapes are reported to police. That means that for every rape that we see in these annual reports, there are potentially two more that are uncounted. And yes, the deeply personal, he-said-she-said nature of rape prosecution can result in some false reports that can skew data. In reality, though, few rape allegations are found to be false. All of these floating statistics and percentages add up to one conclusion: We have a problem, as a nation and a university.
The administration has taken admirable steps toward addressing the issue, and it seems to be honestly invested in the well-being of USC students when it comes to sexual assault. It should be recognized for the efforts made so far. But that doesn’t mean we can let the administration or anyone in the campus community off the hook when it comes to sexual assault.
Existing education programs such as the “Think About It” online training, open discussion of the issue at Freshman Orientation and USG’s weeklong awareness event “It Ends Here” are all good starts and indicative of a campus that is willing to have an open dialogue about the issue. But in the face of these rising statistics, something else must be done. Other universities have taken extreme measures like requiring registered bartenders at parties and only allowing co-ed fraternities, and hopefully USC can change this troubling trend before those actions are necessary. Besides, administrative action can only go so far in battling an issue that begins and ends with students. 
As a new semester begins, the campus community must make a concerted effort to end sexual assault wherever possible. That means intervening as a bystander, removing possible victims from dangerous situations and providing unwavering support for survivors. The reversal of this steady rise begins with accepting that we have a problem that will not go away by itself and that every student, faculty member and administrator has a personal responsibility to end it. Let’s make 2017 the year that finally decreases sexual assault incidents, and not another data point in a disturbing trend.

Despite decrying universities as echo chambers, President-elect Donald Trump has retreated to his own self-reinforcing machine: his Twitter account. Tweeting on a daily basis, in the midst of criticism coming from across the spectrum and the world, Trump can immerse himself in social media, where thousands of likes and retweets comfort him but only perpetuate confirmation bias. Indulging in his inflated popularity only deludes Trump and distracts him from harsh truths, such as the fact that only 37 percent of millennials voted for him. Despite sharing a common love of Twitter, millennials and Trump have sharp differences, not only in terms of priorities, but also in terms of policy positions. Perhaps the sole exception is the student debt crisis, which Trump has promised to tackle. His stance and action on student loans will determine whether or not Trump runs the risk of further alienating what will soon be the largest voting bloc in the country. Trump needs to take action on student debt in order to demonstrate to millennials that he has their interests in mind.
Though Trump received a million-dollar loan from his father decades ago, today, millions of students take out loans to put themselves through college — and accrue thousands of dollars in debt in the process. Collectively, this debt adds up to a whopping $1.3 trillion, preventing graduates from getting married or buying a house, which imposes a massive drag on the economy and social mobility. In a surprise move to many, including those in the Republican Party, Trump released his ambitious student debt plan this past October. 
Trump’s initial plan looks remarkably similar to President Barack Obama’s latest income-driven Revised Pay as You Earn plan, which limits borrower’s monthly payments to 10 percent of their income while forgiving remaining debt after 20 years of payment. Trump’s proposed legislation tweaks these figures by capping income payments at 12.5 percent and forgiving debt after 15 years.  This means that borrowers will be sacrificing more of their paycheck per month but do so for fewer months. Trump hopes that lower government spending, coupled with fewer students defaulting on loans, will cover the cost of this remarkably generous and ambitious plan; but forgiving debt after fewer years comes with a large price tag, especially considering that doctors and lawyers with six-figure debt will be the largest beneficiaries.
In addition to these economic hurdles, several questions linger. First, Trump needs to clarify whether these revised figures would apply only to income-based loans or for all federal loans. Second, Trump must clarify the role of the federal government in the loan process. Trump’s overarching economic goals rely on the private sector’s cooperation, but in 2017 less than 10 percent of new student debt will be from private sector sources.
Even if Trump can flesh out and improve his ideas, because of his own fickle policy positions and Republican fiscal conservatism, many millennials are still left in this election’s aftermath worrying about the future of their education and economic well-being.
Actions speak louder than words, and concern about the student debt crisis was absent not only during most of Trump’s campaign, but also in his 100 day plan. Moreover, though Trump’s Republican Party controls both the House and Senate, which would facilitate the passage of a potential bill, student loans have never been a priority for Republicans. Republicans have made it clear that their immediate agenda centers on scrapping Obamacare and various regulations while implementing their own fiscally conservative economic plan. While these factors potentially spell stagnation on the front of student debt, there might be hope that Democrats will partner with the President-elect to move student debt reform plans forward.
 If Trump truly considers himself the champion of American workers, then he should do everything he can to free the millions of workers struggling under mountains of debt and to help students looking to enter the workforce. This election wasn’t just about pitting liberals against conservatives or the heartland of America against the coasts — it was about whether the true needs of millennials would be heard over the clamor of tweets, culture wars and allegations. The millennials’ favorite for office may have lost the election, but if Trump answers their calls, then four years of waiting for relief and ultimate prosperity might not be lost.

Running is a lot like writing. For people who don’t do much of either, that first sentence has probably already sent them fast-walking to the exit. But I’d probably make it to the door faster, and I’d tell them to hear me out.
Running is already a part of your existence — every time you put a bounce in your step, every time you go after the ball and every time you rush down a flight of stairs because your Uber is about to leave. There is no threshold to call yourself a runner, no required number of 5Ks or no mandatory amount of joy you’re supposed to feel from lacing up a pair of sneakers. In fact, even after a marathon, a half-marathon and more 5Ks than I can count, I still dread it sometimes.
It’s the same sort of dread I get when I’m staring at a blank page. Writing is similarly integrated into daily life and yet so difficult to find motivation for. It’s so easy to send your friend a novel about what they missed last night. You already pride yourself in crafting perfectly worded emails for missing class and finding puns for your Instagram captions. You are a writer; it’s just that essays and stories and scripts are arduous and exhausting.
What I’ve found, though, is that grueling efforts are often the most rewarding. It’s why I haven’t been able to stop running or writing all of these years.
I started running on a total whim. When I was in fifth grade, my stepdad made a well-intentioned New Year’s resolution to get fit and start running. My mom signed him up for his first race, a little neighborhood five-mile Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving. When the day came, my stepdad was a nervous wreck. He was worried about being too slow or not being able to finish or getting horrendously injured mid-race. I think it was all the neon spandex leggings and slim-fitting athletic jackets that really got to him, though. My stepdad’s confidence was crumbling, and my mom was getting frustrated, so I piped up and asked if he would do it if I ran with him.
Now, let me put this in perspective. I was a short and stick-like 11-year-old. I had asthma that was bad enough to send me to the hospital. I figure-skated, but my program at the time was less than two minutes long. I had volunteered to run a five-mile race when I was wearing jeans and a sweater, and I hadn’t even run the mile that year in P.E. because my class had negotiated a deal with our new P.E. teacher.
My stepdad said he was game if I was. So we lined up with about 1,000 other crazy people on Thanksgiving morning and set off running. I lost him after the first mile. The thing that kept me going, though, was the running community. Experienced runners would offer encouragement and praise as they passed. Spectators cheered and held signs, and the houses along the race route blasted music from their speakers. I raced some other little kids for a block or two. It was like a big party.
Around mile four, the excitement started to wear off. I had the worst cramp in my side, and breathing in the cold air started to hurt. I walked for a little bit and had an inner fight with my stomach to keep my breakfast down. One lady with a dog saw me struggling and told me to run with her to the finish line. She wouldn’t let me give up. We were almost there. So I scraped up whatever energy I had left and followed her. By the time I crossed under the arch of balloons at the finish line, I had never been so happy. Runner’s high is a real thing, and I rode it for the rest of the day as I shoveled copious amounts of mashed potatoes into my mouth.
That incredible feeling is something I hope to share with people through this column. I’ll be writing about this sport and community that’s really more of a lifestyle in the hopes that you’ll get out there and try it for yourself. You just have to approach it the same way you approach writing: Just do it.

English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran released two new singles this past Friday, signaling the end of a three-year hiatus since the release of his second album x. The singles are currently building anticipation for his upcoming album ÷ (pronounced “divide”). “Shape of You” and “Castle on the Hill” are the first two singles for the 2017 album from the “Thinking Out Loud” singer-songwriter. Since topping the iTunes charts and breaking Spotify’s one-day streaming record, Sheeran’s highly anticipated releases mark the beginning of a new era in the singer’s career. 
“Shape of You” is a song about a budding romance. Sheeran cleverly utilizes marimba sounds in the song to create a tropical house sound, a pop subgenre that has recently grown in popularity among artists such as Justin Bieber and Sia. “Shape of You” resembles Sheeran’s 2014 single “Sing” in structure and flow, but is smoother in tone. 
A likely charting single, Sheeran harnesses his songwriting talent with catchy lyrics. “I’m in love with the shape of you / We push and pull like a magnet do,” he sings in the chorus. While the song does not fully showcase Sheeran’s songwriting talent, it isn’t unlike “Sing” among other songs that prelude to an album release, in which the upbeat pop loops complement and contrast his variety of works.
 On the other hand, “Castle on the Hill” is an ode to Sheeran’s native county of Suffolk and is lyrically nostalgic as he illustrates his youth and adolescence in the place he describes as home. Sheeran references milestones in his life that occurred over the locations in the Suffolk setting that the title references, and while times have changed and he and friends have grown, he “can’t wait to go home.”
 The song’s production style is influenced by both a stadium-rock sound and U2, with some pop undertones that might make a listener hear some resemblance to “Summer of ‘69” by Bryan Adams. With Benny Blanco — who is coming off recent successful collaborations with The Weeknd, Major Lazer and Tory Lanez — credited as producer, the song is sure to be another hit.
 Although Sheeran has not announced an official release date for ÷, Sheeran has been much more active since the time of his last album’s release. For almost a year, the “Thinking Out Loud” singer halted activity on social media. In December, the star hinted at the prospect of new music by posting several photos and videos of the album’s theme. Sheeran also appeared on BBC Radio 1 and discussed potential live appearances, which could include the United Kingdom’s Glastonbury Festival.
 Sheeran’s upcoming album is likely to build upon the styles he is known for in his previous albums and showcase his songwriting talent, as well as experiment with the countless artists he has been able to collaborate with since achieving mainstream success. He lists influences such as Damien Rice, The Beatles and Bob Dylan, whose sounds are evident in much of his rock and folk-influenced work.
This next album, ÷, is expected to be Sheeran’s most spotlighted release yet, and these influences should culminate in another authentic and ingenious work from the acclaimed singer-songwriter.

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
It is a confidently stated slogan, followed by a sly wink emoticon comprised of a semicolon and a parenthetical. 
“Tommy knows best,” the slogan says, foreshadowing the omnisciently reliant innovation that is Tommy Bot, an online chatbot Trojans can depend on every minute of their day. 
A 24-hour accessible innovation that replies within seconds of receiving a message, Tommy Bot has a rapid answering mechanism disguised behind a simple golden silhouette of USC’s figurehead: Tommy Trojan. Tommy Bot will be the University’s first campus chatbot, operating through Facebook Messenger to serve as a knowledgeable virtual assistant.
The creators of Tommy Bot originally envisioned this chatbot as a tool that could easily answer basic questions about the University, such as the hours of its dining halls, libraries or buildings. These primary functions have evolved over the past few months; Tommy Bot has progressed into a rapidly expanding project with community-driven roots. And for its creators, it contains the potential to develop into something much greater. 
The journey behind Tommy Bot began in September within one of USC’s established entrepreneurial student organizations, LavaLab. Proclaiming itself as USC’s “project incubator,” the organization promotes and provides resources for designers, developers and entrepreneurs by encouraging student-run projects.
 The four creators of Tommy Bot — Sam Breck, Justin He, Will Durkee and Mimi Tran Zambetti — teamed up through the program and were assigned a set of ideas to guide their progress. 
The goal was to create a product for LavaLab’s Demo Night, an event last November in which various teams pitched their product ideas to industry professionals. 
“We were initially placed into industries, or categories, that would help guide the project,” He, one of the coders of the bot, said. 
The creators were confronted with a diverse range of topics to choose from. They could create a product that catered to campus issues or one marketed to a global audience. 
Breck, He and Durkee are coders and computer science majors, while Tran Zambetti’s background is more design-focused. After much thought, the students settled on the origins of Tommy Bot, and the team sought to produce an interactive, user-friendly innovation for the campus body. 
While creating — and essentially coding — Tommy Bot, the four divvied up the tasks, with the coders working on their individual segments and Tran Zambetti focusing more on design and marketing the product. 
The team realized that online access to university-related information was inefficient, requiring students to browse a number of USC-affiliated websites to find the information they needed. They aimed to create and market an application that is direct — a single-handed resource that contains a bulk of information about the campus. 
“As we developed this bot to help our fellow students, we tried to get as much feedback as possible,” Breck said. “Through this process, we managed to create a new method of interacting with USC-related information.”
Originally, the creators’ vision of Tommy Bot was very limited in scope, similar to a basic directory that compiled the hours and locations of USC’s campus. However, as the bot is garnering more attention and student use, the team is continually adding features to the application’s code. 
“In beta mode, we had about 200 users, and at the bot’s peak, we answered about 500 queries per day,” He said, in response to Tommy Bot’s usage statistics. 
Over winter break, the developers fine-tuned the bot by debugging it and creating unique features, such as adding the ability to book a room in Leavey Library, implementing campus calendar events and answering detailed questions about dining hall menus. 
Currently, its code is open-sourced, meaning that any member of the public can contribute or suggest features that may help the coders innovate. Regardless, new features are constantly being made to refine the application, and the creators hope that the open-sourced code fosters a sense of community within the product, which is unique to USC.
In the coming week, Tommy Bot’s creators are preparing to officially launch at the start of the spring semester, with the intent of marketing the bot toward spring admits who are new to campus.
“It was extremely gratifying to see friends and other students start to solve some of their day-to-day problems through Tommy,” Durkee said. 
Yet, the team still has greater things in mind for Tommy Bot outside of the campus community.
“We hope to expand the product’s chatbot concept to other universities, especially those with large campuses, and engage in events that will reach out to local coding communities,” He said.
Tommy Bot can be accessed through Facebook, and for more information and updates, visit www.tommybot.com or follow Tommy on Instagram @tommy.bot.

With the first seasons of both Stranger Things and The Crown nominated for the Golden Globes, Netflix continues to rise as a Hollywood player in the distribution and creation of original film and television. Though not quite as expansive in production as the venerable HBO, Netflix’s best days still unquestionably lie ahead.
Its two Golden Globe-nominated original series — which, combined, were nominated in three different categories — span in content from 1980s science fiction nostalgia to World War II-era England. This feat showcases Netflix’s commitment to the ever-changing boundaries of format and content, while retaining its title as the iconic streaming service that changed the way the world watches television.
With an impressive range of original content currently including Black Mirror, Arrested Development and Sense8, Netflix continues to promise.

A Series of Unfortunate Events – Jan. 13
Lemony Snicket’s beloved classics are finally coming to life in one of the winter’s most-anticipated releases. Though a 2004 movie starring Jim Carrey was also based on the popular children’s novels, this is the story’s first on-screen retelling in long-form — as the title would have it, as an actual series. Starring veteran actor Neil Patrick Harris, practically unrecognizable in his foreboding make-up as Count Olaf, A Series of Unfortunate Events promises to be a darkly funny visual spectacle.

One Day at a Time – Jan. 6
The original One Day at a Time was a Golden Globe-winning sitcom that ran from the late ’70s through the early ’80s. Starring a classic American (read: white) family, the series depicted its characters using hilarity and optimism to start a new life after a mother’s divorce. Netflix’s new iteration of the sitcom asks us to consider another kind of American family: also single-parent, but this one Cuban American. Starring Isabella Gomez and Rita Moreno, One Day at a Time maintains its humor while centering itself on issues pertaining to veterans, families defined by a blend of cultures and other groups whose voices are rarely portrayed in television.

Frontier – Jan. 20
Though it has been playing in Canada since last November, Frontier is breaking new ground for being Discovery’s first scripted TV series. From a channel whose shows have always taken viewers on journeys, Frontier delves into the brutal and bloody late-1700s fur trade. Featuring Landon Liboiron and the recognizable Jason Momoa of Game of Thrones, the new series will be a fascinating and dramatic take on colonial American history.

Dear White People – TBA
Netflix evidently likes making series out of movies that worked, and who can forget director Justin Simien’s scathing, sharp and honest 2014 film of the same name? The series, like the film, depicts a small community of black students who attend an Ivy League university discovering and fighting through casual racism. At their mostly white school, racist behavior ranges from subtle and insidious to obvious and horrifying. Through this, Dear White People seeks to paint a larger picture of what systemic injustices minority college students face in real life. Starring Brandon P. Bell from the film and directed by Simien and Moonlight’s Barry Jenkins, Dear White People promises to spark as many conversations as its movie counterpart.

13 Reasons Why – TBA
College-age students may recognize this series based on the popular young adult novel of the same name by Jay Asher. After teenager Hannah commits suicide, her admirer Clay is driven to know why. But it seems that Hannah wants to tell her story too, leaving behind audio tapes that wind up in Clay’s hands. 13 Reasons Why is a twisting, dark mystery, and it will be telling to see how the series handles the very real issue of teenage suicide. The upcoming series stars Christian Navarro (of Vinyl and The Tick) and features Selena Gomez as executive producer.

Bill Nye Saves the World – TBA
It is both poetic and frightening that beloved scientist Bill Nye’s new series debuts in a year when the world so desperately needs saving — not just politically, but also environmentally. With the help of five correspondents, including model Karlie Kloss and comedian Joanna Hausmann, Bill Nye will spend each episode discussing the ties between science and American society, as well as debunking false statements from corporate and political leaders. Especially striking in an era when climate change — of all things — has been deadlocked in a political battle, Nye will use knowledge and facts to arm political activists and spread truth to younger generations.
