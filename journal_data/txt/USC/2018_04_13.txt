Last weekend, students from the Environmental Core group rallied together to implore USC to take greater steps to promote environmentalism and sustainable practices on campus. With climate change positioned as one of the central issues that world powers will have to grapple within the coming years, students have good reason to be concerned, and their actions to keep this issue on the University’s radar are necessary and important.
USC, like many peer institutions, has a sustainability plan with goals and commitments to different sustainability initiatives. The project, titled Sustainability 2020, includes efforts by the University such as to achieve 75 percent waste diversion levels by the year 2020, and reduce 2014 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent. However, many of the objectives are written in vague terms with few details or tangible courses of action to achieve them. Perhaps the University has prepared a detailed plan on how to achieve its goals, but we as students would not be able to tell from what is public. 
In fact, following the rally, USC’s Executive Director of Administrative Operations Mark Ewalt said that much of what the students at the rally were asking for is already included in the Sustainability 2020 plans. But this response fails to acknowledge the nuances in what students are specifically demanding. Students at the rally were requesting that University President C. L. Max Nikias sign the Second Nature Presidents’ Climate Commitment, which has been signed by approximately 600 university presidents. 
To Ewalt and USC’s credit, many of the goals are similar — to cut down on carbon emissions and educate the student body about ways to lead sustainable lives — but the timeline and benchmarks are quite different. Whereas USC’s plan lays out a goal of what it hopes to achieve by 2020, and subsequently, by 2030, the Second Nature commitment lays out a specific timeline for achieving each of the goals. For example, the commitment allows two months to create internal structures to accommodate the development of these changes, a year to begin implementation of changes, two years to monitor these changes and three years to achieve completion. It also specifies re-submitting plans every five years, instead of the University’s current trend of every 10 years. 
This is a more transparent and structured approach to sustainability, and one the University should seriously consider. With regard to an issue as nuanced and complex as climate change, universities are situated in a unique position. They are not only institutions attempting to improve their environmental policies and reduce their carbon footprints, but they are also places of higher learning. And so, just as they are responsible for implementing their own institutional goals, they are equally responsible for educating student bodies on ways they can contribute to a more sustainable planet. 
USC and universities across the country must prioritize their role in cultivating the next generation to be educated about and prepared to lead environmentally responsible lives. Today’s students did not create climate change, but they are the ones who will inherit its consequences. Universities, then, have a responsibility to implement a structured, tangible and transparent commitment to equip students with the tools to do this.
Along with this commitment to greater transparency regarding sustainability, USC should be encouraging its students to engage in sustainable practices and providing them with the resources to do so. 
Schools like Harvard and Stanford have sections on their websites indicating various ways students can get involved in the school’s sustainability pledge, as well as guides to how they can promote sustainability on campus. 
While USC recognizes the importance of educating its students about environmental issues on its website, it does not provide students with specific opportunities to contribute. Top-down institutional pledges to sustainability are important, but rallies like the one last week demonstrate that students want to get involved. 
The impetus is now on the University to empower students to take part in the conversation. Students and administrators are on the same side of this issue, and it’s important they are allowed to fight alongside each other. 
The first step to achieving this is to provide a more transparent system of laying out the sustainability goals so USC students can stay informed about the University’s progress. Yearly updates are not nearly enough. The next step would be to outline specific ways students can contribute to these goals on campus, whether through changes to their daily routines, volunteer and research opportunities or campus organizations and outreach programs.
The ECore rally was a significant step forward in the fight for sustainability on campus, but students should not have to follow Nikias around USC Village to have their voices heard. The University should harness these student voices and proclivities for environmental activism into aiding in its efforts.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan announced on Wednesday that he would not be seeking reelection, leaving the Republican Party even more concretely in the hands of President Donald Trump. When he assumed the office in 2015, Ryan had ideas; he had visions; he had notions of a Grand Old Party very different from the one we observe today. Nevertheless, he also had three children, whom he claims he is retiring from politics to spend more time with. According to his predecessor, a certain Newt Gingrich, “He’s tired.” 
Ryan was everything Republicans always wanted to think of themselves as: measured, moral, masculine, a master of policy, family-oriented. The man who was formerly described as the “intellectual center” of the Republican Party has bowed out to a smattering of applause, from those cognizant of what could have been. 
Ryan once dreamed of a simplification of the tax code, a smaller social safety net and an inclusive Republican Party. And yet, Medicare and social security are intact; his tenure leaves behind a deficit scheduled to surpass $1 trillion by 2020, in the best of economic circumstances; and the tax overhaul he celebrated this week makes for a lackluster swan song, especially considering what he really wanted — tax code simplification — was lost in the sea of final negotiations. 
He stood behind a president who lionized white nationalists in Charlottesville last summer and characterized majority-nonwhite allies as “sh-thole countries.” Conflicts of interest abound; scandals that run contrary to Evangelical family values pop up faster than even “The failing New York Times” can handle. Ryan watched his president tear the Trans-Pacific Partnership apart and demand a laundry list of new tariffs; the longtime supporter of nonpartisan law enforcement institutions watched Trump denounce and excoriate the FBI and Justice Department. These were not the Republican emblems or messages of which a wide-eyed Ryan dreamed. 
One of my favorite devices in modern literature is the story of defective resurrection: Tragic hero uses unconventional method to bring lover back from dead; lover comes back wrong, different — tragic hero realizes lover can never truly be with them again. 
The story of Ryan and his conference is much the same — to his credit, he inherited a fracturing, radicalizing mess of factions from his predecessor John Boehner, a party on the brink of a debt crisis having just cannibalized its own Speaker and precipitated a government shutdown. But the cost of that resurrection was the final death of the party’s moral character.
It is hard to imagine George H. W . Bush’s Republicans standing behind a president who behaves like Trump. The sort of opportunism that allowed many in his conference to un-endorse and then re-endorse presidential candidate Trump is the same opportunism that ignores the mass murder of children from gun violence and supports accused sexual predators for Senate. I don’t chalk all this up to Ryan. But he did not have what it took to use his youth or intellectual capital to make himself or his office the much-needed conservative bulwark against Trumpism. 
Instead, he chooses to jump ship. Is drowning with honor really superior to crashing and burning with the crew? 
As for the rest of the party, Ryan’s departure signals something more gravely concerning. Environmentalists often make reference to the “keystone species” of any given environment; inextricably dependent on key ecological factors, this species’ disappearance signals an unsustainable level of toxicity in the ecosystem. 
Ryan is the keystone species of intellectual conservatism; he was the man with a plan greater than reliance on adjoined greed or the enduring bonds of wealth or whiteness. He held onto the last vestiges of traditional American conservatism — low taxes, free-market economics, individual liberty, social traditionalism. His disappearance speaks to the death of a party of Reaganomics and the rise of a party of Trumpian ethno-nationalism. 
Nevertheless, it’s more good news for the Congressional Democrats, and those of us who would actually like to see the protection and freedom of all Americans. It’s another slew of bad news for the Republicans, making it that much harder to campaign in the midterms; it’s another opportunity for the Democrats to turn things around to better reflect their own party and goals.
Ryan claims he will not be running for anything in the foreseeable future (Stop! Stop laughing!) and we’ll see if that’s true. Policy mastermind and conservative whiz kid or not, Ryan was no friend to average Americans and no hero to the millions of people who depended on programs he tried so hard to sabotage. To be a truly insufferable millennial and quote synth-pop sensation Garrett Borns: “Bye-bye, darling!”

Six thousand miles away from campus, USC was a dream school for Da Zhong Wang, a high school senior at the Western Academy of Beijing. And when he found USC’s Facebook meme group, “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens,” last May, he knew he wanted to apply.
Nationwide, with the popularization of memes, groups like these have come to represent an integral part of campus culture, and prospective students like Wang utilize them to gain insight into schools during the college application process.
This year, USC’s acceptance rate dropped three percentage points, elevating its status among other elite institutions, and creating the potential to improve its national ranking. Wang was among those rejected, but instead of grieving over the decision, he decided to post a meme in the form of an email to USC Admissions.
“Thank you for your interest in giving me a rejection letter,” Wang’s meme said. “I have reviewed your letter and I am impressed with your rejection reasons and other suggestions. However, I have received many rejection letters this year. Under careful consideration I decided not to accept your rejection letter.”
Wang was bummed. But he wasn’t going to let that rejection get to him.
“I just thought I might write something funny … it was nothing hostile towards the admission committee,” Wang said.
And the Admissions Office noticed the post after it garnered over 2,400 likes. Director of Admission Kirk Brennan left an ambiguous comment on Wang’s post: “It might just work.”
The group, now filled with over 30,000 members started when Megan Andersen, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering, and Elise Vondra, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering, thought it might be a good idea to have a USC-specific meme group. The page was inspired by UC Berkeley’s, “UC Berkeley Memes for Edgy Teens,” and has grown far more rapidly than its creators anticipated. 
In fact, USC’s page was one of the first-ever college meme groups, among several other West Coast schools.
Within the past year, campus meme culture has catapulted into the mainstream. In June, a group of incoming Harvard freshmen were revoked admission to the university for creating a private Harvard memes group chat that featured insensitive memes mocking topics like  sexual assault, pedophilia and the Holocaust, according to The Harvard Crimson. But at USC, Andersen regards the page’s popularity as a result of students’ willingness to partake in self-deprecating humor and satire as a form of stress relief, reassurance and solidarity. 
“As we see with all college meme groups that have rose to prominence, it’s a great way to get out your frustrations and stress from your classes and just college life in general,” Andersen said. “I think that’s sort of where the meme page is great because it can bring together people from different areas in USC.”
Memes, a term originally coined in reference to cultural units that are imitated among the population, are transformed or duplicated to include different narratives as they are shared. An academic study on memes from the University of Arkansas found that memes represent participation in digital culture, similar to a form of social discourse.
At USC, the group poses an opportunity for students to spread social commentary about the school through sharp-tongued humor, from poking fun at different programs of study to complaining about USC’s Wi-Fi networks. While some memes are made for comedic effect, others are satirical criticisms of the University. In fact, some of the most popular memes have focused on tuition increases, gentrification of the local community and the Greek system.
“I think [the meme page] is the most relevant forum on campus … If anything goes on, I think that’s almost the news source that people check,” said John Lynch, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting. Lynch is an administrator of the group alongside Andersen and Vondra. “If anything happens, people are automatically making jokes about it or if there’s any issues people are going there.”
Last year, Lynch posted a meme pointing out Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority’s lack of diversity. The post racked up 2.6K likes ­— and even some backlash. According to Andersen, stereotypes about USC glorify Trojan Greek life, and Lynch’s meme could have disrupted prospective students’ beliefs about fraternities and sororities at USC.
Andersen recalls her own college selection process and noted how touring campuses or browsing online forums like College Confidential did not allow her to get a comprehensive look at prospective schools. However, she hopes the meme page can be a helpful and honest resource for interested students.
“It gives USC a lot more, as a school, human qualities,” Andersen said. “A campus tour is like —  here’s what I’m told to present by the admission office so it looks as good as possible, whereas with the meme page we’re not affiliated with USC at all. We’re from USC, but [the school] doesn’t tell us what to post or promote. It’s very genuinely from the students and what they’re feeling.”
Students like Wang, who have grown up immersed in internet culture, appear more attracted to schools that have a prominent online presence like a meme page. Wang said the meme page gave him access to detailed inside information about the school.
“I realized [the meme page] was really helpful because … the memes they shared are very University specific, so it actually gave me a lot of insight that I wouldn’t find anywhere else,” he said. “They kind of give off the vibe of each school, each major, how they’re like, even down to the specific professors and individuals in the school … There are universities out there with basically zero humor, and it’s nice to see that there’s an atmosphere at [USC].”
Cody Bishop, a high school senior at La Costa Canyon High School in Carlsbad, Calif., applied to USC and, like Wang, posted a meme after he was rejected. Bishop said he appreciated the support and positive comments on his meme.
“It felt pretty nice,” Bishop said. “[On] the USC meme page, they kind of just connected with you … [People] said don’t give up — you’ll probably make it one day if you really try hard enough.”
And perhaps students like Bishop and Wang won’t stay on the page, but Andersen said she wants students —accepted or not — to enjoy the humor of the Facebook group.
“I feel awful that all these people on the meme page who are so excited about USC didn’t get in,” Andersen said. “I hope that they realize they’re still welcome on the meme page no matter what … I hope that the meme page can stay a positive and good thing for USC campus like I think it is right now.”

In a time of political uncertainty for undocumented individuals, students from the Improving Dreams, Education and Academic Success organization have launched a Pop-Up DREAM Center for undocumented students. The center was additionally supported by the Department of American Studies and Ethnicity.
The Improving Dreams, Education and Academic Success organization at USC has launched a pop-up DREAM center that will be hosted in Kaprielian Hall every Tuesday and Thursday this month. Photo from Dornsife Website.
The center is open every Tuesday and Thursday in April from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and seeks to connect undocumented students, staff, faculty and allies to resources across campus. Throughout the remainder of the month, events have been coordinated in the center, including a workshop with the Career Center and a Drop-In Immigration Clinic. 
Associate Dean of Religious Life Vanessa Gomez Brake has worked closely with IDEAS to coordinate events for students affected by DACA. Since the beginning of the academic year, she has helped students launch the Pop-Up Dream Center. 
“In some ways this is a soft launch … but the hope is that for these next three weeks we will be offering different workshops and resources there at the Dream Center,” Gomez Brake said. “But in the fall, we are going to move up to more than just two days a week and have a ton of University staff that will be holding office hours at the Dream Center.“
 The Pop-Up Dream Center is also a centralized location which will reduce the needs of undocumented students to look far across campus for resources. According to Gomez Brake, the physical location will also serve as a safe space to facilitate conversation with mentors and peers about life on campus as an undocumented student. 
Valeria Resendiz, a sophomore majoring in NGOs and Social Change, emphasized that the center aims to create a supportive community for students to succeed in a time where the future of DACA is unknown. 
“This is a time with so much uncertainty, it can really just be overwhelming and sometimes frustrating to know where the future is taking us,” Resendiz said. “In such a situation that we don’t have much control over which other people are deciding for us.” 
Currently, the center is a space for undocumented students to converge, but in the future, Resendiz hopes to see a more permanent space accessible to all students.

At the USC Farmers Market on Wednesday, the Buck Truck pulled up and parked on McCarthy Quad for the first time. The Buck Truck is a pop-up food truck run by a group of students in a business entrepreneur class titled “Gaming the System.” Sophomores Arthur Johnston and Anthony Yin and junior Jacob Fishman created the Buck Truck — a healthy food truck that brings both Asian and Mediterranean influences to on-the-go food.
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
“We were initially just asked to create a conceptual business plan for a proposed food truck that we would pitch to industry professionals for feedback, and the team with the strongest concept would win a handful of coins,” Fishman said. 
But the pitch became a reality when their team was selected to partner with Roaming Hunger, the company that owns the truck and permits and staffs the kitchen.
The Buck Truck is a white truck painted with abstract black and pink lines and stamped with the boxy, clean-cut “Buck Truck” logo. It’s a classic raised-window food truck, with room onboard for about four to eight people. As lunchtime approached, a line began to form in anticipation of this new vendor among the Farmers Market’s usual offerings. 
Through advertising over Facebook, the Buck Truck was able to gain a following; some students came to the Farmers Market for the first time just to check out the truck. In another clever marketing ploy, customers could take pictures of themselves with the food or truck using a Polaroid camera. They then clipped the photos to lengths of string hanging on the side of the truck, unless they wanted to keep the photo, in which case they had to post something about the truck to their social media accounts. Though the photos were a tad washed out from the midday sun, they added to the truck’s overall aesthetic appeal.
The Buck Truck also gave out free lemonade to the first 200 customers until it ran out. The pink lemonade was freshly made and more sour than sweet, but it paired well with the various food items. The only appetizer/side menu item was the avocado fries, which consisted of quarters of thickly sliced avocado and deep-fried potatoes. The avocados were fresh enough that they held up against the oil they were fried in and did not become too greasy. However, eating that much avocado in one serving can weigh down one’s stomach, despite the contrast of the fried breadcrumb surface.
The Buck Truck served simple menu options — bowl or burrito, Tziki or Yaki. Tziki refers to the Mediterranean-inspired grilled lemon chicken with arugula and other veggies, avocado and tzatziki sauce. The Yaki bowls and burritos offered grilled teriyaki chicken over white rice and veggies, topped with chopped green onions, sliced avocado and sriracha mayonnaise. The flavors were not overtly Asian or Mediterranean, but the overall flavors paired well together. One burrito or bowl was $10 a la carte, but $13 with the addition of avocado fries and lemonade.
Johnston, Yin and Fishman partnered with Swipe Out Hunger, a nonprofit geared toward ending student hunger, for this event. Proceeds will go toward helping people in the USC community who struggle with food security. Despite being on the pricier side, the Buck Truck helped support a worthy cause and added a new and fresh flavor to the USC Farmers Market.

Temperatures start to heat up outside. Teachers remind you of final exams. Refrains of, “I can’t believe we only have X more weeks!” echo on campus. Clubs are hosting their final banquets and events. Thoughts and conversations about “next year” trickle in slowly. Ever since grade school, the anticipation of summer — so close that you can practically taste it — has felt familiar. Even when I was younger and really enjoyed school, the freedom of summer felt euphoric. Otter pops, summer camps and warm nights with the windows open called my name. 
My excitement for summer probably hit an all-time high in high school, and significantly dropped last year. I didn’t particularly want my freshman year to end. However, last summer ended up being one of the best I can remember. Most of my friends from high school were home and we frequented the same places we had frequented in high school, talking about what had changed in the last year and revelling in what hadn’t. It was a perfect representation of where I was: a freshman still figuring things out, not yet ready to be fully released into the world. I was doing two internships at home and exploring new opportunities and experiences. I was working in a professional environment, but at the end of the day, I could return to a nice home-cooked meal from my mom. I got to consider all the things that changed over the course of my first year of college — ambitions, activities, friends — while exploring my hometown in unexpected ways. 
Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
Last summer was likely the last time that all of my friends would be home together. We recognized that fact and cherished the time we had together. This summer, it’s time for something new. I’ll be moving to an entirely new city, trying new things and living on my own. Most people would say, “What’s the big deal? You do it already nine months of the year.” Most of the time, I agree that  summer away from home is just an extension of college. But other times, something about the sanctity of summer and the innocence that accompanies it makes this bittersweet. I only have two more summers until summer is nothing more than a seasonal change, no longer a time of exploration, freedom and reflection that it has come to mean for me. 
Of course, at least for the last several years, summer has been tied to some of the academic responsibilities of the school year including working and test preparation. But in reality, summer is not about an actual lack of work, it’s about the illusion of less work and the opportunity to learn in different ways. It’s about stepping outside of a classroom, taking more risks and taking the time to think about what the next year may bring. For many of us, after college, our lives will no longer be defined by academic years, but rather, fiscal quarters. We won’t get a break from reality for three months or be offered a defined set of time dedicated to expanding our horizons in whatever way we might choose. 
I’ve resolved that I’m going to try and make my next few summers something worth remembering. I’m going to set goals that are harder to accomplish during the school year. I’m going to try things that I wouldn’t usually try. I’m going to embrace the change that this summer is inevitably going to bring and try and find my path and what I ultimately want to do. There are only a few more years where I can use this socially constructed period of time that is summer vacation to break away from reality.

The USC football team held its second to last football practice of the spring on Thursday. Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast put the defense through a variety of drills as the offense battled the hard winds.

Injuries
Senior tight end Tyler Petite, who suffered a hamstring injury last Saturday, was held out once again. He will not participate in Saturday’s finale.
Sophomore offensive lineman Andrew Vorhees has a slight tear of his meniscus. He underwent surgery and is expected to be out for three to four weeks. Head coach Clay Helton expects him back for summer workouts.
Quarterbacks 
It was a long day for the USC quarterbacks. In their penultimate practice, redshirt sophomore Matt Fink and redshirt freshman Jack Sears battled the wind and a tough defense. 
The duo rarely attempted to throw downfield and instead relied on short passes during live drills. Still, they were not without fault. 
During the live portion of practice, Sears was picked off by redshirt senior cornerback Ajene Harris. The pick was thrown in the end zone as Sears tried to hit redshirt sophomore wide receiver Velus Jones. 
“Really great play by Ajene on the interception, coming off his man and making a pick,” Helton said after practice. 
Although Helton was quick to commend Harris, he later defended Sears’ read and chalked it up to his youth. 
“I thought he made a good read,” Helton said. “He floated it and allowed Ajene to come off and make that play. Just a young buck mistake.” 
Fink also turned the ball over, fumbling a snap during his set of drills.
Standouts
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Velus Jones continued to make his presence known during Thursday’s practice. He caught a midfield pass early on in between double coverage. 
In Petite’s absence, sophomore tight end Josh Falo became a favorite target among the quarterback duo. Falo, who is two inches taller than Petite, used his height on short throws to beat out smaller defensive backs. 
As sophomore tailback Stephen Carr recovers from back surgery, senior Aca’Cedric Ware has performed well in the competition to replace Ronald Jones II showing his burst and strength.
Defense
Once again, the defense made the day difficult for the offensive corps. The group caused a number of turnovers in addition to breaking up plays and causing disruptions on the line.
Pendergast emphasized the turnaround from Saturday’s practice. 
“We had done some things pressure-wise that cost a couple runs that we don’t normally let out,” Pendergast said. “But it was good for us to learn from.” 
The cornerbacks were at the forefront of the defensive surge. In addition to Harris’ end-zone pick, senior Iman Marshall had an impressive strip earlier in practice, adding to the number of turnovers on the day.
Helton noted the coaching of defensive backs coach Ronnie Bradford this spring. 
“One of the neat things we’ve been working really hard on is reading the eyes of a receiver,” Helton said. 
Other Notes
The team will not have a traditional spring football game to close out camp. Due to renovations at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the team will hold a normal practice at Cromwell Track and Field Saturday. 
The event will be open to the public and broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

Coming off two strong games to win a road series against Arizona State, the USC baseball team heads into this weekend’s series against Arizona hoping to build on a small sample size of success.

The lineup, which had been a major weakness for most of the season, led USC in their two wins, both of which included 14 hits and at least 8 runs scored. Head coach Dan Hubbs and his staff hope the team’s bats stay hot as the Trojans continue their season. 
Arizona is a strong, well-rounded team. Their 20-11 record doesn’t convey the Wildcats’ ability, as they sit in the top five of the Pac-12 in nearly every statistical category. Aside from a recent series victory over ninth-ranked Oregon State, they have issues against top competition, with a 4-5 record in conference and a 1-4 mark against other Power 5 schools.
This Wildcats team is dangerous at the plate. They rank third in the Pac-12 with a .295 team batting average, third with a .419 slugging percentage and first with a .406 on base percentage. 
They bat over seven runs per game, but have done so with just 16 home runs and 18 stolen bases on 31 attempts. They rank among the top teams in the conference in doubles and triples, but mainly, the Wildcats are simply smart at the plate. Arizona ranks second in sacrifice flies (18) and sacrifice bunts (29), first in walks (150) and have the fourth fewest strikeouts (186).
The Wildcats have the luxury of a deep lineup around star hitters. Five of their consistent starters have a batting average of .333 or higher, three of which have more than 30 RBIs. Perhaps their best hitter is sophomore second baseman Cameron Cannon, who is hitting .355 with a .562 slugging percentage. Cannon leads the Wildcats with 34 RBIs and is second in home runs (4) and extra base hits (15). Cannon is a tough out who won’t beat himself at bat, as evidenced by his 18 walks and .448 on-base percentage. 
Another of Arizona’s star hitters is sophomore third baseman Nick Quintana. Quintana is the Wildcats’ most powerful bat, leading the team in home runs (7) and extra base hits (17). However, he still hits a high average at .333 and has a strong on-base percentage of .421. Quintana’s biggest problem is strikeouts; he has 23 of them, the most on the team.
Arizona’s pitching is also intimidating; they boast the sixth best-earned run average in the entire NCAA at 2.73. They also allow the 24th fewest hits per nine innings with 7.52. They don’t strike many hitters out, but they don’t walk them, either. They simply don’t allow many baserunners.
The pitching staff has three consistent starters, the best of which is junior Cody Deason. Deason posts an incredible 2.00 ERA and allows hitters to bat just .187. He’s also thrown 45 strikeouts and has given up 0 home runs in 45 innings pitched.
The Wildcats also get good production from their bullpen. Senior closer Tylor Megill is the key contributor in late innings, as he’s amassed five saves and four wins on the strength of his sterling 1.45 ERA. Megill, who allows just a .175 batting average, is doubly intimidating because of his 6-foot-6 frame. Expect to see him towering on the mound at Dedeaux this weekend.
Arizona is also a fine team in the field. Their .976 fielding percentage is tied for fifth in the conference and 45th in the country. Three of their four leaders in errors play in the infield; junior first baseman Alfonso Rivas and Quintana have five, and Cannon has four. Making solid contact and running out ground balls could be key in the Trojans’ effort this weekend; if they put the ball in play and hustle down the line, they could take the couple of extra baserunners necessary to winning what could be a close series.
USC cannot be complacent; they took advantage of a mediocre Arizona State pitching staff to put up big numbers last weekend. But, Arizona’s staff is far too talented to allow the Trojans to just smack the ball around. There’s no doubt that Arizona has been the better team this season, but there is a path to a series win for USC. If USC secures solid pitching and good contact, they could take two games from a very talented team.
