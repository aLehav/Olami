Why don’t you sit on my d-ck,” is all Roger Greenberg has to say to his best friend Ivan after several waiters surround their table and present Greenberg with a piece of cake and sing happy birthday to him in writer-director Noah Baumbach’s most recent film, Greenberg.
The character Greenberg (Ben Stiller) is just the latest of Baumbach’s creations to share the same social tendencies of being nothing but rude, self-indulgent and utterly mean.
For the last five years, the director has created characters that in no way care to disguise or withhold their brutal feelings from one another or even from the audience watching everything unfold.
Baumbach gained his first commercial success with 2005’s The Squid and the Whale, which was nominated for the Academy Award for best original screenplay. It tells the story of Bernard and Joan Berkman, married literary snobs played by Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney, whose divorce and subsequent attempts at joint custody of their two children demonstrate an unsympathetic malevolence that is eventually adopted by their offspring.
At first, the film leads its audience to believe their abrasiveness is simply directed toward each other, as their marriage is depicted right from the first scene as merely a competition — especially since both are writers. But as the film progresses, their turmoil is revealed to stem from somewhere much deeper, and the two are shown to be just mean, simply put.
Their common self-centeredness, which is infused with subtle and endearingly dry humor, comes off as comical, but the comedic reactions to their intense gestures and outspokenness are derived simply because there is nothing else to do but laugh at them. To deal with such hostilities without some form of laughter would be impossible.
And that is Baumbach’s true gift. He is able to capture the lives of harsh people by dressing up all of their apprehensions with wit and even charm. This is exemplified most effectively as Bernard tells his eldest son that he should not be attached to his girlfriend but “play the field.”
Baumbach’s next film, 2007’s Margot at the Wedding, showcases another neurotic individual, similar to the battling parents in The Squid and the Whale. Margot, played by Nicole Kidman — in one of her best yet underrated performances — decides to visit her estranged sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), as Pauline is about to get married. However, the only reason Margot shows up for the wedding is so that she can belittle and antagonize her sister out of marrying someone she finds unworthy.
Like Baumbach’s earlier work, Margot at the Wedding features a character who is blatantly aggressive, and what makes her so vile is her inclination to do nothing but reprimand her sister. Margot, like Bernard and Joan, is naturally offensive and unable to convey any emotion besides cruelty. Baumbach’s latest character creation, Greenberg, exhibits this very same mentality.
In all of Baumbach’s films, each of the director’s nasty characters is portrayed with elaborate sophistication by whoever takes on the role. Greenberg is no exception: Stiller has not been this good since 2001’s The Royal Tenenbaums — directed by Baumbach’s buddy Wes Anderson — and it is refreshing to witness Stiller take on a more challenging role than his usual comic performances.
There is comedy here, but the film’s tendency to be just as abrasive as its characters calls for more complexity from an actor than Meet the Fockers, for example. Stiller is able to capitalize and project a truly troubled individual with ease.
Greenberg and its predecessors acknowledge a very different direction in American cinema, one that presents characters that are difficult to connect with. Baumbach himself addressed this, saying, “honestly, I really believe the characters in my movies are only unlikable, only could be seen as unlikable, in comparison to most mainstream movie characters.”
And while they are unlikable, they are still utterly fascinating because they present the extremes of human characteristics, especially those which most would choose to conceal, like harshness or a bitter outlook toward others. While such character traits might prove to be unsympathetic for many moviegoers, the human ability to be so cruel does indeed exist, and it must be addressed. Baumbach is able to masterfully explore how this other half lives.
It is Baumbach’s ability to represent cruelty with humor as well as sadness that makes his demeaning characters and all of their idiosyncrasies so appealing — their shortcomings truly do make them unique. There are very few directors that make their characters both heroes and villains, and it is through this process that Baumbach’s characters greatly exemplify all sides of humanity.

It’s difficult to say whether grief or love is the greatest emotion one can experience. Both are overwhelming, full-body sensations that tend to linger long after the damage is done.
Motherhood · Carey Mulligan, recently nominated for an Oscar for her role in An Education, plays Rose in Shana Feste’s The Greatest. - Photo courtesy of Paladin Pictures 
So it’s no surprise, then, how one can replace the other over time.
In The Greatest, a character-driven family drama that premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, first-time writer-director Shana Feste explores the numerous intricacies and nuances of emotions ranging from distress to apathy, trauma to understanding. A family is broken, a lover is struggling to pick up the pieces and the unrelenting sense of loss hangs like a heavy veil overhead.
Even the film’s prologue, a tastefully steamy scene between young lovers, is shrouded in a sense of bittersweet nostalgia from the first frame. We meet teenagers Bennett (Aaron Johnson) and Rose (Carey Mulligan) as they hurry to undress each other in the fading light of the afternoon. They’re giddy, clumsy and overcome with infatuation.
Afterward, as Bennett drives Rose home, he capriciously halts his car in the middle of a wooded, dimly lit highway. Just as he turns to Rose and says, “I love you,” a truck crashes into the sedan, and it all fades to black.
In the aftermath, we meet Bennett’s family, the Brewers: his obsessive mother Grace (Susan Sarandon), unfaithful father Allen (Pierce Brosnan) and screw-up younger brother, Ryan (Johnny Simmons). What unfolds is, at first, a by-the-numbers tale of grief and familial ties.
But between Grace’s overwrought outbursts, Allen’s steadfast determination to go about his days and Ryan’s drug binges, the Brewers are struck with another, arguably as painful, shock — Rose is pregnant with Bennett’s child.
Without a home or family of her own, Rose approaches the Brewers and, much to Grace’s resentment, is taken in by Allen. It’s a refreshing, if a bit of a deus ex machina twist that allows for fresh relationships and bonds not often seen on-screen to form.
An introspective filmmaker with an eye and ear for realism, Feste exudes a languid 70s-era sensibility often associated with independent auteurs like Robert Altman. She uses the camera as a quiet intruder, moving at a slow and steady pace through the Brewer’s household, catching in minute moments how their lives have been altered and how, more significantly, Rose struggles to desperately piece together the life of her child’s father, whom she barely knew.
Yet when compared to 2008’s Rachel Getting Married, another loosely woven family drama that set no limits on the range of the camera lens, The Greatest seems like a diluted imitation where the camera is barred from the rooms that hold the most secrets.
Although The Greatest failed to garner acclaim and hype at Sundance like several of its highly touted peers, including Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire and An Education, the film’s yearlong wait for its limited theatrical release has swiftly morphed from a frustration to a blessing in disguise.
That blessing? The new wave of success for the film’s centerpiece, Carey Mulligan.
If it were not for Mulligan, the recent Academy Award-nominated 24-year-old who has swiftly become the “It girl” in Hollywood circles, The Greatest would be standard independent fare — and average, at best.
Mulligan’s turn as Rose, however, is truly the anchor of this film, grounding not only audience members to their seats but also the on-screen characters to their oft-forgotten reality. Possessing a certain je ne sais quoi quality to her acting, Mulligan is poised without ever being mechanical. Her facial expressions, inflections and tears are exact, yet reveal themselves rawly, as if she had never experienced those emotions before. She outshines Brosnan, a typically endearing actor, in each scene, and her on-screen appearances opposite the ever-brilliant Sarandon are the most electrifying to watch.
The Greatest also features a surprise supporting performance from Michael Shannon — who plays the truck driver who rammed his tractor-trailer into Bennett’s car — that at once solidifies his 2009 Academy Award nomination for Revolutionary Road and reaffirms his status as one of the finest if underappreciated character actors working today. What stands as more of a testament to Shannon’s talent is that he does it all in a mere five minute scene — a brief but climactic encounter with Sarandon toward the film’s end.
Although the performances — save for Brosnan’s incredibly forced bawling moment — ring true to Feste’s realism, the film’s spotless ending does not. Lives this uncertain and messy do not clean up quickly without so much of a scuff mark left behind; the closure appears more rushed than honest.
This problem hinders many contemporary indie films, especially in an age where most studio-attached independent production houses have folded and distributors are few and far between. A film is much more likely to sell to a distributor (and bring in an audience) if the ending delivers closure or satisfaction to the viewers. As a result, independent films have started to lose their street cred by tying their third acts into neat, little bows instead of letting their endings unravel, leaving them torn and frayed.
Yet happy endings do not necessarily equal closure, and the audience is left more cheated than pleasant at The Greatest’s end credits.
Feste’s bold, defining voice makes her directorial debut a poignant, heartrending drama — but it’s not the greatest.

Ben Trustman paced his living room for a large portion of Thursday evening. He said he was mellow throughout the morning, but once 3 p.m. rolled around, he couldn’t sit still.
Trustman’s butterflies were completely understandable, however, because just a few hours later he would play a leading role as the Baker in the USC School of Theatre production of Into The Woods, a musical by Stephen Sondheim.
Trustman plays opposite Emily Goglia, who plays the part of the Baker’s Wife on stage and is Trustman’s best friend and roommate in real life.
The two met fall of their freshman year and have been best friends ever since.
Both have been acting since age five and have participated in multiple other performances at USC, so it couldn’t be more fitting that now, in what could be their last production as students, they were cast opposite each other.
The casting coincidence was completely unplanned — the two hadn’t even tried out together. Trustman said he is extremely thankful, though.
“It’s a blessing to be cast opposite somebody you have just as much faith and trust in as yourself,” Trustman said. “Acting to me is about reacting to the person you are opposite, and who better to do that with than my best friend?”
Trustman and Goglia plan on using their real-life chemistry to their advantage. Although the two are not romantically linked, they believe their friendship will definitely benefit their performance.
“It’s a romantic role on stage, but really the Baker and the Baker’s Wife are companions,” Goglia said. “They need each other, and we already have this strong base as friends.”
Performance is in Goglia’s blood. Her grandfather, Mike Stokey, was the host of Stump the Stars, one of the first television game shows. Her mother and grandmother were also actresses, and she says that her family is very supportive of her.
Although Goglia isn’t graduating until next semester, she is unsure if she will be able to participate in another musical this fall because of time constraints. Into The Woods could possibly be her last USC performance, which she said is bittersweet.
“I’m sad. I mean, it’s like mixed feelings … I’ve been under the bubble of USC, so it’s exciting I get to do this in the real world,” said Goglia. “I’ve gotten some really incredible experience here, so I’m ready and I’m prepared. It’s just a weird feeling and so different from doing it two years ago.”
Trustman also has mixed emotions on his USC acting career coming to a close.
“It’s bittersweet,” Trustman said. “I feel like I’ve learned so much over the past four years, and in a way it’s culminating with this show. We have such a great cast and such a great story to tell, and I’m just really excited to share it with everybody.”
Trustman plans to stay in Los Angeles and continue acting upon his graduation this spring.
“I’m hesitant to make any plans because it’s unpredictable,” Trustman said. “It’s been a long road, and it’s always been what I wanted to do since I was little.”
As if it was not enough to share the stage with your best friend in what could be your last college performance ever, it’s also worth mentioning that the USC School of Theatre production of the lesser-known Sondheim show is being directed by Tony-winner John Rubinstein, the man who originated the title role in the Broadway production of Pippin.
“He is one of the best directors I have ever worked with,” Goglia said. “He is so fun and so funny; it’s been such a treat to be working with him. He’s pretty awesome.”
Trustman agrees.
“It’s been an incredible process. John has been truly inspiring,” Trustman said. “He’s been so enlightening; he’s such a great human being.”
The show opened Thursday at 7 p.m. at Bing Theatre. It will play the remainder of this week and throughout next week.

Marking the first time in recent history an ally has been chosen to lead the group, the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Assembly recently elected sophomore Emily Allen as its next executive director.
“It’s a huge honor,” Allen said. “It’s a testament to the fact that you don’t have to be part of the LGBT community to be in this organization.”
Allen, who is straight, said involvement with the LGBT community began early in her life.
Ready to lead · Emily Allen, a sophomore majoring in psychology and English, was recently chosen to be the new executive director of the GLBTA. - Daily Trojan | Heather Lee
“My brother and my sister are both gay, so I was always very supportive,” she said.
Allen became involved with USC’s LGBT community immediately upon arriving at school, joining the Jewish Alliance for GLBTs and Straights during her first week at USC.
After serving as president of JAGS, she decided she was ready for a leadership position within the GLBTA but worried about the issues she might face as an ally.
“I was worried that people wouldn’t take me seriously for leading the organization because they might not think I’m directly affected,” Allen said. “But I am affected. It’s a huge part of my family and a huge part of my best friends’ lives.”
Allen said she thinks anyone who takes a slight interest in gay rights, whether gay marriage or the right to adopt, has a place at the GLBTA.
“People view GLBTA as an exclusive group for those who fall under that category, but it really is for everybody who is interested in showing their support,” she said.
As executive director, Allen said she hopes to implement an official ally training program to improve collaboration between GLBTA and the Greek community and work more closely with member organizations.
She also hopes to host speakers who are gay or lesbian but also work in an industry or have some kind of experience that would appeal to a larger student audience.
Joshua Morris, incoming assistant director of the GLBTA, said he thinks having an ally in the top position will only help the GLBTA.
“[Allen’s] making the definition of queer broader. She’s putting a different face on GLBTA,” he said.
Morris said he thinks having an ally at the helm will help the group increase partnerships with other student organizations and improve the visibility of the LGBT community.
Vincent Vigil, director for the LGBT Resource Center, echoed this sentiment.
“It’s very significant because, as an ally, some populations on campus would take her advocacy for the community a little more seriously than someone who is of the community,” Vigil said.
In previous years, Vigil said, the group did not do a good job of including allies in LGBT events. Since 2000, however, the GLBTA has worked to be very ally inclusive. Both Allen and Morris are hoping to continue to improve that aspect of the GLBTA during the upcoming year.
“Before, allies just didn’t know that they could be involved,” said Genevieve Flores, the current executive director of GLBTA. “[Allen] will show that this is something everyone can be involved in.”
Flores said that she hopes Allen continues the work that was done this year, especially the outreach to the Greek community.
Though he thinks having an ally lead the GLBTA will be good for the group, Vigil noted that there are some disadvantages, and that Allen will face unique obstacles.
“The challenge will be to continue to identify and understand the experiences of LGBT students on this campus,” he said. “She’s a person of privilege being an ally. She needs to comprehend what it means to be an LGBT student, and the challenge will be to continually think about that.”
Allen said she’s ready for the challenge and hopes to show the USC community that the GLBTA has something to offer everyone.
“It’s not about if you think that you’re a part of the letters,” she said. “People might think that, because they’re not gay, going to the GLBTA events might not be fun. It’s about showing support and learning something new.”
I was never asked to head this fine organization.
I would first change the name to LGBTA because women come first and also possibly change the name to LGBTCA the C is for curious for those bi-curious types.
I think that I, as a transgendered male who is bisexual and curious about a lot of things, I would be the group’s poster child.
by the way….the organization is changing their name to include allies.
If the board of mostly LGBT members wants an ally representing them,  she has every right to be there.
In fact, several allies besides Emily are already on the board.
an “ally” is head of GLBTA?? imagine if a “friendly white” was head of BSA? Absolutely insulting. 
She has NO idea how life is as an LGBTQQIA student is, but now she’s gonna program?? this PISSES me off. absolutely insulting.
Yes, heaven forbid somebody who’s not a member of the “identity group” infiltrate an organization dedicated to racism for only one color. That would totally detract from the moral and ethical standard that such an organization tries to live up to!
hani, seriously? Did you even read the article? Emily has been an active member of the LGBTQQIA for years. She has incredibly personal connections to the struggles this community faces and she has faced those struggles alongside her brother, her sister, and her many LGBTIQQ-identified friends. If anyone understands the complexities of the LGBTIQQA community, it is Emily Allen.
You clearly do not know her, you don’t know her heart, and you haven’t experienced her passion, commitment, acceptance, and understanding. YOUR immediate rejection of Emily is what is “absolutely insulting.”
As a member of the GLBT community, I am proud to have Emily Allen as the next Executive Director representing our group at USC. GLBTA is not a homogenous group of people–we are all incredibly different with incredibly different backgrounds, experiences, struggles, opinions, etc. No single person could possibly represent EVERY individual within the community perfectly. And no one should. As a community that is open and accepting of differences and individuality, we should be thrilled to have someone like Emily leading us next year.
Genevieve Flores did an AMAZING job leading GLBTA, organizing events, creating programming, etc. this year. And I know she is going to do a wonderful job training the next E-board and help a smooth transition take place.
…uh…we ELECTED HER. 
it’s not like she was forced upon us…she won a majority vote by the GLBTA. i guess maybe i don’t know what being LGBTQQIA is like either…? oh wait, I AM GAY.
how presumptuous of you. emily allen is going to do a great job.
I personally know Ms. Allen and I am incredibly excited for the advocacy work that she plans on doing for the LGBT community next year.  She has the knowledge, compassion, and enthusiasm to be a great leader. Although she does not identify as LGB or T, she was easily the best fit for the position. GO EMILY ALLEN!
Using the term “ally” presented without a definition is kind of unprofessional from a journalism standpoint. Not every reader is up on the latest slang. But don’t worry, I figured it out. When I was in college, we had a different term for the straight girls who hang out with gay guys.

After notching its first two conference wins last weekend, the USC men’s tennis team is coming home to face two top-20 conference rivals this weekend.
The No. 4 Trojans (16-2, 2-0) are coming off a four-match road stretch to face No. 7 Stanford (11-4, 1-0) on Friday at 1:30 p.m.
This will be the Trojans’ fifth match against a team ranked in the top 10 this season. USC holds a 3-1 record against top-10 opponents.
In late February, USC traveled to Palo Alto, Calif., and narrowly defeated Stanford, 4-3, in an unusual match where singles play was decided before doubles play.
In that match, No. 15 senior Robert Farah, No. 104 junior Peter Lucassen and No. 83 sophomore Daniel Nguyen won their singles matches.
USC displayed toughness in the doubles play with juniors Jaak Poldma and Lucassen winning 9-7, and sophomores Steve Johnson and Nguyen winning 9-8 (3) to clinch the match victory against Stanford’s tough doubles lineup.
The Trojans have won their last three matches against Stanford, but all of these recent battles were closely contested.
“We know Stanford extremely well and have a ton of respect for them,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “We know how tough a match it will be and how tough the matches have been in the past, so our mindset has to be ready for a battle.”
On Saturday, USC will continue to battle it out against No. 17 California (10-4, 1-0) in the first meeting between the squads this year.
A previously scheduled match against the Golden Bears was cancelled because of rain.
Cal has three ranked singles players — No. 16 Pedro Zerbini, No. 71 Christoffer Konigsfeldt,                                No. 116 Jonathan Dahan — and two ranked doubles teams — No. 23 Nick Andrews and Konigsfeldt and No. 26 Dahan and Zerbini.
With back-to-back matches against the Bay Area schools, USC hopes to continue to build on the success they have had so far this season.
“We have prepared the whole season for these matches,” Smith said. “This is all part of the process of getting us ready for NCAAs; I’m looking for our discipline and toughness to come out.”
With all of the miles the Trojans have acquired traveling throughout the country, the team is glad to play in familiar surroundings.
“We are happy to be coming home,” Smith said. “Looking forward to a good crowd at the Stanford and Cal matches this weekend.”

Make yourselves at home, Trojans.
The No. 12 USC men’s golf team will tee off today on its first of two tournaments in the span of four weeks at Arizona State’s same Karsten Golf Course.

This weekend’s tournament, the 38th annual Thunderbird Invitational, will feature all of the   Pac-10 teams, as well as five squads from other conferences, including  No. 9 UNLV.
The Trojans will return to the desert April 26 for the Pac-10 championships.
“It’s an opportunity to play competitive golf on a course we have a real important championship on within one month,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “We’re killing two birds with one stone here.”
USC will also get an opportunity to see where it stacks up against other top Pac-10 teams. No. 2 Stanford, No. 6 Washington, No. 7 UCLA, No. 11 Arizona State and No. 15 Oregon are all threats to win the conference title.
The Trojans come into the Thunderbird Invitational on the heels of their best tournament finish of the season. USC placed second in the      16-team field at the Callaway Match Play Championship, losing to New Mexico in the title match.
“We’re confident with the way we’ve been playing in the last few tournaments,” junior Matt Giles said. “Hopefully, we can continue to build on that.”
USC will send out the same five-man lineup for the third consecutive tournament, a sign that Zambri has found the right combination.
“Right now our team looks pretty solid,” Zambri said. “But there’s still time for some guys to get in to the top five that aren’t in there now.”
The Trojans will be led by freshman T.J. Vogel, who was red hot during March. Vogel finished in second place at the USC Collegiate Invitational and the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters before going 3-1 at the match play event.
Sophomore Steve Lim also went 3-1 in match play and has posted three top-15 finishes on the season.
“I’m feeling confident about my game,” Lim said. “The course this week is not that long so there are a lot of opportunities.”
Giles, a two-time All-American, is still searching for the stroke that had him ranked as the No. 1 player in college golf for a long stretch last spring. Giles won two of his matches last week, however, and is feeling better about his play.
“I’m feeling good. Everything is starting to come together nicely,” Giles said.
Freshmen Martin Trainer, who went 3-1 in match play, and Stewart Hagestad, 1-3, round out the starters for USC. Redshirt junior Bo DeHuff will play as an individual.
“The freshmen are learning. They’re stepping up, and we’re ready to win this week,” Lim said.
The tournament begins today with 36 holes of play. The final round is scheduled for Saturday.

Silva Sevlian has always wanted to travel to Ethiopa, the country where her mother was born and raised. Now, with the help of USC’s new Africa Student Fund, Sevlian will have a chance to do just that.
Sevlian, who is in enrolled in the B.A./M.A. joint program in print journalism and public diplomacy, is one of the three inaugural winners of the grant, which sponsors travel and research in Africa. She will use the award to film a documentary about Ethiopian subculture.
The other winners, Emily Taymor, a freshman majoring in cinema-television production, and Daniel Alvarado, a senior majoring in art history, will visit Senegal and Mozambique, respectively.
The fund, which was announced in 2008, is an endowment that supports undergraduates who want to travel to Africa for study, research, service learning or internships. Recipients are given about $2,000 to cover travel expenses.
Adam Powell, the vice provost for globalization and the founder of the Africa Student Fund, said the discussion about expanding student travel started in fall 2007.
“After talking with faculty and students, the question started coming up. What are people doing? And what can we do in the provost’s office to be helpful?” he said.
Powell said there were opportunities for students to get research funding from various foundations, but that didn’t solve the issue of costly plane tickets.
“The piece that’s almost impossible to get is student travel,” he said. “The basic idea is to eliminate the price of the plane ticket. That’s what led to the funds.”
Powell and his wife made the initial contribution to start the fund, donating $100,000.
This year, the Africa Advisory Committee chose three recipients from 19 total applications. Powell said the decision was tough.
“What the committee found was that these students were somewhat unusual; they played to the strengths of USC, and they really showed how this trip would really complement and enhance their education,” he said.
Sevlian said the award means a lot to her for both personal and professional reasons. Her trip, she noted, will combine both her fields of study.
“It’s kind of a marriage between the two things I’m studying,” Sevlian said. “I’m applying what I’ve learned in print journalism, and the most important thing I think stood out was my multimedia skills.”
Sevlian also hopes to contribute her work to a good cause. She plans to compile a database for African scholars here at USC and provide information to the Institute for Armenian Studies.
Sevlian, who will be staying with family members in Ethiopia this summer, said the fund makes the entire trip possible.
“The Africa fund eliminates the cost of the plane ride and makes the gap between USC and Africa much smaller,” she said. “I envision a lot of personal growth on this trip. I am not only visiting but becoming part of the community and the documentation of it.”
Taymor said she was already planning on doing a project in Senegal when she came across the fund.
“We were looking for funding, and I came across this grant. It seemed like a great opportunity,” she said.
Taymor will be working on pre-production for her film, which will be about a girl who contracts HIV and is forced into an early arranged marriage, she said.
“The main idea is to help stop arranged marriages and the spread of HIV,” Taymor said. “I want to use this film as a mechanism for spreading awareness.”
She also plans to create a non-profit organization so that she can encourage USC students to support her project. “The film itself is just the first step,” Taymor said. 
Taymor said the Africa fund is a catalyst for her long-term ambitions.
“The Africa fund helps me with the film project,” Taymor said, “But it is also the start of what I hope to do later in life. This is an opportunity not many people get to have.”
Alvarado is currently in Mozambique for a month, conducting research on the impact of Portuguese colonial urbanism and architecture; he began this project during a semester abroad in Brazil. Alvarado will use the money from the fund to continue his research in Mozambique.
“I would not have been able to execute this project without the Africa fund,” Alvarado wrote in an e-mail.
Applications for next year’s fund are due in November. To apply, a student must have a 3.5 grade point average as well as a faculty recommendation.
Although he sees room for growth, Powell said he was impressed with the variety of applications this year.
“We had almost every school represented in the applications,” said Powell.
Powell said this program has already emerged as a popular choice on campus.
“There is so much interest and so much activity in so many areas. Part of our job is to focus on what are the main things that can be most helpful to students,” Powell said. “The student fund has risen to the top as number one.”

USC’s Master of Accounting program at the Leventhal School was recently ranked one of the top-10 most popular programs for Chinese citizens applying to graduate business schools — the only non-MBA program to make the cut.
Rising numbers · The Leventhal School of Accounting’s Master of Accounting program was recently named one of the top-10 choices for graduate students from China looking to study business. - Daily Trojan | Geo Tu
According to the Geographic Trend Report for Graduate Management Admission Test Examinees, USC Leventhal’s Master of Accounting program was ranked 10th among the programs to which Chinese citizens sent their GMAT score reports in 2009.
Shirley Maxey, a director of the Leventhal masters program, said the ranking is significant for Leventhal.
“It means a lot for the program,” Maxey said. “It means we’re going to continue to have a rising number of applications, and that’s great for the school.”
Harvard, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford topped the list of the most popular schools among Chinese applicants.
“The top ten are all great universities,” Maxey said. “It’s just amazing we’re on that list.”
Cindy Wu, a student in the program who is originally from the Guangdong Province in China, said she made her decision based on the rankings she found online.
“USC was right at the top of the list,” Wu said. “And it was one of only two schools that offered a Master of Accounting program.”
The school received about 475 applications for the 2010-2011 school year, according to Cathy Cowan, a director of the program. Two years ago, the program received less than half this number.
USC has increased its acceptance of international students over the past five years, Maxey said, noting that other programs across the nation were reducing their numbers because of the difficulty of placing international students in career positions in the United States.
In China and many other Asian countries, the reputation of a university can be a big factor in the decision to attend, Maxey said.
Yifeng Song, a student in the program, heard about it while she was majoring in international business at Guangzhou University in China.
“I wanted to pursue accounting here because it’s highly ranked among these kinds of programs,” Song said. “USC has a really good reputation in China.”
Maxey noted that many applicants have told her USC is their dream school.
“[USC] was my top choice,” Song said. “It’s a highly recognized program throughout China, so it will help if I go back to China to work.”
The Master of Accounting program has started receiving so many applications from China that it now sends interviewers from Leventhal overseas to conduct interviews with the applicants.
The program has also made great efforts to reach out to prospective students. Two of USC’s accounting faculty members, Thomas Lin and Shiing-Wu Wang, have both traveled to China at least once per year for more than a decade to speak at conferences and establish ties with academics in Shanghai and Beijing, Maxey said.
Maxey said part of the reason for Leventhal’s increasing popularity could be the recent economic growth in China, which has resulted in higher demand for trained accounting professionals throughout the country.
The program also makes a point to put international and domestic students together in the same classrooms, Maxey said. She said both groups benefit from the experience of working and learning together in the classroom setting.
Students said the atmosphere of Southern California was also a factor in the decision to come to USC.
“The faculty are excellent, and it’s in a good location,” Song said. “I love it here. That’s how I can adapt to the new life, the new language and the new learning methods.”
Song said she also appreciated the strong network of USC alumni throughout the world and that an education in the United States has broadened her horizons.
“Pursuing study is also about experiencing a new culture and a new life, especially for international students,” she said.
Joe,
Advanced economies prize professional services and the exchange of information, not simply those with the ability to sustain the infrastructure that conducts the relatively mundane task of transmitting that information. I make a very good living in marketing and public relations.
UnAmerican, maybe you should try encouraging some American kids to buckle down and study useful subjects like accounting, engineering, computer science, medicine, architecture, etc, instead of getting all huffy at the Chinese for doing so. Some of the most popular majors for American college students are psychology (worthless), political science (worthless), marketing (the least practical major in the business school), and a bunch of other useless fluffy subjects.
In other words, don’t blame the Chinese for investing in the future. Blame America for selling it.
It’s China’s turn to shine right? China owns a vast majority of the U.S. T-bills, essentially they own the U.S. The yuan is undervalued favoring China in its exports. 
Now they own USC as well. It’s no longer the “University of Southern California.” It’s the “University Subsidized by the Chinese.” 
When is USC going to stop riding on Chinese students’ preferences to boost their reputation? Is USC losing its focus as an American university?

Ask around and it’s not hard to see that Tim Floyd doesn’t have the greatest of reputations on the USC campus.
Sure, the former men’s basketball coach — who was hired March 29 to take the helm at the University of Texas at El Paso — compiled a very respectable 85-50 record in his four seasons with the Trojans, led the team to three straight NCAA tournament appearances and a Pac-10 title, managed to vault USC into only its second Sweet 16 birth in school history and constructed what is arguably the best three-year stretch in school basketball history.
Even his sternest critics agree that his on-the-court influence was impressive.
Rather, it was what he did off the court that left a sour taste in the mouths of Trojan basketball fans everywhere and ultimately tarnished his image as a successful coach and a catalyst for growth and progress within the program.
Obviously, the questionable recruiting methods for high school phenom O.J. Mayo — which has since become a large enough issue to warrant an NCAA investigation and self-imposed sanctions against the team — headlines Floyd’s list of slip-ups, but it wasn’t simply rule breaking that garnered ill will toward the coach.
Floyd’s lack of an emotional connection to his players and the school as a whole became evident in the final months he served here as head coach. This was supported by both his words — “Kansas has two players who would have been NBA lottery picks, Cole Aldrich and Sherron Collins, and they are returning to school. Good for them. Our guys get an offer from Islamabad and they’re gone,” he told boosters, in reference to Marcus Johnson’s consideration to go pro (Johnson ended up staying at USC for the rest of his eligibility) — and his actions.
Floyd, unbeknownst to even his players at the time, bolted for Arizona when the Wildcats offered him a coaching job, then turned it down (despite coming so close to accepting the offer that even ESPN.com reported he had taken the position), only to suddenly resign from the team two months later citing a lack of enthusiasm for the job.
In the course of one summer, USC went from having many of the tools necessary to make a run deep into the NCAA tournament to having no coach, no recruits and little chance to continue its success of the last four years.
While some may call Floyd selfish or a downright cheater, I see the problem not with him but with the environment to which he was thrust in so suddenly in 2005.
For those who don’t remember, Rick Majerus was originally selected to lead the Trojans, but an unexpected resignation just five days after his hiring left Floyd in the driver’s seat with full control. He had the weight of a win-hungry student body, a new arena and a talented young team all resting on his shoulders — a large pressure for any coach, let alone one who had recently struggled in his last couple of head coaching gigs.
Floyd had to win, and he had to win immediately. And he did.
But the intangibles that were lost in the rushed process of building a national contender — team unity, a selfless mentality — prevented the team, despite its successes on the court, from ever really developing a bond with the school they represented; Floyd was good at winning, but that seemed to be the extent of his benefit to the Trojans.
With this in mind, as Floyd takes the head coaching position at UTEP next season, I do not see the same external factors present that caused a whirlwind of rumors and a quick resignation from USC. Actually, I cannot imagine a better place in which the baggage-laden coach could re-energize his career.
Obviously, it’s a plus that he is taking the reins of a team fresh off an NCAA tournament appearance and a top-25 ranking. It also helps that UTEP is far away from the neverending recruiting tug-of-war and temptation that got Floyd in trouble in the first place during his time at USC.
But the main reason that UTEP fits Floyd more than USC is because this is not a first-time trip to El Paso for him by any means; it is almost a homecoming of sorts, as Floyd both lived there as a child and served nine years as an assistant under former UTEP coach Don Haskins from 1978 to 1986.
Haskins took an inexperienced Floyd (who admits himself that he wasn’t qualified for the assistant position) under his wing and gave him the tools necessary to become a successful head coach, which essentially allowed him to navigate the world of collegiate and professional athletics and make a name for himself.
That is why the opportunity to return to the place where he got his first real shot is not something that Floyd will take lightly; his connection with the team, as well as the team’s history, is something special — and something that he never had in any of his previous jobs.
So although Floyd’s coaching career has been filled with rumors, missed opportunities and many job changes, it seems like he is finally on the right track to prove his worth in the basketball world.
All it took was a trip back to where it all began.

Day two of the Lane Kiffin era was nearly identical to day one — lots of second teamers, lots of intensity and a heavy emphasis on discipline.
The Trojans still have more than a dozen players out of action, giving many of the second teamers an opportunity to get their reps in.
“It was a really good opportunity for those guys that need double reps to get better,” said coach Lane Kiffin.
Those second teamers filled in at a variety of positions, including center when junior Kris O’ Dowd went down with a knee injury. Details on the injury were sparse, but O’Dowd was held out of practice the rest of the day.  He was expected to see a doctor soon after practice.
“We obviously don’t want to push him through, it being spring practice,” Kiffin said.
That same sentiment was extended to junior tight end Blake Ayles, who was held out of Tuesday’s practice.
Ayles participated in limited drills, but most of the tight end reps went to senior David Ausberry and fourth-year junior Jordan Cameron.  Kiffin described the two as “the number one and two tight ends right now.”
Ausberry, a wide receiver for the last three seasons, was moved to tight end because the injury to Ayles and redshirt junior Rhett Ellison catching mononucleosis.  The move is permanent for now, according to Kiffin, because “we just don’t have the numbers.”
Besides moving players to new positions, the team added 14 new walk-ons yesterday, and may be hosting an additional tryout in the future.
—
The intensity present on day one remained, in part thanks to a new special teams drill.
“It’s a kickoff-kickoff coverage drill,” special teams coach John Baxter said.
The first-year coach is looking to inject some intensity into special teams drills that usually lack it.  The team was divided into four tribes, like in the TV show Survivor. The teams compete against each other and against themselves for points.
“The person with the least amount of points, the team as a whole has to vote them off,” said senior running back Allen Bradford, the captain of team Atlas.
As the captain, Bradford is responsible for maintaining the team flag, an elaborate drawing of Atlas holding up a football-shaped Earth.  The competition encouraged by the game is designed to bring the team and the staff together, said defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin.
“Once we get to the fall, there’s only one flag that matters, and that’s the one with the ’SC on it,” Baxter said.  The intensity built in the special teams drill was present throughout the defensively dominated practice.
—
Practice ended with the traditional 11 on 11 scrimmage, highlighted by redshirt junior defensive tackle Da’John Harris tipping a Matt Barkley pass and subsequently intercepting it.
“I’ve been dreaming about that play since I got here,” Harris said.  “It was too perfect.”

With USC and UC Irvine deadlocked at three in the fifth and final set of what has become one of the best rivalries in collegiate men’s volleyball, it appeared Trojans’ sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli would be called for an illegal maneuver, which aided an easy kill for USC.
After more than a minute in which the No. 11 Anteaters (11-13, 6-11) vehemently pleaded with the line judge to reconsider her call, the point was awarded to No. 6 USC (12-9, 9-8), a call symbolic of a match in which the Trojans did just enough to get by.
For the second time this season, USC needed late game heroics to prevail over the defending NCAA champions, in a match with stakes higher than their five-set come-from-behind victory over the Anteaters in January.
“Through all of the adversity, these guys have come to the gym everyday looking to get better as a team,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “They say that you learn more about people’s character during times of adversity, and after a match like tonight’s I can say that right now I am pretty happy with the character of this team.”
In the first set, however, it was urgency, not adversity, that propelled USC to a nail-biting 32-30 set victory, thanks in large part to the five service aces contributed by four different players.
Despite the momentum gained in the first set, the Anteaters — behind reigning Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Freshman of the Year Carson Clark and Corey Yoder, son of USC volleyball legend Bob Yoder — crawled their way back into the match with consecutive set victories (30-28, 30-22). Clark, who early in the second set suffered a bloody nose in a nasty spill along the sideline, had a match-high 29 kills in defeat.
But as has been the case all season, the Trojans’ battled back in the fourth set in large part because of four critical errors by UCI’s Clark and outside hitter Jordan Default. Down the stretch, the Trojans relied on the killer instincts of outside hitters Ciarelli and junior Murphy Troy to close the set, as each contributed four kills.
In the final set, Ciarelli’s controversial helper essentially ended the match. After the Anteaters lost in their desperate attempt to reverse the call, the Trojans took advantage of a team who virtually checked out moments after its futile debate ended. Ciarelli would add seven kills in the final frame, as USC put the finishing touches on a match that truly served as a testament to its resolve.
The Trojans will close out the home portion of the season Saturday night at 7 p.m. against their crosstown rivals, the No. 7 UCLA Bruins. The match will be the teams’ second showdown of the season, with USC taking the first clash over UCLA (14-9, 9-7) in four sets back on Jan. 13.

In its first of three games slated to be played over the next three days, the USC women’s water polo team notched an impressive 15-6 home victory over Brown in nonconference play at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, marking the team’s 15th consecutive win.
Young leader · Freshman two-meter Patricia Jancso’s three goals helped the Women of Troy cruise to a 15-6 victory over Brown. Jancso ranks second on the team in goals scored. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
No. 1 USC (15-1, 4-0) watched its offense overpower a No. 20 Brown defense that at times looked almost helpless to do anything to stop the Women of Troy’s overwhelming attack.
“We are a good offensive team,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic following the game. “We have some good outside shooters. We have good two-meter players as well.”
One of those players happens to be freshman two-meter Patricia Jancso, who ranks second on the team in goals scored in 2010. Against Brown, the Hungarian native put her offensive prowess on display for all to enjoy by netting a hat trick — and all three goals came during the first three quarters. But as usual, the Women of Troy’s offensive onslaught was not limited to simply one individual.
Four other players — senior driver Kally Lucas, junior driver Joelle Bekhazi, senior two-meter Kami Craig and sophomore driver Nadia Dan — tallied two goals apiece, with a total of nine players getting on the scoreboard at least once. Such balanced scoring has become a staple for USC under the leadership of Vavic.
“Collectively, we can score goals,” Vavic said. “That’s nothing new. It’s just now we’re actually putting the ball in the net.”
But even with the team’s success on offense, the Women of Troy committed several uncharacteristic fouls and had a few defensive miscues that kept the game closer than many would have liked.
“I didn’t like some of the calls but in the end we were just tired,” Vavic said. “I knew this week wasn’t going to be the same as when we normally get to rest the players. Whenever you’re tired, you don’t think, you don’t focus. So that results in some of the mental errors we committed today.”
As a result, Brown was able to notch a total of six goals — the third-highest scoring output any team has had against the Women of Troy this season.
“I think we were a little tired and that showed,” Vavic added.
With Thursday’s victory over Brown now in the history books, the Women of Troy will once again be forced to bounce back quickly with a Saturday double-header against No. 19 Cal State Bakersfield and No. 10 Cal State Northridge at home. However, neither game will be a cake walk, as both teams are considered to be among the best on the West Coast, particularly the Matadors, who already have 20 wins on the year and feature one of the top goal scorers in the country in Whitney Delgado.
Stopping Delgado, who has already notched 53 goals on the year, will be the team’s highest priority if they plan on leaving the weekend with two more wins in hand.

With a season of ups-and-downs complete, the USC men’s basketball team took some time out on Tuesday night to acknowledge some of the best performers during the season.
The Trojans took part in the annual awards banquet at the Founders Club at the Galen Center on March 30, where many of the team’s members were honored for their contribution to the 16-14 record and fifth-place finish in the Pac-10.
Senior guards Mike Gerrity and Dwight Lewis were named co-MVPs on the night for their important contributions. Gerrity, who only played one semester, made the most of his time at USC, averaging 9.3 points and 3.6 assists per game while maintaining a positive assist to turnover ratio.
Lewis, who graduates as the Trojan’s all-time leader in games played, averaged 13.8 points on the season in his final year.
Sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic was rewarded with the team’s most improved player award and the award for leading the team in rebounding (9.4 boards per game)
Junior guard Marcus Simmons won his second Tom Kimmel 6th Man Award, and shared the Forrest F. Twogood Memorial Award with redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson for best defensive player.

The USC School of Pharmacy recently began a new Ph.D program in Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics (CXPT) designed to bridge the gap between experimentation and implementation in medicine.
The program, which is part of the Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, arose from a movement in the pharmacy community to better integrate research and clinical therapeutics. As an interdisciplinary degree, the program aims to train graduate students as translational scientists who can cross connect between basic scientific discoveries and clinical applications.
“There is a national shortage of scientists who could really bridge clinical care of patients with basic science and investigation at the molecular level. This program is unique in that its goal is to train scientists who could be “bilingual” in both worlds,” said Dr. Annie Wong-Beringer, vice chair of the Titus Family Department, who led the development of this program.
The USC School of Pharmacy is the first on the west coast to offer such a program. The program is different in that students work with human samples as well as humans in clinical trials.
As of now, there are only three students enrolled in the program and, as Wong-Beringer said, the program will most likely accept a maximum of only 10 students at a time.

Every year thousands of people wait for lineup announcements from the world’s largest music festivals. Coachella is usually one of the first festivals to announce its lineup. After months of diverse rumors — involving David Bowie — the organizers announced the lineup, provoking many different reactions that were generally horrible but intrigued.
As months pass, other festivals will continue to announce their lineups. Bonaroo and Sasquatch will be the first,  followed later by the more local festivals ACL, Outside Lands and All Points West .
In recent years the festival that has gotten most of the positive attention is Lollapalooza. It has developed a certain mystique like Coachella, but generally offers a more intriguing lineup. The bulk of the lineup at all major festivals tend to be the same — some indie bands get all of the attention and those bands are the ones actually worth watching. But it’s the headliners that can vary quite a bit and can really make or break festivals like these.
On Wednesday this week, Chicago’s Lollapalooza launched a Wheel Of Fortune-like guessing game to uncover the lineup. It will uncover one letter at a time until we can all see the lineup at the end. It creates more intrigue than just uncovering all of the information at once and makes users visit their site multiple times to finally get all of the bands.
The letters “O” and “R” have been uncovered and they help to confirm many rumors that have been flying around about the headliners. The spaces in the first line fit SOundgaRden, GReen Day, Lady Gaga, ARcade FiRe and The StROkes. If these predictions are correct, this makes Lollapalooza a thousand times more interesting than Coachella’s Jay Z, Muse and Gorillaz, primarily because of Arcade Fire and the newly reunited Strokes.
It will be very interesting to see what is in store for everyone in Lollapalooza as more letters get uncovered. We’ll only know once all the letters have been revealed, but it already feels like Aug. 6, 7 and 8 are going to be great days to be in the Windy City.

Most of us received this message in high school: work really, really hard, and it’ll pay off — literally. In the world of college applications, being accepted is only half the deal; students must find ways to finance their studies. Colleges attract above-average high school students with hefty scholarships, promising to lessen the financial burden if those students keep up their academic achievement. USC offers scholarships that pay half or full tuition as long as recipients maintain a 3.0 grade point average or above.
But what about students who don’t get a scholarship from the get-go?
Because of the way financial aid works at most institutions, many middle class students are stuck in an awkward position. Students without scholarships have two main options: Opt for public school or take a risk with a dream college. In light of public university budget cuts, many students who stick with option two take out massive loans, in hopes that their educations will pay off.
One only has to look at our faltering economy to see that loans are not always safe. Yet, it can be hard to tell a student to give up on that dream school.
It is for this reason that USC should offer more merit-based financial assistance to continuing college students. USC didn’t make Princeton Review’s Top-10 Dream College list by accident. The school has a unique ability to foster top academic and professional programs, abundant school spirit and a tight-knit alumni network.
Yet USC students face one of the steepest tuitions in the country. The university offers some merit-based awards to current students, but these tend to be very small and hard to get; moreover, they are often available only to students in certain ethnic or religious groups.
USC took a step in the right direction with the Academic Achievement Award. The award allows dual- program students with a GPA of 3.75 or higher to take up to 20 units for the price of 18. In other words, it can save a student up to $3,897 per semester. Along with helping students pursue multiple disciplines, the award will allow some students to graduate in three years and, thus, avoid paying another $50,000.
This award’s strength lies in its simplicity. On one hand, the requirements are straightforward: Students will not have to write lengthy, heartfelt essays for a few thousand dollars. On the other hand, it rewards the right people: continuing students who, scholarship or no scholarship, have proven themselves to be extremely hard workers.
The university should recognize that not everyone shows their full academic potential in their earlier teenage years. Anything from difficult home life, an unstimulating high school environment, to immigration status can prevent students from truly showing what they’re capable of until college. Like how scholarship students must remain focused to keep their status, other students should be encouraged to excel academically with the possibility of merit-based financial assistance. That assistance doesn’t have to pay for anyone’s entire tuition — the hefty scholarships are and should be reserved for recruitment. But small measures can motivate students with potential. Moreover, it can encourage students who do not receive scholarships to take a chance with USC.
Working hard and getting rewarded should not be reserved for high school. If there’s one thing USC stresses, it’s opportunity — the idea that possibilities are always available for those who seek them out. In the name of that ideal, let us not push potential Trojans to UCLA.

Thank you for an excellent article.My nephew,who will graduate from high school in 2011,found it quite useful.
We can count on USC to provide many sources of financial aid.
Thanks to USC,I passed the Foreign Service exam on the first try. Best of luck with your plans for the future.
I found this really refreshing.  Great information!

On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized its study of a permit program designed to curb the release of greenhouse emissions. After evaluating the program for more than a year, the EPA concluded with a decision to delay the factory pollution permits to January 2011.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The permit is required for a new factory facility to be built or for an existing one to expand, both of which result in significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions. The decision, according to EPA administrator Lisa Jackson, was reached in order to give “facilities the time they need to innovate, governments the time to prepare to cut greenhouse gases and it ensures that we don’t push this problem off to our children and grandchildren.”
As the national standard for regulation of environmental problems, the EPA’s inaction is quite disheartening.
In fact, it seems that it has become a game of sorts to decide on whether to appease businesses, legislators and environmentalists.
The current environmental crisis has the potential to incur wide-ranging, complicated consequences on the world’s climate.  However, the process for regulating greenhouse emissions should not be as difficult.
This year, I participated on an environmentally focused alternative spring break trip, prior to which a professor from the Wrigley Institute spoke to us about climate change and what our apathy toward the environment has caused. I left the lecture slightly dumbfounded at his cynicism — apparently, the problem of climate change was so huge that even institutional efforts serve little purpose, so we might as well enjoy what nature we have left while we can.
I initially found our work on Orcas Island steeped in irony. In the interest of conservation, we were installing fire pits in the state park. But why have fire pits at all? Doesn’t it essentially encourage infringement on pristine natural grounds by allowing fires?
It seems that the state park, and others, have struck a compromise with the rest of us. Since families are bound to go camping anyway, however, there have to be regulations to prevent unsafe activities in the wilderness. Designated fire pits prevent wildfires by providing designated safe areas.
Likewise, the EPA knows that certain businesses — major sources of stationary heat-trapping gases — will inevitably spew large amounts of greenhouse gases by the nature of their work. Delaying the pollution permits in order to let them individually decide on emission curbing practices only exacerbates the situation.
At this point, it might be wishful thinking to hope the EPA will swiftly crack down on emissions, let alone hope for congressional legislation on global climate change to pass. For one, the buzzword “cap and trade,” as strongly endorsed in President Barack Obama’s initial budget, is tarnishing in value. Instead, the Obama administration hopes to move to more modest goals in order to make cap and trade legislation more passable for Congress.
Indeed, mandates, or at least regulations, should be put in place to change the game. Businesses will be driven by government or market incentives in any situation, and the EPA’s decision to delay the pollution permit regulation isn’t telling of its position as a so-called protector of the environment. It claims that successful emissions trading programs will “provide strict environmental accountability without inhibiting economic growth.” But those results, unfortunately, won’t be visible until at least a year’s time.
Until then, leaving it up to the facilities’ and governments’ discretion will not be the most effective, game-changing decision. At this rate, pushing the problem off to our children and grandchildren seems like a hopeful scenario.

Nadine, why don’t you go Google “climategate” and “IPCC fraud”? Global warming is a myth, and more people realize it than ever. The left’s opportunity to use global warming hysteria to impose the things they want (destruction of capitalism, massive new taxes, world government) is past. 
If you really care about the environment, instead of using it as an excuse for socialism, then I suggest you consider keeping up the conservation work. Real environmentalism, the kind that Teddy Roosevelt pioneered with the national parks, is the kind of work you were doing on Orcas Island — making it possible for humans to enjoy nature without destroying it.
