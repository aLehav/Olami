Sarah Kim | Daily TrojanGet schooled · David Turner, a representative from the Social Justice Learning Institute, explained the school-to-prison-pipeline Thursday.
Panelists discussed police influence and brutality inside and outside of classrooms at “Hands RaisED: Policing in the Classroom and on the Streets” on Thursday evening. The event, hosted by USC’s Academic Culture Assembly in cooperation with the USC Black Student Assembly, is part of the ACA’s EdMonth.
EdMonth is a month long student-led program dedicated to educating and raising awareness among USC students about the state of education within the United States. EdMonth hopes to bridge the Los Angeles and USC communities and prioritize marginalized students by giving them a platform to face educational inequality directly. 
Natalie Nguyen, a senior majoring in chemical engineering, coordinated the event and said that the nationwide debate over police tactics in minority communities influenced EdMonth’s decision to focus on educational justice this year.
“The purpose of this event is in order to discuss the intersection between police brutality and the school-to-prison pipeline and also build community,” Nguyen said.
The panel featured David Turner, a representative from the Social Justice Learning Institute; Tauheedah Shakur, a former Los Angeles Unified School District student and organizer; Shantel Vachani, a professor at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and an education attorney; and Preston Fregia, the unity chair of the BSA. 
Vachani began the discussion by defining the school-to-prison pipeline and through her experience as an education attorney, how students are being pushed out by the educational system into another system because of disabilities they have induced by mental trauma experienced within their environment. 
“When a young person acts out because they have an underlying disability or manifestation, at that same time they might have rights in the educational setting,” Vachani said.
Fregia expressed his own personal stance on race, racism and police brutality.
“When asked a question of how do cases of police brutality outside the classroom affects students of color I answer with: The anger stems from the fact that students of color have to live inside of the illusions of another man’s reality,” Fregia said.
Tauheedah Shakur also shared her own experience with racism and the school-to-prison pipeline during her school years at Crenshaw High School. 
“My peers were treated like they were criminals while they’re in school. Now this affects a lot of people of color. TV shows us that we are nothing but thugs and killers. If TV shows us that, and our homes aren’t good, and school isn’t good, what is supposed to be good? What is supposed to be normal?” Shakur said.
Turner took on a more historical perspective. He discussed how the school-to-prison pipeline came into existence. He explained how the phenomena occurred as a response by the government in order to try and deal with the black power movement. 
“The foundations for what we know as the school-to-prison pipeline were laid by the black power movement,” Turner said. 
The panel addressed specific issues within LAUSD. The broader implication, as discussed by the panelist, is that these issues can be seen throughout the country and are not singularly a county or state issue. The understanding is that these issues of concentrated disadvantage exist by design and need to be recognized. Subsequently, more needs to be done in order to fix the situation. 
“If we are really going to advance this idea educational justice, then we have to be really explicit about race,” Turner said.

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanPeople over pipelines · The Native American Student Union, Young Democratic Socialists and Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation organized a rally to stand in solidarity with Native Americans and oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline Thursday at Tommy Trojan.
Members of the Native American Student Union, Young Democratic Socialists and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation gathered at Tommy Trojan Thursday afternoon to protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, an oil conduit passing near the ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The students hope to raise awareness of the struggles that Native Americans face as well as the environmental issues raised by the project.
The Dakota Access Pipeline Project is a 1,172 mile, 30-inch diameter pipeline that aims to connect production areas in North Dakota to the existing pipeline in Illinois through South Dakota and Iowa in order to transport crude oil. The pipeline, if completed, would transport approximately 470,000 barrels per day. 
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, located in North and South Dakota, is a sovereign nation that makes decisions regarding the general welfare of its people, their property and the environment. This summer, a group of activists from the tribe filed a petition to stop the Energy Transfer Partners company from constructing a pipeline near the Missouri River in North Dakota. Ongoing protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters led a federal appeals court to order a temporary halt to a section of the construction on Sept. 17.
“The purpose of the protest is two-fold,” said Ben Hiller, a member of the executive board of the Young Democratic Socialists. “The first is for environmental reasons, and the second is solidarity with the indigenous people of the Midwest. Approximately 35 percent of mining and oil extraction from the ground occurs on sovereign lands that rightfully belong to indigenous people.”
Lynn Wang, a junior majoring in environmental studies, said that she is concerned because the pipeline represents continuous disrespect toward indigenous rights in the United States.
“Their rights are seriously being infringed by the construction of the pipeline,” Wang said. “As victims of genocide, they deserve our respect and consideration. We believe that continuously working to prevent these infringements on their sovereignty is very important just to maintain the human rights they are entitled to.”
For Sienna Tso, an undeclared sophomore, this issue is close to home because she is a Native American. Tso, a member of the Navajo tribe, said that because the pipeline will cross the Missouri River, upstream of its water intake pipes, the tribe fears for the safety of its drinking water.
“Water is a basic human right that we need to make sure our people have,” Tso said. “[The protest] hopefully will spread the message to people on campus, because there is not a huge Native American demographic here.” 
According to David Delgado, a junior majoring in theatre and gender studies, the students want to stand together as a community and support Native Americans all over the country.
“This is more of a display of solidarity than a protest,” Delgado said. “We are a part of this movement because so many of us go through our daily life without thinking of the true minorities of America, be that a social or cultural minority. We are bringing a national argument and a national discourse to USC.”
Henry Mattei, a junior majoring in environmental studies and economics, said that he came to the protest because of his involvement as an organizing director for the Bernie Sanders campaign, an experience Mattei said opened his eyes to the issue of corporate money in politics. 
“I have been an environmentalist ever since I was a small kid, and for me, when we value our environment and the planet, we have to value our people,” Mattei said. “I realized that we really have to address that issue seriously. It is important to listen to people who have been standing for these rights and speaking out on these issues for a long time.”

Alexandra Ting | Daily TrojanGet political · Panelists spoke on topics students said they wanted to discuss, from immigration to college tuition.
Students, faculty and guest speakers gathered to discuss immigration and college affordability at Doheny Memorial Library on Thursday evening. The event, titled “Issues Facing Millennials: Listen, Talk, #JustVote,” was sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics in partnership with ProCon, Participant Media, USC College Democrats and USC College Republicans.
The panel consisted of campaign for Free College Tuition President Morley Winograd, California Community Foundation Program Officer Rosie Arroyo, The Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities President Kristen Soares, California College Republicans Chief of Staff Robert Petrosian, USC College Democrats member Jeremy Salley and USC College Republicans President Tiffany Hoss.
Unlike prior Unruh Institute events, this panel’s design was based on a survey asking USC students about the issues that matter most to them in the upcoming presidential election. The two most popular issues were pathways to citizenship and student debt. 
The event began with a discussion about the importance of the millennial vote. Moderator Dan Schnur, the director of the Unruh Institute, said that he is often asked whether one vote is going to make a difference. In response, he compared the concept of voting to recycling, in that one person may not singlehandedly save the planet by separating paper from plastic, but that together a large number of people can make change.
“It’s the same concept with voting,” Schnur said. “It’s important to know that your vote really does matter, particularly on those issues that are important to you.”
The conversation then shifted from voting to college tuition, specifically regarding free tuition at public universities.
“Hypothetically speaking, if every student in California were allowed to go to a public university like UCLA for free, it would most likely disenfranchise minority students,” Salley said. “That’s because of admissions. Instead of 100,000 students competing for spots, you’d have 300,000 students competing.”
Hoss agreed that student loans are an issue, but said that there are alternatives to free tuition at public universities. Hoss said that universities are spending money on things that are not associated with academic progress, like drivers and athletic programs, which leads to higher tuition prices.
“It’s important to get major transparency on where the money is going to so we can lower student debt,” Hoss said. “We could create work-study programs for students. If they commit to working for the government for two years, then the government should subsidize their tuition.”
The final topics covered were immigration and a pathway to citizenship. Arroyo said that although undocumented immigrants face challenges in the current U.S. climate, she is hopeful that the situation will improve in the future. 
“Our country is at an inflection point,” Arroyo said. “I think reform is going to happen but it’s just a matter of time, as there’s a lot of stake in the upcoming election. But California has made progress by embracing a pro-immigrant agenda and giving undocumented immigrants a driver’s license.” 
Petronian, however, explained his hesitation to guarantee a national pathway to citizenship, and instead proposed that the changes start state by state.
“Immigration reform hits some parts of the country a lot harder than others,” Petrosian said. “In California, there is far greater catering towards the interests of undocumented individuals, whereas in some other parts of the country, a lot of people might not have seen an immigrant in their life. Because of that disparity, there’s not enough unity in Congress for there to be a solution that will satisfy everybody.” 
The USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics holds events every week as part of its Road to the White House series. Next Tuesday, the Institute will register voters by Tommy Trojan from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Kyleen Hengelhaupt | Daily TrojanStanding tall · Junior outside hitter Niki Withers had 13 kills in USC’s loss on Wednesday. The Women of Troy face Washington on Friday.
After a tough loss to UCLA on Wednesday, the Women of Troy (8-4) look for redemption in Friday’s game against Washington (10-1). The Trojans lost to the Bruins in four sets, ending their 8-match winning streak. This weekend, they look to defeat Washington and continue working on their team communication. 
Though Wednesday’s match was a letdown for Trojan fans, various players stepped up to help the team. For example, junior middle blocker Jordan Dunn recorded six kills and put up four blocks against the Bruins. Junior outside hitter Niki Withers had 13 kills, while sophomore libero Victoria Garrick had a career high 24 digs during the game. The Trojans believe that they can bounce back for Friday’s game. 
“My focus has to be all the good things we did tonight and how much better we improved in some things,” head coach Mick Haley said. “This gave us a really good look at where we can improve to get better.”
Friday will be a quick turnaround for the Trojans, especially since no one likes losing to the Bruins. However, Washington will be a good game for the Trojans to work on correcting their mistakes. Because the games are so close together, Haley said they won’t be able to get much better or improve too much in the one day they have between games. 
“We have to gut this Friday match out,” Haley said. “We are not going to get better or improve, but we certainly are gonna have some experiences from this that are gonna help us a little bit.”
For Friday, both Haley and junior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley believe there are little things they can tweak to improve their game. The team primarily needs to emphasize communication and ball control in order to be successful this weekend. Haley said that because the team is so young, there are still small errors that they make which can be fixed with concentration and experience.
“We have to focus on strategies and correcting some leaks in our reception patterns, working on whose ball is whose,” Haley said. “We have to emphasize ball control. We must have lost 5 or 7 points on just not handling the ball well. That is something we can correct with concentration and passing.”
Meyer-Whalley echoed this sentiment, saying that when the ball is on their side of the court, the team needs to work on both controlling the ball and bettering the ball. She also explained that there must be a rhythm between the setters and the hitters, and once that comes, the team will be hitting a lot more balls. They have to work on trusting each other as well. 
“We can’t start a match with ease, you have to go in fighting,” Meyer-Whalley said. “Our body language has to be that we are ready to fight from the beginning. We have to build some momentum, because it takes momentum away from the other team.” 
The Women of Troy will face the University of Washington Friday night at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.

We are just four weeks into the season, and yet, after plenty of hair-pulling frustration, lackluster primetime losses and inexplicable coaching decisions, it might be time to beg the question: Does the USC football program have a plan?
It’s one thing to lose games as the underdog to top-ranked Alabama and seventh-ranked Stanford, but it’s another to score just 1 touchdown between the two games, let the Crimson Tide drop 52 points on opening night and by Week 3, have more than one player admit that at halftime against Stanford, some of their teammates had already given up. 
The game plan put forth by Clay Helton and his staff has been uninspiring and, at times, questionable. On a team laced with talent up and down the roster and a bevy of top recruits in the pipeline, it’s depressing to see just how little of its potential USC has shown. 
No example is clearer than junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. One of the most skilled receivers in college football, Smith-Schuster had a grand total of four catches against Alabama and Stanford. Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne barely looked his way — whether it was because of the play call or defenses clamping down — and USC’s best offensive weapon has been essentially rendered useless in two out of three games.
“I’ve been discredited before by only throwing to one guy, and now you have the ball spread around to different guys,” Helton said after the Stanford game before praising wide receivers redshirt junior Steven Mitchell Jr. and senior Darreus Rogers. “You can never be right. You either throw it to one guy or throw it to the guy that’s open.”
Helton is right that Mitchell and Rogers are playing well — they are tied for the team lead in catches with 13. But when such a dangerous force in Smith-Schuster is not even remotely involved in a majority of the offensive plays, that’s a problem.
Through two games, Smith-Schuster has been targeted 19.4 percent of the time — good enough for second amongst USC receivers but still down from 30.8 percent last season. In comparison, Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey — who torched USC again last Saturday — has just one fewer catches than Smith-Schuster who has 11 and McCaffrey been targeted as a receiver 36.4 percent of the time. Keep in mind that McCaffrey is listed as a running back.
That is one of the main differences between USC and Stanford that became apparent last week. Stanford knows exactly how to use its best player, as it seems like McCaffrey either has the ball in his hands or serves as an effective decoy — in the third quarter, the Trojans completely bit on a reverse handoff that was faked to McCaffrey and ended up in the hands of Michael Rector, who scored a 56-yard touchdown on the end-around that put the game away. Even when McCaffrey isn’t directly involved, he’s still making an impact; USC can’t even get Smith-Schuster involved — period.
Part of the blame falls on players’ execution, on the quarterback not making his reads and the receiver not finding openings. But it is hard to believe how a team with this much talent doesn’t even come close to showcasing it on the field — and that blame lies with the coaches.
Right now, Helton gives off the vibe that he is in over his head at USC. He is 1-4 to start his full-time head coaching career, with the one win coming against Utah State. He named Browne his starting quarterback before the season, said it was his hope Browne would keep the job for “seasons,” but wound up replacing him with a redshirt freshman just three games in. He said before camp that junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson would focus explicitly on defense, but now is “definitely” considering putting Jackson back on offense. Against Stanford, he opted to punt trailing by 17 in the fourth quarter from the Cardinal’s 44-yard line, a decision he defended by saying he wanted to “pin them deep” (hey, at least they did!). He also saw a “giant leap forward” in his team’s competitiveness level, which, if true, should cause alarm considering the way USC performed.
Helton’s decision to replace Browne with Sam Darnold — and, to a lesser extent, putting Jackson back in at wide receiver — reeks of desperation. While the quarterback switch could end up being the right move, it seems to have been made in the spur of the moment, with Helton realizing that this season could be unexpectedly horrendous and playing perhaps his biggest card in changing quarterbacks.
This way, if Darnold leads the Trojans to a loss in Utah, the narrative will go that he was a redshirt freshman making his first career start and just getting adapted to the spotlight. Then, USC has the “easy” stretch of its gruesome schedule, with four of its next five games coming at home and the one road game against Arizona. If Darnold doesn’t break in against Utah, he absolutely should by the time November rolls around.
Not having a quarterback controversy three months into the season is best-case scenario for the Trojans in a campaign that has turned sour far earlier than expected, and that has to be disappointing for a program expected to contend for a Pac-12 Championship.
It can all be attributed to not having a gameplan either on or off the field. When your former athletic director signs an unproven career assistant to a five-year contract to become the head coach, but then bolts for retirement months later and leaves a mess for his successor, was that really the plan? When the new coach’s first major decision — choosing a new quarterback — backfires faster than you can learn to pronounce Stevie Tu’ikolovatu’s last name and you have a redshirt freshman starting on the road, against a ranked opponent, in a conference game and in slick conditions by Week 4, is this really the plan?
USC may still be a recognizable brand name, but right now the Trojans are looking more like students winging a midterm they didn’t study for than the professors that they were in a previous life.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanHomeward bound · Sophomore defensive end Porter Gustin is one of two players traveling to his home state of Utah for Friday night’s game. Gustin is joined by his fellow defensive lineman, graduate transfer Stevie Tu’ikolovatu.
Coming off of yet another disappointing loss, the Trojans (1-2) are traveling to Salt Lake City after a short week to face the No. 24 Utah Utes (3-0). The game is the second consecutive road tilt for the Trojans and their third game away from the Coliseum of the season in four weeks.
The game against Utah will be the first start of the season for redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, who was named the new starter on Monday.
“I’m just going to do my best with the opportunity given and hopefully we get a W,” Darnold said.
The San Clemente native has appeared in all three of the Trojans’ games so far and is 14-22 with 136 yards, 2 touchdowns and one interception. Head coach Clay Helton said that he sees Darnold as an every down quarterback.
“I want to see a spark in our offense, and I hope that Sam can bring that,” Helton said. “I’m confident in it after three games of watching him perform.”
For an offense that ranks last in the Pac-12, Darnold will need the offensive line to help him get the offense on the right track. The offensive line had five false starts in the first half of the Stanford game alone, and penalties have proven to be one of the problems the team needs to curb in order to win on Friday night. 
Utah senior defensive end Hunter Dimick is the conference leader in sacks, with three so far on the season, and the Utes are the conference leader and second in the nation in sacks as a team — having tallied 15 this season. Ten players have recorded a sack, and the Utes recorded 10 sacks as a team in last week’s game against Utah State.
In addition to facing the challenge of a stout defensive line, the Trojans are also up against the elements. With rain on the forecast, USC prepared this week by running drills with wet balls. The team has also prepared for the typically hostile environment at Rice-Eccles Stadium by using simulated crowd noise at practice.
The Trojan defense will likely get in trouble if the offense cannot help them stay off of the field. USC has a challenge ahead of it facing another dual-threat quarterback, in freshman Jalen Hurts of Alabama and junior Kent Myers of Utah State. 
“He’s very athletic so we’ve got to contain him, make sure he doesn’t run,” sophomore defensive end Porter Gustin said. “They’ve got a pretty solid O-line, I think. So just get off blocks, set edges, be quick on the pass rush and play physical.”
Gustin is one of two players from Utah and he said he is excited about playing in cooler weather and in front of friends and family. The other Utah native is graduate transfer defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu, who is also looking forward to return and play against his former school.
“I remember beating USC, saying how much I hated these guys, but now I love them to death,” Tu’ikolovatu said. “[I’m] telling everybody how the other offensive lineman plays, what’s his weaknesses, so we can try to capitalize on that.”
The last time the teams met in Salt Lake City was in 2014, where the Utes snuck past the Trojans with a 24-21 win. Friday will be a “blackout” game, meaning the crowd will be completely dressed in black, and the atmosphere will be the same as it was in 2014, another blackout game.
The matchup is televised on Fox Sports 1 at 6 p.m. PT.

People think my Australian accent is cool, but I think people with accents from Texas are way hotter.
 There is one Southern Belle who will forever plague this love columnist’s soul. I call her the green-eyed monster.
 I met this G.E.M. (green-eyed monster) at a church in Houston. last year. As she hurried in late to the church service, she walked up to me and asked me if the seat next to me was taken. “Giiiirl,” I thought, “this seat is most definitely not taken. How about you? Are you?” 
Now, why is she a green-eyed monster? Well. Her eyes had this enchanting spell around them that made you feel like you were in love. I felt like I was being seen for the first time. This G.E.M. was an aromatic linguini pasta drizzled in beautiful, green pesto sauce. She had the most beautiful, deep green eyes that complemented her lightning blonde hair, and she had an illustrious shine to her personality that made her a most-prized treasure.
 I somehow bamboozled my way into hanging out with her for the rest of that day. By the end of the day, I kid you not, I wasn’t even that into how hot she was, but I was way more attracted to her personality. I’m sure I’ll get many eyerolls for this, but I’m dead serious. She had this confidence and inner alignment within herself that was out of this world. Simply said, I was infatuated. 
 But as history has played out for this ironically single-as-the-last-Pringle love columnist, all good things must come to an end. But hey, at least it makes for fun love articles, am I right?
 So I slid in the question. “Green-eyed monster, are you seeing anyone right now?”
 To my surprise, the 19-year-old had just been proposed to and was now engaged. Hearing this from this G.E.M. definitely felt like that scene in Superman vs. Batman where Batman unveils his Kryptonite. I was weak.
 Now friends, quick timeout. I was not weak because I felt entitled as a man to her affection. I was not weak because I felt like I had been “friend zoned” and was only talking to her so I could ‘get it’ as some childish people feel. I was weak because there was something about the way she carried herself that was so damn magnetic. Um, of course it doesn’t hurt that she was hot, but I have met many who others I would call physically attractive who are super inwardly repulsive.
 But the girl had a freakin’ fiancé. What?! Why does this always happen?! So many of the women I find myself attracted to are in relationships.
 And one more timeout (I don’t sport, is it even allowed to have two of them in the same game?). This is not the “Oh, you want what you can’t have” problem. I didn’t even know these women were in relationships.
 And it’s also not because all of the single people out there are not good enough for attraction and all the demanded ones are taken or not available. You see, I have seen marked shifts in the way the same people hold themselves when they are out of relationships. And these are huge generalizations I know, but within the bell-curve of intuitive qualitative pattern recognition us NF’s on the MBTI are cursed with — I mean, gifted — I find an interesting observation that all can benefit from: people who try to attract others by denying themselves are not that attractive.
 I think this makes so much sense. People already in relationships and people who don’t feel like they need someone else are more comfortable being themselves. And that is so much more magnetic than the tumbleweed following wherever the wind goes.
 Picture a person being told, “I hate rap music.” A person who is too accommodating and wanting to please others will probably respond, “well, I guess there are some songs in the genre I don’t really like all the time. But a person who is centered on who they are is quick to reply, “Woah. You are so wrong for feeling that way. Let me show you some epic tunes.”
 Which do you think would be more attractive, all held equal?
 So friends, when you are out there on the prowl and you got a boo in your sights, rather than try to be who you think they want you to be, find your specific edge and shout it freakin’ loud. Find your center and don’t try to fit the mold because you’ll end up being a boring and unattractive individual. Trust me. And before you know it, who knows, maybe you’ll have people calling you their [insert color here]-eyed monster.
 This is pretty obvious. But it’s not observed. We all know this to be true deep down, but we don’t do it. So let’s do it.
 UPDATE: G.E.M. is no longer engaged. Yo boy ready to slide into them DMs after an appropriate amount of time. Till next-next week, friends. Bye!

Photo courtesy of Azla VeganAlmost Addis Ababa · Azla Vegan offers a variety of traditional recipes and allows L.A. residents to explore Ethiopian culture. They have recently partnered with hip-hop artist Ras G of Brainfeeder records.
Located in the Mercado de Paloma, the Azla Vegan Ethiopian restaurant stands out in the renowned South L.A. food center by engaging the neighborhood in Ethiopian culture through customary recipes and handcrafted beats. Among the persevering entrepreneurs and cultural pioneers in the marketplace, owner Azla and daughter and co-owner Nesanet adhere to a health-conscious lifestyle through their vegan options and adhere to showcasing their culture through entertainment mediums such as music.
 L.A.-based hip-hop producer Ras G, who is signed with Brainfeeder records, helped the family-owned restaurant earlier this month to immerse their customers with their African roots by creating the first out of a special series of mixtapes “that highlight the tradition, culture and diaspora of Ethiopia,” according to L.A. Taco. Azla Sounds Volume 1, available in limited edition cassette and digital album format, consists of 13 flavorful tracks that give customers insight into authentic Ethiopian sounds, but with a jazzy, inner-city twist to adapt to its South Central setting.
 Each track on the Bandcamp digital album is named after its ordered number in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia. The music collection alternates between short, jazzy snippets like the first song “And” and choppy, electronic tones like the third song “Sost.”
 Aside from the music partnership that the restaurant has made, Azla allows customers indulge themselves in authentic Ethiopian cuisine, consisting of the foods such as injera, a traditional spongy pancake-like bread, spicy stew and other vegan entrees. Brown rice can act as a substitute for the injera to complement the main dishes people can choose from, including different wots made of red lentils, yellow split peas, baked tofu and various vegan ingredients. Salads are also offered as options for the main course, which complement the refreshing drinks available such as kale lemonade, kombucha and sorrel, an iced tea made of hibiscus flowers, ginger and cinnamon.
 These individually plated meals contrast the traditional large platter group settings of the Little Ethiopia eateries, one of L.A.’s popular ethnic districts on South Fairfax Avenue. While it is the first Ethiopian restaurant in South L.A., Azla Vegan appeals to Ethiopians and non-Ethiopians alike by supporting a personalized cultural immersion within a culturally accepting city.
 As veganism has come into the forefront of the city’s fitness craze, Ethiopian culture has embraced the no-meat, no-dairy diet as one of its long-standing religious traditions. The Orthodox Christian custom requires its supplicants to abstain from eating animal products over its various fasting periods, including the Nativity, Lent and almost every Wednesday and Friday. By spending more than half of the year adhering to a strict vegan diet, Azla Vegan engages in an older tradition in which Los Angeles’ Ethiopian population can indulge in and a newer trend that the city’s general population can conform to.
 While looking at veganism through a new-fashioned lens, traditional Ethiopian music has been modified for this cutting-edge restaurant, whose mission as stated in the Bandcamp biography is “serving mama Azla’s love-infused Ethiopian food … [and] sharing the rich artistic traditions of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian diaspora with the world.”
 With its hip-hop and trendy fusion vibes, Azla Vegan affirms the melting pot dynamic of the Mercado de Paloma, while cooking up various flavors and beats for customers.

Photo courtesy of Sprinkles CupcakesTreat yo self · Los Angeles will host its event, Dessert Week, an all day festival that features the top 25 desserts in the city. There will be attractions such as a wine garden, live music, and a pie eating contest.
From Oct. 9 to 15, downtown L.A. will be enlivened with sugar, spice and all things nice. For the first time ever, Los Angeles is hosting its very own Dessert Week. Twenty-five selected vendors will be providing special offers and discounts throughout the week. Vendors include large chains, as well as quintessential L.A. establishments like Saffron and Rose, Diddy Riese and Randy’s Donuts. 
Dessert Week was founded by Daniel Amitin, with the hope to celebrate some of country’s favorite foods. According to USA Today, 40 percent of Americans ate dessert after meals at least twice a week in 2013, a 4 percent increase from three years prior. 
However, this may be due to the increased popularity of non-traditional sweet shops. Snacks and items such as bubble tea, acai bowls and frozen yogurt have redefined the way millennials consume desserts. They may not be eating traditional pastries but they still have the same sweet tooth. Dessert Week brings back traditions of ice cream, cookies, and cake, with a special Californian twist.
At first glance, dessert doesn’t seem like a large part of the Los Angeles food scene. Los Angeles has been recognized (and mocked) for its kale-loving, juice squeezed and health conscious nature. Yet it is also home to a wide array of traditional dessert establishments. For example, Doughboys Cafe and Bakery was on Fodor’s “America’s 20 Best Dessert Spots” list and Sprinkles Cupcakes had its beginnings in Beverly Hills. Dessert Week hopes to highlight such gems that are sometimes forgotten amongst the whirlwind of Whole Foods and acai. 
One of the vendors, Saffron and Rose, is a Persian bakery located in Little Tehran. This parlor was originally a small, mom and pop ice cream parlor, founded by Kashani-Rafye, an Iranian immigrant, in 1974. Saffron and Rose has now evolved to becomes one of the largest producers of Persian ice cream in the country. Carrying on the tradition of hospitality that the parlor was founded on, his family forges individual connections with his customers, and maintain the blend of Persian and American traditions. In contrast, since its start in 2005, the popular chain, Sprinkles Cupcakes has established its name, with more than 20 locations across the country. The quintessential cupcakery, The Washington Post says “most cupcake bakeries take their inspiration from Sprinkles.” Dessert Week provides participants with a wide array of different locations, sizes and types of dessert restaurants. They aim to please customers with a variety of different tastes and preferences.
Many of the top 25 selected vendors are in close proximity to USC Campus. Cream is practically on campus, located next to the University Gateway Apartments. CoolHaus in Culver City is easily accessible by the Metro Expo Line. The Pie Hole, Ice Cream Lab and Gelateria Uli are all within five miles of campus, and are in close proximity of each other. Use the hashtag #DessertLA or #UDessertThis, for a chance to be featured on the Dessert LA site. 
Dessert Week will culminate with a fair in Pershing Square on Oct. 15, where all the selected vendors will come together to celebrate all things sweet. A limited number of tickets are available, $15 general admission and $25, for VIP. Otherwise, grab a few friends, order an uber and have own dessert tour of L.A.

A new California law requiring students to be up-to-date on vaccinations before enrolling in public schools was put into place July 1, and this school year is the first to witness its implementation. This need for children who attend public school to be vaccinated is an example of the state interceding in local authority for the sake of the greater good of the public. In the delegation of authority within a state with regard to education, local school districts continuously adapt to reflect current issues within the district, while the state acts as a constitutional authority on education through the creation of laws and regulations.  Legislation like the No Child Left Behind Act, and more recently, Common Core, has given the federal government increasing power over education. Thus, what is the relationship between the state and federal government in the authority over educational issues?
In the 1973 Supreme Court case San Antonio Independent School District v Rodriguez, the Court held that there was no fundamental right to education in the Constitution; thus, as demonstrated in cases like Brown v Board of Education and others, states cannot have discriminatory schooling practices, but plaintiffs are limited in their ability to appeal to the federal government for how those systems of education within the states are arranged otherwise. 
The constitutionally delegated authority for states to have power over education resides in each state’s constitution. California, for example, explicitly states that  a common system of school must exist, and has specific constitutional requirements pertaining to the funding of schools, religious instruction and establishment of higher education. Given that the constitutional authority over education resides in each individual state, and the negative consequences over accountability measures utilized by the federal government in order for schools to receive federal funding, education is best left to be handled and decided on by the states. 
Federal policies often link accountability measures to funding sources to ensure that schools are held responsible and that the funding they are given is used for a particular goal. For example, No Child Left Behind, a piece of federal legislation enacted into law in 2002, links standardized test performance to sanctions for public schools that fail to make adequate yearly progress by each subgroup of students based on special needs, minority status, English language proficiency and socioeconomic status. NCLB helped spurn the movement in education toward high stakes accountability testing as a means to make sure schools, and furthermore states, were teaching students what they needed to learn. The belief was that if the federal government tested students and held educators accountable for improving test scores, students’ scores would increase. However, students have barely shown any increase in scores when comparing test scores pre and post NCLB implementation. Yet, both the Bush and Obama administrations have offered federal grants through Race to the Top, Flexibility Waivers under NCLB, School Improvement Grants and various other programs to push states, districts and schools to line up behind policies that use these same test scores in high-stakes evaluations of teachers and principals. These tests are larger indicators of educational opportunity gaps that exist between races and social classes, which can only effectively be remediated at the state level as well. These accountability measures have been unable to effectively demonstrate how they have successfully raised student academic achievement, which was the goal of their implementation in the first place. 
Proponents of federal control education point out examples from international countries that have exemplary systems of education thanks to federal control. Countries like Finland, which is consistently ranked as the top nation in the world for education, do boast a heavy federal government presence in schools. However, it is important to note that the success of these other countries are much more heavily related to their distribution of funding, wealth equity, social programs and teacher education programs than the role of the state or federal government in education.
Ultimately, states have the right to set their own learning goals and standards for what they want their students to learn in schools. Furthermore, when the state and local school districts have more authority over education, constituents are better able to vote elected officials out of office if they feel like the official is not appropriately solving educational issues within the state or district. By maintaining local control over education, communities have more of a chance to have a larger impact on schooling, and address their individual students’ unique needs better than the federal government would be able to.

At the Daily Trojan, we pride ourselves on our commitment to constant, unbiased coverage of the University of Southern California. Serving as an independent publication since 1912, it is a privilege and an honor to report on the many facets of the University without being pressured into censorship or dismissal by campus organizations or administration.
What worries us, then, is when these values are violated.
Earlier this week, one of our reporters was invited by the Interfraternity Council to cover the organization’s sexual assault prevention and Title IX training for their 400-plus new members. It was an event they were seemingly proud to showcase, and our reporter gladly accepted the invitation. Instances of sexual assault continue to plague our University, and we’d be glad to report on any outreach to prevent this.
By the end of the training, however, our warm welcome quickly soured. As our reporter prepared to leave the event, she was stopped by two IFC representatives and told she could not exit until she deleted her recording of the event. This was “private,” they said. Our reporter, startled and confused, complied after the members made it clear that she would not be let go unless her recording was erased. The director of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development then advised her to send her coverage of the event to an IFC board member for review before publication.
This, of course, we found extremely unsettling.
The Daily Trojan, as any other independent journalistic entity, does not comply with requests of article approval prior to publication, otherwise known as prior restraint. It is a tenet of the First Amendment and a pillar of American freedom of the press. To verify facts and quotes with the source is one thing, but to request final say of the piece is the antithesis of the journalist’s mission to report fair and accurately. 
Nor does the IFC, or any other organization for that matter, have the right to force one of our reporters to delete their recording. This cry of “privacy” was never told beforehand, and the hosts were well aware the Daily Trojan was present.
We understand the topic of sexual assault is sensitive. But when an organization invites a reporter to the event with no disclosure that the event is private or off-the-record, there is no justification for demanding the deletion of their recording. If nothing else, the tape is mutually beneficial for both parties so there are no discrepancies between what the reporter writes and what actually happens at the event. 
This behavior, then, begs the question of what is there to hide? Why such cautionary measures after the fact for coverage of an event that, if anything, makes the organization appear progressive and proactive?
We have some thoughts. While at the event, our reporter noticed behavior she found rather unbecoming from both the audience and administration considering the sensitive nature of the topics discussed. 
Before the event began, she heard murmurs in line that this event was a “waste of time” and “bullsh-t.” And after the training commenced, behavior worsened. 
Proddings for participation from administration were often met with apathy. When some did participate, the men in the audience seemed concerned about mixed signals from women during sexual encounters. One man commented that women can be  “teases” and “sometimes I’ll take off a girl’s bra but then she’ll cover her breasts.” What was even more unsettling was administrators in turn would often describe these situations as “tricky” and  “gray areas.” 
Under California law concerning consent, there is no room for confusion. Green means go. Red means stop. Yes means yes. 
In another instance, a fraternity member said it was a “mental assault” for him when a girl backed out of a hook up at the last minute. The audience laughed. Again, the word “tricky” was used in response. 
We want to believe that this was just an instance of a “few bad apples.” These are, after all, new members perhaps eager to impress fellow brothers with feigned apathy. To say that the majority of fraternity members reflect this same behavior would be grossly unfair. But the actions of those in the audience and the behavior of Greek leaders toward our newspaper is anything but becoming of a student organization that prides itself on leadership and being “one of USC’s proudest traditions.”
If IFC is truly serious about reforming sexual assault culture at USC, we will serve as a willing platform to report these important efforts. But if its members choose to shut us out and merely pay lip service to an issue that will victimize 30 percent of women on the USC campus, then they must know that we will be present for that as well.

Shruthi Hiriyuru | Daily Trojan
In the weeks leading up to my flight across the Atlantic to study abroad in America, I realized that my decision had raised many eyebrows. I had a well-paying job, and like my friends often liked to point out, my personal life was all settled. The reasons were many, but the strongest of them dawned on me only after I had completed the first leg of my journey.
My flatmates-to-be and I had planned the journey well in advance. I was looking forward to spending the long flight hours bonding with them and becoming friends before we even set foot in our shared apartment. It was the perfect plan. Except, it all went downhill from the moment we landed in Dubai. Being stranded at that airport for almost a day (as an aftermath to a nasty flight accident the day before), with less than two hours of sleep in more than a day and just a bunch of muffins to keep my sugar levels from plummeting, I realized that I had done something that had been so unimaginable for me just a week ago. I had been apprehensive — my mind clouded with the fear of not having what it took to go through with the plan. Yet, here I was, and my body and mind had naturally coped. That’s when I realized that familiarity not only bred contempt, but it also fed complacency. I had to get out of my comfort zone and take a leap of faith to discover I could do much better than I thought I could.
Deciding to go to grad school wasn’t for a fancy degree; I was seeking new experiences to humble me and snap me out of the dull bullpucky of life. And it has been one hell of an adventure so far. From ending up in L.A. with no bags (Yes, you read that right! Emirates took more than a week to get their act together), finding help from friends, friends of friends, friends of relatives and practically everyone with a good heart, to getting locked out of the apartment on an ill-fated night, it has been quite eventful. From discussing French movies aboard the Paris flight with a French woman with a Math Ph.D., to conversing in Hindi — a regional Indian language — with a Native American DPS officer in L.A., I have had more meaningful conversations in the last few weeks than I can recall in a long time.
It’s been over a month since I started college now, but there are still a few things that I haven’t quite gotten a hang of. I still can’t wrap my head around the American clothing sizes, fiddle with miles to kilometer conversions in my head, and still get hopelessly lost inside the huge USC campus ‘cause, well, I’m a bit directionally challenged! Before I got here, most of my friends told me that California sun is everything fun, but since landing here, I’ve found the weather to be pretty weird. During the day, the sun is so harsh you can’t think of stepping out without sunscreen and a cap or sunglasses. Come evenings, it is suddenly too cold and windy. I need to carry around both my sunglasses and jacket all the time!
Despite all of that, I’m in awe of student life here. It’s so cool to see students zooming in and out of campus in all types of skateboards and scooters imaginable! Every nook and corner of the campus radiates beauty. Every fountain with its own charm never fails to enthrall me. Every building with its own unique architecture has a story to tell — and I want to know them all! But with the start of classes, piled up assignments and the mad pressure to chalk out a career path, I am afraid I might not be able to do that. Yet, no matter how nerve-racking it might seem, I am excited to be a part of this story and to see how it all unfolds.
This story ended too abruptly.  I want more.  You are a great storyteller, that’s for sure.  Good luck with your studies and Fight On!
Hey GeorgeCurious,
Thank you for the wishes. Watch this column for more stories. I promise I’ll try making them more elaborate going forward! :)
Well written :) You nailed it ! Expecting your next post soon.
Thank you so much Janani :)

For the last few weeks, the dialogue surrounding race and social justice in the United States has been reduced to a single question, framed as a black-and-white (or maybe a black-vs-white) issue: do you support Colin Kaepernick and his decision to kneel during the Star Spangled Banner, or is ‘disrespecting’ the American flag a hostile act of treason? When complex ideas are sliced into 140-character one-liners, nuance is often the first casualty. This is debate in 2016 — largely unproductive, ill-informed, often times rude. Still, Kaepernick has achieved remarkable success in starting a national conversation, perhaps sparking even more outrage than the filmed police murders of two black men.
It is because of Kaepernick’s celebrity that the media has exploded with his story. But while he may be the most recognizable, he’s not the only afro-sporting black man fighting for change in our country. One such activist, blessed with extravagant nappiness, is USC’s Jody David Armour.

Jody is the Roy P. Crocker Professor at the Gould School of Law. A 20-year faculty member, he regularly teaches torts and criminal law. I was recently invited to Armour’s home to observe his law-school seminar, ‘Race, Stereotypes and the Rule of Law.’      
The door was open when I arrived, and my knock was greeted by a booming invitation to “come on in!” Jody was tidying up around the house, gliding from room to room, busy but not harried. He showed me out to his backyard, and returned to his preparations.
The house sits atop a hill in View Park. When incorporated with Baldwin Hills, Windsor Hills and Ladera Heights, this neighborhood makes up the “largest contiguous middle to upper-middle class black area in the nation,” Professor Armour said. Some call it the Black Beverly Hills, and perched on its peak is Jody’s home.
From the backyard, I could see the entire L.A. Basin, complete with an unobstructed view of downtown, and a sharp glare from the setting sun reflecting off smog.  There are a couple tables on the patio area, and a pool. It looks perfect for a family BBQ; I would almost call it *gasp* suburban.
That was my first impression. It was quickly corrected when I noticed the three dinosaur sculptures, each in a different corner of the yard. You know the giant dinosaurs out in Palm Springs, the ones in the Pee Wee Herman movie? They look like those, only on a smaller scale. No backyard can be suburban when it’s home to a T-Rex, Velociraptor, and Triceratops.

I got the chance to look around the living room while waiting for the seminar to begin. Jody’s personality is reflected in the decor — an eclectic arrangement of art, architecture, and design —  a collection that both highlights and shatters stereotypes. Yellow and green walls are lined with paintings of athletes and musicians, portraits of influential black figures. Sitting in front of his stone fireplace is a collection of trophies; accolades earned in various sports by his three sons. On the coffee table, next to a model skull of a saber-toothed tiger, is an assortment of mugs, bottles of lemonade, cranberry juice, and a box of Triscuits — drinks and snacks for the upcoming discussion.
The small row of books on display in his living room showcases Professor Armour’s intellectual pursuits. Among the dozen or so titles: Philosophical Investigations (Jody tells me that the author, Ludwig Wittgenstein, is “the lawyer’s philosopher, par excellence”); Ideals, Beliefs, Attitudes & The Law; Racial Paranoia; Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

This is the house of an academic, an artist, a lawyer, a philosopher, a black man.
While observing the seminar, I was struck by Jody’s laid-back style of teaching. He sits in a black armchair, feet kicked up on the table — he would be slouching, if he weren’t so tall. 
Half of the class meeting was spent on introductions — every student shared their name, year (all 2Ls and 3Ls), and hometown; what normally seems like a colossal waste of time was turned into 20 different teaching opportunities by Professor Armour. “Oh, you’re from Chillicothe, Ohio? Hold on, here’s what’s deep about that, I visited my dad in prison in Chillicothe, Ohio.”
Jody attributes much of his interest in the law to his father’s incarceration for the possession and sale of marijuana — 22 to 55 years. While incarcerated, Fred Armour learned the law “from the warden’s own books” and eventually won the case ‘Armour v. Salisbury,’ which Jody now teaches in his criminal law class. He is intimately familiar with the effects of mass incarceration, as both the son of a ‘criminal,’ and a legal scholar. 
Jody’s upcoming work, N***a Theory (seen in part here), forms at the intersection of his personal life experience and his years as an academic, professor, and public intellectual. N***a Theory is a response to those who embrace a politics of respectability, people like Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and comedian Chris Rock.
Those who espouse a politics of respectability hold that ‘well-to-do’ black people should disassociate themselves from black criminals, thus protecting the reputation of the ‘good black people’ while denigrating and other-izing, or, as put by Professor Armour, “niggerizing,” ‘bad black people.’ They create, to quote Armour’s work, a “litmus test” for the stark definition of ‘good negroes,’ and ‘bad negroes,’ a distinction based solely upon one’s criminal activity.
The politics of respectability says that to be good is to be law-abiding, to be bad is to be a law-breaker. Such a philosophy grants state lawmakers and enforcers the power of moral judgment, creating a mechanism by which one can evaluate a person’s moral worth by their accordance with the law.
Of course, this is a fallacious line of thinking. “Highly disadvantaged people do commit a higher rate of crime [than relatively privileged people], that’s a statistical fact,” Professor Armour said. So it goes something like this — being black in America brings along with it a certain set of structural, systemic disadvantages in socioeconomic status and treatment under the law (disadvantages that can be directly traced to slavery). Being highly disadvantaged leaves one at higher risk for committing crimes, and once someone has committed a crime, we label them ‘bad,’ or ‘n**ga.’ So an entire group is born into a system ready to strip them of moral worth and throw them in prison. And still, we tell Kaepernick to rise.
In the antebellum United States, it was slave-status that marked a black person as unworthy of humane treatment; today, Armour contends, it is a label of criminality that allows people to turn their backs on disadvantaged blacks.
The inspiration for the title of Jody’s work comes from the politics of respectability as presented by Chris Rock in his most famous stand-up routine; he tells the crowd, “I love black people, but I hate niggas!” As one whose chief benefactor has been white privilege, my first question for Jody was one of both substance and necessity — “How should I refer to your work?”
“The n-word,” Professor Armour began, “is no different than any other linguistic or non-linguistic form of communication, its meaning is mutable like the confederate flag, they both have deep roots that run into a racist American past… the difference though is blacks have not appropriated the confederate flag in the way they have appropriated the n-word.”
Because of the linguistic appropriation in the black community, Armour said, the n-word has been “inverted and transvalued [such that] it can be used with irony.” Meaning, as Jody’s favorite philosopher, Wittgenstein, tells us, is use. When the n-word is used by a member of the black community, it is a radical disavowal of what the word has historically meant. When used by someone outside the black community, it retains its status as a “blood-soaked epithet,” and with it the vestiges of slavery and racism, hate and disgust.  
Of course, some have trouble with this perceived monopolization of the n-word: ‘free-speech activists’ and white dudes who don’t like being told what to do (I am a recovering member of this particular faction) make up the preponderance of this group. Jody knows this, and doesn’t presume to tell anyone what they can and can’t say in the privacy of their own homes, or in the car with the radio blasting. But, he says, when you use it, “You [should know] you were running a risk… it’s a word that wounds, and when it does, [don’t] act hurt or surprised or upset and start talking about some double standard.”  
But while this word can only be transvalued by the black community, its presence is ubiquitous in our cultural zeitgeist, particularly in hip-hop culture. It’s utterance is reserved for African-Americans, but everyone hears it. It makes people uncomfortable, and it should — that’s one reason why it’s a staple in rap music, and it’s also part of the reason Professor Armour brings it to academic discussions. In his mind, the n-word, like all words, is a “cultural resource,” and can achieve great effect when used properly.
That is not to imply Jody is callous about his diction — as a lawyer and philosopher, precision of language is one of his daily concerns. When I asked him if he ever felt conflicted about using the n-word, he told me, “You know, I’ll say the n-word, I’ll say nigga, because I’m coming at it from a different position in terms of social stratification, vertical relationships between people, oppression and dominance.”          
There are words that Professor Armour readily admits are not available for his use. In this respect, the n-word is rather analogous to b**ch, an insult historically directed at women. “I am in a privileged gender,” he said. “I am not going to appropriate a word used against members of another gender just because some members of that other gender have decided to adopt the word themselves and put it to [their] own purposes. I’m not gonna say, ‘Just because they use it now I can drop all the b-bombs I want.’ No, it doesn’t work like that, that’s my sense of male entitlement.”
It is clear that much of a word’s meaning is influenced by the identity of its speaker. So how do we know what identity is occupied by whom? For African-American identity, there is no escaping the historical legacy of slavery. “When it comes to blackness in America, you always come back to the auction block,” Professor Armour told me. “That is what makes you black. What makes you black is you could be put on an auction block, and auctioned off as chattel.”    
While this may be the essence of how blackness was formed in America, Professor Armour is keenly aware of the nuance and contingency of social identities. When I told him that my ethnic background is half-caucasian, half-latino, but that I feel disingenuous identifying as anything other than ‘white,’ he commented, “Social identity is not something you’re necessarily born with, but something you perform.” 
Blackness, he elaborates, is not a function of biology, but a complicated intersection of experience, circumstance, self-identification, historical context, and the list goes on. To think of blackness as primarily formed by skin color, for example, is a broad erasure of many seminal black figures in American history. “You aren’t going to go very far in black experience and black history if you start excluding people who have any white blood in them.” Armour points to such luminaries as Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, and President Barack Obama as undeniably black people who are light-skinned and biracial. 
There is, of course, a phenotypical association of dark-skin with blackness, and therefore an association with dark-skin as a marker of moral depravity, if seen through the lens of respectability politics that Armour seeks to shatter. And this association is not only confined to socioeconomically disadvantaged blacks, but attached to any who appear to fit a certain mold. “Because they are conspicuously black, let’s say, discernibly black in terms of social phenotypes and stereotypes about phenotypes,” Jody said, “[black people] have to deal with discrimination on the basis of their black appearance. That’s where racial profiling kicks in.” 
As a black man with a glorious afro, Jody has a wealth of experience when it comes to being profiled. On multiple occasions, his “exuberant nappiness” (great name for a funk band) has resulted in his being perceived as a homeless man, or a criminal. When he first started growing out his hair, he had “students remark that it was ironic that [he teaches] criminal law, and [he looks] like a criminal.” When he was later told by “some downtown attorneys” that his appearance was unprofessional, Jody told me, “I said as a self-conscious matter, that I am going to adopt this hairstyle, this follicle fashion, in defiance of those stereotypes themselves, as if you can’t be a law professor and have an afro.”  
Since donning the afro, Jody has been hassled by guards at JW Marriott who assumed he was a homeless person, and regarded with suspicion by sheriffs at his own front door. “My afro became my hoodie,” Armour said. It’s a hoodie that he can’t remove when he teaches a class, or speaks on a panel — not that he would want to remove it, anyway. 
For Jody, the afro is not solely an act of defiance, a means of showcasing the broad strokes of racial profiling; it is also a “celebration of the African-American soul, pure and simple.” When talking about his hair, I asked if he could elaborate on how he has ‘deliberately caricaturized and cartoonized himself through his appearance.’ This was one of a few times when my own questions were laden with the implicit biases and racial stereotypes that I was asking about — there was my white privilege, assuming that the only reason he wore the afro was to say ‘fuck you’ to the establishment. 
He told me to go check out his twitter profile picture, his senior portrait from high school. “We didn’t consider it a caricature back then in the 60s and 70s,” he said. “Brothers and sisters were rocking fros, there was nothing caricature about it. You know, happy to be nappy kind of mentality.”

Nevertheless, Professor Armour’s donning of the afro today is an inherently political act. “I continue to wear it proudly, like Colin Kaepernick rocks his fro, like a bat signal of solidarity for victims of racial oppression,” he said. 
I told Jody that he would be a great character in a graphic novel — Afrolawyer. 
He chuckled, and, quoting Brooklyn hip-hop group X-Clan, spit a couple lines: 
“‘Walk in the light of the moon but I never been a Batman,
             African call it Blackman.”

Photo courtesy of USC NewsGame on · Tracy Fullerton, the director of the USC Games Program, says her goal is to create a gender-balanced environment in game development.
During her tenure as director of the USC Games Program, Tracy Fullerton has worked to promote an inclusive environment that will attract more diverse students to the program. 
Her efforts seem to have paid off. The Princeton Review recognized USC Games as one of the top game design programs in North America, and in 2014 the program had women outnumber men, redefining the idea that game design is necessarily a male-dominated field.
Last week, Fullerton received Los Angeles magazine’s reader’s choice Woman of the Year award. The Daily Trojan sat down with her to ask about her work with USC Games and her plans for the program.
Daily Trojan: You were recently honored as reader’s choice Woman of the Year by Los Angeles magazine. What does this award mean to you? 
Tracy Fullerton: It means a great deal to me for several reasons. First, as a native of Los Angeles, I grew up looking at the magazine and so to be honored by it now is very meaningful. Second, because I was nominated for this honor by a graduate of the Interactive Media & Games program, a former student, that also makes this even more special. And last, because of the amazing other women honored in this issue. To be named alongside people like Selma director Ava Duvernay, Los Angeles Clippers CEO Gillian Zucker and so many others is actually mind-blowing.
DT: How do you use your position as director of USC Games to encourage women in games? 
TF: As director of USC Games, my job is to create an environment where our entire community of students can learn and grow as designers and developers of innovative entertainment. This means focusing on how teams are built and led, and how we all need to be part of creating an inclusive and diverse environment. It isn’t about encouraging one group or another, it is about creating a space where all individuals feel welcome and are able to do their best work together. We’ve been very successful in creating such an environment here, and so that becomes a positive feedback cycle, attracting more diverse students to the program and to the industry.
DT: Since you became director of USC Games in 2014, have you seen an increase in the number of women in games? 
TF: In 2014 we hit a great milestone in the Interactive Media & Games division in the School of Cinematic Arts — gender balanced incoming classes at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. And since then, we’ve also seen a growing percentage [of women] in the CS Games program in the Viterbi School of Engineering. I see a day not far from now when we’ll have a balanced community across the entire USC Games community, which is a collaboration between these two programs. 
DT: How does having women in the workplace or field positively impact the work environment, and how have you seen this at USC? 
TF: Creating an inclusive community is about individuals learning to work together respectfully and in a way that allows everyone on a team to do the very best work they are capable of doing, and seeing that work build exponentially on the work of others. Everyone wants to work in a positive environment like that, and so learning best practices for creating these high functioning, healthy team environments is attractive to a much wider group of students. Those students, once they graduate and go into the industry, will be able to bring these strong team building and leadership skills to the projects they work on in the industry, as part of a next generation workforce with better, more inclusive work skills.
DT: What is your biggest goal for the future of USC Games? 
TF: Recently, we started the first academic publishing label for games — USC Games Publishing. Also, two years ago, we started our pre-incubator program The Bridge, to help our graduating game development teams start their own companies. We’ve already seen a number of those teams find publishing deals and funding for their projects. And we’ve already published our first game on the USC Games Publishing label. So in addition to the success we’ve had in diversifying the program, I feel like I’ve already accomplished many of my biggest goals for the program. I would like to see the program grow in size, so that we really have the resources to work with all the students coming from other programs across campus who are interested in learning about games and new platforms for interactivity like VR or AR. We’ve got so many people wanting to get involved now, with these technologies, that what I’d really love to see is for us to grow the program and be able to open our doors wide to everyone who wants to learn.
Nice softballs. Nothing about her cancelling, four hours before start, the “Legends of Gaming” panel last April because it didn’t meet her arbitrary agenda? Would be nice to hear some real reporting on this.
Not to mention those heads of the game industry had to clear their calendars to be there, she burned a lot of bridges treating them like that. Who the hell does this woman think she is?
From a comment I read on KotakuInAction
‘I live some 200 feet away from the USC campus.
Last semester I went to the “Game Design Master Program Final Project Showcase”
GUESS HOW MANY PROJECTS QUALIFIED AS GAMES?!
FUCKING ONE.
It was about bards using their music to kill goblins. Required two players that had to keep the beat going with each other as a team. Just a proof of concept but it was actually a lot of fun. Was made by a cool guy in his 30’s I chatted with, super pleasant guy.
The rest were walking simulators, a side scrolling walking simulator with the worst controls ever(Though I admit the art was kinda nice, something about crystals and a princess), that OCTOBO toddler’s toy, a bunch of other nonsensical “interactive experiences”, and some weird ass room where you watched footage of some asian family (not sure what country), set to weird sounds with spliced in footage of bird cages.
This is what “The best and most expensive game design course in the country” has produced. Just the most pathetic thing ever. Other than the bard game the best part of the showcase was free food and a super cool dog someone brought.’

Lena Altaffer | Daily TrojanPeace out · Students engage in quiet meditation at Wednesday’s event, which aimed to connect individual peace with world peace.
Inquiring students and curious passersby gathered to collectively meditate in observance of the United Nations International Day of Peace at Alumni Park on Wednesday evening. The event, sponsored by the Interfaith Council, the Office of Religious Life, the Heartfulness Institute, Mindful USC and BreatheSC, aimed to allow individuals the opportunity to slow down and experience the many benefits of meditation. 
The Heartfulness Institute, a nonprofit organization followed by people in over 120 countries, had instructors who guided Wednesday’s event, offering relaxation and meditation programs free of charge for communities, universities, corporations and other types of organizations. 
“Today being the International Day of Peace from United Nations, we thought it would be a good day to raise awareness of the importance of meditation,” said Sreejith Periyadath, religious director of the Heartfulness Institute. “How it positively affects the individual peace, which ultimately results in world peace.”
Petra Reyes, a junior majoring in political science who attended the event, is a firm believer in meditation and its various applications for improving the self and mankind. 
“I think it is really beautiful for us to be able to come together and think about World Peace Day in a way that we can collectively use our energy for healing, for peace,” Reyes said. 
The International Day of Peace was first established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1981 and was further designated two decades later as a period of cease-fire and non-violence around the world, with the hope that nations, instead of fighting, educate and raise public awareness on issues related to peace.   
Since 2002, each International Day of Peace has had a theme. For 2016 the theme is “The Sustainable Development Goals: Building Blocks for Peace,” in reference to the 17 goals all 193 member nations of the U.N. adopted at the 2015 U.N. Sustainable Development Summit at their headquarters in New York. The lofty list of goals, which can be found on the United Nations Development Program website, will guide United Nation Development Programs for the next 15 years and focus on poverty alleviation, democratic governance and peacebuilding, climate change and disaster risk and economic inequality, with the ultimate purpose of the list being to achieve world peace. 
Achieving enlightenment and world peace aside, Pariyadath stressed that meditation can be especially beneficial for college students, many of whom are preparing to graduate and faced with the upcoming and intimidating responsibilities of life after college. 
“In the campus, we have a great young generation who is ready to go out and take on the challenges of the world, and they should be able to know how to center themselves, how to be more peaceful and calmer when they are faced with the daily challenges of life,” Pariyadath said. 
Meanwhile, for students who are only looking as far ahead as their next midterm, meditation could be the answer to managing stress. 
“It is something that I think is really important for college students, and it can be so easy to integrate as part of self care,” Reyes said. “To slow down and to just like try not to think about, you know: if you’ve got deadlines, if you’ve got work, if you’ve got school, to just think about what you need personally to heal your body, to heal your mind, to heal your soul.”
The Heartfulness Institute hopes to conduct more events in the coming months in conjunction with the other meditation groups around campus.

Julia Erickson | Daily Trojan
Two USC professors and a visiting scholar spoke about the changing way governments and their citizens communicate Wednesday at an event hosted by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy.
Philip Seib, a professor of journalism and public diplomacy at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and professor of international relations at the USC Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences, discussed his new book, The Future of #Diplomacy.
The conversation also included Conrad Turner, a visiting senior scholar at the Center on Public Diplomacy and a former diplomat who worked in Ukraine, Croatia, Austria and various other nations, as well as Jay Wang, director of the Center on Public Diplomacy.
The discourse was largely centered around the growing role of social media in modern diplomacy. Seib said that rapid advancements in technology that have allowed people to instantaneously consume, produce and share information have given nations the ability to not only communicate with foreign governments more quickly, but also to reach foreign publics directly.
“The key premise of the book is that the future of diplomacy is inextricably linked to the future of media,” Seib said. “It’s also linked to the public’s use of media to become more intense observers of and participants in the diplomatic process.”
Seib also noted that, as a result of these new channels of communication between governments and the public, people have felt more empowered to voice their opinions and become actively involved in policy decisions. In contrast to previous perceptions of diplomacy as taking place behind closed doors and in smoke-filled back rooms, there is a new expectation of transparency that was virtually inconceivable only a few decades ago.
“In the old days, the diplomatic process was conducted by an all-male group that was very elite and very separate from the public,” Seib said. “What has happened now is that the distance [between the public and government diplomats] has narrowed considerably because of all the information being provided by a range of media.”
Seib also discussed expanding diplomatic bureaucracy during the talk. 
He pointed out that various bureaucratic organizations within the government have grown exponentially in recent years, in part to meet the complex needs of today’s ever-changing nature of statecraft but also because certain policy areas have generated large amounts of attention and concern.
“If you’re in Washington and you put out your hands and say the word ‘counterterrorism,’ piles of money fall from the sky,” Seib said. “Bureaucracy follows money. If there’s funding, bureaucrats will follow, whether it’s appropriate or not.” 
Seib also pointed out that, while social media and other forms of modern communication can increase the transmission speed of diplomatic information between government officials and the public, it is important to remember that Twitter posts may not convey policy nuances as effectively as traditional methods.
“You need policy,” Seib said. “You can’t become so focused on the tools that you lose sight of the fact that you have to have policy, and policy doesn’t always boil down to 140 characters.”
Erin Pineda, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said that she enjoyed listening to Seib’s insights into today’s changing diplomatic environment, and that she will have to understand these developments to succeed in her future career.
“He talked about the closing gap between diplomats and domestic stakeholders and having to be held accountable to them and also constantly being subjected to their opinions,” Pineda said. “You think of [diplomacy] as unilateral where you’re making the decisions, but you have to remember that you are also being held accountable to domestic interests.”

The McClellan Law Firm via YouTubeCaptured on camera · Security footage of the incident shows Miguel Guerra’s car T-boning Kelsey Dresser’s vehicle as she turned onto campus at Gate 4 on Dec. 3, 2015. Dresser later died of her injuries.
The parents of a slain USC student filed a lawsuit against the University Wednesday, charging USC with the inadequate training of a Department of Public Safety officer who is currently charged with vehicular manslaughter.
Kelsey Dresser, a first-year USC graduate student in the Rossier School of Education, who killed in a crash with DPS officer Miguel Guerra on Dec. 3, 2015. Guerra was allegedly going nearly three times the speed limit at 69 mph when he smashed into the side of Dresser’s car as she was turning onto the USC campus. She died from head injuries in the hospital the following day.
The officer had been working consecutive graveyard shifts and his reaction time may have been impeded by the lack of sleep, according to the Los Angeles Times. Two empty energy drinks were found in his car.
Michael and Jill Dresser, the student’s parents, also sued Miguel Guerra for negligence and speeding. Los Angeles City Prosecutors charged Guerra with vehicular manslaughter in July. 
Dresser, who graduated from University of California Santa Barbara in 2014 with a degree in psychology, worked as a research assistant at an autism center and strove to promote mental health awareness issues. She was beginning her graduate studies in marriage and family therapy.
A representative from DPS would not comment on ongoing litigation, but redirected people to a post on the DPS website expressing condolences to the victim’s family.
“Our officers dedicate themselves to protecting our students, staff, faculty and everyone who visits the University,” the statement said. “This is an unprecedented and heartbreaking event for our department. We offer our deepest condolences to Kelsey’s family, friends, classmates and faculty.”
Ironic isn’t it? When a person uses a car to kill, liberals blame the driver, but when a gun is used to kill liberals blame the gun… just a thought.
No one blames the gun, don’t be ridiculous.  A gun is a tool that has no other use than killing or injuring another living thing. It also has the ability to kill numerous people very quickly at a significant distance.  The number of potential casualties is greatly increased using a gun over other tools of violence. The killer will always be the one who wields the gun.
No one blames the gun? Wow, I must have missed that email. My bad…sorry, Amhuizar. I did not know Hillary Clinton changed her opinion since May of 2014:
HRC: “We’ve got to rein in what has become almost an article of faith that almost anybody can have a gun anywhere at any time. And I don’t believe that is in the best interest of the vast majority of people.”
Charles
HRC saying that wide spread ownership of guns is not in the best interest of society is not the same as saying guns and not those firing them are to blame for gun deaths.  And incidentally believe it or not everyone doesn’t look to HRC to give us our opinions.  Some of us are capable of forming our own opinions.
Because in a modern society, cars play a functional role.
And you need to register your car, take a test to prove you can operate your car and follow the law, and carry a license for your car.
oh pah-leeze…tell that to the nearly 1m illegals driving with no reg/lic/ins in the state of CA, not to mention those in TX and FL and get back to me. But, I do agree, following laws would be a great idea. Enforcing our laws would be even better. If only, huh?
Under current state law DPS officers/vehicles are not allowed to use their warning lights and sirens on public roads when responding to calls. A new law (AB 2361) that takes affect on January will allow this to change. DPS officers will be appointed reserve LAPD police officers – it they have graduated from a state approved police academy and completed 664 hours of training, which includes 40 hours of vehicle operations. The law clarifies and places into state statue the approach to campus security that Stanford and the University of the Pacific have been doing for many years. 
Added to the California Penal Code on January 1, 2017 will be:
830.75. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 830.7, a person regularly employed as a security officer for an independent institution of higher education recognized under subdivision (b) of Section 66010 of the Education Code may be deputized or appointed by the sheriff or the chief of police of the jurisdiction in which the institution is located as a
reserve deputy or officer pursuant to Section 830.6, notwithstanding that he or she is compensated by the institution of higher education or that the assigned specific law enforcement functions and duties may be of a recurring or continuous nature, if both of the following requirements are met:
(1) The person meets the requirements specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 832.6.
(2) The institution of higher education and the appropriate local law enforcement agency have entered into a memorandum of understanding.
(b) The authority of a person designated as a peace officer pursuant to this section extends to any place in the state and applies only while he or she is engaged in the performance of his or her assigned duties for his or her institution of higher education pursuant to the memorandum entered into pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a). The primary duty of a person designated as a peace officer pursuant to this section shall be the enforcement of the law upon the campuses of his or her institution of higher education and within one mile of the exterior of those campuses, and in or about other grounds and properties owned, operated, controlled, or administered by that institution of higher education.
(c) Vehicles owned by an independent institution of higher education that are specifically designated for use by persons designated as peace officers pursuant to this section shall be deemed authorized emergency vehicles for all purposes of the law within the institution’s jurisdiction.
