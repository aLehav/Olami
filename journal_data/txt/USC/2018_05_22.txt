After 200 faculty members called for President C. L. Max Nikias’ resignation for the University’s handling of a student health center gynecologist accused of sexual misconduct, Nikias and the Board of Trustees both released statements indicating they plan to stay the course.
The gynecologist, Dr. George Tyndall, is accused of inappropriately touching patients during their examinations, making comments and asking questions about their personal lives and discriminating against Chinese students unfamiliar with American gynecology practices. Tyndall has denied the allegations in statements made to the Los Angeles Times.
In a letter to the USC community, USC Board of Trustees Chairman John Mork expressed the Board’s confidence in President Nikias’ leadership and his ability to make decisions on behalf of the University moving forward. 
“We strongly support President Nikias’ implementation of a thorough and comprehensive action plan that addresses these issues and enables USC to continue exemplifying our Trojan Family values as we move forward,” Mork said. 
He also expressed sympathy toward those who submitted reports regarding Tyndall’s conduct while at USC.
“We have zero tolerance for this conduct and will ensure that people are held accountable for actions that threaten the university student body and that do not reflect our culture of respect, care, and ethic,” Mork wrote. 
Nikias also sent a 20-page letter to the USC community detailing an action plan at the request of the Board to protect the University’s core values and mission. Primarily, Nikias announced the establishment of the President’s Campus Culture Commission to ensure that proper advice will be given to the senior leadership.
“The commission’s charge is to provide advice to the University’s senior leadership,” Nikias wrote in the letter. “Its work will be ongoing, and will begin at the start of the academic year with a half-day retreat, which will be attended by the university’s entire senior leadership, all deans, academic department chairs, directors of institutes, as well as other members of our community, drawn from both campuses.” 
Overall, the plan will address an external review done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, incorporate input from the University’s internal Task Force on Workplace Standards and Employee Wellness and implement new lessons and address areas of improvement that arose from the allegations brought forth against Tyndall and the student health center.
The action plan also includes the establishment of two new offices, the Office of Ombuds Services and the Office of Professionalism and Ethics, as well as the creation of three vice president positions for professionalism and ethics, human resources and communications. 
“I think one of the positive things about the action plan is that patients, faculty, and staff have places and are encouraged to report things through normal channels and to their supervisors,” USC Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said to the Daily Trojan. “But they also know that if they have concerns that are not addressed, they have other places to go confidentially and anonymously to report those. Those concerns are taken seriously and investigated.” 
With the new changes, Nikias hopes for a brighter future despite the trouble that was present this past year. 
“I would like to conclude with a heartfelt reflection on the strength of our community,” Nikias wrote. “This past year, although challenging at times, has reminded all of us of the tremendous love and loyalty of our Trojan Family. As we have tackled difficult issues, our spirit, resilience, and character have shone through — time and again. We are fortunate to have each other, and we inspire one another to evince the very best qualities we have as humans, and to share those qualities with our fellow Trojans.”
The statements came shortly after 200 USC faculty members published an letter calling for the Nikias’ resignation. 
“President Nikias’ own actions and omissions amount to a breach of trust,” the letter said. “He has lost the moral authority to lead the University, and in addition, to lead the investigation of institutional failures that allowed this misconduct to persist over several decades. President Nikias must step aside to allow new leaders to take the necessary steps to repair the damage.”
In the letter, the faculty expressed dissatisfaction toward the University for allowing Tyndall to quietly resign with a settlement and for not notifying the Medical Board of California, law enforcement and patients about the doctor’s alleged misconduct and abuse. 
“There still has been no public report of the investigation into the two cases involving USC medical deans, nor any visible attempt to determine what University administrators knew and when they knew it, and why they waited as long as they did to take action,” the letter said. “We lament that, time after time, the administration has admitted to its failings only after being exposed by the Los Angeles Times.” 
The faculty also expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of communication from the University to the community and asked why USC took so long to take action.
“We call upon President Nikias to step aside, and upon the Board of Trustees to restore moral leadership to the university,” the letter said. “We also call on the Board to reaffirm the core mission of the University, ‘the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit’ . . . Restore our trust in USC by standing up for its highest ideals.”
In addition to faculty, USC alumni are calling for the University administration to be held accountable for their lack of responsibility to the USC community. Moreover, Trojan Advocates for Political Progress released a statement last Friday expressing its disappointment in the University, calling for the Board of Trustees to evaluate Nikias’ conduct. 
One petition, “A Call for USC President Nikias’s Resignation,” was created last Thursday night, and had reached 2,402 signatures at the time of publication. 
Another, “Alumni Demand USC Hold Administration Accountable for Supporting Sexual Predators,” had 2,964 signatures at the time of publication, and was also created on Thursday. 
The faculty letter and those two petitions refer to the allegations regarding Tyndall’s misconduct, former Keck School of Medicine dean Carmen Puliafito’s use of illicit drugs during his tenure at USC, and former Keck dean Rohit Varma, who replaced Puliafito and was promoted despite the senior leadership’s knowledge of a previous sexual harassment allegation. 
“President Nikias has repeatedly proven that he does not take seriously the safety of women on USC’s campus,”one petition’s description read. “Nikias fails to provide transparency to students; his decisions have jeopardized student safety.”
Rini Sampath, a 2016 alumna and former Undergraduate Student Government president, said she created the petition calling for Nikias’ resignation.
“This case in particular enraged me, because it affected so many women on our campus, and I was seeing so many stories come forward on my timeline, and actual news articles, so I knew I had to do something,” Sampath said. “This petition is really an avenue for the entire community to express their concerns and express their disappointment in senior administration leadership. It’s meant to serve as a megaphone for every single person who wants to see real change at USC.”
The other petition was created by alumni Tiffany Panganiban and David Bocarsly, who both graduated from the Price School of Public Policy this year.
“[It] was created out of sheer frustration and disappointment at the mishandling of sexual abuse and misconduct by the USC administration and leadership over the past two years,” Panganiban wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
This petition also cited sexual misconduct allegations regarding former professor Erick Guerrero and former vice president of fundraising David Carrera. 
The two petitions claim that University administration handled these cases of  sexual misconduct inadequately, and failed to address the issues and inform the USC community in a timely manner, instead prioritizing the school’s image.
“USC has a crisis of moral leadership — there is a trend of USC administration not holding abusers accountable, instead rewarding them with financial payouts . . . not respecting the public’s right to know of dangers in the community, instead concealing vital public health information to preserve the institution’s reputation,” the alumni petition said. “Students are harmed and victimized by the very hands who ought to ensure their safety.” 
Panganiban also stated that the University needs to put the safety of students first, and act proactively rather than reactively to create a zero tolerance policy for abuse of power.  
By collecting signatures from fellow USC alumni, Panganiban hopes the Board of Trustees will listen to their recommendations. 
“That the gross negligence from the USC leadership in hiring staff with prior background in sexual misconduct, in handling investigations towards reports of abuse and misconduct, and in executing decisions will be reviewed and amended for the benefit of the Trojan community, particularly for the safety and wellbeing of students,” Panganiban said. 
TAPP President Alec Vandenberg said the organization decided to release a public statement after seeing frustrated students post about their disappointment on social media, including in the USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens Facebook group. 
“We consulted amongst ourselves as an executive board of a student organization with values of tolerance and accountability, and we wanted to hold our university to the same standards, so we decided to draft a public statement that expressed those values,” Vandenberg said.
The statement released by TAPP said the incidents, and the University’s limited communication about them with the USC community, represent a “profound breach of trust” to the student body.
“We as an organization condemn the unforgivable, decades-long inaction of the executive administration of our University whose duty lies in prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of its student body,” the TAPP statement said.

Four lawsuits from seven women were filed against former health center gynecologist George Tyndall this week, alleging sexual assault and abusive behavior during patient examinations. The lawsuits come after the University fired two health clinic supervisors and more than 200 complaints were submitted to the university hotline last week.

In the first lawsuit, four of the plaintiffs will be represented by John Manly, the lead attorney who helped settle a sexual assault case against Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar last week. 
“The four plaintiffs want this to never happen to another Trojan again,” Manly said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “These people are not the enemies of the University, quite the opposite. These are our friends and neighbors and people who went to the university, just like I did. It’s shocking, given what USC sells itself as, that they would be treated this way.”
According to the first lawsuit’s complaints statement, the first plaintiff claimed that during a medical appointment in 2003, Tyndall use his ungloved hand to penetrate her vagina up to his wrist. She reported that she was abused an estimated eight times until 2007, with Tyndall forcefully inserting his fingers and hands without protection each time. 
The second plaintiff listed in the complaint alleged that Tyndall forced her to disrobe, groped her and digitally penetrated her. Tyndall also asked her questions about her sexual history that she felt were of inappropriate nature, such as if she had ever swallowed semen. From 2008 to 2014, she reported suffering abuse from Tyndall on at least two other occasions. 
“For most women, the first time they go see a gynecologist is in college,” Manly said. “And a lot of them go because they need care or because they want to be sexually active to get better contraceptives. That’s a very vulnerable time — an emotional time — and the allegations are that Dr. Tyndall took advantage of this, which is disgusting, if true.” 
The third woman went in to receive treatments for an infection and reported experiencing assault similar to that reported by the second plaintiff. However, she also said that Tyndall continued to penetrate her despite her pleas to stop, and that he never gave her the proper medical examination that she had requested. 
The fourth woman listed in the complaint claimed that she had scheduled an appointment to treat lower abdominal pain that she was experiencing. During her appointment with Tyndall, he exhibited behavior that she found inappropriate, such as digitally penetrating her vagina with two fingers on multiple occasions and asking questions about her sexual orientation and history that she found intrusive. 
A federal class action lawsuit was also filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, by a fifth woman named Lucy Chi, alleging she was violated by Tyndall during an appointment with him in 2012. In a third lawsuit, represented by attorney David Ring, a sixth woman alleged Tyndall inserted his fingers into her vagina during a pelvic exam and commented about the tightness of her vaginal muscle. 
The fourth lawsuit was filed by high-profile lawyer Gloria Allred on behalf of Filipina communication management graduate student Daniella Mohazab claims that Tyndall compared her to his wife, who is also Filipina, while asking her questions about her sexual history. She also alleges that Tyndall inserted his ungloved hand into her vagina in a routine STD test that usually is administered by the patient on their own. 
At a press conference held Tuesday, Allred said a number of young women, including Mohazab, Angela Hawkins, and another woman who wished to remain anonymous, came to her with concerns about Tyndall’s conduct. 
Allred announced her lawsuit on behalf of Mohazab, and called upon the University to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations made against Tyndall. 
Hawkins, who was seen by Tyndall when she was an undergraduate student in 2006 after being allegedly sexually assaulted by a fellow student. Hawkins claims that the Engemann Student Health Center told her that USC destroyed medical records from her visit with Tyndall some time between 2015 and 2017. 
“I saw Dr. Tyndall because I was violated by another man, and now, I feel violated again,” Hawkins said in the press conference. “It is horrifying to know that at such a vulnerable time in my life, I was in the hands of a predator.”
In her statement, Hawkins also urged victims to not use the University’s hotline for concerns regarding Tyndall, because she said the concerns were being sent to the University’s legal team. She encouraged victims to instead contact independent attorneys who could represent them. 
At the press conference, Allred read a statement made by a 1992 graduate from USC who wished to remain anonymous. The woman alleged that during a routine visit for a pap smear, Tyndall took pictures of her genitals. She also alleged that nothing came of complaints she made against Tyndall to the health center and to the University. 
“The University needs to stop looking at these victims as adversaries,” Manly said. “These women are not their adversaries, they’re a part of the university and they need to embrace it and they need to acknowledge wrongdoing.”
According to Manly, since there was an extended time period between when the incidents reportedly took place and were notified, USC may end up using California’s statute of limitations as a defense. Although the law states that a person must file the complaint within a certain of time, this time period typically begins when the victim realizes they suffered harm.  
However, Manly stated that the Discovery Rule, which applies if a victim did not know they were being assaulted at the time of the alleged incident, could suspend the statute of limitation.
“Clearly, there is a culture that values silence and the image of the institution over individual human beings,” Manly said. “That culture is why this kind of stuff happens. It is why it happened at Michigan State with Larry Nassar and we’re going to find out it is why it happened at USC with Dr. Tyndall. It needs to change.”
The University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan it will focus on supporting its students.
“We are focused on ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students and providing support to those affected,” the statement said.

An incomplete list of news items from the past week: the Russia probe got a potential end date, 10 students were killed in a school shooting, an American actress married into the British royal family, the U.S. tried to stay out of a trade war with China, a volcano caused thousands of Hawaiians to evacuate their homes, Deadpool 2 came out, and — wait, a volcano?
Even if you are trying to keep up with the news, you may have missed updates on the ongoing eruption of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island. Kilauea’s volcanic activity increased dramatically when one of its crater floors collapsed April 30, which pushed a huge pool of lava underground and, several days later, caused that lava to reemerge through fissures in residential areas of the island. As of Sunday, the lava flows were still moving across Big Island, and some were reaching the ocean, pushing plumes of hydrochloric acid and fine glass into the air as molten rock made contact with cool seawater. In any year before 2018, a large-scale natural disaster like the Kilauea eruption would be a front-page story. 
And yet, the average mainland citizen without a personal connection to Kilauea has probably only heard about its volcanic activity a few times over the last three weeks. I’ll admit, I knew little about it before I fell down a rabbit hole of lava livestreams (they exist, and they’re terrifying). But as I looked at footage of the Hawaiian sky filled with ash, I was struck by how ironic it is that natural disasters are often covered in less detail than the average White House press briefing.
The modern news cycle seems to have little time for natural events, concerned as it is — and as it should be — with the many problems in the political, economic and social realms. I am by no means saying that these issues do not deserve to be covered with detail and rigor, but the lack of coverage of the Kilauea eruption and other natural disasters represents people’s isolation from and fear of the natural world.
We, as a society, tend to look away from nature because it is hard to quantify — to predict, time or measure. Natural events can feel random, and as such are hard to find a narrative in, plus Mother Nature was never known to give good sound bites. Nature doesn’t fit into our timelines, our news cycles or our schedules, not to mention the fact that it is scary to think about the myriad earthquakes, eruptions, droughts, animal attacks and wildfires that could easily lead to our demise. 
It makes sense that we like to ignore things like Kilauea, or anything else that reminds us of the truly awe-inspiring power of the Earth and the comparatively short, meaningless lives we lead. Footage of burning lava, swirling hurricanes and sturdy glaciers are not-so-subtle reminders that Earth was here long before us and will be here long after, and they force us to confront our own mortality. To avoid engaging in these topics, we choose instead to focus on the more quotidian issues, which is not a bad response, but can easily be taken too far.
It is this de-emphasis of nature — prioritizing human issues before environmental issues — that has allowed us to harm the planet so recklessly for the last two centuries. It is possible to reconcile between the modern world we live in and the natural world that allowed them to flourish. However, it does require some readjustment of priorities — namely, what we give our attention to and how willing we are to take time out of our day to think about the Earth in the midst of our political and social turmoil. 
So, in the name of readjusting attention, welcome to “Pale Blue Dot,” a column about the most important issue that we almost never talk about: our planet. 
Kylie Harrington is a junior majoring in journalism. Her column,“Pale Blue Dot,” runs Wednesdays.

As USC professor William G. Tierney said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, “The university has lost its way.”
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
In the last week, the USC community has been rattled by a Times investigation that revealed the disturbing misconduct of former Engemann health center gynecologist George Tyndall. 
The investigation uncovered abhorrent details about Tyndall’s predatory behavior toward the female students he treated in the health center as a USC gynecologist. During this three-decade period, a number of USC staff members, including those who worked in the health center, have reported his inappropriate behavior — but to no avail. USC claims it was not aware of Tyndall’s behavior until 2016, and even then, the administration stated it held no legal obligation to report Tyndall to the Medical Board of California. 
This wave of allegations comes at a time when USC is attempting to cement its identity as an elite institution — an effort spearheaded by a president who seems to prioritize fundraising above all else. Over the past year, the University has seen a $700 million expansion project through USC Village, and its admissions rate has dropped to an all-time low of 12.9 percent. And yet, students have perhaps become more distrustful than ever of their shiny new school. 
Moving forward, this is not a problem that can be addressed by simply sending out half-hearted apologies, promises to exercise transparency and an action plan to allegedly improve campus culture — USC’s leadership needs to do more. This is about questioning the values and culture of a University that was built on power and privilege. 
Last week’s scandal is the latest addition to a laundry list of misconduct by University staff. USC has been plagued with allegations since last July, particularly surrounding revelations about former Keck School of Medicine dean Carmen Puliafito’s drug use — which now appears to be the tip of the iceberg. In later months, USC assistant basketball coach Tony Bland was arrested for bribery and corruption and both Keck dean Rohit Varma and university vice president of fundraising David Carrera left their posts amid sexual harassment allegations.
As a short-term solution, the University must immediately take concrete actions to ensure the transparency of faculty and staff misconduct through sexual abuse response training, hosting town hall meetings and seriously investigating reported claims. Too often, administrative decisions are made behind closed doors, with announcements made after the fact — usually just hours before the Times publishes the findings of an investigation. It is disappointing that these allegations against Tyndall would not have come to light if the Times did not seek to report them.
But it will take much more to gain back the trust of students and professors. On Tuesday, 200 USC professors penned a letter to express their “outrage and disappointment” toward the University’s — specifically President C. L. Max Nikias’ — failure to protect students and staff from repeated instances of sexual harassment and misconduct. But while distinguished faculty members are calling for Nikias’ resignation, Chairman of the Board of Trustees John Mork released a statement that the Board has “full confidence in President Nikias’ leadership, ethics, and values and is certain that he will successfully guide our community forward.” 
In addition to receiving the Board of Trustees’ support, Nikias sent a 20-page letter to the USC community detailing his plan to address and “lead change in our culture.” The president’s plan not only calls for the creation of three new vice president positions — one for professionalism and ethics, one for human resources, and one for communications — but also for the establishment of two offices for ombuds services and another for professionalism and ethics. 
These plans, though well intentioned, simply mean nothing to the University’s most important stakeholders: its students. If Nikias’ plan was to merely pay lip service to the Board of Trustees, then this might have worked. However, the truth is that the creation of these new entities introduces more challenges and barriers that will impede the reporting of misconduct and abuse, and will likely prove the ineffectiveness of increased bureaucracy. What USC needs goes beyond transparency, and it goes beyond senior administrators taking ownership of the scandals that have plagued our campus in the past year. What USC needs is to rebuild its culture from the ground up — which may entail a change in leadership.
Although it points to a dramatic shift in the University’s identity, the initiative to remove Nikias from office is not far-fetched. Perhaps it has come to this point. After all, the complete turmoil surrounding last week’s events was self-inflicted. Amid these incidents, Nikias has — time and time again — chosen preserving reputation and pleasing trustees over the safety and well-being of his students. 
No matter the course of action it takes, the University must seriously reconsider its priorities as an institution of higher learning and, more importantly, as a second home to 45,500 young adults. Ultimately, USC belongs to the students — not Nikias, not Quick and certainly not the 59 philanthropists and business tycoons that make up the Board of Trustees.

Rating: 5/5 stars
As the sun set over the Rose Bowl on Friday evening, the air fairly crackled with energy and excitement. Over 60,000 people had packed the Pasadena stadium for the Los Angeles leg of Taylor Swift’s reputation Stadium Tour. 
The audience’s anticipation was palpable, bolstered by spirited performances by opening acts Charli XCX and Camila Cabello. When Swift finally burst onto the stage in a blaze of crimson and a plume of smoke, the audience erupted, exploding into an elated ovation that even prompted an amazed reaction from the veteran performer. 
“Well, hello Los Angeles,” Swift purred, a smile painted on her scarlet red lips. 
Swift performed 14 out of 15 tracks off her reputation album, excluding only “So It Goes…” The album’s darker, edgier tone translated to the concert’s concept and production, with backup dancers swathed in menacing black cloaks and larger-than-life projections of Swift framed by a steely industrial backdrop.
Swift’s Friday concert had a sold-out crowd of 60,000. Allen Pham | Daily Trojan
The singer eschewed subtlety in favor of a full embrace of her reptilian transformation. She sported snakeskin print leotards, a Gucci-style snake embroidered jacket and even a golden serpent twined around her microphone. But it was the set pieces that featured the most overt imagery; during “Look What You Made Me Do,” an enormous ruby-eyed cobra uncoiled from the stage. Swift as a performer was sleek and sinuous, strutting smoothly in sky-high boots and seamlessly transitioning between songs. Though it was her first time performing at the Rose Bowl, Swift looked right at home, a feat only a seasoned artist of her caliber could pull off. 
Fostering a sense of intimacy with fans in the massive venue, Swift’s star power was truly on display, however, when the flashy visuals disappeared and she held the audience spellbound with nothing but her commanding stage presence. During “Delicate,” she was the embodiment of ethereality, floating in a golden cage above a sea of shimmering wristbands; she played pared down versions of “Long Live” and “New Year’s Day” on the piano and stripped away the synthy electronic accoutrements of “Dancing With Our Hands Tied,” leaving only a girl and her guitar. 
But Swift bounced back with her signature high-energy bops before long. Charli XCX and Cabello returned to the stage for a fun, confetti-filled dance party with “Shake It Off,” and Shawn Mendes made a special guest appearance to sing “There’s Nothing Holding Me Back.” The show ended with a blast, literally, as fireworks launched into the sky during the exuberant, celebratory closing number “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” Swift frolicking around in a fully functional water fountain like a phoenix risen from the ashes. 
Reputation is hardly Swift’s first rodeo; it is her fifth concert tour, and she is known to be an extremely meticulous, detailed-oriented artist. From the opening montage that spliced together disparaging comments made by Swift’s critics, to the behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage that kept the audience rapt as they shuffled out of the stadium, the slick, glossy production of the reputation Stadium Tour is unparalleled. With her latest showstopper, Swift proves that her only competition is herself.

Rating: 4/5 stars
Since gaining U.S. recognition with its first Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist last year, seven-member Korean boy band BTS  has performed at the 2017 American Music Awards, appeared on countless talk shows and released its third Japanese studio album. On May 18, BTS released Love Yourself: Tear. It is the first full length album in the Love Yourself series, following the 2017 EP “Love Yourself: Her.”
With signature hip-hop beats, heartbreakingly raw ballads and socially conscious messages, BTS shows off its versatility and candor in Love Yourself: Tear. In several interviews, group leader RM said that Love Yourself: Tear would be about the complexities of  love, whether it be romantic, platonic or self-love.
For new ARMY members, the name of BTS’ fanbase, here’s the rundown: a new BTS album is not simply music. There are new hair colors, choreography and fan chants. BTS’ music follows a story arc — linked through music videos and album extras — so eagle-eyed fans must go back at least an album or two in order to appreciate the full masterpiece of a new one. 
The album begins with “Intro: Singularity,” a soulful solo performance by V. The R&B-inspired track is reminiscent of V’s other solo “Stigma” on 2016 album Wings. On “Singularity,” the record’s  theme can be understood with lyrics such as “My voice was buried for you” and “Should I not have thrown myself away?” The eerie, intimate music video echoes these words with the recurring theme of masks.

The music video for single “Fake Love,” which was released on the same day as the album, garnered 35.9 million views within  the first 24 hours of its release, becoming the third most viewed music video of all time on YouTube in 24 hours, behind Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” and fellow Korean artist Psy’s “Gentleman.” With a bass-filled chorus and a simple chant, “Fake Love” is the kind of high-energy pop song that U.S. radio stations love. On Sunday, BTS graced the  Billboard Music Awards stage with a powerful performance of “Fake Love,” and the audience’s enthusiastic reaction may be a strong indicator of the song’s future impact on American pop radio.
Another standout track is “The Truth Untold,” a ballad featuring Steve Aoki, with whom BTS has previously collaborated. Above a simple piano melody, member Jungkook laments how hard it is to be vulnerable: “You know that I can’t show you me / Give you me.”
The storyline continues with “Anpanman,” as lively beats disguise emotional lyrics about a superhero who endures pain to save others. Closer “Outro: Tear” ties up BTS’ story by mixing in samples from their music videos with new raps from RM, Suga and J-Hope. The eleven-track album demonstrates  the depth and breadth of BTS’s socially aware music. Besides connecting with ARMY on Twitter, BTS has been inspiring youth all over the world as they, too, struggle through their own hardships in life. 
Next, BTS will be promoting its album with a performance on The Ellen Show, Late Night with James Corden and an international broadcast live comeback show on Mnet, a South Korean music television channel.

A jury ruled in favor of the NCAA in former USC football coach Todd McNair’s defamation trial in Los Angeles on Monday.
Todd McNair was fired as USC’s running backs coach in 2010, when the NCAA deemed he knew of improper benefits. Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information.
McNair was the running backs coach when the Reggie Bush scandal broke  in 2010, and his contract was terminated after six years on the USC coaching staff. It was determined he knew about some of the gifts that Bush and his family received. After  a four-year investigation on Bush and the USC’s football program, the NCAA banned USC from bowl games for two years and imparted scholarship restrictions.
In the current defamation trial, McNair fought for his name and accused the NCAA of altering evidence to connect him with the scandal and justify increasing the sanctions placed on USC. 
McNair and his lawyer claimed that the NCAA released information that it knew was false, and they accused NCAA President Mark Emmert of slander for vocally supporting the false reports. He sued the NCAA in June 2011, claiming that false information hurt him in his job search after the Bush scandal. McNair and his lawyer asked for $27 million in damages. 
About halfway through the trial, one of the jurors was dismissed due to an obstructing language barrier, and deliberations restarted with a replacement juror. 
After six days of deliberation, the jury ruled 9-3 that the statements made about McNair were not false. 
“I don’t think the NCAA should come away from this thinking they did things right,” the head juror said to the Los Angeles Times. “I think the entire jury room was very, very disappointed and we wanted to do something.”
The head juror said that McNair could have won a case for negligence or breach of contract, both claims that his lawyers dropped before closing arguments. Ultimately, McNair’s proof for defamation fell short. 
McNair’s lawyer Bruce Broillet made a statement following the verdict and insinuated that their fight was not over. 
“Very, very disappointed … in the result,” he said. “Assessing the situation and considering our next steps.”

The USC baseball team dropped two out of three games against No. 2 Oregon State this past weekend. Entering the series on Friday with a 24-23 overall record, the Trojans looked to maintain a positive record against, perhaps, the toughest adversary they have faced this season.

Going into the series, the Beavers touted an impressive 40-8-1 record. That record includes a series win over No. 3 Stanford, who handed USC a series sweep with a total score of 34-2. Everything on paper set this three-game matchup to be a rout in favor of the Beavers. 
USC’s failure to muster a run in the first game and a rough 7-run loss in game two proved Oregon State’s dominance, but the series was not a blowout.
Game one on Friday night was a battle of starting pitchers. Senior lefty Luke Heimlich commanded the hill for the Beavers, holding a no hit bid until the sixth inning and preventing a Trojans’ score for 8.1 innings before he was relieved. Heimlich earned his 13th win of the season (13-1) and improved his season ERA to 2.69. 
On the other side of the diamond, freshman right-hander Kyle Hurt manned the mound. Though he allowed 4 runs, Hurt’s start was not a bad outing. Pitching 7.0 innings, he recorded five strikeouts, walked just two batters and stranded six baserunners. Hurt has struggled with walks in his rookie season, but he located pitches and was able to work out of some sticky situations. 
The Men of Troy were unable to recover from the four-run deficit, as they could only put four runners on base — none of which were converted. The final score showed 4-0 in favor of OSU.
Game two clinched a series win for the Beavers. After allowing 2 runs in the top of the first, the Trojans responded with a run of their own. Sophomore left fielder Blake Sabol led off with a single to center field. He would then be driven in on a RBI single from redshirt junior designated hitter Stephen Dubb. Through the remaining eight innings USC was unable to plate another run. Meanwhile, Oregon State had no problem crossing home as it scored 6 more runs to mount a final score of 8-1. 
With just 10 hits and 1 run over the first two games, viewers felt as if game three was set to see the same fate. However, a solid pitching and hitting performance led the Trojans to close the series with a notable 8-0 win over their second-ranked opponent. 
Junior right-hander Solomon Bates started on the hill. In a 7.0 inning shutout affair, he set up the Trojan lineup for success. Bates allowed just four hits and four walks while recording eight K’s before he was relieved. Sophomore Connor Lunn continued Bates’ solid performance allowing one walk and one hit ­— neither of which scored. The game marked Oregon State’s first shutout loss since April 30, 2016 against Stanford.
“I’m proud of [Bates] for what he’s accomplished, how much he’s grown as a pitcher over the last year,” heach coach Dan Hubbs said. “This was just another really good outing that he’s given us … He’s been Mr. Consistent.”
The stellar pitching performance allowed the batting order to shine. As a whole, the Men of Troy recorded nine hits and drew four walks. The team’s hitting performance was headlined by Sabol, who exhibited his all-star mentality. In his 5 at-bats, he recorded a single, two home runs and five RBIs. Junior center fielder Lars Nootbaar also drove in two runs. 
“I think [winning game three] is a big deal for us, especially getting into next season,” Sabol said to the Pac-12 Network. “We still have a young group of guys and we’ve proven again and again that we can beat anyone anywhere.”
Consistency has been a problem for this young team, especially at the plate. However, when pitching and hitting come together for the Trojans, they are a force to be reckoned with. If USC can find that consistency toward the end of this season or over the off-season, it will be a dangerous ball team in 2019. 
The Trojans will now prepare to welcome Cal State Northridge to Dedeaux Field for its final series of the regular season, a matchup that should favor USC.

Instant replay review was supposed to be a godsend for sports. Referees are humans and, as we know, humans often make mistakes. With the aid of technology and the ability to analyze plays frame by frame, video reviews were supposed to make plays more objective and less controversial. It was meant to save us from points of contention when the stakes are highest. 
But the opposite has happened. Instead video review is actively ruining sports as we know them, making games laborious and cumbersome, while adding more controversy. I long for the good old days when referees relied on the naked eye to make calls in real time. Now, refs turn to review for all of their answers, like a child who looks to his or her parents when overcome by shyness. 
We’ve seen video review practically ruin the Pac-12, where referees feel the need to painstakingly talk over every first down or two-yard rushing touchdown. Yes, getting calls right is important, but so is keeping games exciting and watchable. 
I remember sitting in the press box during the USC-Arizona game last November. In theory, it should have been a thrilling contest. Quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Khalil Tate traded big plays in a 49-35 shootout. But with 17 penalty calls and seemingly thousands of video reviews, the game lasted over four hours and finished up just before midnight. What could have been an exciting game ended up being as stop-and-go as L.A. traffic. There’s a problem here: We’ve reached the point of instant replay overkill. 
Video review was first introduced in the NFL in 1986, and it became universal in college football in 2004. Oftentimes instant replay is necessary in football, especially after close sideline catches or fumbles (probably the toughest plays to call with the naked eye). But today instant replay is being overused to the point where the entire definition of a catch is now up for debate.
The catch debate began during a 2014 Divisional Round playoff game between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers. In the fourth quarter, Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant made an incredible grab on fourth down to keep his team’s hopes alive … or so we thought. After a challenge, the referees determined that Bryant did not maintain possession throughout the catch and overturned the call. It still remains one of the more nonsensical calls in NFL history. He totally caught it. 
The debate continued with subsequent plays, like this season when Steelers’ tight end Jesse James appeared to catch a touchdown against the Patriots with just 30 seconds left. It was also overturned after video review, because he apparently did not maintain control of the ball. To most fans, it looked like a clearcut touchdown. 
Finally in March, NFL owners voted on a new rule that cleared up the catch issue (under the new rules, Bryant and James’s catches would have held up). However, I can’t help but think that the controversy would not exist if not for video review and its frustrating ability to make games overly complicated and convoluted.
The video replay situation is much worse in Major League Soccer, where the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) was introduced in 2017. It added an extra referee who reviews important plays from the booth.
“The VAR’s job is to watch those monitors, quickly identify potential missed calls, watch replays and communicate what he or she is seeing to the center referee over a headset,” Sports Illustrated’s Alexander Abnos explained last year.
According to Abnos, VARs are supposed to review only important plays like goals and red cards. Yet just a year after its implementation, VAR has been vastly overused to the detriment of MLS.
On Sunday, league-leaders Atlanta United FC thought they had secured a 2-0 lead against New York Red Bulls after forward Josef Martinez scored a skillful goal. No foul was called on the field, but acting video assistant referee Mark Geiger apparently thought Martinez committed an infraction before netting and brought the play to a review. After it was looked over for about two minutes, the goal was disallowed. Yet, Martinez had barely grazed a defender before scoring.
Later in the game, the Red Bulls were awarded a penalty kick, following another foul with very little contact. But this time time VAR was not used, to the chagrin of Atlanta fans. Suddenly the game was swung by two goals in New York’s favor, almost solely due to referee decisions. New York went on to defeat Atlanta 3-1.
Soccer is supposed to be a free-flowing game with limited stops and breaks, yet VAR is doing its best to destroy that notion. Consequently, referees are now far too involved in the outcome of games. 
“This train is not going to stop. VAR will continue to dominate storylines, but that’s not what’s most important here,” wrote Joe Patrick for Dirty South Soccer. “The most important aspect of VAR is how it toys with human emotion. It leaves fans feeling empty and foolish for celebrating a goal. This is the problem. The game is meant for the fans, but it’s becoming more and more academic every passing week.”
Instant replay can be a good thing. It can help clear up controversial scoring plays and make sure teams don’t get away with egregious fouls or penalties. But when overused, video replays make games choppy and often add new layers of dispute — exactly what they are supposed to prevent. 
Referees need to stop relying on replays to make most of their important calls and start using their own eyes. I’m not sure if I can sit through another four-hour Pac-12 football game.
