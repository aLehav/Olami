Earlier this month, the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point announced a plan to resolve budget issues by reallocating resources to fund more lucrative academic programs. As a result of this restructuring, the university would cut 13 liberal arts majors — notably, English, political science and history — in favor of disciplines that traditionally receive  higher demands for employment, particularly in the realms of business and engineering.

Considering the essential nature of basic subjects like English to one’s education, it comes as a surprise that an institution dedicated to higher learning would drop so many liberal arts programs with such resolve. And yet, the message behind this decision is one students have been hearing a lot lately: In such a competitive job market, there is simply no place for the liberal arts. This mindset is, undoubtedly, short-sighted — and it is one that colleges must work to eliminate if they truly want to foster a holistic education for their students. 
These cuts come at a time of disagreement concerning what type of education will best meet the needs of our evolving society. While colleges commonly stress idealistic notions like “searching for the truth,” many conservatives reject such messages because they foster the formation of liberal, impractical viewpoints. In 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker unsuccessfully attempted to alter the fundamental code of the state’s university system by changing the wording of philosophies like “improve the human condition” to “meet the state’s workforce needs.” 
And yet, now more than ever, liberal arts majors are not just useful, but also necessary. In a bustling workforce where the “next big thing” in technology alters the fabrics of companies year after year, employers need graduates who are willing to learn on the job. As products of an interdisciplinary education that prioritizes the ability to think critically, students of the liberal arts are trained to apply the crucial skill of adaptability to their work. In other words, they are not taught what to think, but how to think.
Job prospects aside, one must also consider how a focus in the liberal arts can impact the quality of their educational experience. When students — especially those attending highly selective colleges — are taught to be multi-faceted learners throughout elementary, middle and high school, it is illogical to assume that freshmen have found their callings the moment they step through the doors of a university. 
The liberal arts provide students with opportunities to explore disciplines they haven’t previously considered, and to consider viewpoints to which they haven’t  yet been exposed — opportunities that evidently pay off in the long run. Regarding a 2016 study about the undergraduate experiences of 1,000 alumni, Inside Higher Ed reports that a general, liberal arts education directly aligns with a greater sense of satisfaction with graduates’ professional and personal lives. Among other benefits, liberal arts graduates were more likely to demonstrate leadership characteristics later in life. 
With regard to USC, the University does a better job than most at instilling undergraduates with a diverse educational background. As most students know, USC requires that all bachelor’s degree candidates complete eight courses in the six core literacies: the arts, life sciences, physical sciences, humanistic inquiry and social analysis. And yet, the partiality toward pre-professional schools is still undeniably apparent. At USC, specialized colleges like the Marshall School of Business, the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism receive substantially more special attention and funding than the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, where students attend classes in older — or, as the University puts it, “historic” — buildings with fewer resources.
Moreover, one must consider the fact that whereas the aforementioned trade schools accommodate a relatively small number of majors with highly specialized advisers, Dornsife encompasses just about everything else. Considering that the college contains 140 different majors and minors, a Dornsife student can study economics, African American studies or biophysics. And while this variety affords students with the opportunity to switch majors or double major with relative ease, the immensity of the college paired with a failure to consolidate resources may leave many students overlooked.
In response to increasing disregard for the liberal arts, many colleges should follow the example set by universities like USC and implement a multi-disciplinary general education program that both exposes students to diverse material and helps prepare them for the workforce. Additionally, while many do not have the financial resources to do so, some universities would benefit from looking into creating smaller, more individualized schools for the liberal arts. Yale University, for example, provides such a system in which departments of disciplines like English and history are allowed to thrive. 
In its entirety, the shift of focus from the liberal arts to trade schools represents a valid concern for the future of the workforce — but universities such as those in Wisconsin are approaching the issue from the wrong perspective. While pre-professional schools surely enable many students to seamlessly enter the workforce after college, by no means does that justify the elimination of the invaluable educational experience provided by liberal arts curricula. If the goal of a university education truly is to “search for the truth” or “understand the human condition,” then students should be taught not just how to navigate a single trade, but also how to navigate a changing world.

Are we still talking about Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School? I mean that — honestly. Are you? Whether miraculous or disappointing, the Parkland, Fla., shooting, in which a gunman opened fire on students at Stoneman Douglas leaving 17 dead, seemed to stick with us for about a month and a half. In a 24-hour news cycle, in an age in which mass atrocities seem to dominate the headlines one instant only to be discarded the very next, this longer period of attention was unprecedented. My God, I thought. This time, will people care? 
The fact that this particular shooting brought a genuine gun control discussion into the mainstream conversation is pretty miraculous, and has much to do with the willingness of those several survivors — Emma González and David Hogg, especially — to continue speaking. They’ve drawn the ire and the fire of different Republican representatives and pundits — one among them, former Republican candidate for Maine State House Leslie Gibson, who called González a “skinhead lesbian.” Gibson’s often outlandish comments have only helped to further student activists’ shelf-lives in the media. The lesson, it seems, is clear: Don’t stop. On Thursday night, a rally was held here at USC for the March for Our Lives movement, featuring an alliance of student organizations committed to disallowing the disappearance of the issue at our own university. The nationwide movement to force Congress to hold a genuine gun debate, and pass the legislation that a vast, vast majority of Americans have consistently supported — common-sense gun reform, including nationwide registration, background checks and the elimination of gun show loopholes and bump stocks — begins on every grassroots level and belongs on every college campus. 
At a political conference last month, I attended a networking dinner and ended up sitting next to a California Republican Party official. She seemed sympathetic to our fear for the danger that still exists, the concern we had for our country, and for our lives. So, I told her, hoping she could tell her colleagues, that every time I sit down in a lecture hall it occurs to me to sit in a strategic location. Every time the door opens, I watch to see who enters. Making the decision to live, learn and work on a college campus has become a risk-laden enterprise; I don’t trust that I am truly safe here. I can only hope that, as anyone could, no one will happen to decide to kill us all. After all, as long as our representatives continue to abdicate their responsibility to protect us, who will stop them?
But they can’t listen if we aren’t speaking. We can iterate and reiterate the extent to which gun control, and those same common-sense reforms, have been presented and supported and championed and proposed and reproposed; their death always occurs in silence. Our government, theoretically, is supposed to function based on the pressure of voters affecting the votes of their representatives. No pressure, no effect — no vote.
Thursday’s rally was deeply moving, but it occurred in a nearly empty room. The amount of open seats, if anything, evinced more than the unfortunate nature of the weather or the apathy of a Thursday night — it was a clear-cut demonstration of our campus-wide unwillingness to do anything more than philosophize from the comfort of the Facebook wall, or experience fear and uncertainty without mustering the self-respect and moxy to do anything about it. This is not a march for an -ism that may or may not affect you; it is not a movement in the abstract, and there may not be another chance to achieve this level of attention. We aren’t close at all to a solution; and yet, pitifully, this small amount of acknowledgement feels so bold, so near, so monumental. Your choice to attend class could end your life. That seems to be a fact of the American landscape, and one our representatives — congressional Republicans especially — are all too willing to accept. 
In that near-empty room, several voices were heard by the few who were there. A husband who lost his wife; a woman who lost a next-door neighbor; the older brother of a Parkland survivor, who will forever remember the painstaking time he spent waiting to learn that his brother had, eventually, been evacuated. You must be willing to show up, in-person, rally, in-person, and call your representatives yourselves. You must be willing to hear survivors’ voices, to know survivors’ stories, to learn about the proposals and the legislation and the long road ahead. You must agree to embark upon it with the rest of us, who wish not to be shot in school. 
Common-sense gun control is an immediate necessity of American life. Until we have it, the public is not safe, and the people are not free. Your constitutional right to life is being sidelined by representatives who value National Rifle Association dollars higher than American lives. Those who would oppose reform are recklessly regressive; those who would ignore it are just as culpable. This is our modern American reality. 
The March for Life is on Saturday — I hope to see you there.

In the wake of last month’s school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., student leaders across campus organized the March for SC rally Thursday to protest gun violence in America.

According to one of the event’s founders, sophomore Shir Attias, the event was inspired by actions nationwide after the Parkland shooting that led to the #NeverAgain movement calling for gun control legislation. The purpose of these events are to raise awareness and start a dialogue concerning school shootings across the nation. The rally was held at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, and drew an estimated 40 attendees. While it was originally planned to be held at the Tommy Trojan statue, the rally’s location was changed due to inclement weather. 
The March for SC is co-sponsored by various student organizations, including Undergraduate Student Government assemblies and campus political advocacy groups. The idea for the campaign was developed by sophomores Alec Vandenberg, a Daily Trojan columnist, CJ Wechsler, Michaela Murphy, Attias and junior Mai Mizuno. Over the past month, the group created a social media campaign, held the student campus rally, and is organizing resources for students to participate in the March for Our Lives in Los Angeles, which takes place Saturday.
“We wanted to make this a unified effort,” Vandenberg said. “We really wanted to make sure we did a lot of outreach because not only are all students affected by gun violence, everyone can be a part of the dialogue and everyone can be a part of the solution.”
The social media campaign, which started on March 14, was created to spread awareness and demonstrate support for the March for Our Lives movement, where supporters added a March for SC frame to their social media profile pictures. 
Thursday’s rally included a vigil for the 17 Parkland victims who died in the shooting, and provided a space for students and other advocates to voice their concerns about gun violence. 
During the rally, Attias, Vandenberg and Wechsler called students to join together as a united front to make a difference and for USC to join the national conversation concerning student safety and prevention of violence in and out of the classroom. 
“I know that all three of us have had individuals reaching out to us and what this is doing is bringing this into a collective solidarity,” Wechsler said during the rally. “Because we cannot stand alone and be effective. What is effective is having us all standing together and uplifting our own voices.”
The rally featured representatives from political organizations calling for increased gun safety measures. Along with members of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board, the LA Brady Campaign and Moms Demand Action, Paul Wilson, the husband of one of eight people killed at a shooting in Seal Beach, Calif., in 2011 and advocate for common sense gun legislation, spoke to students as a member of Everytown for Gun Safety.
“Our kids have grown up in this environment and they finally have a voice to say enough is enough,” Wilson said. “Enough of our thoughts and prayers. We demand action and we demand action now. I am proud to be standing with them and marching with them.”
In addition to local community members, two students shared their experiences with school shootings. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School alumnus Gabe Lam, a senior majoring in business administration and accounting, spoke about his connection to Parkland and his fear  for his brother’s safety when he first heard of the shooting. Lam’s brother is a current student at the high school,  and was not harmed in the shooting. 
Tess Murray, a senior studying international relations and global business, grew up in Newtown, Conn., and was a neighbor of the gunman in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. She shared how she foresees a cultural change for future political reform concerning current gun policy. 
“America is ready for change as long as our generation stays active, stays angry, and demands action, it will happen,” Murray said. “Our generation, frequently referred to as the mass shooting generation, is driving a cultural change that will make America safer.”
March for SC encourages students to continue protesting gun violence by promoting the March for Our Lives at Pershing Square on Saturday, and is organizing transportation for students to get to the event.
“This entire movement is to show the generations before us that students are stakeholders in these issues,” Wechsler said. “Oftentimes children and young adults are disregarded when it comes to policy because they may not be informed enough or may not really understand the scope of the issue, but this is something that is directly affecting students and by uniting all these voices and standing in solidarity.”

For Matthew Weisbly, the period of Japanese internment during World War II is a crucial part of history often overlooked in school curriculums. Weisbly, a junior majoring in history, first heard about the internment when he was 12 or 13 years old from watching the film Come See the Paradise and remembered how his high school history class only spent one day on the topic. He soon realized the severity of these policies when he learned about his family’s history: Weisbly’s grandfather was a third-generation Japanese American who was detained to an Arizona internment camp.

“Ever since then, I went off and learned all I could about [the internment], and then I decided to become a history major in high school.” Weisbly said.
“When I came to USC, we had to choose a field of study for history, so I was going to do Asian and Asian American history.”
Weisbly, along with a dozen other students, are in a new history class called “War, Race and the Constitution,” which specifically concentrates on World War II Japanese internment and its present legal ramifications. Taught by Susan Kamei, USC Dornsife’s associate dean for advanced and professional degrees, it is the first class at USC that solely focuses on the internment.
Lon Kurashige, a Dornsife history professor, reached out to Kamei to teach the class since Kamei was involved in the Redress Movement, which calls for apology and reparations for Japanese Americans’ treatment during World War II. 
Kamei emphasizes that the popularized term — internment — is legally incorrect, since the U.S. technically incarcerated over 120,000 people, two-thirds of whom were Japanese Americans. 
“Internment refers to alien enemies,” Kamei said. “Legally, you don’t intern American citizens. But because that’s the way it’s known, that’s a term that we can’t get around. I avoid using the word internment and talk about the different euphemistic terminology that was used by the government, [like] relocation camp or evacuation. In the course, we refer to it as incarceration.”
In the class, students examine the U.S. Constitution and relevant   Supreme Court cases. The class visited the Japanese American National Museum and interacted with guest speakers such as Duncan Williams, a Dornsife professor of religion and East Asian languages and cultures. 
Students also have the chance to converse with Holly Yasui, the daughter of lawyer Min Yasui who fought the legality of Japanese exclusion, and Jay Hirabayashi, the son of sociologist Gordon Hirabayashi who was the plaintiff in the Hirabayashi v. United States case.
Mai Mizuno, a junior majoring in international relations and philosophy, politics and law, is a first-generation Japanese American who did not have family members incarcerated in World War II. In fact, she had never learned of the Japanese internment camps in her hometown in Manhattan, Kan., until she arrived at USC.
“It’s a very Japanese thing I think to suppress and not discuss things that were very painful in the past,” she said. “It was this crazy moment because I grew up in a very patriotic town in the Midwest, in a small town that was composed of farmers and military families. I would religiously stand up for the flag and every single day, recite the Pledge of Allegiance to this country and truly believe that it had done its best in the past to advocate for the values that were enshrined in the Constitution: equality and justice for all. To discover this in my 20s was such a shock.”
According to Kurashige, the issue is not only the lack of awareness, but also a narrow perspective on Japanese incarceration among students. He argues there is a complexity to it that is often overlooked.
“[Students] tend to see it as the equivalent for Asians to slavery,” Kurashige said. “They know it’s not the same, but in terms of what’s the worst thing that could happen or had happened to Asian Americans, the internment is just this complete utter violation of humanity … There’s an element of truth to that, and it’s not all fiction and made up, but it’s exaggerated. It’s distorted in a way that washes out the complexity of not just the experience, but of human capacity.”
Russel Hash, a senior majoring in political science and president of USC Nikkei, a Japanese American culture club, said he would have taken the class if he had had the chance. Like Weisbly’s grandfather, his grandfather and many other family members were incarcerated during World War II. Even though Hash talked with his grandfather about the experience, he still struggles to bring the topic up in conversations with those who were interned.
“How do you not talk to them about that? It’s impossible to describe,” Hash said. “You know you’re not supposed to, but you know you should. There are less and less of them every single day. If we don’t have this appropriate history, it’s going to be gone, and the moment we forget that this happened is the moment it happens again.”
Today, the legacy of Japanese American internment continues, especially through the tension between national security and civil liberties. In Kamei’s opinion, the targeting of race and ethnicity during internment has transformed into the targeting of religion, evidenced by the Muslim travel ban and the president’s suggestion for a registry system.
“After 9/11, there were cases and new congressional acts that expanded the government’s national security powers,” Kamei said. “The travel ban cases that are winding their way through circuit courts of appeal and to the Supreme Court [and the proposal] of a Muslim registry, these are issues that have come up in the past and they’re in our political landscape now. They will continue to come up in the future.”
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni noted the similarities between the World War II internment and the scope of policies enacted by the Trump administration. Although the U.S. is currently not at war with a state actor, Soni sees that the same sentiment of alienation persists.
Keeping these issues in mind, Soni believes students have an essential role in preserving history to ensure that the future will be different.
“I would hope that as students study history broadly can see, not just the Japanese American internment, [but] think deeply about why they’re studying history,” Soni said.  “It’s not just to learn about the past. It has to be also how we inform the future … That’s the power of education, that’s the power of this class, and that’s the opportunity that we have here at USC.”

For chef Phil Lee, Southern comfort food is an experience that goes beyond the meal itself: “There’s just something so amazing about it, it’s very humble yet very delicious.” Indeed, Honeybird, the latest addition to USC Village, looks like a cozy mom-and-pop eatery, with simple wooden decor, a handwritten chalkboard menu and a mouthwatering pie display. 
Photo from Yelp
Since opening, Honeybird has served students and the community with delicious fried chicken, fresh sides and delectable pies. The menu offers fried chicken à la carte, combos and sandwiches. You can’t go wrong with any of the options, but the Honeybird sandwich and the spicier Firebird sandwich are the most popular items on the menu. 
Honeybird did not disappoint. The fried chicken was absolutely delicious, and the waffle fries were so addictive that you might just go for seconds. Other go-to sides you have to try include the chipotle macaroni salad, Honeybird house salad and biscuits.
The rainbow kale and quinoa salad and roasted veggie salad use fresh market vegetables for variety. Lee says the menu stands out because of the additional healthy side options that most Southern comfort food restaurants don’t offer. 
“We do have the traditional sides like biscuits, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, but at the same time we also have healthy options like seasonal salads,” Lee said. 
For those with a sweet tooth, Honeybird offers handmade pies such as banana cream pie, salted honey pie, pecan pie and bread pudding. 
“That’s something we like to offer that still fits within the breadth of Southern comfort food,” Lee said.
After graduating from UC Santa Barbara, Lee enrolled in culinary classes at Le Cordon Bleu in Pasadena. He then found his way back to his hometown, opening the original Honeybird at La Cañada Flintridge in April 2016. The larger restaurant maintains a more family-oriented experience in the quiet town. 
All orders are conveniently packed in recyclable boxes and cups, suited to the rush of student life, a practice inspired by Lee’s college days.
“In college, I remember grabbing food and going back to my dorm or my apartment, watching TV and eating or studying and eating, so we tweaked that here because we understood the climate of students that are always on the run, always on the go,” Lee said.
There is limited seating inside the restaurant, but in the future, Honeybird will open up patio seating for students who aren’t in a rush.
Of the USC location, Lee said, “To be part of the rebirth of the Village was really amazing.” Lee stressed that he wanted to share Honeybird with the surrounding South L.A. community.
Honeybird’s service, hospitality and scrumptious fried chicken will surely appeal to the masses, and its homemade pie certainly doesn’t hurt.
Honeybird at USC Village is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Patrons can order over the phone or at the counter.

I used to be obsessed with social media. I had three Instagram accounts — one was my public account, one was a fan account for the ’90s girl group TLC and one was a satirical account where I created a “frat boy” personality as a comedic take on Greek life at USC. On Snapchat, I had over 500 “friends,” and I would send out daily videos narrating my life for all of them to see. 
The podcast DELETE THIS takes a closer look at how we use social media. Host Hank Green is a popular YouTuber, with over 795,000 followers on Twitter. Green tweets regularly, and on DELETE THIS, he goes back and reviews every tweet he posted with the help of his wife, Katherine Green. 
The nature of social media, especially on platforms like Twitter and Snapchat, is that posts exist for a relatively short amount of time before they disappear from your feed. It makes it hard to look back and reconsider what you’re putting out in a very public setting — but as DELETE THIS reveals, when you’re a few days removed from your old posts and you look back on them, you gain a new perspective. 
Green often realizes how his passion for a topic in the moment can cause him to tweet something he regrets later, and his wife makes him delete at least one tweet each week. Because of the nature of Twitter, deleting a week-old, or even day-old tweet doesn’t mean much, but it holds value in suggesting that Green shouldn’t have tweeted it in the first place, and in helping him think critically about posting similar tweets in the future.

Toward the end of my first semester at USC, I began to think more critically about my use of social media, in the same way Green does on his podcast. I realized that most of the 500 people with whom I was connected on Snapchat weren’t my friends at all, and the endless hours I spent on social media were mentally draining. 
During winter break, I conducted a complete reversal of my social media presence. I deleted my satirical “frat boy” Instagram account, and deleted all of the posts from my main account, which I rarely use, and turned the TLC fan account into a personal account with less than 25 followers. 
I also deleted my Snapchat account, and created a new one limited to just my close friends — currently, I only have 11 added. At first, this removal from social media caused me to feel left out. I didn’t get to be part of Snapchat group conversations with colleagues and acquaintances, and I would see the same posts again and again when I opened my social media apps because there were so few people on my feeds. 
But more recently, my social media scourge has been a blessing. I no longer have the urge to open my social media apps every chance I get because there are no longer constant updates for me to see, and I’m no longer constantly worried about what I post because I rarely post at all. 
DELETE THIS offers a critical look at how we can tailor social media to our own needs, rather than succumbing to algorithms designed to keep us using them as often as possible. Social media isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it’s important to know how to use it well to ensure it doesn’t consume our lives.

Despite a gloomy and rainy day at Merle Norman Stadium, the grind continued for the No. 4-ranked Trojans.

The team had just returned from the Outrigger Hawai’i Invitational in Honolulu, Hawai’i where they won three out of five matches, defeating Nebraska and Grand Canyon, while falling to Hawaii twice. While the team made no excuses for being unable to close the deal, it was evident that playing five matches in two days with limited rest on the road was a challenge.
“While our team is fit and in-shape, it was difficult playing Nebraska and Hawaii back-to-back on short rest,” said head coach Anna Collier, whose record now stands at 157-22 (.867) in her seventh year leading the team. “I would have like to have at least one match rest in between.” 
USC had played Nebraska at 11:30 a.m. before having to play Hawaii immediately after at 12:45 p.m. 
Up next for the Trojans is the Pac-12 South Invitational, where they will take on the No. 16-ranked Cal (11-1), No. 11 Arizona (9-3), No.14 Stanford (8-4) and currently unranked Arizona State. Of the four teams, USC has only faced off against Arizona State this season, whom they defeated 3-2 at the Sun Devil Challenge in Tempe, Ariz. USC holds a combined 19-0 record against the four opponents they will be matched up with this weekend. Despite their historical dominance against these Pac-12 opponents, the Trojans won’t be taking any of the matches lightly.
“We’ve been slapped in the face this season,” Collier said. “We’ve woken up now and we understand that you can never take any team for granted, ever. When you win three straight titles, the target is huge on your back. We are some teams’ national championship.”
One of the bright spots for the Trojans thus far and a duo that USC will continue to lean on for the remainder of the season is the pairing of seniors Jo Kremer and Jenna Belton. The roommates and close friends currently lead the Trojans with 14 wins thus far and play extensively on the 4th and 5th courts.
“We’ve known each other for all four years and we’ve been a pair for two years now,” Belton said. “I think knowing each other so well makes us work.”
As one of the leaders of the team, Belton mentioned that the team makes it a point of emphasis to not “dwell on what went wrong but instead focus on what we can do well on moving forward to make it better.” 
The Trojans will face the California Bears first on Saturday at 10 a.m. followed by the  Arizona State Sun Devils at 2 p.m. The following day, they’ll face the Arizona Wildcats at 10 a.m. before concluding the invitational by squaring off against the Stanford Cardinal at 1 p.m. All the matches will take place in Santa Monica, Calif.
Following the Pac-12 South Invitational, USC will compete in the Pepperdine Invitational in Malibu, Calif. on March 31. In the tournament they will face off against Saint Mary’s, No. 15 Loyola Marymount and No. 1 Pepperdine.

All eyes were on Cromwell Field on Wednesday as Sam Darnold showed off in the rain to make his case to be the top overall pick at the NFL draft next month. The now-former Trojan superstar impressed in front of all 32 teams while the NFL Network broadcasted his Pro Day around the country.
Unfortunately for Trojan fans, Darnold’s contributions to USC are now limited to being an ambassador at the next level. He can no longer add to the trophy cabinet in Heritage Hall, and he’s done scrambling around the Coliseum — at least on Saturdays. But there are plenty of other squads to root for on campus, from the third-ranked women’s water polo team to the men’s golf program and Justin Suh: the nation’s top collegiate player.
One of the best shows on campus plays just down the road from where Darnold held his workout. A few nights before cameras gathered all over Cromwell, the baseball team took down Utah 5-2 at Dedeaux Field to earn a series victory to open Pac-12 play. History was made during the opener on Thursday, when the Trojans no-hit the Utes behind 7-2/3 wicked frames from freshman Kyle Hurt, who was pitching just his fourth career game.
USC isn’t ranked, nor is its 11-6 record threatening to break into the national conversation, but the roster is certainly a lot of fun to watch. Head coach Dan Hubbs’ side dropped an 8-7 thriller against UC Irvine on Tuesday night after staging two separate rallies to fight back from deficits of 4-0 and 7-5. The Trojans beat No. 11 UCLA in Dodger Stadium two weeks ago and have played to a strong 8-3 record at home so far this spring. Their only dropped series to date was a trip to Arkansas against the fifth-ranked Razorbacks (the Trojans gave up two runs in the final frame to lose the rubber game 7-6). Other than the team’s visit to Irvine this week, USC’s only one-off defeat came versus No. 8 TCU.
It’s impressive stuff for a program that was picked to finish third-from-bottom in the Pac-12 in the preseason media poll. With a roster featuring a mix of steady veterans and inexperienced energy, could this year’s Trojans stage a surprise postseason chase for the first time since 2015? As young prospects like Hurt begin to carve out their legacies, can seasoned players like junior Lars Nootbaar and Brad Wegman cement theirs with a run at the College World Series?
Hopeful as fans may be, it is still far too early to even dream of what lies beyond the next two months — or even two series. I made the mistake of buying in too early last season, when I penned a column at a similar point during the 2017 campaign. USC was 15-8, with two series wins to begin the conference schedule after being picked to finish second-to-last in the Pac-12. It was an eerily familiar start: a strong home record coupled with a marquee win over the Bruins in Chavez Ravine.
“It seemed like the Trojans were back on the road to a championship before last season’s stumble,” I wrote. “Perhaps this year’s underdog side is about to get things on track again, no matter what the experts may predict.”
Turns out, the experts were spot-on. The Trojans imploded over the final two-thirds of the season, stumbling to a 6-26 record the rest of the way and finishing tied for last in the conference. After compiling a 27-27 record in 2016, USC dropped to 21-34 in 2017, lowlighted by a rough 6-20 mark away from home.
So, as excited as I am for the Trojans’ potential this spring, I will not jinx them again. Being honest, it seems pretty obvious what awaits them in their next series: a three-game set on the road against No. 3 Stanford. It’s hard to imagine USC will pose much of a challenge to the high-flying Cardinal, who boast a 14-2 record (10-1 at home).
And once the Trojans return from the Bay Area, their schedule quickly becomes unforgiving. Just look at this stretch beginning in mid-April: a home series against a traditionally strong Arizona program (picked to finish fourth in the Pac-12), then a crosstown visit to UCLA followed by back-to-back unenviable trips to Eugene, Ore. and Pullman, Wash., and finally, a home date versus defending conference champion Oregon State — who totaled six losses over the entirety of last season for a 56-6 record.
With such towering roadblocks standing in USC’s way, I fully expect Hubbs’ squad to watch the postseason from home. No matter how precocious the team may be, the strength of the Pac-12 as a whole appears too high to expect the Trojans to punch above their weight over the course of a full campaign.
Then again, they did nearly steal a series away from the fifth-ranked program in the country just a few weeks ago — all the way in Fayetteville, Ark., no less. Let’s see if USC can make a statement and go one better this weekend.

Currently holding an overall 6-15 record, and 2-5 in conference, the USC Men’s Volleyball team has struggled to find their rhythm this season. However, they will face No. 4 UC Irvine at home this Saturday coming off a solid road win against Stanford last weekend.

After falling in the first set 21-25, the Trojans came back and won three straight sets to take the match. Senior outside hitter Jack Wyett lead the team offensively with 15 kills and one ace. Freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis made a significant impact with 12 kills and six blocks by the end of the night, also contributing two aces. Junior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso had an outstanding service performance with three aces and an additional seven kills. Junior outside hitter Ryan Moss boasted a .438 hitting percentage with his seven kills. Setters freshman Chris Hall and redshirt senior Gert Lisha successfully ran their 6-2 offense with 18 and 22 assists, respectively. Freshman libero Cole Paxson lead the team in serve receive and defensively with five digs. 
“There was more energy throughout the team, and we played more as a cohesive unit,” Wyett said. “With that, everything else just followed. We made our serves a lot down the stretch. [Lewis] was a big factor for us during crunch time. And our defense was pretty tenacious throughout the whole match. The mentality throughout was super strong in comparison to our other matches.” 
As for Stanford, freshman opposite hitter Jaylen Jasper led the team with 20 kills along with freshman outside hitter JP Reilly, who added 13 kills. Junior setter Russell Dervay put up 43 assists with the help of senior libero Evan Enriques who had a .973 reception percentage and 13 digs. The Cardinal made a total of 28 errors to USC’s 16, leaving them with little room for victory. 
This Saturday the Men of Troy will return home to play UC Irvine in a non-conference match. They will rely on their big hitters, Wyett, Lewis, Grasso, and Moss, along with Lisha and Hall as setters. Sophomore opposite Aaron Strange weighed in on what they need to do technically to beat the Anteaters. 
“We definitely have to take their angle away because they are an angle dominant hitting team,” Strange said. “They don’t really hit balls extremely hard. They are very shotty. Our back row defense needs to be prepared to pick up tips. As for serving goals, we need to serve hard and not let that interfere with our mental game.” 
They will be looking at Paxson and libero Matt Douglas to defend against their shots. 
With a more mental view of the game, Wyett spoke to their team goals. 
“We need to go in with the mentality that we can beat them,” Wyett said. “They have a couple really good guys. And I think if we can shut them down in the early part of the match it will instill the mentality that we are capable of beating any team.” 
The Trojans will need to defend against the Anteaters coming off a win against UC San Diego. Freshman middle blocker Austin Wilmot was named Big West Defensive Player of the Week this week after average 1.82 blocks over 11 sets. In their most recent match against the Tritons, he put up 13 blocks. 
Also in their last match, senior outside hitter Aaron Koubi put up 12 kills. He was followed closely by junior opposite hitter Karl Apfelbach and freshman outside hitter Joel Schneidmiller who each added 11 kills. Defensively, sophomore middle blocker Scott Stadick had 4 blocks and senior outside hitter David Parker contributed 8 digs. 
The Trojans will need to defend and strategically put the ball away by avoiding their block. They will look to improve their record and gain more momentum for their last few games of the season, ending with a match-up against UCLA on March 31.
