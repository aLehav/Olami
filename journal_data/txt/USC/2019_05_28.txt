USC’s baseball team visited No. 12 Oregon State over the weekend, handing the defending national champions a series loss to conclude the 2019 season with a 13-15-1 conference record and a 25-29-1 overall record.
The Trojans defeated the Beavers by a score of 2-0 in the series opener. USC took an early 1-0 lead when junior infielder Tyler Pritchard delivered an RBI single in the second inning. Junior outfielder Matthew Acosta added to the lead in the fifth inning with an RBI single of his own giving the Trojans a 2-0 lead.
Sophomore pitcher John Beller shut out the Beavers through seven innings. Beller was effective all night, allowing only six baserunners and striking out nine batters on the evening. 
“[Oregon State] is a dominant team, they’re explosive,” Beller said. “I was able to just go out there and trust my defense.”
The two runs provided by the Trojan offense proved to be enough for Beller and the bullpen as they would combine to shut out Oregon State. The Beavers came close to scoring in the last inning, but junior outfielder Brady Shockey robbed a potential home run and sealed the 2-0 victory.
“[Shockey] made an unbelievable play in the ninth,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We were fortunate that we were able to make [a two-run lead] hold up.”
The Trojans were unable to carry the momentum over from the series opener, and fell in game two. USC had a bases-loaded opportunity with one out in the first inning, but only scored a single run.
Oregon State responded to the Trojans’ early rally and hit three home runs, knocking in five runs in the first four innings. Senior infielder Brandon Perez countered the home run barrage with a solo shot over the left field wall in the fifth. However, neither team scored again and the game concluded at 5-2 as Oregon State evened the series.
Despite taking the loss, pitcher Connor Lunn struck out ten batters, a new career high for the junior. 
The Trojans clinched the series win Saturday, rolling to a 5-0 win. Sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez got USC on the board by scoring Owens on a sacrifice fly in the second inning. Acosta added a run for the Trojans in the sixth with an RBI single that fell into left field.
Sophomore pitcher Kyle Hurt protected the two run lead by holding the Beavers scoreless through seven innings. He struck out nine batters while allowing only six total baserunners.
“[Hurt’s] performance was big time,” Hubbs said. “He dominated from start to finish, pitched out of a couple jams, and had some huge punchouts in between.”
USC scored three more insurance runs in the ninth inning to seal the game.
A key part of shutting down Oregon State’s offense over the weekend was quieting OSU’s catcher Adley Rutschman, who is en route to a likely first overall selection in the 2019 MLB Draft. 
In the two games the Trojans won, the switch-hitting Rutschman, who hit .419 on the season, went a combined 0-5. 
The Trojans entered the final series following a loss to UC Irvine last Tuesday. USC started the game strong, scoring four runs in the first two innings. Acosta provided two of these runs in the second inning with a single to left field. 
Despite the early offensive effort, the Trojans were shut out for the rest of the game, and the Anteaters scored seven unanswered runs. USC did total ten hits, but they were unable to capitalize and fell by a score of 7-4.
The series win against a strong Beavers team allowed the Trojans to end a somewhat disappointing season on a positive note. 
“[This series win] means a lot to us,” Hurt said. “It’s given us a lot of joy and happiness.”

After nearly a month of postseason play, the men’s and women’s tennis teams finished off their seasons last Thursday and Friday. Although each team had their rough challenging matches, the 2018-19 season was an improvement from last year for both teams. 
After finishing third in the Pac-12 during the 2017-2018 season, the men’s team improved to second place this season, just behind crosstown rival UCLA. The women’s team, which finished fourth to last in the Pac-12 last season, finished fourth this year in the Pac-12. Both teams also sent at least one player to the NCAA individual championships for singles and/or doubles. 
The Men of Troy started off their postseason play in the NCAA team tournament as the eighth seed. After beating both Northern Arizona and San Diego without dropping a single point, the men’s team was eliminated in the round of 16 when they were defeated 1-4 by No. 9 North Carolina.
The men’s season did not end there, as they sent three singles players and one doubles team to the NCAA tournament. Junior Brandon Holt, sophomore Daniel Cukierman, and senior Tanner Smith competed in the singles tournament for the Trojans.
All three players advanced to the round of 32, but only Holt emerged victorious. In the round of 16, Holt overcame a first set loss, earning him a spot in the quarterfinals. Holt’s quarterfinal appearance was the first for the Trojans since 2012, when Stevie Johnson went on to win the NCAA title. Holt lost his quarterfinal match to No. 1 senior Nuno Borges of Mississippi State.
The Trojans’ doubles team consisted of Holt and junior Riley Smith, who came in as the No. 10 seed, but did not make it out of the first round, losing in a three-set match to No. 8 Texas A&M sophomores Carlos Aguilar and Barnaby Smith.
On the women’s side, USC entered the NCAA tournament as the No. 13 seed. Like the men’s team, the women advanced to the round of 16 without dropping a single point. The Trojans did not make it past this round, however, losing to the No. 4 South Carolina Gamecocks 0-4.
The women’s team sent one singles player and one doubles duo to the women’s NCAA tournament. Freshman Salma Ewing was the lone Trojan to compete in the singles tournament, falling in the first round against No. 19 Marta Gonzalez, a junior from Georgia, in a three-set match.
The doubles team, consisting of junior Angela Kulikov and senior Rianna Valdes, made it to the semifinals, the farthest for both the men’s and women’s team. 
“It’s a huge accomplishment for the girls to be the third Trojan pair to reach the NCAA Semifinals,” said head coach Alison Swain.
The pair cruised to the semifinals in Orlando without dropping a single set in their first three matches.
“We’ve been playing our best doubles all week but still getting better with each match. It’s exciting to be putting on such great performances and still know we can do even better tomorrow,” Kulikov said.
The Trojans faced a familiar foe in the UCLA team of seniors Gabby Andrews and Ayan Broomfield in the semifinals. The Women of Troy were no match for their crosstown rivals, losing in consecutive sets, 4-6, 4-6.
Even though USC was not able to crown a national champion this season, both teams have a lot to be proud of. The men’s team finished their season with an overall record of 22-8, only dropping one conference match. The women’s team finished their season with a record of 20-8, only losing three conference matches. Both teams seek to improve their performance next season, hoping to add that elusive championship banner to Marks Stadium.

Within the vast cyber space that is Twitter, there exists many smaller neighborhoods, each devoted to discussing different interests — NBA Twitter, stan Twitter, feminist Twitter and film Twitter, among others. That last one may conjure images of film school students, movie snobs and wannabe critics discussing perfect cinematography and their favorite foreign films. Yet, there is one user who provides a much needed pin to deflate any pomposity film Twitter may have — Jim Cummings. 
Cummings wrote, directed and starred in his first feature film, “Thunder Road,” which premiered at the South by Southwest festival in 2018. Since gaining widespread critical acclaim for the movie, he has become the primary advocate for independent filmmaking — he takes to Twitter almost daily, insisting that anyone can write, produce, shoot, edit and distribute their own movie, just like he did. His mantra? Make movies and make them with your friends. 
Last Saturday, I gathered a group of friends and finished a short film on an iPhone in just three hours. No matter the quality of the end product, I feel an immense satisfaction in just having shot something that I wrote. It’s no wonder Cummings is such a vehement advocate for people to just make movies. With the rise of accessible technology, it’s never been easier.
Movies are leading two lives right now: On one hand, we get big budget spectacles that have to be seen in theaters (“Avengers: Endgame,” “Godzilla: King of the Monsters”). On the other hand, more people are making their own films than ever before. Anyone with a cellphone can shoot a short film or even a full feature. Cummings is something of a patron saint for this type of DIY filmmaking. In one tweet, he wrote, “Show off your film gear.” The picture beneath was of a solitary iPhone 7.
That’s what I used last Saturday. My iPhone 7, coupled with a BeastGrip to hug the device for more stable filming. Just a couple decades ago,  to shoot my short I would have needed to get a film camera, learn how to operate it, develop the film, splice, edit, etc. — it would take excessive training, along with a large chunk of my wallet. Today, filmmaking is as simple as opening up an app. I didn’t have to wait for anything to develop to see how my film turned out — I just pulled it up on my laptop. In two weekends, I had all the footage I needed. 
In the next couple decades, a new generation of writers, directors, editors and cinematographers will step into the scene. These individuals will be the people who went out and shot whatever they could with whatever they had — they learned through their scrappy filmmaking, and armed with a bigger budget, there’s no telling what they could do. Yesterday, it was Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron leading the charge. Today, it’s Damien Chazelle, Ryan Coogler, Jordan Peele and Barry Jenkins. Tomorrow, it could be anyone.

Georgetown University announced last week that it will expel two students involved in the nationwide college admissions bribery case. In doing so, it follows the lead of peer institutions like Stanford and Yale, sending a stern warning that students who benefit from “side doors,” intentionally or not, will suffer.
This clarity is absent in USC’s vague decision-making process. In April, the University released a public statement announcing that it has continued a “thorough review of the student-athlete admissions process” and “placed holds on the accounts of students who may be associated with the alleged admissions scheme.” However, this same statement stops short of applying the ultimate sanction to implicated students, instead falling back to its promise of a “case-by-case review.”
“Case-by-case” fails as an acceptable rubric because its implied vagueness allows far too much room for arbitrary discretion. Even if investigators do use a concrete, rigorous rubric, the University’s decision to omit its existence is still problematic, especially within the context of an already-secretive admissions process. 
Students and faculty continue to call for transparency and accountability at USC, and this process should be no exception.  After all the distrust engendered by scandal after scandal, USC owes it to the public to abandon such rhetoric altogether and unilaterally expel those associated with the admissions scheme.
Although the solution is simple, the temptation is strong to view the implicated students as innocent, even victims of their parents’ wrongdoing. The underlying assumption here is that being unaware of wrongdoing committed on one’s behalf excuses that person from liability.
Existing regulatory precedent, however, states that ignorance is no excuse. In its April public statement, the University said that it uses the Common Application’s attestation, which includes the stipulation that “I may be subject to a range of possible disciplinary actions, including admission revocation, expulsion, or revocation of course credit, grades, and degree should the information I have certified be false.” Given that the only criteria for disciplinary action is falsehood, not prior knowledge, USC has more than enough right to expel students associated with the scheme.
In fact, the idea that an applicant is truly ignorant of the contents of their college application is truly ridiculous. One of the conditions that every applicant using the Common Application must agree to is that all information is their own work, which naturally extends to the submission process. And if the applicant is unable or unwilling to personally invest in the paperwork of their own college application, they have no business attending college in the first place.
More importantly, expelling implicated students restores justice to the admissions system. Given that the goal of college application fraud is to secure an undeserved spot in a prestigious university, denying admission and diplomas from that university prevents unethical behavior from reaping undeserved benefits.
At a time when USC is dubbed the “University of Scandals and Corruption,” it is unreasonable to believe that sweeping scandal-linked students under the rug through “case-by-case” rhetoric will bring permanent closure to this scandalous episode. 
Instead, the University must join its fellow universities in taking decisive action to prevent anyone from benefiting from corruption in the admissions process. 
Rescinding admission to all students implicated in the college admissions scheme is the first step toward restoring transparency to USC’s rhetoric and a trusting relationship with the campus community.

Three months ago, six USC alumni came forward with sexual harassment allegations against Dennis Kelly, a former medical provider at the Engemann Student Health Center. These students identify as gay or bisexual and alleged that Kelly had targeted his abuse based on their sexuality. In recent weeks, the number of plaintiffs has climbed to 50, and USC has yet to issue an apology or announce what actions will be taken. By failing to act in response to the allegations, USC proves that it hasn’t learned from its past failures involving campus sexual violence. 
Following the outbreak of sexual harassment allegations against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, the University made several administrative changes with the intention of establishing more transparent, accountable leadership. They created the Office of Professionalism and Ethics, established the Office of Ethics and Compliance and hired new staff to oversee these departments.
Despite the changes, the University’s response to the Kelly lawsuit is alarmingly reminiscent of the fallout of the Tyndall case. 
USC must recognize that it is the University’s duty to mitigate the pain of the victims and mend the rift between the school and its LGBTQ community, a rift caused by its own negligence and failure to protect its students.
Reporting sexual harassment is an emotionally taxing process, and having those reports reach national headlines, as they did in the Kelly lawsuit, can make it even more difficult. According to researchers at the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, satisfaction with the reporting process is directly associated with well-being. More specifically, when victims feel that their reports are validated and addressed by authorities, they show fewer symptoms of PTSD and better overall post-harassment outcomes.
USC has failed to validate and address these reports properly, undoubtedly compounding the renewed stress that victims experience after reporting their sexual harassment. University authorities must recognize that their stalling causes further damage to the victims’ well-being, which was already jeopardized by the school’s failure to protect them.
It is possible that in these months of silence, the administration has discussed the lawsuit internally. However, by not revealing the nature of such discussions, the University is proving that it will still operate behind closed doors despite calls for transparency. For an issue with such a profound impact on the safety and wellness of the student body, especially an underrepresented group, students have the right to know the University’s planned course of action.
University leaders throw around words like “accountability” and “integrity” in much of their communications with the campus community, so the administration’s refusal to address the allegations against Kelly defies the values that USC espouses. 
In an email to the USC community following a $215 million class action settlement USC agreed to in response to lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by Tyndall, Interim President Wanda Austin promised that USC’s leaders “are listening carefully, learning from these experiences.” Despite this, it seems that testimonies from Kelly’s alleged victims and outrage from the USC community have gone unheard, and the administration has yet to learn how to respond to sexual abuse allegations.
While the President’s Office acted and communicated more promptly than it had in the past when allegations of admissions bribery emerged in March, it seems that the same diligence does not apply when it comes to sexual harassment. This is worrying, considering the prevalence of sexual abuse cases on college campuses, and it sets a disturbing precedent in how future cases of sexual misconduct will be handled.
Carol Folt’s presidency begins on July 1, ushering in a new era of leadership at USC. She, along with the current administration, must take responsibility and provide the justice that victims of Kelly’s alleged abuse deserve.

“When I say Whack, you say Whack!” were the first words that a sunshine-clad Tierra Whack shouted to her audience on Sunday afternoon at the Soundset hip-hop festival in Minneapolis. Whack wore bright yellow Balenciaga sweatpants and avant garde makeup that featured a rain cloud on one eye and a sun covering the other. 
The Philadelphia native took the hip-hop music scene by storm over the past year — after performing at USC’s 2018 Conquest concert, she went on to perform at Coachella and South by Southwest and is set to take the stage at Lollapalooza and Outside Lands.  
Whack’s debut album, “Whack World,” is something of an internet sensation, with its 15 one-minute tracks comprising a step away from traditional album formats. Packed with lyrical and musical ingenuity, “Whack World” saw much critical acclaim in 2018 from industry outlets like Billboard and Pitchfork.
Throughout early 2019, Whack released more one-minute songs, likely snippets from her next album. 
As Whack’s rise continues, she’s proving that it really is a “Whack World,” and we’re just living in it.

“My job as the chief of staff was to keep all the engines running.”
Dennis Cornell, who has served as chief of staff for two presidents, and worked under three, will retire June 30 after being at the University for almost 30 years.
The chief of staff position reports directly to the president, managing their daily tasks and acting as a liaison between them, the senior administration and the Board of Trustees. According to a job posting on USC’s website, the University is actively searching for a new chief of staff who can “[think] strategically, making complex decisions in an extremely fast paced and sensitive environment.”
“A chief of staff is connected to the president they serve,” Cornell said. “When [Nikias] stepped down, technically I stepped down. They rehired me the next day to work with [Interim President Wanda Austin].”
Although Cornell said President-elect Carol Folt asked him to stay on while she searched for her own chief of staff, Cornell said it was time for a new era for the University. 
“New presidents get to have their own chiefs of staff and their own teams, and that’s the way it should be,” Cornell said. “They need to have their own sense of trust with people.”
Cornell’s background in the entertainment industry, such as serving as vice president of casting and talent development for Columbia Pictures Television and Sony Pictures Television, lent him to the arts, he said. When he served as chief of protocol and associate senior vice president in 2001, Cornell oversaw the artistic direction of about 200 USC programs per year. Cornell helped create the arts and humanities initiative Visions and Voices and oversaw special projects such as the University’s 125th anniversary celebration. 
Cornell first came to the University as a visiting professor at the School of Dramatic Arts in 1991. He then served as the managing director of SDA and was later appointed executive director of University events in 1995. 
While working as chief of protocol, Cornell worked closely with C.L. Max Nikias when the former president was the dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering. When Nikias was named president in 2010, he asked Cornell to be his chief of staff.
Under Nikias, Cornell represented USC in visits to South Korea among other countries, the Daily Trojan previously reported.
“[Doing this job,] you learn every day about how to grow and how to be more transparent … more accountable to our constituents,” Cornell said. “I’ve probably learned more in the last two years than I’ve learned ever at USC — and I’ve learned a lot here.” 
Cornell said his retirement is bittersweet, but he is ready to return to his roots in the theater arts, likely serving as the chair of the Pasadena Playhouse and traveling the world to see theater.
“[He] is one of the most familiar and friendly faces on our campuses,” Interim President Austin wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “He has been an advisor to many of his colleagues and an excellent sounding board for me during this critical transition period. We will very much miss his daily presence on our campuses and wish him much happiness in retirement.”

It’s not just the friendly staff, warm atmosphere and good coffee that draws students to the USC Village Dulce day after day. Many come specifically for the breakfast burrito. 
The USC community gobbles up breakfast burritos in an outsized way compared to other Dulce items. The question ‘why? is a Mystery Gang worthy mystery. So I sought to figure it out.
The USC Village Dulce, which opened its first brick and mortar location in 2011 in Little Tokyo, never expected the breakfast burrito to become a top seller. If you look at their menus, it says breakfast items are only sold until 11 a.m. even though they can now be ordered all day.
According to statistics gathered by general manager Eugene Lee, the kitchen made more than 17,000 breakfast burritos just in the past semester.  They sold more than four  times as many as the second-highest kitchen-prepared dish (their pesto chicken sandwich) during the spring 2019 semester.
“Our average burrito sale when we first opened was around 50 [or] 60 [per day]. And then last year we were hitting 100 and we were going crazy, ‘oh my gosh we’ve sold 100 breakfast burritos.’ Whereas now we’re selling 200 daily,” Lee said. “Because the demand for it was so high, we ended up serving it all day.”
The breakfast burrito contains bacon, sausage, avocado, salsa, scrambled eggs, potatoes, red onions, jack cheese and a spicy mayo that Pierson Carlsen, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies, dubbed “a tantalizing mystery.” It’s also convenient, tasty, and, according to Lee, cost-effective, giving a student the most “bang for the buck,” especially when compared to other shops in USC Village.
“If you look at all other shops [at USC Village], I think an average food item is a little bit more than ten bucks,” Lee said. The breakfast burrito currently costs $8. And as for convenience: “You just need to unfoil the burrito, and you can eat it wherever you’re going,” Lee said.
“I don’t usually eat bacon and cheesy things, so it’s kinda like my cheat meal,” said Helen Gratch, who graduated in May. “I like how it’s a whole breakfast in one thing.”
In an effusive compliment, Carlsen called the breakfast burrito a “succulent beast that often goes unnoticed.” However, based on the numbers of burritos sold last semester, the breakfast burrito is clearly no longer a neglected menu item.
While Lee, who has been working at Cafe Dulce for nine years, loads up his breakfast burrito with avocado, bacon and sausage, none of the other employees interviewed mentioned the breakfast burrito as their favorite item to eat.
“When I first started here I literally had the burrito like three times a week,” said Elaine Oh, one of Dulce’s assistant managers. 
As Oh worked longer however, she began to branch out and found a new favorite: the apple tuna sandwich, which — based on the list provided by Lee — comes up at a distant ninth, at 1650 sold in the past semester.
Kevin Castillo, another assistant manager, said he believes the success of the burrito stems from its ingredients. However, he prefers the off-menu breakfast bowl to the burrito, customizing it a certain way with no mixed greens, adding turkey and Dulce’s spicy mustard.
The breakfast sandwich is “actually our staff favorite, but a lot of people don’t know about it,” Lee said. “We make our own bread in house, over easy eggs, and then we have ham, arugula and a spicy mustard on it. A lot of people say that it’s better than the breakfast burrito.”
When Lee asked if I wanted to get a burrito to go, I had to think hard. After all, I had never tried the breakfast sandwich. However, I can now confirm that while the sandwich is tasty, it’s definitely no breakfast burrito. The hype is justified; the breakfast burrito is truly the best Dulce has to offer.
